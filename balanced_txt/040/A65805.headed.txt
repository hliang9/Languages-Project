TINTINNALOGIA: OR, THE ART OF RINGING. WHEREIN Is laid down plain and easie Rules for Ringing all sorts of Plain Changes. Together with Directions for Pricking and Ringing all Cross Peals; with a full Discovery of the Mystery and Grounds of each Peal. AS ALSO Instructions for Hanging of Bells, with all things belonging thereunto. By a Lover of that ART. A. Persii Sat. V. Disce: sed ira cadat naso, rugosaque sanna, LONDON, Printed for F.

TO THE NOBLE SOCIETY OF COLLEDGE-YOUTHS. GENTLEMEN, I Have seen a Treatise, intitu∣led, de Tintinnabulis— that is, of little Bells, the Language Latin, but pen'd by a Dutchman, being a Discourse of striking Tunes on lit∣tle Bells with traps under the feet; with several Books on several In∣struments of Musick, and Tunes prick't for the same: Then con∣sidering that the Well-wishers to ither of them, took great pains to make plain the use of them, I hought it worth a Dayes labour, o write something on this Art or Science, that the Rules thereof
might not be lost and obscured to some, as the Chronicles be∣fore William the Conqueror, being given only by Tradition from Fa∣ther to Son. Wherefore I humbly intreat you favourably to accept this small Treatise, as a foundation whereon may be raised a famous Structure; and if any one objects a fault, excuse it with the Ringing term—He was Over-bell'd— So you will much oblige him that is a Well-wisher to your Recre∣ation, CAMPANISTA.
On the Ingenious Art of RINGING. WHat Musick is there that compar'd may be To well-tun'd Bells enchanting melody! Breaking with their sweet sound the willing Air, And in the listning ear the Soul ensnare; The ravisht Air such pleasure loth to lose, With thousand Echoes still prolongs each close; And gliding streams which in the Vallies trills, Assists its speed unto the neighbouring Hills; Where in the rocks & caves, with hollow grounds, The warbling lightsome Element rebounds. This for the Musick: In the Action's Health, And every Bell is a Wil's Common-wealth: For here by them we plainly may discern, How that Civility we are to learn. The Treble to the Tenor doth give place, And goes before him for the better grace: But when they chance to change, 'tis as a dance, They foot A Galliard, a' la mode de France. An Eighteenscore's a figure dance, but Grandsire Hath the Jig-steps: & Tendrings Peal doth answer The manner of Corants: A plain Six-score, Is like a Sarabaend, the motion slower. When Bells Ring round, and in their Order be, They do denote how Neighbours should agree;
But if they Clam, the harsh sound spoils the sport, And 'tis like Women keeping Dover Court▪ For when all talk, there's none can lend an ear The others story, and her own to hear; But pull and hall, straining for to sputter What they can hardly afford time to utter. Like as a valiant Captain in the Field, By his Conduct, doth make the Foe to yield; Ev'n so, the leading Bell keeping true time, The rest do follow, none commits a Crime: But if one Souldier runs, perhaps a Troop Seeing him gone, their hearts begin to droop▪ Ev'n so the fault of one Bell spoils a Ring, (And now my Pegasus has taken Wing.)
Upon the Presentation of GRANDSIRE BOB To the COLLEDGE-YOVTHS, By the AUTHOR Of that PEAL. GEntlemen of the Noble Crew Of Colledge-Youths, there lately blew A wind, which to my Noddle flew (Upon a day when as it Snow;) Which to my Brains the Vapors drew, And there began to work and brew, Till in my Periranium grew Conundrums, how some Peal that's New Might be compos'd? and to pursue These thoughts (which did so whet and hew My flat Invention) and to shew What might be done, I strait withdrew My self to ponder—whence did accrue This Grandsire Bob, which unto you I Dedicate, as being due Most properly; for there's but few
Besides, so ready at their Q— (Especially at the first View) To apprehend a thing that's New; Though they'l pretend, and make a shew, As if the intricat'st they knew; What Bob doth mean, and Grandsire True, And read the course without a Clue Of this new Peal: Yet though they screw Their shallow Brains, they'l ne're unglue The Method on't (and I'm a Jew) If I don't think this to be true, They see no more on't than blind Hugh. Well, let their tongues run Titere tu, Drink muddy Ale, or else French Lieve, Whil'st we our Sport and Art renew, And drink good Sack till Sky looks blew, So Grandsire bids you All adieu. R. R.
THE ART OF Ringing. Of the Beginning of Changes. IT is an ancient Proverb with us in England (That Rome was not built in a day) by which expression is declared, That difficult things are not immedi∣ately done, or in a short time accom∣plished: But for the Art of Ring∣ing, it is admirable to conceive in how
short a time it hath increased, that the very depth of its intricacy is found out; for within these Fifty or Sixty years last past, Changes were not known, or thought possible to be Rang: Then were invented the Sixes, being the very ground of a Six score: Then the Twen∣ty, and Twenty-four, with several other Changes. But Cambridge Forty-eight, for many years, was the greatest Peal that was Rang or invented; but now, neither Forty-eight, nor a Hundred, nor Seven-hundred and twenty, nor any Number can confine us; for we can Ring Changes, Ad infinitum. Although Philosophers say, No Number is infi∣nite, because it can be numbred; for in∣finite is a quantity that cannot be taken or assigned, but there is (infinitum quoad nos) as they term it, that is infinite in respect of our apprehension: There∣fore a Ringers knowledge may seem in∣finite to dive so infinitely into such an infinite Subject; but least my Discourse should be infinite, I will conclude it, and proceed to the Peals following. Before I Treat of the method and di∣versity of Peals, I think it not imperti∣nent to speak something of the Proper∣ties
wherewith a Young Ringer ought to be qualified, and then proceed to the Peals. First then, before he is entred into a Company, it is presupposed, that he is able to Set a Bell Fore-stroke and Back-stroke, as the terms are: Next, that he know how to Ring Round, or Under-sally: Then, that he may be complete, it is convenient, that he un∣derstand the Tuning of Bells; for what is a Musitian, unless he can Tune his Instrument, although he plays never so well? To do which, let him learn on some Instrument, or Wyer-Bells, to know a Third, Fifth, and Eighth, which are the principal Concords: Or otherwise, let him get a Pipe called a Pitch-pipe, which may be made by any Organ-ma∣ker, to contain eight Notes, or more, (according to his pleasure) with their Flatts and Sharps, which will be very useful in the Tuning of Bells. And then this is a general Rule, begin at the Ten∣nor, or biggest Bell, and count 3 whole Notes, then a half Note, or Sharp, 3 whole Notes, then a half Note, or Sharp; and so on, until you come to the least Bell or Treble. For example on four Bells, 1:234, here the 432 are whole
Notes, and the half Note or Sharp is between 1 and 2. On Five Bells, 12:345 the 543 are whole Notes; and the half Note or Sharp is between 2 and 3. On Six, 123:456 the half Note or Sharp is between 3 and 4. On Eight Bells, 1:2345:678, one half Note or Sharp is between 5 and 6 and the other between 1 and 2. On Ten, 123:4567:8910; here one half Note is between 7 and 8, and the next between 3 and 4. On Twelve Bells, 12:345:6789:10 11 12. Here one half Note or Sharp is between 9 and 10, the next between 5 and 6, and the other between 2 and 3, which last is made contrary to the for∣mer Rule, it being but two whole Notes from the next half Note to it; the reason is this, the Ninth is one whole Note below the Eighth, therefore the 2 must be a whole Note below the Treble, otherwise they would not be a true Eighth, therefore the half Note is put between 2 and 3. Now he that hath these Rules, and a good ear to judge of the Concords, may at any time cast his Verdict (as to Bells, whether they are well in Tune or not) amongst the chief of the Company.
Of the Changes. A Change is made between two Bells that strikes next to each other, by removing into each others pla∣ces, as in these two Figures 1, 2. make a Change between them, and they will stand 2, 1. which is called a Change; make another Change between them, and they will stand in their right places, as at first, 1, 2. These two Changes are all that can be made on two Bells. The Changes on three Bells. On three Bells there are six several Changes to be made; in Ringing of which, there is one Bell to be observed, which is called the Hunt, and the other two are Extream Bells (but they can∣not properly be so called, because every Bell hunts in the six Changes; yet be∣cause 'tis commonly Rang by observing a Hunt and two Extream Bells, I will therefore proceed in that course.) The name of Hunt is properly given to it, because of its continual motion up and
down amongst the other Bells, which mo∣tion is called Hunting, and the other two are called Extream Bells, because when the Hunt is either before or be∣hind them, that is at the Extream, or utmost place, there is a Change then to be made between them, called an Ex∣tream Change. There are two several wayes to Ring the six Changes. One whereof is to make the Treble the Hunt, and the other way is to make the Tenor the Hunt. I will give an Ex∣ample in hunting the Treble, the Bells are supposed to stand thus.— 123 Now the Treble must be hunt∣ed up over the Second and Third, which is to be done, by making a Change between the Treble, and each of those two Bells in order; therefore first I remove the Tre∣ble up over the Second, into the seconds place, by making a Change between the Treble and Second, thus.— 213 The Treble being removed up over the Second, it must next be removed up over the Third, as in this Change.— 231
Alwayes observe, that when the Hunt moves from the foremost Bell to∣ward the hindmost, then it hunts up, as in the Changes next before; but when it moves or hunts from the hindmost Bell, toward the Bell that leads, then it hunts down, as appears by the Changes following. The Treble being hunted up behind the Extream Bells, an Ex∣tream Change is next to be made be∣tween them.— 321 Here you may observe, that if the Hunt had been hunted down without an Extream Change first made, those Changes in hunting it down, would have been the same with those that were made in hunting it up. The Extream Change being made, the Treble must be hunted down again before the Bells thus.— 312 132 The Treble being now hunted down, the next is to be an Ex∣tream Change.— 123 which is the last Change of the six. The other way to Ring the six Changes, is, to make the Tenor the Hunt, which being behind already, it
must first be hunted down, as in these Changes.— 123 132 312 The Third, which is the Hunt, being hunted down before the Bells, the Extream Change must next be made between the 2, and 1. which are the Extream Bells, thus.— 321 The Extream Change being made, the Third must be hunt∣ed up again.— 231 213 The Third being hunted up, another Extream must be made, which brings the Bells round in their right places.— 123 The Plain Changes on four Bells. On four Bells, there are Twenty four several Changes, in Ringing of which, there is one Bell called the Hunt, and the other three are Extream Bells; the Hunt moves, and hunts up and down continually, and lies but once in one place, except only when it comes be∣fore or behind the Bells, at which time it lies there twice together; it has the same course here, as in the six Changes be∣fore
set down; two of the Extream Bells makes a Change every time the Hunt comes before or behind them. An Example I will here give, making the Treble the Hunt, and the Extream Changes I make between the two far∣thest Extream Bells from the Hunt. I set down the four Figures, representing the four Bells, thus.— 1234 The Treble must now be hunted up behind the Bells, where it is to lie twice to∣gether, and then to hunt down before them, where it must lie twice, and then hunt up again as before. The Hunt is al∣wayes one of the two Bells which makes every Change, except only when it comes be∣fore or behind the Bells, and it moves only over one Bell at a time; 'tis to be hunted up after this manner.— 2134 2314 2341 The Treble being hunted up behind the Bells, as appears by the last Changes, the next is to be an Extream Change be∣tween the two farthest Ex∣tream Bells from the Hunt,
which are the Second and Third, thus.— 3241 3214 3124 1324 The Extream being made, the Treble must be hunted down again, as in these Changes.— The Treble being hunted down, there is another Extream Change to be made between the two farthest Bells from it, which are the Second and Fourth.— 1342 3142 3412 3421 4321 The Extream being made, the Treble must be hunted as before, and so to the end of the Peal, making an Extream Change every time the Hunt comes before and behind the Bells.— 4312 4132 1432 1423 4123 4213 4231 2431 2413 2143 1243 1234 The Twenty-four Changes are to be Rang another way, in hunting up the Treble, which is, by making every Extream Change between the two nearest Bells to the Hunt, as in these Changes, first I hunt the Tre∣ble up.— 1234 2134 2314 2341 The Treble being hunted up, the Extream Change is to be made between the 3, and 4. which are the two nearest Bells to it, as in this Change, and so to the end of the Peal, making every Extream between the two nearest Bells to the Hunt all the way. 2431
These two wayes in Ringing the Twenty-four, differs only in making the Extream Changes, one whereof is to make them between the two farthest Extream Bells from the Hunt, and the other to make them between the two nearest Bells to it. The Twenty-four Changes are to be Rang two wayes more in hunting down the Treble; one way, is to make the Extreams between the two farthest Bells from the Hunt; and the other, is to make them between the two nearest, as before. A short Example I will set down, the Bells stand thus.— 1234 1243 2143 2413 2431 4231 4213 4123 1423 1432 4132 4312 4321 3421 3412 3142 The Treble should now be hunted down, but it being al∣ready before the Bells, inso∣much that it can be removed no lower; therefore the first must be an Extream Change, either between the two nea∣rest, or two farthest Bells from the Hunt at pleasure; the Ex∣tream being made, the Treble is to hunt up, and so to the end of the Peal, in the same course as before. In hunting the Second, Third,
or Fourth, there is to be observed the same course, as in hunting the Treble: A short Example I will set down, in hunting the Third up, and making the Extream Changes between the two far∣thest Bells from it.— 1234 1243 2143 2134 2314 3214 First, I hunt up the third over the fourth; the Hunt being up, I make an extream between the treble and second, and then hunt down the third again, as in these changes, which course is to be observed to the end of the Peal. I have insisted the longer upon the di∣rections to the Twenty-four changes, be∣cause it is the ground and method in Ringing all plain changes; and by un∣derstanding this aright, the Learner will more easily apprehend the course of all plain and single changes whatsoever. The Twenty-four plain changes are to be Rang sixteen several wayes; in hunt∣ing one Bell, it is to be Rang four ways; that is, two wayes in hunting it up, and the other two wayes in hunting it down, (as appears in my directions before in hunting the treble:) so that in hunting the 4 Bells, 'tis to be Rang 4 times 4 wayes, which makes 16, some of which I have here set down.
Treble Hunt up, Extream between the 2 farthest Bells from it. 1234 2134 2314 2341 3241 3214 3142 1324 1342 3142 3412 3421 4321 4312 4132 1432 1423 4123 4213 4231 2431 2413 2143 1243 1234 Second up, ex∣tream between the 2 nearest to it. 1234 1324 1342 1432 1423 1243 2143 2413 4213 4123 4132 4312 4321 4231 2431 2341 3241 3421 3412 3142 3124 3214 2314 2134 1234 Fourth down, Extream be∣tween the two farthest Bells from it. 1234 1243 1423 4123 4132 1432 1342 1324 3124 3142 3412 4312 4321 3421 3241 3214 2314 2341 2431 4231 4213 2413 2143 2134 1234 Some persons do observe to Ring the Twenty-four changes with a whole Hunt, and half Hunt; but that is an imperfect course; for there cannot be one half hunt only, but there will unavoidably be three half Hunts in one and the same Twen∣ty-four; therefore I have set down the other way to ring it, by observing a hunt, and three extream Bells, which course is much more easie and true.
In the Twenty-four Changes are con∣tained the six Changes; the three Ex∣tream Bells in the Twenty-four, makes the six Changes in course, every extream change being one of the six, and the Hunt hunting through each of the six Changes, makes Twenty-four: For Ex∣ample, take the three Extream Bells in the first Twenty-four set down before, which are 234, and set down the six Changes on them, thus.— 234 324 342 432 423 243 234 Now take the first Change, which is 234, set the Treble before it, and hunt it through, thus.— 1234 2134 2314 2341 The Treble being hunted up behinde, take the next Change of the six, which is 324, set it directly under the First, and hunt the Treble down through it, thus.— 3241 3214 3124 1324 And so take each of the other six Chan∣ges, and hunt the Tre∣ble through them, it will make Twenty-four.
I will here insert two or three old Peals on five Bells, which (though re∣jected in these dayes, yet) in former times were much in use, which for An∣tiquity sake, I here set down. And first, The Twenty all over. The course is this—every Bell hunts in order once through the Bells, until it comes behind them; and first the Tre∣ble hunts up, next the Second, and then the 3 4 and 5, which brings the Bells round in their right places again, at the end of the Twenty Changes, as in this following Peal.— 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 32451 34251 34521 34512 43512 45312 45132 45123 54123 51423 51243 51234 15234 12534 12354 12345 This Peal is to be Rang, by hunt∣ing the Bells down, beginning with the Tenor, next the fourth, and so the third, second, and tre∣ble, which will bring the Bells round in course as before.
An Eight and Forty. In this Peal, the Fifth and Fourth are both whole Hunts, each of which does hunt down before the Bells by turns, and lies there twice together and then hunts up again: The 1, 2 and 3 goes the six changes, one of which is made every time, either of the whole Hunts lies be∣fore the Bells, as in the following Chan∣ges, where the fifth hunts down the first; and lying before the Bells, there is a change made between the 1 & 2, which is one of the six changes; and then the fifth hunts up again into its place, and the fourth hunts down, which lying be∣fore the Bells, there is another of the six changes made between the 1 and 3, and then the fourth hunts up again, and the fifth hunts down next; in which course it continues to the end of the Peal, each of the whole Hunts lying but twice at one time before the Bells, as in these fol∣lowing changes. 12345 12354 12534 15234 51234 52134 25134 21534 21354 21345 21435 24135 42135 42315 24315 23415 23145 23154 23513 25314 52314 53214 35214 32514 32154 32145 32415 34215 43215 43125 34125 31425 31245 31254 31524 35124 53124 51324 15324 13524 13254 13245 13425 14325 41325 41235 14235 12435 12345
Cambridge Eight and Forty. Wherein it is observed, that the Tre∣ble and Second does never come be∣hind, neither does the Fifth and Fourth come before, as in the fol∣lowing Changes. 12345 21345 21354 21534 25134 25314 23514 23154 32154 32514 35214 35124 31524 31254 31245 31425 34125 34215 32415 32145 23145 23415 24315 24135 21435 21453 24153 24513 25413 25143 21543 12543 15243 15423 14523 14253 12453 12435 14235 14325 13425 13245 13254 13524 15324 15234 12534 12354 12345
The Plain Changes on five Bells. There are Six-score Changes to be Rang on five Bells, which are to be Rang, by observing a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three Extream Bells; the course of the whole Hunt, is the same with the Hunt in the Twenty-four Changes, and hunts up and down in the same manner. The half Hunt moves once, that is, over one Bell eve∣ry time, the whole Hunt comes before and behind the Bells; but when the half Hunt is removed either before or behind the Extream Bells, then there is an Extream Change to be made. For Example, I make the Treble the whole Hunt, and hunt it up; and the Second the half Hunt, and half hunt it up, making every Extream Change between the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt; the Extream Bells are the Third, Fourth, Fifth: Now observe, that whereas in the Twenty-four Chan∣ges, an Extream Change was alwayes made, when the whole Hunt came before or behind the Bells, in these Six-score
Changes an Extream is alwayes to be made, when the half Hunt comes be∣fore or behind the Extream Bells; first the Treble is to be hunted up, as in these Changes.— 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 The whole Hunt being hunt∣ed up, the Second, which is the half Hunt, must be hunted up over one Bell, as in this Change.— 32451 The half Hunt being re∣moved up over one Bell, the whole Hunt must be hunted down again, as in these Chan∣ges.— 32415 32145 31245 13245 The whole Hunt being hunt∣ed down, the half Hunt is to be removed up over the Fourth, which is the next Bell to it.— 13425 The whole Hunt is to hunt up as before.— 31425 34125 34215 34251 Now the half Hunt is to be hunted up over the Fifth, which is the next Bell to it, thus.— 34521 Here the Second, which is the half Hunt, is removed quite up behind the Extream
Bells; yet the Extream Change is not to be made, until the whole Hunt has re∣moved down through the Bells, as in these Changes.— 34512 34152 31452 13452 And it is a constant Rule, that whensoever the half Hunt has removed up be∣hind the Extream Bells, or down before them, the whole Hunt must hunt through the Bells, before the Extream Change is made, as in the last Change but four, which is 3, 4, 5, 2, 1. the Second be∣ing the half Hunt, is re∣moved up behind the 3, 4, and 5. which are the Ex∣tream Bells; and then the whole Hunt being behind, hunts immediately down; and now the Extreame Change is to be made be∣tween the 3, and 4. which are the two farthest Ex∣tream Bells from the half Hunt, as in this Change.— 14352 The Extream being made, the whole Hunt and half
Hunt and o remove again; and first the whole Hunt must be hunted up.— 41352 43152 43512 43521 Now the half Hunt is to be hunted down under one Bell, thus.— 43251 The half Hunt being re∣moved, the whole Hunt is to be hunted down.— 43215 43125 41325 14325 The half Hunt is to be removed down under an∣other Bell, as in this Change.— 14235 Now I hunt up the Tre∣ble.— 41235 42135 42315 42351 The Treble being hunted up, I hunt down the Second before the Extream Bells.— 24351 Now I hunt down the Treble again, and then make the Extream Change, as in these Changes.— 24315 24135 21435 12435 12453 The last is the Extream Change, which is made be∣tween the Third and Fifth; and this course is to be ob∣served to the end of the Six-score
Changes, which is set do at large at the end of the directions to this Peal. Another short Example I will insert, which is Second down, and Fourth up, (for that is the common Phrase amongst Ringers) whereby 'tis alwayes to be observed, that the first Bell which is na∣med, is the whole Hunt, and the second that is named, is the half Hunt, as here∣in you may perceive; where Second down, is meant, that the Second Bell is the whole Hunt, and to hunt down the first Change; and the Fourth Bell is the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bell the first time it moves at the begin∣ning of the Peal; which are only di∣rections in making the first Changes, for one whole Hunt and half Hunt may be hunted several wayes, either up or down at pleasure. First, I hunt down the Second.— 12345 21345 The Second being hunted down, the Fourth, which is the half Hunt, must be re∣moved up over one Bell, thus.— 21354 The half Hunt being re∣moved, I must hunt up the
Second, as in these Changes.— 12354 13254 13524 13542 31542 31524 31254 32154 23154 23145 Now the Fourth, which is the half Hunt, being be∣hind the Extream Bells, the next is to be an Extream Change, which may be made either between the two far∣thest Bells from the half Hunt, or the two nearest to it; and after the Extream Change is made, the whole Hunt and half Hunt must be hunted as before. These Six-score Changes of Second and Fourth, I have set down at large, at the end of my directions to these Changes on five Bells. In every Six-score, the Extream Changes may be made either between the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, or between the two nearest to it, observing to make all the Extreams in one Six-score alike; that is, if you make the first Extream Change between the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, you must make all the following Extreams in the same Six score between the two farthest Ex∣tream
Bells also; or if you make the first Extream in any Six-score between the two nearest to the half Hunt, you must make all the following Extreams in the same Six-score between the two nearest also. The Six-score plain and single Chan∣ges, are to be Rang Eight-score several wayes; for although there are but Six-score several Changes on five Bells, yet by altering the whole Hunt, the half Hunt, and Extreams, the course of the Changes are so altered, that the same Changes doe not come all along toge∣ther in any two of those Eight-score wayes. With one whole Hunt, and half Hunt, the Six-score Changes are to be Rang, or set down eight several wayes; one way, is by hunting the whole Hunt, and half Hunt both up; the second way, is by hunting the whole Hunt and half Hunt both down; the third way, is in hunting the whole Hunt up, and the half Hunt down; the fourth way, is by hunting the whole Hunt down, and the half Hunt up; each of these four wayes is to be Rang two wayes more; one is, in making the Extreams between
the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, and the other way is in ma∣king them between the two nearest; for Example, in making the treble the whole Hunt, and second the half Hunt, the Six-score are to be Rang eight several wayes (viz.) Extream Changes to be made between the 2 farthest Ex∣tream Bells from the half Hunt. Treble and second both up— Treble and second both down— Treble down, and second up— Treble up, and se∣cond down— Extream Changes to be made between the two nearest Extream Bells to the half Hunt, which is called Mediums. Treble and second both up— Treble and second both down— Treble down, and second up— Treble up, and se∣cond down— On five Bells there are 20 Hunts, (i. e.) a whole Hunt, and half Hunt twenty times, and not one; and the same whole Hunt, and half Hunt twice, as
appears by the following Figures, where they stand two and two together; one of which is the whole Hunt, and the other the half Hunt: for Example, the 2 highest Figures are 1.2 where the treble is the whole Hunt, and the second the half Hunt. The two next Figures are 1.3 where the treble is the whole Hunt, and the third the half Hunt; and likewise the two last, or lowest Figures, are 5.4 the fifth is the whole Hunt, and the fourth the half Hunt; and so of all the rest, the first Figure representing the whole Hunt, and the next to it the half Hunt. 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 2.1 2.3 2.4 2.5 3.1 3.2 3.4 3.5 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.5 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 So that here being twenty Hunts, and every one making eight Six-scores (as in the Ex∣ample of treble and second) that is twenty (which are the number of Hunts;) multiplied by eight (which are the number of Six-scores made by each Hunt) does produce Eight-score several wayes to Ring the Six-score Changes.
In the Six-score Changes are com∣prehended the Twenty-four, and the Six Changes: The Twenty-four Chan∣ges are made between the half Hunt, and the three Extream Bells; and the Six are made between the Extream Bells alone: The half Hunt in the Six-score, is the whole Hunt in the Twenty-four; and there is one Change in the Twenty-four made every time the whole Hunt comes before and behind the Bells; and one Change in the Six made every Extream: So that the Six-score rightly understood, is no∣thing else but hunting the half Hunt through every Change of the Six, which makes Twenty-four Changes; and then hunting the whole Hunt through each Change of the Twen∣ty-four, which makes Six-score; for instance, in the first Six-score before set down, where the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the 345 the Extream Bells.
I take the Extream Bells, and set down the six Changes on them thus.— 345 435 453 543 534 354 345 Now I take the first of the six, which is 345, and set the second (which was the half Hunt in the Six-score) to it, and hunt it up behind thus.— 2345 3245 3425 3452 Now I take the second Change of the six, which is 435, and set it directly un∣der 345, and the second Bell to it, and hunt it down thus.— 4352 4325 4235 2435 The second being hunted through the Change, I take the third Change in the six, which is 453, and hunt the second Bell through it, as before.— 2453 4253 4523 4532 And in the same course, the second being hunted through each Change of the six, will make Twenty-four, one Change of the six, hunt∣ing the second Bell through it, makes four Changes; so that the six Changes by hunting the second through
each of them, will make six times four Changes (i. e.) Twenty-four. And now hunt the Treble through each of the Twenty-four Changes, and 'twill make Six-score; the first of the Twenty-four is 2345, take the Treble, and hunt it through it thus.— 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 Now take the next Change of the Twenty-four, which is 3245, set it under the other Change, and hunt the Treble through it thus.— 32451 32415 32145 31245 13245 And in the same manner, hunting the Treble through each Change of the Twenty-four, will produce Twenty-four times five Changes, which makes Six-score; one Change of the Twenty-four (in hunting the Treble through it) makes five Changes. In every Six-score on 5 Bells, there are 6 Extream Changes, there being twenty Changes from one Extream to another. It would be an endless undertaking to set down all these Peals at large, but for the convenience of the Learner, I have set down some part of several of them, which may with ease be prickt out to the end of each Peal, as the Learner plea∣ses.
Note, That in the following Peals there is a Line drawn at each Extream Change between the Figures, to shew where the Extreams are made; as in the next Peal there is a Line drawn between the Figures just 20 Changes from the beginning of the Peal, the Change next after the Line is the Extream Change, which is 14352, and so of the rest; the Change next following each Line is the Extream. Treble and second both up, Extream be∣tween the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt. 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 32451 32415 32145 31245 13245 13425 31425 34125 34215 34251 34521 34512 34152 31452 13452 — 14352 41352 43152 43512 43521 43251 43215 43125 41325 14325 14235 41235 42135 42315 42351 24351 24315 24135 21435 12435 — 12453 21453 24153 24513 24531 42531 42513 42153 41253 14253 14523 41523 45123 45213 45231 45321 45312 45132 41532 14532 — 15432 51432 54132 54312 54321 54231 54213 54123 51423 15423 15243 51243 52143 52413 52431 25431 25413 25143 21543 12543 — 12534 21534 25134 25314 25341 52341 52314 52134 51234 15234 15324 51324 53124 53214 53241 53421 53412 53142 51342 15342 — 13542 31542 35142 35412 35421 35241 35214 35124 31524 13524 13254 31254 32154 32514 32541 23541 23514 23154 21354 12354 — 12345

The Changes on six Bells. On six Bells there are Seven-hundred and twenty Changes to be made; but there are Peals of Six-score and Twelve-score Changes to be Rang on them. The Six-score Changes are to be made, by observing a whole Hunt and half Hunt, which are to be hunted in the same course, as in the Six-score on five Bells, and the Exrream Changes to be made by the same Rule as they were on five Bells. The only difference between the Six-score on six Bells, and those on five, are this; whereas on five there are but three Extream Bells, on six there are four Extream Bells. And on five Bells, there are six Extream Changes in every Six-score; but on six, there are but four Extream Changes. And moreover, whereas in every Six-score on five Bells, the Changes were the same in each, al∣though altered in course; but the Chan∣ges on six Bells are not the same in each, for several Six-scores has several Chan∣ges, one Six-score having many Chan∣ges which another has not, as in this Peal, treble and second both up; which is,
123456 213456 231456 234156 234516 234561 324561 324516 324156 321456 312456 132456 134256 314256 341256 342156 342516 342561 345261 345216 345126 341526 314526 134526 134562 314562 341562 345162 345612 345621 — 435621 435612 435162 431562 413562 143562 143526 413526 431526 435126 435216 435261 432561 432516 432156 431256 413256 143256 142356 412356 421356 423156 423516 423561 243561 243516 243156 241356 214356 124356 — 124365 214365 241365 243165 243615 243651 423651 423615 423165 421365 412365 142365 143265 413265 431265 432165 432615 432651 436251 436215 436125 431625 413625 143625 143652 413652 431652 436152 436512 436521 — 346521 346512 346152 341652 314652 134652 134625 314625 341625 346125 346215 346251 342651 342615 342165 341265 314265 134265 132465 312465 321465 324165 324615 324651 234651 234615 234165 231465 213465 123465 — 123456
There are other Peals to be Rang on six Bells, as Six-scores on the five smal∣lest, the tenor lying behind all the way. Treble and second, or treble and fifth, with the tenor lying behind, makes very good Musick: Of which Peals I need not give you any Example, these Six-scores being the same with those on five Bells set down before. The Twelve-score Changes being only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty, and consequently the course of each being one and the same, I will therefore shew the course and method of the Seven-hundred and twenty, wherein the Twelve-score Changes are also in∣cluded. In Ringing the Seven-hundred and Twenty, there is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, a quarter Hunt, and three Ex∣tream Bells; the whole Hunt and half Hunt does hunt in the same course and method, as they did in the Six-score on five Bells, and in the last Six-score; and the quarter Hunt removes in the same course under the half Hunt, as the half Hunt does under the whole Hunt: for instance, when the whole Hunt is hunted either before or behind the Bells, then
the half Hunt removes over one Bell; and when the half Hunt is removed be∣fore or behind the quarter Hunt and Ex∣tream Bells (at which time in a Six-score the Extream is made) then the quarter Hunt removes over one Bell, in the same course as the half hūt moves, when the whole Hunt is before or behind. An Example I will set down, which is 1.2 and 3 all up, that is to say, treble the whole Hunt, and to hunt up, second the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, and third the quarter Hunt, and to quarter hunt up 4, 5 and 6 are Extream Bells; there is alwayes an Extream Change to be made, when the quarter Hunt comes be∣fore or behind the Extream Bells, there are two wayes to make the Extreams, which are the same here, as in the Six-score on five, and made by the same Rule, I will here make it between the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter Hunt. Now the treble and second being the whole Hunt and half Hunt, must be hunted in the same course, as in the Six-score on five Bells, after this manner.

124536 214536 241536 245136 245316 245361 425361 425316 425136 421536 412536 142536 145236 415236 451236 452136 452316 452361 453261 453216 453126 351326 415326 145326 145362 415362 451362 453162 453612 453621 The whole Hunt and half Hunt being hunted up, the quarter Hunt must be removed quite up over the sixth, as in this Change 456321, the quarter Hunt being hunted up behind the Ex∣tream Bells, yet the Extream Change is not to be made, until the whole Hunt and half Hunt have both removed thorough the Bells, as in these Changes. 456312 456132 451632 415632 145632 145623 415623 451623 456123 456213 456231 452631 452613 452163 451263 415263 145263 142563 412563 421563 425163 425613 425631 245631 245613 245163 241563 214563 124563
It is to be observed for a constant Rule, that when the quarter Hunt re∣moves either quite up behind the Ex∣tream Bells, or down before them, the whole Hunt and half Hunt must hunt through the Bells before the Extream Change is to be made, as appears by the last Changes. The Extream Change is now to be made between the 4 and 5, being the two farthest Extream Bells from the third, which is the quarter Hunt, thus.— 125463 The Extream being made, the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt must be hunted as before; and first the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to be hunted up, as in these Changes. 215463 251463 254163 254613 254631 524631 524613 524163 521463 512463 152463 154263 514263 541263 542163 542613 542631 546231 546213 546123 541623 514623 154623 154632 514632 541632 546132 546312 546321
The whole Hunt and half Hunt being hunted up, the quarter Hunt must hunt down under the sixth, which is the next Bell to it, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt must hunt down again, as in the Changes following. 543621 543612 543162 541362 514362 154362 154326 514326 541326 543126 543216 543261 542361 542316 542136 541236 514236 154236 152436 512436 521436 524136 524316 524361 254361 254316 254136 251436 215436 125436 The quarter Hunt must be hunted down under the Fourth, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to hunt up again, as appears by these Changes. 125346 215346 251346 253146 253416 253461 523461 523416 523146 521346 512346 152346 153246 513246 531246 532146 532416 532461 534261 534216 534126 531426 513426 153426 153462 513462 531462 534162 534612 534621
Now the quarter Hunt is to be hunt∣ed down before the Extream Bells, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt to hunt again before the Extream Change is made. 354621 354612 354162 351462 315462 135462 135426 315426 351426 354126 354216 354261 352461 352416 352146 351246 315246 135246 132546 312546 321546 325146 325416 325461 235461 235416 235146 231546 213546 123546 The quarter Hunt being before the Ex∣tream Bells, the Extream Change is to be made: Here are just Twelve-score Changes already set down, and the Bells may ei∣ther be brought round, and so make an end at the Twelve-score, or else proceed forward to the end of the Seven hun∣dred and twenty. If the Bells are not brought round here, they cannot come round, until the Seven-hundred and twenty Changes are all made, and then they come round in course. To bring the Bells round at the end of these
Twelve-score Changes, the Extream is to be made between the 5 and 4, which were the two Bells that made the last Extream Change, and brings them round in their right places again, as appears by these Figures 123456. There are but two Extream Changes in every Twelve-score, wherein 'tis con∣stantly observed, that the last Extream Change is to be made between those two Bells which made the first Extream, otherwise the Bells would not come round at the end of the Twelve-score. Here I have somewhat deviated from my directions before, in making the Ex∣tream Changes; for in the last Change, which is 123456, I made the Extream between the two nearest Extream Bells to the quarter Hunt; but the Twelve-score Changes are an imperfect Peal, be∣ing only a third part of the Changes which are to be made on six Bells, and therefore not to be brought round, unless the last Extream Change is made out of course. To have proceeded forward in the 720, the last Extream should have been made between the 4 and 6, which are the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter Hunt, the Change next before
the Extream, is 123456; now the 4 and 6 making an Extream Change, the Bells stand thus, 123564; the Extream being made, the whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt are to be hunted as be∣fore, and the Extream Changes to be made between the two farthest Extream Bells from the quarter hunt, which course will bring the Bells round in their right places at the end of the 720. In every 720, there are six Extream Chan∣ges, there being Six-score Changes be∣tween each. The Twelve-score Changes are to be Rang with any whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt, observing to make the last Extream Change between those two Bells which made the first. The 720 plain Changes are to be rang or set down One thousand four hun∣dred and forty several wayes, by altering the whole hunt, half hunt, quarter hunt, and Extream Bells (but the course of each is the same with that which is be∣fore set down) which I thus demonstrate. On 6 Bells, there are 120 several hunts, (viz.) a whole hunt, half hunt, and quar∣ter hunt Six-score several times, and not one and the same whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt twice, as appears by these Figures.—

The next three Figures are 124, there the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quar∣ter Hunt; and the last three Figures are 654, where the sixth is the whole Hunt, the fifth the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt, and so of all the rest. With one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, the Seven-hundred and twenty Changes are to be Rang, or set down twelve several wayes; for in∣stance, take the first three Hunts in these Figures, which are 123, where the tre∣ble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the third the quarter Hunt, which may be hunted six several wayes, as followeth. Treble, second and third, all up-— Treble and second up, third down- Treble up, second and third down Treble, second and third, all down- Treble and second down, third up- treble down, second and third up— Each of these are to be Rang two wayes, one is to make the Extreams between the two farthest Ex∣tream Bells from the quarter Hunt, and the other way is to make the Extream between the two next Bells to the quarter Hunt.
By treble, second and third all up, is meant, that the treble is the whole hunt, and to hunt up the first Change at the beginning of the Peal; the second is the half hunt, and to half hunt up; that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bells the first time it moves at the beginning of the Peal; and the third is the quar∣ter hunt, and to move likewise toward the hindmost Bells the first time it re∣moves. And by treble and second up, and third down, is meant, that the treble and second are to move up towards the hindmost Bell, the first time each re∣moves at the beginning of the Peal; and the third being the quarter hunt, is to move down the first time, which are on∣ly directions for moving the hunts at first, because they may be hunted either up or down. Sometimes it happens, that the hunts cannot be hunted that way which is pro∣posed, as in the 720, treble, second and third all down.— 123456 The whole hunt which is the treble, should now be hunted down; but it be∣ing already before the Bells, insomuch that it can be removed no lower; I should therefore remove the half hunt
down, but that being also down as low as it can go, I should move the quarter hunt; and that being also down before the Extream Bells, I can move it no lower, unless I should move it down under the second, which is the half hunt, which must not be done; for when the quarter hunt is down next before the Extream Bell, it must be removed no lower; and when it is up next behind the Extream Bell, it is to be removed up no higher; therefore it being now be∣fore the Extream Bell, the Extream Change is to be made the first of all; and when that is done, the treble, second and third must be hunted up in course. Or if you make treble and second down, and third up, then the first Change is to be made, by moving the quarter Hunt up over one Bell. And again, if you make Treble and Tenor both up, and Third down, first hunt up the Treble, and then the Tenor, which is the half Hunt, should be moved up; but it being al∣ready behind, the quarter Hunt, which is the Third, must move under one Bell, and then the whole Hunt and half are to hunt in course after each other: Many Examples of this Nature I could set
down, which for brevity sake I o∣mit. I might demonstrate how the 720 are to be Rang twelve wayes, with each of the Six-score Hunts, as I did that of tre∣ble, second and third; but I think that altogether needless, since that Example makes it most plain and easie to be un∣derstood: But I will give a general Rule for hunting any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, so as to produce six several wayes to Ring the 720 Changes, which is this: Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, all hunted up. Whole Hunt, and half Hunt hunted up, and quarter Hunt down. Whole Hunt hunted up, half Hunt and quarter Hunt down. Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt hunted down. Whole Hunt and half Hunt hunted down, and quarter Hunt up. Whole Hunt hunted down, half Hunt and quarter Hunt hunted up. Which is a general Rule to Ring the 720 six wayes on any one of the Six-score
Hunts; each of which six wayes, may be Rang two wayes more, by al∣tering the Extream Changes, one of which is to make the Extream Changes between the two next Extream Bells to the quarter Hunt, and the other way is to make the Extreams between the two farthest Extream Bells from it. The 720 Changes are to be Rang 12 wayes with one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; so that with the Six-score Hunts, it is to be Rang Six-score times twelve wayes, which makes One thousand four hundred and forty several wayes to Ring this 720 plain Changes. In the 720, the half Hunt, the quar∣ter Hunt, and the three Extream Bells, makes the Six-score Changes on 5 Bells in a perfect course, the half Hunt and quarter hunt in the 720, being the whole Hunt and half Hunt in the Six-score; for Example, take the 23456, and set down the Six-score Changes on them, making the second the whole hunt, and the third the half hunt; which when you have set down, then take the Treble, and hunt it through every Change of that Six-score, and it will make 720 Chan∣ges, the same with those which I have
set down before. The Twenty-four Changes on four Bells, and the six chan∣ges on three Bells, have also a perfect course in the 720, in the same manner as I told you they had in the Six-scores on five Bells. There is alwayes one change in the Six-score made every time the whole hunt comes before or behind the bells, which is every sixth change; and there's one change of the Twenty-four made, every time the whole hunt and half hunt comes before or behind the bells, which is once in thirty chan∣ges; and one change of the six made every extream, that is once in six-score changes. You may take the six-score changes on five bells, treble the whole, and second the half hunt, before set down; and hunt the sixth bell through every change of that six-score, which will make the 720 changes; Tenor the whole hunt, Treble the half hunt, and Second the quarter hunt. This is not material for a Learner to know, it being only for the instructi∣ons of those that know how to Ring it, but yet are ignorant of the true grounds thereof; therefore I have dis∣sected it, and shewed the grounds of each part of it.
In this place, I will add a word or two to those that practise to Ring the Changes. THey that Ring the extream bells in the Twenty-four changes, must mind and observe the motion of the hunt, that they may the better know when to make the extream changes; and likewise in a six-score on five bells, he that Rings the half hunt, must observe the motion of the whole hunt; and they that Ring the extream bells, must observe the motions both of the whole hunt, and half hunt, that they may know when the half hunt is to move, and also when to make the extream changes; or else he that does Ring the half hunt, may give notice of the extream changes (by say∣ing Extream) the change next before the extream is to be made. The same is to be observed in the changes on six bells. The whole hunt is the easiest bell to Ring in any changes, and the half hunt is more plain and easie to Ring, than an extream bell. All changes are to be Rang either by walking them (as the
term is) or else Whole-pulls, or Half-pulls. By walking them, is meant, that the bells go round, four, six, eight times, or more, in one change, which is commonly used by young Practisers; it may be sometimes on five bells, Ring∣ing the Twenty-four changes on the treble, second, third, and fourth, the fifth bell striking behind every change; and many other changes of the like nature may be practised this way by young Ringers. Whole-pulls, is to Ring two Rounds in one change, that is, Fore-stroke and Back-stroke, and in a change; so that every time you pull down the bells at Sally, you make a new change differing from that at the Back-stroke next before; this Whole-pulls was al∣together practised in former time, but of late there is a more quick and ready way practised, called Half-pulls, which is—only once round in a change, that is, one change made at the Fore-stroke, and another at the Back-stroke, which way is now altogether in use (unless it be at some great bells, which are too weighty to be managed up so high a Compass at the Back-stroke, as Half-pulls requires) it being now a common thing in London
to Ring the 720 Changes, Trebles and Doubles, and Grandsire Bob, Half-pulls, (which is commonly Rang with so round and quick a Compass, that in the space of half an hour, or little more, the 720 Changes are Rang out from the beginning to the end.) And also the Six-scores Doubles and Singles, Old Doubles, Grandsire, and many other cross Peals on five bells, are commonly Rang Half-pulls. In Ringing Half-pulls, some Peals do cut Compass, that is—the whole hunt comes to lead at the Back-stroke, to remedy which, make the first change of the Peal at the Back-stroke. By these following Rules, you shall know what Peals do cut Compass, and what not (i. e.) of plain and single changes. On six Bells, In hunting either the treble, the third, or the fifth bells down, cuts Compass; hunting them up, does not cut Com∣pass. In hunting the second, fourth, or sixth bells up, cuts Compass; but hunting them down, does not cut Compass.
These Rules (leaving out the Ten∣nor) serves for five bells; and leaving out the fifth and Tenor, they serve for four bells. The Twelve score LONG-HUNTS: Or the ESQVIRE'S Twelve-score. THis Peal is to be Rang on six bells, having two whole hunts, and one half hunt; the common way of Ring∣ing, it is to make the fifth and Tenor the whole hunts, and the Treble the half hunt. The Tenor and fifth does each hunt down by turns, and when either of them comes down before the bells, it leads twice, and then hunts up again. The Treble, second, third, and fourth, makes the Twenty-four chan∣ges, one of which is made every time either of the whole hunts leads: For instance, the Tenor is first to be hunt∣ed
down, thus.— 123456 123465 123645 126345 162345 612345 The tenor being hunted down, and lying before the bells, there is one change in the Twenty-four now to be made between treble and second, thus.— 621345 261345 216345 The tenor is to be hunted up into its place, and the fifth hunts down.— 213645 213465 213456 213546 215346 251346 521346 The fifth being now before the bells, there is another change in the Twenty-four to be made between the treble and third, as in this change.— 523146 253146 235146 231546 231456 231465 231645 The fifth is now to hunt up, and the tenor to hunt down a∣gain, in which course they continue to the end of the Peal, observing to make an extream change, when the treble (which is the hunt in the Twenty-four) comes before or behind the ex∣tream bells. This Peal may be Rang, by makg the Twenty-four changes Doubles and
Singles, in the place of the Twenty-four plain Changes, and many other wayes, which I leave to the Learner to practise. The Variety of Changes on any Num∣ber of Bells. THe changes on bells do multiply infinitely. On two bells there are two changes. On three bells are three times as many changes as there are on two; that is—three times two chan∣ges, which makes six. On four bells there are four times as many changes as on three; that is—four times six chan∣ges, which makes Twenty-four. On five bells there are five times as many changes as there are on four bells; that is—five times Twenty-four changes, which makes Six-score. On six bells are six times as many changes as there are on five; that is—six times Six-score changes, which makes Seven-hundred and twenty: And in the same manner, by increasing the number of bells, they multiply innumerably, as in the Table of Figures next following; where each of
the Figures in the Column of the left hand, standing directly under one an∣other (which are 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.) do represent the number of bells; and the Figures going along to∣wards the right-hand, directly from each of those twelve Figures, are the num∣ber of changes to be rung on that num∣ber of bells which the Figure represents: For Example, the uppermost Figure on the left hand is 2, which stands for two bells; and the Figure next to it on the right hand is also 2, which stands for two changes; that is to say, on two bells there are two changes. The next Figure below in the left Column is 3, which stands for three Bells; and the Figure next to it on the right hand is 6, which stands for six changes; that is—on three bells are six changes, and so of the rest as follows.
bells changes. 2 2 3 6 4 24 5 120 6 70 7 5040 8 40320 9 362880 10 3628800 11 39916800 12 479001600 The lowest of these figures are 479001600, that is, Four hundred seventy nine Millions, one thousand six hundred, which are all the changes that can be made on twelve bells: And sup∣posing that twelve men should take 12 bells with intent to ring the changes on them, they would be Seventy five Years, ten Months, one Week and three Dayes in ringing them, according to the pro∣portion of ringing 720 changes in an hour; reckoning 24 hours to the day, and 365 dayes in the Year.
Having given Directions for all sorts of plain and single Changes, I will now prceed to Cross-Peals, and first to Doubles and Singles on four Bells. Doubles and Singles on four Bells. ON four bells there are 24 changes to be made Doubles and Singles, wherein are twelve double changes, and 12 single; next to every double change, there is a single; so that 2 double changes do not come together in any place throughout the Peal, neither does two single changes at any time come to∣gether; but one change is double, and the next is single, to the end of the Peal. Every double change is made between the four bells; that is—there are two changes made at one time, between the bells in treble and seconds places, and the bells in third and fourths places. Every single change is made between the two bells in the middle (i. e.) in seconds and thirds places; excepting the extream changes, which are single, and made between the two farthest ex∣tream bells from the Hunt. An Example
I here set down, making the treble the Hunt, and I hunt it up at the beginning of the Peal (for it may be hunted ei∣ther up or down at pleasure) and I make an extream change every time the whole Hunt comes before the bells. In ringing it, 'tis observed, that every bell hunts in course, and lies twice before, and twice behind, except only when the extream is to be made, and then the two farthest extream bells from the Hunt, does make a dodge, and then moves in their former course, as in these changes.— 1234 2143 2413 4231 4321 3412 3142 1324 Now the hunt is before the bells, there is an extream change made between the two farthest bells from it, which are the 2 and 4, thus.— 1342 3124 3214 2341 2431 4213 4123 1432 1423 4132 4312 3421 3241 2314 2134 1243 1234 The extream change being made, the bells are to move, as be∣fore, observing to make an extream change every time the whole hunt comes before the bells. In this last Twenty-four, the treble is hunted up at the begin∣ning; it may be rang by hunting it down, which is to be done, by making the first a single change, and then hunt it up as before.
With one hunt this Peal may be rang six wayes (viz.) three wayes in hunting it up at the beginning of each Peal, and the other three wayes by hunting it down; the three wayes in hunting it up, differs only in making the extream changes; in one of the three wayes you must make an extream change every time the hunt comes before the bells to lead, as in the Twenty-four changes before set down. Another way is to make an extream eve∣ry time the hunt comes behind. And the third way, is to make an extream every time the hunt comes before and behind the bells. The three wayes in hunting it down, are to be rang by making the ex∣tream changes, as in the three wayes be∣fore; in hunting one bell, there are six wayes to ring this Peal; therefore with the four bells (in makng each of them to hunt) there are four times six wayes to ring it, which makes Twenty-four several wayes. And for the benefit of the Learner, I have set down certain Rules, shewing how to begin any of the aforesaid Peals (viz.) In hunting either the treble or third up, the first change is double; but in hunt∣ing either of them down, the first is single.
In hunting the second or the fourth up, the first change is single; but in hunting either of them down, the first change in each Peal must be double. Doubles and Singles on five Bells. THere is a Peal to be rang on five bells, called Doubles and Singles, wherein are Six-score several changes, sixty of which are double changes, and sixty are single; the double and single changes are so intermixt, that two dou∣ble changes does not at any time come together in the Six-score; neither are two single changes made next to each other in any part of this Peal, but one change is double, and the next single, in which course they are made to the end. Every double change is made between the four foremost bells (i. e.) in treble, second, third, and fourth place. When the whole hunt is hunting up, each single change is made between the whole hunt, and the next bell above it. In hunting down the single changes are made be∣tween the whole hunt, and the next bell below it, the whole hunt being alwayes
one of the two bells which makes every single change, except only when it leads, and then the single change is made in third and fourths places; but the ex∣tream is also a single change, and made (when the whole hunt leads) between the two farthest extream bells from the half hunt; the half hunt is to lie either before or behind the extream bells, when the extream changes are made, of which I shall shew you more anon. In this Peal there is a whole hunt, a half hunt, and three extream Bells; the whole hunt in a direct course does hunt up and down, and lies twice before, and twice behind all the way; every other bell leads twice together throughout the Peal. And when the whole hunt leaves the thirds place, hunting up, then every bell that comes into second and thirds pla∣ces, does lie in each of those places twice together, until the whole hunt comes down again into thirds place, at which time the bell in fourths place lies there twice, and then makes a dodge with the bell in thirds place (unless an extream change is to be made) and so removes directly down before the bells. And
that bell which comes into the tenors place (when the whole hunt leaves that place hunting down) lies still there, un∣til the whole hunt removes up into that place again, except only when the ex∣tream is made behind, and then the bell in fourths place moves into tenors place, and lies there until the whole hunt moves up into that place. With one whole hunt, and half hunt, this Peal may be rang six wayes, in three of which the whole hunt is to be hunted up at the beginning of each Peal, which three ways differs only in making the ex∣tream changes. One way, is to make an extream change every time the half hunt comes before the extream bells, as in the following Six-score. The second way, is to make an extream change every time the half hunt comes behind the extream bells. And the third way, is to make an extream every time, the half hunt comes before and behind the extream bells. In this last way there are six extreams in each Peal, but in the other two ways there are but three extreams in each Peal. The three wayes aforesaid, are to be rang, by hunting up the whole hunt; but it may be rang three wayes more, in hunt∣ing
down the same whole hunt, in which three wayes the extreams are to be made, as I shewed you before. The whole hunt is alwayes to lead when every extream change is made. This Peal I have set down at large, making the treble the whole hunt, the second the half hunt; and an extream change every time the half hunt comes before the extream bells, as in the fol∣lowing changes. I have drawn a Line between the figures at the extream chan∣ges, that next below the Line is the ex∣tream. 12345 21435 24135 42315 42351 24531 24513 42153 41253 14523 14253 41523 45123 54213 54231 45321 45312 54132 51432 15342 15432 51342 53142 35412 35421 53241 53214 35124 31524 13254 13524 31254 32154 23514 23541 32451 32415 23145 21345 12435 — 12453 21543 25143 52413 52431 25341 25314 52134 51234 15324 15234 51324 53124 35214 35241 53421 53412 35142 31542 13452 13542 31452 34152 43512 43521 34251 34215 43125 41325 14235 14325 41235 42135 24315 24351 42531 42513 24153 21453 12543 — 12534 21354 23154 32514 32541 23451 23415 32145 31245 13425 13245 31425 34125 43215 43251 34521 34512 43152 41352 14532 14352 41532 45132 54312 54321 45231 45213 54123 51423 15243 15423 51243 52143 25413 25431 52341 52314 25134 21534 12354 — 12345
This Peal may be rang Six-score se∣veral wayes; there being twenty hunts on five bells (that is—a whole hunt, and half hunt twenty times on five bells, and not one and the same whole hunt and half hunt twice, as I shewed more at large in the plain changes on five bells before set down) and with each hunt, that is, with one whole hunt and half hunt, it may be rang six wayes; so that multiply twenty, (which are the number of hunts) by six, (which are the number of Peals to be rang on each hunt) and it will produce Six-score several wayes to ring it. It may be prick't, or rang Six-score several wayes more, by making the ex∣tream changes when the whole hunt lies behind the bells, but those wayes are never practised; neither do I think it material to say any thing more of them in this place, having only inserted this, to shew the great variety there is in this Peal. It being somewhat difficult to know the true way of beginning each Peal, I have therefore set down certain Rules, shewing how the first changes in each are to be made. In hunting the treble, the third, or the fifth bells up, the first change in each Peal is to be made double.
In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in third and fourths pla∣ces, unless the half hunt lies so, as that the extream is to be made. In hunting the third or fifth down, the first change is to be made single, between the whole hunt, and the next bell be∣low it. In hunting up the second or fourth, the first change in each Peal is single, be∣tween the whole hunt, and the next bell above it. In hunting down the second or fourth, the first change is to be made double. Every double change in all the Peals of Doubles and Singles, is made between the four foremost bells; that is—in treble, second, third and fourths places. Tendring's Six-score on five Bells. IN this Peal are contained Six-score changes, which are Doubles and Sin∣gles, there being sixty double changes in it, and sixty single, which are so inter∣mixt, that two double changes does not come together in any part of the Peal; neither are there 2 single changes at any
time made together, but one change is double, and the next to it is single; in which course the changes are all made to the end of the Peal. Every single change is made between the 2 hindmost bells. There is a whole hunt and half hunt in it. The observation in ringing it, is this: When the whole hunt lies before the bells, and is to hunt up, first it moves up into seconds place, where it lies twice; then into thirds place, where it lies also twice; then into the fourths place, where it lies once; and in the tenors place once: Then it makes a dodge with the bell in fourths place, after which it lies twice be∣hind; then it moves down into fourths place, and makes a dodge with the bell in tenors place, and then moves down into thirds place, where it lies twice, and in the seconds place twice, ane then it leads four times; after which, it hunts again, as before. The course of the other four bells, are exactly the same with that of the whole hunt, in moving up and down, except only when the Bob-changes are made, and then they differ; but after the Bobs are made, their course is the same as before; every bell lies four times toge∣ther before the bells, and twice in the se∣conds
place without any alteration. In this Peal are two sorts of Bobs; one of which is called a double Bob, and the other a single Bob. The Rule for ma∣king the double Bob is this, when the whole hunt is hunting down, and lies in the seconds place, and the half hunt lies behind, then there's a double Bob; that is, two Bob-changes; one of which is made the next change, wherein the whole hunt moves down to lead; where having led four times, there is then an∣other Bob-change to be made, in which the whole hunt moves up into the se∣conds place. The Rule for making the single Bob, is this, when the whole hunt has led four times, and the half hunt lies in thirds place; then the next change following is a single Bob, that is—one Bob-change, in which the whole hunt moves out of the trebles place up into the seconds place, every Bob is a dou∣ble change, and made between the two first, and two last bells, the bell in thirds place lying still when each Bob is made, where it lies four times together, and then moves down; every time the whole hunt comes before the bells, there is ei∣ther a single Bob, or a double Bob made.
At every double Bob, those two bells that do dodge behind at the first Bob-change, continues dodging until the whole hunt moves up, and parts them: And likewise at the single Bob, those 2 bells which do dodge behind at the Bob-change, continue dodging until the whole hunt moves up, and parts them, as in the following changes, where the treble is the whole hunt; the tenor the half hunt, and the first is a Bob-change, being supposed to be the second Bob-change of a double Bob. 12345 21354 21345 23154 23145 32415 32451 34215 34251 43521 43512 45321 45312 54132 54123 51432 51423 15243 15234 12543 12534 21543 21534 25143 25134 52314 52341 53214 53241 35421 35412 34521 34512 43152 43125 41352 41325 14352 14325 13452 13425 31452 31425 34152 34125 43215 43251 42315 42351 24531 24513 25431 25413 52143 52134 51243 51234 15324 15342 13524 13542 31524 31542 35124 35142 53412 53421 54312 54321 45231 45213 42531 42513 24153 24135 21453 21435 12453 12435 14253 14235 41253 41235 42153 42135 24315 24351 23415 23451 32541 32514 35241 35214 53124 53142 51324 51342 15432 15423 14532 14523 41532 41523 45132 45123 54213 54231 52413 52431 25341 25314 23541 23514 32154 32145 31254 31245 13254 13245 12354 12345
This Peal was made out of Grandsire on five bells, the Bob-changes in this, be∣ing the same with those in Grandsire, and made by the same Rule. Paradox on five Bells. THis Peal of Paradox is to be rang on five bells, wherein are Six-score changes, they are Doubles and Singles; that is—one change double, and another single; in which course they are made to the end of the Peal. Every single change is made in second and thirds pla∣ces, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then 'tis made in third and fourths places; but the extream Chan∣ges are (also single) and made be∣tween the two farthest extream bells from the half Hunt; the whole Hunt lies before the bells, when every ex∣tream change is made. Every bell lies four times together before, and four times behind, except only when the ex∣tream changes are made behind. There is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three extream bells; the course of the whole Hunt is this, it being before the bells,
first it moves up into the second and thirds places, then it makes a dodge with the bell in seconds place, and moves out of the thirds place up into fourths, where it lies alwayes twice, then moves up be∣hind, where it lies four times, and then moves down into fourths place, where having lay twice, it hunts down into se∣conds place, and makes a dodge with the bell in thirds place, and then moves down before the bells, where having lay twice, it hunts as before; each of the other bells has the same course (in hunt∣ing up and down) as the whole Hunt until the whole Hunt leads, at which time every bell that comes into seconds place lies there twice together, unless the extream change is to be made in se∣cond and thirds places. In this following Peal, the treble is the whole Hunt, and the second the half Hunt; the extream changes are made, when the half Hunt lies before the ex∣tream bells.

I have drawn a Line between the Figures at the extream changes, that next below each Line is the extream; the first extream is Forty changes from the beginning. This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles on four bells. The half Hunt, and three ex∣tream bells in this Peal, makes the Twen∣ty four changes in a perfect course. There are four changes made in the Twenty-four every time the whole Hunt leads, which coming before the bells six times in the Six-score, and each time lying there four times together, makes six times four changes, which is Twenty four. 'Tis easily made out, if you take every change that is made when the whole Hunt is be∣fore the bells in the Six-score before, and set the changes down by themselves (lea∣ving out the treble) where you will find, that the second, third, fourth and fifth, make the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles, in a perfect course; second is the Hunt, and the extreams are made when the Hunt is before. Paradox may be rang Six-score se∣veral wayes. With one whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it may be rang six wayes,
in three of which the whole Hunt is to be hunted up; and in the other three wayes it is to be hunted down, in which six wayes the extream changes are to be made by the same Rules, and in the same manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score Doubles and Singles on five bells; so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be prick't or rang twenty times six wayes, which makes Six-score. This Peal may be prick't Six-score wayes more, by making the extreams when the whole Hunt lies behind the bells, but that being never practised, I will say no more of it. I have here set down some general Rules for beginning the several Peals of Paradox by the former course (i. e.) in making the extreams when the whole Hunt is before the bells. In hunting the treble up, the first change is double between the four first bells, thus.—12345.21435 In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in third and fourths pla∣ces (thus.—12345.12435) unless the half Hunt lies so, that the extream may be made.
Second up, the first change is single in second and thirds places, thus.—12345.13245. Second down, the first change is double between the four first bells. Third up, the first change is double be∣tween the four first bells. Third down, the first change is single in second and thirds places. Fourth up, the first change is double between the four hindmost bells, thus▪— 12345.13254. Fourth down, the first change is double between the four first bells. Fifth up, the first change is single in second and thirds places. Fifth down, the first change is double between the four hindmost bells. If you observe these Rules aright, to∣gether with my former directions, you may with much ease prick down any Peal of Paradox.
PHOENIX. On five Bells. THis Peal has Six score changes in it, which are Doubles and Singles; the tenor is the whole Hunt, and the fourth the half Hunt. Every bell lies twice before, and four times behind; every single change is made in second and thirds places, and every bell that comes into fourths place, lies there twice together, until the tenor comes be∣hind; at which time, the fourth lying in the seconds place, the next single change is made in third and fourths pla∣ces; but the tenor lying behind, and the fourth in thirds place, then the two next following single changes are in third and fourths places.

What you please. Dou∣bles and Singles on 5 Bells. EVery bell leads four times, and lies behind twice, except when the ex∣tream is made behind, and twice in the seconds place, except when the extream is before; and note, when the treble is before the fourth stroke, the single is in second and third, the next time the sin∣gle is behind; but at other times, the single is in third and fourths places. When any bell leaves leading, the dou∣ble change is on the two first, and two last, and the extreams are made by turns, first behind, then before, and so on to the end, for there are six extreams.

Reading Doubles. On five Bells. IN this Peal are Six-score changes, the treble is a Hunt; and note when treble is in thirds place hunting up, the two foremost bells dodge until it comes into the same place hunting downwards; and alwayes when the treble is going to lead, the four first bells makes the dou∣ble change, if the third be behind; but if it be before, the double is on the two first and two last; every bell lieth twice behind, except when the treble goes to lead, if the third be before; and note, when it is 1, 3, 2, there is a single in se∣cond and thirds places, which is twice, once at the Three-score end, and Six-score end.

Old Doubles. On five Bells. THis Peal call'd Old Doubles, is to be rang on five bells, wherein are Six-score changes, which are all Dou∣bles, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then there is alwayes a single change made. It has a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three extream bells; every bell leads twice together all the way, and lies twice behind, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then the bell behind lies there four times toge∣ther, unless the extream is made behind, and then but twice. Every bell hunts in a perfect course, until the whole Hunt leads, and then the single is to be made, at which time the bell in seconds place lies there twice (unless the extream is made in second and thirds place) and every single change is made in third and fourths places, except the extreams
which are (in this Peal) made by the same rule, and after the same manner, as I shewed before in the Six-score call'd Doubles and Singles on five bells. In making the single changes in third and fourths places, it is observed, that the bell which lies in fourths place (the change next before the single) is hunting up; and in making the single change, it does dodge with the bell in thirds place, and so hunts up behind; and likewise the bell that lies in thirds place (in the change next before the single) is hunt∣ing down, and in making the single it does dodge with the bell in fourths place, and then hunts directly down. In this following Peal, the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and an extream change is alwayes made, when the half Hunt lies before the extream bells next to the whole Hunt; every extream is made be∣tween the two farthest extream bells from the half Hunt, as in these fol∣lowing changes.

This Peal of Old Doubles, is groun∣ded on the Twenty-four changes Dou∣bles and Singles on four bells, which are made in a perfect course herein; every time the whole Hunt leads, there are two changes made in the Twenty-four; the half Hunt, and three extream bells, makes the Twenty-four changes, and every single change in this Peal, is a sin∣gle change in the Twenty-four. This Peal may be rang Six-score se∣veral wayes; with one whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it is to be rang six wayes (i. e.) three wayes in hunting up the whole Hunt at the beginning of the Peal, and the other wayes in hunting it down; in which six wayes, the Extream Changes are to be made by the same rule, and in the same manner, as those in the Six-score Doubles and Singles on five Bells, and Paradox before set down; so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be rang twen∣ty times six wayes, which makes Six-score. In these Six-score wayes, the whole Hunt is before the Bells when every sin∣gle Change is made; but it may be rang Six-score several wayes more, by ma∣king the single Changes when the whole
Hunt lies behind them, which being never practised, I will say no more of it. For the convenience and benefit of the Practitioner, I have set down certain rules, shewing how to begin each Peal of Old Doubles (with any Hunt) by the former course (i. e.) in making the single Changes, when the whole Hunt lies before the Bells, these Rules serving only for moving the whole Hunt at the beginning of each Peal, for it may be hunted either up or down. In hunting either the treble, third, or fifth Bells up, the first change is made be∣tween the four foremost Bells, thus.— 12345:21435. —The treble down, the first change is sin∣gle in third and fourths places, unless the half Hunt lies so, as that the Ex∣tream is to be made. —The third or fifth down, the first change is between the four hindmost Bells, thus.—12345:13254. —The second or fourth up, the first change is between the four hindmost Bells. —The second or fourth down, the first change between the four foremost Bells.
In ringing any of these Peals, where the first change is made between the four hindmost Bells, it must be made at the Back-stroke, otherwise the Bells will cut Compass all the way; every double change is made either between the four foremost, or four hindmost Bells. New Doubles. On five Bells. IN this Peal of New Doubles, there are Six-score Changes, which are all double, except only when the whole Hunt leads, and then there is alwayes a single Change made; it has a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three Extream Bells. The whole Hunt has a perfect course in hunting up and down, and lies twice before, and twice behind. When the whole Hunt leaves the thirds place hunting up, then each Bell that comes into that place, lies there twice, and then moves up behind; and the Bells in tre∣ble and seconds places, does continue dodging from the time that the whole Hunt hunts up out of thirds place, un∣til it comes into that place again hunting down; and that Bell which comes into
thirds place (when the whole Hunt leaves it hunting down, lies there twice, and then moves up behind) and the next Bell that comes into that place, lies there twice also, and then moves down before the Bells. But note, that Bell which lies in the thirds place (in the Change next before the Extream) con∣tinues there, until the whole Hunt hunts up into that place, and then it moves down; when the whole Hunt leads the Bell in seconds place, lies there twice together, and then moves down before the Bells; and every Bell that comes behind, lies there twice, except only in the Change next before, and that next after the whole Hunt leads; every single Change is made in third and fourths pla∣ces, except the Extreams, which are al∣so single Changes, and made between the two hindmost Bells, when the half Hunt lies before the Extream Bells next to the whole Hunt. These directions are only for Ringing this Peal next following; but it may be Rang many other wayes, by making the Extream Changes in other places, of which I shall speak more anon.

This Peal may be Rang Six-score se∣veral wayes. With one whole Hunt, and half Hunt, it may be Rang six wayes; in three of which, the whole Hunt is to be hunted up, and in the other three wayes it is to be hunted down; which six wayes are to be Rang, by making the Extream changes by the same rules, and in the same manner, as in Doubles and Singles on five Bells, Old Doubles, and Para∣dox, before set down; so that with the twenty Hunts, it may be Rang twenty times six wayes, which makes Six-score. This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four Changes, Doubles and Singles on four Bells, the half Hunt and three Ex∣tream Bells makes the Twenty-four Changes in perfect course; and in the same manner, as I shewed you in Para∣dox, and Old Doubles. These following rules shews how to begin any Peal of New Doubles. In hunting either the treble or fourth up, the first change must be double be∣tween the two first, and two last Bells, thus.—12345:21354. In hunting the treble down, the first change is single in third and fourths
places, unless the extream is to be made. —The fourth down, the first change is be∣tween the four first Bells. Second up, first change double between the four hindmost Bells. Second down, the first change is double be∣tween the two first, and two last Bells. Third up, first change double between the four foremost Bells. Third down, first change double between the four hindmost Bells. Fifth up, double between the four first Bells. Fifth down, first change double, two first and two last Bells. Grandsire on five Bells. GRandsire is the best and most ingenious Peal that ever was composed, to be rang on five bells, it having no depen∣dance on the course of any other Peal. There are Sixscore changes in it, in pricking of which, there is the greatest variety of any other Peal whatsoever; for it may be prick't or rang some thousands of wayes. The common way of ringing it, is to make the Bobs and single chan∣ges when the whole Hunt leads, which course
and method I will first set down, and afterward say something of the other wayes in ringing it. It has a whole hunt and half hunt, the changes are all double except two, which are single. The whole hunt has a perfect course in hunting up and down, and lies twice together before, and twice behind all the way; every other bell has the same course as the whole hunt, in moving and hunting up and down; and each bell lead twice together all the way, and lie twice toge∣ther behind, except only at the Bobs. Every Bob-change is made between the two first and two last bells, the bell in thirds place lies still when every Bob-change is made, and then moves down; and every other double change is made between the four bells that stand together (viz.) either the four first, or four last bells. There are two sorts of Bobs, one of which is call'd a single Bob, and the other a double. The Rule for making the single Bob is this — When the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in thirds place, the next is a Bob-change; in ma∣king of which, the whole hunt moves out of the trebles place up into the seconds place hun∣ting up, and the bell which lies behind in the change next before the Bob, makes a dodge with the bell in fourths place, and then lies twice behind; and that bell which did dodge with the bell in tenors place, moves directly down; this is a single Bob, that is, one Bob-change. The Rule for making the double Bob is this—When the whole hunt lies in the se∣conds place hunting down, and the half hunt behind, then there is a double Bob, that is, two
Bob-changes, one of which is made the next change wherein the whole Hunt moves out of the seconds place down before the bells, and the other Bob is made the next change but one to it, in which the whole Hunt moves from before the bells up into the seconds place; the bell which lies in the thirds place when every Bob-change is made, lies there twice, and then moves down. And at every double Bob, the two hindmost bells continue dodging until the whole Hunt moves up into the fourths place, and parts them. Every time the whole Hunt comes before the bells, there is either a single Bob, or double Bob made, which comes by turns, one single, and the next double through∣out the Peal. The greatest variety of this Peal, consists in making the single changes. In this way of Ringing it (with any whole Hunt and half Hunt) the first single change may be made either at the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth Bobs, at the single or double Bobs at pleasure; observing for a constant Rule, that the half Hunt is alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change; for the sin∣gle changes are so contrived, that (in making them) the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant course as at other times. At the single Bob, the single change is made in second and thirds places; and at the double Bob, 'tis made in fourth and fifths pla∣ces, the other three bells lying still in their pla∣ces, whil'st each single change is made; the next change to each single, is a Bob-change; eve∣ry single change is made▪ when the whole hunt
lies before the bells; there being alwayes sixty changes, from the first single change to the se∣cond; if the first single change is made at a single bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob from it; or if the first single change is made at a double bob, the second single change must be made at the third double bob from that where the first was made. This Peal may be rang without making any single change therein, which is done by ma∣king a double change to supply the place of it. There are two of these double changes in each Peal; the first of them may be made at any bob within sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal, and the second is to be made just sixty changes from the first. At a double bob, it may be made at either of the two bob-changes; at the first of them, 'tis made by moving the whole Hunt down, and the bell in thirds place up over two bells at once into the tenors place, thus:—41325:14253. In making it at the second bob change of the double bob, 'tis the same as at the first, only in that the whole Hunt moved down to lead; but in this it must move up from before the bells into the seconds place, as in this change— 12435:21354. The changes next following these, are the same as at other times. At the single bob, 'tis to be made when the whole Hunt lies in the seconds place hunting down; in which place it may be made two wayes, in one of which the bell in thirds place is to be moved up be∣hind, in the same manner as I shewed you at
the double bob: The other way, is to move the bell in tenors place down into the thirds place, thus:—51423:15342. Now the reason wherefore at this place it may be made two wayes, and at each of the double bob changes but one way, is this; At the double bob, the half Hunt lies behind, which cannot be moved into thirds place, for that would put it out of its course; but in the single bob, the half Hunt lying before the bells, and the whole Hunt in seconds place, so that neither of those bells are concerned therein; therefore it may be made either by moving the bell in thirds place up behind, or else by mo∣ving the hindmost bell down into thirds place, both which are to one effect, though different changes; for these changes are so continued, that (in making them) the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to continue their constant course, as at other times. I have here set down this Peal of Grand∣sire, making the treble the whole Hunt, and the tenor the half Hunt, and the first single change is made the sixth bob; that is, the third double bob, which is sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; you may know the single change, by the line drawn between the figures at the single change, that next after the line is the single: Grandsire is most com∣monly rang, as it is here prickt; but it may be rang any other way, according to my directi∣ons before.

lying behind when each single change is made, and the second single change must be made just sixty changes from the first. In all the several Peals of Grandsire by the course aforesaid, the first changes in each Peal must be made by these following Rules. 1, 3 1, 5 1, 3 2, 4 3, 2 3, 5 4, 1 4, 5 5, 1 5, 4 With these ten Hunts, the whole Hunt is to be hunted up at the beginning of each Peal. 1, 2 1, 4 2, 1 2▪ 5 3, 1 3, 4 4, 2 4, 3 5, 2 5, 3 With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is made by hunting the whole Hunt down. These are the twenty Hunts on five bells, which are set down in Page 26. The two Figures which stand together, do represent the whole Hunt and half Hunt; for instance, the uppermost figures are 1, 3; the 1 is the whole Hunt, and the 3 is the half Hunt, and so of the rest. Where the letter B stands by the Hunt, the first change that Hunt makes is a Bob: But with all the other Hunts, the first change is either between the four first, or four last bells; yet the first change in many of them may be made single, as in 1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:2, 1:2, 3:3, 1:3, 5:4, 1:4, 3:4, 5:5, 1:5, 4:
In hunting the treble down, the first change is made between the four hindmost bells; and in hunting the fifth bell up, the first change is made between the four foremost bells. There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire, which is, to make the bobs and single changes when the whole hunt lies be∣hind the bells; but this is not convenient to be practised, therefore I will say no more of it in this place, having only mentioned this, to shew the great variety there is in this Peal. This Peal of Grandsire is to be Rang by another course, viz. to make the bobs when the whole hunt is behind the bells, and the sin∣gle changes, when it lies before them. This is the absolute foundation from whence the excel∣lent Peal of Grandsire bob (on six bells) had its beginning and method, and by practising to prick down this Peal, and by observing the true course and method of the bobs and single changes herein, you may with the grea∣ter ease understand the true course of the bobs and single changes in Grandsire bob on six bells, for the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and the three extream bells (in Grandsire bob on six bells) do make these sixscore changes; eve∣ry time the whole hunt leads in Grandsire bob, there are two changes made in this Peal of Grandsire on five bells: And so consequently, the single changes is Grandsire bob are made by the same rule and method as they are in this Peal. The Rule for making the bobs in this Peal, is this (viz.) when the whole hunt lies in the fourths place hunting up, and the half hunt leads, the next is a double bob: And
when the whole hunt lies in the tenors place, and the half hunt in thirds place, then the next change is a single bob, the bobs are made be∣tween the two first and two last bells, that in thirds place lies still in the bob change, and then moves up. The single changes are made when the whole hunt leads; the first single change (in Ringing it with any whole hunt and half hunt) may be made at any time when the whole hunt leads, within sixty chan∣ges from the beginning of the Peal, accoun∣ting the bells as they stand round at the begin∣ning for one of the sixty changes. The single change that is made the next time the whole hunt leads after a single bob, is made in fourth and fifths places; and that which is made next after a double bob, is made in second and thirds places, the half hunt is alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change. If the first single change is made after a single bob, then the second single change must be made when the whole hunt leads next after the third single bob from that after which the first single was made; and the same is observed, in making them after a double bob: there being alwayes sixty changes from the first to the se∣cond single change in each Peal. This Peal I have here set down, in which I make the treble the whole hunt, the fifth the half hunt, and the first single change is made when the whole hunt comes to lead next after the first single bob: You may know the single change, by the line drawn between the figures; the change next below the line, is the single, as in the fol∣lowing Peal.

At a double bob, it may be made at either of the two bob-changes, by moving the bell which lies in thirds place down under two bells at once into the trebles place: Now suppose it
were to be made the first time the whole hunt lies in the fourths place hunting up in the Peal next before, which is at a double bob, the bells lie thus, 53412; now the treble being the whole hunt must move up behind, and the fourth bell being in thirds place, must move down under two bells at once into the trebles place, thus, 45321; or else it may be made at the next bob-change of the double bob, 53241; here the treble must be moved down into fourths place, and the second bell into tre∣bles place, thus, 25314. It may also be made the change next before the single bob, in which change it may be made two wayes; viz. either by moving the bell in thirds place down into trebles place, as in the changes next before, or else by moving the bell in trebles place up into thirds place; for instance, two changes before the first single bob (as in the Peal before set down) the bells lie thus, 24315; now the change may be made, either by moving the third bell into the trebles place, thus, 32451; or else the bell that leads up into thirds place, thus, 43251; in both which wayes, the whole hunt is to be moved up behind. There are only two of these double changes to be made in each Peal▪ if the first is made at a double bob, then the second must be made at the third double bob from it; or if the first of them is made at a single bob, then the second must be made▪ at the third single bob from that where the first was made, there being alwayes just sity changes from the first of these double changes to the second in each Peal. These double changes are the same which in
Grandsire bob on six bells, are called true changes; those true changes in Grandsire bob being made by the same rule, and in the same manner as these are. In all the Peals of Grandsire, wherein the bobs are made when the whole hunt is behind (according to the Rules next before set down) the first changes in each Peal must be made by these Rules following. 1, 2 1, 5 2, 1 2, 5 3, 1 3, 4 4, 2 4, 3 5, 1 5, 3 With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is made by hunting down the whole Hunt. 1, 3 1, 4 2, 3 2, 4 3, 2 3, 5 4, 1 4, 5 5, 4 5, 2 With these ten Hunts, the first change in each Peal is made by hunting the whole Hunt up. Where the letter B stands next to any hunt, the first change which that hunt makes, is a bob: But with all the other hunts, the first change in each Peal is made double, either be∣tween the four first, or four last bells; yet in many of them, the first change may be made single, as in 1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:2, 3:2, 5:3, 5:4, 3:4, 5:5, 2:5, 3: Before I conclude my directions to this ex∣cellent Peal of Grandsire, I will set down one general Rule for making the single changes in
any Peal (at places differing from any of the former Rules) viz. wheresoever the whhle hunt and half hunt meets together to make a change (which constantly happens every time the whole hunt hunts up, and every time it hunts down in every Peal) the other three bells may lie still in their places, whil'st the whole hunt and half hunt makes the change; which being made, the whole hunt, the half hunt, and the other bells are immediately to proceed in their course; which single change is as effectual, as those which are made by the Rules aforesaid. Observing to make the first single change in any Peal, within sixty changes from the beginning; and the second single change must be made (just sixty changes from the first) between the whole hunt, and half hunt, which two bells will in course lie in the same places where the first single change was made. The Seven-score and four on six Bells. THis Peal containing Seven-score and four changes, is to be Rang on six bells, in which, the treble and tenor are both whole hunts, and the second is the half hunt; the whole hunts do both hunt at one and the same time in a direct course, one up, and the other down; and alwayes when one of them lies be∣fore the bells, the other lies behind them; and when that hunt which lies before the bells, leaves the trebles place hunting up, the other
hunt lying behind, leaves the tenors place hun∣ting down; each hunt lies only twice toge∣ther before the bells, and twice behind throughout the Peal. The second bell is the half hunt in this fol∣lowing Peal, for the second, third, fourth and fifth bells make the twenty four changes here∣in; every time the whole hunts come before and behind the bells, there is one change made in the Twenty-four (which is alwayes once in six changes) the second bell being the hunt on the Twenty-four; so that every time it comes before or behind the extream bells, there is an extream change to be made, which in the following Peal is made between the two far∣thest extream bells from the second. I have only set down part of this Peal, which is suf∣ficient to shew the course and method thereof. 123456 213465 231645 236145 263415 623451 632451 362415 326145 321645 312465 132456 134256 314265 341625 346125 364215 634251 634521 364512 346152 341652 314562 134526 — 143526 413562 431652 436152 463512 643521 643251 463215 436125 431625 413265 143256 142356 412365 421635 At the extream change next before, I have drawn a line between the figures, that next be∣low the line is the extream: The aforesaid Peal may be Rang with any other whole hunt, or half hunt; and also the Twenty-four changes doubles and singles, may  made in the room of the plain Twenty-ur in the aforesaid Peal.
Trebles and Doubles on six Bells. THere are many Peals of Trebles and Doubles to be Rang on six bells, as, Six-score changes, Seven-score and four, Twelve-score, and Seven-hundred and twenty. In each of which Peals, the changes that are made from the time that the whole hunt leaves the trebles place hunting up, until it comes down into that place again, are▪ all made in one and the same manner; so that the only difference in these Peals, consists in making the changes when the whole hunt leads. These Peals are called Trebles and Doubles, because one is a treble change (that is, 3 changes made together, in which all the six bells do change their places, thus, 123456:214365:) and the next is a double change between the 4 bells, in the midst, thus, 241635: And in this course the changes are alwayes made from the time that the whole hunt leaves the trebles place hunting up, until it comes down into the tre∣bles place again; and in Ringing this Peal, 'tis observed, that every bell does hunt in a perfect and direct course, and lie twice together be∣fore, and twice behind, until the whole hunt leads. The manner of Ringing the Seven-score and four, is this; the treble and tenor are both whole hunts, and the second is the half hunt; the first change as a treble change, and the next a double change, as I shewed you be∣fore;
in which course they are made, until the treble leads again, and the tenor lie behind; at which time there's a single change to be made in third and fourths places: But when the half hunt lies next to the treble, then the next single change must be made in fourths and fifths places, as in this following Peal, where I have only set down part of it for an example. 123456 214365 241635 426153 462513 645231 654321 563412 536142 351624 315264 132546 135246 312564 321654 236145 263415 624351 642531 465213 456123 541632 514362 153426 154326 513462 531642 356124 365214 632541 623451 264315 246135 421653 412563 145236 142536 415263 451623 546132 564312 653421 635241 362514 326154 231645 213465 124356 — 124536 215463 251643 526134 562314 653241 This Peal is grounded on the Twenty-four changes doubles and singles, the second, third, fourth and fifth makes the Twenty-four chan∣ges; the second bell is the hunt in the Twen∣ty-four, therefore the extream in the Peal next before, is made between the two farthest ex∣tream bells from it when it lies before them: At the extream changes there's a line drawn between the figures, but the extreams may be made every time the second lies behind the ex∣tream bells; or else, every time it lies before and behind them, in the same manner, as I told you before in my directions to the Twen∣ty-four Doubles and Singles: And this Peal
may be also Rang with any other whole hunts, or half hunts. In the Six-score Trebles and Doubles, the changes are the same as in the Peal next before, until the whole hunt leads, at which time (in this Peal) there is a double change to be made between the four hindmost bells; but when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, then there is a single change to be made, either between the two nearest bells to the half hunt, or else between the two far∣thest bells from it; there are but two single changes in the Peal, and the second single change must be made between those two bells which made the first. In this following, the treble is the whole hunt, and the second the half hunt, and the first single change is made when the bells do lie 124365: which is sixty changes from the beginning of the Peal; after the whole hunt has at first hunted up and down again: I have set down only those changes which are made every time the whole hunt leads. 123456 214365 241635 426153 462513 645231 654321 563412 536142 351624 315264 132546 135264 — 153624 156342 — 165432 164523 146253 142635 — 124365 — 123465 — 132645 136254 — 163524 165342 156432 154623 — 145263 142536 — 124356 — 123456
The course of the Twelve-score, and the Seven-hundred and twenty, are both one and the same; for the Twelve-score changes, are only part of the Seven-hundred and twenty. There's a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and three extream bells in the Seven-hundred and twenty; the changes are all tre∣ble and double (in the same course, as in the Six-score next before set down) until the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, at which time there's a single change to be made in fourth and fifths places: But when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, and the quarter hunt lies next to the half hunt, then there's an extream to be made, which is a single change, and made between the two farthest extream bells from the quarter hunt; and by observing this course, you may prick down, or Ring the Seven-hundred and twenty: But if you would only Ring Twelve-score changes (and then end there, by brin∣ging the bells round) you must make no ex∣tream change at all; for in making every sin∣gle change in fourth and fifths places, the bells will come round in course at the end of Twelve-score changes, if you make no extream change to carry the Peal forward. In the fol∣lowing changes, the treble is the whole hunt, the 2 is the half hunt, the 3 the quarter hunt, and the 4, 5, and 6, are the extream bells. It being not much material to set down this Peal at large, therefore after the treble (which is the whole hunt) has hunted twice up and down, I have put down only the two changes which are made every time the treble leads to the end of the Twelve-score, as follows.
123456 214365 241635 426153 462513 645231 654321 563412 536142 351624 315264 132546 135264 312546 321456 234165 243615 426351 462531 645213 654123 561432 516342 153624 156342 — 165432 164523 — 146253 142635 — 124365 single 124635 — 142365 143256 — 134526 135462 — 153642 156324 — 165234 162543 — 126453 single 126543 — 162453 164235 — 146325 143652 — 134562 135426 153246 152364 — 125634 single 125364 — 152634 156243 — 165423 164532 — 146352 143625 — 134265 132456 — 123546 The last change is 123546: which is at the end of Twelve-score changes; and here you see, that the whole hunt, the half hunt, and quarter hunt, do lie next to each other before the extream bells; therefore the bells may ei∣ther be brought round, by making the single change in the same place, as those next before, are made thus, 123456: or else, if you would proceed forward to the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty, then the next must be an extream change between the fourth and sixth, which are the 2 hindmost bells, thus, 123564: and by observing to make an extream change
behind every time the 1, 2, 3, lie together be∣fore the bells, the bells will come round in course at the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty; at the end of every Three score chan∣ges, there's a single change throughout the Peal, and an extream change at the end of every Twelve-score. This Peal (by the Rules aforesaid) may be Rang with any whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt. In this Peal is contained the Six-score chan∣ges of Old Doubles on five bells, and also the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles on four bells; the half hunt, the quarter hunt, and three extream bells, makes the Six-score chan∣ges of Old Doubles in a perfect course; and the quarter hunt, and three extream bells, do make the Twenty-four changes Doubles and Singles. Every time the whole hunt leads, there are made two changes of the Six-score; and every time the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies next to it, there are two changes made in the Twenty-four. Grandsire Bob. On six Bells. IN this Peal of Grandsire Bob, there are Seven-hundred and twenty changes, in Rin∣ging of which, there is the same course, as in Trebles and Doubles (before set down) until the bob-changes come to be made; this Peal may more properly be called Trebles and Dou∣bles than the former, because all the changes throughout the Seven-hundred and twenty,
are treble and double, except only the two sin∣gle changes: But in Ringing an Eighteen-score (which is half the Seven-hundred and twenty, and a complete Peal of it self) the changes are all treble and double without any single change therein; for you must know, that in any Peal of Grandsire bob, the bells will come round in course at the end of Eigh∣teen-score changes, if you make no single change to carry it on farther to the end of the Seven-hundred and twenty. This Peal has a whole hunt, a half hunt, a quarter hunt, and three extream bells; every bell hunts in a direct course, and lies twice to∣gether before, and twice behind, until the whole hunt leads, and then the four hindmost bells do dodge, that is, they make a double change; in which 'tis alwayes observed, that the two bells which lie in third and fifths pla∣ces (in the change next before the dodge) are hunting down, and in making this double change, each of those bells do dodge with the bell next above it, that is, they move up over one bell, and then each of them moves direct∣ly down; and the two bells that lie in fourth and tenors places in the change next before every dodge, are hunting up, and in making the dodge change, each of those bells do move down under one bell, and then they move up again in their course, as before; the dodge changes in all Peals of Trebles and Doubles, are made in the same manner as these. There are two sorts of bobs in this Peal, viz. a single, and a double bob; the Rule for making the single bob, is this, when the whole
hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in tenors place, and the quarter hunt in fourths place, the next change is a bob; and when the whole hunt leads, and the half hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter hunt in seconds place, then there is a double bob, that is, two bob-chan∣ges; one of which is made the next change, and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads after. The bobs are all double changes, and made in one and the same man∣ner (i. e.) the leading bell, and that in fourths place, do both lie still, whil'st the two bells in second and thirds places, and those in fifth and tenors places make the bob-change; and as soon as 'tis made, the bell in fourths place moves directly down. The half hunt is al∣wayes one of the two hindmost bells which makes every bob-change. In Ringing this Peal, there is a Rule ob∣served, whereby the person that does Ring the quarter hunt, may give notice of the bobs be∣fore they come to be made, without which it were impossible to Ring it; the Rule is this: In the dodge which is made between the four hindmost bells every time the whole hunt leads, if the half hunt and quarter hunt do dodge in fifth and tenors place, then the next time the whole hunt leads, there's a single bob; if they dodge in fourth and thirds pla∣ces, then there's a double bob, that is, two bob-changes, one of which is made the next time the whole hunt leads after the dodge, and the other is made the next time the whole hunt leads after the former is made: He that does Ring the quarter hunt, may give notice of eve∣ry
bob-change, by saying (Bob) when the whole hunt is going to lead, which is a change next before the bob is to be made. There are certain Rules very convenient to be known by all that practise to Ring this Peal; (viz.) he that does Ring the whole hunt, must observe that the bell which he first fol∣lows when he leaves the trebles place hunting up, he must follow the same bell the next time he lies behind; and the second bell which he follows in hunting up, he must also follow the same bell when he next leaves the tenors place hunting down; and likewise, the third bell which he follows in hunting up, he must also follow the same bell when he leaves the fifths place hunting down: For instance, in the first chage of the following Peal, the bells stand thus,  435: here the treble (being the whole hunt) does first follow the second, there∣fore when the treble has hunted up, and lies behind it, follows the second again, as in this change, 5421: And again, the second change of the following Peal, is 241635: here the fourth is the second bell, which the treble follows in hunting up, therefore he follows that bell again the next time he leaves the tenors place hunting down, as in this change, 563412: which course is observed throughout the Peal. And in Ringing any other bell (beside the whole Hunt) 'tis observed, that the next time you lie before the bells after a bob, that bell which you first follow in hunting up, you must also follow the same bell when you lie behind; and the same bell you must first follow every time you hunt up, and every time you lie be∣hind,
until the next bob comes to be made; but if the whole hunt is the second bell which you follow in hunting up, then you must follow the whole Hunt when you lie behind; and the next time you lead, and lie behind, you must follow the former bell as before, until the bobs come to be made; and after the bobs, the course is the same (though you do not follow the same bell) as before. These Rules and Directions before set down, are to be observed in Ringing any Peal of Grandsire bob with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt: An Example I have here set down, wherein the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quarter Hunt, as in these following changes. 123456 214365 241635 426153 462513 645231 654321 563412 536142 351624 315264 132546 135264 312546 321456 234165 243615 426351 462531 645213 654123 561432 516342 153624 156342 513624 531264 352146 325416 234561 243651 426315 462135 641253 614523 165432 — 156423 514632 541362 453126 435216 342561 324651 236415 263145 621354 612534 165243 162534 615243 651423 564132 546312 453621 435261 342516 324156 231465 213645 126354 123645 216354 261534 625143 652413 564231 546321

Here are just Eighteen-score changes already made, and the bells may either be brought round in their places, by making a dodg-change behind (according to the common course, thus, 124365 123456 but to have proceeded forward in the 720, the last should have been a single change in third and fourths places, thus, 124365 123465 the single change being made, all the following changes to the end of the 720 are to be made, by the same rule and course as those before set down, the last change of the 720 being also a single change, and to be made in the same place, and between those two bells which made the former single, thus, 124356 123456 which single change brings the bells round in their right places at the end of the 720. This Peal of Grandsire bob may be Rang with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; but there being some difficulty in be∣ginning many of the Peals, I have therefore set down Directions for beginning each Peal, as follows. 1, 2, 4 1, 2, 5 1, 3, 2 1, 3, 6 1, 4, 6 1, 5, 3 1, 5, 4 1, 6, 3 In Ringing Grandsire bob with any of these eight Hunts, the first chan∣ges in each Peal are to be made in the same manner, as those in the Peal before set down, until the first bob in each Peal comes to be made.
1.2.3 1.2.6 1.3.5 1.4.2 1.4.5 With these five Hunts, the first change in each Peal is a dodge between the four hindmost bells: thus, 123456 124365 Each three figures that stand together next before, do represent a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; for instance, the uppermost figures in the first Column, are 1.2.4. there the treble is the whole Hunt, the second the half Hunt, and the fourth the quar∣ter Hunt, and so of the rest. In making the treble the whole Hunt, the fifth the half Hunt, and the sixth the quarter Hunt; the first change is a dodge between the four hindmost bells, in which the half and quarter Hunt do dodge together in fifth and tenors places, therefore the next time the whole hunt comes before the bells, there's a single bob. In ringing treble, tenor, and fifth, the whole Hunt moves up the first change, thus, 214365, and so on in the common course un∣til it comes next before the bells, at which time there's a single bob. In ringing treble, fourth, and third, the whole Hunt moves up the first change, thus, 214365, and so forward in the common course, until it leads again; at which time there's a bob-change to be made, and another the next time the whole Hunt leads after that, it being a double bob. In ringing treble, third, and fourth, the first
is a dodge-change between the four hindmost bells, in which the half Hunt and quarter Hunt do dodge together in third and fourths places, therefore a double bob is next to be made, one of which bob-changes is the next time the whole Hunt leads, and the other the next following. In ringing treble, fifth, and se∣cond, the first is a bob-change; and the next time the whole Hunt leads, there's another bob-change, it being a double bob. In Ringing treble, sixth, and second, and treble, sixth, and fourth, the first change in each of these two Peals is a bob. 2.4.6 5.3.4 6.1.2 5.3.1 With these four Hunts, the first change is treble, and the next double, thus, 214365, and so on, till the whole Hunt leads. 3.5.2 4.6.2 6.2.1 2.3.5 6.3.5 With these five Hunts, the first change must be made between the four bells in the midst, thus, 132546. In Ringing tenor, treble, and second, there's a single bob the first time the whole Hunt comes before the bells. In all Peals of Grandsire bob, where the first change is either a bob, or a dodge between the four hindmost bells, or else a double change between the four bells in the midst, it must be made at the back-stroke of the bells, other∣wise the Peal would cut compass all the way, that is, every bell would come to lead at the back-stroke. In the Eighteen-score changes before set down, there's a line drawn between the figures
at every bob, the changes next below each line is a bob-change. In the Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire bob, there are two single chan∣ges to be made. The first single change in any Peal is most commonly made as near the end of Eighteen-score changes (from the begin∣ning) as may be, and 'tis the best way, and most convenient: For instance, sometimes it happens that one or more of those persons who do Ring this Peal, may be weary before they have Rang Eighteen-score changes, therefore upon notice given, the single change may be forborn, and then the bells will in course come round at the end of Eighteen-score changes, making a complete Peal; but after the first single change is made, the bells cannot be brought round in course, until the Seven-hun∣dred and twenty are all made. There is great variety in making the single changes in each Peal, which may be made at divers places (viz.) The first single change in any Peal may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first or second double bobs, at which places the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, do alwayes lie together before the bells, and the single change is to be made in third and fourths places. The first single change in any Peal may also be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the first or second single bobs, at which place the whole Hunt and half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the bells; and the quarter Hunt lies behind, therefore it
must be made between the two hindmost bells. Or if the first bob in any Peal is a double bob, then the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third double bob in that Peal, at which place the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the single is made in third and fourths places. Or if the first bob in any Peal is a single bob, then the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, where the whole Hunt and half Hunt do alwayes lie together before the bells, and the quarter Hunt behind, therefore the single change must be made behind. The first single change in any Peal may also be made either at the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places the whole Hunt leads, the half Hunt lies in tenors place, and the quarter Hunt in fourths place, therefore it must be made behind. The first single change in any Peal may al∣so be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first or second double bobs, at which place the whole Hunt, and quarter Hunt do alwayes lie together be∣fore the bells, and the half Hunt in fourths place, therefore the single change must be made in third and fourths places. And in most Peals, the first single change may be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob; and in some Peals, the first single change may be made the second time the whole Hunt leads
after the third double bob (notwithstanding the first bob-change in that Peal is a single bob, as in the Eighteen-score treble, second and fourth before set down) which falls out ac∣cording as the first bob change happens to be made either nearer the beginning of the Peal, or farther from it; for in some Peals, the bells will come round in course the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob. And in many Peals, the bells will come round at the fore-stroke the second time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the third double bob, &c. There are two single changes in every Seven-hundred and twenty, which are alwayes made when the whole Hunt leads, the last single change in every Peal being constantly made just Eighteen-score changes from the first; for making of which, observe these Rules. If the first single change (in any Peal) is made the second time the whole Hunt leads after a double bob, then the second single change must be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first sin∣gle change was made. If the first single change in any Peal is made the second time the whole Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second single change must be made the second time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, accounting from the place where the first single change was made. Or if the first single change is made at a sin∣gle bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob, accounting from
the place where the first single change was made. The second single change in every Peal must be made between those two bells, and in the same place where the first single change was made; and the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, will in course lie in the same places at the second single change, where they lay at the first: either the half Hunt, or quarter Hunt, are alwayes one of the two bells which makes every single change. But there are many other wayes to make the single chan∣ges, viz. to make them between the half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, at any dodge, where those two bells do dodge together next before a bob, &c. of which I need not say any thing more in this place, having already set down all those wayes which are most easie and con∣venient to be practised. In Ringing this Peal of Grandsire bob, (with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quar∣ter Hunt) if there's no single change made within Eighteen-score changes from the be∣ginning of the Peal, the bells will in course come round in their right places, just at the end of Eighteen-score changes. In any Peal of Grandsire bob, where the first is a double change, and made at the back∣stroke, the last change of the Peal (which brings the bells round in their right places) is a treble change, and made at the fore∣stroke. The Seven-hundred and twenty changes of Grandsire Bob may be Rang without making any single change therein, which way of Rin∣ging
it, is call'd Grandsire Bob True: that is, the changes are all true trebles and doubles without any single change therein. There are made two double changes (contrary to the course of all the double changes in the Peal) to supply the place of the two single changes, which two are called True changes; and to be made divers wayes, and at several places. The first true change in any Peal may be made at the first, second, or third double bobs either at the first or second bob-change of each. At the first bob-change of any double bob it may be made, by moving the Bell in fourths place down under two Bells at once into the seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells must make a change at the same time: for Exam∣ple, in the Eighteen-score of treble, second and fourth before set down, at the first bob-change of the first double Bob, the Bells stand thus, 143526. Now the true change is made, by moving the Bell which lies in fourths place down under two Bells at once into seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells are at the same time to make a change thus, 154362. At this place it may be made another way, by moving the hindmost Bell down under two Bells at once into the fourths place, and the two Bells in second and thirds places are at the same time to make a change thus, 134652. At the last Bob-change of each double Bob, it may also be made two wayes; one of which, is to move the Bell in fourths down into the seconds place, and the two hindmost Bells at the same time to make a change, as I shewed you before: But the best and easiest way is to
move the bell which lies in fourths place up over two bells at once into the tenors place, and the two bells in second and thirds places to make a change as at a bob: for instance, at the last bob-change of the first double bob in the Eighteen-score before set down, the figures stand thus, 143652. Now the bell in fourths place must be moved up behind, and the two bells in second and thirds places are to make a change, 134526. The second True change in every Peal must be made just Eighteen-score changes from the first, in making of which, these Rules are to be observed. If the first true change in any Peal is made at the first bob-change of a double bob, then the second true change must be made at the first bob-change of the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first true change is made, but not reckoning that for one of the three: or if the first true change is made at the last bob-change of a double bob, then the second true change must be made at the last bob-change of the third double bob, accounting from the place where the first true change was made, but not recko∣ning that for one of the three. And the second true change in every Peal must be made in the same manner and place as the first; the true and single changes in Grandsire bob, are both to one and the same effect (i. e.) to alter the course of the extream bells; for in making these changes, the whole hunt, half hunt, and quarter hunt are to continue their constant course without vari∣tion, neither of those 3 bells being any other∣wise concerned therein, than at the change which should have been made, if the single or true change had been forborn.
There is another way to Ring this Peal of Grandsire Bob, by a course differing from the former. When the whole Hunt leads, the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter Hunt in fourths place, then the next change is a single bob; and when the whole Hunt leads, and the half Hunt lies in fifths place, and the quarter Hunt in thirds place, then the next change is the first bob-change of a double bob; the bobs and dodge-changes herein are made in the same manner, as those in the for∣mer way: But the bobs herein are called by a Rule differing from the former, viz. when the whole Hunt and half Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the quarter Hunt (ly∣ing in fourths place) dodges with the bell in thirds place, then the second time the whole Hunt comes before the bells (from that place) there is made the first bob-change of a double bob, the second bob-change being made the next time the whole Hunt leads af∣ter. When the whole Hunt and half Hunt do lie together before the bells, and the quar∣ter Hunt (lying in fifths place) dodges with the bell in tenors place, then the second time the whole Hunt leads (from that place) is made a single bob. There are two single changes in the Seven-hundred and twenty, the first single change in any Peal may be made at the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places it must be made between the 2 hindmost bells; or the first single change may be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the first, second, or third single bobs, at which places 'tis alwayes
made between the two hindmost bells. The first single change may also be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the last bob-change of the first, second, or third double bobs, where it must alwayes be made in third and fourths places. But in some few Peals it happens, that the bells will come round at the fore-stroke the next time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, and also after the last bob-change of the third double bob, which falls out according as the first bob-change in each Peal is made, either nearer the begin∣ning, or farther off. The second single change (in every Peal) must be made Eighteen-score changes from the first, in making of which, these Rules must be observed. If the first single change is made at a single bob, then the second single change must be made at the third single bob from the place where the first was made. Or if the first single change is made the next time the whole Hunt leads after a single bob, then the second single change must be made the next time the whole Hunt leads after the third single bob, accounting from the place where the first sin∣gle change was made. And the same Rule is observed in making it after a double bob. The second single change in every Peal must be made in the same place, and between those two bells which made the first single change: But (in Ringing this Peal) if you make no single change, the bells will in course come round at the end of Eighteen-score changes. The way to begin several of these Peals, is as follows.
In Ringing treble, third, and fifth; and se∣cond, third, and fifth; and also third, fifth, and second; the first change is treble, and the next double, and so forward in the common course of trebles and doubles, until the first Bob in each comes to be made. In treble, second and third, the first changes are treble and double in the common course; and the second time the treble leads, there's a double Bob. In treble, tenor and second, the first changes are treble and double in the common course; and the second time the treble leads, there's a single Bob. In treble, second and fifth, the first change is a dodge between the four hindmost Bells; and the second time the treble leads, there's a single Bob. In second, fourth and tenor, the first change is made between the 4 Bells in the midst. In treble, second and fourth, the first change is a dodge behind; and the se∣cond time the treble leads, there's a double Bob. Changes on eight Bells. There are 40320 several changes on 8 bells, which to Ring it is altogether impossible; the greatest Peal that ever was Rang on 8 Bells, is 1680, being only a third part of the chan∣ges on seven Bells, which are to be Rang with a whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt, half quarter Hunt (for so you may term it) and three extream Bells: But the most complete and musical Peal that ever was Rang on eight Bells, is Grandsire Bob, treble, second and fifth, Half-pulls, on 1.2.3.5.6.7. the fourth and the tenor lying behind every change, thus, 123567, 48. which has of late been practised
by the Colledge-Youths, and excellently well performed by them. Grandsire, and Tendring Six-score on eight Bells makes good Musick, 7.4.8. lying behind every change: And a Six-score (four extreams) on the six Bells in the midst, the treble leading all the way, and the tenor lying behind, making a change at first between the 4 and 5, and then proceeds for∣ward in the Six-score, making the second the whole Hunt, and the seventh the half Hunt, it makes excellent Musick; but after the Six-score changes are made, the fourth and fifth must change their places again to bring the Bells round. 35678, 241 12357, 864 12357, 468 12357, 648 12356, 748 34567, 218 45678, 321 12368, 574 The most musical Peals that are commonly Rang on eight Bells, are these Six-scores on five, the other three Bells lying behind every change: For example, the uppermost fig. are 35678, 241. here the 35678, makes the Six-score changes, 3 the whole hunt, and 8 the half Hunt, or any others, and 241. strikes behind every change, in the same order as they now lie, and so of the rest. The three Bells which are to lie behind, must first be hun∣ted up one after the other in order, before any of the Six-score changes are made. The Seven-score and four on the six middle Bells, the tre∣ble leading, and the tenor lying behind every change, makes good Musick. Of Hanging Bells. FIrst, for the Stock, much need not be said, but of placing the Canos or Crown of
the Bell into it, which is called Hanging of a Bell, I shall speak something: First, find out whether the Cannons be upright and true, then raise the Bell up by some Rope tyed to the Can∣nons, and so that the Bell hang level, which you may find, by applying a Plumet to the brim, then fasten a string to the Crown-staple within the Bell, then (a Plumet being tyed to the other end of the string) if the string hang in the midst between the two sides of the Bell whereon the Clapper should strike, the Crown-staple is cast into the Bell true: Now when you have hung the Bell, and let the Gud∣geons in true by Keys (for therein consists the main point of the going of a Bell) then if the Clapper hang in the midst between the two striking sides, and the Stock stand upright, the Bell is well hung. If a Bell have a longer stroke on the one side, than the other, truss up that side which hath the short stroke more, or let the other side down, and put a piece or two of Leather in, according to the stroke; but sometimes the fault of the stroke is in the Sally, which you may remedy, by tying the Fillet (or little Cord about the rim of the Wheel, which causeth the dancing of the Rope) nearer, or farther off the main Spoke; nearer makes a short stroke, farther off the Spoke, a long one. And observe, that the trussing or taking up of a great Bell far into the Stock by a notch, makes the Bell go easier, and lie lighter at hand (that is) when it is set; for the farther the brim of the Bell is from the  of gra∣vity, the heavier it is: ow the  of gra∣vity
is a supposed line drawn through the Stock from one Gudgeon to the other; but note, if you truss a Bell up, that the Crown-staple be much above the Gudgeons, you must fasten a false Eye to the Crown-staple, and to this false Eye hang the Clapper, otherwise it will not strike so freely: Now small Bells must be trussed up short, for else the Bell hanging low, and fetching a great Compass in the swing, and ha∣ving but little Compass in the brim, the Clap∣per keeps along by the side of the Bell, and gives no blow at all; but being hung short, the Bell fetches a quick and short Compass, equal to the bigness of the brim, and the Clap∣per strikes well. Now for the tempering of the Gudgeons, I leave it to the judgment of the Workman; but a word or two of the polishing of it. After it is filed, or turned exactly round, take two pieces of Oak, and oyl one side of each, and strew fine Sand thereon, and clap them in a Smiths Vice, with the round of the Gudgeon between, then turn it about, until you think it is sufficiently polished, then oyl the sides of the pieces of Oak wherein there is no Sand, and so clap them in a Vice, with the Gudgeon be∣tween, as before, then turn it round, and it will polish the Gudgeon wonderful smooth; and if the Brasses are likewise well polished, the Bell will go as well at the first, as ever: Now by the neglect of this, the roughness of the Gudgeon will wear the Brasses so unequally, that the Bell will never go smooth and steddy. Now I would advise all Bell hangers to hang Bells with bolts of Iron to come from
the Cannons through the Stock, and to fasten them with Keys at the top of the Stock, and not with plates nailed on the sides; for they are mighty inconvenient to fasten a bell that is loose in the Stock, or to alter the stroke. As for the Rowle, let it not be without, nor within the hollow of the side of the Wheel; nor above, nor below the hollow at the bot∣tom of the Wheel. Now the bigger a Wheel is, if the Frame will permit, the bell will go the better; when the wheel is new, nail Stays from the Stock to each Spoke, to keep it from warping. 'Tis very convenient (if the Frame will permit) to fasten a piece of Timber about half a foot long on the end of the main Spoke at the top of the Wheel (whereon the end of the bell-rope is fastned) with a notch on the end of it; so at the setting of the bell, the Rope will hit into that notch from the Rowle, and this will make the bell lie easier at hand when it is set, and flie better. FINIS.
