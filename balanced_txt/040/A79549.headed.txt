CHRONOSTICHON Decollationis CAROLI Regis, &c▪ tricesimo die Janūarii, secunda hora Pomeri∣diana, Anno Dom. MDCXLVIII. Ter Deno IanI Labens ReX SoLe CaDente CaroL Vs eXVtVs SoLIo SCeptroqVe SeCVre. CHARLS!—ah forbeare, forbeare! lest Mortals prize His Name too dearly; and Idolatrize. His Name! Our Losse! Thrice cursed and forlorne Be that Black Night, which usher'd in this Morne! CHARLS our Dread-Soveraigne—hold! lest Out-law'd Sense Bribe, and seduce tame Reason to dispense With those Celestial Powers; and distrust Heav'n can Beholde such Treason, and prove Just. CHARLS our Dread-Soveraign's murther'd!—Tremble! and View what Convulsions Shoulder-shake this Land. Court, Cittie, Countrie, nay three Kingdoms runne To their last Stage, and Set with Him their Sunne. CHARLS our Dread-Soveraign's murther'd at His Gate! Fell Feinds! dire Hydra's of a Stiff-neck't-State! Strange Bodie-Politicke! whose Members spread, And, Monster-like, swell bigger then their HEAD. CHARLS of Great Britaine! Hee who was the knowne King of three Realms, lie's murther'd in his Owne. Hee! Hee! who liv'd, and Faith's Defender stood, Die'd here to re-Baptize it in His Blood. No more, no more. Fame's Trumpe shall Eccho all The Rest in dreadful Thunder. Such a Fall Great Christendome ne're Pattern'd; and 'twas strange Earth's Center reel'd not at this dismal Change. The Blow struck Britaine blinde; each well-set Limbe By Dislocation was lop't off in HIM. Though Shee yet live's, Shee live's but to condole Three Bleeding Bodies left without a Soule. RELIGION put's on Black. Sad LOYALTIE Blushe's and Mourn's to see bright-Majestie Butcher'd by such Assassinates; nay both 'Gainst GOD, 'gainst LAW, ALLEGIANCE, and their OATH. Farewell sad Isle! Farewell! Thy fatal Glory Is Summ'd, Cast up, and Cancell'd in this Story. Aprill 30 1649
