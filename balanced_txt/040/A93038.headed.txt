THE SPEECH OF Colonel SHAPCOTT. Knight for Devonshire. Being Spoken on the 30. of Octob. in the Parlia∣ment House, in behalf of K. Charls the second. M. SPEAKER, THe Gentleman which hath spoken last, did make a motion to this House, that we should establish these three Kingdoms up M. Whit¦lock. on the present Protector and his Heirs; and that in respect of his great Deservings, and as a Reward for his Faithful Service, which will be but very short of his Merits. Truly M. Speaker, If to undo three Kingdoms be meritorious, I must needs say he deserveth far above any; or if to violate the Laws and Freedoms of the Nation by Imposing new Laws upon us, viz. A meer Spanish Inquisition, substituted under another name, where∣by to sweep away our Orthodox Clergie, and to set up in their rooms Anabaptistical persons; I say, if by Imposing Taxes of sundry kinds, being very burdensome and insupportable, and that without any cause or reason, but that of State, and not the State of the Na∣tion neither, but of his own usurping Government and Tyranie over us and our Liberties: or, if his creating a Court to destroy the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, contrary to the Laws of the Nation, under the cloak and colour for the relief of poor Prisoners; if these be merits for which he deserveth three Kingdoms at once to be given him and his Posterity, then let him have it: But if we must needs have a King again, why not he whose unquestionable Right it is? What hath he done to be excluded and dispossest of his undubi∣table Right? Or what mean we thereby? unless we intend to perpe∣tuate the Curse of God upon us and our posterity, by giving away what is not ours to give, and by that Act owning all the Murthers, Perjuries, and Treasons of this Man; and consequently entl the Curse of God upon us and the whole NATION. FINIS.
