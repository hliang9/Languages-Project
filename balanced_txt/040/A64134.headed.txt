TOLERATION Tolerated: OR, A late Learned Bishops Opinion concerning Toleration of Religion With some brief Observations thereon. READER, I Here present thee with the Opinion of a Dead Bishop Taylor in  Pro∣p, p. 213 Sect. 16.  ueion , Whether it be  w∣ a Prince to give Toleration to several Religions. Bishop, since the iving are Untoward, and will not Speak; and indeed, should all Mn be silent, not only the Dead, but the very Stones would speak, in such a just and Righ∣teous Cause as is that of His Majesty's: But I will not  detain thee, only desire thee to observe with me, the great Difference  One who had no other I was to serve, but these of Truth and Christianity, and these whom  justly suspected to have a great many little private and particular ends of their Own. First, 'TIS a great Fault that Men do call the several Sects of Christians, by the Names of several Religions. The Religion of JESUS CHRIST is the Form of sound Doctrine and wholesome Words, which is set down in Scripture indefinitely; actually conveyed to us by plain Places, and separated as for the Que∣stion of Necessary or not Necessary, by the Symbol of the Apostles. Those Impertinen∣cies which the W and Vty of some Men, the Pevishness and Mrseness of others, have Commenced, which their Interest have promoted; which serve not Truth so much as their own Ends, are far from being distinct Religions; for matters of Opinions are no part of the Worship of God, nor in Order to it, but as they promote Obedience to his Commandments; and when they contribute towards it, are in that Proportion, as they contribute Parts and Actions, and minute particulars of that Religion they do or pretend to serve. And such are all the Sects and Pretences of Christians, but Pieces and Mintes of Christianity, if they do serve the Great End, as every Man for his own Sect and Interest, believes for his share it doth. Secondly, TOLERATION hath a dou∣ble Sence or Purpose; for sometimes by it, Men understand a publick Licence and Exer∣cise of a Sect; sometimes it is only an In∣dempnity of the Persons, privately to Con∣vene, and to Opine as they see Cause, and as they mean to answer to God. Both these are very much to the same Purpose, unless some Persons we are bound to Satis∣fie be scandalized, and then the Prince is bound to do, as he is bound to Satisfie. To God it is all one; for Abstracting from the Offence of Persons, which is to be con∣sidered, just as our Obligation is to content the Persons; it is all one, whether we in∣dulge to them to meet publickly or private∣ly to do Actions of Religion, concerning which, we are not perswaded that they are truly Holy. To God it is just one to be in the Dark and in the Light, the thing is the same; only the Circumstance of publick and
private, which cannot be concerned in any thing; nor can it concern any thing but Matter of Scandal, and Relation to the Minds and Fantasies of certain Persons. Thirdly, So that to Tolerate, is not to Persecute. And the Question, Whether the Prince may Tolerate divers Perswasions, is no more, than Whether he may lawfully Perse∣cute any Man for not being of his Opinion. Now in this Case, He is just so to Tolerate Diversity of Perswasions, as he is to Tole∣rate publick Actions; for no Opinion is Ju∣, nor no Person Punishable but for a Sin; and if his Opinion by reason of its Managing, or its Effects be a Sin in it self, or becomes a Sin to the Person, then as he is to do towards other Sins, so to that O∣pinion, or Man so Opining. But to believe so or not so, when there is no more but meer believing, is not in his Power to en∣joyn, therefore not to punish: And it is not only lawful to Tolerate disagreeing Perswasi∣ons, but the Authority of God only is com∣petent to take Notice of it, and ifallile to Determinate it, and fit to Judge; and therefore no Hn no Authority is suffici∣ent to do all those things, which can justifie the Inflicting Temporal Punishments upon such as do not Conform in their Perswasions, to a Rule or Authority, which is not only fallible, but supposed by the disagreeing Persons to be actually deceived. Fourthly, But I consider in the Toleration of a differing Opinion; Religion is not pro∣perly and immediately concerned, so as in any Degree to be indangered: For it may be safe in Diversity of Perswasions, and it's also a part of Christian Religions that the Liberty of mens Consciences should be pre∣served in all things, where God hath not set a Limit, and made a Restraint; that the Soul of Man should be free, and acknow∣ledge no Master but Jesus Christ; that Mat∣ters Spiritual, should not be restrained by Punishments Corporal; that the same Meek∣ness and Charity, should be preserved in the Promotion of Christianity, that gave it Foundation, and Increment, and Firmness, in its first Publication; that Conclusions should not be more Dogmatical, than the vertual Resolution and Efficacy of the Pre∣mises; and that the Persons should not be more certainly Condemned, than their Opi∣nions Confuted; and lastly, that the Infir∣mities of Men, and Difficulties of Things, should be both put in Ballance, to make A∣batement in the Definitive Sentence against Mens Persons. But then, because Toleration of Opinions is not properly a Question of Religion, it may be a Question of Policy: And although a Man may be a good Chri∣stian, though he believe an Error not Fun∣damental, and not directly or evidently Im∣pious; yet his Opinion may accidentally di∣sturb the publick Peace, through the Over-activeness of the Person, and Confidence of their Belief, and the Opinion of its Appen∣dent Necessity; and therefore Toleration of differing Perswasions in these Cases is to be considered upon Political Grounds; and is just so to be permitted or denied, as the Opi∣nions or Tolerations of them may conflit with the publick and necessary Ends of Govern∣ment. Only this: As Christian Princes must look to the Interest of their Government, so especially must they look to the Interests of Christianity, and not call every Redargation or modest Discovery of an Established Error, by the Name of the Disturbance of the Peace. For it is very like, that the Peevishness and Impatience of Contradiction in the Gover∣nours, may break the Peace: Let them re∣member the Gentleness of Christianity, and the Liberty of Consciences which ought to be preserved; and let them do Justice to the Persons, whoever they are, that are peevish, provided no Man's Person be over-orn by Prejudice: For if it be necessary for all Men to subscribe to the present Established Religi∣on, by the same Reason, at another time a man may be bound to subscribe to the Contradi∣ctory, and so to all the Religions in the World: And they only who by their too much Confi∣dence, intitle God to all their Fancies, and make them to be Questions of Religion, and Evidences for Heaven, or Consignations to Hell, they only think this Doctrine Unrea∣sonable; and they are the Men that first disturb the Churches Peace, and then think there is no appeasing the Tumult, but by get∣ting
the Victory; but they that consider things wisely, understand, that since Salvati∣on and Damnation depends not upon Imper∣tinencies, and yet that Peace and Publick Tranquility may; the Prince in this case is to seek how to secure the Government, and the Issues and Intentions of that, while there is in these cases directly no Insecurity to Religion, unless by the accidental Uncharitableness of them that Dispute. Which Uncharitable∣ness is also much prevented when the Publick Peace is secured; and no Person is on either side ingaged upon Revenge, or troubled with Disgrace, or vexed with Punishments by any Decretory Sentence against him. It was a Wise saying of a Statesman (Thu∣anus I mean) Hereiei qui pce data sationi∣bus Sduntur, Persecutie uni centra Rempublicam. If you Persecute Hereticks or Discrepants, they Unite themselves as to a Common Defence: If you permit them, they divide themselves upon Private Itrel, and the rather, if this Interest was the Ingredient of the Opinion. Fifthly, The sum is this, It concerns the Duty of a Prince, because it concerns the Ho∣nour of God, that all Vices, and every part of -life, be Discountenanced and Restrained, and therefore in Relation to that, Opinions are to be dealt with; for the Understanding being to direct the Will, and Opinions to guide our Practices, they are Considerable only as they teach Impiety and Vice, as they either Dishonour God, or Disobey Him. Now all such Doctrines are to be condemned; but for the Persons Preaching such Doctrine, if they neither justifie nor approve the pre∣tended Consequences, which are certainly Impious, they are to be separated from the Consideration, but if they know such Conse∣quences, and allow them, or if they do not stay till the Doctrines produce Impiety, but take Sin before hand, and manage them Im∣piously in any sence; or if either themselves or their Doctrine do Really, and without Colour or feigned Pretence, dusturb the Pub∣lick Peace and Just Intrests, they are not to be suffered. In all other Cases 'tis not only Lawful to permit them, but it is also necessa∣ry, that Princes, and all in Authority, should Persecute Discrepant Opinions. And in such Cases, wherein Persons not otherwise incom∣petent, are bound to reprove an Error (as they are in many.) In all these, if the Prince make restraint, he hinders men from doing their Duty, and from Obeying the the Laws of Jesus Christ. [so for that Learned Bishop] HEre this Learned and great Man (whom I think I may safely pronounce one of the greatest Ornaments which the English Church or Nton ever had) does not in the least Scru∣ple or Object against His Majesty's Dispensing Power, in Tolerating differing Opinions in Religion; and sith that Religion is not pro∣perly concerned in the question. so as in any degree to be indgered; and that it may be safe in diversity of Perswasions, and that it is rather a question of Policy then Religion: Nay, he is so r from saying the Prince may Tolerate, that he ith he , and leaves it not in his choice or power to Choose, and very fairly and ndidly seems rightly to state and determine the present Controversies, in giving to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God, the things that are God's. He sets the Prince on his Throne, and makes it his Pro∣vince to look after Peace, and to take such Measures which may cure the Government, and puts it out of his Power to be concern'd with Men's Consciences. This he very justly leaves to the Managery and Conduct of the Great God; And how far His Majesty's Judgment does quadrate with this Great Man's, I shall here briefly set down. For, Coming to the Crown of his Ancestors, he presently found himself to be the Head of a divided Body; and that all his Subjects were a Disturbed and Contending People, divided into many differing Sects and Factions; and that having had several Educations, they had several Consciencess, he found also every Sect and Party fiercely carrying on their own little particular Intrests; and like Sea-men, every one praying for a Wind to carry their own Vessel out of the Heaven, though the same Wind kept their Neighbours Vessel in the Port or it nay be sunk or overturn'd it: These things he wisely considered, and thought th he had as good be a Soveraign Shepherd, a Soveraign King over such a People; therefore
ade it his business to look into the Causes of such great Disorder, and found that their Feuds and Animosities were about the things of another World; about Truth and Falshood, Heaven and Hell: And should a People be∣lieving in such things be disturbed in their Methods, which they thought most suitable, and proper to obtain the one, or avoid the other, He thought (and that with great reason) His Kingdom here would be very Troublesome and Uneasie; therefore seeing them all Fierce and Eger, and that they would all be Judges in their own Cause, He undertook to decide their Differences, and to judge for them, not as to matter of Truth, but as to matter of Peace; and like a Wise Chymist, seeing their Differences principal∣ly rose from the Mixture and Confusion of things of a Heterogenial Nature, he sepa∣rated the one from the other, the Spiritual things from the Temporal; left the Spiritual to God and themselves, to whom they most properly belong; and took the Temporal as his just Right, and due to Himself The Case stands thus, His Majesty having in a manner wronght a Miracle to Appease his People, viz. To make the Winds blow from all Corners at once, that all their Respective Vessels may Sail together, and none may ever wax a Wind to Lanch out at his pleasure, One would think they should all be satisfied; but we find they are not: And indeed, if we con∣sider things more narrowly, we cannot in Reason expect they should; for things being but in their Formation and growing, if we pull the Fruit before it be ripe, we shall find it have but a Crude and Unsavoury Taste: The Truth is, there has been a Disease a a long time in the Government, and now it comes to be Canvass'd into, and searched, the pain in Curing makes some men love the Disease better than the Remedy; and rather than to be troubled with Dust and Rubish, and to have a little Noise about their Ears, they had rather have an old rotten House which daily threatens to fall on their Heads) hen to have a New One founded on a Rock, tich the Rains and the Winds, the Wit of in, or Malice of the Devil, shall be never e to pull down. POSTSCRIPT READER, COnscience, which has been long last by some Gentlemen, being lately found in a Paper of Reasons I have just now Read (which may be call'd Conscientia Rediviva) I dare now let thee know, that the real cause of my Publishing this Paper was my Conscience. I think really in my Conscience, that His Majesty is hearty and sincere in what he proposes, and designs nothing but the Good of all His Subjects in general; and that it is the Duty of every Man to Contribute something towards making such a Settlement as he desires: And I think I have very good Rea∣son for this my Conscience; and so I think might all others, would they but consider things impar∣tially. And since I am got upon the business of Conscience, I find there are several Conscien∣ces in the Nation: There is His Majesties Con∣science, the Bishops Conscience, and the Con∣sciences of all the several Sects and Divisions of Christians amongst us. Now I shall not Exa∣mine how Unconscionable some of these Consci∣ences may be, nor how they came by such their differing Consciences, but how (if possible) they may all be satisfied. Then in the first place, 'Tis but a point of good Manners to let His Ma∣jesty's Conscience be first satisfied; nay 'tis a point of Prudence too: And if men would but be wise and consider things as they ought, and had really a mind that their Consciences should be satisfied, they would begin here first, and so re∣concile their Duty and Intrest; for in letting His Majesty to have His Conscience, they really se∣cure their own; for 'tis His Majesty's Consci∣ence, that all Consciences should be satisfied, and that none shall be disturbed in any Way or Method they shall choose to obtain Eternal Life, or secure a Mansion in another Would: But then it is not His Conscience, that any should have the power to Disturb or Ruine their Innocent Neighbours, or be Indulged in a Liberty to choose what Irregular Methods they please in obtaining a Possession in this; and this some Unconsciona∣ble Men know, and are very much afraid of; and 'tis His Majesty's Justice they dread, more then his Perswasion; and they could willingly Tolerate the one, so they might be Exempted from the other.
