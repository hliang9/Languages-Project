TO THE READER. THe meanes haue been ve∣rie manifolde in all ages (moste louing Reader) which Aucthorie by rea∣son hath established in the variable, yet orderlie go∣uernments of States and people for the holdinge them in that most louyng and memberlike duetie which one part oweth vnto others, & euerie of them to the conseruation of the whole bodie in best estate. Among which, this hath had his special place: that in the common and still continuing, commerce and in∣terchangeable traffique, passing between man & man, Countrie and Countrie, each hath beene limited to others reasonable liking, by a due obseruation of such assise in the matter of true weight and measure, as by generall consent hath been commended to perticuler practise. Now albeit, that reason it selfe may in this be∣halfe, seem a sufficient schoole mistresse to euerie man not degenerate. Yet when for the needfull vse of this equitie, the Aucthor both of reason and holie religi∣on, shall commend and commaund it to be carefullie kept of all such as professe themselues to be his people (and that vnder the penaltie of most fearefull execra∣tions,
to the violaters of the same) how ought euerie Christian to bee carried with a conscience of duetie herein: vpon which no doubt, the most lawfull and wholsome constitutions of this my natiue country of England were first founded, & stil do stand built. And therfore presenteth vnto euerie true natural and loyal subiect of the same (euen as he oweth obediēce to his most dread souereigne, not so much for feare as con∣science sake) a plaine path truly tending to this kinde of iustice, which many alwaies seeking to themselues, doth sildome practise towards others, for the auoy∣ding of whose common, though oftentimes most vn∣true excuse herein (in alledging their ignorance of the lawes, to be the lack of their lawful obedience) I haue drawne togither such Acts, Statutes, and ordinances, as hauing been ordeined and vsed in sundry Kinges Reignes, and now allowed by the Honourable in au∣thoritie: most apt and proper for the warranting of all lawfull Assise both in weight and measure, which are to be vsed at this day, and within this Realme: especi∣ally such as concerne the Bakers, Brewers, and Inhol∣ders directions. The not obseruing whereof vpon so manifest & plain a publishing, what shal it els but note vnto vs the men of worst marke, whether we respect their conscience towards God, or their verteous con∣uersation in a Christian common wealth. And if all lawes established by lawfull authoritie (not repug∣ning the lawes of God) are to be imbraced by Chri∣stian subiects in a conscionable obedience: by what excuse then do they thinke to winde out from the de∣sert of such disobedience as directly contrarieth both Gods and mans lawes at once: of which nature these
are, that command the true obseruation of weight and measure betweene man and man. In the booke of Le∣uiticus thus we read. You shall not doo vniustly,Leuit. 19. v. 3. in iudge∣ment, in line, weight or measure, you shall haue iust Ballances & true Weights. In the book of Deu. thus. Thou shalt not haue in thy bag two maner of weights a great and a small,Deut. 25. v. 18. nei∣ther shalt thou haue in thy house diuers measures a great and a small but thou shalt haue a right and a iust weight, a perfect and a iust measure shalt thou haue. Again in the Prouerbs, False Ballaunces are an abhomination vnto the Lord,Pro. 11. v. 1. but a p rfect weight pleaseth him. Also in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, thus it is written:1. Thes. 4. v. 6. Let no man defraud his brother in any thing (as euerie one doeth that vseth false weight or measure,) for the Lord is a reuenger of such things. By all which places & many others that might be cited out of sacred scriptures, it appeareth how spe∣cially this vprightnes in the vse of weight and measure hath euer bin enioyned by God himselfe, for a conti∣nuall practise among his people. And therefore most shamelesse are they before men, and no lesse desperate in dispising the reuenging hand of God: who (besides the penalties prouided by ciuil authoritie for the hol∣ding them in awe) dare goe on in so manifest con∣tempt of his so fearfull threats. Leauing therfore these dispisers, to the disposing hand of the Almighty, either in mercy to amend them, or in iustice to condemne them. I commend this litle Pamphlet (shrowded vnder Gods and my Countries lawes, to the rea∣ding, and regarding of the common) yet more con∣scionable sort of subiects in the same. As vnto whose vsuall trades (standing for the most part vpon weight and measure,) the practise therof most properly apper∣teineth,
and for whose sakes I haue satisfied my well meaning, in deliuering them the truth rather homely then handsomely. Like as their following the same, ought to be in a plaine true dealing, and not in a craftie subtill deceiuing, which being the fruit that I hope will ensue my poore paines taking herein (as a well pleasing taste both to God and man) I will onlie content my selfe with expectation of such rewarde, committing thee (good Reader) to the conduct of that spirite that is only able and alwaies readie to pre∣pare thee for euerie good duetie, and to performe the same in thee, according to thy proper place and cal∣ling.

Allowance to Bakers. FIrst it is to be remembred, that the foresaide Assise of all sortes of bread, being many yeares since established by lawe, for the good of this Common wealth. At what time all manner of Fuell and other necessaries néedfull for the misterie of Bakers were farre better cheap, then now they are: as may plainely appeare by the Bakers allowaunces, for their charges in the batche of a quarter of wheate, set downe by the olde sise bookes, not amounting aboue the value of tenne pence. It is therfore berie néedfull, that all manner of officers ha∣uing to deale therein, shoulde haue due regarde thereunto: In yéelding the saide Bakers such reasonable consideration and allowaunces, for and towardes their costs and charges, in baking their breads, as is agreeable vnto equitie and good consience: and may likewise answere vnto the highnes of pri∣ces which thinges now beare: whereby they may continue their saide misteries, with a due obseruation of the true Assise according to the lawes in that behalfe prouided.
And further more if their be any manner of Parson or Par¦sons which shall by any false wayes, or meanes sell any meale vnto the Queenes subiects either by mixing of it deceitefully, or mustie and corrupted meale, which may be to the hurt or infection of mans body: orels by any false slight or any deceat∣full waies or meanes, by false waight or measure, and so de∣ceaue the subiects: For the first offence hee shalbe greeuously punnished, the second offence he shall lose his meale, the third offence he shal suffer the iudgement of the Pillowrie, and the fowerth time he shall foresweare the Towne wherin he dwelleth.
Auncient lawes and good ordinances set downe aswell for Bakers, in making, Sising and selling of all sortes of lawful breads, which by the lawes are ven∣dable vnto her Maiestis subiects in the com∣mon wealth: as also for Inholders, Ʋittulers, and other persons retailing the same, ratified and allowed by her maiesties most honorable priuy counsell, as heereafter followeth. FIrste, that no manner of person or per¦sons shal kéepe a common Bakehouse, in Cities and corporate Townes,Bakers to be apprentized, but such persons as haue béene aprentized vnto the same misterie, or brought vp therein for the more space of seauen yeares, or else otherwise, skilfull in the good making and true sising of all sortes of bread, and shall put his owne proper marke and seale vpon all sortes of his mans bread, which he or they shall make and sell as before is mentioned. Item, that no Baker or other persons, doe make, bake,Lawful breads to be made and solde. vtter and sel, any kindes or sortes of bread, in the common-wealth: but such which the Statutes and auncient ordinaun∣ces of this Realme do allowe them to bake, and sell. That is to saye, they maye bake, and sell Simnell bread, wastell, white, wheaton, housholde, and Horsebreades, and none other kindes of bread to put to sale vnto her Maiesties subiects. Item, they must make and bake farthing white bread,What sortes of bread are to be made. halfe peny white, peny white, halfe-peny wheaton, peny whea∣ton bread, peny housholde, and two peny housholde loues, and none of greater Sise, vpon paine of forfeiture vnto poore people all such greate bread which they or any of them shall make to sel of greater Sise, (the time of Christmas alwaies excepted). Item, they shall not vtter and sell to any Inholder or Vic∣tuler

Item, that no bakers or other person or persons, shal at any time or times hereafter, make, vtter or sel, by retaile, within or without their houses,Vnlawfull breads for∣bidden. vnto any the Quéenes subiects any spice Cakes, Bunnes, Biskets, or other spice breads (beeing bread out of Sise and not by lawe allowed) excepte it be at Burialls or vpon the Friday before Easter, or at Christmas: vpon paine of forfeiture of al such spice breades to the poore. Item, whereas there are, in Cities or corporate Townes, common Bakers, vsing the mistery of baking, there and with∣in the same Townes the foreine Bakers, which come into the market with their breades to be solde, shall not onely bringe with them,Forren bakers to keep greater sise then the townes men. such kindes of sortes of Sised breades, as the lawe and ordinaunces do alowe, to be made and solde as aforesaide: but also shall kéepe and obserue this order, in the weight of their breades, as hereafter followeth: because the saide forrei∣ners do not beare and pay, within the same Cities or Towns, such Scotte and Lotte, as the Bakers of the same townes do. First, the Forreiners halfe peny white Loues shal wey half an ounce more in euery Lofe, then the Bakers of the same townes halfe peny white Loues doe. Item, their peny white Loues shall wey, one ounce more in euery Lofe then the Bakers of the same townes peny white Loues doe. Item, their halfe peny wheaton Loues, shall wey one ounce more in euery Lofe, then the Bakers of the same townes halfe peny wheaton Loues doe.

Item, their two peny housholde Loues, shall weye foure ounces more in euery Lofe, then the Bakers of the same townes, two peny houshold Loues doe. Prouided alwaies, that the Clerke of the market of her Maiesties houshold, his deputies or deputie, Maiors, Bailifes and other Officers, of Cities, Corporat towns & liberties, shal looke vnto, haue diligent care and respecte vnto the due per∣formaunce, and execution of these Articles, and shall and may from time, to time, fréely giue and distribute,Penaltie. al such vnlawfull breades as shalbe hereafter made and put to sale being contra∣rie to these Articles (before mentioned) vnto poore prisoners or any other poore people, willing & requiring al Iustices of peace, Constables, Baylifes, and all other Officers, to be ayding, as∣sisting and helping, al the foresaid Officers in the due executiō hereof, as they will answere to the contrarie at their perils. Note also, that this Assise of all sortes of bread,Assise of bread after Troy weight. ought al∣waies to bee approued by the Troye weight, deriued from the graines of wheate: whereof two graines, taken in the middest of the eare, maketh the xvi. parte of a Sterling peny: iiij. graines maketh the eight parte of a peny Sterling: eight graines make the fourth parte of a peny Sterling, and two and thirtie graines of wheate, make the whole Sterling peny. Twentie of which pence, make the ounce Troy, xv. d. thrée quarters of an ounce, x. d. halfe an ounce, fiue pence a quarter of an ounce, & ij. d. ob. halfe a quarter of an ounce, which weight being named Troy weight, serueth only to wey, Bread, Gold,Ounce Troye.

weight serueth to wey Butter, Chéese, Flesh, Tallow, Waxe, and euery other thing that beareth the name of Garbell, and whereof issueth a refuse or waste.Auoirdupois weight. The difference betwéen these two weightes, Troye and Auoirdupois, is this, that xiiii. oun∣ces and a halfe Troye weight, being xxiiii. s̄. ij. d. sterling, doo make xvi. ounces Auoirdupois weight, at this day, and accor∣ding to the same rate vii. poundes Auoirdupois, make the gal∣lon in measure:Difference of weightes. xiiii. pounds the pecke, xxviii. pounds the halfe bushell, and lvi. pounds make the bushell, the which bushel iust∣ly accordeth with the lxiiii. poundes Troye weight, as is before mentioned.

with the Foyst thereof.

And the summe of stones in the load, is eight times twentie, and eight stone. And it is proued by twelue times 14. An. 14. Ed. 3. Cap. 12.

Twelue of the same inches shall make the foote, thrée foote shall make the yard, and sixtéene foote and a halfe, shall make the polle or pearch to measure land or wood withall. In many countries this polle or pearch doth va∣ry, as in some places it is eightéene foote, and in some other pla∣ces xxi. foote, as by auncient custome is allowed. Of the which

And of these pases Iunius writeth,The difference daies. that there is Passus duplex, & passus minor vel simplex, pas∣sus duplex, is fiue foote as aforesaid, but passus minor vel sim∣plex, is but two foote and a halfe, which is vsually the distance from the toes of the fore foote, vnto the héele of the hinder foote in going. And also he saith, that passus maior siue Geometri∣cus is a pase, or fathame of fiue féete, there is also passus Gre∣cus, & passus Romanus, passus Grecus, being more then pas-Rsusomanus by a foote, and the fourth part of a foote in the The Assise and order for Brewers, aswell of Ale as of Beere.

The beere Fir∣king shall holde and containe ix. gal∣lons and vpwards, the beere Kilder∣king xviij gallons and vpwardes, and the beere Barrell xxxvi. gallons and vpwardes, according to the English gallon, be∣fore mentioned. These being the true contents of Beere and Ale vessels, the
Brewers that are to sell by them,Vnholsome drinkes. are likewise thus restrained by lawes. Viz. that they brewe not their Ale nor Beere of any musty malte or eaton with wiuels, nor put any Ale or Beere to sale, in any musty or corrupt vessels, or in any vesselles of a lesser content then before mentioned: neither must they make any newe vessels within their owne houses,New vessels not to be mad by brewers. to vtter their Ale and Bere in, sauing that they may kéepe Coopers with∣in their houses, onely to Hoope, Cobble, and amend their ves∣sels and not otherwise.

And for asmuch as the misterie of brewing, as a thing very néedfull and necessary for the common wealth, hath beene al∣waies
by auncient custome & good orders, practized and main∣tained with in Cities, Corporat, Borroughs, and market Townes of this Realme, by such expert and skilfull persons,Brewers to be apprentizes or skilfull men in the mistery. as either were traded and brought vp therin, by the space of seauen yeares, and as prentize therein accepted: accordingly as in all other Trades and Occupations, or els well knowne to be such men of skill and honestie, in that mistery, as could and would alwaies yéeld vnto her Maiesties subiects in the com∣mon wealth, such good and holsome Ale and Beere, as both in the qualitie and for the quantitie thereof, did euer agrée with the good lawes of the Realme. And especially to the comforte of the poorer sorte of subiectes: who most néede it: vntill of late yeares, sundry Persons enhabiting within the foresaide liber∣ties, rather séeking their owne priuate gaine, then the publique profite of their countrie: haue not onely erected and set vp small brewhouses at their pleasures: but also brew and vtter uch Ale and Beere, for want of skil in that mistery, as both in the prices and holsomnes thereof: doth vtterly disagrée with the goodlawes and orders of this Realm: thereby also, ouer throwing the greater and more auncient brewhouses: and the estate of the saide mistery of brewing. It is therefore very necessarie, that the Maior, Baylifes, or other hedde Officers of euery Citie, corporate, borough, or market townes within this realme, where such great and auntient brewhouses are, doe take such good order by vertue of their Charters graunted to them, either by her Highnes, or her noble progeniters: as that within these liberties, ye aforesaid auntient brewers and brewhouses, may bee recontinued and maintained, and those new erected houses, with their vnskillfull owners, suppressed and put downe, which as it hath beene, so doubtlesse would it be the best and surest meanes of maintayning that misterie, and vnto the common wealths most profite. The Assise and order for Inholders and Victulers.

FIrst the lode, which men call the cart or waine∣teight, is reckoned to be twenty hundred weight of Auoirdupois weight, accounting a hundreth & twelue pounds vnto euery hundreth,The assise of Heye. but for as much as her maiesties subiects enhabiting néere vnto ye Citie of London, cannot very easily, or well loade their cartes or waines with hey, of such great weight, and so carry the same vnto the citie. They do reckon and account eightéene hundreth weight of Auoirdupois weight, to be the common loade of hey, the which they make and sise as followeth: that
is to sale, that xxxvi. trusses of hey shall make the loade, euerie trusse of hey, to wey the full weight of fiftie sixe pounds of A∣uoirdupois, and after that rate, one pound of hey sold for a ob. maketh foure poundes foure shillings the loade in mony: two pounds of hey for a ob. make xlii. s. the loade: thrée poundes of hey for a ob. make xxxi. s. vid. the load: & foure pounds of hey for a ob. make xxi. s. the loade the which assise or weight in hey, the Inholders and others retailing the same, ought to obserue and kéepe.
