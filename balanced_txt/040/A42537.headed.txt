To Mr ROBERT VVHITEHALL at the VVels at Astrop. PRorogued terme prolongs our meeting, Accept then Robin this for greeting, As much as if in Belgick Roomer, We dranke all Astrop this hot Summer, W' have cur'd the Scurvy, yes and a-Toe, By sending Ano-waters , I have seven Doctors, not in Rockets That ply the Waters, but in pockets, But that so many Dunnes and Leeches Have drained quite my Physick breeches, Ab ipso fonte, not, that's cooler, But in Bottles Trio-bolar We dayly tope, rare cure Sple-netick, By Diaphor and Dieu-retick. Vnder my Roome, that's high you'l say, Are men of Via lactea, Which every morning come to clear-um With whey, which some call Lactis serum. I am a water-Ratt, my skill is To follow thee and Doctor VVillis: For if these prove not good as Spaw, Or Tunbridge, then I must have Law, When our Vice-Chancellour we speedily greet, For these I write are my best feet: And so have at thee, I am bouzing In bottles six that's half a dozen, Which makes us frisk like any Satyrs, But not with wood Nymphs, no such matters;
Keep with thy Gallants and their Paddyes, For we want nothing, not your Ladyes: And now as any thing of Fame, So Astrop waters change their name; Their Cures into their Titles go, As Rivulets to the seas flow; Wherefore whatso'ere your dosing cupp Seemes to powre out at Asterop. It ends in sovereign; under seale Declar'd the Pan-obstruction-Heale Like to a Prince in triumph seen, Or'e Scurvy, Stone, Astmas, and Spleen: Therefore let none my friends defeate you Potate strenu√®, & Valete. E. G.
