To the Highe and mighty Prince: CHARLES: By the grace of God, KING of England, Scotland, France, and Irland: Defendour of the faith, &c. All Grace, peace and felicity Everlasting. MOSTE GRATIOVS SOVERAIGNE: Becaus the children of God bee peaceable, and the Kingdom of heaven be∣longeth to the poore in spirit, and contention is a hinderance of under∣standing, and Skorners are farr from it: becaus wisdom is the true happines, and stops the mouth of iniquity: becaus the lion and the serpent is vanquished, and Iu∣stice raigneth, and the Turtle dove is com and heard in our land: becaus the glory of the law & the strength therof shineth in your Majesties hart, by cleernes of judgement & golden verity: becaus your Majesty is the Prince of peace; & an endles gouvern∣ment is layd upon you; and none els is fitt to sit upon the Throne of David: I humbly present unto your Majestyes handes, this Scepter of the Psalmes of David, his ser∣vice & my paines to your Majestyes service; as fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour, & Scepters to whom Scepters belong, beeing an instrument full of eyes, sharp & provident & fitt for gouvernment, made of Moses and the Prophets, & hath Christ and his Apostles looking on it. That your Majesty may never bee weary of beholding it: when your Majesty shall perceive how potentiall it is made for the Church: by sweet invitation of skorners, by revelation to the Ignorant, and re∣solution to the straitened. How therby, the wisdom of the Ministry of that great congregation and Allowance of the Temple of Ierusalem, and their blessing of the poore, with instruction, & crowning of them that keep the law & reprobation of the contentious, to answer all reprochers: the most heavenly perfection of the church, that beareth all peace and beatitude, is brought to light. By dividing the waters of the Scriptures and making a cleer passage through the depth therof. The rod of government that ceaseth all contention in them, and melteth the hard rocks & bringeth liquor of life out of the same. Considering the heighth of the stile, and depth of the invention; the reach of the work, and largenes of Matter, becaus the world (I suppose) have no more such piles: I make your Majesty the Pillar and stay of all. And as the deliverance is upon the knees of your Majestyes Dominion: that your Majesty may live in them, and they bee susteined by your Majesty, that your Majesty my live eternally with them, and they with your Majesty, that your Majesty bee ever blessed by them, & they by your Majesty, that your Majesty may sanc∣tify them, & they may sanctify your Majesty. That your Majestyes name may bee their sanctuary, & they the Ministers to extoll the same, as long as the sunn and moon la∣steth. That by the light in the night of them, & the clowdynes in the day time: they may, & the Church may, & all the Godly may, walk safe & untouched of the Enimy, and live and Conquer for ever. Seeing all kinde of rule and art & government & regularity is conteined in them, that nothing is wanting. That your Majesty like David may lead yours with a skillfull hand, & feed them hartily. And thus have your Majesty a most glorious entrance into the strong and invincible citty of Da∣vid, the fort of Sion. Where all the blinde and lame are smitten, and a most hea∣venly pile of cleernes and uprightnes and Kingdom of knowledge is erected. By Principles in the tongue, and in religion, and in divinity, by letter and figure, till it
come to a perfection of strength & glory for the defendour, & such was the occasion of this work. The work is so well knitt together from Psalme, to Psalme, & one mat∣ter to another, and one thing with another: that they are not to bee sundred for the strength therof. And that your Majesty may say the same: and perceive, how the stile is lifted from the ground, & how the heavenly understandíng is overcovered with cloudes: I here present a revelation therof, by naturall Arguments rising from them, for your Majesty to lean on, while your Majesty ministreth just judgement, & giveth the strength of the Law to your people, to feed on. And that your Majestyes endes may bee ever blessed: that the wicked bee Cutt off, and the just may ever possess the land & peace enough to delight them. And now the vail of all is drawen & the light is manifest: I moste humblely submit all to your Majesty, the Shield of Truthe, and end with Iob. No man can bee silent for want of knowledge. I therfor repent; and give over, pray your Majestyes pardon, & conclude with prayer for your Majestyes dayes and raigne, as the dayes of heaven with all happynes. Your Majestyes moste humble subject, ALEXANDER TOP.
To the Reader. COnsider, Gentle Reader, that all Knowledge and Learning is descended fom rudenes, and inclines to return unto it. With much pain it was brought forth: so with might and main it must bee held up, lest all runn into confusion again. And this is the work of the Prophet. All piles incline to confusion thefor hee seeketh to save the Law. Because in language ther bee many kindes. weigh his rule, hee write∣eth upon the five books, five books: under the five beginnings out of the five books; to wit, the first wordes of every book. That he so purposed: the ends and the beginnings, do throughly prove. They make every one a perfect conclusion, and beginn directly upon the first wordes of the same book in the Law. Though the books bee precisely five: yet the number of the psalm continueth through all, which cannot but intend mys∣tery. This way is not strange to Poets, to descant upon words by allegoricall discours. by this, hee travaileth onely upon the mysteryes, and doubtfullnes of the Law, or the termes of it, in the propheticall or heavenly stile, takeing his frame from the Prophets. And this shall suffice to make the psalmes to argue the Law. Every glory hath his co∣vering: Is. 4. so the psalms are a brief copy of the Law. They treat of the Law and of the King, as every Law must have a King. as it is a kingdom. The Law is made out of the vertues, and the psalms extll it much out of the names of God. The psalms do carry a fair outward stile, but their treasure is within them; and that is their holines. They are indeed the revelation of the Law and the Prophets. His way is all upon A. B. C. defect, abounding, or disordered, becaus the Letters bee so significant. This is no strange lerning, for most of the other books of he bible play the like. By any strangenes in the constructiō, you shal find the mystery. he works every psalm to agree with the num∣ber of it, by the significatiō of the letters: becaus the letters in the tongue be so significant, that it were absurd to neglect thē, of frowardnes to thwart the allusion, or to cross them. Vnder such a cloud hee passeth, and with such a vail hee revealeth. The curiosity is not to bee wondred at, yf you consider the diligence of the Masorites, and Rabbins, and their thirteen rules for the study of the Law. He draweth all to the immortall life of the Law, and the kingdom of God, and the power and glory therof, the way of God∣lines, and commendation therof, for his title PRAISES. yf this bee his way, I have set your feet therin, and I rejoyce. As for my way: first I have not versed the Psalms, becaus they can carry no mystery with us, & becaus the coherence is scattered, by the curiosity of the work, that it is like a latine vers, with great distance between the Concords, neither can a psalm be construed but with relation from end to end. I have cut them into three parts, so much the better to conclude them: by how much the greater the sections are, for the gathering of the more sens before the pause. The busines of every psalm beeing threefold: the section naturally agreeth. As a Proposition, Example, and Conclusion. Mark the first psalm. Such a one is happy. How? Like a tree &c. And why? Becaus. or for, &c. So moste commonly the division will answer to thes questions, what, how, and why, though the psalm cannot bee cut precisely at the question. My Quotations are ordered in three Columnes, unversed, for the multiplicity of them. The first of Psalms, the next of the Law and first Prophets, to wit, all the books to Isaiah. The last, all from Isaiah and likewise the new testament. They are of as many kindes as ther can be questions: somtimes for the language, somtimes for sens, somtimes for matter, sometimes for form, sometimes for phrase, sometime for wordes, and some∣time for construction, quality, time or place, &c. by the points they are to bee apply∣ed. You shall know them by their fruit, and shall soon see by the recommendation of places in the psalmes: what profit will com of the rest of all the books, yf they were requoted accordingly. for so the vers may well be spared. For variation of the let∣ter both in word and Clause: it manifesteth, how the Construction goeth, and accent∣eth the matter and sense of every Psalme; and that in many respects. The Capitals are for Generals, to which all parts have relation. And they are usually doubled and mul∣tiplyed: that they may be noted. The change in the Clause, is a satisfaction to all que∣stion,
according as the stile declineth: often doubled and multiplied also. My arguments are of this sort; first, a representing of the psalme, in proper or figurative language. Secondly, a Construction which applyeth it self wholely to the letters and exposition of them. And thirdly, how every psalm hath dependance from the first words of his pro∣per book of the law. And all is to revive the Prophet, and bring his glory to light, for a light unto all nations, and a glory to our own. God give Light, and also Grace. Farewell. Thine in the Lord. A. T

ARGVMENTS VPON THE PSALMS. PSALM I. AS the Law is the touch-stone of the lives of men: so this work of Psalmes is to bring them to it, Psal. 26, and this Psalme the formost to shew the way. Heer the judgement and justice therof is layed to the rule and weighed. And seeing all that men would haue is but happi∣nes of their liues, and Eternity: hee sheweth, by a short description, the way to it. To avoyde the Enimyes, and all impediments therof, the wicked counsell of transgressers; to leaue the known way of Sinn, Psa. 36, and not to skorn instruction: And this person hee maketh the proud and skornfull Enimy, the Hethē. And to haue a delighte in the law, and to meditate, and muse, and talk of it allwayes, both for his counsell, and his way, and to be in love with the doctrine therof, Psal. 26. and this is for the person of the church, Psal. 112. So that yf you will liue long, with much happines: this summeth up the evil that is to be shunned, as Ps. 34, and the great good to be doon, and the great peace that insueth, and the Eternall happi∣nes that followeth, Ps. 112. which two persones are but one, because the avoyding of the one, doth the other. Therfor was that tree of life, the Law, made so inviolable that all was upō hāding of and forbearāce; and that for the willfulnes of nature, Ps. 36, 58. and frowardnes of conceit, as Psal. 51. Then yf a man will attein unto eternall life: hee must keep the cōmandements, Ps. 15, 26. which in this work, together with thē, the Creed, and Petition of the Church, are moste sweetly and harmoniously handled, Ps. 25, according to God his promiss to the blessed, and the goeing out of the wicked. This is the way of Mercy which God will make known, and judgement from Com: the second. Exod. 20. God is familiar with righteous men and regardeth them: but casteth away the wic∣ked out of his sight, and taketh no notice of thē, nor hath anie acquanitance with them. So the Godly shall remain immoveable by any tempest of the world, and continue firm, and doe good, and prosper, by the mercyes and love of God: and the ungodly, by uncon∣stancey, fade away, and vanish by his judgement. And this standeth for the beginning of wisedom, Psal. 111.112. wher the immortality and prosperity of this tree of life is ful∣ly set out. This book is for Genesis, the Creation of mankinde, and importeth the principles, and the Grammer of the lives of men. As for the first letter Aleph, which beginneth the book, and is title of the Psalme, and is so often repeated: sheweth, that that letter must rule the construction. It serueth for the law, instruction, and God; the ground of all salvation. The mystery is in the Doctrine of the Eternall, opposed to the counsell of the wicked, shewing, that doctrine and counsell is one and the same thinge, Psal. 32. this word is twise together vttered and harped upon, for beeing his dayly study,
and exercise, so Aleph for beginning; and Aleph for lerning, and Aleph for teacheing, beeing the title and nomber of the Psalme: sheweth wholely the way of construction therof, the often vseing the word, Way, sheweth a mans way and life is one thinge, which is termed a tree for the branches of instruction and cariage. This doctrine and Law and word of God is the way of the righteous, opposed to the way of the wicked. The one shall be for euer explaned, but the other extinguished. The way of the righteous is the way of the eternall, as the gate of the eternall is the gate of the righteous, Psal. 118. and therfor it is manifest to him, ther is a tree of knowledge which maketh not happy: but a good cours or study or cariage of life and good exercise, maketh happy. And thus is the whole life of man divided in this Psalme: com yee blessed, goe ye cursed, by a flat opposition throughout. From the tree of life Gen. 3. The Genesis of this Psalme is in Alep hand Beth, so often repeated in the first and second verses for Ab, which is the Active conjugation, which is the singularity of doctrine, father of all: as ther is but one father of all, as God is one and therfor singular. PSALM II. REbellion and transgression is a moste wicked sinn, and Idolatry and disobe∣dience a childe of witch-craft, which hee maketh to bee the opposition of the trespassers, the proud and skornfull heathen, that will none of the law of God, and consult to break the yoke of obedience and subjection to it, for the terror of Gods promiss, Ps. 70.110. againste them. They will not lern, nor bee advised, nor in∣structed, nor admonished by it, which beeing against the decree, and beeing a ridiculous husbandry of theirs, in the sight of God: hee reprooveth them for stubborn-nes, and willeth, considering the power, and force of destruction of the wrath of God for disobe∣dience, and the happynes of all that love the church and Anoynted, and rely in it, and are not offended at it: that they serue it, and obey him (yf they bee wise) with all reverence and willingnes. Lest in his anger and furious time of judgement, they be like chaff blowen quite away and perish, and all their wayes com to nothing. And seeing all is for effect of the promiss. Psal. 149. and performance of the Law: This Psalme together with the former, conteineth the summ and argument of all the rest. as from the first com: Exod. 20. The content of which two Psalmes furnisheth the whole book with life, as the blood through the body. The Coherencey and relation between them is as the father to the sonn. ther is none commeth except the father draweth: so as the church dependeth upon the Doctrine, this Psalme also dependeth upon the former. and is full of the termes of it, and concludeth with it. The Childe is the righteousnes of the church, Psal. 24. Abraham was father Gen. 15. and the doctrine of the Law. the conducter. Ioh. 6. Is. 54. as Ier. 31. For Construction: Beth, the second, is a house. The Hethen are founded, which is a hous by synecdoche, the worldly prince-es reject the principles and will none of the re∣ligion that God offereth, the instruction and Edification of the House and family of Ia∣cob, from Jasar twise: by the multitude of Affixes, Combination or building. God dwelleth in heaven, Tsion is his holy hill, and the church shall hold the inheritance of all the world, and the whole work is instruction or destruction, as of a house. The Genesis or grammer, is signifyed by the word Sonn, twise vse-ed for Binjan a conjugation, the Hethens cohering by the multitude of affixes for combination. For the Actiue conjugation with the Hebrew, is called a father, and the Passiue is called a sonn. for hence, bothe Father and Sonn may well be termed the word, and God, and ever∣lasting Life, Ioh. 1. All kindes rise out of propertyes: so riseth a certain holynes out of the Letter, which make-eth this kinde of father and sonn out of the word. PSALM. III. AS greatnes getteth place: so heer, Davids greatest affliction beeing the cross of his sonns rebellion, is put first, that when as his adversaryes wer many and his
perplexity great by meanes of Saul, yet they neuer deemed him helples and com∣fortless and in the way of desperation, till his own and his only beloved sonne ri∣seeth against him; and in this case they presumed ther was no salvation for him, and that hee could not now bee saued or any way escape, seeing his Enimyes were so nigh him, but haueing his whole relye upon God, hee is not afrayd of any multitude, nor the neernes of any danger. becaus hee is sure of the promiss, that God will bless his people, and save them, and beat their Ennmyes on the cheek and smite out their backbiteing teeth, out of their cheeks, while hee taketh his naturall rest, so that no persecution can preuaile aginst the Godly, for their Saluation is out of sight of the wicked, vpon which word the whole Construction runneth according to the number and signification of the term Ghimel the Name of the third letter, which is Retribution, Benefit or reward. Likewise all kinde of safegard is raised from hence, that hee is defended and Iustifyed, upheld & mainteined and glorified. hee is heard and accepted when hee calleth. And both vp and down sleeping and wakeing hee is ever susteined. and his Enimyes are withstood, and are to be offended and plagued for him. and this is the blessing that hee is grace-ed withall, by his prayer and request to God. the tre∣bleing of the wordes shew the intent. The Genesis is the plurall number in Grammer called in Hebrew leshon rabbim. men∣tioned by treble admiration of the multitude of his Enimyes, and also his defyance of them, though they farr exceeded, and also his confidence in this grace of God and bles∣sing, which hee findeth all manner of security and all kinde of salvation from him, which is righteousnes and euerlasting life, ps. 24, 127, 133. &c. Gen. 15. PSALM. IV. RIghteousnes and Iustice is his God, as Psa. 109, and his glory is his Law, and his cheeff respect is the light therof, Psalm 92, 93. from whence is all his comfort, and deliverance, and joy of hart and peace and secureity. Ps. 21. and from hence hee looketh for releeff in all distress, and is sure to be heard, when hee calleth, as Ps: 50, 91. and concealed and glorifyed. therfor hee reprooveth their reprocheing of him with the superstitious vanityes of their religion and fals God-heads, willing them not to offend in any such commotion against him, but to be contented, quietly vpon their beds, hartily to sacrifice, the Sacrifices of Righteousnes unto God, and cleer themselues before him, as Ps: 84. and then to trust in him for salvation. seeing the re∣sistance heerof is reprobation, as in the divers oblations of Cain and Abel. From the one with a great deal of stirr and fals-hood: from the other, quiet Innocencey of Confession upon his bed, and uprightenes, as an evening offering without sinne, Ps, 141. beeing led by the law according to the wordes, most conveniently agreeing. Genes: 4. For Construction; according to the fowerth letter, which signifyeth a doore, hee mentioneth all along many kindes & properties of doores: that hee would open the doore of instruction, by the lifting up of the light of his countenance▪ and keeping in security: that hee will widen to him in distress: the Lord will hear him: the wicked open their mouthes to his reproch in lyes and vanityes: the Lord will shut him within the vaile to him self; hee commandeth them to their chambers, and to silence and to shut their mouthes: and that the Eternall keepeth the hous safe: and maketh us sleep secure, and hee shuts the doore. From Doore the opening and shutting and keeping is the Mystery. so righteousnes is the doore, ps: 118. and standeth for all sacrifice, as the doore of Fayth, and all sacrifice must bee at the doore, Genes: 3. The Genesis is that part of Grammer called, biclam. to wit, fower letters. b.c.l.m. by which the gerunds are performed. being added to the Infinitive at the begining, inten∣ded in the wordes Chebhodhi le climmah in reproche of my Glory, which was all the practice of the wicked: and his correction of them, that they would be silent, and thinck nothing but right in their harts upon their beds, by the words, bilbhabhchem al mishcabhchem. wher the letters biclam are again repeated to assure you. The third Psalm shewed all the kindes of Salvation: so this psalm, the way.
PSALM. V. YF any man seemeth religious and refraineth not his tong but deceiveth his hart: that mans religion is vain. The like may be sayd of other partes and affecti∣ons. Now becaus the wicked and mischeevous men haue no dwellings nor habitation with God, and are marked to be cast out of doores, as boasters, mo∣lestors, and vexers; lyers, murtherers and deceivers: which can not inherit the king∣dom of God: hee early, ernestly and duely seeketh the same and the righteousnes ther∣of, for his Guide and protection and to explane his way, as an Enimy to all trans∣gression and hypocrisy; and prayeth, that (for dissembling) his enimyes may bee faulty, as Psal. 109. and Ashamed in all their wayes, and faile of their pur∣poses; for rebelling against God and their own hartes: and that hee and all that love his name, may triumph to see the righteous, how gratiously hee is protected, blessed and defended for ever, and this according to the Sinn offring lyeing at the doore, which is the resort of the Godly; for a morning prayer, that as the last Psalm teacheth how to goe to bed: so this same, how to rise, from Gen 4, also. The fift, and the let∣ter He, which is behold as He Jedignah, and signifyed in wordes of all kinde of behol∣ding. Lead mee by thy righteousnes, and direct mee in thy wayes: and in the negatiue or contrary, hee hath no pleasure in the wicked; they shall not dwell with him, they shal not bee in his presence; hee hateth them and lotheth them, Ps. 101. and looseth and de∣stroyeth them: forsaketh them and scattereth and destroyeth them; the corrupt and hid∣den subtilty and rebellion against God can not bee seen, and for their flattery by Salo∣mons rule, their childrens eyes should be put out, to hearken, to look abroad, to com in his hous; to doe worship as his servant in his Temple; Gods protection and covering of him, with a shield of grace which is fayth and is for the mystery of construction in di∣rect and opposit imagination. This for presence to behold and see, Ps. 101. for presenting his oblation and morning prayer which hee would haue marked by the letter and terme He, to say loe, behold, and by the presence of God and approching of the Godly also. The Genesis is he Iedignah a letter of denotation, wherby hee prayeth for right direc∣tion, and a plain way, becaus ther is no certainty in his enimyes mouthes: that can not be known, by means of dessembling, makeing thēselues more then treaspassers, rebelling against all truthe: also by the notable triumphing for the wonderfull favour, and ad∣mirable blessing and salvation upon the righteous, for degrees of Ioy, expressed in sundry wordes; and also of grace. PSALM VI. THe whole tenor of his life beeing just, now the Prophet hath made Iustice his God, Ps. 4. and righteousnes his King and God, Ps. 5. for his whole trust and comfort, safe conduct and protection: according to the honorable way pro∣pounded in the argument, Ps. 1.2. which is a priuat way of salvation that the wicked can not bee ware of, nor acquainted with, Ps. 3. hee meaneth, well to shew the same, in makeing it the tenor and conclusion of all the book, and of euery Psalme con∣teyned in it, for a perpetuall rule of necessity: the band of construction, and the light of the mood and meaning. And according to the definition of Iustice, which is to giue euery man his due: to pay all men according to their work and deserving, as Ps. 62. and to requite them with the measure that proceedeth from them: hee now feeling the ter∣ror that is Enimyes haue caused: and the trouble in his mind, by their vexation: can well tell, what to ask of God, justly to fall upon them. And as hee feeleth the wrath of hell, and snares of death, that draw men into their graves, Ps. 18.55. by a wasteing consump∣tion of the flesh; throughout, his body: hee prayeth for his own deliuerance out of this burning choler, which hee calleth the wrath of God; by his mercys in due time, Ps. 13.30. and that his enimyes may not see his destruction, Ps 8.25. which they wish: And as it hath been a long threatning of death which hee indure-ed: so that they themselues may
bee, throughly terrifyed, and utterly confounded with horror, and suddainly ashamed and astonyed, to see his acceptation and recovery, Ps. 41. And this from thanks and peace offring and sacrifice of remembrance, Lev, 3.7. for Gods mercy upon true peni∣tencey and confession, which Death and the pitt can not perform. But is heere expressed by this his terror and bashfulnes even to consumption. Like the falling down of the countenance of Cain, by the wordes of terror and bashfulnes repeared, which thing the very number of the Psalme, the letter Van doth signify; which also signifyeth a hook or crook. So, that hee would not lay hold on him, and seize on him in his anger, but pittyfully, and gentle-ly; becaus hee is weak and so terrifyed soul and body, by his sore hand so long upon him: and that therfor hee would heal him of all, and releas him and let him goe, rather then destroy him; and saue him from the grave, from whence, ther is noe redemptiō not fetching again. His sighes fetch teares, and his teares pull out his eyes, by the provocation of his afflictors. Hearing and receiuing, his request, and prayer, and bashfulnes, and terror of the enimy to draw them back: is all the mystery of the con∣struction. The Genesis is Vau hippuc in grammer, for changeing the times that make-eth the time past, the time to come and also the contrary, beeing joyned to the one, it makes the other, and therfore is called Vau, the contrary, or Vau the changeable or conversive. Gods angry correction by David his enemyes, and his terror and indignation hath throughly translated him and changed him; therfor hee would an utter confusion and alteraion of their estate: which is seen, by the comming of the same wordes on bothe sides, first on his part, and after for his enimyes, and also doubled in either place, to make them markable; for such passions turne men again, and changeth and altereth them, by a neat resemblance. PSALM VII. ALL a mans Glory is his life, and all his brightenes is the uprightnes therof, which was excellēt in David, and heerby, hee shine-ed before all men, as Ps. 132, Therfor hee maketh Iustice his rule, and his rule, his soveraigne lord; and his King, his God and religion; by all allegiance. Heerin hee trusteth for all his se∣cureity (in his greatest affliction and persecution) for deliverance, for the pureity and in∣tegrity of his minde, and syncerity of his hart; against which, yf hee hath varyed: hee con∣sidereth and craveth the judgement due without favour, if hee be guilty of the imputa∣tion, and wrong: as to repay his foes or bee revengefull upon his causeles enimyes, as in case of Saul and Absolom impute-ed by Shemei: that his glory may cease, and his life be abase-ed, and all his estimation com to nothing. Cruell and deadly weapons are provide-ed for cruell persecutors, while they plott and conceiue and work destruction by sub∣tile dissembling and fals-hood: their own plots and pitts catch thē, and the cruell strokes of underminers bring the earth upon them. And becaus such was the end and judge∣ment of his enimyes, the wicked, that in malice still work their own destruction: he than∣keth God for his justice, and commendeth the calling upon his name. The Construction is in cleering himself of revenge, becaus it belongeth to God only, and of the seven-fold judgement of God, Gen. 4. according to the figure of seven the number of the Psalme, the letter Zain, due upon persecutors, he shewes also the way of his judgement, as all Gods wordes are judgement, Deut. 33. The Genesis is in Pagnal, a part of speech, which is to work: for all a mans work bringeth judgement, Eccl. 11. which thing will plainly appeer, yf the wordes of perse∣cution, deliverance, work and judgement be considered, with the repetition and declina∣tion of them; for all is but the work of man and the work of God, and the end of bothe. PSALM VIII. BEcaus all Gods service is against his Enimyes, & all his Doctrine for the Salva∣tion of his people: which hee hath made, a statute for Iacob, and an everlasting rule
for Israel, Psal. 80. to binde him by the law of Iustice (as in these former Psalmes) which David maketh his God, Psal. 4. and that the very name heerof is a deadly weapon against Satan and all afflictors, and the calling upon God, the moste so∣veraigne safegard of the church, as Ps. 7. which so commendeth it: when hee bringeth up his children in it, and teacheth them this rule in their ABCes, as in Ps. 25.34.37.111.112.119.145. and for the letters, in the rest, even through the book: to shew, that the workers of wrong, work their own destruction, and this is the Grammaticall lerning that hee hath trayned his church up, in, to make them skillfull in their warr, and their fingers cunning to the battail against his Enimyes. Hee speaketh to the former; by Admiration heerof, so keeping the story of the persecution, all along with the meanes of deliverance; hee steppeth from Psalme to Psalme. And now, hee admire-eth the noblenes of his Name, for the boldnes of Gods children by their fayth and confi∣dence, which hee hath founded upon the righteousnes therof, as on a Rock: and the perfection of Infants in the law, and their strength against their Enimyes, as was that of David in his youth, Ps. 119. M. and the preheminence of wretched and sorrowfull Man, and the great grace of God upon him, above more bewtifull creatures, beeing preferred to the dominion and moste glorious Lordship of all the creation. Makeing him heerby next to God in glory and worship, and able to asswage the mightyest Eni∣myes Ps. 11.16.25. By walking the Sea, Ps. 65.77. From the calling upon God in the Dayes of Enosh Gen. 4. Ps. 116.118. For the strength of Salvation. And this is the weapon David useth against Goliah, when hee playeth upon that Instrument of Gath, the great Goliah of Adversity, and Captivity of Phelistia. The construction is in the term Heth, for the eigtth letter, and number of the Psalme, which signifyeth subjection, and awe of all creatures unto Man, in Shem, a nown, ano∣ther part of speech in hebrew. The Genesis is his Name, the Excellency wherof is pointed at, in the first and last verses, also in the end of the 7. And beginning of the 9. For the nown and name set upon all creatures, in heaven & earth. Gen: 2. and the strength of lerning in the Ele∣ments, to commande them. PSALM IX. POverty sayeth Salomon in his Parables, cometh like an armed man, and as it is a terrible thing: so the affliction of the church and the defendour and their greevous adversity, persecution and captiuity, is well heer resembled by the story and person of Goliah, and his death. Who comming with all the odds in the world for stature, yeers and weapons, wherby hee seemed invincible, yea, even as matchless as death it self, so that the state of the church, and David himself, now beeing at deathes doore with the terror of their own affliction: and haveing noe other weapons then the Law, and five bookes of Moses, and their confidence in the righteousnes therof, as their God: and the calling upon his name for his defense: and the preaching therof, as the five smooth stones out of the river: which hee had in the budget of his bosome, and slung out of his mouth, as Ps. 40. and in the name of this God of hostes, of Israel, hee setteth out against the Giant (ther beeing no odds against God) and slew him, and rather (as men say) slew the divill: for this victory hee com∣mendeth the Iustice of Gods Iudgement, and chaunteth out of his invincible Name and service of him, according to the former Psalme. The Iustice heerof is, as they the Phelistines pretended Terror: that they now meet with their match, and are knocked in the head by the Prophet, that feareth them by the word of God, as Ps· 56. that feareth not the face of Man. And this is terror for terror, that man should not presume, with might to oppress, seeing ther is no prevailing against God. And that the hethen & all earthly men should know, and feel their own thraldom and wretchednes, by a work of their owne handes. and this for the person of Enosh, for a sorow-full time. Gen. 4. likewise a Thanks-giveing, vpon the death of that proud and mighty champion, and Gods Iudgement vpon him.
The letter Tet doth signifye filthy durt and dust of the street or of the floore: and Teta is also to sweep away. Heerto is resembled the corruption of mans wayes Gen; 6. and the sweeping them away by the deluge & by all maner of sweeping & swift condemna∣tion of the Law, wherin God doth raigne, and hath his Throne, Ps: 29. And such is the Iudgement of God that teacheth the wicked their Lesson, and saveth the Iust, Gen. 6.7. the same word that drowneth the one, is an Ark for the other. The Genesis. is Millah, the other part of speech in hebrew, called the word, or the par∣ticle, beeing neither nown nor Verb. And for to signyfye so much, hee bringeth all the Abce double, in two verses. in the wordes: the Hethen are sunk, &c. which wordes be∣ginn with Tet, becaus the letters are members of the word, and of the Ark of Salvation called Tebhah. And thus is the wickeds Iudgement from God, moste Iust. They are drowned in their own corruption. Only the letters Tsade and Aleph, which make Tse, exi, for exception or Tse: excretum, are not at all mentioned among them. Becaus thes letters make, goe out, of the Ark: they are left out of the Ark: that is the Abce. Gen. 8. PSALM X. EVery prevailing is a Giant, and every overcomming, a man of a great stature, and every Captivity, a Goliah. When the wicked get the vpper hand, and brag of their wills and their harts desire, and stand at defiance, like the Phelistins, by the mouth of Goliah: then the world goeth hard, and it is a sore and a painfull time, and the people of God are in a sorrowfull case. So now, they beeing wonderfully dejected terryfyed and daunted, and takeing themselues almoste forsaken: call upon God (their fortress, as Ps. 9.) as yf hee wer now out of hearing, and out of sight also. And becaus they need incouragemant out of the word; their request to God is, that their Enimyes may bee over-reached, and taken in their own reaches, and drawn with the nets of their wicked thoughtes, seeing they haue no thought of God, but blaspheme all parts of his name; thinking to destroy the poore unregarded, and to slay the innocent and harmless, in secret, and to draw them by heapes, by their terror and deceipt, against the Iudgement and power of God. For pride of their prosperity, they can not see God, nor his determination: so that as hee lyeth in secret; Gods purpose may bee ever unknown to them; and seeing wickednes, deceipt and terror is all his power: that God would serch it all out, and break his malicious arme, and help the poore that rely on him. And as God abideth not the Hethen in his land: so that hee would listen, and graunt the request of the meek, that they may injoy their possession ac∣cording to the Promiss, and to make thē stout and couragious; and to defend the poor and cōtrite Orphans, that the earthly men bee no more a terror to thē. Prosperity makes thē proud, and pride makes them without judgement, and so, they blaspheme that part of his Name. Besides, for Gods patience, they question his power, and blaspheme an other part of his Name. And also thirdly, presume against the everlasting Iustice of God, that condem∣neth all the hethen, and expelleth them out of the inheritance of the Lords Dominions, as Ps. 2.114. that heer hee would answer them with his word, and put a good courage in their harts, against all these; that no cowardize or terror assail them any more. Construction. Iod, the tenth, is a hand. The hand of the wicked and the hand of God conteineth all. The wickeds hand is mentioned in reckoning all kinde of cor∣ruption of man, Gen. 6. and excess of wickednes: in thought, in word, and in their wayes. Gods hand is an utter destruction of them, and a revenge of wrong, and releeff of the oppressed, according to Ps. 9. Ther is nothing but ill in the arme of the wicked: and his confidence is to remain still, becaus hee is, in no ill: he prayeth that God would break this Arme of his, by findeing out the ill that is in him, to wit, rang in rashang, ill in the terme of a wicked man. The Genesis, is in Iod Gentíle, the nations feele the judgement of God, and are wipe-ed clean out of his land for ever, according to the work of their own handes, Ps. 9. For as the ninth handled the judge and judgement: so this Psalme handleth the Cause, co∣heering therunto, and belonging to the same.
PSALM XI. HVmility and innocence makes men bold, and this maketh the poor to leave themselves upon the providence of God in al distress, in the last Psalme. Yf men be but a litle tryed, how happy are they yf they trust in God, and rely on him, Ps. 2. and what a defense is hee to all that relye on him, as Ps. 18. And this maketh David a moste resolute man, that how soever they seek to terrify him, with the wicked against him, and preparation and readynes of expedition and secrecy against upright mē, to destroy and overthrow all good indevours of thē: and will haue him to fly and secure him by the hills, as birds doe, and like unto Lot in distress, yet beeing sure, that the judge of all the world will doe right, his whole rely is on God; who in his holy temple and the Sacred Scriptures, well seeth the dealing, and hath experience of all men. And becaus hee approoveth the just and detesteth the injurious; the wicked shall taste the cup of his wrath, and the just God, that loveth uprightnes, wil regard him. Hee thus relyeth upon his approbation by the word of God, and the condemnation of his pur∣suers, by the Terms of just and wicked men; and will not hearken to other refuge, as Ps. 75. after the Story of wicked Sodom and just Lot, Gen. 19. Construction. Iadah, is to cast: or shoot, and Aleph is instruction, the wicked shooteth at all uprightnes and oppugneth learning, to destroye it, and God casteth snares and fire and brimstone at him, the wicked envyeth the just, but God regardeth him, by Gods eyes and affection and action, is meant kindes of casting. The Genesis is the equall division of the 22 letters into radicalls and servils, the radi∣calls are in these: Ch, t, S, ph, r, G, z, ng, Ts, d, q, which are the ground-work and m, sh, h, u, C, l, b, A, I, th, n, in which are the ferviles. These are allotted for slavery, captivity and stormes of disturbance; for desturbing, like the wicked and injurious: when God hath the just allwayes in his eyes, which are the fundamentall Radicals. PSALM. XII. THe true way of Godlynes is Grace and truthe, kindenes and faythfullnes, fayth and love, as Ps. 25. which is the life of a just man, the Soul of the law and founda∣tion of the church; which flesh and blood can not reveal or make visible to the eyes of man. Now in time of Lot, when in a citty was not a just family; no, not ten just persons could be found to redeem it, for the abundance of iniquity and Dominion of Sinn that reigned among them: hee asscribe-eth it wholely to base people in authority; that are full of flattery, bragging, pride and dissembling, of willful riot and churlishnes, that will abide no instruction, that haue no gentlenes or faythfullnes or honesty in them: and this hee maketh also a sorrowfull and a greevous time, and a moste improsperous season for good men: that hee cryeth, God help, as yf they wer all gon, and eaten out by devourers, Ps. 14. Now becaus God hath promissed to saue the church from all kinde of conspiracy, spoile and persecution, and to hear their cry: and that his word is through∣ly tryed and found never to faile, but is above all his service, Ps 138. and whatsoever he sayeth, that commeth to pass, and is made good and confirmed: hee prayeth God to pre∣serve the faythfull and the meek, from the children of this world. And for the purenes and approvednes of this word, as Ps. 119. is: that hee would cutt of all flattering, and dissembling-hollow-harted worldlings, and wicked men, that thus rise and conspire against the meek. Construction. The letters are to weep, or houl, and accordingly the time is lamen∣ted and the poor cry: when nothing but cruelty and pride and falshood raigneth. The Genesis is Moshe ve Caleb, seven of the servile letters, when no such as Moses for meeknes, nor Caleb for fidelity, can be found. But cruelty, and pride, and falshood is the property of slaues, especially in authority, beeing weighed, numbred and divided.
PSALM XIII. COuld yee not watch with mee one hower? Mē destitute of the Law and under∣standing therof, haue cold and heavy hartes; and are so much troubled in adver∣sity, with fainting and drowzines: that they will not only forsake their freendes; but evē thēselues also (yf it wer possible) without pursueing, in a litle extremity. David, by looseing the way of God, often looseth his courage, looseth the feeld and fly∣eth, and is overcom and ashamed, and hee is in great sorrow and distress. God is angry with him, the Scriptures turn away their face, they will not abide him, becaus hee hath neglected them, and cast his wordes behinde him, as Ps. 50. they think not on him, they care not for him, they neither esteem him nor succour him. The waters therof bear him not, but hee sinketh when hee walketh upon them. Now becaus this is a persecu∣tion of ignorance, and a distreess of negligence, hee prayeth for Gods loveing counte∣nance again toward him; his comfort and succour and repairer of him, as Ps. 51. that as the eye is the light of the body, and the purenes of the Commandement of God giveth light to the eye, Ps. 19. so that God would instruct him in the pureity, simplicity and singular cleernes of the Law, to saue him. Lest hee should fall a sleep in sensuality, and dye in trouble, and perish immortally by tentatiō. While his afflictors vaunt great∣ly and rejoyce of their prevailing; and his fall by them: that his hart may confidently rejoyce in the wonted way of his salvation, and hee may sing of Gods grace and loveing kindenes that hath don so much for him. And so, as light delivereth out of Darknes, Ps. 97.36. So, out of his intolerable greeff, and sorrow; hee calleth for the compassion of his God, the eternall, trusting wholely upon his grace and loveing kindenes to revive him. Construction. Jag, the letters 13. are to greeve, hee complaineth of his greeff in all kindes, and desireth to be eased, that his enimyes may not rejoyce, and hee may sing, for the goodnes of God unto him. The Genesis is Ethan, A, I, Th and N, the declineing of the future tens in the be∣ginning of the word, as in the first letters of the fower first wordes, and the fower ad∣mirations together shew. Ethan, signifieth strong and hard, Ier. 5. such as was the hand of his enimyes upon him. PSALM. XIV. THe harts of men are full of evill and a generall madnes sweyes them, while they live. By their workes you shall know them. Lay them to the Law, Ps. 15. and wher is one good or kinde or faythfull man, Ps. 12? Bring them to the word, Ioh. 1. and doe they not all stink and favour of corruption, for ill dealing? shew them the Scriptures, and consider the body of them, and goe they not clean contra∣ry, and turn quite an other way? doe they not al rebell abominably in willfullnes, as yf ther were neither God nor any opinion of goodnes among them? haue they not vaine imagi∣nations? are not their foolish harts full of darknes, when they call not upon God, nor seek after him, nor any behaviour of Godlynes? Now how are the holy people of God spoiled, as Ps. 12? And the whole church eaten out with profane-nes, devoured and con∣sume-ed with idolatrous contempt and reproche, by their captivers and molesters, Ps. 79? when the Feare that they fear and the God that they reverence and worship; in the ge∣neration of the Iust: the poore is made to distrust, and to be abashed of their relying on him, Ps. 1. for suffering of so great reproche? That a man would think, ther were no God that regarded them. So complaining of the general corruption of man, and of the greevous calamity of the church, under the Hethen that profess not God, as Ps. 74.79. for that it freats them to death, beeing allmost in despaire: hee prayeth for deliverance, and a return of them from captivity, to praise God and rejoyce, and be merry again in Sion; their glory, their secureity, confidence and Salvation, Ps. 53.56. Construction: Iad, the letters that signify a hand, are heer taken for work and also for counsel, which two kindes runn through the Psalme, to the handy work of captivity. Leading away and bringing again, arguing still ab effectu: denying God by their deeds, either idle or dooing wrong.
The Genesis, is in the 4 quiescents and idle letters with the hebrews, called E he vi, and Grammarians, the sonns of Noah, or children of rest, which becaus they are the letters of the Name of God and are not pronownceed: they are sayd not to call upon God, and to deny God: in the words Iehovah lo quaraow: as the Athists, that will haue none of his wisdom, nor any such understanding: mark the fower Jehovahs and the fower Elohims, mark the fower eins, for a quiescent Iod. For beeing idle and dooing no good, mark the vers. all are gon away, &c. wher al fower are mentioned, mark fear, for one of the 4, Elohims, as Ps. 53. and conclude that the mystery is in Iehovah, and so in Ehevi, as before. PSALM XV. THou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. How shall a yongman keep clean his way, Ps. 119. b? what way shall hee take for eternall life? How shall hee save himself that hee fall not, and that his enimyes prevaile not over him, as Psal. 13. seeing the Godly are so few, and good men so rare, Psal. 12.14? wher is the rout and assembly of thē? are they known by their dwelling or by their guests? Surely the tabernacles of God are with men, and hee suppeth, and dine-eth, and sojourneth, and dwelleth with whom hee like-eth, and so dwell they invisiblely with him. And this tabernacle of God and Mount of holynes, is nothing but the habitation of Godlynes in man, after they once re∣ceiue him; they dwell with God, who hath him in their mindes: and God dwelleth with thē that love him and keep his commandemēts, and their wayes are unreproovable. And for this, hee wondereth that ther is any way to it, or that any man can ascend to it, seeing the way is so strait and strict that leadeth unto life, and the entrance therinto so hard to finde. What things are to be don, who is the childe of Godlynes, and who shall dwell with God and liue perpetually, and what kinde of church shall never be mooved. So hee describe-eth the church of God by the statutes therof, with a promiss of eternity to the performers, Ps. 133. who they are and the greatnes of their glory, is expres∣sed over and above in the 24 Psalme, by the royallty of their entertainment, and also as Psalme 101. The doore of righteousnes, Ps. 118. and also by the fifteen Psalmes of Ascensions thither, Ps. 120, &c. called the Psalmes of degrees. This is the way of God and of the just, Ps. 25. which shall not perish, Ps. 1. and the wise mans profound and sure building, upon a rock, that abides all wether against the sandy shallownes of the wicked, in the former, Psalme 14.9. & 1. which the flood commeth and sweepeth clean away, Gen. 6.7. For the Ark and Noahs walking with God, in thought, word, and deed: an up∣right man. This is, the work of salvation which must be wrought for the inheritance of eternall life. Construction: The letters Tau, that signify to spinn, as ther is a threed of life: doe heer import extortion, oppression and detraction. For thes all bee proper, by wringing and wresting from his neighbour, to diminish him. Beside, by the letters apart, Tet, is the con∣tēptible dust of the floore, rejected of all; and Vau is the love of the Godly, and hooking, by wrong giving and receiving. The Genesis is the tabernacle, which is the Ark, and that the word, that rested upon the hills of Ararat, and hee that shall abide in it, is Noah, to wit, the quiescent or som letter of grammer; while hee is just and upright, Gen. 6. to his neighbour or next letter, for so long shall a letter abide as his fellow can indure him, and yf his behaviour faile: hee is either changed or put clean out, but with som token of corruption and deficiencey; and this you may wel see in the two defective wordes, Nathā and Laquah wher, in declineing neither N, nor L. can abide for offending. By 3 dooings and 3 refreinings, twise the like. PSALM. XVI. WHer a mans treasure is there is his hart, and what is a mans God but his cheeff delight, Ps. 4? And what pleasure is ther like to salvation? and where is the fullnes of Ioy, but the redemption from Ignorance; the
light and knowledge and perfection in the Law of God? a way of a virtuous life without corruption, Psal. 14.15. a way of Immortality, a way not of the flesh, but of the Spirit, a way, not of worldly walking, but of Godly Cariage, a liveing, true and everlasting way, as ps: 1. a moste pure and clean way, both for reverence and performance ps: 19? This is inward and outward Iustice, consisting in sayth and love ps: 25; the Grace and Truthe of the Gospell, for charitablenes of intention and fayth∣fullnes of performance in every work. Now becaus this Righteousnes is the Sacrifice that is to be sacrifice-ed, & the Iustification of a man that will be saved, Ps: 4; and not any outward oblation: and becaus it can double the kings dayes, and preserve him that relyeth theron, as Psal. 61. and that all Davids nightly consultation, and his innermost Ioy, and even his reines delight in the Instruction of it: and that God is all his good; his part, his share, his cup, his Lot and measures of Inheritance, and all moste goodly to him, in his leviticall blessing: and that all his birth, and parentage, and beginning and end of dayes is the study of the word of God (like Melchisedek) to keep him from falling as Ps. 15: and beeing sure by these graces, hee shall not dye till hee bee perfect in the way of life, and see the full Ioy and pleasures of the word, and sweet exposition therof, by the Ministry: the Kingdom of Heaven, a celestiall government, and Ioy of the holy Ghost; ps. 49.27: hee is made exceeding merry therwith; and accounting all other invocation or relye intolerable: hee will have all his welth and good, and delight, and pleasure whatsoever, to be nothing, in respect of God and this his Name, and way of Salvation, Ps. 4. And becaus his whole relyeing is upon God, and hee is a Saviour of all them that relye on him, Ps. 17. and this is all his way of Salvation; and becaus hee will haue no other God, nor worship nor esteem any thing in the world but him: he prayeth to bee preserved by him. And this from preserving the tree of Life Gen. 3. And so purgeing himself of all idolatry, vain triumphing, pride, glory and reioyceing in worldly things, and relying whole-ly vpon God, and makeing divinity his portion, and is counselled by his word, and preferreth his Law, Ps. 127. hee is greatly cheered, and is throughly confident of all preservation, and of a long and pleasant life, that is ever before God, propounded by his Ministry, called his right hand, in his church. as Psalm 73.110. Construction. The two letters pointeing at Jehovah, shew absteining from all strange Gods; and also his Ioy in the Ministry. hee taketh Iad a hand, in all his senses, for might welth, Sorrow, place, lot or quarter of inheritance: to counsel, teach and maintein; and the right hand for promotion. Vau is taken privative, with negative signes, that though the signification be craveing as is the term hook or crook: yet by construction, it is sayd as wel to leave, and let goe, as to hold; as both are the propertyes of a hand also. Genesis: The kindes of quiescents are many, as welth, and pleasure, and delight, and Ioyes, and counsell and instruction from God. They are for his harts ease, like a Mariage day: Gods word gives him all content by the Ministry, his right hand, in which words the Name of the Eternall so sweetly resteth, and that without deficiencey. For hee re∣fuseth all the contrary, with note of deficients as Iod in Iissarowni and Nun thrise with bal. And thus by avoyding of Defection hee mainteineth the Quiescents. PSALM XVII. LAy up for your selues treasure in heaven, wher neither moth nor canket?? corrup∣teth, nor theeves break through and steal. David observeth from Samuel, that moth-eaten and rusty imagination of Saul; how hee robs God of his honour by his disobedience, and the worm of his corrupt conceit, that all together ne∣glect his commandement and break it, to have his own will and pleasure fullfilled, for som respect that hee graved to himself, and worshipped: by his estimation of the goodly things of the world, Princees and fatlings. Which becaus it is rebellious transgression, and a willfull offense against the Law of God, not to obey the word of his mouth: but to bee bewitched with his pleasure, and to make an Idol of his will: and marking this well: hee excuseeth himself of counterfeiting in his prayer, or dissembling in his request
unto God, but that all is according to justice and equity; and that hee will bee tryed by God that seeth all. Therfor hee requesteth ernestly, that his steps may be kept still in the Law of righteousnes, Ps. 16. that his feet slip not into the wayes of them that fall, and that hee follow not a king, or please a multitude in doing of evill: and for this, hee justly prayeth unto him that is saviour of all (by his ministry) that rely on him, Ps. 18. and hee haveing repose-ed all his treasure in God, & his undefiled way of righteousnes, Ps. 16. that hee will hide his grace-es and favours from them that rise against him, and that hee will keep him as watchfully, as the eyelid saveth the sleepy eye, Ps. 77. and protect him and save him, by his truthe, called the shadow of his wings, Ps. 91. from all his wicked eni∣myes that spoyl him, Ps. 12. and his ill wishers, that on every side lay siege for his life, that haue greasy thoughtes and proud words: and watch as greedily and as privily to over∣throw him, as a lion for prey. Now, his life beeing in hazard thus among his opposits, that haue their bellyes full of the treasure and blessings of this life; and spare for their children after them; that have their portion and delight therin, that are their own carvers in this world, and worship the work of their own handes, and their wicked inventions; becaus they be enimyes of God; that with his sword and his power, hee would stand be∣fore him, make them stoop, beat him down, and deliuer him; seeing when hee awakes and beholdes in righteousnes, but the image of Gods Law, called his countenance, and hath a perfect understanding therof: hee hath enough and is satisfyed, and hath all hee loo∣keth for, with full contentment. Construction: It beginnes with the letter Zain, to hear, and therfor hath all the words of that sense comming together in divers places. The other letter Iod, or Iad, a hand reacheth all over the Psalme, in the attributes, wayes and exploites of the wicked, and also salvation by Gods right hand, and by his sword and his hand from all such, bothe the letters make Iez to sprinkle, for the proud aspersion of the wicked. Genesis. For defectives hee sheweth his own syncerity that his mouth and his hart agreeth, and hee abandoneth the way of ravenous incrocheing and defective men; which he maketh the moste prosperous in this life, which doth most spoyle. The token of defi∣cients bal, thrise repeated, mortall men twise. They are counted dead men and deficient that haue their part only in this life. The wordes of deficiency, that in minde cast about to destroy, &c. His quiesciencey is in the image of God. PSALM XVIII. THe full assureance of understanding and the riches therof, is to know the Myste∣ry of God the father and of Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Thou art my beloved sonn, in thee I am well pleased, in the last Psalme 17. hee prayeth hartily for the heavenly light and revelatiō heerof, and in this Psalme hee seeth the effect of his prayer. The heavens open, the spirit of meeknes descendeth after affliction, and hee becommeth wise, Psal. 119. th, after a sea of troubles, whē hee is baptized and haue passed through fire and water, and cō to refreshing, Ps. 66. and seeing hee is saveed, for putting all manner of rely and confidence in God, and God heard him, and is angry with his enimyes, and commeth with a mighty rage and terror, secrecy and swiftnes against them: and bringeth him out of affliction, and relea∣seth him, to shew his love unto him: and that hee should not call upon God in vain that keepeth his wayes: but that hee should be rewarded according to his righteousnes, and his innocency before him; dealing still frowardly with his enimyes, but kindely with his servant, by giveing grace and salvation to the humble, and bringing down the proud looks. Now becaus ther is no way of salvation but Gods, and hee lightens his candle of understanding, and makes his darknes to shine, through which his way is perfect, for any breach or assalt, for relyeing on him: that ther is none but God that saveth him, by strength in his loynes, perfection of his way, surenes of footing, advantage of the ground, cunning of his hādes, and strength of his arme: that sheilds him and saves him, and that the lowlynes of God and his Ministry advanced him; and thus did hee beat down his enimyes and hee was delivered, and they called in vain, for ther was none to save them, for they
set light by his law, Psal. 137.50. and God had hid his favours from them, and favoured thē not, according to his request, Ps. 17. and brought them low in subjectiō and consumed them, Ps. 55.59. and made him a famous conqueror without strife. And for this, hee blesseth the God of his salvation for all, for his revenge, for his commāde, for his escape, for his advancement among the Hethen, and deliverance from that cruell one Saul, that was kinde to cruell Amalek. Therfor hee, will thank the Name of the everlasting among the heathen, for so great kindenes and salvation to him, and his seed for everla∣sting generations, Ps. 17. Construction. Heer ther are many handes, and that of divers sortes: the hand of God, the hand of the enemye, and the hand of David himself, and the hand of God hath the way of salvation, and a way of punishment. Hee saveth by light, sure footing, broad feet and sharp like deer, becaus David is pure handed. Hee punisheth with an angry hand, in∣evitable stormes of hail and fire, thunder and lightning, to shew subjection and Dominion deliverances and condemnation, becaus the enimyes hand is snares and affliction, and in∣vasion. He giveth David all virtue and skill to uphold him, and also force to prostrate his foes, and destroy them, according to the letter heth, and also hee useeth Iadah, for thanking, that hee is never out of som signification, of som kinde of hand or other. Genesis: Gods name Iehovah is a rock, and everlasting, and his way perfect, and Da∣vid sticketh close to it, for his sole relye and quiescencey, and is rewarded. His enimyes are the sonnes of Belial ful of defect, and therfor are revenged. The deficients may appeer when they are made as small as dust in the winde, and as inestimable as dust or dirt, and when they trust not to their handes, but shrink from their holdes, so the reward of the one is the defeat of the other. PSALM XIX. WHen they professed themselves to be wise they became fooles. Men thought to describe the mysticall image and glory of God, by rotten creatures of the earth, when his eternall power and godhead is consi∣dered in his method and way of creation, and redemption. Which, becaus it is a way, so wonderfull, and so miraculous, and his salvation so great, so remar∣kable, and notable, and admirable, in the eyes of men, Ps. 118. for the infinit constancey of his word, and everlasting love and righteousnes of the Law, that it seemeth to shine beyond all thinges in the world: It is called the glory of God, and that great, Ps. 138. and hee the king of glory, Ps. 24. For his blessing and beames of righteousnes upon the church. And this is the reformation, and the new creation that the heavens and firma∣ment shew every day in the week, by renewing of knowledge over all the world. 1. The Law of God is perfect becaus it hath power of conversion, by shineing of the light therof round about us, 2. It is so credible a testimony and so faythfull as the heavens them∣selves, that the simple can beleeve it, and be instructed. 3. The provisos and statutes therof are very upright and plain, and delightfull for eminencey. 4. The commande∣ment is as pure as the Sunn, to make a man circumspect, and addeth light to the sight, and is good for the eyes. 5. The Fear and honour of God is a clean cariage of a man, by an undefiled religion, that remaineth for ever. 6. And all his work is don by true and right-judgement, that makes his sentencees most sweet and delightfull to a reformed creature, and to haue domination and approbation over all. Thus by imprinting the manifest justice of the Law, called the glory of God, in the certainty of the heavens and their courses, to all countryes intelligible, Ps. 119. ??is. And compareing the Law and the visita∣tion therof to the Sunn in all propertyes for his locks of heavenly knowledge, with a high estimation therof, for shewing him his way, Ps. 119. h, 149. and the knowledge of infinit transgressions: David prayeth for forgiuenes of all sortes of them, that in word and thought hee may bee uprighte with the eternall, and walk with God and keep an intire rest, in true holynes before him, and pleas him. From the creation, Gen. 1. And thus in six dayes, God hath made heaven and earth, &c. by illumination and confirmation of men in the true knowledge of him by his word, and bringing them to beleeve. And
heerby hee becommeth their father, their life and creator, their saviour and redeemer, that they may both know him and also the way to him: even Iesus Christ the true and liveing way, even the very way of life, Ps. 16. Every day is a degree of knowledge till wee com to a perfection and rest in the light and judgement of the Law: the true light and perfection, the Sabbath. when sinn reigneth not over us, but our Conscience is cleer and our words and thoughts pleas God. Construction. The letters make Iet, of Natah, to spred, Ps. 104. and to decline. and incline, and a place of lyeing down, a chamber &c. and it hath the spreading of the hea∣vens for his handy work, Ps. 104. For the Name of God, heer beeing might, impor∣teth hand. The heavens are full of variation, and yeld continuall knowledge, all the world over, wher the Sunn hath his chamber, Solisque cubilia Gades &c. his riseing and inclineing and declination and operation: so hee declineth the Law, and defineth the same; and his owne errors are for declinations. Genesis. In the Definition is all quiescencey: great riches, great sweetnes, great reward, great wisdom, great joy, great knowledge, and great purity, great warning: from which, considering his declineings, and divers defects: Hee would be purged of all; that hee might rest in the favour of God, his rock and stay, redemption, sole quiescency and rely, Ps. 18. and that the quiescence is in this word. Mark, that Iehova is seven times repeated, to stay you therupon, and upon the law; as the defection is in the declineing from it, and this is for a begining also. PSALME XX. LEt your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glo∣rify your father which is in heaven. Hee that honoureth father and mother more then mee, is not worthy of mee; and the honour of Parents is the ful∣filling of the Law and Commandements of God, Which is heer don by praying for the king: the preserver and defender therof. And this maketh the womb happy for bearing, and the paps for giving suck. Hee that in his distress calleth upon God; doth glorify God, and hee it is that shall be set in the way of Salvation, Ps. 50.91. and see his fill of dayes, with all contentment Ps. 21. And therfor, becaus the King is fa∣ther and mother in this sens, for fostering and mainteyning, as well as God and his Law, for creating: it may well be sayd, fear God and honour the King; for fear God and keep his Commandement, and honour thy father and mother, and hurt not thy neighbour, for an only religious and a devout man. Now with great devotion hee cryeth, God save the king, and prayeth for him. That God would honour him with all salvation, and giue him all his requests (hee glorifyeth God by calling upon him in distress) and that the Kings religious service of God may comfort and succour him in all distresses; that the whole church may sing, and display their coulours for his sal∣vation. With this conjecture and note of assureance therof, that the calling upon God standeth in more steed, and is more victorious to prolong his life and mainteine his in∣heritance, then Chariots and horses; as is seen. For the service of God is the honour∣ing of father and mother, and the calling vpon him, the onely help to prolong their dayes. And for this they bless the King, and pray for him; for the mainteining of a right ministry. Construction. The name of the letter being Caph, a hand; hee worketh upon all the propertyes: from holding, apprehending, or conceiving. The word Iagnan is made to hear, and this goeth through the Psalme, thrise used. Fortification, help, and upholding giveing, offering, and erecting, filling, all work of the hand; and the right hand for the Ministry. caph, also is to crouch. Genesis. The Quiescency, the staff, and stay, and salvation of the King is in the cal∣ling upon God, and remembring of his Name, as Psalm 18. therfor is Name so oft re∣peated also. Wherby they hold, abide, and stand upright, and haue their fill of harts ease, and rest, consultation and request fullfilled, with all contentment. The word salvation 4. times repeated, Which is a royall quiescencey, when the contrary trust, and all
vain confidence shall allwayes crouch, and haue defeat. So as the King standes by the Ministry: his salvation and safe standing, is in the perfection therof. The crouching which is another sens, of Caph and falling, is the signe of Deficiencey. the Vowells by the Grammarians, Elias and others: are called Kings; which may be sayd, to call upon the letters Iehova, for to them, the quiescents haue relation & respect also, and are for a re∣creation or restauration of mankinde. PSALM XXI. THe strongest hold lasteth longest, so the Kings dayes and inheritance is made everlasting, for sticking to the strength of the Ark of God, Ps. 68.59. and the life and righteousnes of the law that is in it. From whence hee hath his Dominion, and crown of Glory, and honour and worship, and all blessings that his hart or lips can desire, as Ps. 8.3. and is cheeed, and whet on, with the joy of his countenance, Ps. 4.41. That for his fayth and love to God; Gods loveing kinde∣denes shall lengthen his dayes a thousand generations, against all reproche, ps. 4. Highth and depth is not discerned a farr; no more is the hart of a king, by his people, that they should be angry with him. And becaus fooles bolts are soon shott, and easyly slay with reproche, Ps. 14.15. and put out his light, and extinguish his glory by Ignominy: Ps. 4. The Church willeth the King to bee glad, and rejoyce in God, and to bee thank∣full to the power of his Law and Love, for his Salvation. They pray, that Gods power, and his Ministry, called his right hand, may ever finde out all his Enimyes and them that hate him, by his Iealousy, and burn them with his firey presence, like a furnace. Ps. 58.83. and anger them with the opening of the word; and consume and devoure them, by laying the Scriptures before them, and makeing them as a butt to shoot at. And that God would bend the Scriptures at them, and aime at their face-es, to destroy them, to the third and fowerth Generation, for angring of him and his Anoynted: for endevouring and attempting evill against him, and diviseing mischeeff that they could never atchive; an Imagination impossible, to Kill him. That Gods strength may bee extolled, and his excellent power and virtue bee sung out in Psalmes, and commended. Thus hee thanketh God, for his mighty and unspeakable blessings upon the King; with a presumption that hee shall never bee stirred, becaus hee trusteth in the Eternall; who of his loveing kindenes defendeth them that trust in him, Ps. 18. and findeth out all his enimyes, and destroyeth them; that the church may haue matter to sing Praises and commendations of him; when the King is safe, and they are poseed or oppose-ed by the word of God, and as it wear, slayn by Objection. Construction. The letters are interpreted Caah or cavah to be obscure and dark, and troubled. First in the contrary sense, as of his countenance, that it be lightsom and to be in sight, thou hast set before him &c. makest him cheerfull before thee &c. at the time of thy presence, &c. a but &c. bend against thei faces &c. Cavah to burn. To make them black with wrath as a firey oven, & put them out of the sight of men and of the world by destruction, and obscure them. Such is the repetition of the sense and words also to make it cleer. Genesis. His Glory, and honour and worship, and prosperity, and length of dayes; beeing all that hee can desire, is. The Kings quiescency, Ioy and delight is in the Confi∣dence and preservation of the Eternall without defect, let the King rejoyce in thy strength, &c. And seeing hee trusteth in the Eternall, &c. Bee thou exalted in thy Strength, O Eternall &c: and for Constancey: put them as a crown &c. thou puttest upon him &c. Set them as a firey Oven &c: Set them as a butt which is to plant fast, and so oft repeated. that whether for the quiescent or Defective it be firm. The constancey of the Letters of Jehova or Ehevi the letters of the quiescents, is great delight and orna∣ment to vowels that call on them. PSALM XXII. IN the last Ps. 21. the King by trusting confidently in the eternall and the supremacey of godlines and excellencey of the promiss, Ps. 138. And soveraignty and way of
love; is sure of salvation. And this is his signe, his keeping himself undefile-ed in religion. His keeping of Gods word and not denyeing his name, and holding his fayth. Now Salomon sayth the way of God is strength to the upright man, like a Ps. 18. and so may the King well delight in his salvation, Ps. 24. hee that looseth his fayh loo∣seth his strength. And this strength, in this Psalme is called the morning strength, or strength of youth, the strength of the Law of God and way of godlynes. Which as the adulterers bestow the same upon the harlot and strange woman: so they that revolt from it, are called adulterers, and make the members of righteousnes the mēbers of an harlot, Ps. 73. and this is the matter of Davids complaint in this Psalme. That God hath left off saveing of him, cry hee never so sore, and his strength fayleth, Psal. 71. and why hee should not be saved by his faith, as well as the fathers of the church before him, like Hebr. 11. seeing his trust was upon God from his mothers brest, and had no other suc∣cour, but was wholeley cast upon him all his life. And why hee receiveth all reproche in the world, while they are highly commended: that his trust was so notable, that hee suf∣fered all kinde of floutes, and mocks, and skorn for the same. His adversity is: the terri∣blest enimyes set upon him in the terriblest manner, and hee is as a man without any strength, and like a dead man, Psal. 88.71. with neither courage nor strength to save himself, or face to look upon them. But is like water spilt on the ground, of no strength, quite lost and undon, his bones hang not together, his hart is molten, his marrow is dryed, and his tong cleaves to his Iawes, and that God hath even turned him to dust. They tear him in peeces and quarter him, like dogs and lions, that hee may see his bones in their mouthes, by their looks upon him, and his clothes di∣vide-ed among them. Now that hee hath made himself so strengthless, so helpless, so vile in Name, and so sore in affliction, that of all men hee saw himself moste contempti∣ble, and his distresses so nigh: hee prayeth to add continuall presence and favour and his speedy might again to deliver him and save him. That hee and all that fear God, the seed of Iacob and Israel, may declare and praise his name in the church, and glorifye him, and stand in aw of him for his grace and countenance and attendance to the humble and aflicted; and they that seek God, may feed upon his doctrine with full contentment, and refresh their hartes for ever: that the ends of all the earth may therby, bee converted and haue minde to com to God, and Iaphet may dwell in the tents of Sem. And becaus the Kingdom and rule of all nations is Gods: that all the fanilyes of the Hethen may bow down and worship before him; yea the miserable soules that haue no life in them; and are going to their grave: may be fed and bow down and worship like him. That the gentiles may com in, to prais God and serve him, and be counted for his children; and declare his Iustice, and tell what things hee hath don, to all that shall be born heerafter. The summ af all is this, that seeing hee was cast upon the Eternall from his birth, and hath had no friend but God in al his life; hee that for deliverances had all the praises of Israel, and that hee hath committed no aduletry that way, Ps. 73. now in extreame distress, hee prayeth for speedy comfort, and not to bee cast off, that hee may also prayse God, and so that all people may be fed with his doctrine, that even the very hethen may admire it, and worship the eternall for his infinite Kingdom, and likewise becom his childeren to prais him. That God leaveth not his servant, in any low estate, nor despiseth them for any af∣fliction, nor turneth at any time from his servants and children that turn not from him. his servants beeing counted for his children and generation, that all sortes should seek him, and not for any affliction change their God, seeing hee is King of all nations. Construction. The letters are to extinguish, or put out from Cabha, or to bee extin∣guished, as the seed of the godly, shall never bee. This is seen in repetition of the word seed of Iacob, the seed of Israel the Seed that serveth the Lord and feareth the Eternall, shall be an everlasting posterity and no affliction or adversity shall extinguish it. That feed upon the word and adore the Eternall. Thes words also are repeted, as caph, to bow arang, outcasts and afflicted, Dust, Ashes, aged, feeble, all degrees and kindes of extincts. His misery can not extinguish him, becaus the unquenchable spirit of the word comforts him. Caph, a hand, for might, beth, for be, ezra helping be) as the grammarians call, and this sense and wordes is three times repeated. Far from may help, be not far, whē distress is nigh, and I haue no helper, Ps. 32. Is. 58. and ô Eternall my might make hast to my help,
as goe the letters, so goe their allusions together, easy to be marked. Genesis: The mighty God hath left him helpless, and is far off, and the just God heareth him not, for all his calling. Though the fathers triumphed in his deliverance. But hee hath his delight in the mercyfull Eternall, upon their faith and cryeing to him. Their quiescency is their faith, his quiescencey is in his fayth in the Eternal, and his King∣dom, in the help of God. The token therof is in El & Ejaloth. For might, the same word in a double forme; perfect and imperfect, and the words of delivering often repeated, and fayth, the means of help, be gnezra ha El, by the help of God. Hee is delighted with the in∣vocation upon the Eternall, Ps. 14. which also is a reformation of man. PSALM XXIII. WHen God is sheepheard, then is the church the flock, Psal. 80. and the scriptures and word of God, the pasture, hee that in this Psalme is sheepheard, in the last and in the Psalme following, is King, as you see. Heer in, David findeth such refreshing and releeft in distresses, that hee reckoneth himself heerby, to abound, to be strong and rich, in all want, and poverty, and persecution what soever, that hee hath ever stusteined him, that hee need not despaire: for hee wanteth nothing that is good, Ps. 37. Now becaus ingratitude is a theevery, and not to restore, as great a stealth as taking by force: and hee hath received heerin, and heerby, the highst blessings that can bee: and that they have been his guide, his meat, his drink, his companion, his feast, his anoyntment, his mirth, his peace, and plenty, in darck and cloudy times of adversity, and that in the sight of his persecutors: and hath still brought him through, for his own names sake, and to shew the power and strength of his word, as in Psal. 22. and therfor from hence hee getteth this resolution of thankfullnes, lest hee should seem to haue any thing that hee did not requite or pay for, which wear stealth. And becaus hee was so much bound unto God for his great bounty and love, all his life long, for the true service of him; hee will bee his true servant to his lives end. And so, seeing by following the doctrine of the Law of God; called the green feeld, and the quiet wates, hee wanteth nothing, his minde is converted, and himself guided the right way to all blessednes of this life; and seeing in all doubtfull cases, hee hath great comfort and boldnes therby: hee resolveth to continue in the contemplation therof for ever. And this for one part of the way of God, P, 25. Construction: Caph, a hand, wherby hee leadeth him, and guideth like a sheep, Psal. 77.78. by repetition of the sense in divers words to that purpose, leadeth, converteth, guideth. The office of a shephard. Ciph, a cliff or cave, which to a sheep is by nature most fearfull, also any dark passage. The third part is from Ghimel, to reward or waine. As a sheep heard is a pastor or feeder: so heer hee maketh him awaynlings feast, as Gen. 21. and hee was ever favourable to him. That was his reward, as Ps. 62. Prov. 31. Genesis. His quiescency is the doctrine of the ministry, as Noah walked with God and found favour in his sight, Gen. 6. so hee is no way deficient, but for lodgeing, cours, directiō and diet, is about him, by him, before him, and after him, with all consolation, and comforts, and graces? Hee aboundeth, by daylye feeding on the word. The quiescents are full in many words, to be marked, so hee is begotten and reformed by grace. PSALM XXIV. THe last Psalme 23, was of the excellent Love and kindenes of God unto his faithfull servantes, and this of the truth and faithfullnes of his word, to them that loue him; unite-ed in the next psalme 25. for the whole way of God. The maner of the creation argueth and truely testifieth the Creator: so the workes of a man be found to signify the hart, then yf the hart bee pure and clean: the testimony is good and true. Hee that hath neither wrought with his hands, nor thought wrong in his hart: a man that is true and faithfull and just with his tongue, and is not given to fals∣hood, dissembling and deceipt: hee it is, that shall bee blessed of God and receiue the
crown of righteousnes and salvation Ps. 4.133.134. And thes are they that follow the Lamb. Apo. 19. Seeing this same and such was the very protestation of the Iewes and srvantes of God, and the church, which mightily excelled all nations, for pureity of profession and religion; as Ps, 47. hee sheweth, that their Testimony is moste neigh∣bourly, and moste Iustifiable before God; and that all religion beside this, did tstfy falsshood, and was moste damnable to all. Therfor seeing in this Psalme, Religion is made a true protestation, or protestation of the truth, or verification, or justification, or truth it self: and faith and strength: Ps. 22. and illumination of the Law of God and glory of all men: Ps. 4. and that the God of this religion beeing truth, that rideeth on a white hors and fighteth valiantly, the written verity, and righteousnes, that excelleth in strength and victory, and is a mighty warrier: and the people of the Iewes and seed of Iacob the protestants therof: and becaus their religion and profession shone beyond all men, for Glory, which is righteousnes: Ps: 4. Therfor the Prophet maketh procla∣mation therof, and cryeth room for them, before all men, and all enteraniment and preferment to be given them, in all hollynes. Aeternaque ferri robera &c: the everlasting gates to be set open for them; Which without all question or doubt, for glory, are the cheeffest; and their God, the King of Glory. This is a pure and undefiled religion, free of all filthy conversation, wherby a man may live unspotted in the world, and unsteined of men. Construction. Caph the sole of the foot, and that in thes words, who shall goe up and who shall stand, beeing the office and property of the feet, as Ios. 3. Caph a hand: by innocent handes, which hee interprets the purity and syncerity of the Minde, and also the office, which is to take or receiue, as in Nasa repeated. Daleth a doore or gate often, as open your cheeffe gates, set up your mighty doores &c. This was the gate of the Eternall and the Princes only: the east gate of the temple Eze. 44. that never was to be opened, but for them. Ps. 118. Genesis. The quiescents, the letters Ehevi, mentioned in Chi how and mi how. And the letters Iehova are the replenishing of words, beeing written, as the Massorets call them. Which is the generall domination of them, in the perfection of wrighting. Hee that is not defect in his devotion, shall receive full quiescencey and content. Thee only haue I seen righteous, in this generation. Gen. 6. The syncere shall entertaine the king∣dom of glory, the Kingdom of Righteousnes & bee exalted, dwell with God and rest with him. Thou art my beloved sonn, in thee I am well pleased. The quiescency is entertainment, and that is signifyed in Nasa, diversly taken, and Bo, diversly written. bothe full and defect, with a quiescent and without, called nah nirce and nah nister a quiescent seen, and unseen, written and not written. mark the repetition. PSALM. XXV. TO dash all worldly covetousnes, which is the root of all evill and the net of all intanglements, the witchery of all transgression and breach of all the Com∣mandements, by the wickednes of the minde and liquorishnes of Imagina∣tion: he sheweth that his whole minde is set upon God, and the way of God∣lynes, which is his faith and truth, and love; as Ps. 23.24. that his trust and whole relye is upon him, and that all his hope and expectation is in him, and all his waiting for him, and all his covet is his Law: Ps. 115. and all his honour & riches and glory and strength & delighte is God. And that hee may not fail of his direction heerin: that his minde is not set upon gain, but to the Law of God, Ps. 119. h. becaus Gods minde and promiss, and covenant, is to teach all them that will obserue his word, and to make the humble and meek moste learned therin; and to set them well at es, and make them heires of the Land. Now when a multitude of enimyes haue a moste unjust hatred to him, and distresses very many and great are befallen him, and his affliction and greeff exceeding much, for his sinnes: hee prayeth, that for his dayly expectance, hee bee not deceived, nor ashamed of his hope; but as his eyes are allwayes upon him, that God will teach him the right way of salvation, through his truhe and everlasting mer∣cyes
and kindenesses to him. Ps. 143. That hee would forgiue the sinnes of his youth; and pardon his extreame iniquity, that hee would rid him out all torments and paines of minde, and bring his feet out of this net, and saue his life, and deliver him: and pitty him for his great desolation and affliction. And seing the Eternall, in his upright∣nes, is to teach sinners and them that fear him his wayes, accoding to his covenant to them: Ps. 1. to wit, Loveing kindenes and faythfullnes, Ps: 117, to the keepers of his Covenants and Testimonyes: hee prayeth for instruction therin in an ABC facion, (becaus it is the beginning of wisedom) that so both hee, and the Church may finde both forgivenes of sinnes and deliverances out of all distrsses; considering his and their sound trust and waiting upon him. that hee and they goe not away abashed therof, Ps. 129 but hat they all bee confounded that wickedly and vainly transgress. Construction. The letters Cah of Cahah, is to be dark or blinde. Heerto hee op∣poseth waiting. Concerniing the one, hee speaketh all for directon, and for he other, all for Pardon; lest sinn take away his sight, and make his expectation blinde. And all his confidence vain. The comming so oft round of the wordes will assure the sense. and the letters Quoph and vau, which spelled together doe signify to wait: are not in the Rew therfor, but wait. Genesis. To open thes everlasting gates of the ABC, his Doctrine heer is, the letters begad cephath with dagesh and Raphe. From hence, hee draweth sin, and affliction, and forgivns, Vav is exempted, for his crookednes, as in L, to signify cephath, crookednes, the one forme of the finals, bash them in the entance, by the resounding of the term Albash, that are pervers and revolting. for dagesh, the strictnes of his misery, for Ra∣phe, that is remission. By thes wordes, see mine Affliction, &c. And forgiue; see mine Enimyes, in R. pardon mine iniquity; in L. wher Vav is reviveed, but out of cours, that hee might be marked. And as crookednes is abandoned, so in them; and hee prayeth that straitenes, and uprightnes, and simple purity may preserve him; and that to be the way of redemption, by pe peshutah. or p finale. In this Psalme, hee personats the church, so that the net is the Captivity. Now for a finall redemption from all ad∣versity: between pe cephuphah and pe peshutah in the ABC, a certain term is sett, tsarar, that spelleth 490 which is Tsarar the afflictor; to shew how long the Afflctors and perse∣cutors could raigne: in doubling of resh to tsade and skipping of Quoph even 70. sevens of yeers, Dan: 9. the Angel Gabriels knowledge, dureing many generations. Seven fold the misery of the Church, Ps. 8.6. The sevenfold adversity to all Gods Enimyes. Ier: 25. This number is made by multiplication of zain by gnain. the one beeing made a principall, by exemption of Vav, and the other finall, by doubling of Pe. Ps. 34. Sinn makes all sorrow, so an enimye lasteth long, and ther must be long waiting, and much patience. The same summe maketh just the space fō Sauls reigne to the captivity, while the wicked keep the rew the Iust must wait & want a room. Vau is left out, for it signi∣fyeth a hook or crook, to hold, as captivity, and this psalm is for deliverance or redemp∣tion, the contrary. Ps. 37. the summ. 490. is also found in the word shequets, Abo∣mination: spoken of, Dan. 9. Matth. 24. that is a mark of the end of that dealeing, and foresheweth the desolation. PSALM XXVI ALL this haue I don. As the yong man in the Gospell, so David in this Psalme setteth out plainly what manner of man hee is, as touching the rule and Law prescribe-ed in the former Psalme; measuing himself, and his cariage, and conversation throughly, by the line therof. And therby, looking upon him∣self as in a glass, and approoving his image and feature of Godlynes: presumeeth to offer him self unto God, for a faithfull, and a just, and an intire man, wholely dedi∣cate-ed unto him. First According unto Ps. 15. for the first commandement, hee wal∣keth the perfect-way of Godlynes, and it is ever before him. Ps. 25. and this signifyeth his Thummim, and perfection, as must be noteed in the first and last verses. 2. hee abides not any falsifyers, counterfeiters or dissembling hypocrites, but abhorreth all gra∣ven
graven imagination besides the Law of God. 3. also hee hateth all wicked company, and the seat and assembly of ill and guilty comunication; shewing that all comuni∣cation, and conference, and society of the wicked is faulty before God: 4. That hee is a most precise keeper of the sabbath, throughout the whole service of God; in all pre∣paration, behaviour, repaire and diligence, in all the exercise of hearing, and preaching, and love and affection to his house. 5. Therfor, that hee would not end his life and abridge, his dayes, and shorten his time with the time of sinners and disobeyers of pa∣rents and all governement. 6 And men of bloody thoughtes and murtherers. 7. & 8. that hee is free from all whoorish theft and rapine 9. & 10. And that his dayes, be not shortened with those that love rewardes and swear falsly, becaus hee walketh moste in∣tirely: moste uprightly and neighbourly in all things: that hee may still remain in the righteous congregations, still praysing and blessing the Eternall uprightely. And this is his confidence that hee slip not, and his staff that hee fall not. And thus hee putteth himself to triall before God, for his curious observation, according to all termes and pointes of Eternity and happines propounded, Ps. 1. And this plainly for his integrity, his Thummim, and infallible confidēce in the Eternall, and walking in his ways, and his love of his house and service: hee prayeth for exemption. That hee may haue nothing to doe with any such, nor lead his life with the un-even dealers of the world, nor be coun∣ted in the number of them, that break the Law; that hee may stand upon even ground in the way of happines, and be throughly blessed, Ps. 1.119. a, blessing God in his church, Lev. 8. Deut. 33. For the walking with God, Gen. 6. Constructiō. Vpon Caph. for the sole of the foot, hee sheweth wher hee setteth his foot, and how, his whole conversation and behaviour, hee stands in faith and a sound con∣science, and this hee maketh sound footing, and plain ground, and good company and good excercise, sure stāding. The first and last verses shew by the words, walking, slipping feet, and standing in uprightnes, according to the end of the last Psalme. Likewise Caph, a hand, for his innocency, Vau, for his company, loveing and hateing, signifyed by the preposition with: as it may as well be sayd with, as and. Genesis. Caph Dimjon, in grammer, signifyeth likenes and resemblance, so hee maketh himself wholely to differ from the wicked. Vau, which is. And, the conjuncttion copu∣lative, with them Vau hibbur, grounds the society. As beged cephath, or the Ephod is joy∣ned to the brest-plate or Thummim, Exod. 28.29.39. For this precise life intendeth the priestly attendance, and therfor hee alludes to the ornament. PSALM. XXVII. FLesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee. The Scriptures and word of God haue great use in this life and that to com, for teaching, improoving, and correcting, and for instructing in righteousnes, that the man of God may be, ab∣solute, and perfect in all good workes, they so plainly testifying of God, by whose light wee do see light, Ps. 36. and obtein fayth, and strength and courage in the hart, as Ps. 10. & by continuall waiting, exaltation, as Ps. 40. And for this is the promiss, that godlynes is profitable unto all things, and hath everlasting life. God is not literall but spirituall, and the mystery and hidden secrets of godlynes very great, and the highe roomes of salvation are by revelation. The power and esticacy of the Scriptures standeth in spirituall interpretation and divineing of the word, and in revelations, and the extraction of the letter: the spirit and life of the word, which made and revealed all thinges. And thus overliveth Abrahams God, thus is David a man conformable to Gods own hart, and Christ is, the ingraven forme of his father, and speaketh all by authority. And this hee calleth his reviveing, and all his stay of life and salvation. So David beeing fosaken of the world and in great distress; by the Law, called the light of the Eternall, or his vrim, his stay of life, and salvation: hee is out of all fear, so hee may bee in he service of God. And prayeth for right direction, and maketh request for it, and to see the face of the Eternall, which is his Law, his plesantnes, as Psal. 16. to be allwayes conversant with him. That hee may be exalted over his enimyes, and hee may prase God, which hee is
confident to see, er hee dye, by his valiant waiting on the Eternall, Lev. 8. Deut. 33. by his faith & confidence in his illumination in the promisses, by his seeking the face and presence of God, in performance according to the Law, and covenant, Ps. 24. Construction. The letter Caph, a hand, is heer taken to cover, as Exod. 33. which is the contrary to relevation by the Vrim, light and judgement, yet this beeing God his hand and his direction, it is taken proper, for his covering and protection, for hee feareth no∣thing, yf hee have that about him, which must onely be in time of priestly function; in the moste holy place, and then hee is sure to be safe. The words, hideing, keeping close, the rock, &c. shew, the same. Zain is to hear or attend, as in the words, hearing see∣king his face: begging for attendance, and his faithfull waiting, twise commanded, which doth now intimate the promiss. which will strengthen the hart, as it is the strength of the Law. Genesis. From the fortitude of Dages, which liveth by the quiescents in Iehova, and despiseth his enimyes the gutturals: ach ragnab, and resh, the brother of malice, or malici∣ous ones and all their attempts against him. When naughty men, &c. The strength of his faith is devised heerupon, and the enimnity of the gutturals and resh is, becaus they receiue no dages and differ in vowels: so that they walk irregular, and by & crooked wayes (say the Grammarians) and not according to the rule of Dagesforte or graue. For this he prayeth, that hee may not satisfy their appetit; or be eaten up and consumed by them, by their wrong voweling: when injury breatheth, &c. and fals witnesses or wrong ponunciation ariseth. But that hee may allwayes be taught and led the right rule of Grammer, to be holpen, and save-ed from his ennemyes. A sound judgement or a good brestplate revealeth the face of God, which is all his will, as Vrim is worn on the brest∣plate. This maketh a constant waiting and a sure fayth in the promisses. The Abce are the parents of Dages, though som letters fosake him: yet justice and regularity shall pre∣serve him. For all, consider the doubling of words, the repeating of phrases, the inti∣mation of the sense throughout. PSALM XXVIII. YEe err not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of them; beeing ignorant of the works of God, and the deedes of his hands: and yee cannot bee edifyed therby, but be destroyed, defaceed & abase-ed, and deprived of that litle yee have, for want of knowledge, which is the rock of the Church, and the founda∣tion therof; even Christ with the Hoste of Israel, that feedes and succours them, susteynes them and supports them for ever. For without the foundation of knowledge, can bee no edification and building up of a faythfull and a perfect man, but men continue graceless even as the dumb beastes, Ps. 49. Now that hee hath obteined knowledge and understanding sufficient, and revelations from heaven: and the heavens be opened to him as Psal. 26.27. And that hee is perfect in the operation of the word of God; and know∣eth well what the work of God meaneth: and is much delighted with the confidence, and protection hee hath gotten therby: and haveing had his particular request in Psal. 26, for which hee blessed the Eternall: to wit, for his own safety and edification by his integrity in the word of God, and the just destruction of th wicked that neither doe nor understand the same; but follow their imaginations: hee thanketh God, and prayeth for the salvation and edification of his people, Ps. 147. and the whole church and inheri∣tance of God, that they may likewise be well fed and susteyned with doctrine for ever, the rock, Exod. 17. Num. 20. 1. Cor. 10. Gods holy oracle; that yelded waters abun∣dantly, of wholsom doctrine to thirsty soules, that beleeved strongly the promiss to be performed and the Law to be given, after 430. yeers. Construction. Heer Caph, or Kiph, is for a rock, and that hee makes the Eternall, as Ps. 18. Also Caph, a hand, Cheth, to destroy and not to build: and both the letters to∣gether; as Choach; virtue, faculty, might, help or strength, hee cometh in to the holyest and smite-eth the Rock, with invocation and petition at the holy word, the oracle: in his Ephod, or shield of fayth, his rock, and hath his request, his great consolation which hee
wisheth his people for ever. From wence is all salvation. Heer they knock for all that they want. Actu & potentia. workes for power, as effects so strength. Genesis. Between the Quiescents and the gutturall letters ther is great variance: such hee maketh between wicked and spirituall men. The one sort calles upon the Eternall, becaus the letters Ehevi, are in the name of the Eternall, the other abide not the same, Ps. 14. The vowels of the one, beeing long, the other, short and irregular. The signifi∣cation of the gutturalls is, that they speak peacebley and freendly with their neighbours, when they yet doe malice them, and this is the way to swallow them, as Ps. 5.14. what way the guiescents take, in Grammer, the Gutturalls take not the same. Dagesh forte belongs to the one, the other will no dagesh at all. and for this corruption, the Guttu∣ralls perish & haue their reward, and by the power of the Eternall, the Quiescents are preserved. Peace and silence &c. note the quiescents. PSALM XXIX THe word of God is mighty in operation: it divideth between the marrow, and the bone. Out of the light of salvation, Ps. 27. and knowledge in the Law of God, riseth admirable glory and mighty confidence, for edification and suste∣nance in the spirit, as Ps. 28. That the glory and power therof may be moste fa∣mous, as Ps. 76. wher the very sound therof breaketh the weapons, and maketh an end of the warr: by the chideing of the moste high, in his dwelling place and sanctuary, Salem & Zion. For exceeding lustre and strength heerof, it is called a Kingdom, as Ps. 143.144.145. and heer therfore, the effect therof is called a King, and God of glory, to raigne for ever, as Ps. 24.19. And this is for the voice and spirit of the word it self, and possession of the Scriptures, called the waters and the great waters, and the flood, which hee occu∣pyeth with such majesty, and such commande, with such aflonishment of Doctrine, such terror to the Princes, and tossing of the mountaines, the Cedars and Lebanon and all the lofty ones; setting their hartes and all the woodes on fire, as in Cadesh, and to tremble, with great greeft, makeing all things naked, and revealing of all secrets, discovering of al hartes, and greeving the great deer of the forrest, for want of cover. And becaus hee so shineth in his temple, and so disquieteth his Enimyes, and giveth his people such blessing of strength & peace, beyond the power of all Gods; that hee willeth all Gods and prin∣ces, and mighty and godly men, the children of the Gods, and Ministers, to ascribe all power and glory to him for ever: the glory of his name, with all humility, in his de∣cent sanctuary. So for the might and majesty of Gods word in the Scriptures, called the waters, Ps. 68.150. and his thundring out, of his miraculous Acts therin, that plague the great kings in the wildernes of Zin, in Cadesh, 38. yeers, by the firey flames of the Law, and becaus all that hee speaketh in his temple is glory, and becaus the Eternalls throne is upon the flood therof, wher hee sitteth ever king, and giveth strength, end peace to his people as Psal. 93.147. hee wisheth all glory and strength to be ascribed to the Eternall and his name, as Ps. 96. and great worship in his sanctuary. Construction. Caph, a hand, yeeld or give, ascribe or offer. Caph to bow, bend or wor∣ship, for adoration and oblation of the Priests and Ministers. Caphah, a branch, when the trees be all shivered and the woods made all bare of boughes, Iob. 15. Exod. 9. Tet, of Tete, to sweep away all, Isai. 14. and this by the moste terrible Meteors, to shew the force and fiercenes of the word of God. Therfor that they should yeeld him the glory of calling upon him, with all glory. Genesis. The quiescency is in Iehova, that mastereth the watrs, as Noah in the Ark. The double doctrine of Dagesh, in begad cepheth, to be woren in the Ephod, one kinde of Dagesh, on the one shoulder, and the other, on the other, by thes wordes, yeeld &c. glory and strength, Dagesh tiphereth, and dagesh chazak, they must adore with decency. The voice &c. is with might and with majesty. The glorious giving of the Law in mount Sina, called the waters, Exod. 19. Deut. 5. the strength and quiescency of his church, to make his name and the calling upon him, moste glorious. Iehova, or Hovah, Isai. 47. by calamities and comfort. Hee tells Iehevah 18 times over, and El
twise, to shew the weight and glory of his name Jah, which make 20. Mark the repetition. PSALM. XXX. HEE that ascended is hee that descended first into the lower parts of the earth. In the eighteenth Psalme, David was baptised in trouble, and in the nine∣teenth, born by the word, and made the childe of God by reformation, and from thence strengthened and confirmed by his Name, for which hee giveth all glory to God. And in this Psalme hee is received to glory, the greatest glory of God beeing his resurrection. Before the loss of the Ark, David was but over shooes and wetshod in affliction, yet hee made his recovery great, and his deliverance miraculous; but now, hee is up to the neeck, yea over head and eares in hevynes, when hee hath lost his charge, his strength and ornament and salvation. So that hee meaneth heer an infinit magnifying of God for his resurrection out of such a sorrow, beeing as a poor ship wract man of all his confidence. For ther is no descent so low as into a mans enimyes hands, and no captivity so miserable, or any misery so greevous as the whole Churches, to a Defendour, as is seen by Moses. And haveing lost a sure estate, and feeling the horror of Gods wrath and destruction, and fallen in this terrible pit of distresses and affliction, as seeing no way but death before him; and considering well, that there would com no profit by the death of a poor and wreched sinner, but rather by his con∣version: and considering that God is not for ever angry, as Ps. 77. and that there is Ioy and life to bee in Gods favour and likeing, Ps. 34. hee turneth wholely to God for help, and cryeth out of this great deep, for redemption and forgivenes, as Ps. 130. and obteineth to bee remitted, and salved, raised again and quickned, that hee may sing and dance for joy; and that his own Glory may for ever prais him, for this shifting of him out of such miserable and sinfull corruption, into such a glorious liberty again. That hee ought for ever to worship him, and Say, Death, wher is thy sting. and hell wher is thy victory? And for this hee so mightily extolleth God. And as all the starrs in heaven differ in glory: so the greatest glory in mans profession and protestation of religion, is his resurrection from base corruption. And therfor, that ther is no way in heaven or earth, to extoll it, or thank him worthyly. And this much for his dedication. 2. Sam. 5.6. Construction.

From whence, S. Mathew hath the children of the Kingdom, which should be the children of light: shall becom utterly ignorant, by term, utter Darknes and sorrow. Which is nothing but the state of Ignorance, Math: 8. When God hideth his face and his glory shineth not, and the Scriptures are not cleer. For this hee prayeth for illumination, and his glory, to worship a right, which is the brightnes of lerning, to declare the truth. His heavynes and his reviveing, is from his God eternall, Iehovah his virtuous remedy of Compassion, marck the office of Lamed for rarity, by repeating the words, Chaunt unto the Eternall. That Glory may chaunt thee out &c. For the lerned priestes, Gods holy ones and gracious ministers. Is. 42. the grace of Doctrine, beeing a lively and a lightsom thing, as ignorance is wrath∣full and horrible. Genesis. Dagesh tephereth, Dagesh of glory, in beged cepet and Raphe. As in thes wordes: that Glory may chaunt thee &c. And in thes words, thou didst heale, Tirpaeni. Which Dagesh, is used for sweetnes of sound in the oration, and this Dagesh is only, in six letters dagesht, and six undagesht, according to the six tribes on either shoulder of the Ephod, wherin the priest was to Minister.
PSALM XXXI. HAveing seen the goodnes of the Eternal wich hee trusted verily to see; as Ps. 27. To wit, his wonderfull kindenes, that hee was at liberty among his E∣nimyes, and that in a strange and strict citty (Gath) and sheweth the benefit therof, and teacheth it, as in Psalm 34. A B C. by his valiant waiting, who giveth thanks for his deliverance, for fearing the Eternall: and that hee was not cutt off from the sight of God: but had his request, to inioye his service, Now in great perplexity by his fals accusers, and beeing mightily broken through ini∣quity, for their privy plotting for his life; by all manner of false reportes and violence; hee prayeth for his own deliverance, by this Argument, first by the righteousnes of the Eternall, and for his Name, righteousnes sake, which should lead, and guide him, aright to salvation. Secondly, to the Eternall, his strength, his fort and Garison, be∣caus hee commended and committed his life into his handes, with his whole trust and rely upon him. And thirdly, that the Eternall was a God of truth, and that hee could not abide vain falshood, but did put his trust only in the Eternall. And against his Eni∣myes thus: that all arrogant, fals, lofty, proud and spitefull speakers against the Iust may haue an everlasting silence below, and be dumb in the ground. And seeing thes are the just rewards of the Eternall: hee comforteth them that wait on him, in hope that hee shall never be ashamed therof. shewing in this Psalm, what is his whole rely and confidence, what is his Rock and Garison, and fayth and beleeff, and the first Ar∣ticle of his Creed: even to beleeve in the truthe, the Word, Ps. 120, 45. the God and power therof. And to trust therin for Salvation, and to committ him self wholy therto: to bee redeemed by the knowledge of the Law, and confidently trusting to work out his salvation, by the obseruing therof. And this is that which maketh him fayth full and patient, and long suffering, and constant, and not faint in distersses, and mi∣seryes, but to be of good cheer, and of good comfort, becaus God will strengthen their hartes with his Goodnes.

Math. 16. This is the spirituall rock that refreshed the whole campe, which rock was Christ 1 Cor. 10. &c. The brest plate of righteousnes that imboldned him, Ephes. 1. as is seen by the doubling of thes wordes: relying, trusting and committing of him self in all kinde of distresses. This is formed from, Exod. 33. wher it is called Gods presence, favour, goodnes, and glory, and rock, and safety by using the same termes as after a perfet mo∣dell. also for Lo of Laah, to be dissolved, and deficient, as hee was. Genesis. The term, hiemanti in grammer, to beleeve.

HAveing felt the hevy hand of God upon him, and the parching of his wrath, by his trobles fo all his trespass, sinn, deceipt and iniquity, which letted his Prayer, and the happines of his forgivenes, Ps. 65. After his confession and prayer to him: hee counselleth the Godly to pray in time, and conve∣niently, left, in time of inundation of trobles (called waters) Ps. 120. they finde impediment and harder entertainment. And for this caus hee prayeth to his Defence,
the Eternall for preservation from Distress, and to bee regarded by the Eternall, his righteousnes, for direction and righteousnes. Who answereth: yf they bee not Asses, and will understand, his Eye shall tend him and teach him his way. And wher sorrows be∣long to the wicked: his loveing kindenes shall inviron him about. If you haue ten thou∣sand Instructors, yet you haue but one father, and who can forgiue sinns but God only? even the Allsufficient father of instruction. The Law that bindeth and looseth, saveth and condemneth? The ever wakeing Eye of the Law shall tend them, and advise them and teach them & instruct them. So they bee not like Asses, and dull headed, and ex∣cept they will not lend their eares to understanding: that for acknowledgeing their sinns, they may be forgiven, remitted and saved. And thus by fayth are the righteous saved and blessed; from the Mercy seat, Exod. 25, 26, 27. In judgement remember Mercy: wher Iudgement is expressed by the hevynes of Gods hand, as love covereth a multitude of sinns. S. Pauls rule. So at the Mercy seat, Attonement and reconciliation was to be made for all. As Lev. 16. after confession. The Mystery, whose sinns are covered and condemnations wipeed out, from kipporeth, which is to cover, or a Cove∣ring, by all allusion. As the mercy seat is over the Ark, and Mercy rejoyceth over Iudgement, and loveing kindenes shall be round about a faythfull man, and they that cry for Mercy heer, shall be rescued and let escape damnation, as the goat &c. Lev. 16. From hence was Moses admonished Num. 7. Construction. Lamed, lerned. Lerning is still a guard to a wise man, to keep him from sinn. And what a great felcity is it, to be found faultless or cleered by the word of God? to beware of trespass and to see the way to Grace. I will wise &c. Beth is a house, by his hideing and preserving; or protection, for favour and kindenes, the walles of Salvation, the good Edification that is dayly about the Iust. So the tractable are edifyed, and the submissive and the gentle, well indued: but the froward hamperd, & are kirbed, Psal. 18. As the letters Lamed & beth are first over the Psalme, so are they the last, signifying the hart: Wher all crosses and comfort meet, wher sinn har∣boureth, wher grace entreth, faith & repentance worketh, and amendment groweth confession and all plainenes issueth, and remission commeth, and all salvation and joy, and happines and triumph followeth. Genesis. The Retoricall Accent, Metheg, a bridle, is used, compared to the Law, to check the froward and to pardon the penitent, the happy estate of remission to the refreiners, the great grace of continence, as Metheg is to the word, for sweetnes: and especially for distance: and Gaja for roaring and crying, as the prince of Accents. Is. 55. Ps. 22. All language is doltish and senseles without the Melody of time, and quantity in syllabes and pointes, and stops in Oration: according to all degrees of Decli∣nation, in the sentence. Ther is no trespass but against righteousnes, the virtue of the Eternall: and ther is no forgevines but from the God therof, nor happynes, nor joy but to trust in him, and indevour it. PSALME XXXIII. NOw hee willeth all the just to triumph royally, for the certainty and effect of Gods word, which hee fully-ly describe-eth, & the happines of the Nation that are the Eternalls inheritance. And for that in all the Scriptures, called the heavens, and his dwelling seat (from whence hee hath his prospect) which are formed to the hartes of all men, no salvation is found to haue been, by great Armys of Kings, or strength of men and horses, as Psal. 147. but by the vigilancey and care of the Eternall, in his Law (called his Eye) to deliver and releeve them that fear him: and be∣cause their Soul waiteth upon the Eternall, whom they make their sole defence; and de∣light and trust in him: hee craveeth the like mercy upon the whole Church, as their hope is in him. Now seeing the counsell of Gods word, passeth the counsell and all conceipt of the heathen, for creating, and reforming of mankinde, and bringing them to knowledge: that they may bee strong in fayth, and of a sound hope unto salvation, and that instruction is a new Creation: hee willeth a sabath of praise and sanctifica∣tion
to bee solemnized, as Psal. 92. by the just, for the godlynes of them and praise of his maker. For salvation is not by strength but by fayth, as appeereth in the Lordes battailes, by patience, the Armour of the saintes. Gods holy Oracle and mercy seat considereth all men. From hence was Moses admonished, Num. 7. by the brest plate of Iudgement, the ingraven form of Godhead and wisedom, Exod. 28.39. Construction. Lamed, leerning, shewing the instruction promissed, Ps. 32. The pre∣servation of the Saintes and beleevers. Levit. 8. shewing judgement, justice, mercey and truthe to be the definition of the word of God, Ioh. 1. Math. 23. that yee may know what it is, and this is a lerning. This Psalme belongeth to the former, by repeating the wordes therof, and the mystery, in the prospect of the Eternal, doubled for the preest, and deeps in treasures, and counsell, and cogitation, for the brest plate of judgement imbrodered. The Efficacy and power of the word of God, the eternity of the light, the advisement, & discretion therof, the brest plate, and the vanity of humane lerning. What reverence it asketh, what fear of offending, how precious the observing, and how painfull the of∣fending is. Fear yee the Eternall, &c. Ghimel, hee rewardeth according to all mens workes, how sure it cometh, how beneficiall to the elect, the providence to thē that fear God, for the best understanding. Ther is no safety by multitude fortitude, nor faculty, but all grace and pardon and forgivenes, help and protection, is by fayth and patience. The fear of God is the observing of the commandements, which is his word, and the makeing conscience of transgression therof: seeing all that is don is for fear or love, and this is fi∣nall and a principall lerning, as the End of the commandement is love, &c. 1. Tim. 1. The Scriptures are an Eternall Oracle of counsell and advise, they have both Vrim & Thummim, in them, light of knowledge, and perfection of life. The tree of know∣ledge and of cariage that is taught of God, Gen. 3. Io. 6. 1. Thess. 5. and this is that which the preest is to bear upon his hart, and to be indued with all: to shew that the king∣dom of God standeth in suffering, and not in pomp. Genesis. Metheg, a bridle, so is the word of God a rule to hold us in: and direct us, it is full of regularity, right and strait and true, as the world it self in his cours, the honour of upright mē. For Metheg Jasher or Munnah, Metheg turned to Munnah, to serve Zakeph caton, the grammaticall Acent. Metheg gaja, the accutest and loudest musick Accent. Other propertyes of the rule bee expressed by the words, counsel, Actions, by faith and patience, by the waiting and trustinge, by refreining & absteining from ill, & restraining the minde. And this is a moderation above all kingdom, or worldly dominion of hors, or man whatsoever, and governeth all things. PSALM. XXXIV. FOr Gods mercyes upon him & giving him that strength of beleeff, hee resolveth to praise him and bless him allwayes, and with all his might, and allureeth a whole congregation to the sanctifying of him, for the releeff of his distressed case, by his great goodnes and mercyes: in guarding him by the spirit of his word. Therfor hee will now let them know the use and benefit of Gods service, and fear: that is, that it will make men like giants, for countenance and continuāce, and state of Eternity, Psal. 112. And for stature like goodly Cedars: and as it is the way to long life, by de∣scription: so what this service and fear is, by definition, Psal. 92. and how it is accomplish∣ed: to speak plainly and truely, & without any hypocrisy or dissimulation, to doe good, and not evill, following the way of peace. And in this way the Lord will look upon them and hear them allwayes, and deliver them out of all evills. Bee the woes of the just never so many, yet hee will save him whole from falling into temptation, when the wic∣ked by som ill shall be utterly desolate wasted and slaine. And this is expressed farther by a mystery between P, and P, in the A, B, C, rew, shewing that the afflictions of the church, shall have joyes sevenfold after captivity, of 70. at 490 yeers end, as in two Reshes, and Tsade, in the Vers Resh, wher hee sheweth eternall comfort to the just by Gods favours, and the utter condemnation of the wicked by Gods angry lookes upon thē out of his word. And this behaviour, David accounteth to availe much to the streng∣thening
of his faith: to waite for all promiss of this life, and that to com. And thus much for the upright childe of the Church, begotten by much misery and affliction, and brought foorth by a painfull travaile, Ps. 102. as the childe of the holy Ghost and sonn of God by righteousnes. This summ of 490, is made up, by multiplying Zain by gnain, seventy by seven: the one beeing made principall, by exemption of Vau, and the other finall, by doubling of Pe, Ps. 25. in the first letters of the three first wordes in the vers Resh, is the whole 490. expressed also as before, and likewise you may see the same in the first letters of the two first words in the vers Zain, and thes both expounded in the vers Gnain, and Tsade. Construction. Lamed, lerning. The lerning is heer the fear of the Lord, defineed for a passing wisdom to resist the Divill, and escape temptation. It teacheth Redemption & deliverance & saveing of the just at last, & therfor the letter Vau, a hook or crook, is left out of the Abce for the wicked; which shall no longer continue or hold the just. And also conscience of sinne and bashfulnesse of evill, bridleth and with-holdeth the Iust. So this defection of Vau standeth vpon holding and loosing. The Lions shall bee de∣fectiue and faile for all their clawes, but they that seeke the Eternall shall not, &c. These kindes of hooks ther bee: seeking, clawing, visiting, calling, compassing, crying, relyeing. The wickeds terme Rashang shall be maimed, and his bones broken & bee all dismem∣bred, and be slaine by Ragnah, the terme evill, taken from it, the first and last letters of his name, his own property, which is dooing of ill, and thus hee commeth to desolation. Daleth a dore. Keep thy tong, &c. watch thy mouth, be porter at the doore of thy lips, as Ps. 141. Lamed and Daleth, maketh Ledh, which is to beget, as the childrē of God are they that feare him, serve him, seek him and rely on him. And to such is his lesson, & to such is life, and to such shall bee no desolatiō, and the matter is plain by itteration of the wordes. Genesis. The Genesis of this Psalme is much confirmed by the Title. Tagnam is taste or behaviour, and Tagnam is the Grammaticall Accent, the sense is the best taste of both, the changeing is the declineing of both. The Grammaticall Accent turned into Azla or Ge∣resh, & the Rhetoricall into Qadmah, & is signified by thes words Iegareshehow Vajelek, and so riseth the Regiment and variation of Accents, from Metheg. A life without godly∣nes is no life, no more is any speech sensible without Accents or Pointes. The fear of God is sweetnes of life, & the acutenes of understanding is a good distinction, against Davids conterfet distraction. See how hee thinketh of all the fiue Senses, and begin∣neth at the Vers He, for seeing and smelling, and in Zain, for hearing, and Hheth, for touching and in Tet, for tasting, with moste effectuall intimation. PSALM XXXV. BEcaus of the privy trap of fals and cruell witnesses to take away his life, and de∣ceitfull and Collusion talk, and derision of Saul his pursuer and mighty Enimy: and the greatnes, yea the kingdom of compassion in him, toward Saul and his followers; and their sport at his misery: and their underhand plotting for his life, and secret tearing and backbiteing of him; and their insulting for advantage over him, rewarding evill for good: as Ps. 109. He prayeth for their suddain and inevi∣table destruction, by the Iustice of the Caus. That the Eternall will stand before them, and stop them with his weapons, that they may bee all in darknes, and slippery pla∣cees, with a cruell winde behinde them, to make them fall and vanish, as Ps. 141. That is, that for a Iudgement, their own causles fury and malice, with their ignorance and unconstancey likewise, may Iustly, bring unawares their own destruction: that they may not laugh at him, nor haue their willes, but bee eternally ashameed. And that hee and all just ones may have caus to rejoyce; to tell and commend the Iustice of the Eternall for ever. That without ever a broken bone, hee may soundly confess the in∣finitnes of his salvation, by him, and rejoyce for euer in him; that hee may be delivered from all evill, which is from the will and desire of his Enimyes. And that God would bee awake at his judgement, and at his quarell, and shew him salvation out of his word: and assure him, that hee may proclaim it. That drowzines of minde, and lazynes and
care of the world, take not away his Zeal, and bereave him of understanding; and de∣stroy him. Construction. Lamed, for lerning or instruction. And heer upon hee groundeth a stratagem or doctrine of warr: by mention of the instruments, help and incourage∣ment, from God, as Ps. 18.144. in the beginning: and discouragement and shame to his Enimyes that bee wrongers of him. Their instruction is snares & intanglement, false witnesses, ill for good, rejoyceing at harme, detraction, mocking, grinning and skor∣ning, laughing and wincking, deceiveing, gaping and mowing with the mouth, to vex him out of his life. Hee maketh none like God for help: therfor he doubleth his first request, arise and awak to my judgement, &c. and also the wordes for his Enimyes confusion, as a consequence of their own lerning, for their not beeing right in Gods sight. He paragogique. They are gathered together. Heah, an Interjection of skor∣ning, doubled oft, and intimated in all the way of the wicked: also He, for seeing and beholding. How long wilt thou behold it? &c. wee haue seen it, thou seest, ô Eternall, &c. awake to my judgement, &c. Lah, Lamed, and He, from Lahah, utterly to fayle, as the mischevous and deceitfull, Gen. 47. Prov. 26. that make a sport of vexation. Genesis. The Gutturall letters, and Resh, are heer the devouring wicked ones, that seek, this way to swallow the just, by their irregularity and crooked wayes: and to dimm their glory. They bee for thes wordes: as for my freend, or for my brother, &c. again for thes wordes: ah sir, our ey hath seen it, or wee haue seen it, &c. in the interjec∣tion, and the two first letters of the next wordes following: and again, for thes wordes: ho, wee haue our desire, wee haue swallowed him, for the gutturalls only. PSALM. XXXVI. BEcaus of the ungodlynes which hee seeth in the wicked, that neither fear God, nor will walk in his way, setting light by it, as his dayly trespass sheweth, but is caryed away with pride, and led astray by a wicked hand, unto destruction, Prov. 16. considering the greatnes of the kindenes and faythfullness of the Eternall, the highth and depth of his justice and judgement, as Ps. 119. l, and the pretiousnes of his way, when it saveeth all men: his word beeing their protection and shadow called his wings, the fat and liquor of his hous, their refreshing, his light, their guide & instruction: as Psal. 29.110. hee prayeth that hee will bestow his kindenes and righteousnes upon them that know him, and men of upright mindes, that hee may not err, and fall after the same manner. And this from the Paradise and church of God, Gen. 2. for the ri∣vers of Doctrine, flowing hence. Ther is a well of life in the Law, and a great depth of judgement in the word of God, and the righteousnes therof, the light to walke by: the wicked are proud and skorn it, and are condemned for their extreame trespas against it. and therfore, hee prayeth for grace out of it, that pride of minde lead him not into temp∣tation, nor wicked counsell draw him to fall into the damnation of it, like them that never rise again, which is an utter defection, for want of grac & the fear of God, Ps. 34. Construction, Lamed, lerning. The doctrine heer, is grace, and reprobation: or ap∣probation and rejection, the one word answering to the other by the like repetition, ech thrise, to import it. Which are the contrary studyes of the Godly and the wicked. The one calleth for Gods favour, or his kindenes, which is life; & ther is a fountain of it, that will never be drawen dry, and an everlasting light, yf it shine upon us: the other studyeth nothing but greeff and molestation, so kindenes and greeff be the wordes repeated. And hee maketh nothing of sinn. The word Gnenau, his eyes, commeth twise, in a hard construction, to shew it. The letter Vau, for a hook or crook, is for the instrument of drawing of the same kindenes, by a metaphor, for lerning, which is a kinde of drawing, as wee draw knowledge out of the word. And this instrument Christ used, that the woman of Samaria perceived not. Likewise pride, and the powerfull hand of the wic∣ked draweth to damnation, as pride goeth before the fall, Prov. 16. the two letters to∣gether, Lo, doe signify property, or habit, to wit, his, or belonging to him. In the first wordes the wickeds habit is shewen, by which hee is condemned: in the next, Gods
property, by which all are saved that love it. And this for a standing or falling per∣petuall. Genesis. He beginneth with the wickeds trespass, and endeth with his utter fall and defection: which sheweth that of him and of his end, hee speaketh. The letters Aven, for the word greeff, bee defective letters, also Lamed, which is intended by a repetition & a construction, Chadal, to Leav off, and Maas, to refuse, betoken the defectives also, and utter falling. PSALM XXXVII. HEe exhorteth to that heavenly kingdom of Christ, that is, fayth & patience in all distress. For allurements therto, hee propoundeth to the just: prosperity, cleernes of judgement, everlasting success, & continuance upon earth, harts de∣sire, peace after affliction, satiety in time of dearth, certainty and blessing in proceeding, unguiltynes in judgement, and all help, salvation and deliverance, from the Eternall. And willeth them not bee troubled, at the wicked course and prosperity of naughtie men, as Psal. 79.73.86. seeing the end of them, & their posterity, is suddain; whē they once persecute the Iust: like growing grasse, that is in the flower, cut to wither, and not suffered to seed, Ps. 92.109. and like a brave Imp, that is soon broke-en off, or dyeth. So vanisheth, and consumeeth all their bravery, honour and advancement, like smoke in the ayer, that love not God. The note of the Iust man is compassion, boun∣tyfullnes, liberality, and consolation in the Eternall; wise comunication, and dayly me∣ditation on the Law of God, that hee fall not. The note of the wicked: hee ever work∣eth and deviseth, by all meanes against the just, hee hath not pitty, and will borrow & not pay again, hee will not bestow but rob. Now because in this Psalme, the just mans part is true meaning, waiting for the Eternall, trusting and delighting in him; that is the ob∣serving of his Law, shunning evill and dooing of good, the beginning of wisdom and un∣derstanding: the form of the Psalme, is an A, B, Cc like instruction, in the Hebrew. That ther bee no imprudencey left to God, & his spirit: heer is exposition of every letter in the Rew. Therfor mark the interruption, mark the Iteration, the acceptation and imbraceing of som, and reprobation and exprobation of other letters of the rew, and the generall allusion to the termes of them, as Nun yong, &c. that yf they would wait 430 yeers Quoqh, Shin, & Lamed, in Quoph; they should inherit the land Canaan, mark the letters Tsar, Tsade, & Resh for Tsadiq, and Rashang, the righteous and the wicked. Ther∣for mark the replenishing of the mouth and minde of the righteous in Tsade, and the Arring, and currishnes of the wicked, by this Iteration, of all these Arres and Gnains in his Raithi, or the letter Arr or Resh, Persius Sat: 1. wher is taught 400. also. And leaving out Gnain in the rew &c. to shew the cutting off of the wicked, beeing the last letter of the term Rashang, for his posterity: and the blessing of the righteous, with peace and prosperity, Ps. 128. and long life, Psal. 34. and posterity in Shalom, the holding out of the Iust, 930, the yeers of Adam, as Ps. 144. in Tsel, a shadow. Tom va jasher: in Shin, for the space from the promiss to the Temple of Salomon, & likewise the same number from the Temple to Christ, all perfection and uprightnes, even twise 930. as in Quoph also. And thus in the Chronicle from the promiss to Christ, the Prince of Peace: with many a gooly stage of salvation, & refreshing of fayth, Psal. 25. Out of his experience of the Law, & his fayth, hee prayeth the Church to be patient and wait a while, And they shall haue peace enough and the wicked shall be cutt off, and the inheritance shall be theirs: shewing that the birth of righteous men hath a painfull travaile, but a comfortable and a joyfull deliverance at last, as Ps. 34. Construction. Lamed, lerning. The doctrine heer is the way of God, Psal. 1. the truthe and life, Io. 14. the Law and Gospell of Christ, the end wherof is salvation, by righteousnes and judgement. The meanes is patience, and the Enimy, anger. For all helps are lost, by not indureing, and impatience, and headynes, and rashnes and hasty ma∣lice: which is the speedy cutting off of the wicked. For by this, their attempts turn all against themselves, but God helpes the Godly, because they beleeve & wait for his pro∣miss.
By their patience, they are made perfect, and by perfection are they prolonged to Eternity. For all his speech and thoughts are of the wisdom and judgement of the Law of God, and all his steps according to that brest plate, the power of God, and indue∣ment of his sainctes, that his carriage failes not. The letter Zain, for conception and apprehension is the same. The repetition of these wordes shall proov it. Way, Iudgement, help, salvation, wait and rely, rescue &c. right and perfection. Lamed and Zain, toge∣ther, is Laz, to decline from this true way, which is abomination to the Lord, and therfor are such justly and speedily cutt off. Vau, abounding in the last verse out of his place sheweth, that God, is saveing, redeeming, and rescueing and delivering, is a kinde of uncrooking and unheaching of the just out of the wickeds handes. Genesis. Hee worketh upon the Gutturall letters, and that you shall observe, when you com to every one of them in the Abce, for their irregularity in Grammer, touching Dagesh, and Sheva. In Aleph, hee adviseth against Anger, and Ielousy: which is a devouter and a consumeing fire in a man, Psal. 124. which hee remedieth with patience. In He, he adviseth the same, and hath all the Guttural letters and Resh, doubled in that verse, to shew the same. Presumption and wrong from the wicked and their success, doth eat the just, for the just be perfect and regular, and the wicked are irregular and outlawes. In Cheth, they shew their quarell: they will have Cateph Pathach, rapine, and destroy the right rule: and therfor they are rapt away and destroyed. In Gnain, is manifest defection, by the leaving of that letter quite out of the rew: as the rest are enimyes and defectives to the rule. In Resh, mark how Resh is sorted with all the gutturalls: and how often it is doubled with them, their great glory and suddain dificiencey. PSALM XXXVIII. BEeing once over-reached and tripped by Nathan the Prophet, concerning his sinn, that hee had not a word to say; hee was fain to be silent at all the railing, and subtile practises of Absolom his Enimy, and his complices, Shemei, Achitophel, and others, lest they should upbraid him and laugh at him: and his body beeing wholely distempered with the wrath of God for the same, and his greeff of minde ther∣for so great, beeing forsake-en of all; that by unexpressible sighes, hee is force-ed to si∣gnify, his requests and desire, to God that knoweth all, that hee would vouchsafe to ans∣wer and still them: yet because his cause is good against his Enimyes, bee they never so-many: hee prayeth, that hee will not correct him, nor be from him, but be his salvation, and make haste to help him. Hee sheweth his sore suffering for sinn, Psal. 134. through his faith and waiting for Gods salvation, praying that God will not consume him with correction, nor in his anger quite forsake him, but with all speed, help him and save him, and answer him, and releev him in his sorrow, for confessing his sinnes. Sorrow and affliction beget children unto God, and with much travail and long waiting and great correction are they born, and with much adoe are the righteous delivered from the body and death of Sinn, and folly and wrath of God, and corruption of the flesh and bondes and thralldom of Satan, and all adversity: to be brought to the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God, and to bee raised again in the Spirit, and to bee made alive again by righteousnes and forgivenes of Sinn. And this for the low estate of suffering, the very death and passion of a just man. Like that of Iob and Ierimiah, that thought no sicknes so sore as theirs. So hee hath no soundnes left in all his body, that hath lost a bone, and is halting, and alone, and in need of help, as Adam, Gen. 2. Construction. Lamed, doctrine. His declination by sinn, his hard discipline. Hee ma∣keth himself a scholer under the rod, & is sorely corrected for missing his rules, the Law of God, that it sticketh both on his stomack & on his back: hoe is bowed, weake & bruse∣ed, hee is sad, hee is sore, hee is greeved, his hart cryes and is removed, and hee is sensles with sorrow, as yf hee were aware of nothing: for all parts pay for it, the rage of error is such. And heer hee thinketh upon Adam, that ther was no help left meet for man, Gen. 2. among men: for freends help not, but are corrupt and decitfull to intangle, and Enimyes hurt, and are against him. So hee maketh God his maister and his helper, and
recoverer & waiting, Ps. 94. for that the offence is only against him, and hee only is sen∣sible of his sorrow & of his desire. Thusmuch you shall perceiue by mention of all the wordes in that text of Adams wound, and curious repetition of them. For the Law woundes all men. Gen. 2. Cheth, the broken and destroyed state of sinfull man. The two letters, together, make Lach, green, and fresh, and lively: his estate is all contrary, and therfor, so hee argueth upon the contrary. Genesis. The Gammaticall part is deficiencey. When hee seeth how imperfet a scholer in the Law, hee is, discernes how foolish and pervers his wayes are: hee cal∣leth himself such and Heteroclite as this, for all kinde of defectivenes. Ther is no whole thing or health &c. Ther is no ease or peace or perfection &c. And this of Verbs Perfet and Imperfet, the Imperfet are quiescents or defectives: the one, is of let∣ters present and silent, which neither heare nor speake: the other, of letters abolished for ill neighbourhood. As freendes are not to be ued or trusted to: so Enimyes are not to bee conferred with. Nun, is diversly defective in the Psalme, and for that, the num∣ber of verses agreeth with the Abce number of letters, and is likewise consonant to Adams defect, by his stroke with that sinfull sleep, Gen. 2. This is Nah, nireeh, by the words: in the beginning, his arrows light, and his hand lyeth, &c. All his desire and his groning. &c. PSALM. XXXIX. BY silence in the last Psalme, some good things beeing forborn becaus of the wicked: which now occasioneth Ieduthun as followeth; to inquire how long hee can indure alive, considering his correction, frailty, vanity and shortnes of the age of man, of no abideing, as Psal. 119. g, k, and beeing, but as a strangeer or guest in the earth, because hee waiteth for the Lord, and is not troubled with worldly af∣faires: hee would bee delivered from his trespasses, and temptation of Gods hand, and haue his correction somwhat abated before hee dyeth. That hee be not a reproch to the vile and foolish, seeing that correction for iniquity, freats and consumeth like a moth. Which as hee seeth, will otherwise shorten the shortnes of his time: and this with pitty∣full cry and request unto the Eternall. Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and his dayes are full of sorrow. In the former Psalme ther is great wai∣ting of David, for the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God, out of the bondage of cor∣ruption, by indureing so great adversity for a godly life: Heer hee considereth the vani∣ty of the creature, and the small moment of the life of man, and the great and vain stirr that man makeeth in the world, that hee can not be silent at. But that his waiting is for nothing, but for forgivenes of his trespasses, and the abatement of his troubles, and some refreshing ere hee dyeth. And this is all his waiting & covet & desire, that hee suffer not reproch by the vile & wicked people of the world, or be ashamed for the hope that hee is subject to. And this for an other article of his fayth which hee hath gotten by the Law. Vpon the story of Cain and Abel, Gen. 4. two bretheren, vanity and vexation Ecclesiastes. One slayeth the other, as worldly sorrow causeth death. Construction. Lamed, doctrine, or Limmed, to teach. The doctrine beginneth, wher the first word, I sayd, or I thought, is used, in the last Psalme, and that concerning his halting and imperfection, and that in speech. Hee would faine preach, it seemes, but then woe be to him, for the cavilling of the wicked. yet preach hee will, it seemes, for his conscience can not hold to be silent, hee will keep his wayes, and keep his mouth, and rule his tongue. This is lerning and an observation. God sets the wicked upon him, and this is a sharp rod of correction: hee desireth his end, or ease and forgivenes; that hee be not made a fool for his waiting, which is only on God. Spare him, take off the rod, and his sore hand upon him, and hearken to his begging and heare his crying: and this according to the case of a scholer. And therfor is Adonah, so especial-ly and so often used, in this Psalme and the other, for Lord or Maister: Teth, for the extending of Gods hand upon him, and so much provoking him. Both the letters together make Lat, to ly hid, or to hide. Against this, hee prayeth to be shewed the hidden knowledge of his end.
Genesis. The grammaticall instruction or creation is Nah nistar, the hiddē quiescent & that is seen by the doubling of that form, in Edhegnah, & Jedang; & Elek, &c. One quie∣scencey is silence, an other, death, and the end of his dayes: another, vanity, & vanishing, when all is don, and at an end: and another, the end of his punishement. With double mention of Ish, also, Man, wounded and cureed, Gen. 4. PSALM XL. AFter long study in the Law of God, called the waiting on the Eternall, Ps. 130. beeing satisfyed and delivered from ignorance, & doubtfull hesitation, called a mirey dungeon: and haveing obteyned a sound beleeff, called sure footing upon a Rock, that made him change his note by a praise to God; that brought many to the like confidence in the Eternall, that saw it: now shewing the infinit miracles that God hath don for the Church, and their happines for trusting in him: and seeing that no sacrifice nor offering can gratify, content or satisfy for the same, as Ps. 50. but hearing and obeying the word: and findeing his own aptnes, promptnes and inclination that way: hee starteth up, & uttereth his profession and fayth (the preaching of the same) which be∣cause it is the whole will of God, Ps. 1.137. & hee hath pleasure in it, and for mercy be∣stowed upon othersheerin: hee prayeth for mercy, as Ps. 119. L. And speedy deliverance, from the Eternall, Psal. 61. out of his innumerable and pittifull evills for iniquity, by his Enimyes that seek his life. That they may bee stund with their shame for ther mock∣ing; and they that seek the Eternall and love his salvation, may rejoyce in him and magnify him for ever. Construction. Mem, signifieth waters, of which hee maketh divers kindes, accor∣ding to the propertyes therof, as hee beginneth in the first word doubled, Qavah, to wait or hope, from the nature of a standing pool, called from thence Miqve, and so for, the sea Gen. 1. continual-ly waiting for resort. So is Tiqveh, hope also, and for the con∣tinuall frequenting of the Scriptures and word of God, from Quavithi, in the other Psalme. The Scriptures are called waters: in my belly is the Law for the vessel &c. The great congregation twise uttered, for the Church and assembly. I preach &c. for I sprinkle, the partes and propertyes of the Law and of the will of God. And of these waters; the waightyest things, are Iustice and fidelity, truth and mercy, and the great and wonderfull works of God, which hee declareth Actor. 2. Another kinde of waters are woes, and crosses and iniquityes in the world, that overcom the harts of men, and take away their sight, when they abound, Ps. 32. like a swefen or soumn. An other kinde of waters are Enemyes, as Ps. 18. & 70.32. Ierm. 49. That study to make an end of him and to hurt him, and flout him. These waters hee would have astonished, and run back for shame and their current stopped: that the right students my rejoyce for delive∣rance. All which is notable by itteration. Genesis. A kinde of quiescencey is heer in his hope, his fayth, his rock, the Eternall, for constancey: as a sound ground-work of preaching. His ripenes in the Scriptures and perfect knowledge and understanding of them, Ps. 73. This is his rest that shall comfort, like Noah &c. Gen. 7.2. Pet. 2. hee is pleased also in edification and reparation. to tell Gods miracles and his mercyes. The will of God is his delight. This is his rest and rely in all troubles, adversityes, afflictions and reproch concerning all his works and sorrow of hands, to comfort him, Gen. 7. that God may be pleased in him, Math. 3. And thus by the revolution of the words of the text. PSALM XLI. COnsidering the goodnes of the Eternal to them that bee good to the poor, and their happines that bee releevers and instructers of them, as Psal. 112. and the hardnes, ill will, and mercylessnes of his Enimyes, and confederat freendes to∣wards him, when hee was ill and in misery: hee prayeth the Eternall himself, to ake pitty upon his sinfull soul and heal it, which had sinned against him; and to raise him
again, that hee may also recompense them. Knowing heerby the love of God towards him, when his Enimyes have not their wilis against him; but hee keeps his integrity and the presence of the Eternall, to wit, his divine meditation (thanked be God) for ever. The teaching of the poor the Law, is the saveing from sinn, and David beeing sick with sinn; now for his doctrine out of the Law, payeth for forgivenes and remission of his sinnes, and to bee healed and to bee revive-ed from sorrow, and raised out of troubles. His Enimyes beeing against his resurrection, pray that still som divillish distress may keep him down and torment him, that hee never rise again, and never bee cheered more. But because nothing can quell his Enimyes more, then Gods favour in mainteyning his integrity out of the Law, and keeping him still in the study therof: and nothing cheere him so much, as a sound beleef out of the word: Ps. 21. and nothing pay his Enimyes so sore, as his recovery: and that ther is no way to requite or quite them but fayth, wher∣with the wicked are not indueed nor haue any weapon so durable: they are so throughly payed for iniquity by his foundnes. And this is the way hee desireeth to pay them, Ps. 91.6. and this for his everlasting life, his resurrection of his body and forgive∣nes of his sinnes. And this is the faith that delivereth from Satan, and all divillish, fals and conterfet visitation, both of foes and freendes, as in Iob. Which is most inci∣dent to Godly men, because they are a vexation to the wicked; that when hee seeth no way to still them: yet hee is sure that his prosperity and redemption from misery must needs pacify them, and make them have not a word to say. Which Psalme is an abridge∣ment of the whole book of Iob: for an absolution for sin, after confession and repent∣ance: hee beeing well resolved of the favour & love of God in accepting of him, & that hee hath pleased him, because of his Advancement. Construction. Mem, is waters, and Aleph, to teach. The waters of doctrin are a great blessing, and hee is moste blessed that bestoweth it. The waters of doctrine are taken for physique, and for medicine, from the freshnes of their nature, and their fluentnes: for Enimyes of divers sortes, and for misery, for overflowing, as Is. 7. By the one kinde, hee prayeth to be saved from the other. That hee swim upon them and not be sunk by them: as the waters of Noah, for comfort, and destruction, mark the repetition. Genesis. The quiescenceys are divers. Doctrine healeth the sick. They haue eas in their sicknes, and rest on their bed, & are well supported, they have rest for their soules, and forgivenes of sinn, & it easeth the minde. The contrary, is molestation & vexation, of Enimyes and the world, that would have him dead, and out of minde, for a rest when he had no rest, and never no eas while hee liveth. His professed freendes are not peace∣able to him. These waters, hee wishes for lerning enough to asswage and quiet. Hee marketh Gods plesure and quiescency in him, in brooking of his integrity and takeing him to his presence, and useing him, and in prevailing over them. For a certain token of forgivenes.
THE SECOND BOOK. PSALM. XLII. HIs sonn Absolom having drivē him out of Ierusalem from the presence & ser∣vice of God, called his face, and haveing him in chase and hot pursuit, and skorning him, his God and his salvation: saying, wher is thy God, and wher is thy salvation: as in Ps. 3. that hee was now in a new misery after that of Saul, like one deep calling another, or many chanels makeing a pool of affliction, with greeff upon greeff even to slaugther, Psal. 115. so that with extremity of teares and sighes and greeff, even in his very bones, at the railing and revileing, and hard oppression of the Eni∣my; and doubting of his God that hee so solemnly protested before them: David be∣waileth his Exile, and with great affectation of Gods presence again, prayeth for his loveing kindenes for it, that hee may have a song to sing for the same, Ps. 30. a prayer to the preserver of his life. With a good-cheer, still urgeing his undaunted confidence in the Eternall, confesseth him his present Salvation. But keeping alive the matter of the last book, which begann with Iehovah the Eternall, & his righteousnes, and ended, with the rock wherupon his foot standeth, the fayth and confidence that hee obteined by his way: hee proceedeth now by the Name of Elohim, judgement, and Kingdom of God, his Rock, useinge no other name in this Psalme but once Iehovah for mercy, & repeating that so often, and as ernestly as thirstynes requireeth drink. In whom hee is, and will bee ever comforted, and have his full trust and affiance, and for ever confess him, and waite for his salvation: and will indure, though it be never so long, in hope to come to Beth-el, Luz, and Iebuz, and Ierusalem, the hous of God, and his holly Hill and Taber∣nacle and Altar, and to the true service of God. And this from Exodus, for loveing kindenes and zeal, the fire and cloud: part of the Law. Construction. Mem, for waters. The Beast hath but one kinde, to quench his thirst: therfor his soul is unworthy to be expressed. But the soul of man hath divers, by reason of his divinity. The presence of God is the Scriptures: the waters of life, and salvation, and his God, and his Rock: cares, deeps, spoutes, breaches, waves, for afflic∣tion. Beth a hous: in tabernacles and the hous of God, hee honored the Scriptures, before them all, in Passover: this hee hath to prove Gods presence and salvation which hee will ever wait for without dismay, in all calamity. Attributes of water are also these: thirst, powring out, passing over, troubling, confess, make to flow or publish &c. As you shall finde plain by the allusion and affectation of wordes. Exodus. The first Petaroth, and chapter, beginneth with these wordes. These are the Names &c. The moste memorable, and the best names under heaven, and the only ones for salvation and invocation are the Names of God, which heer, hee never giveth over repeating. From hence the commission of Moses and of the Prophets; Christ & his Apostles, Exod. 3. what God? The God of his life, of salvation, his rock, the Eternall that shall com &c. PSALME XLIII. BY this prayer, hee claimeth his defense from God, becaus his Enimyes are ungod∣ly, unjust and deceiptful men; and so maketh the quarell his, wondring that hee should be thus rejected, and haue such cause of sadnes by oppression. And prayeing for a perfect understanding of the word, and his truthe called his light, that may lead him, and bring him again, to his hill, and to the Altar of God, his onely joy
and delight, to thank him: hee cheers up himself with this, that hee yet still waiteth on God and confesseth him his present salvation without despaire. After the cloud and fire, Exod. 13. To make this book suitable to the book of Exodus or comming out of Aegypt: you shall mark how hee dealeth. First, hee treateth of the person that brought them out: his only God, and trust, and relye, and present salvation, as in the last Psal. 42. wher hee medleth with nothing but his Name, & his confidence in his word, his thirst after it, his comfort by it, and attendance to it. So that hee will haue no other Godes but him, according to the first commandement. And because his deliverance must be by prayer: in this Psalme, hee frame-th his request from the Promiss, Gen. 15. That du∣reing this time of bondage of 400 yeers, wherein they were to be so ill intreated, by a wrongfull & a subtile nation: that God now would judge him, and fight his qua∣rell and deliver him, as Ps. 119. L. from such unkinde, untractable, subdole and unjust men, and by the light of his truthe, bring him to the right service of him. For his place, his dwellings, his Altar and his Person: that hee may com hard unto him, the God of all his joy, and delight, and that hee hath no other to bee mery with but him: and hee shall bee his onely and very God, and no other. And therfor hee willeth his minde not to be troubled and greeved, abased and dejected at this burden of sorrow for himself: but to trust still and to wait strongly upon this God, whom hee will worship, beeing sure, that hee will with all speed deliver him, & presently save him. The mistery of this Psalme is easily gathered from the first wordes, which are plain from the promiss: as for the 400. yeers in Ribhah Ribhi, wher the two Arrs make the 400 of affliction, by their tra∣vail and servitude, and unhumane usage whom God will judge. The same wordes com again to the same purpose in Psalme, 119. R. 74. And thus hee intendeth to tune his harp, in this book, wholely to the first commandemēt, & play upon the promiss. Gen. 15. for the strength of beleeff: that hee would never give over his confidence for any afflic∣tion: bee it never so long or so sore. For Truthe, the other part of the way of God. Construction. Mem, waters. For nations: and deceitfullnes and failing also: Iob 6. light and truth for the waters of the Law. Other kindes and propertyes in the last Psalme: oppression, Enimy, trouble, confess, which is to make to flow abrode &c. Ghimel, for reward, is heer answered by judgeing and revengeing Gen. 15. for the equity and justice in the office of a judge. 1. Sam. 24. And by his solemne celebration as a sacrifice. Ghimel, for waining also, as by his waiting, Ps. 131. Mog, both the letters, are to melt: as when the soul is troubled and the hart fainteth. Exodus. Gods name: his strength & confidence, and his Mirth, and his celebration, as Ps. 28. For his salvation: his mirth depends upon his salvation, and his salvation upon his presence, and that, upon his fayth. And these are, Termes, and definitions of God-head, as Names of God. PSALM XLIIII. AS the people of God, in old time, prospered not by the strength of their own armes (as appeered still by the ods against them) but by their wise direction, Ministry and discipline called the right hand and arme of God: and the knowledge of the Law, called the light of his countenance: and his favour, be∣cause their Religion pleased him: God himself beeing leader of their armyes, as a sheep∣heard leadeth his sheep: and seeing God hathe now failed to goe with his people (erring in their understanding) and made no reckoning of them; but hath given them, and sold them for nothing, to their Enimyes, & obscured them among the Dragons, the Hethen, to shame them: that they suffer all manner of reproche, of all about them; that Iacob is ashamed of his commande: now because hee himself trusted not in his own strength for salvation, but hee and they all of the same faith, and the same Religion, and that they never failed a Iot of the covenant between God and them (notwithstanding their mise∣ry) but held themselves from all forain worship: and for that all their punishment was for him, that is, for their Religions sake: The church, as Ps. 134. prayeth for his loveing kindenes likewise, that hee would consider their oppression & not to sleep, as Ps. 121.
but redeem and help them, and by his Name deliver them. That they might have a victorious Issue over their Enimyes, with shame to them, and prais to his Name for ever. In the first part of this Psalme, is the manifest majesty, & souveraignty, & worship of God in his workes of old, as Ps. 111. & hee makeeth him a king for the bringing of the childrē of Israel out of Aegypt, by his judgemēt in his Law, & placeing thē in the lād of promiss, pittying their case & favouring thē. Makeing Iacob a cunning wrestler, & to trise up the heeles of the hethē, & supplant thē. So now as the church hath need, hee prayeth God to help Iacob & the Church against their Enimyes, because their trust is onely in him, & not in weapons, & the strength of man. In the second part: hee sheweth that the Church is in wors case them that in Aegypt, and their suffering, slavery, subjection and servitude far greater: in somuch, as hee sheweth heerin, true sacrifice for the love of God. Affliction standeth for Sacrifice, as sacrifice is a Type of affliction in the Law; which beeing indure∣ed for the love of God and his Law, and covenant: doth chalenge favour from God, & reconcilement to him. Now the Church offereth to bee tryed by God, to whom no se∣crets of the hart are hid: that dureing all this heavy burden of oppression, they haue never forgotten, nor been fals in his covenant: neither in thought nor deed have once fallen back, or turned their steps aside out of his way: or have been out of minde of him, or haue once held up their handes or besought any other God. And for this great love, they beeing thus dayly slain: according to the second commandement (as it belon∣geth to the first) hee prayeth for Gods favour and redemption, out of their low estate by affliction and oppression; with a sound hope and confidence of salvation, as they have offered their syncere and clean harts, and upright and pure mindes, the sacrifice of righ∣teousnes and innocencey before him, as Psal. 4. from Abrahams offering of his sonn, Gen. 22. Construction. Mem, waters. As the Hethen, Nations and peoples, Enimy, af∣flictors, misery and oppression, place of Dragons, great rivers or sea of Aegypt. Daleth, a door: the door of hope, Hos. 2. Is. 65. from Ios. 7. door, for a vally. The Entrance of their plantation in Canaan. Which was in the vally of Akor wher they received discomfiture and fled, before Aie. The Allusion is plain, by repeating of the word Achor beeing of the same sound, Is. 45. Their turning back. Ther is a kinde of entrance by the sword which is called a door. Likewise the door of faith, Actor. 14. by the Mini∣stry called the right hand & Arme of God. And by the light of Gods presence, which is instruction. Wher by, Christ calleth himself a door, and a sheepheard, for goeing in and out by him, and his feeding of them, Ioh. 10. as of Cirus, Is. 45. Mad, to meat, for the division of the land by Iosua, Mad, a garment for both the letters. Exodus. His King and his Lord, the God of Isaack: that hee would not sleep when hee is called upon, and let his people be made a laughing stock to the world, but rise and help them. In Isaak was his covenant, & Iacob hitherto hath syncerely kept it: therfor they would not be made a scoff to the world, a reproche & shame to their neighbours, and all ignominy to suffer, as sacrifice, when they have Gods Name in such singular honour and reverence. From Isaaks Name and sacrifice, Gen. 17.22. which is heer meant by the vilenes of reputation, and sorenes of affliction, which they got by their de∣fect in warr, when Gods word and his presence shined not unto them. Remember the Echo: & like sheep for their meat, &c. like slain sheep &c. Again, thou puttest us a laugh∣ter, &c. thou puttest us a byword, &c. PSALM XLV. HE sheweth in this psalme, the Espousals of the Lamb and his wife: of Christ and the Church: the Kingdom and majesty of God Ps. 145. and the heavenly Ierusalem: the reconcilement between the word and the faythfull beleevers: for the mutuall love of wedlock, and chastity, and continencey in religion; by an Emblem of an eternall comfort, and a pleasant love song or Epithalamion, most sweetly. That as Mariage make-eth glad and mery hartes: that they bestow their hartes and delightes and whole love, one upon another: so that the Church should have
none other God but one. And to this purpose, hee handleth both partes of the Ephitha∣lamion, which sheweth to bee more glorious, and more virtuous then the earth can bear, yet occasioned by Salomons Match with Pharohs daughter. And beginning with the Groom: hee makeeth him the fayrest and best spokeen of all men, becaus by his gracious cariage, hee got worship and honour from all men, and is blessed of God for ever. And this is his Cincture, and strength, and virtue, Ps. 111.145. that ma∣keeth him like a Giant, or a worthy, Ps. 19.89. Hee makeeth him also a Knight, that is mounted upon victorious Truthe, and caried with meek Iustice, with true humility, to ride prosperously. That insisting and insideing heerupon, his Ministry and right hand may teach him terrible things: and from hence to steek his Enimyes to the hart. And with sharp and keen words, subdue the people under him. Lastly, hee makeeth him a King, that hath none but God for his Throne, and rest and confidence: for soundnes of Iudgement, and defense of religion. as Psalm 89. And his Rod of Iustice gets him a crown of rejoyceing, and anoyntment above his fellowes: from his very God that hee serveth. The pretious matter hee had to write of. His clothes are all perfumed with lovely cariage, and sweet behaviour, to make him delectable and amiable, before the Queen and her women, all in Gold and perles, the lovelynes of the church, for pu∣reity of religion and cleernes of doctrine, to delight him. And now, haveing runn through all the kindes of fansyes, and bravery of the word of God, of Christ, the Law and the Bridegroom, that can move love or affection, to allure the Church to his society and familiarity, and to woo them: hee passeth to the other part of the Epithala∣mion, of the Bride, the Church: how shee might possible, stirr the love of Christ unto her: And this is all, by her inward service of him, her allegiance and obedience to him, to forsake father and mother and all the world for him, to subject herself only unto him. And bow unto him and follow him, whither-so-ever hee goeth. And this is the bewty of the Bride that winneth her Husband, and this is the cariage that shall get her honour, and presents, and exaltation from the richest even her Humility. Besides, the Bride hath no outward glory, nor pompe, neither is the churches bravery in visibility, or worldly Eminencey: but is both secret and sacred, and moste spirituall and inward, to make it the more worthy, the more pretious, the more optative, ex∣petible and desireable: so that as, shee is inwardly moste glorious and rich: so the bra∣very of the Church, and riches of religion, is only in the depth of the spirit and divine wisdom, and secrecy of understanding, moste maydenly chaste and holy. Which be∣ing of a pure conversation, shall bee reveled and brought unto Christ, with a train, of pure virgines and undefiled Saintes, the Catholick Church: which is holy by the my∣steryes of godlynes. And the better to affect him: they shall com flowing to his court, with all alacrity and cheerfulnes, to pleas him. The end of all is, that in steed of Abraham, Isaak, and Iacob, his fathers, the principall men of religion: by this affini∣ty and union: ther may bee propagated, a stemm of princes out of their children, (they beeing becom one flesh) to rule all nations, to make his Name a famous memoriall in every generation, for the people to worship for ever. For his defense and deliverance. And this is a great secret, concerning Christ and the Church, for the convoy of the Church to the service of God, shewing their God and King and Defendour and Conductor. As the Poet hath Hector and Andromache for the Generall and his host. Construction. Mem waters, peoples and Nations and kingdoms &c. Throne for kingdom, Name for kingdom as in the Lords prayer. By the repeating of the eternity of both. This Throne is for ever &c. And thy Name and fame I will make remembred, by the people for ever and ever. &c. as Ps. 145.

PSALM XLVI. WHer God is present and people well advised, ther wanteth no redy help in distress: so the Church of God haveing allwayes the Ark and the doctrine therof, called the river-chanels of the citty, by them to instruct them: fear nothing. Though the rageing Hethen, called the roreing sea, set upon them: and though the Kingdomes called the mountains, shake with their proud invasion, and many Kingdomes overthrowen by it, and great alteration be in the world: yet they assure themselves, Ierusalem cannot be stirred, becaus God, their Ark and confidence is in it, and will help them early, before the Enimy be up; beeing sure by the word, the God of warr is with them, and will releeve them. That useth to make strange work in the word: as Ps. 76. to cease warrs, and make them hold their handes, that hee himself onely may bee exalted. A virgin shall conceive and bear a sonn, and thou shalt call his Name Immanuel. All the Churches conception is peace, and the childe that is born, is wonderfull for counsel, and the prince of peace, and hath all the government to himself, as a God of valour and father of eternity. And this is the God of Iacob that is all their Munition, the God of hostes that is allwayes with them, by their confidence in the wisdom and righteousnes of the Law. And in all their distresses they call upon him, as Immanuel, and in all commo∣tions, for the God of Iacob, the God of war and prince of peace, their safegard and whole relye. Beeing perswaded of present help from him, becaus they see, by the Scriptures: what wonderfull debate hee hath quieted, and the strife and contention hee hath ceassed, and the peace that hee hath made in despight of all preparation, that hee onely may bee conqueror, and stand the last man upon the earth, as Redeemer, and bee exalted for ever. For his dwelling allwayes among them, and his watchfullnes over them, and his early riseing to defend them, by the power of his word. And for this cause they will haue no other Gods but him, the God of hostes, the God of Iacob, the right God of their Salvation: upon whom they still presume, and are stout and undaunted for ever. Construction. Mem, waters: swelling, and roreing, and troubled waters: for Seas: the rageing of the Nations and Kingdomes: and for Warr: any distres and desolations by warr, as Da: 9. secondly, the quiet waters of life, in the temple, and doctrine of the word to save, which they call, the God of warr, for martiall discipline that is still on their side, and redy to help them: and voweth to prevaile over all the other kindes of waters.

THe Eternall being soveraigne King and Defender of all the earth, having con∣quered diverse Nations, giues Iacob the best inheritance, because he loved him; and sitting in his holy Throne (the Scriptures) of all people in the world hee
preferreth the Iewes, the people of Abrahams God: that is, them of the faith and righteousnesse of Abraham, and that of the law. Therefore, the Corites invent for the church, to sing a plaudite and triumph to their king, with all shrilnes & alacrity, for that their God raigneth and that for their Iustification. The second Psalme giveth war∣ning to all the world, to subiect themselues to the Promiss, and content themselues with obedience therunto, and reverently and willingly abide it: and not to resist the hope of the faithfull, for feare of destruction. Neither was the law of Moses made to resist the faith of Abraham, or against the promiss: but to describe the righteousnesse of Abraham, and set out the tree of a godly life, whose leaues never fall to the ground, as Psalme 1; but all his words are with judgement as Psal. 112. And so is the law the way to grace, and hindereth not the promiss: and Moses and the Prophets, to Abra∣hams bosom. Now the Sun-beames of the promiss psal. 2. in this Psalme, shine vpon the walles of Sion, both in the same words and matter. For God haueing subdued the Nations, and giuen Iacob a proud Inheritance: that hee hath prevailed with great shou∣ting, both high, and terrible: and is inthronized in his law, as a mightie King and defen∣dour of all the earth: for this great defence of the Church, and their deliverance, and their setting of them now at their rest: They will all Nations to triumph, and sing to their God, and extoll their King, and praise his wisedome, and to haue no other God, because this their God, the God of Abrahams people, haue been best defended of all the people of the world, and hee hath heere performed his promiss Gen. 15. And thus the childe of righteousnesse receaueth his blessing, psal. 2. and anoyntment aboue his fel∣lowes, as psal. 45. Now the reason of inverting the words, Abraham, Isack and Iacob, in the three last Psalmes: is, that hee may with Abraham conclude the promisse, and fall againe to the storie. And this also is holy and most mysticall, but vsuall: As Thummim before Vrim, Ps. 26.27. Sarah before Abraham psal. 111.112. and the diverse transposi∣tions and interruptions, altering and maiming of the order of the A B C Psalmes for godly mysteryes. Construction. Mem, waters, people and Nations, Inheritance, the pride of Iacob &c. Gods holy throne is the Sciptures, which is also waters. yf all the Nations in the world were gathered together, like the water Gen. 1. yet becaus hee reigneth over all in the scriptures, his people are cheeff for the preeminence of discipline, as the waters aboue the firmament, have domination over the waters beneath. So hee sitteth upon the water and ruleth he waters: Ps. 29. by subdueing all and takeing his choise. For this, upon the letter Zain, to hear: the loudest and moste triumphing noise and voices for the hearing, and sweetest chaunting and psalming is comanded, for the excellencey of his Majesty, by the way of waters also. Psalm. 93, 96. by a like metaphore of clapping &c, Exodus. The God of Abraham, one other of the Names of Moses authority and commission, is described, Exo. 3. From Gen. 14. by the terme, Eljon, High &c. Maggen Defens: words from that text. Ther is no higher thing then raigning and power and Dominion. And this for beeing above all, and excelling all: hee is to be honoured above all, and solemnized, as by the doubled wordes and phrases: Sing psalmes &c. so is hee over all, and passeth all, and his kingdom is for a kinde of passover, and promotion. PSALM. XLVIII. FOr the greatnes of the majesty of God, and the glory of Sion, the wonder of the world: the Enimyes that combineed against Ierusalem, were astonyed, and trembled for fear. This was Edom; Moab and Amon, against Iehoshaphat King of Iudah. Now becaus they know, that their Gods Righteousnes; Iudge∣ment and dayly kindenes for their service of him, dwelling in their towers and Temple, is their Defens; whose Name and Prais is over all the world: the Chorites sing in Pro∣cession his Iudgements, Ps. 97. goeing round about the citty, to consider her strength nd glory, to record it, and tell it to their children, that they may keep it in minde for
ever, in memory of their deliverance and serve him. As all bodyes live by the hart: so the Law, and body of Moses, is not without affection and devotion, and a liueing and a gratious soul within it, for salvation and recovery of Mankinde after sinn, and redemption after his fall. And this is by a righteous government called the Kingdom of God, which was still their conductor and defendour, and the cloud over the mercy seat, that was the priests warrant for sacrifice and atonement: so highly commended in the last Psalme. For the wonderfull grace and blessing of inheritance, bestowed upon them in the promiss: which was covered with a vail, as the vaile lay over their hartes and understanding, when they read it. For as the Law of Moses is to trick out and ex∣press the righteousnes of Abraham: it must not forget his faith, nor his love, nor his bountifullnes and giftes of the minde that last for ever: Iudgement, fidelity and mercy, the weighty matters, as Psal. 112. but in one Ceremony or other precept or complement, the whole man must be thought upon, as well for grace and adoption as for judgement and condemnation, as Ps. 101. seeing life is promissed to the observers. And this part of the Law, is that which Christ in the new Testament so much preferreth; as uprightnes and cleernes of the inner man, which is the absolute holynes and perfec∣tion of godlynes, the way to grace which hee requireth. Wherby a man seemeth to bee di∣vided against himself: the flesh against the spirit, & grace becommeth opposit to workes, as the Apostle sheweth by division of the Law. And this is Christes fullfilling of the Law, and baptisme of the holy Ghost, that angered the Iewes, and sett all the world on fire, beeing beyond the comun understanding. In this Psalme hee cometh to the kingdom and citty of their great king, and defendour, their God of righteousnes, in the last Psalme, & this is Ierusalem; their university, mount Sion, his holy hill, the school of all godlynes and virtue, and of the Law of God. The Law shall com forth of Sion, and the word of God out of Ierusalem &c. Now as all types of holynes were to bee moste glorious for worship and majesty: as Psal. 45.145.111. So the Iewes (for fame, of their religion) would have the place (like the tabernacle) to excell. So that all the world might take delight in the structure and order of the temple, and Synagogue of Ierusalem, this theatre and oracle of the Law, and stage wher the word is acted: more then the Queen of the South, took, in the sitting of Salomons servantes. Wher two or three are gathered toge∣ter in my name, ther am I in the midst of them, & so experience hath taught them and assureth the Church, that Gods love is allwayes in his Temple where his service is, and never away from them that fear him. And shewing first the greatnes of God in this place, for his dayly worship and his fame, his name & calling upon him, their munition, his presence and releeff upon their Batlementes, Psal. 56. by confounding their enimyes: his kindenes in his temple, which is better then life, as Ps. 63. his fame & praise over all the world: and because hee doth nothing but Iustice, with his right hand, and scepter of his lerned ministry; that breaketh all the heathen in peeces, as Ps. 2. that Sion and all Iu∣dah may be glad of his judgements: they would not have this place ever forgotten. For that this is the very God, their only God that hath saved them from death. And therfor likewise, they will haue no other God but him for ever. As in the former Psalmes, & ac∣cording to the Tabernacle, Exod. 36. wherin, the love of God was dayly resident. Construction.

return to, and to make mery at, and the Name of the Citty is, Ther is the Eternall, Ezech. 48. as the Name Iehovah the Eternall, is Righteousnes. PSALM XLIX. THe wisdom and understanding of this Prable, which hee would have all the world to know, is this. The vanity of riches to be trusted in, and of the Owners; their foolish wayes that glory in them, and their disappointments that keep not their honour, but dye like beastes, and consume in the pit, like rotten sheep, and their wealth commeth they know not to whom, to make mery withall, while death and the grave get dominion over them. And the comfort of the Poore in a hard time, in famine or other adversity, or perplexity, the crossnes of his life, called the iniquity of his heeles. That when as the Richeman that likeed this life, and the worship belonging to it, shall dye without riches or glory, to descend with him: the Poor-man shall bee, redeemed from his misery, and bee accepted and live, to bee heire to his fathers that are deceasseed, and injoy his substance, the word of God. Thus is the Poor man for his patience, exalt∣ed up to heaven, and the Richman condemned to hell, for want of understanding: the one beeing alive and happy, and the other dead and in hell for sorrow. They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear them. &c. Yf Moses and the Prophets can quench the wrath of God, and extinguish the flames of Hell, & quiet a tormented conscience; then surely, Moses and the Prophets are the true and living way to grace and to Christ: as Christe is the way to the father, and the understanding of Moses and the Scriptures. Abrahams bosom. And fom hence is that parable, luke 16. which is heer proclaimed to Riche-men, and Men in adversity. Which doctrine, as it is called a parable in the greek, and a comparison in the hebrew: so in latine, it is moste properly to bee termed a con∣jecture, which is a doctrine much used of the Iewes, called Signes, and is moste frequent in the Psalmes: parables beeing a good demonstration, & a principall evidence of truthe. As tokens shew freendes: so signes are a peece of knowledge, wherby wee are brought to beleeff: and as wee know in part by them: So is it a step of faith. And by this obser∣vation, David is mightily confirmed, & highly honoureth the doctrine through-out the Psalmes, and greatly complaineth, that Ierusalem wanted lerned men, therin, as Ps. 74. Therfor hee first propoundeth the Riche-mans travaile concerning the world: count∣ing it a hard thing for him to enter into the kingdom of heaven. And makeing all his habilements & facultyes of riches, nothing worth, and all his pleasure to bee but the flat∣tery of the world, and but for a short season: because the Rich hath many freendes, as Sa∣lomon sayeth, and good likeing, is highly commended of the world, that taketh him clean away and deludeeth him, and bewitcheth & astonyeth his understanding; that hee is no more capable then a beast Dan. 4. of the golden rules of righteousnes, by law or by faith, as a scholer of Ierusalem. So dyeth hee and goeth into oblivion, and descendeth into utter darknes, and corruption, like a dumb beast never to be mentioned more: which for want of fayth or virtue to succed him, or good education to out live or survive him: hee dyeth a second death, and all his honour and glory is ended with him in the dust, as Ps. 7. and death triumpheth over him. And as Pride goeth before the fall: so the fall of man, is the trusting in riches, and honour, and letting slip knowledge and understand∣ing & the fear of the Lord. When David seeth this end com of the Rich, whose state all along is contrary, 2. Thes. 1. to his: hee beeing much perplexed with the errors of his life: hee easily concludeth, that by his dayly affliction and misery, hee is therby, to look for eternall comfort, glory and felicity. Therfor hee feareth not but hee shall bee made wise unto salvation, and by correction escape the pit, that his form and shape corrupt not, as Ps· 16. but his faith and rigteousnes shall last for ever. From the fall of Adam, who was turned out of honour for disobedience, Gen. 3. Construction. Mem, waters. For understanding and knowledge, waters of life, the waters of Iudah &c. Is. 48. also riches or abundance of wealth, the Riche-mans way makes him a fool, & no better thā a beast, yf hee wanteth wisdom. Hee seeketh for land & houses to last for ever in his Name: hee findeth suddainly the grave, for his everlasting
dwelling, which shall have the dominion over him, and wear him all to dust, for the let∣ter Tet, and Mot, both the letters, for his translation, such is his passing hence, or demi∣gration, a kinde of passover. The moste illustrious estate in this world, & moste glittering turneth to long lasting obscurity, Eccl. 11. mark the resounding. Man in honour &c. and all the termes doubled. Is. 8.11.32. Ier. 2.51. Exodus. The ninth Petaroth, and chapter 30. for the Sacrifice or offering mony of every person. But that can not redeem from death. No welth is sufficient, but the waters of life and understanding, of knowledge, & of the fear of God. This is the substance hee presumeth on Ps. 16. mark the words of redemption: no man shall redeem, &c: but God will redeem &c. again remember. A kinde of Name is when a man desireth to leave a Memory. PSALM L. THe word of the Everlasting, the God of Godes, by the mouth of Moses in his last testament to the children of Israel: hath been preached in Sion, to all the world, for a warning of his angry, fearfull and horrible judgement of his Law, called a consumeing fire, for falling away & transgression. Now hee, beeing the God that judgeth: calleth heaven and earth to witness of his Iustce, which as in Psalme 40. in the Priestly part of service, is an utter condemnation of sacrifice for the glorifyeing of God. And also of the leviticall part: the usurping of the word, that is, without regard of instruction or observation. Therfor, because hee is a God of mercy, and in his mercy releaseth, when they call on him in distress: hee wil have mercy, and no Sacrifice; a spi∣rituall Thanks-offering, rather then a cloveen footed bullock, Ps. 69. to glorify him: and hee will shew him the way of salvation; least in his wrath, they bee consumeed and de∣voured without deliverance. As gifts are not gratious to the kinde, and as presentes provoke not freendes: and all the glory of freendes, is to bee freely used, and called upon in distress: so al Gods glory is free mercy, and not sacrifice, & to bee wholely, and onely relyed and called upon: because the best sacrifice serveth not in time of judgement: but a penitent invocation in trouble, for him that will be saveed and comforted. And they must have no other freend or God, but him, to worship, to call upon or to serve. And this is for the profession of his deer Saintes, and chosen Servantes, and Elect, men∣tioned in the first table: whom in his Kingdom, hee thus reprooveth, for their drowzi∣nes in observing. Again the wicked are utterly condemned before him, for takeing his name wholely in vain, through out the second table; when hee observeth none of his commandements: but resisteth his will, & breaketh his Law, though it bee in his mouth. To these also belong confession, repentance and amendement, & a calling upon God, yf they will be put in the way of salvation. So that, the book of the Law, the two Ta∣bles beeing opened, and the whole world to bee judged: either for misdooing or not dooing, wee are all condemned, without repentance and the mercy of God. Like the breaking of the Tables, Exo. 31.32. for defect in the holy preesthood & Levites, as well as the wicked. Lev. 6.7. And hee maketh prayer, & the calling upon God, and his Name; better then sacrifice, as grace is ever more worth then wokes. Construction. Nun. Defective. That all are defective by the Law.

See these wordes repeated: Sacrifice to God, &c. Hee that sacrifice-eth Thanks-offering &c. God called a consumming fire, for his Name.
PSALM LI. DAvid takeeth his occasion in this Psalme, to accuse himself, of Murther and Adultery, though hee speaketh but of Murther, which was caused by Adultery. And seeing in his conscience the uglynes of this Sinn and transgression, and the continuall blemish, of his guiltines; and that hee had onely sinned against God, and highly displeased him, by transgressing his word; becaus the fleshly and naturall man had prevailed in him, and that hee had this wickednes in him from the womb, according to the truthe of the Scriptures, as Ps. 58. and God loved the truthe from the hart: and confession beeing requireed, as Ps. 50. and as the story of the Leper doth follow sacrifice in the Law: so heer. And therfor hee turneth his sinning to Lepry; and for his form, proceedeth in the person of a Leper, and prayeth for forgivenes, as a Leper for clensing, Math. 8. Luc. 17. And in this cloud, hee beginneth at the mercy seat, that God would shew his mighty kindenes and mercy upon him, and wipe away all his trespass, and wash away all his sinn, and clens him from the spots of his ini∣quity, which compassed his heeles and marred his goeing, as Ps. 49. and giue him in∣ward wisdom, to sanctifye him and purge him like Issop and clense him: to justify him, and wash him, whiteer then snow, and deliver him out of temptation, and cheer his krokeen bones. That hee would not look upon the sorenes of his sinnes, and that hee would blot out, and deface his iniquity, that hee would clens his corrupt thoughtes and clothe him with a clean skinn, skinn him over again with a right spirit, and make him a new man. That God would not put him out of the Church, for his plague and sores of Sinn, not deprive him, of all his spirit of holynes; but make him glad with his salvation, and sustein him with the spirit of zeal and willingnes: Ps. 145. that hee may convert trespassers and sinners, to the wayes of Godlines. And that the very God of his salvation, would deliver him from Murther, that hee may be able to speake of Gods Iustice, and tell out his Prais. For the Matter, becaus it is the confession, and confidence requireed in the last Psalme, and becaus God refuseeth all other sacri∣fice and offering: hee commeth now with his brokeen and contrite hart, and a minde all in peeces, with greeff for his sinn. That hee would mend up Zion, repair his know∣ledge, and re-edify his understanding, by the walls of Ierusalem, that God may pleas himself, with a perfet offering and sacrifice of righteousnes, when they offer up bul∣locks upon his Altar. Math. 8. Le. 1.14. Construction. Nun defective. His great defect is his sinn, his trespass, his iniquity with all these termes doubled. Aleph to teach; teach mee the wisdom &c.

And save him, make him glad once again, and to rejoyce in him, with righteousnes and prais. Hos. 14 Heb. 13. For an∣other kinde of sacrifice, to perform their promiss in Egypt. a God of Salvation, for his Name. PSALM LII. BEtween us and you is firmed a great gulf, they that would goe from hence to you, cannot, and they that would com from thence to us, cannot. So is the difference and distance between the Rich and the Poor, not small, and the pas∣sage impossible. For when the Poor hath all his hope and trust in God: the
Rich reckoneth not of God at all, haveing gotten what his hart can wish, but blasphem∣eh as Ps. 10. Neither can the Rich-man bee brought to the Poor-mans faith, nor the Poor bee made profane, or can they be reconcileed ech to other; So farr a sunder is Prosperity and Adversity, pride and bashfullnes. Neither by any meanes, can their punishment or reward be changed, so great a firmament, and so unpassible a space is set between them. Disdeigne keepeth off the one, and far, the other. And likewise, when their lots be changeed, the one beeing made happy, the other accursed, to make the righteous mery. And this opposition is good, by the divers and contrary sens of divers wordes in the same Psalme, as Havoth, welth and corruption: Chesed, blasphemy, and kindenes: and Sheresh, in a contrary sens. as Psal. 80. The occasion of this Psalme is Doegs discovery of David, and complaining of his freend Ahimelek, to get his life, and that the Poor, in affliction, might have no place left him at all: and this, by the practise of a keen and subdole tongue, that causeth all mischeeff and division, variance and debate, strife and contention, never to bee reconcileed or appeased more. It is corrupt, and fals, and subdole, and sharp, malitious, and spitefull, and inflameed with blasphemy, and useeth al the wayes of destruction, devouring & subversion: so his judgement must bee to feel eternall flames therin, and his own overthrow from God, and an expelling out of his hous and plantation, and an utter rooting of him out of the world with disgrace, for trusting in his highe place & his welth, because the hevenly Father plāted him not: whē David is still green in the hous of God, with the fayth in his merceyes, and admireing the mighty goodnes and operation of his Name for ever. The form is, from the tree of knowledge of good and evill, and the tree of life Gen. 3. Behold, I put before you, good & bad, life & death, blessing & cursing &c. Now wher the tong should bee kept frō evill, and the lips from guile, and they should hate & shunn evill, & doe good, yf thy mean to have life, and good dayes: as Ps. 97.34. Doeg is blameed heer, for his loveng of ill more then good, and therfor held accursed, and to be throwen out of his habitation, and out of the favour of God. For man liveth not by bead onely, but by the word of God and faith theron. Which is the tree of life, as Psal. 56. The favour of God, Ps. 30. The tree of the everlasting mercyes of God, that are never to bee spent and consumeed: but by faith men gather them continually, like Manna in the wildernes, and they be renewed every morning, allwayes green by a lively fayth. And this is Davids plantation and habitation in the hous of God. The matter is, the abjection, rejection & cōdemnation of the Rich, out of all favour of God: & the everlasting continuance of the Godly, in the bosom of Abraham, and pleasant study of the Law. And as Laza∣rus is raised in David, by prayer, as Ps. 51. by such a faith, to be entertained and com∣forted in heaven: so the rich Doeg is thrown down into torments of disgrace in hell, in this Psalme, by the final judgement of God, that is of a mighty depth, as Ps. 36. and that is an everlasting gulf betwixt them. So as the 50. is for judgement, the 51 and this Psalme, for the partyes: so all are from the Parable, Ps. 49. Construction. The letter Nun, defective: or the word Nun, to spring or grow, or from Nub, Ps. 6.2. to bring forth riches, grow or increas. The whole is defection or affection, and the end, destruction or flowrishing. How the great man misseth, you may see, Ps. 34.97. both in his tongue and affection, delighting in evill, in steed of good, and speaking of falshood. So missing of truth, the fear of God: his life is shortened. David delighteth in the best good: the Mercey and Name of God, and the preaching of that, and outliveth. Beth, hous, and tabernacles &c. thou lovest &c. twise. Exodus. The life that pleaseth God, or that God commandeth, is in steed of a service and sacrifice unto God: and heer David sacrificeth his whole time to the word of God. For the fear of God, as Psal. 34. his trust beeing called his Strength, for another of Godes Names. PSALM LIII. THer is no folly so great as the denyeing of God, and who is so foolish as my people, sayth God? with their filth an abominable wrong, that maketh them stink in his
sight. Ierusalem had many eyes, yet could they not see what belonged to their peace. Pride and prodigality throweth them out of their estates, sinn, and transgression of the Law of God, whippeth them out of doores, like the rod upon the fooles back. For disobe∣dience, they are made dsolate, the flood hath swept them clean away, they are cast into prison, and utter daknes, and obscureity, and carryed into a lamentable captivity, wher is nothing but weeping and howling, till their tongues be drye, & on fire, and their harts burn with horror and wrath and sorrow, and they have no comfort. In this horrible affliction and torment, they call, and cry pittiously for Ierusalem again, and for som of the joyes and praises of Sion, the place of their salvation, to tip their tongues and refresh them. And this is the occasion. The form is from Adams expulsion out of Paradise, Gen. 3. as all the heavens are Gods, but the earth is given to the children of men: Ps. 115. so God haveing placed man, innocent upon the earth: hee by and by groweth full of corruption, and moste abominable for wrong dealing. Then God looketh out of the highest heavens, and asketh for him, and out of the Scriptures, hee inquireeth for his in∣nocencey, and his wisdom in seeking of God: and they play all hid, and no such man was to bee found, no, not one good man at all, as Ps. 12. They all stink with abomina∣ble corruption & folly, and goe backward, and dare not com foorth; but are a frayed & abashed, that God hath forsaken them, because they are expelled for their trespass, and their bones all scattered in captivity. Shall wee sinn that grace may abound? God for∣bid, sayth the Apostle: So, all molesters and workers of Mischeff, that call not upon God, eat of the tree of life, and devoure it like bread, destroy the Scriptures, and make havok of the word, and spend the mercyes of God, and waste and consume the people of God, and eat up the Church with profanenes. So, the question is not, wher man is, but wher a good-man is, and ther is no such, which is the Mystery of this Psalme, by repe∣tition of the wordes. The matter, wherby it hangeth to the former Psalme is, that they all love falshood more then truthe, and wrong more then righteousnes: and therfor they re∣ceiue the wages of sinn, which is death, because they loved not life, nor the word of God that should save their soules. Construction. Nun, to spring or grow: the contrary is to fade, or to be defective. So the wicked are, in the fear of God, in dooing of good, as Ps. 34. or of wisdom, in not calling upon him. Ghimel, to doe good: so bothe the Wiseman and the Goodman is wan∣ting, by their workes. Both the letters make Nag, of Nagah, to be cleer. Mark the doubling of the termns, and it will express the intendement. Exodus. The Fear, for the fear of God, and the dispair that the wicked make. Because God, the Fear that guardeth them that fear him, and worship him, Psal. 34. hath scattered them. The not serving of God, because hee lets his people goe into captivity, doth much hurt among them, and freats them, and much dismayes them: therfor they pray for re∣turn. The people are not in the right fear, and ther is a defect in the service, and the Sa∣crifice is reprooved: as yf it would bee mended, yf God would releas his people. For with them, ther is no God, or els they dispair of the right God &c. So the termnes Fear, and God, are equall heer, and the one soundes to the other, to express the same. As the Fear of Isaack, for the God of Isaack. Gen. 31. PSALM. LIV. SAtan shall seek to fann and winnow you like wheat, and som of you shall hee cast into prison. Ther is no safe place for the man of God, but the divill and tirants will finde him out and beewray him; strangers and such as have no respect of God at all, as Ps. 53. as were the Zips, which made haste to tell Saul, as soon as they could discry him, amongst them. And thus bee all placees sifted for him, that hee can have no rest, which maketh him in the next Psalme, wish for the wings of a dove, to fly from them far enough, into the wildernes, for rest: and all is for his life. This sheweth that the rich hath many freendes, and all places will serv the mighty. Wherever David goeeth, or wherever hee hide-eth, Saul can hear of him. Sayth Eliah, they have slain thy Prophetes, and I onely am left alive, and they seek my life; the same may bee sayed
of David and more: ther is onely one good man left, and one after Gods own hart, and they seek his life: but this is the hower & power of darknes. From these, David prayeth, that seeing all their dooing is against God and his word; and that God is all his help and confidence: and the Lord is with them that sustein him: that hee would by his victo∣rious Name, and light of his word, defend him and save him; and reward his Enimyes with the evill, and destroy them, as Ps. 89. according to his promiss. That hee may li∣berally and freely sacrifice to him, and worship his beneficiall Name, and his word, and the calling upon him, for delivering him from all distress, to stand in the face of his Eni∣mye and behold him. Construction. Nun, defective. The whole is upon desolation, resisting and depriva∣tion, as strangers and aliens, and cruell ones, & they that are clean without God, Eph. 2. that seek his life, on the one part: and on the contrary: Assisting, saveing and defen∣ding, by the great calling upon God. According to the word, Nun, to spring or wax great, Ps. 72. Daleth, a door, for the enterteynment of his prayer, from the door of his mouth, Psal. 141. Mich. 7. door of utterance, Col. 4. Nod a fugitive for another kinde of defection. Exodus. His Free will offering, shall bee his commendation of prayer, & the Name of God, for his deliverance and salvation, and for the great benefit of calling upon him, as you may see, by the entrance, and conclusion, by the repetition. His victorious Name, &c. the goodnes of his Name &c. And this for another kinde of sacrifice, and a reasonable serving of God, Rom. 12. according to their promiss in Aegypt. For his virtue, the rigteousnes of his Name, and goodnes that attended Moses, Exod. 33. against them, because they were opposite. PSALM LV. BEeing in a mighty agony for the rebellion of his sonn Absolom, and revolting of his privy counseller, Ahitophel, his usual companion, as Ps. 62. (of which hee could not beware, because of trust, nor bear it) and for the seditious trechery of the Citty, and lamentable and mischevous deceipt, that Ierusalem was full of: & the mischeeffs in their dwelling houses, which was intolerable: when they strike hand, (beeing secure) and perform not: and speak fair wordes and cut his throat: whom hee was now fallen foul on: David prayeth for speedy conveiance out of it, into the wil∣dernes, from the hurly burly of it, and by the wings of a dove; which hee makeeth his providence upon the Eternall; in whom hee trusteth, to whom hee greatly complaineth, & upon whom hee allwayes calleth for deliverance: for confusion of their tongues for unjust contention. That they may swallow their tongues, and eat their own threatnings. That they may feel death and hell, in their lives likewise, and torments, by a pit of de∣struction. And as they are Murtherers, and Traitors, and shorteners of life: so that they may not reach out half their time; that hee may have peace, for the warr they make him. And this hee prayeth the Almighty, that is allwayes present, with them, and knoweth their mindes: to answer them; their dissembling beeing unanswerable by man. His re∣quest in this Psalme, is deliverance from guile, and injury, the breed of deceipt and cor∣ruption, and viperousnes, which is contention, and strife, and that by degradation in bo∣dyes politique, from the highest, to the lowest. In the Citty, it is every wher: upon the walles, in the streetes, and in their dwelling houses, and among freendes, as falshood in fellowship continually. Vpon the walles: they are traitors, in their streetes: cousseners and in their houses: hypocrites, and with their freendes: dissemblers and fals bretheren, shewing that no watch is sufficient against these, as Psal. 127. and no Enimy so dangerous. Therfor, all day long, hee teacheth to watch and pray to bee defended from them, and Especially from fals companions: which are moste mischeevous & hard to bee avoyded. Thes doth Christ call ravening wolves in sheeps clothing; that the subdolity of Serpents nor innocencey of dooves can beware of, though the one bee wise, & the other God de∣fendes. This is frameed from the subdolity of the Serpent, that was a lyer and a mur∣therer from the beginning, Gen. 3. By expressing all the propertyes and partes of
knavery, and wickednes, and is the corruption spoken of Psal. 52.53. Construction. Nun, defective, for the whole defect of the Citty, which hee sheweth: the policy shall bee overthrowen. Hee telleth of his defect. Complaineth unto God: upon the letter and term He, behold, for presence, loe, the open and plain man. Vpon the contrary, hee prayeth God not to conceal himself &c. hee would lodge in the wildernes &c, far enough off: his neer companion that knew his counsell &c. dissimulation, and God that inhabiteth presence: hee that presenteth himself unto God, God will mainteyn him, & the just shall never fleet away &c. Thes all bee kindes of presence, & what neerer, than his great agony, and fear that hee was dayly put in, by them? And such a lamentable state it is, that hee so damneth to hell, and destruction, and bewaileth. Nah, from Nahah to lament, consider the wordes complaining, and crying out, repeated &c. Exodus. Offer your presents to God: cast your providence upon him &c. your sa∣crifices of prayer and faith unto him, Hos. 12. your dayly oblation: evening and morning and at noon, like himself. Alway present him, put him in minde, and call on him, for a kinde of presence & sacrifice. Object your faythfullnes & your prayer & offer righteous∣nes, and hee will sustein and releev you, and you shall never be cast away, nor rejected. Gods Name heer, is the God of peace: by the opposition of the Termes: peace and warr repeated. PSALM LVI. FOxes have holes, and the birdes of heaven have nests: but the sonn of man hath no place to rest his head. Whither shall David fly? hee is every wher beewrayed, and Saul is at his heeles, driveing him at last into the net, hunting him into his Enimyes handes. Hee that so often, and so sore daunted the Phelists, his sore-est Enimyes: as Ps. 9.10, 27. must now fly for succour to them. What a case was this? wher they hold counsell of his fidelity, and seek his life, to suppress him. But in distress, hee is made resolute, by the word of God. Therfor hee is thankfull for his deliverance out of his fear, when hee cryed, and prayeth God to pitty him. The form is from, Gen. 3. I will put Enimity between thee and her, and between thy seed and her seed, hee shall bruse thy head, and thou shall hurt his heel. The strife is, his serpentlike Enimyes are in∣numerable, and shall never rest afflicting, greeving and tormenting of him, and perpetual∣ly strive to oppress him, and dayly contend for the upper hand of him. And shall all∣wayes watch his heeles, & bee still pryeing at his cours and cariage of his life, to cast him, and destroy him, as Psal. 17. And such is the snakynes of Saul, and viperousnes of the Phelists, for secret mischeeffs, and privy conspiracy against him, beehinde his back, his hunting of him, & lying in wait for him, whithersoever hee goeth: & thus doth the serp¦ent his Enimy, tread upon his heeles, and hurteth his life and letteth his way. How can a mā goe, when his Enimy treds on his heeles? yet for all this hee is not afrayd, because of his trust in God (which hee thanketh his word for) of any thing they can doo unto him. But prayeth God, to beat them away for their molestation. And dash them, and throw them down by his angry countenance, and consider, with what greeff and how often, hee had been forced to fly, and remember it. At which mone, and complaint, and cry unto God, and his faith in him and his word, hee seeth his Enimyes turn back: hee presume∣eth then that God is with him, & that with his presence hee hath now broke-en the ser∣pents head, as Psal. 9.48. by turning his Enimy from his purpose, that made head against him. Thus to make the Enimy to turn head, and the serpent to creep into his hole again, is sayd to break or bruse his head, or frustrate his devises, as Ps. 74. The mystery is seen, by and between the report and bringing again, of thes wordes: In God I put my trust, I fear not, &c. His dayly contention, and his trust in God. The matter is his faith, which hee obteineth by the light & wisdom of the word, & presence of God. That cutt∣eth off the fingers of the wicked, and makeeth them loose their hold, and disappointes them: and continueth moste lily, from Psal. 52.54.55. and is able to knock his migh∣tyest Enimyes in the head, and confound them. Construction. For Nun, deficient: they seek utterly to devoure him, and to con∣strein
him even out of this life. and used all devises to make him to fall. Mark the doubling of the first wordes. for this hee wisheth their destruction and his own preser∣vation, which hee findeth, and is thankfull. Vau, the second letter, a hook or crook. is for fear, to this is opposed boldnes, faith and confidence, both the letters beeing, Nau, of Navah, to prais, or adorn, Exo. 15. all which you shall finde in the same re∣petition: In God I prais his word, &c. Exodus. The Sacrifice heer, is praising of God, which they vowed in Egypt, to per∣form, after their deliverance. And this he promisseth to pay; as Ps. 50. for the defeat of his Enimy, and his own preservation, which is upright with the construction also. For his Name Immanuel God with us, Is. 7. If God bee with us, &c. Ro. 8. PSALM LVII. ALexander the Coppersmith did Paul much harm, but the Lord delivered him out of that lions mouth: so David is delivered out of the mouth of Saul, at his request to God, by the protection of Gods word, called the shadow of his wings, as Ps. 36. and his way of loveing kindenes and truthe, fayth and love, which hee counteth a wonderfull worke: and therfor hee extolls his glory over all the world, and with all his instruments, sets out the highth of his love, and faithfullnes of his promiss: the highe tree of the mercyes of God: and among all people and nations is thankfull to him. Neither doo the wicked loos their reward: they lay nets to catch them selves, and digg pitts and fall into them. This Psalme concernes the former by the same form. It is framed from the Enimnity between the serpents seed, and seed of the woman; the one beeing the seed of warr, and the other of peace. The Serpents and Enimyes of Gods word: sow sedition, strife, emulation, contention, debate and discord: they sow speares, & arrows, & swordes, by back-byteing and gnaw∣ing, brawling, quarelling, bitter and cursed speaking, as Ps. 14.53. never hearkening to the way of peace, but are all for warr, as Ps. 120. and from hence is that fine Meta∣morphosis of the Poet: wher the Serpents teeth beeing sowen, ther grow up armed men. So biteing language is the seed of armes, and hot and inflameed mouthes, and fals tonges, are weapons of warr. Now the womans seed and the Churches, is nothing but the way of God, which is mercey and love, and truthe, with lips unfeined, as Ps. 17. sowing concord and peace. as Ps. 108. And therfor now, David beeing saveed by God, his hart brings foorth lutes, and harps, and viols, and is all for musicque, and instruments of peace, and is ready to sing, and set foorth his glory, as Ps. 145. that hee may be heard beyond all nations, and his noyse above the cloudes, for his delivrance. The Mystery is shewed by thes wordes, and, Gloria in excelsis, reported and repeated. Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory over all the earth. The Matter is, his faith in the green tree of the merceyes of God, as Ps. 52. and the highth of his love and promiss, as Ps. 89. which is above all reach, and shall bruse the serpents head, as Ps. 56.74. Construction. Nun defective, devouring is for defection. The devourer is devour∣ed, and the patient preserved. The one waiteth all corruption and falshood, reproch and disgrace, and detraction: according to bothe the letters. Naz, of Nazah, to sprinckle, as a kinde of sprinckling or aspersion. The other waites for Grace and truthe, to defend him, and calleth upon God the high: to glorify him. as Ps. 50. And by his induring and calling on God, how mightyly his glory is exalted. mark the repetition. Zain to hear or conceive, or listen, hee will open the eares, or the daughters of Musicque, Eccl. 12. by his musicque, and make them hear. As by the coactive, for a kinde of hearing. Exodus. His calling upon God in this misery, and his whole relyeing on him: ser∣veth for a sacrifice and a glory to him, as Ps. 50. in thes wordes: I call unto God &c. the Almighty &c. For the Elect, Calamity is shortened, Math. 24. and passeth over, and the righteous are mightyly redeemed. So is Gods Glory the more mightyly ad∣vanced, and to bee extolled: the harder the deliverance is. For it is full of grace and
truthe, Ioh. 1. in saveing, God giveth both grace and glory, all the good that can bee, for trusting in him, Ps. 84. therfor the same is to be ascribeed to him, in the highest, for the power of it. the Name Elyon, for the extolling, &c. PSALM: LVIII. BEcaus the wicked doo allwayes wrong, in thought word and deed, and miss, and lye in all thinges, Psalm. 1. by reason of their furey and rage, which is deaff to all reason and instruction; and will no more be pacifyed and perswadeed (like a spitefull and rageing Enimye) then a serpent or a lion; no, not by the wiseest Moderator, from their work of backbiteing and devouring talk: therfor Davids prayer is, that their serpentlike biteing teeth, and their devouring grinders (the seed of armes) may be brokeen in pecees, as Ps. 3. That their Arrowes of bitter wordes, their endles aimes, as Ps. 64. may bee shunned, as easy as water, and beeing brokeen, they and all their worke miscarry with unripenes, & melt away: that it never com to ffect nor see the sunn. That his choler may moste speedyly boil him alive, for his defeat, and the just may be comforted with their revenge, and victory over the wicked: and that men may bee sure and confess, seeing som mens works goe before unto Iudge∣ment, and som mens follow after: that ther is fruit for the just, and ther bee Gods that are Iudges in the earth. This Psalme from, Iob 19. deserveth to bee written with a pen of iron, and carved in stone for Eternity, and drawen with lead that never may goe out. God will judge every deed, sayth Salomon, and bring all a mans life in quest∣ion, and draw all his actions to judgement, whether they bee good or bad. Therfor David from his enimyes wicked life: and the nature of the Serpent, draweth a con∣demnation, and out of the experience of his tribulations, cannot but hope for an end of him. And thus hee prayeth according to the curs, as Ps. 109. That seeing hee can neither speak nor judge aright, but all wrong and injury is in his hart and handes, to recompens, as Ps. 5.52.140. and his minde doth ponder nothing els, and is fals as soon as hee is born, with incorrigible error and malice: hee entreth into this curs and prayer against him, as Ps. 109.140. as against a murtherer and a temper from the be∣ginning. That all his instruments may bee brokeen, that hee may bee easyly avoyded, that his way may perish, Ps. 1. and himself enter into consumption, as followeth. That his falshood may com to nothing, and melt, and not be able to abide the Sunn, but to bee suppressed for ever: which is the cursed groveling of the wicked in the Ground, never to look up, beeing ashameed of the sunn. And his Enimyes licking of the dust, as Ps. 72. And for his Malice: that as soon as the pot is over, that it may bun; so, that his own rancor may burn him and consume him, as soon as hee is offended. The end is, that the Iust may bee cheered for his victory, even his faith: that his Enimy is ashameed of all his wayes, and hath no fruit or comfort of them: and that ther is fruit and reward for the just, that they are revenge-ed of the wicked, by the judgement of God, that payeth every man according to his work. as Ps. 62. And this from thes wordes of the Curs: Cursed art thou above all creatures, upon thy belly shalt thou goe and dust shalt thou eat all dayes of thy life. Gen. 3. Construction. For Nun defective: hee speaketh of a generall defection in the sinn∣ing partes: the tong, the eares, the hart and handes. The tong is tyed from good and so are the eares stopped, for hearing of good, the minde is all buissyed about wrong, and the handes with injury. And all that they pronounce, is nothing but error and falshood. Therfor, that they may be made defect in their pronunciation, by breaking of their teeth and their Iawes: and their arrowes, according to the letter, Heth, to break, Another de∣fection is, in consuming, and another, to bee an abortive, never to bee any thing, or never born. Another, that as soon as they live and have life, they bee tormented, Is. 9. for the two letters Nach for rest, as they be all straying and erring, and will not be instruc∣ted: so that they may bee restless. The whole subject is all of wrong. Exodus. Hee dealeth heer upon the privative. The sacrifice and burnt offe∣ring of the children of wrathe. for a defect of all righteousnes, to oppose the sacrifice
therof, as Psal. 4. Deut. 33. that all wrong dealing may stopp his mouth. For hee con∣cludeeth that ther is a reward of righteousnes, as Rom. 6. Mat. 6. Gen. 4. And as the wicked are wrong in all their actions: so is their end utter destruction, and that by a righ∣teous judgement & revenge upon them, even in the earth. So among the rest, such saci∣fice also they used in the wildernes. Gods, amed judges &c. by the first and last wordes, and God, the God of revenge, as Ps. 94. PSALM LIX. VPon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eat all dayes of thy life. The divill, like a roring lion seeketh to devour all hee can. To this text hee brin∣geth the strong appetite of the Hethen, to deuour the church of God: and Sauls appetite to the life of David: and thus they goe all upon the belly, like hungry dogs about the town, to satisfy themselves with the lives of the just. Their ap∣petite is sharp, they lye in wait moste secretly, and bable much with their mouthes, they slay him, with proud words behinde his back, Ps. 94. but God sets him before their face, as Ps. 92. and wills them and commands them, not medle with his people that have their trust and confidence in him, and laughs at their secrecy and promisseth o preserve him. Against these, hee prayeth God, the Churches Lord and Defendour, o quash them, and debase them, and prostrate them, and subject them by his power: to bring them down, and subdue them: and powre them strait along, as durt in the street, as Ps. 18. And that none may hear them, none may take them up, none may saue them, none may pitty them, that they may never rise again to afflict him. And that God would make runa∣gates of them, and vagabundes like Cain, and bring them to the lowest degree, and scatter them as dust before the winde, as Ps. 1.68. That their state may bee a cursed state. And as pride goeth before the fall: so that by their pride (like Lucifer) they may bee takeen and cast down into hell, as accursed; and that the cursses of their own mouthes, and ill wishes towards him, and proud pursuit of him for his life; and their bloody mindes: may all com home to themselves, as Ps. 63.64. and work their own destruction, and consume them. And that God would in this very rage destroy them, wherby they are offended and angry at him: to teach them, that God will bee master and have domi∣nion in Iacob, and in all the world also. And so they may goe like hungry dogs about the town, murmuring and curssing, and beg from door to door: as Ps. 73.109. and never bee satisfyed. And as hee is bound to sing of the firmnes and strength of Gods promiss, and his loveing kindenes, for his escape and refuge, in his affliction and sore distress: so to his strength and confidence and the God of his mercey, hee will sing in Psalmes for his escape. Construction. For Nun, defective. They seek heer, deprivation of his life that had no defect in him, neither sinn nor trespass, nor iniquity, they beeing both bloody & cursed, which maketh the equity of his salvation and preservation, and their damnation, with utter destructon prayed for, that they may like doges never be satisfyed: Is. 56. And let them goe yelling, &c. which wordes bee curiously doubled, to shew want and misery for their greedynes. And from Nat, and Natah, to decline or bring down, Ps. 17. their base life as vagabundes, to buissy them: according to the title: that they hurt him not, though they wait to kill him. Against their strengh of persecution: hee applyeth Gods strength, the Ark and truth of his word, for his Garison and salvation, which hee obser∣veth. And his kindenes in rewarding, as Ps. 62. Thes wordes com often also, to make them notable. Exodus. Hee intendeth heer, the sacrifice of fooles, that are hasty to vow: as vowes, for the sinn of the mouth, Eccles. 5. Deut. 23. beeing with much pride, and much furey uttered, much swearing, much curssing, much lyeing, and deceiving: and with thes ginnes, hee would haue them taken, and destroyed for their defect. Like the vow of conspira∣cey, against Paul: Actor. 23. The God of Releeff: for strength and kindnes, repeated. Psal. 8.144
PSALM LX. THe promisses of God doe hold the Church to their faith, and they are sweet, all yea and Amen. And by Gods promiss in the Scripture, they all hold, and live, and are refreshed, because hee is mercyfull in them all, and faithfull to the end. The Church is often sick & diseased, but through faith they are recovered and made whole. The Sicknes of the people of God, is persecution, and famine of the word, and tottering in religion, yet, as long as the fire is not quite out, and faith quite ex∣tinguished, and their knowledge of the word, quite decayed: ther is no fear of death. And this is the hope that David hath, when the people of God are even at deathes door, as Ps. 9. even his beloveed, whom hee would so fain have refreshed, healed and released. The wrath of God for sinn causeth all diseases: so hee falleth into an enumeration of them, by the shakeing, cleaving, breaking, and dissolution of the earth. Which is for their infidelity, their strife among themselves, their sedition, muteny, and discord, loosnes and unconstancy; and because they have been put to much hardnes, and were made giddy, & faint harted, with the cup of their adversity, Ier. 48. and could not tell what to doe: they now, beeing in this Acatastasy, and unsetlednes, and not knowing what to think: hee remembreth by Gods word, what Nations were to com in, and that the world was not quite at an end, with them; but as the Priests lips preserves knowledge: so they yeld also faith. Therfor, hee prayeth for Gods right hand called his Ministry, their oracle and ad∣vise, to save them. From whence they haue this assurance from the word, that God will fall to shareing of the world, and to partition of the Nations, to inlarge the borders of the Church. That Shechem should bee divideed, and Succoth measured. That hee would haue Gilead and Manasses his own. Ephraim should bee confirmed unto him, and Iudah should be written and conveyed. That hee would wash his feet, and take pos∣session in Moab. And put off his shoos, and take his rest in Edom. And triumph, & keep holy day in Phelistia. And out of this promiss, the Church doth hope for victory over all their Enimyes. For this hee thanketh God for their salvation, and prayeth still for his most prosperous help, to tread down the Serpent, as Ps. 92. and vainquish their Enimyes for them, as Ps. 108. Construction. Samek, to uphold: it is heer taken all along, for help and salvation, as Isai. 63. as, O consider, and help &c. and O give us help. And arm thy beloved &c. God sheweth the Assistantes, and the strength of the Church: when it felt all kinde of weakenes, when God stood not to them, but forsook them. Ther is nothing shewed but dissolution and susteyning. And that God is their onely stay. Exodus. From Isa. 34. To kill Gods Enimyes is good service: so that this great slaughter is counted for a sacrifice, as that in Bozra and Edom, according to the title. See Ier. 49. Ezech. 25.35. Iehovah Nissi, Exod. 17. God, his standard. PSALM. LXI. DAvid haveing fled out of the land for Absolom, and beeing now faint and fee∣ble harted in his old age, and allmoste out of the world also, for greeff of hart, because hee was absent farr from the Church of God: prayeth God, as hee had been his relye and strong tower from the Enimyes, which is the instruction of the Ark: that hee would safe-conduct him by that highe Rock also, the word, as Ps. 27.18. to his Tabernacle. That ther, hee might now dwell for ever, relyeing under his winges, which is the Cherubs, his Mercey. And as God giveth possession to them that fear him: the Israelites after 40 yeers in the wildernes: so that hee would hearken to his wishes, now after his reigne of 40 yeers: and ad abundance of yeers more unto them: that hee might abide still in the presence of God, preserved by loveing kindenes and truth, his portion, his meat, his Manna. And as Ps. 81. paying hi vowes, and chaunting his Name for ever. After the Tower, the Ark and mercy seat, Rock and Manna. And seeing by the Scriptures, the way is to pleas God, and get up to his tabernacle, and dwell
with him, as Ps. 15. and to obtein the habitation of godlynes, and Mount of holynes, and heighth of sanctification, as in the Psalmes of degrees: which are their shelter and tower of defens, and safety, from the floodes of wicked Enimyes, by the quiet wa∣ters of refreshing, flowing from them, Ps. 23. When Davids hart fainted: hee knoc∣keth at this Rock, and prayeth for direction thither, to receiue a heavenly possession, with them that fear God, and length of dayes, and all requests, by the sustenance therof, the way of godlynes; grace and truthe. Psal. 25. That feeding heerupon, as upon unperishing Manna, hee may bee allwayes preserved by God, to serve him. And this is the spirituall rock of Christ, that followed the Host, and served Israel, and was the Exodus, and Passage, and conveyance of them. 1. Cor, 10. Construction. Samec, is heer taken passively, as Nismac, to rely, or lean upon. As in a feeble estate, by repeating the word rely. And the reckoning up of all his stayes, the rock for a guide, Tabernacle and tower, and cherubs, and kindenes and truthe, for preservation. Aleph for instruction or education, is signifyed by the rock, & tower whose top reacheth to heaven, and is a name exalted so much in all the world, by prayer and prais. Sa, of Nasa, both the letters, to lift up. Exodus. They that fear the Name of God, shall have the possession of all that they long for. then vowes upon condition are due, for hearkening to their wishes: they must make unto God full satisfaction, and pay their vowes: and this serveth for a sacri∣fice in the wildernes also. as by the doubling of the word vowes. His vow heer is, an everlasting devotion, yf God will give him dayes. As by the termes of eternity, so oft repeated. God, his Rock. 1. Cor. 10. For his susteining. PSALM LXII. ILL Servants marr good children. The subtilty and reach of Ahitophel, Davids counseller, hit upon the pride and vanity of Absolom, his sonn, as Ps. 55. and puffed him up to rebellion, to rob his father of his subjects and kingdom. The matter now beeing at open hostility, and they in counsell agreeing to a murtherous practise upon his person; for it: yet David by a cleer judgement, faileth not of his faith and trust in God; nor doubteth of his salvation, as Ps. 42. but is sure of his re∣deemer, Iob. 19. and that hee shall not bee overthrowen, bcaus they bee lovers of fals∣hood, and dissembling traitors, that seek his life: the Godhead of truth and Iustice; and the strength of the word, called his rock, beeing the glory of his salvation and relye: and willeth to all his people, that from their hartes they utter the same profession. And seeing the children of men are more fals and light than vanity it self: they should not trust to bee rich or strong, by robbery or oppression, Ps. 17. becaus all strength is Gods, that still prevaileth, and Kindenes, that rewardeth every man aright. which is; according to his request, Ps. 55. to his Enimyes: half their dayes, by a desperat end to Ahitophel, for miscarrying of his wisdom: and the foolish end of Absolom, for his vain hope. The Church, as it is Catholicque, and also holy: so it doth hold, either by the Law, or by the Promiss. By the Law, it standeth in performance, and that is impossible for the flesh, by reason of weaknes, and sinn, and condemnation and death enter therupon: and the letter killeth, which is the face of the church, but the minde and spirit of God, which quickneth every man unto eternall life, is by the Promiss, which is holy: of things unseen, gracees and mercyes of God, and forgivenes, and a better and an everlasting life, by fayth and hope, and this knoweth no man but the holy spirit of God in man. And thus is faith the rock to build upon, as divers times in the word, wherby hee payeth every man according to his work, and judgeth all men according to their minde. As the minde is conteined in the body: so the Pro∣miss is the soul of the Law, and as wee are forbid to care for the body: so the church is commanded to provide for the soul, to cast them selves upon God, to seek content∣ment by a gratious government, and let all rudiments goe. And this is his sure rock of victory and of salvation, even his faith. Construction. Heer, Samc, is taken passively also, shewing his relye, repose and trust:
and the strength of his support, which is God. The weaknes of the poples confidence that trust in the vanity of misgotten riches, or in the falshood of Man. Ps. 146. Beth, a house, they thrust hard at him, and set upon him, to overthrow and beat down all his rise∣ing, and his exaltation and dignity of his hous, and to ruine all his repose by falshood. which is a kinde of dwelling of the minde. Sab to compass or inviron, Gods wall about him, which is his kindenes grace & favour, Ps. 21. cannot bee beaten down, it is so strong. And this confidence deceiveth no man, but payeth every man for his travaile. Exodus. Hos. 12. The people play the crafty merchants, in sacrificeing their mis∣gotten welth, and set their mindes wholely therupon for their salvation: wher their faith is reprooved. Beeing in an opposite cours to the sacrifices of righteousnes, Ps. 4. & faith of David, which is counted righteousnes. so hee dealeth by privation. Every one that worketh righteousnes is accepted with God. &c. Marke the repetition of termes concerning all pointes. God, his rock and trust. PSALM LXIII. ASk and you shall receive, and seek and you shall finde, and knock and it shall bee opened unto you. In the Last Psalme, 62. hee sheweth that his life is sought by flaterers and dissembling hypocrites, that use smooth wordes, and have throtes like open graves, and wicked and corrupt thoughtes to devour him, and gape wide to receive him, as Ps. 5. wher hee casteth off his confidence in Man, for vanity: and welth that groweth by wrong, hee counteth nothing worth, to save him: and therfor relyeth wholy upon the strength of the kindenes and mercyes of God. Heer they seek his life with the sword, and hunt him into holes and corners of the earth: and in this, for playing the foxes with him: hee prayeth, that foxes may prey upon them, and baite upon them in the ground, and that hee may bee mery and have good cheer in the hous of God, as Psal. 23; and be ravished with his glory, and releeved with the living waters of his mercy, which hee counteth better then life: that hee may bless and prais his Name for ever, and all their treacherous mouthes may bee stopped. That this may bee: hee knocketh at the word of Grace, beeing athirst in the wildernes, for waters of the scripture to refresh him. Which wildernes hee maketh his solitary bed, as often as hee awakes and thinks on him, then to call upon him. That hee himself may rejoyce in God, and all may boast and glory to bee sworn in him. Construction. Samec, again for the function of Godlynes, the work of relyeing, dayly adoration, and admiration of his strength, and glory and commendation, for his grace: as thanks of triumph, after great good cheer of his mercyes; dayly conversation and comunication with him. Ghimel, for Ghamul, a wainling, as hee was, from all his affections, in the wildernes. Sag, both the letters, to depart, or goe back. This sense shineth through the whole Psalme, beeing contrary to Appetition, longing and adheering, which is the whole tenor therof, Zeph. 1. mark the report of the phrase, Davids seeking of God, and his Enimyes seeking of him. Exodus. The first of Zephany also, shall shew what sacrifice the Lord will som∣time have, and what sacrifice is heer ment by the fullnes of the termes, and sense of this psalme, in it: destruction of them that turn from the Lord, and them that seek him not. That they, that play the foxes and betray him, may have a foxes part, in the wildernes, Eze. 13. their trecherous mouthes stopped in the earth, God will have his sacrifice aswell of his own sworn children, that depart from him: as of them that be devoted to other Gods, and have never yet served him. He will serve him self out of all sortes, when he ordeineth a destruction. PSALM LXIV. COnsidering the deadly fear of persecution which David felt, as Psal. 55. the sharpnes and egernes of his Enimyes dayly plots, and secret conspiracy for his life: to kill a just man, without fear, and to compass it suddainly, by means
not to be descryed, nor discovered by any eye: by deep prying into his hart and all his wayes, rekoning that none can see them: hee prayeth to bee delivered from this hor∣ror. And as Servantes make their quarell, their maisters: so David concluding, that they conspire against God, belyeing him, because hee seeth all their dooings, and giveth warning in the hart, by som passion and light of every action: hee prayeth, that God may give them a just recompens, by this meanes of their own inventiō. That their own recko∣ning may fall upon them, that their own tonges that belye him, may bee true upon them∣selves: to strike them sudainly, that they never see the stroke, till it light upon them, and they feel it to destruction. That the very standers-by man perceiue the plain judgement of God upon them, and that the just may rejoyce, and glory in their relying in him. O full of all subtilty, the childe of the Divill, and Enimy of all righteousnes. This is the man hee feareth, this is hee that hee cryeth out upon, to bee defended, and his life to bee pre∣served from. That hee fall not into his handes: whom hee describeeth by his practise and combination: the secret pryeing and conspiracy against him, and creeping into his bosom to beguile him; by plotting and consulting against him, as the Hethen doe in the same termes, Ps. 2. This man is above all the Enimyes in the world to bee feared, Ps. 55. This man keeps him company to Church and home, prayes with him, and eates with him, and lernes with him, and holdes with him, as yf hee wear of the same religion, and Diet with him, and all to devour him. What beast or fowl is so wilde, or so vigilant to look to his life, that dayly conversation will not tame and beguile, and in time, secure him? Against such a one, a man hath need to bee awake, and watch early and late and at noon day, Ps. 55. mischeevous, greevous, hurtfull and moste dangerous men: As great Enimyes, as Satan, and mischevous as the Divill, as subdole as the Serpent, and as holy as an Angel; to deceiue the Angells, yea yf it were possible, the very Elect. Wherfor all his attributes are given in the contrary sens, as naked for subdole & covered, as Gnarum. which in this Psalme is remembred, Mar, and Rang, bitter and bad, from Merignim. This is the fowler, Ps. 91. And the schoolfellow, Psal. 55. That fetcheth him off, and hee shall never know who hurt him: so all his wayes and words are bitter and distastfull, and cut like a rasor, and are deadly and mortall, because they are fals and deceitfull and damnable. Now because to live in fear of such a one, is a terrible thing: hee complai∣neth greatly of this terror of an Enimy, and prayeth that hee may not live in fear of such a one, but that God would preserve his life from such a fear; which fear is expressed, Ps. 55. It is dolorous, and with pangs within one, it is as cruell as death it self, falling upon one, inexorable crueltyes, as of death, a trembling fear, that assailes him, and sets upon him, and befalls him, and buffeteth him, as it did Paul. Hee is overcom with hor∣ror. And this is the fear hee prayeth to bee freed of, and the Enimy that hee would have terribly cut off: by his own wayes, and perish by his own traps. That the just and plain meaning men that trust in God: with great joy, may admire and acknowledge his work, and prais him. Construction. Samec, to uphold. Hee sheweth heer the privative therof, and the contrary, by the effect of bad tonges, that by slander, backbiteing, & scandall, overthrow men, as a bad report and an ill name doth hange one. This they doe with boldnes and assurance, artificially and stoutly: which is as a kinde of door, emptines or opening, as for Daleth, the second letter. The contrary heerunto is fear, that hath no comfort or re∣lying. Both the letters make Sod, a secret or counsel, and shew all along so much, by the termes, and phrases, hide snares and serch &c. with the contrary. So all is, secret or pub∣ilique, fear or confidence, susteining or overthrowing. Exodus. In the Law, all Sacrifice must bee found and perfect, and without blemish: or any ill thing, Lev. 22. Deut. 17.15. heer: the most holy and precious service of the wic∣ked is, the maiming, spotting and staining of all integrity, syncerity, and soundnes of upright and perfect men. And by detraction and defamation, to marr their reputation, even by transcending and mounting up to their thoughtes: their closenes, and deep di∣veing into the conscience and minde of them. And slaughter of the tong, as Ier. 18. by way of privation, a Sacrifice of wrongs, or Burnt-offering, of dayly consumming greeff, molestation and vexation.
PSALM LXV. BEcause God is the onely hearer of prayer, & hath been reconcileed and pacifyed, concerning his flood and inundation, of iniquity and trespasses, as Psal. 32. which overcame him, that all prais and vowes are due to him in Zion: hee inviteeth all the world to set out the happines of that habitation, the Church, and of his Election, and the comfortable substance, that is had from thence for salvation, against the fearfull justice of condemnation; hee beeing the trust of all the world by his power, the Law: walking upon the seas, and haveing them under his feet, by his unknown steps, and sayling through the Law, Psal. 77.8.47. &c. setleing kingdoms, putting down the rageing and wicked nations, floodes of iniquity, and delighting them that fear him, with sending his word among them, the River of the Scriptures to water and enrich them, to make them fuitfull: Hee now prayeth God for the farther propagation of the Church under a form of husbandry. That as hee looketh out of the Scriptures upon the earth and it prospereth: so that hee would doo all good husbandry upon the ground, to make it fit for receiving the seed of the word, with mollyfying all hard and savage hartes and wayes of men: and sending showers of grace into them. Then, that hee will bless the begetting, and crown all the growth therof, with goodnes: that his wayes may make the word to flow plentifully in all ignorant countryes, called the wildernes, that they may bee as well sett, as the rest, and triumph as well as the rest together, Ps. 67. Construction. Samec, to uphold or sustein. The kindes of sustenance heer, is forgive∣nes of sinns, and satiety of grace out of the hous of God, the trust and susteiner of all the world. Whos indument of strength and might holdeth fast up the hills: and beateth down the seas &c. by this privation. The manner of susteining the erth, is by his dayly and plentifull watering of it: and provideing of Corn, as for the dwellers in it, and plantation. So that Husbundry mainteynes all, as Salomon saith. He, the other letter, signifying behold: is all for presence or absence, in sight or out of sight, or distant and overhealing, and that of divers kindes, as prayer and prays to God. By chuseing and entertaining neerest unto him, &c. Endes and longinquities &c. and make the farthest countryes meay Ps. 103. thou lookest &c. on the earth &c. That the erth may be covered with corne and cattell &c. that a man can not see the ground, reconcileing them, and covering of sinns. Love couereth a multitude of sinns: so the Mercey∣seat, and mans protection is sett over the Law. Because the Iustice therof is so terrible. Accordingly, Seh, both the letters of Nasah, to lift up, or take away, or pardon. Exodus. Ier. 31. and Ps. 50. Lev. 7. you are told what sacrifice hee heer meaneth: to wit, thanks-offering and vowes, for his gratious protection and susteining of him, by his mercyfull goodnes out of his word. Gods gentle audience, forgiveing of sinns, and pro∣videing for food and raiment, is a most mercy full thing, and well deserveth the prais and devotion of all the world; and therfor this audience and satisfaction was bidden proper in Zion, the place of Gods habitation. PSALM. LXVI. SEeing by fearfull and terrible meanes, and by mighty and strange workes, by the greatnes of his strength in this Law, God hath preserved his Church and sub∣dued his Enimyes: and increased his worship, trying his people by all manner of tentation & troubles: the vigilance of his word, called his eyes, tending them, and saveing them, to a place of refreshing: and with life and rejoiceing in their soules, that hee let not their feet bee mooved; and overthrew their Enimyes, lest they should vaunt over them: hee willeth all the erth and all nations, to prais their God, and to set out his glorious Name for the same, because hee himself is ready to pay his vowes in the hous of God, haveing obteined the request that hee made in his distress. Construction. Samec, to put upon, or hold up: by the term put so often used upon or under, exalt or putting upon, or lay upon, or ride upon &c. also by submitting pressing, straineing, and bowing down as well as advanceing, ruleing over, high invention,
&c. turning up-side-down by his terrible might, as the Sea into dry land &c. Van, a hook or crook: for prayer, for mercy in distress, which was heard and graunted. Sau, as from Savah, from whence is Masveh, a mask. The deepth of the sea shall be dis∣covered, and the dry land shall appeer Gen. 1. and be unmasked. So likewise for trying, and prooving &c. Exodus. Heer bee used all the termes of prays and glory of God, and the calling upon him, that can bee thought on: shouting, singing, chanting, hymning, Psalming, bles∣sing, &c. with the doubling of the termes, prays and glory, to shew of what sort the Sacri∣fice heer must bee: to wit, according to Ps. 50. praysing and glorifying of God, for de∣liverance: by way of exaltations, in likenes of burnt-offering & vowes, heer repeated. Not without fine allusion to the manner of offering: for all sacrifices must pass through fire and water, it must bee soundly tryed, and found as pure as silver (hee that findeth no wic∣kednes in himself shal be heard) it must be strayned. A man must justify it, and bless it by putting his hand upon the head of the sacrifice. And this is meant by rydeing over our heads &c. commanded. PSALM LXVII. HEer the whole Church prayeth for illumination in the Law of God, called his countenance: that it bee merry and gratious upon them; that they may bee a light to all the world, and all nations may confess him; for his justice, and upright Iudgement in guiding his people. And that their own God will bless their labours, that the earth and all the endes therof, bee replenished abundantly with the fear of God. Forgivenes is the way to life, Ps. 65. and faith in the promisses, and mer∣ceys of God, which are eternall. The Law cam by Moses, but grace and truthe, by Ie∣sus Christ. Heerby Christ extolled Moses, and setteth him out, and fully commen∣deth him, to fullfill all righteousnes of him. That by a way that the Iewes took no heed of, hee might bring foorth a celestiall governement, which hee calleth the kingdom of heaven and of God, Ps. 145. The Iewes were apt, in prosperity, to delight, and con∣tent themselves with a superficiall study of the Law, and therin to strain out a gnat and stumble at a straw, and bee much buissyed with trifles, as concerning the letter: but this depth, and bottom, and hid wisdom of the Law, as Ps. 51. they skip and runn clean over. They turminate and chew much upon the one, but swallow down the other whole. Re∣garding small things, but this Iudgement, and fidelity, and love and mercy of God; the weighty things of the Law, and way of Salvation: they wholely omitt, and call Christ a blasphemer for medling with them: delighting to hear, not at all, nor any whit regar∣ding the faith that commeth by hearing, nor the word of consciēce that is within them, nor obeying the doctrine of their own profession; but are offended with the restorer therof. Now this is the way, that David in this Psalme, would have all the world to know, by the perfection of the Church of God: which hee supposeth, should pur∣chase in all the world, and easily winn them all. And as the Law setteth all the world to school: that this way may abundantly increase the Church. Therfor the Church prayeth, that the bottom of this light of the Law: kindenes and faithfullnes, faith and love, judgement and mercey, wherby they are well led and rightely governed; may al∣so lighten the Gentils: that Canaan may serve, and Iaphet, and Sem, and all the world may bee of one religion, and protestation, and fear God with them. And that God will perswade Iapheth to dwell in the tents of Sem. Construction. Samec, to hold or bear up. Heer his countenance, which is his word, beareth up all things, as Heb. 1. The knowledge wherof, maketh a blessed and a sure estate. A right government maketh the earth prosperous and Joyfull. And the bles∣sing of God is all, which heerin, is peace, by the often repetion of the word. Another kinde, for Samec, is to lay hands upon the head, to bless or confirm, &c. Zain, to hear or conceive, is from the Hiphil, or coactive sens, a generall publication and prosperity of the word: in thes words: that all may know it, and confess it, as by the like repetition. Exodus is heer, the sacrifice of thanks and peace-offering, with joy and Triumph: by
the term and work of confession and celebration, and prais repeated. which is for all nations to hear and reverence. Ps. 50. also. Le. 7. Isa. 51. they pray for Gods bless∣ing, the word, for their peace, Psalm. 29. that all May sacrifice peace offering for abundance. PSALM LXVIII. BEcaus the virtue of the Ark is such, and of God, that rideth in the Deserts and in the Scriptures, which by his word in the church, is a provident faher for the fatherless, and a comfortable husband for the widow, and a good companion for solitary folk, and a Recreator of the restrained, Ps. 144.149. and a con∣demner of the rebellious; for which hee willeth all triumph: and becaus by his showers of sermons from Sinai, that shook the earth, and entred into all mens hartes, releeving with the blessing therof, and confirming them in their wearynes (38. yeers) by the Manna and Quailes, the heavenly food therof: and provideed for all the poor among them, by his word and an army of evangelicall Messengers: that the glory and beames therof dashed the countenances of Kinges, and put them to flight, that they be∣came a prey to women at home in their houses: and that they fell and lay slain on the hills like snow, for resisting the promiss and ordinance of God: not considering his invincible army of Angels, being millions of legions in the church of Sinai: and the infinite number of Spirits of salvation in the Law of God, Ps. 120. by which hee once captiveth all men, and ransometh som, and the rest for their rebellion abide in wrath: for this, his Mercy is above his Iustice, as the Mercy seat and the Cherubs, for reconciliation, and succour, are set over the Ark: for consideration of salvation a∣gainst all burden and oppression, Now as his Procession and Marching is all moste glorious and orderly, and all escapes of death are the Eternalls, with punishment of all his Enimyes and the heads of them, as Ps. 110. according to his Promiss: Now hee prayeth, the church may finde that strength from God, the Ark his strength, from his temple and Oracles which is promissed, and that which hee hath wrought for his people, that all kings may bring gifts to them, and his enimyes may melt away and flye like smoke: and that (as in a skant time of weapons in Israel) hee would drive & chastize all the Kingdomes and people great and small, the whole drove, by the terme of bulls, and calves, with a reed or quill, and scatter all that delight in warr, that Egypt and Cush may com in, and all Kingdomes of the earth, for the increas of the church, may sing to Gods Name, the Eternall, that rideeth, and is glorious, mounted in the Scriptures, the Ancient Heavens before them: that with a mighty voice in his church doe cry: give all strength to God for his surpassing defens and pride of Israel in the skyes, Psalm. 29.15. that is terrible in his sanctuary, and strengtheneth his people. Construction. Samec, to uphold or maintein: wherunto is opposeed kindes of perishing. Vpholding is by strength of it, hee makeeth divers kindes, and his virtues ther: God upholdeth as a father, a husband, a comfortable consort alone, a redeemer out of bandes, &c. And all in his church, by his word that susteined his people. And such was the strength and nourishment of them, even preaching. Gods army is of great and invincible strength, and able allwayes to save and recover out of the greatest deep of Misery. As is his preachng so is his order, of admirable strength and virtue, which is useed for tameing of the Nations. The perishing part is vanishing smoke, melting wax, snow, painting pride, flieing, scattering, &c. From Cheth, to prostrate, break and wound, and strewing &c. spreding like snow, &c. The two letters, Sach of Nasach, to overthrow, to be plucked up and destroyed. For the privative, like∣wise. Exodus. In the same sens, God is eternall and rideth perpetually in the word, wher hee is every wher so highly exalted and praised. And for this stately & everlasting resi∣dence hee is worthy. Apo. 4.5.7. to have all glory, honour and power, and strength &c. ascribeed to him. The sacrifice is of singing and rejoyceing and exalta∣tion
of the Name of God for the strength of his salvation, Is. 12.19. for the setting up of Israel. And the Name, Iah, for Lord, all for strength so oft, and Iehovah, for Elo∣him El and Adonah, to note the same. for a free will and heave offering, Exod, 35. by skipping and daunceing before the Ark. So liberally is hee mainteyned. The Name of God commeth 26. times, for the Honour of his Name, Iehovah, which letters signify so many just. So God hath the whole feld to him self heer, as Iob. 19. PASLM LXIX. COnsidering the multitude and reprochefullnes that dayly exercise themselves upon him, the miserable case that hee is in, reproche and greeff haveing bro∣keen his hart for continuance of his troubles, which are termed by all kinde of troublesom waers, that by no meanes, by spending of his voice and his eyes, with calling and looking for help, hee can get out off. And considering the want and distastefullnes, and strangenes of his freendes and acquaintance that hee was quite abashed: compareing his troubled minde, to the affliction of a prisoned man: and considering that this, that is com upon him, is all for his godlynes, and that all is for zeal to Gods hous and service, more then for his sinn, from them: now his prayer is, that it would pleas him, of all kindenes, to deliver him heerof. That it make not an end of him, but that God will leap in to him, and com neer to his soul, and re∣deem his life: that the rest of the church may not bee abashed at his perishing. And becaus of the trayterousnes and causlesnes of his Enimyes: that their own meat bee made a bait to catch them, and their table-talk, to insnare them; that they may lye tumbling, and burn in wrath, when they look in the book of God and see his angry countenance. And becaus they still persecute a man in misery, whom God himself hath strooken, and allready slain, for his foolish transgression; adding strokes unto strokes, wrongfully and beastly: so, that God would add iniquity to their iniquity still, and that they may doo more wrong and more, and never com to doo right: that they may bee cutt off by their own wayes, and never bee recorded with the Iust, nor mentioned in the book of life. That hee may sing a song of Thanks-giveing, a prin∣cipall sacrifice for his deliverance. That all the whole church may rejoyce in their hartes, that hee will once think upon the poor and imprisoned: and all Creatures may prais him for his care & advauncement of his church, and the inheritance of his seed for ever. Construction. Samec, to uphold. Hee dealeth heer by way of privation, in a contrary sens; His misery is so great that ther is no support, but hee is sunk over head and eares, and hee hath no good footing to stand upon, or any thing to bear him up, but is quite drowned and overwhelmed. The meanes of his pain, are faultes & folly, from his Enimyes: reproche & depravation for his godlynes, & skoffing at all his profession. Neither would his neerest freends know him, that much daunted and sunk him in his spirit. Hee prayeth for the favour of God and his truthe, to prop him, and suggest him therwith, by hearing and delivering of him. Hee looked for refuge and comforters, but they fayled, and wear eger and distastfull to him. That sunk him also. Therfor that all his Enimyes stay might fayl them. And Gods salvation may exalt and succour the oppressed and greeved, to the comfort of the godly and the just. Tet, for mire or durt, by sticking or sinking, and mire, for declining, wise repeated. as Ps. 9. Set, bothe ltters, Iehovah, inflected, Iehovih: declineed to shew the same. Exodus. The sacrifice heer is a prais of the Name and calling upon God in distress. Ps. 50. and a Thanks-offering, like the Magnificat of Mary, the mother of Iesus. Lu. 1. better then any declination or double way of the wicked. Hos. 5. And this shall hold up Ierusalem, and Ierusalem: the Saintes for ever. Heerto are these wordes to bee applyed. I will have mercy and not sacrifice. Math. 9. an upholder. And such a sa∣crifice hee will have in the wildernes also, Exod. &c. Remember still the iteration of termes. to confirm the doctrine. The request is, for Ignominy: Namelessnes and utter Extinction. Mark the declineing of Iehovah, into Iehovih the forme of Elohim, for the God of Hostes, and of Israel, at the beginning of the doctrine.
PSALM. LXX. THis Psalme, as it stādeth for a Cadence in the first book, in the end of the 40. after magnifyeing of the prais of God: so heer it serveth for a Cadence (together with the 71) of this book also, and of his prayers, and of the yeeres of his life, to in∣duce his prais 71. That considering now the fleetnes of his life, and that his life is now allmoste spēt: that hee would make great haste to deliver him, that hee might ere hee dye, see all his Enimyes confounded, Ps. 71. and that hee may bee able, even to the last, to set out his prais, and that hee may be found strong therin, when his Enimyes hold him forsaken of God: with request as followeth, 71. Construction. Gnajin, an eye: from the word Gnajin, 1. Sam. 18. to ey one, or invye one, as Saul did David, lyeing in wait for his life, and to hurt him. The contrary is to respect, help and deliver. That they may bee throughly daunted, and their current stopped, that seek to hurt, and delight in ill. And such most mery, and cheer themselves, that seek God, and love and look for his salvation: and therfor, hee prayeth for Gods speedy help and deliverance, as springs run merily that are not stopped. Another sens of Gnayn, or Gnen. The whole is terror, that stoppeth or turneth back: and cheer∣fullnes by deliverance, and help: and hurt. Marck the iteration, seek, hurt, help, hasten &c. tary, turn back, abashed &c. Exodus. The magnifying of, God, is heer a sacrifice of preaching him, opposed to the wickeds scoffing: in the words O sir &c. Which also is a service of him in the wilder∣nes, as they promissed in Aegypt. PSALM. LXXI. WHeras hee had been bred up all his life time, evē from his birth, in the fear of God, and a right service of him: and was cast wholely upon him from his mothers womb: and was dayly instructed, all his youth in the word: and made a perfect preacher and setter foorth of his righteousnes and salvation hitherto, as Psal. 40. which was his only comfort, and which often revived him, and took him up, when hee was buryed in deep distresses: and which greatly magnifyed him, and that now, his sowre and injurious wrangling Enimyes presume upon the weaknes of his yeeres, for advantage over him; and now seeing God had all the service of his youth, and because his whole relye is upon him: that hee would not now forsake him in his old age, but turn to him, and direct him, and rescue him from his Enimyes, by his strong rock, his word, which is his whole telye, and dayly buissines of commendation, that they may admire it. That hee may yet prais him farther and farther, for ever, for his singular Iustice. That his mighty arm of salvation might bee shewen by him, to the highest, to all generations to com; what evills hee hath rid him of, and how hee hath reviveed him, and put down his Enimyes, and clotheed them with shame and reproche of their own forming. That hee may sing of his truthe and faithfullnes upon the harp, with triumphing lips, and his very soul, sing for his redemption, and that his tong may never have don talking of his righteousnes, for confounding his Enimyes, for their proud presumption against him. Construction. Gnajin, or Gnen. An eye as before, from Gnajan. To eye for malice. The contrary hee followeth heer. Reckoning all the saving meanes, and the kindes of helps unto salvation. To wit, his relye & strong waiting, and trust in God, as his rock to dwell in. His hope and his praising of him all his life long. Another sens of gnain is heer, when it meaneth 70 the old age of a man, as Ps. 90. which maketh the repetition of the word, old age, &c. Another presence for assistance, by the doubling, of leaving and forsaking, and turning again and absence, &c. you must understand what occasions also the Enimy taketh for to seek his life, and meanes for it. Aleph, is to teach or be taught, by marking and wihstanding of him, &c. Which sheweth his singu∣lar education in the word of God, his preaching of righteousnes, another help & meanes
might and arme of salvation, Is. 46.49. to be exalted. Mark the repetition of the termes The manner of salvation, rescueing and saveing, is a resurection, raising of him out of troubles, and bringing to life again, which is his comforting of him, by the purity of the word, the holy Ghost, as Io. 14.15.16. In the verses, He, behold, & Gnain, an eye, Iehovah is declined to Iehovih, to note: and in Resh, the Chronicle of 490 yeers, also to bee eyed. It beeing an A B C. Psalme also, as Las. though obscure and close. In the seventh vers, you shall finde the two letters Zain, and Gnain, by addition in the term Gnoz, strength, which is that hee prayeth for, in his old age. But beeing multiply: they make the gratious time of rdemption after captivity or bondage, mark the termes reviveing, raising, comforting: and the three Queris and Ketibhes, of the same forme and sens, all together, to serve for both. Exodus. The sacrifice of Prais, and sermon and righteousnes, the fruit of the lips, as Hebr. 13. Hos. 14. Isa. 57. The sacrifice of righteousnes, Psal. 4. which is without leaven or fals doctrine or wrong dealing, of the Pharises and Saduces, Ma. 16. because they must not eat leaven in the passover, nor in any of their feastes or offring, Exod. 12. Lev. 2. For the tartnes and sowernes therof. His prayer is to God, his Rock, his Fortress and Rescuer; as Psal. 18.144. and all by righteousnes, the de∣finition of Iehovah, his Name. PSALM. LXXII. HAveing hitherto commended the heavenly Iustice, and profound judgement, and wisdom of the Law of God: and the whole way of God, Psal. 25. and the way to peace, Psal. 34.37.97. David now prayeth that God would be∣stow the same upon his sonn Salomon, that hee may fully reap peace therby, and that hee may govern so discreetly, that all the world may bee happy by him, and blessed in him. Though his own dayes were full of affliction, and spent in Sorrow: yet hee considereth, ther is fruit of Iustice, as Psal. 58. and that God would reward his travaile in the peace of his sonn, who is sayed, to have never a Satan, Enimye or Adversa∣ry in the world: so greatly hee prospered by the wisdom, that God gave him, at his re∣quest. And because many things belong to the wisdom of Salomon, and infinite blessings to com from his Iustice: David as a father, prayeth for his sonn; but the Scope, is more heavenly, for the Church. First, that according to his Name, his peace may never goe out or bee extinguished. That the Iust may grow and flowrish by him, and the Poor bee delivered from oppression, guile and injury, and his Enimyes layed flat along in the dust, as Psal. 59. That hee may deserve presents and gifts and tribute over all the world, and that all nations countryes and Kingdoms may serve him, and ad∣mire him, for his mercy to the Poor: and pray for him, and bless him. So that a litle poor feeld of corn, upon a barren hill top, beeing manureed with righteousnes, may bee as heavy in the head as the trees of the forest, & the Cittyes flowrish like grass, for the peace of the people, and growth of the Church. And thus hee concludeeth this book, and Exodus, and the way to peace and rest, and blesseth the moste heavenly God, and his moste glorious Name, for the onely dooer of great works and miracles, wherby hee so shineth, as Ps. 136. by lending him so bewtifull a light in his house, and of the Church against the end of his dayes. Construction. In the second vers, the two letters are doubled, to be thought upon, Gnain, an eye, or to eye, as before, is heer still to regard, or help: which is applyed to the Poor to save him from guile, and injury, and oppression, which hee is moste ubject to, The means righteousnes and equity, the instrument Salomon, the end peace, and then prosperity and beatitude, and then honour, and then glory. The clearnes of the estate that hee wisheth, is plainly intimated by the letters Gnajin, eyeing, by the sunn and moon, when it is a shineing estate, free from oppression, delivered and cleered from all cloudy∣nes, the sens of Gnab: both the letters together, for a cloud, or by metaphor, a dak floor
over head, as for Beth, that signifyeth a hous: this word is takeen for a beame, that is an appurtenance, that the armes of his hous and his fame and renown may reach over all the world. Mark all the severall repetitions Is. 60. Exodus. The peace of God is the blessing of God, and it passeth all understanding in the world. Therfor a Peace and thanks-offering is heer the Sacrifice ment. And it is by thes wordes. The Poor when hee shouteth &c. and in the last wordes of glory to the Name of God, and the calling on him, as Psal. 50. and according to the gospell, Glory bee to God on high; and on earth, peace and good likeing among men. &c. So as the glory of God consisteth in delivering and saveing of the poor: so is hee moste highly blessed, that is an instrument of his salvation. All which, you shall finde moste curiously woven and plotted in this Text. And thus is their sacrifice and service in the wildernes, made acceptable, and to som purpose in the spirit, before God: haveing particularly as∣scribeed al worthynes, and true worship unto God, that is due unto the lamb, Apoc. 4.5.7. to wit, all might, and riches, wisdom, thanks, and honour, strength and prais, and glo∣ry, for ever and ever. A sacrifice of all Nations, Is. 60. And this way is Salomons Name sett foorth, to continue for ever, because it signifyeth Peace.
THE THIRD BOOK. PSALM LXXIII. WHen the wicked doo all manner of wrong, and that they are even clotheed with continuance and custom in it: that they are proud with their worldly prosperity: and that they are so well fed that their eyes can not see; nor their hartes receive understanding: for their worldly pleasures which they lay unto them: highly disteigning the knowledge of God: and that they have all felicity, welth and peace, and are not plagued at all: to whom, hee thought, belonged all adversity, plague, and sorrow, even to their graves: and that ther should bee no peace to them: and that hee walked with a pure hart, with all inno∣cencey according to instruction, and yet is plagued and hath correction, every morn∣ing to his break-fast, and hath no peace in the world: hee feeleth a burning at hart, and pricking in the reines at this, and frets, that hee was almoste confounded with dispaire, for not knowing the reason heerof, which was hard unto him, till hee understood it by the word of God. Then hee calleth Gods people unto him, and promisseth them a sufficient exposition of it, which hee calleth the wringing out plenty of waters, even the Scriptures: shewing that all the standing of the wicked is in slip∣pery placees. They are subject to all traines, snares and intanglements, and are brought to a fearfull end, and utter consumption in a moment. And that their life is but like a dream, that a man doth marr with his wakeing. So vanish they as soon as they bee up, and God holdeth him fast by the right hand, beeing allwayes with him, that hee faile not, and makeeth his correction, his counsell to lead him, that hee may bring him to glory at the last. And for this, hee confesseth that God is good to the pure mindeed of Israel, and all leviticall men, and godly soules, by makeing them happy by the sight of him; of which hee prooves himself, for that hee hath neither kith nor kinn in all the world, nor any wight in heaven or earth, to delight in but him, and that God is graveen in his very hart, and is his portion for ever. And becaus hee seeth, that all that estrange themselves from God, and goe a whooring from him, following som other worship, God or vanity, in the world, against his commandements; doo perish and com to naught: hee liketh to bee neer God in his Ministry, evermore telling his messages, and relying in him for ever. which is his priestly devotion, Psal. 16.110. from the blessing of Levi, Deut. 33. for an Argument of the whole book of Leviticus. Construction. To be good unto &c. and to be brought to Glory, is intimateed by the first and last. The letter, Ghimel, to reward, & to be plagued & touched, for hurtfull, and quite destroyed & wasteed &c. is for the opposite. The pure harted: Math. 5. hee intendeth from the two letters together, Gnog, for a cake: the unleavened, and men of sincere mindes: equivocating the word Lebhabh, a hart, beeing also for Lebhabha, a cake. The contrary is of the wicked: of corrupt and counterfet cariage, and impure thoughtes. Gnajin, to envye or malice, is in the word freat or inflict, &c. as Ps. 37. like or dislike, or despise &c. his hart failed, hee allmost fell, to see their wayes succeed. His hart was levened, and akes, Ex. 12. &c. In vain hee cheered his hart. &c. O Lord thou marrest, thou despisest. &c. their image, becaus it is not like thee, &c. But becaus his hart is according to Gods hart: hee looks for the reward of the pure mindeed. Leviticus. Or in the Hebrew, Vajicra, hee called, or cryed, or preached, the first word of the booke: as the purity and cleanes of the charge of Gods word, require∣eth
not to think of any worldly generation, or to reckon of any beginning or end: as in that of Meschi zedek, Heb. 7. of Christ, Math. 12. Mark. 3. and from the blessing of Levi, De. 33. so heer his pureity is in playing the preacher, allwayes at Gods hand, to bee imployed in his Messages & his service. Is. 61.62. Which also toucheth the first and second commandement. Marke all the repetitions. PSALM LXXIV. WHen Prophets bee scant and knowledge vanisheth, it is no wonder yf the calamity bee miserable, and the Church of God, even his own plantation: the soles of his feet, bee now in the snare and caught. As at Nebuchadnezars rifeling of the Temple, and burning of the citty and Synagogues of Ierusalem: and for not takeing heed to their signes, and the coun∣sell of God, that they feel his wrath and suffer all reproche, Ps. 71.89. without knowing any end therof. Yet because his inheritance is of so great antiquity, and that hee bought his assembly so long agoe: and hath fed them so long, and hath saveed them by so many and sundry deliverances: and so oft and so miraculously, vanquished their Enimyes, and released them: and that hee was Lord and creator of all the boundes and limitations of the earth: the people of God now prayeth, that hee will shew som end of this desolation, as Ps. 14.53. and limit their unspakable misery and distress, and strech out his hand and save them. And that hee would not give away his Church wholely, and the soules of his innocent dooves, to the beastly kingdoms of the heathen, and never more to think upon it: but that hee would look to his covenant, and pluck their feet out of the snare, and defend them from the injury of the darknes of the heathen, and maintein his own quarell: that the Enimy that revile him, grow not too proud, and the poor praisers of his name, goe away with reproche for ever. Construction. Gnaín, an eye or to ey, or look directly upon. To remember, is a kinde of looking upon. And it commeth oft, so look or behold, &c. The contrary is to turn away angry, and forget, and regard not, all doubled words. Daleth, the day light and the Sunn, for the meanes of sight and pleasure of the eye: Gnen, for aspect, and for fountaines and rivers: Daleth, a door, for the doores and light of heaven, or the opening of the understanding, Mat. 3. If. 11. both the letters spell, Gnad, untill or unto: for the Termini, or reaching, from one thing to another, a quo ad quem, &c. And of this sort, is day and night, sommer and winter, &c. for seasons or signes, which shall never ceas. Gen. 1.9. The limitation is by 400, in the words, Ribhah, Ribheka, as Ps. 43.119. R. or 34.25. by the doubling of the word Tsorareka, thy besiegers, for 490, &c. Mark Chajath, in a contrary sens, and the wordes remember and forget, and signes, &c. repeated. How long, &c. Gned, eternity, by the oft repeating of Netsach, the continuation till when, &c. Gnadhab, to indue, for assembly, by all kindes and termes of the Church. Sheep of thy pasture, shaft or tribe or rod of inheritance, the hill of Sion, holynes, Synagogue, Sanctu∣ary, Tabernacle, congregation, &c. The indument and habit of the Church, is the prays∣ing of the name of God: and the roring and blasphemy of the Enimy, the contrary. For privation, which is the summ. And again, Gnad, for spoil, for the doubling of the out∣rage of the Enimy, in their ransacking of it. Salvation were the walles, and the gates are prais, now turned all to havok and reproche. Leviticus. Ther is a new Citty, or a new civility, which is the word of God, whose walles are salvation, and her Gates are prais. Heerby, God hath shewed himself a sa∣veing King in the midst of all the world, by dividing it by his Ministry, which is his strength, and passing through, as through a sea, Exod. 14. Ezech. 47. And makeing it as cleer as glass, Apoc. 4. wher the heades of the Arc-enimyes are broken in peeces, and the great devouring fishes of the Sea, brought to land and devoured. Preachers break up the fountaines of the word, that rivers of doctrine flow: they discover the depth, & shew the bottom of mighty rivers. Mark the iteration of the words, the affecta∣tion and prosecution of them, and you shall plainly see the intendement. The Syna∣gogue and place of exercise, preaching and invocation destroyed.
PSALM LXXV. FOr the revelation of the mystryes of godlynes, and propinquitye of Gods word, called his Name, which is the inward and harty understanding therof, in person of the church. And becaus hee hath had time to attein to a perfit judgement therin, and to discern what mould every man is made of, and the frailty therof, and is cunning in his workes and wayes, and all his ends: and that all the people in the world bee but melting pillars of earth; and vainglorious and wicked men, that aim at highe preferment: hee assureeth them, that stand they never so stiff, and look they never so high, one way or another, or farr off: they add nothing to their stature, Ps. 83. but that it is God that knoweth their size, that advanceeth or abaseeth all men, according to their understanding. And becaus in the hand of the Eternall, are the Scriptures, called a vessel full of sparkling and seething wine, with the spirit therof, which hee draweth out, and propoundeth: and that the wicked drinck but the litterall dregs therof, as Ps. 11. and are of a muddy understanding: hee sheweth that hee will tell, and sing the same, in psalmes perpetually, to the God of Iacob. That hee may, by this doctrine, cutt off the loftynes and vain glory of the wicked; called his hornes, the image and power of oppression. Dan. 2.8. That the Iust may the better shine, and bee highly glorifyed. Construction. Gnajín, an eye: from Gnaian to set eyes or affections on, for high looks, and strange projects for preferment and glory; for seeking it east and west, and all the wilde world over. He, the second letter, to behold: Lo heer or ther, to thank or confess, thy name is nigh, they declare thy miracles, &c. I will tell to the God of Iacob, &c. to draw out, and wring out, &c. which is to bring hid things to light, or in presence, or to shew or vaunt, or to sweep them away, as by the two letters: from Jagnah, to sweep, Is. 28. for the contrary. And this kinde of sweeping, is the cutting off of the hornes and glory of the wicked, &c. hee exalteth, &c. the doubling of Hee, is a pointing, &c. Leviticus. The sermon is, that God and his word doth all, and that is ever pre∣sent, and neer, that hee doth measure us, and weigh us, and condemn us, putteth down, and setteth up. Da. 2. from Is. 28. Wher Iudgement is layed to the rule, and righteousnes to the balance, &c. By these wordes, I measure, &c. God is hee that udgeeth, &c. by resembling of the scales and balances, high and low, &c. Besides, hee hath his cup of condemnation, to sweep away the wicked, by preaching it unto them. The effect of all is discretion, and demonstration. That a true light of all, and not a vain or proud conceit, promoteeth. PSALM LXXVI. GOD is moste famous in Iudah and Israel, and especially-ly in Zion and Ierusa∣lem, wher hee dwelleth; for discomfiting the Kings of Canaan, called the devouring hills; utterly destroying them in his anger, for their Malice to the Church and the Promiss, as Ps. 2. rebukeing them and their forcees, with an eternall sleep, astonishment and stupidity, with his angry presence, and his Iudgement, proclaimed out of the Scriptures, called the heavens; when hee riseeth to save his poor people, the church, and to set them in quiet. Now seeing Gods anger, and malice so kindled in them, doth make him so famous, by so horrible destruction: hee prayeth to indue them with the rest of his choler, to make an end of his Enimyes. And will∣eth his church to pay their vowes to their God, and to keep promiss and covenant with him: and that they doo gratifye the Eternall for his terror, that so faythfull-ly, and so terriblely, confounded the spirit and wits of Kinges and Princees; cropping highe trees and Kingdoms, for them, to performe his Promiss, Gen. 12. &c. as Ps. 2. Whence this psalme is formed, which sheweth, that that psalme, together with the first, hath
his authority from the beginning of the booke, and is a Narration to the whole Pile, and is no later work. Construction. Gnajin an eye, or prospect, as the word of God hath out of Ierusa∣lem and Zion, and hee is admirable for his Name ther. A contrary property of the eye, is sleep: they slept their sleep, &c. Bothe chariot and hors were in a swef, &c. that he is more eminent, and more in sight, then any savage mountain or promontory whatsoever. Thou appeerest greater, &c. thou art very terrible, &c. even as a lion, Amos 3. Vau, the second letter, for a hook or crook, betokeneth feat. Their wea∣pons fell out of their handes, and they could not hold them for feare. Feare of the Iudgement of God pulleth them back. As a lion is terrible in his sight and voice: so is God terrible in rebuke and anger, & wrath, &c. and crosseth all projects, & stoppeth and perverteth the wayes of men. La. 3. By both the letters, Gnav, from Gnavah, to cross. or pervert or marr. Leviticus. The Scriptures and preaching of the word of God, make the handes of the wicked to shake, it dauntes their courage, and taketh down the stoutest, to save and help the poor in Zion. Hee is cheeffly honoured, where hee hath don most for his people: hee requireeth his ministers office with diligence, for this favour, in these wordes: yee that be about him, &c. to bee allwayes mindefull of his benefits, and with great devotion to serv him. The whole is fear and terror. Gods Name is a lion in Iudah. Gen. 49. Amo. 3. Apo. 5. PSALM. LXXVII. THinking upon the dayes of old, as Ps. 143. and the yeeres of the right hand of the moste highe, which is the time that Israel was burdened in distress, and in sore affliction, and was wonderfully and mightyly redeemed, and miracu∣lously saveed and delivered, as Ps. 114. by their cryeing and complaining unto God, their Saviour in their distress: Seeing now hee cryeth moste incessantly in his di∣stress, and will never leave calling, nor bee pacified, haveing been long therin without attendance, stretching out his unweeryed handes, with an uncomforted soule, crying himself out of breath, stareing with his eyes, and amased, Ps. 17. that hee knoweth not what to say, at the long suffering and tarying of the Eternall, his God: but wondereth at his highe displeasure, whether in his anger, hee hath forgotten his promiss, of Grace and loveing kindenes, or hath sealed and stopped up all his mercyes, with anger: so considering Gods mighty redemption of the church, when they cryed; by his walking on the waters and pathes in the seas: Psal. 8.65. hee wondereth hee is not heard. Construction. Gnajin, an eye, or sight. I sought, &c. by all meanes my hand was stretched out, &c. thy way, &c. 1. Sam. 1. heerto hee alludeeth, in things in sight, and things out of sight, the sight of the eye, myne eye-watches, &c. the waters, seas, &c. to remember and call to minde, sight of the minde, soul, hart, spirit, &c. for a kinde of seeing, turning away, and forgetting, and Meteors, &c. lightnings, &c. as Chroni∣cles, by the term world, generation, ever, never more. &c. Zain, to hear: by com∣pulsion, of a continuall voice, by all kinde of meanes, in a hiphil or coactive sens, by force of sound, as touching his prayer, and also the Elements. As the eares bee daugh∣ters of musicque: so his songs, and meditations and his talke and commemoration in the night, are to open his eares. Concerning both the letters, they signify 77. the limites of Iudgement, of condemnation, wrath and revenge; which is the boundes of Chronicles seven fold, and seventy fold vengeance. And that now Mercy was to bee looked for; after such an expiration. And the same letters spell, Gnaz, strength: for Gods unspeak∣able Acts, don by his Arm and right hand: his Ministry. mark the doubling of the generall and speciall. that is all kindes and propertyes whatsover. Leviticus. Thy way is in thy Sanctuary, &c. and thy way is in the Sea. and in the great waters of the Scriptures, &c. and becaus thy steps are hard to finde: it is to be preached by the Ministry, for conducting of the people, as it was by Moses and Aaron.
that mercy and truth bee all wayes set before them, which is the way of God, Ps. 25. And the fidelity of Gods promiss, and covenant by which his people live. In this Psalme the term Iehovah, is not used at all, but Adona, and El: to express power and domi∣nion, accordingly. So doo the Teachers becom Rulers: as the Levites had charge of the Ark and word of God, and the regularity therof, that mighty strength. PSALM LXXVIII. EPhraim by Idolatry started from the Church, and rebelled in Ieroboam, that Hosea sheweth, which is the parable of this Psalme: pointing out by this, all the stubbornes and perversnes of Israel, and faithfullnes of the Church: and their often temptations and revoltings. How they continually vexed and angered God: that at the last, notwithstanding all his compassion and reconciliation, hee de∣stroyed and cast them off in Shilo, as Ps. 132. and refuseed Ephraim, and chose Sion for to dwell at, and chose the tribe of Iudah for his inheritance, and out of it, his servant David to feed them, as Ps. 108. So seeing every transgression hath just recompense: Hee recounteth all from Aegypt to David, and willeth the Church to bee warned by the ex∣ample of Ephraim, who for shooting aside, and refuseing of God; was soon rejected by God: and this is the sum of all Hosea, and the doctrine of this parable. Construction. Gnajin, or Gnen, the letter for 70, as for an age, or generation, which is se∣venty yeers, by the term Dor, so often doubled. Gnaijn, or Gnen, the word: for an eye, or look: as for parables or ridles: which are to the eye: to look unto; or seeming truthes. And after the manner of truthes, when they bee revealed. Heerto belong great won∣ders, secrets, miracles and mystryes of the Scriptures. The Sea, the cloud, the fire of the Law, Deut. 33. The rock, and bread, and flesh, 1. Cor. 10. Ioh. 6. Math. 16. see: hee clave the sea, &c. hee clave the rocks: mark all the repetition of the words, rock &c. when hard and cloudy, dark and hid sayings are brought to light, and to a heavenly sense, as Gnen, for fountaine and rivers of doctrine broken up. So likewise, concern∣ing the plagues, hee sent ill generations, and ill kindes of men, and angry occasions, Ps. 105. for a destruction. Apo. 21.16. Chth, the other letter, for Fear; bringeth-in all the terrible things of God: fire and sword, and all plagues for tempting angring of him, for not keepeing his way: baptizeing with the holy Ghost, and with fire, Mat. 3. Marc. 1. Luc. 3. Ioh. 1. and firey judgement of the Law. And mercy also, faith and confidence, &c hope in the promiss, and dispaire. Hee smote the Enimyes of the Church for the Church, and the Church, for themselves and their own misbeleeff. Leviticus. David beeing now Pastor and leader of the people of God, maketh all, the opening of the Scriptures: the releeff and redemption of the Godly, & the plaguing and damning of unbeleevers. Which is the work of the preacher. His calling was from God, and hee gave himself to the service of him. God his own elect, Ps. 89. For inter∣pretation of parables and all hard things and figures, Iob. 33. Is. 43. Proverb. 1. Hab. 2. as good Rulers are bread and water to the people. Is. 3. PSALM. LXXIX. THe Church considering the miserable and hard estate that they are in: their siege, their desolation and captivity, as Psal. 74. And shewing all the abusees of the heathen, with a sore complaint against them; for entring Gods proper inherit∣ance, counfounding all service, and prophancing all the civility and statelynes of Ierusalem, contrary to his ordinances: and makeing havok of the blood of his moste deer and pretious servants, and carion of all their gratious personages: and bringing all their pretious lives into reproche with their neighbours; and thnking that they have felt enough of his wrath, considering their calling upon him, and dayly service of him: they now pray, that hee will turn his hand to the heathen, and destroy them that have thus consumeed the Church, and bee blasphemers of his Name: and that for he ancient glo∣ry of his Name, hee would not think upon their iniquityes any farther, but speedyly, to
let them see his mercey, and his reconciliation for their sinnes, for his Name sake. And the end is, that the Heathen may bee disappointed of their glory, & Gods just revenge of his servants may appeer in might: by hearing the prisoners groneing, and redeeming their captivity, and multiplyeing of their reproche, of him and his servantes, many fold into their own bosoms: even seven times seventy for the seventy yeeres captivity, 490 yeers, taught in A B C, of Psalme 25, by the letters Ts, r, r, to consume the oppressours and bring finall redemption, that Gods people may set foorth his prais for ever. Dan. 1.9. Construction. The letter Gnajin, for 70, implyeth the 70 yeers captivity of Babylon, that great reproche of the Church, which to be seven times multiplied, for judgement and vengeance upon the Enimyes, make 490 yeers. And Gods merceyes are according therunto, Ps. 119. R, Gnajin, the word, for an eye or sight, is for the appeerance and pre∣sence therof, for the glory of God, and his name sake. The two letters, Gnat, from Gnit, or Gnatah, to cover or object: as love covereth sinnes, by reconciliation, and the grave, bodyes, which be kindes of covering, as reproches are for opprobrious, & igno∣minious, and abominable Objects. Leviticus. God is Pastor and shepheard, Psal. 15.80. Ioh. 10. when his Ministry is stain, and his Church defiled, & his lerned inheritance layed waste, and all their preach∣ing and teaching becom a laughing stock: &c. His people and sheep pray for his mercey, and redemption, to glorify himself in the salvation of them, by his mighty Arme, in this time of desolation, that they may prais him. Because all vengeance and mercy is Gods. PSALM LXXX. IN the marching of Israel towards Canaan, and their camping, the whole host was divideed (in warlike manner) into fower squadrons, three tribes to every squadron: three before, eastward, and three upon either side, and three behinde: this three was Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasse. Within thes squadrous, was left large room, for petty squadrons, of Priests and Levites, ordered in like manner: haveing their sever∣all chargees, and several offices about the Tabernacle, which they garded accordingly. Now within the tabernacle, was the Ark, and upon it, the mercy seat, and over it, the Cherub wings; the figure of their protector: in the Ark was the Law, and in it the strength of Israel, which for the justice, beeing the Godhead and protection of Israel: hee prayeth to the God of warr, for the shineing out, and for the rouseing the strong defense therof, to save them, in their lamentable Misery and desolation, as hee now walked before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasses. That notwithstanding, now the whole Church lyeth waste, and the hedgees of the Law are broken, and they are a mockery to their Enimyes: the transplanted vine of Ioseph, troden under foot and de∣voured, by the swineish and beastly Hethen, as Psal. 74. and 79. and left accursed: and Ephraim the sonn of his right hand, is scorched with this chideing countenance, for transgression; yet because of his blessing of them, with his right hand, they pray God that the shining of God and of the Law may guide him. That from heaven, hee would look out som mercy upon the work of his own handes, revive them and raise them again, out of their thralldom and captivity, hee beeing the sonn of his right hand, & confirm them, root them well and save them. That they may not turn back from him, as Ps. 14.53. but seek him and call upon him, to save them, haveing been long as dead men in the true service of him. Construction. The letter Pe, is 80. The word Pe, signifyeth a mouth: and heer to, hee bringeth eating and feeding, Kal, and Hiphil, active and coactive. The swine devoure, &c. God is sheephard and feeder. Hee feedeth with weeping and teares &c. hee prayeth to bee fed, with the cleer light of the Law, called his countenance, for a kinde of feeding to salvation, and to be turned and wended by the word, like sheep. Conduct us, and guide us &c. mark the repetition. To quicken, by calling upon him. These bee the two meates, adversity, and salvation, &c. Leviticus. That hee would look upon the Church, the vine. God is heer sheep
heard, Pastor and feeder, and conducter of them, &c. by the fire light of the Law of the Church, beeing scorched with his smokeing wrath: Gods firy and Angry look, & strife and scoffing & chideing countenance, and fumeing against their prayer, which bur∣neth or eateth, Is. 33. For the fire and cloud and lightning: hee is prayed to shine out by clearnes of truthe and mercy, and look upon it and save it, because his right hand, the Ministry, in Ioseph and Ephraim, Gen. 49 and the tribe whom hee had tyed to his ser∣vice, hath planted it. And lay his hand upon the Ministry, and bless al the labourers in the Church. Mark the doubling of thes wordes, Sonn for the Church, Psal. 2. right hand, confirm, &c. vine &c. That they may be quickened by hearing, and riviveed, by calling upon the Name of God. That they may profit and goe forward, and not fall back from him. PSALM. LXXXI. THat they should lay no fault upon God, this Psalme concludeeth the justice of the desolation in all the former Psalmes. Every state hath proper ordinance of conservation, which failing, all the constitution soon commeth to ruine. The whole strength and stay was the Law of God, and his service, which when they failed to doo, & fell to strange service: God was no farther tyed by promiss nor covenant, to de∣fend them. Moste solemn Anthemes and Choralls, must perpetually bee sung, by the Church, to this strength, in their Passovers, and feastes of unleavened bread, and new moones, &c. for their sweet redemption from their sore burdens, and sower travail of affliction, in Aegypt: beeing delivered from a corrupt and slavish bondage, to a glorious liberty of the service of God. At their sore cry and request, hee released them, and sus∣teyned them, that they might onely serve him: which yf they had don, and kept them∣selves wholely to him, unspotted; and chaste, and undefileed with Idolatry: as hee an∣swered all their hard questions, and temptations, at meribah, and by thundring Sermons, opened the Scriptures in Sina: as Ps. 61.68. so whatsoever sweet thing they had asked farther; hee would had given them their mouthes and their bellyes full of satisfaction; as the destruction of all their Enimyes, plenty and perpetuity of their estate, and had fed them with milk and hony. But they would not hearken to his voice, nor bee ruleed by his word, and would none of him, but follow other Gods, what they thought good in their own hartes: therfor are they justly left off, and thus tormented, and let goe to destruction. This from the first and second commandement. Construction. Pe, a mouth: the mouth was fed and satisfied: when they cried in Aegypt, and God heard them, their lips for mouth. He will fill their mouth he will feed him deintily with doctrine, and give him all his longing. By sweet words, and cleer in∣terpretation, and sermons, and Iudgements, and sentences, sweeter then hony, Psal. 19. Aleph, to learne, or instruct, yf so bee they will heare and bee instructed, and not forsake their religion; but they would not hearken not bee instructed, but erred in their harts, Psal. 95. and that was destruction to them. A soft answer putteth away strife. Gods word contenteth the soul, as meat is for the belly. Thunder, and Meribah, and Voice, and Tower, and Rock, and release, & Victory, agree for answer and satisfaction. Mark the wordes repeated, strange God, &c. hear, hearken, walk, &c. Testimony, protest, all asking and fullfilling, & triumphing, and the work of the mouth. Leviticus. The lips of the Priests preserv knowledge: so prais is the fruit of the lips, open my mouth, &c. Ps. 51.71. This was an ordinance, and an Act and duty, for the Ministry, in the remembrance of their redemption and deliverance. Num. 10. See the divers writeing: of Ioseph, in the 80. And in this, Iehoseph, to shew, that Ioseph added much to the Church, as Act. 2. at the preaching of Peter. Mark the blessing of Ioseph, Gen. 49. Deut. 33. his strength and sweetnes, the stone of Israel and Rock of the Church. And sheepheard, and feeder, and teacher, and Nazarit, and separate, and consecrate of his bretheren, &c.
PSALM LXXXII. VNtill Iniquity bee com to the full, Estates com not to finall ruine: Iniquity commeth not to the full, till Iudgement bee lost, and knowledge and synce∣rity decayed; for heerby was the world made; and stedfastnes of all estates. This word was committed, unto the Angels, the Priests and ministers, to be preserved in their lips, and worn in and upon their harts; for the continuall succour and estate of Gods people: also to anoynt Kings and Iudges of the Earth, who for the Miistration heerof, from God, were termed Gods, and the Children and the sonns of God. Now seeing all justice is for the Poor, and all succour is ordeyned for them that bee comforttless and oppressed: aud seeing in the church, even in the presence of God that judgeth them; they favour the wicked ones, and by wrong Iudgement, leave the poor in their handes, and this for want of judgement and understanding, which shaketh all: that they take the Name of God in vain: wherfor they shall loos their Names, their placees, and their immortall state of knowledge, and fall from heaven, to the ordinary estate and end of humane Princees, and comun men; and all for Ignorance or Partiality. Hee at last appealeth and prayeth, that God himself will now arise, and doo the earth justice, and judge his inheritance in all Nations. and this ac∣cording to the third Commandement. Construction. Lev. 19. In petaroth, Quedoshim: that is holy, or holy ones, &c. Pro. 31. for Pe, a mouth, for the sentence of the Iudge, and cry of the poor: and as you may see by the harping upon the words, just, judge, God, deliver, poor, &c. for Iustice feedeth the poor by releving them. And wher just and right judgement faileth by ignorance: all houses, and buildings, foundations, and ground works shake, and ther is an earthquake and tottering of all instruction and edification. And that is according to the letter Beth, a hous. And all government shall fall to ground. Leviticus. Shall not the judge of all the world doo right? so hee appealeth, when the Church and Ministry are without knowledge, and unjust: for the iniquity of judge∣ment among the Gods and Ministers of the Church, for foolish and pervers judgement, to the moste upright God himself, that well knoweth, and rightly weighes all; and all from the first and last wordes. Gods is the Archbishop and cheeff Pastor and Prelat: to ondemne the leaders and Princees of the Levites, by the words cheeff, and Prin, answering one the other, Nitsabh, and Sar. PSALM LXXXIII. THey that bee born after the flesh, still persecute them that are born of the spirit. Because of the ill will of thes mixt and impure Nations, at Zion: and their par∣ticular and spitefull quarells against Ierusalem: as Edom and Amalek, for birth∣ight: the Ismaelites for bondage, and Moab and Ammon, and Amalek: For bastardize. whch allwayes grudgeing, or beeing grudgeed of them, or accurssed: with Phelistia, Tyre and Ashur, that joyned with them: they grow stout and presumptions of their great strength. They draw to counsell and onsult against Iehoshaphat and the Church of God, 2 Cro. 1.20. How to cutt off their Nation, with their noble and famous memo∣ry for ever. And make a league and combine themselves by covenant against God, and for the abolishing of his Name for ever, as Psal. 48. The Churches prayer now is, that God will not be silent or sit still at this. But because they keep not holy-day: that hee would bestirr himself, against them likewise. And handle them, as hee dealt with the Midianites, for the like attempt and presumption; and handle their Princees, and choise Men, as hee handled theirs. That they may flye like chaff before the winde, hee pur∣sueing them with flames, of Terror of his tempestuous wrath: and while men seek the Name of the Eternall, it may scorch their faces, & turne them about again, like a whirl∣winde. That for their noyse & highe looks, as Ps. 75. it may still them & abase them, onfound them, and destroy them for ever. Psal. 48. 2. Cro. 20. To teach them, that
ther is no such soveraignty nor Majesty in all the world, as is the Eternall, and his name, the seeking of him, and calling on him. See likewise numbers, 22.23.24. wher these same Nations were kindled against it. Construction. Pe, a mouth. That hee bee not silent, the Enimyes rore &c, con∣sult and compact together, &c. That they be concealed or cut off &c. that ther bee no more mentiō made of them. The fire burneth, so the wrath of God, is a kinde of burning and an eating or consumeing fire, and his terror, a scorching. Ghímel, for reward, or re∣compens, or revenge, by comparison or example: as to such and such, or so and so, put their Princes and elect, like such and such, &c. that sought the like. Both the letters are spelt Fag, from Fug: remiss, or slack. That Gods terror slackens the counsel and bent of the wicked, by abashing and confounding of them. As not to remitt, intermit, or pardon, as in the first wordes. Mark the words of silence, and utterance, the wordes of fire work, and all kinde of windes, and of terror, and confusion. And princes and Name &c. doubled. confuteing of adversaryes, by sermons on the Sabbath. Leviticus. Princes and sacred ones, the protected and Elect, for Pastors and sheep∣heards, as Mich. 5. By doubling of the wordes and kinds, and also the phrases and affixes &c. to bee noteed. The fire work and the windes, for the Angels and Ministry, and the seekers of the name of God, &c. as Psal. 104. Heb. 1.10. Exod. 3. For the firey and terrible judgement, pronounced and preached out of the word, Is. 66. for a confutation by the Anoynted and hidden ones, so God is judge. And for the Enimyes making, and takeing head, by crafty counsel behinde their backs, the terror of the word by the Mini∣sters, shall all-to-crush them with bashfullnes, & confound them, Gen. 3. How terrible a thing is it, when the word of God is right against us, and bloweth in our faces. Mark the doubling of the wordes, for reward. PSALM LXXXIV. THis Psalme groweth upon the occasion of the former. Seeing Iehoshaphat was delivered from that mischeevous plott, and invinceible strength of thes nations that besiegeed, by prayer & trust in God, when hee was past all hope of secure∣ity, by himself or his people, and in that distress that he knew not what to doo: & seeing together with their defense, God rained blessings of strength, and riches upon them, in Baca or brachah, of the vally of Iehosaphat, by Gods judgement, Ioel. 3. which confusion of language, is usuall as Num. 26. For Shephuphim, Shuphim, likewise for Sharbet, shebet, for Darmeshek, Dammeshek, &c. Hee first admireeth the person of God, for his warlikenes, secondly, the lovelynes of his dwellings, for the succour they yeeld to the distressed. And thirdly, the happynes of all that serve him, trust in him, and are present with him, for their defens from him. And for this, hee would so faigne bee like the birds, in and about the Temple, allwayes praising of him, shewing, that yf they well consider the face of the Church, called the Anoynted, now after deliverance: they shall see, that one dayes service in the hous of God, and his courtes, is more worth then a thousand, yea then all ones life, in the Tentes and conversation of the wicked: Seeing from hence is light and defense, from hence is glory and Grace, as Psal. 144. and from hence is all goodnes, to just and upright men. From, 2 Cro. 20. Construction. Pe, a mouth: it is construed heer according to the phrase, as mouth to mouth, for face to face, Num. 12. because of the presence of God in his Church and temple. Daleth, for a door, is heer meant by the hous of God, which is called, the gate of heaven, Gen. 28. and of God, Psal. 24.118. Both the letters make Pad, from Padah, to redeem. Mark the doubling of the termes: to hear, and to see, and appeer, &c. and prayer and fayth, and affection, for presence, from virtue to virtu, from one virtue to another, from one faculty to another by the word, till they becom ripe and perfect in faith, & have his wayes in their mindes, wherby they see God. Math. 5. Mark the double∣ing of house, &c. by all kindes: to signify Gods habitation, and the place of presence and
redemption. Mak the doubling of the warlike Eternall, &c. and God of warr, &c. for the warfare of the Ministers. The rareity of construction, in Elohim, so many times. The person, is God and the Church. The time is preaching and prayer. Leviticus. God is the Lord of the Ministry, and of the Levites: and of their exercise, Nu. 8. Hee raineth all strength and confience out of his word, hee is the redeemer and Lord of life, by his plenty of Doctrine and blessed showers, Ioel. 2. which is the hap∣pynes of the frequenters of the Church. Mark the repetition: mark the strengh and brightnes of the word, like the Sunn in his strength. For glory, hee is full of grace and favour, for a protector or shield of faith, Eph. 6. As Moses guide to rest, Exod. 33. and yeeldeth all good to his anoynted ones, by his presence, Exod. 33. Psal. 34. Mark the sound of the wordes: sunn, and shield, and grace, and glory. for such a sunn goeth not down, but shineeth more then a day. Ios. 10. Is. 38. Apoc. 22. PSALM LXXXV. IT is observed by the Church, that all their captivityes and distresses proceed from the wrath of God: for their heighth of iniquity, extreame offenses, perversnes and sinn against him. And that hee is wont to pardon all, and to bee reconcileed unto them, upon their turning again unto him, with confession, renewing of their mindes, and amendment. And that hee hath so good a likeing to his country, as still to bring them home again unto it, after som correction of them, and their sorrow to repentance, to prais him. Now considering the tediousnes of this last captivity, by Babel, that in a whole generation they felt no life in them, nor token of salvation, for the fiercenes of Gods anger upon them: their prayer is, that hee will now shew such kindenes unto them, as to give to all sortes of them, a more dureabl peace then before, and that his salvation, now bee not long withholden from them that fear him. And for the flowerishing & glory of their land: that fayth and love may procure such heavenly Iustice as may set them in the way of peace, that they never err again. Like the way of the Eternall, Psal. 25.34. with the doubling of the letter Resh, to the letter Tsade, in the words Ratsitha & Artsca, The first wordes, to make the number 490, &c. Construction. Pe, the letter, a mouth: by the doubling of the word, speak, and Pe, the word, for meeting or kissing, as mouth to mouth, or face to face: or neer or present, by the itteration of the termes, kindenes, and truthe, and righteousnes or Iustice, and peace &c.

For his presence. mark the doubling of the wordes, Salvation, Ps. 42. & coun∣try, and land. The Eternalls likeing, and goodnes to it. In the first and last wordes. Leviticus. The good will of him that dwelt in the bush, Deut. 33. is to his holy Land, Exod. 3. his presence, glory & bounty, Exod. 33. Ios. 5. and faith & love, and righ∣teousnes; and peace, and salvation, the rest of the Godly Armour, and holy weapons and weedes of the Ministry, Ps. 132. For mercy and remission, and salvation, in perill for sin, that they bee not consumed, with the flame of Gods wrath, when they look in the Law. Ministers of righteousnes shall goe before, and lead as Prophets, to direct his feet, Luc. 1. PSALM LXXXVI. THis Psalme is fitted to the former, by the very wordes of the 25. That the read∣er should not misse, but have an eye thither, to mark the starr of his redemption, and line of Gods Iustice and judgement, which is seven fold the misery that they inflict upon the just, and Gods vengeance and revenge upon the wicked, and his payment of them, to bring the Poor, their hopes of inheritance, and peace eternall, with all plenty and delight, with it: by an utter rooting out of the wicked for ever, as Ps. 37. And this is all for his kindenes and faith toward the Poor and distressed, which hee calleth his way, which also is his work, which together is wonderfull: that ther is
none the like nor any God like him. This way (with many just reasons to be heard) hee prayeth to bee taught, and his hart to bee sharpened, that hee may walk by the word of truth, in the fear of his name, to publish and glorify him for ever, for his great deliverance by it, as Ps. 88. That when many proud and terrible Tyrants, which set not God nor his Law before them, seek his life: that God in the Kingdom of his compassion and kinde∣nes, would pitty them, and bestow upon him his strength, which is his Law, and therby save the childe of the Church, called the sonn of his hand maid, and to shew som signe of this good unto him; that the highe and fearfull looking men, may bee abashed and abased, when they see, that God doth take his part, against them. Construction. Pe, a mouth: for calling, cryeing, voice and prayer, and name, and hear∣ing, heakening and considering &c. Relatives. Mark the doubling of these wordes, with requests and reasons, which also is, for Vau, th other letter, for a crook: a kinde of crooking or fetching by petition. Likewise, the two letters together make Po, heer, or hither, which is also toward. Which is the nature of pitty and kindenes also, wordes often repeated. By his mighty pulling of them out of hell, and pittes of distresses, and saveing them, Mark the doubling of these words. His perswasions and inducements. Hee is poor: hee is pittyfull: hee trusteth to him: hee calleth on him: hee setteth his minde on him, &c. God is wonderfull kinde, and a wonderfull doer, 2. Cor. 4. And saveth strangely, &c. to the great glory and prais of his Name and calling upon him, Ps. 50.91. and a shame to his foes, by a signe of prosperity. Leviticus. Hee is com from Pastors, Rulers and Kings, and Gods, and Angels, and hostes, Armyes & exercisers, or soldiers in the former Psalmes, now to Ministers, works, creatures and servantes of God, Psal. 134.103. Mark the often doubling of the word servant: and son &c. and the word Lord, the relative, to implye the same. Such as bee the Priests, dayly Callers upon God, as was Moses and Aaron, and Samuel, Psal. 99. and Ezra, &c. For Saver or Helper of the people. PSALM LXXXVII. THer is no such mother as the Church of God, nor any parentage like unto God his word: ther is no such Church as Ierusalem and Sion, from whence the word of God and the Law issueth: that the gates (the goeings in and out) of Sion, are better beloved with the everlasting, then all the dwellings or cittyes of Iacob, or the Church elswhere beside. For, when other cityes are mentioned, & that this man or that man was born in them: of Sion, it is sayed more, that this man was born in her, in that, which the most high built and established. And when hee writeeth up his people, hee will not leave out the place, of their birth, that were born there, because of the excellent springs of musique that are in it. And this commendeth the Childe of the Church, and expoundeth the sonn of the hand maide in the former Psalme; to shew the pretiousnes of the children of God, the deernes of his servantes blood, and the worthynes of their redemption. Construction. Pe, a mouth, by the ineffable fame of Ierusalem, the mouth and talk of all the world. By the words: unspeakeable, mention, be sayd, reckon, &c. for kindes of utterance; springes, singers and pipeers. For mouth musique.

Zain, for Zeh, this, for certainty, by the repetition of that termn and sens so oft. This man, hee and hee, or every one, and hee, &c. both the letters make Paz, for gold. The golden citty, new Ierusalem, Apoc. 21. also Paz, strength, Gen. 49. Leviticus. For the Church and Assembly, and deer hous of God, and his beloved Ministry, for the place of highest degree of honour and prais, called the gates of Sion.

PSALM. LXXXVIII. BEeing now in the Cadence and conclusion of this book, and service also, which is the proper place of praising and gloryfying of the name of God, that in this Psalme, by true cours, nothing els cn bee expected, but commendation and prais of the Everlasting; for his great works of love and kindenes towards them: Now by the languishing of the Church, and their oppression in long captivity, the Estate beeing altered, the Memory and glory of Ierusalem dyeing and decaying every day; seeing they now tell of their birthes in divers Nations and Cittyes, and at length the Ierusalemites grow few, as the Egyptian generation in the wildernes: and they are estrangeed, and their acquaintance obscureed, and their estate abhorred, and beecom abhominable, like dead men: now beeing thus dead in sorrowfull lives, buryed deeply in distresses, and covered with wrongfull oppression, shutt up from their freindes and acquaintance by remotenes, and terriblely amaseed by affliction, and Gods angry terror upon them; Now how can they confess him aright, as Psalm. 86.137. and shew his kindenes and faithfullnes among the Destroyers, and make his Miracles plain among them that understand nothing, or manifest his Iustice, wher it shall not bee remembred? For this hee prayeth aloud, in the night, as Psalm 134. And holdeth up his handes, and calleth dayly for salvation and redemption, with early shouting and praier for the same: to wit, their return to Ierusalem, to prais him; counting all placees els in the world, but an absolute state of death, whersoever they were captiveed. Construction. Pe, a mouth: mouth to mouth: or face to face: for manifest, as by prayer, and Oration to God. Affliction is the contrary, for obscureity; signified by the whole nature of the grave, and dead men. What theyr estate is, mark his presence in these words, before thee, praying, shouting and cryeing, and calling, confess, told, manifested, Gods wrath, remember. And a miserable estate is com∣pareed to a grave for all propertyes. So his life is full of all evills, none evill escapes him. Hee is at the mouth of the pitt, expireth. Hee is dead, slain, weak, out of minde, cutt off, in the deep, in the dark, in place of destruction, land of for∣getfullnes, out of his acquaintance, in abhomination, shut up for ever: In wrath, hee rejects, and hides his face. Hee doth no wonderfull and secret thing, his mer∣cey is not revealed. Cheth, fear, prostration, and breaches, amaseed, terrors, terrible passions, oppression, &c. Bothe the letters spelt, make Pach, a Governour, Duke or Prince, Neh. 5. according to Ie. 48. also, a snare, which for his adversity hee maketh death and the grave. as Ps. 18. Leviticus. Nehemiah, chap. 5. sheweth, by useing the like wordes of this Psalme, that hee is the Cryer and Governour, and cheeff Prelate heer meant, haveing the like occasion in the behalf of the church. PSALM. LXXXIX. THe faithfullnes and kindenes and justice and judgement of the Everlasting, by which the heaven and earth and all thrones are built and preserved; must bee for ever sung. And happy are the people that can delight and bee merry in the presence and light of the Everlasting, beeing exalted by him, Wher hee hath ordeined the sounding out of his Name. And that ther is none to bee compared either in heaven or earth to the Eternall; for his warlikenes, for might, or counsell, or terror; for beating down the proud Nations and scattering of his Enimyes. Now haveing exalted David, and covenanted with him, and sworn, that his Throne shalbe for ever, and his seed after him, and that hee would so strengthen him, that no enimyes should hurt or oppress him; and that hee would make him as deer as his Eldest sonn, and give him a supremacey above all the kinges of the Earth: and that hee would never take his kindenes from him, onely correct him with odds for transgression of

THE FOVVERTH BOOK. PSALM. XC. COmpareing the age of man with the age of the Church, they finde the ods to bee infinite; not a wakeing in the night, to a thousand yeers: which they call but a shower of a sleep, that they were in God before the creation, and hath lasted ever since without extinguishment. His servants bee brought to a few, and pounded to dust, but hee reviveeth them, with sonns and daughters: and when they flowerish moste, their youthfullnes in iniquity angreth God and consumes them. All the whole time of man upon earth, is but an angry time, and it is gon ere they think of it, his age is short & painfull, & soon com about, which beeing seventy, or eighty, at moste; remember∣eth still their state of captivity, and fain they would bee wise in reckoning of their yeers, as Ps. 25.79.89. &c. which is, rightly to apply one time to another; wherby con∣cludeing their calamity to bee neer at an end, & their captivity allmoste out: the Church now prayeth, that God will now with all speed, com again unto them, and comfort his srvants. And betime, give them their fill of his kindenes, and make them wise, and redeem them, that they may sing and bee merry, and keep sabbath all their lives. They love much to whom much is forgiven: so, that their heighth of joy might bee according to the sorenes of their affliction, and the dayes and yeeres of their happines and mirth, may infinitly exceed, for their dayes of evill. That they and their children, may see his moste inestimable works, and that, in his pleasantnes, God would make good the la∣bour, and long service of him. According to Moses his request, Ex. 32. Deut. 9. An Argument of the book of Numbers. For so many reckonings as are in it of times and seasons, which is the summ of all. Construction. Tsade, meat. The travail for wisdom serveth for meat, and comforteth; which Christ in the Gospell speaketh from hence, Luc. 2. Io. 4. To dwell eternally in God, in his power; and live and beleeve in him for Eternall life, is a kinde of food, Io. 6.14. Gods wrath and terror is an eating or consumeing fire, that wasteeth and diminisheth man, with affliction for sinn, by firy judgement, Ps. 78. Ier. 10. Apo. 8.9.10. Is. 9.24. And out of the dust, hee hath his conversion again, and is satisfyed with comfort & joy, Gods plesantnes to him, & his estimation of him, and blessing of all his works: For mercey and kindenes which hee feedeth on. Mark the relation of the partes, and repetition of the termes. Anger and terror and utter consumming, opposeed to kindenes, joy and prosperity. Which is closely imply∣ed in the beginning, by the first and last letters of A B C, Athbash, for the terme of the Alphabet, beginning the three first verses, and in the third vers, twise converted and urned backwards, and made Tashba, in thes words: thou bringest &c. and sayest, com again, &c. so the yeer, is a kinde of convesion or retun, sleep and refreshing, florish, cutt and wither, and all alteration: to shew the confusion, before the digesting of the word, by confounding Athbash, for the Alphabet. Numbers is called Bammidhbar, in the wildernes, that they remained in eternity, with God, in time of rudenes, Gen. 1. and have an everlasting dependance from him. The opposition is eternity, and temporality: without variablenes, and with change, as be∣tween God, and his creature, Is. 29.40. Ps. 102. also Bammidhbar, by the word, their faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word, &c. and thus they are made his sub∣jects, and hee, their Lord and God: by the termes of Adonah, and El. And such ef∣fect
hath the voice in the wildernes, for reformation &c. of a few out of manny, by way of affliction. See the doubling of thes wordes, of eternity, and of moment, all ages, &c. generation. Yeers, night, day, sleep, in wakeing, morning, evening, fresh, withered, cut, past, y, and haste, &c. bring, com again, return▪ For recreation: cheer and mirth, &c. God bringeth all to a wildernes, and again maketh a habitation of the same: so that habitation heer, supposeth a wildernes. PSALM XCI. THis Psalme by way of answer to the former, sheweth wherin the safety of the Church consisteth, their victory & also their rule of redemption, haveing their dwelling with God, and lodgeing and relyeing in the shadow of his wings, un∣der the book of God, the word of truth. They shall bee so defended and shielded therby, that no weapons nor snares nor ods, by night or day, at home nor abroad, can deae with them. His Ministry hath such charge of them, and with their doctrine so sound, that with their voluble tonges their flowrishing blades, and spiritu∣all swordes, they defend their lives, and keep and save them. They lead them right, & keep them out of harmes way, and explane their wayes, that they stumble not. That by their faith and confidence heerin, they may stop the mouthes of Lions, withstand all fiercenes, and vanguish all terror, and beware of the subdolty of the serpent, and escape the divillish crauling temptation of vipers; and overcom all wrangling and spitefull Eni∣myes, Ps. 41. With this consolation in counsell: because they know him, and honour him, and call on him, hee will graunt them their whole request in the former Psalme. Construction. Tsadeh, from Tsad and Tsadah, to hunt or fowle, or lye in wait for prey, La. 3.4. Ts, Ier. 16. Hee describeeth the chase of an Enimye, how it is, by day force, and by night craft. This hee termneth a terrible plague, the stroke of fear: and the smart of the arrow, that commeth from him, lighting on him. Another sens of Tsade, is Tsad, a side, wher as all fell beside him, and no kindes of stroke, nor scourge, nor plague could fll on him, &c. The second letter is Aleph, for a thousand, and also many thousandes, by declineing it. And Aleph, for study, or lerning, which is ment by the wordes im∣brace, and knowen, &c. also Tsadeh for food which is his study and instruction, which bringeth salvation and his fill of dayes and all benefit, and victory. Ther is no fear nor dnger in the word of God, nor fetching any one out of his hous, that is so full of in∣struction. Mark the repetition, bothe letters make Tse, except, or without, or goe out, or escape, as concerning the snares. Metsudah, a fortress, for the first letter, concerning the stroke. This thinkes upon Jah, for Iehovah, by the number of verses, by protection against the plague of corruption, in Havath. Mark the seven affixed Hows, or hims, at the end, for exception and onelynes, for the whole Name Iehovah. Numbers. The wildernes is heer supposed, by the sport, beeing savage, also by the dwellings, the spoile of privative of desolation. As you may see by insisting upon the wordes; dwelling, lodgeing, relyeing, truth, habitation, tabernacle, &c. The person is faith, the hous is the word of the moste Highe, and All-sufficient, for his moste safe protection. The Ministers are his Tutors, to keep him from all offence, and perill, and shame, in the world. From hence is all victory, their faith and love and dwel∣ling with God, and adviseing with his word and loveing of him, and his grace is sufficient, 2 Cor. 12. Because his trust is aloft, in Eljon, the Highe: hee concludeeth his salvation from all and victory over all. Mark the repetition, and relation to Eljon, and Shadda, the Highe, and the All-sufficient, evermore. PSALM XCII. MOste sweetly by the fowerth, doth this Psalm hang to the former two, for that Psalme hath all partes of the thee. Haveing obteined their request, and de∣liverance from evill dayes: they can not but bee merry, and sing the wayes and wokes of the Eternall, with solemn worship, evening & morning, to advance
his Name. Which they acknowledge to bee a benefit of high transscendence, and ex∣cellent consequence to them, and past the understanding of the beastly and froward kinde of men: which is, let the wicked, the Molesters of the Church, and the Eni∣myes of God, flowerish never so well; and look never so green: they note, they shall bee rooted out for ever, and perish, as Ps. 109. and bee soon dissevered one from an other, and all their combination frustratee; when God shall survive for ever, and hold up the horn and glory of his Church, with a fresh anoyntment. And they shall have a whispering intelligence out of the word (by examples) of all plottes and practises against them, and shall behold their Tormentors, as plain as in a glass. And they, the Iust, as Ps. 36. shall bee green and floweish in their age, bee in good likeing, that are planted in the hous of God, and grow as upright as Cedars, to shew the uprightenes of the Eternall, and their rock: that ther is no wrong in him. This from Eden, the garden and plantation of God: Gen. 2. for the Congregation. Construction. Tsadeh, for meat or food, and this is the Sabbath instruction, out of the word of God, the continuall praising and preaching therof, the Sabbath service, early and late, hee makeeth it meat and drink to think upon, and relate his creation, Psal. 1. of so deep a cogitation. Hee dealeth upon the effect, as far, of feeding; with fresh oyle I am all perfused, &c. Deut. 32. Ne. 9. Prov. 21. to wit, oiley, o fat. Again, they shall bee still farr and fresh, &c. that bee preachers of righteousnes. Beth, a hous, the second letter, for the plantation of his hous, and courts and congre∣gation. And bothe the letters make Tsab, or Tsaba, to play the minister, or to exercise the Ministry and leitourgy of the church, to tell out, &c. to declare &c: which is to feed. The food is Kindenes, and faythfullnes, and uprightnes, &c. also, a kinde of feeding is seen by a flourishing, and prospering, and freshnes and greenenes. Tsab, also of Iatsabh, to stand, or abide, Eljon, above, or surmounting, as between God and his Enimyes is heer plainly argued. Mark the repetition of the wordes, for the eternity of the godly life, and the vanity and frailty of the contrary. This for the same number of verses, must be considered, to think of Iah, for Iehovah, 15. in bothe. Mark the relation to Eljon. All alludes to Eljon, the Highe. Numbers. The wildernes heer is the sottish, rude, bruteish and froward kinde of people, and wrong dooers, and enimyes to the creation of Man, and all reformation of manners, which are against all culture and manureance of the church. Thes for their wickednes, in all their prime & flower are supplanted rooted out & perish. When Gods hous, and plantation, and colony of the just shall flowerish, with all manner of prospe∣rity, for ever. It is a good thing to be thankfull for our reformation, and to be disci∣plined unto eternall life. Mark the repetition of wordes, and also of kindes. PSALM XCIII. THis Psalme farther prooveth the benefit of the Sabbath service, which accor∣ding to Ps. 29. setteth out the strength and statelynes of the Ministry, that at this time and place, the word of God beareth swey; that amaseeth, judgeeth and confirmeth all the world; It is the pretious attire of the Eternall, imagined by the costly jewells, stones and softnes of rayment, which the priesthood ware. Wherfor to this psalme and the former, and the rest of the sabbath, belongeth the whole epistle to the Hebrewes, much of the revelation and Ezekiel, and a great part of Exodus, all buissines of the Tabernacle. The Eternall is the righteousnes of the word of God, and his Throne the Scriptures, boh ancient of dayes, from everlasting anti∣quity: the gaynes of habit, and ornament therof, is wisedom, and the cincture truthe, which is the whole strength and stay of the world: and this is the law of God, that hold∣eth all the world uprighte. The rivers, great waters, and the seas, all the degrees of the Heathen have lofty things to utter, but the word of God far passeth all. His Testi∣monyes and Law, his protestation, and covenant, bee moste firme things, and sure,
to leane unto, ther is no fault or dissembling in them, and that makeeth the holynes of his hous, for which, all the world have their affection and resort therunto, as long as the world lasteth. Construction. Tsade, for meat or food, which is heer the word of God, Deut. 8. Math. 4. intended by the iterateing of the termn, voice, as the moste high voice of the Cryer, in the wildernes, Math. 3. Mark. 1. Luc. 3. Io. 1. Is. 52.40. the preaching of the word, & the raigneing and prevailing of the righteousnes therof, what a wonderfull, and everlasting nourishment, the kingdom of God yeeldeth to the Godly, and appetite of the faythfull, after their creation and reformation? It yeeldeth food and rayment, Is. 59. Math. 6. Ps. 29. The word is indued with high excellencey, and with great might. And this is the strong angelicall food, Ps. 78. Io. 6. even fayth; the holy∣nes of his hous: mark all the repetition and relation, to the Sabbath. Ghimel, hath a contrary sens heerunto, as to wayne, and may not bee useed heer, but is useed in the next peece, wher Daleth is spareed, becaus it maketh the first letter, by spelling. Both the letters make Tsag, of Iatsag, to constitute, or place: For the place or constitution, church or assembly. Numbers. The paradise of God, Gen. 2.3. a place moste expetible and desirea∣ble, a Kingdom and Dominion raised out of rudenes, a requiteing and bearing down of the Nations, called the waters, by the waters of the Law, farr excelling, with all power and Glory, and sanctification everlasting, inclosed. PSALM XCIV. NOw when righteousnes reigneth, is a time for the Church to call for Iudge∣ment upon their oppressours. Seeeing God, that is the Iudge of the world, doth hear, and see, and understand all the workes of the proud and wicked heathen, and correcteth them, and bringeth them to knowledge, beyond and contrary to their imaginations: hee well knowing the vanity of mens thoughtes. Now seeing Iudgement is according to Iustice, and answereth to all upright mindes, after the Law: they are sure to doe well, and prosper at the last, notwithstanding their correction. Which beeing for the Law and for rest; dureeth, but while a pit of utter destruction is in makeing for the wicked: which as great bodyes moove slowly: so, their end beeing delayed, is surviveed by Iustice and patience at last. Hee that makeeth the senses is not sensless, but full of light, and full of Iudgement, and wholely just; and lighteneth all by his Law, and must needs require attendance of brutish and heathenish men. To turn him from the way of destruction, to the way of salvation: from the bad way, to the good way, from the way of death, to the way of life, by the Scriptures, and confirm him. And this likewise is a wonderfull benefit of the Sabbath. Now in the greatest distress that can com, by the Molesters of the church, that might even break a mans hart to think on: Ps. 115. when they see their feet are gone from under them, and they are about to despaire of life and safety: then the repetitions of Gods great workes and kindenesses doe releeve them, and set them up again, with this comfort within them: that no corrupt estate or government can indure or reigne check by jowl with him: or any Corregnum, of such, as plot and decree Mischeeff against the just and harmless. Therfor now the church prayeth for a cleer revenge, a due retri∣bution, and a treble reward upon their oppressours: and that their God, the Eternall, their trust and relye, would unweave their mischeeff, and unplot their devisees, and render their own sorrow upon them, and destroy them. Construction. Tsade, Food: which is the light and understanding of the word: the first of all creatures, Gen. 1. Io. 1. and it yeeldeth all contentment and satiety, help and succour. Heer in this peece, the brute and foolish are opposed to the lerned: and the vexers, wicked and ungodly: to the Godly and just, and quiet ones, answerable to the 92. (as it were the same) and the greevers ther, are Iudged heer. A great dore is
opened, &c. Daleth, an entrance or dore, for instruction. Mark the repetition destroy &c. workers of Greeff, &c. brute and foolish, &c. correction, teaching, omnipo∣tencey of the Eternall, in knowledge and power, to revenge: by paying every one ac∣cording to their works, as Iudges of the earth, Ps. 62. That the unquiet and disquieters may have no quiet, rest nor Sabbath at all, but end with greeff, and mischeeff of their own. And this according to the letter Ghimel, in the last peece, for reward, or right, or judgement, or revenge, as yf it were still the same psalme, observing the A B C for verses, with one over, to shew Ghimel, in the second vers. Numbers. The wildernes heer is the proud, the wicked, the disquieters, the brute∣ish, the foolish, insulters, the vaunters, the arrogant, oppressors, sleyers, murtherers, naughty and mischeevous ones, ill Rulers that hunt for the life of the just, and condem∣ners of innocents, &c. The word giveth rest from such, and safety and defens: but to such, is no peace, rest, nor Sabbath at all. Is. 54.48. Iude, &c. PSALM XCV. THer is no peace to the wicked: so ther is no rest but to them of understanding, and how great a benefit is it then to be brought unto it? In this psalme, it is by way of their behaviour, in the church and Sabbath service. They must be∣ginn with triumph to the Everlasting, their righteousnes, and accord to the rock of their salvation, the Scriptures, from whence they were digged and formed, with psalmes of thanks offering for deliverance for the greatnes of God, and his kingdom who hath in his handes all unaccessible places, by power of creation; putting off the shoos of fowl wayes, and unclean lives, for the holynes of the place, by the feet of the saintes. They must doo all manner of reverence to their makeer, their God, for their induement of Grace and Manners, for their Education, and foster∣ing them with his own hand, by his Law: and not with hard and stony hartes, full of strife and infidelity, and devilish temptation, to hear his word: but without any wrath or murmuring, as Ps. 4. with all contentment, to hearken to him and consider his work. That they bee not wicked and greeve God, and err still in their harts, igno∣rant of his wayes, notwithstanding their instructions, and bee depriveed of their rest. Ps. 81. Consider the great work of the third day, Gen. 1. Com. 4. wher it is to bee noteed, that the weightynes of the work, is still to bee admireed, for the necessity of rest; and for greater sanctification and blessing of the Sabbath, ever som part of the creation is recorded, and the Great Creator to be magnifyed, extolled and worshiped. Construction. Tsade, for meat or food: and that is the makeing and creating of us by the word. by the comming together of the words, made and formed, and feed∣ing, and handes, &c. And hee biddeth prepare gentle and soft harts for instruction, at the time of hearing the word, that the meat may doo them good, that they may beleeve and relent, and repent at the comming of the Kingdom. When they see the word to raigne, and rule, see their harts are mislead and hardned, and cannot repent, nor receive, the food at Meribah, and Massah, Exod. 16. He, behold, for the greatnes of the Creator, they must present themselves in songes, gratefullnes, in prayers of humble∣nes, with all reverence, for the deep serchings out of sight, and the steep hills, in sight: by the abounding and defect of He, in divers words, and rareity of construc∣tion. It is also apparent, by Hem, the demonstrative, they, comming twise to∣gether. Numbers. Ther is nothing but the word and the wildernes, Government and no Government, docible and tractable, and quiet people: and hard harted, and disquiet, and molesters, tempters and provokers. Which have no benefit of the word, and can∣not obtein the rest, of the Kingdom: but to the troublesom, is tribulation and an∣guish.
PSALM. XCVI. THe Everlasting, the God of righteousnes is greater, and more commendable, and far more reverend, then all the Gods of the Heathen, for makeing and con∣firming the heavens of his sanctuary, wherall worship, Majesty, strength and de∣cencey is taught before him, out of his word: wher hee raigneth and setleth all the world, as Ps. 29. so sure by his doctrine, that it can never bee mooved, or carryed away again by any winde. And this is likewise to bee reckoned, a great benefit of the Sabbath service, to all nations: and thought worthy of a new song of triumph, to his Name and the glory therof: His kingdom of righteousnes, as Ps. 4. and his miracu∣lous salvation heerby, to bee preached, and told every day among the Heathen. That all Nations, famylyes, of all the earth: may ascribe all glory and strength to his Name, and offer and bow unto him, with holy fear and trembling before him. That th Heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in it, may thunder out joy and gladnes, & all plants, feeld-herbs and trees of the wood, leap and triumph and keep Sabbath, for the Iustice, constancey and faythfullnes of their king, at his comming to judgement (now by his word) and secureity of their kingdom for evermore. Consider the second dayes work, Gen. 1. with the Commandement. Construction. Tsade, for meat or food: this is, joy in the kingdom of heaven: for the righteousnes, and peace, and salvation therof. For this hee sheweth all kinde of of rejoycieing, approoving therof, amendment of life and a welcom: singing, leaping, daunceing, vaunting of all creatures, and boasting and publishing therof: which is the meat offering, in his courtes, at Ierusalem, the joy of all the earth, for the raigning of righteousnes, and of the word. And so commeth the kingdom of heaven to bee meat and drink, by joy in the holy ghost, and a heavenly delight in the power and glory therof; the prevailing of the word in man, and the lustre of a godlye life. Mark the wordes, and the insisting theron. For Vav, a crook, or to take hold, hee dealeth by the contrary: to give and offer, and bow unto, and doo reverence, and worship and tremble, by the word, yeeld, &c. Take up presents, &c. Mark the ite∣ration. Tsav, of Tsivvah, both the letters, signify, commend, commaund or bequeath, or send, to the same purpose: for the comming of the kingdom, for which wee pray, Math. 6. As all kingdom is with power and strength and commande, Ps. 68. Numbers. The wildernes heer, is the wilde nations and marches of the Heathen. wher the word of God, and this Kingdom of a godly man is to bee preached, and published all abroad: to setle them in a sound doctrine, that they may never bee moved more. What a delight they have to entertain it, what a rejoyceing and a welcom is, at the comming of righteousnes, Is. 52. when the nations bee conquered by it, and the church increased? mark the doubling of the word Hethen, Nations, familyes, people, &c. what a God hee is in respect of their Idoles: that is so to bee commended? mark the charge, bless him, preach him, tell out his glory, &c. And this for true and righte Iudgement, the stay of the whole world. Mark the doubling again. PSALM. XCVII. THe kingdom of heaven, of righteousnes and of God, is not with outward observation, but hee reigneth in darknes, with a cloud about him, in a dark and obscure stile of speaking, that his Enimyes may not perceive him. For right judgement and understanding of the minde is his Throne, and the fire of the Law hee sets before him, that burns round about his foes. The flashes of his lightnings make all the earth afrayed, and the hartes of great kingdomes (the Moun∣tains of the world) to melt as wax at his presence, and to becom soft and yeeld unto him. And his Glory, beeing like the heavens; putteth down all idolatry and brag∣ging
worship, and saveth his gratious ones from the wicked, and to preserve their lives, by forsakeing of ill, by that subintellectuall light which is preached unto them. And for these benefits may the Ilandes rejoyce, and triumph, & keep holy Sabbath, for the peace that preserveth their trade: Mount Sion and Iudah, for his Iudgements and advauncement of their God aboue all: the Godly, for their preservation, and the just, for light and understanding. Construction. Tsade, for meat or food, which is the delight which they have in the Kingdom of God, and raigning of righteousnes, by preaching and instruction, of the Sabbath, that all the earth may bee glad of. And also for Gods excellent Iudgements, of Zion, Ps. 19. to rejoyce in. Another part of the kingdom of God, is his judge∣ment, and punishment, sevenfold upon his foes, when hee teacheth the Godly and his deer ones, how to save their lives: and this by fire work of his wrath out of the Law be∣fore him: according to the letter Zain, for sevenfold. Mark the doubling of both partes of the throne: the one part is of justice, and of light, and the other of darknes and of firey judgement. The buissines of rejoyceing is all over light to the righteous, and judgement upon the wicked that the earth tremble at. Mark all the repetitions, and relative speeches, for that. Numbers. The wildernes heer, is Gods Enimyes, opposed to his beloved and deer ones: and the Idolaters of the Nations, and Image-makeers, they are the cheeff that bee daunted and abashed at his Glory: inviteed to his worship, for his excelling of all Gods for judgements, beeing Lord of all the earth. Mark the relation, and repeti∣tion: between light and darknes, God and Idoles, rejoyceing, &c. And this for the glory of the kingdom. PSALM XCVIII. WOnderfull strange workes of salvation, hath the Everlasting wrought by the Dexterity of his holy ministry, and his righteousnes in the Law, called his right hand and holy Arm, even in the sight of the heathen: which hee fullfilled, in carrying them through the sea, and drawing them out of mighty waters, as Ps. 18. beeing kinde and faithfull to Israel: that all the world have taken notice of the salvation of their God. Therfor now, they are to sing a new song unto him. And that with all solemnity, and greatest triumph that can bee, before their king; with Iubeling, and chaunting, psalmes and sonets, with hart and musicall voice, with shrill soundes of trumpets, that the sea and all that is in it, the world and all the dwellers in it; rivers and hills and all creatures wher ever men goe: may thunder and sound out Echoes of Ioy and gladnes, and rejoyce and keep holy day before him: hee commeth to judge the earth, that judgeth all justly, divideing the word. Construction. Tsade, for meat or food. They are fed with the great joy of his salvation: by revelations and cleer interpretations of his mysteryes and hid things of the word, Act. 14. Ier. 15. At his comming and raigning with righteousnes, Eph. 3. and a cleer judgement within them. Wherto all the world ought to bee obedient. they are made wise unto salvation, and to judge right with in them selves. His food of mercy and truth they live by. Mark the repetition: salvation, wonderfull work: and reveled, made known, remembred and see: relatives. Mark the doubling of all the words: reacting his prais & joy. The two letters Tsach, cleer, or to cleer, Is. 66. by loudnes shrillnes, plainnes, &c. the letter Cheth, for fear, is spareed, becaus of the insisting upon rejoyceing: the contrary. Numbers. The wildernes is implyed by the Heathen, the endes of the earth, and the confuseed world and her inhabitants. that before the comming of the word unto them, were without God in the world, or any true judgement unto salvation, to delight in. Mark the repetition: word, judge, justly, &c. They must needs therfor, greatly rejoyce at the comming therof.
PSALM XCIX. HOw bewtifull are the feet of him that preacheth good tideings, and bringeth news of peace and salvation in his lips? Now Righteousnes raigneth in the Ministers, the Angels and Cherus; woe bee to the Gentiles and nations of the Heathen. And while God is so great in Zion, and so farr exalted above them: they were best to incline to his Kingdom and worship his Name, that is so great, so reverend, and so holy. For all the strength of a Kingdom is the loving of Iudgement, and prepareing of Right, which is the Law, as Psal. 111. And God hath made in Iacob, in that kingdom of priests: a Law both of judgement and justice, for the peace and salvation of his servants; which hee committed to Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, of his Priests, in a cloudy and dark stile, when they called upon him, that they should handle the same; and they observed it, and received the understanding of it, to preach it to all. The summ of all which hee answered them; was the two parts of the Law, defineing himself unto them, as Ps. 19. that the Law had reward and punish∣ment in it, and that hee was a God of forgivenes, and a God of revenge, for their works. Therfor that they should exalt greatly the throne of that kingdom of justice, of their God, and fall at his feet, at his footstool, Ierusalem, and becom his subjects, becaus hee is holy; and prostrate their selves in Zion, at his holy hill, for the holynes of the Law and the vtterance therof, the everlasting Kingdom of God and his Righ∣teousnes. Construction. Tsade, for food, for receiving of the word and preaching of it: Exod. 19.20. Iudgement, the strength of Government, and of a King, is heer for food, Micah. 5. This was Iacobs portion, and the majesty of Zion, Gods Testimonyes and prescripts, & answers out of the Law, in a secret stile. Heerwith is his ministry fed when they call, and all rule preserved, and kingdom established. Hee raigneth within the vaile, in the moste holy place, and feedeth with mercey and forgiuenes, from the mercy seat, and reuenge, a kinde of judgement from the Law. And this is his holynes. mark the word repeated and argued: Iudgement, answer, holy, strength, and confirming, cal∣ling, &c. Theth, to decline, or stoop, or bow, or prostrate, as from Cheth, the second letter in the other peece. They extoll him with all humility and reverence, for the same. Marke the doubling, of the words: Exalt, and prostrate, &c. and equalls: footstool, holy hill, &c. Numbers. The Nations, for want of Iudgement have no strength nor stay of go∣vernment, but are in commotion, & are declineing and tottering, all in peeces, kingdoms divideed against them selves: they cannot stand. The doctrine of Zion beeing so farr above theirs, is to bee admirably exalted and reverenced, and for the holynes of it, opposeed to the wildernes of their profanenes. PSALM C. WHat it is to tell out the loueing kindenes and faithfullnes of God, at morning and evening prayer, of the Sabbath, Ps. 92. and the wor∣thynes and benefit therof; is shewed cleerly in this psalme, to bee thankfullnes vnto him. For what better thing can be then it, by which God is best and onely gloryfied, Ps. 50. and man best pleased, seeing that the repeating of kindenes expresseth thanks? Then as kindenes is measureed by the benefits, and faith∣fullnes seen in all good turns: so, the greatest good turn, and greatest benefit, and the greatest kindenes deserveth the greatest thankes. Now, what greater goodnes could ther bee to the Church, then their Creation, and reforming of their heathenish manners, and the makeing of them by his Word and Law, wherby he became a father vnto them: begetting them out of all darknes, feare and distress, to a most glorious light, and bold∣nes, and salvation: to make them his own people, his holy people, and his onely in∣heritance;
his sheep, and flock, and congregation; and to bee their dayly sheephard and Pastor, as Ps. 23. giueing them their education and food, out of the Doctrine ther∣of? And what worship, thanks or blessing or prais or honour, can bee sufficient for so great a benefit? Therfore, for the goodnes of his everlasting kindenes and faithfulnes, it is required, that they neglect not, but come before him, and keep Sabbath in his ho∣ly place, and with all alacrity, all triumph, all glory and melody that can bee; that of all offerings, they remember to sacrifice thanks and praise in his courts, with all their for∣cees. And that they recompens worship, and blessing of his Name, the cheeffest ser∣vice for evermore: then which, nothing can bee sweeter in the nostrels of God. Construction. Quoph, of Jaquaph, to compass, beseege, or invade, Ios. 6. which hee expoundeth, by the word bo, to come vpon, or to, or invade, Is. 41. wherfore the word is twise vseed, that it may bee noteed. As also by the rest of the words, that intend the priests function that minister about him, in the congregation, on the Sabbath: as triumph, serue, and thank, and prais and bless, &c. the Eternall and his Name in his hous: for his loueing kindenes, that is alwayes round about them, and compassing them, Ps. 32. and imbraceing of them. Numbers. Hee imbraceed them with his grace in the wildernes, and with his loue and kindenes drew them to him, and built them vp with Faith in his Word, Is. 31. The Eternall is the God that made them, and owes them, and feeds them. What is heere intended, but the godhead of grace and mercy, in the Name Iehovah, Eternall, the way of God, Psal. 145.116 Deut. 4. Exod. 33. Distinguished by the repetition of the demonstratiue. Hee, hee, that, &c. And this his everlasting mercyes, and goodnes and truth of his word, his faith and loue haue compassed them, and wonn them out of rude∣nesse, and mended their manners. So the Makeer, Owner, and Pasture, is nothing but the way of God, which is, to lead & liue an eternall life: which neuer expireeth, as the Law that dyeth not while the kingdom standeth, which beeing a life for all, and for ever, and for rest, is called Eternall. PSALM CI. IN this Psalme, David makeeth God to teach his way, and to tell his minde to them that feare him, promissed, Psal. 25. which is, the Iudgement and the kindenes mentioned in the Psalmes heere before; which hee now makeeth a Psalme of: to wit, of Grace and of condemnation, which the word yeeldeth at the hearing ther∣of: beeing the Baptism of the holy Ghost and of fire, and the fann that purgeth the floor, and makeeth clean the corn from the chaff, and diuideeth the sheep from the Goats, the blessed from the cursed, and the Elect from the reprobate. Wher God teacheth in his Church the perfect way, that hee himselfe walketh in his hous: with an intyre hart, as Ps. 26. when they come vnto him, shewing whom he setteth out of sight, and who shall not cleane with him, whom hee hateeth, and whom hee will put away, whom hee will take no knowledge of, whom hee will utterly dissolue, and whom hee cannot abide. Whom his eyes are upon, to dwell with him, walk with him, and serve him; and who shall not dwell with him, nor tary in his sight. That by this divi∣sion: the Enimyes of God may bee soon cutt off and dissolved from the citty of God and his habitation. The knowledge wherof is also a wonderfull benefit. For by this description and separation, and excommunication of the wicked: the just may bee sa∣veed and the church increased. For how shall they bee saveed but by faith, and faith commeth by hearing and hearing by the word of God? Heerby they discern, whether they bee of God or no, and what way they goe or ought to walk. Construction. Quoph, of jaquaph, to compass or inviron: heer hee intimates the kinde∣nes, grace and favour of God, called his hous and citty, that entertaines none but the faithfull, and them that walke uprightly before him. Mark the words: within my hous, in my sight, mine eyes are upon, dwell, tary, &c. doubled. Also the word citty,
equall to it. According to the instruction of the word, intimated likewise by the letter Aleph, to instruct: as by the doubling of thes words: perfect way, instruct, &c. Both the letters make Qua, vomit, or to vomit, or purge. to which hee frameeth the repro∣bate, and the contrary church, and synagogue of Satan. Apo. 2.3. the hurtfull child∣ren, or belial, that are every way, in their harts, farr from God and his way, and his word, and therfor are not to dwell with him, Math. 7. Is. 29. Ier. 12. but to be cut off, and to bee spewed out, and not brooked. Ap. 3. Mark the doubling: of put away, &c. and dissolve, &c. and abide, &c. Numbers. The wildernes heer is the devillishnes of mankinde, for which hee is accursed and cast out, forsaken and left desolate, turners from instruction, froward harts, secret accuseers, proud, dissemblers, deceivers and lyers and workers of greeff. Which beeing banished the Church and hevenly citty of God: ther will remain nothing but salvation, strength and power, and the Kingdom of God therin. Ap. 12.21.22. For the manifold judgement of a wicked hart, that is allwayes compassing of ill wayes. 2. Cor. 5.6. Pro. 11.19. Na. 1.2. PSALM CII. IErusalem long waiting, for the expiration of their captivity, and return from Ba∣bel, beeing promissed to them by the Prophet, to bee within seventy yeers: now when the time approcheed, they beginn deeply to consider their misery, with a harty sadnes, like David, Ps. 31. and upon many considerations, to pray, that God will not fail, at the set time to deliver them, and have compassion on it: for his own glory; becaus hee built it, and hath his name called upon, in it: and for his servants glory in the service of him, and their love to the place: and for the glory of the place it self, beeing the joy of all the earth: and for their great paines of dureance, and an intolerable feeling that they have of their calamity, growing old and withering therin. They pray, and shout hard unto God, to bee heard quickly, becaus their age is almoste evapoured away, and their lives expired, their bones burning, and their harts wither∣ing in their bellyes for sorrow, they cannot eate their meat, and they sigh till all their fesh bee gon, and skinn and bone com together. They are wondred at like owles in the day, and like som lone or strange bird upon the hous, to all the rest; railed and charmed at, by their Enimyes, that bread and ashes in all one to them, for meat, and they have store of teares to their drink: for the terrible wrath which they feel in them, that hee hath cast them off. Now, for that their dayes goe downward, and their lives decline like an afternoon, & God and his remembrance remaineth still, before and after heaven and earth, that hee hath made with handes: they pray, that hee will have pitty upon Zion, and for his own prais in future generations, hear the Prayer of his people that is overthrowen, without disdeigne, and loos them home again, to prais him in Zion, Ps. 133. and serve him with other nations in Ierusalem; and that hee that beat down their strength, when they wear in the midle of their cours, haveing injoyed their Glory but a while, and hath such plenty of yeers and generations left: that hee would spare them som yeeres of their lives, to return with joy and delight in them, that they and their children may abide still before him, and never be stirred again. Construction. Quoph, to compass: to besch, for mercey, and kindenes, and favour, and grace: and compass, in misery: when the dayes be com about, Iob. 1. Mark the words: hear, and attend, time, and set time, dayes, yeers, &c. Mercy, com∣passion, regard, despise, &c. And the end is inlargement: the grace is upon Zion, for the special glory of it: that is, for the church and hous of God, in so great account in the world: according to Beth, the second letter, for a hous: and now so waste. The prayer is for the eternall memory of it, intended from Quabhabh to curs: in the Petaroth, Balak. Num. 22.23.24. Vseing the contrary sens: as praying in steed of Cusing: and for grace in steed of vengeance. Mark the repetitions, prayer and

Shee is all solitary, and strange, shee is waste, cast out, and ruined, her Enimyes have vowed her destruction, shee is in a consumption with greeff, and becom a very Anatomy in her destress. Mark the repetition, her dayes consume, &c. her dayes decline &c. shee is withered like an herb, &c. wildernes, an owl among the nations, &c: so their state is the wildernes. Ier. 12. They can not finde wher they are, they are so distracted with distress. And all for lack of Zion, and the word of God, that they pine away for. PSALM. CIII. THese two Psalmes shew the judgement and kindenes of Psalme. 101. How for their wickednes and hollownes, men are brought in distress, and banished from God: and for their humility and integrity, pittyed and reecived again: this beeing the graunt of the request in the former: wherby the blessing of the Name of God, Ps. 100. for benefits and kindenes, is still continued: Thus comming by paires; as Ps. 20.21.90.91. Request and reward: Prayer and Prais: misery and joy together. Now all correction is greevous for the time, though it bee profitable, and necessary for salvation at last; becaus the mighty gracees and favours of God, by it, are brought: and they must bee layed once at Gods feet, and trodden to dust, and pounded to powder, before rhey will bee reformed of their haughtynes, hollownes, and stubbornnes that hee indeeth in them. which now beeing considered; hee admi∣reeth much the kingdom of Gods patience, and the dureablenes of his mercyes toward his childeren; how hee healeth their greeff, and pardoneth their iniquityes, (awaiting their conversion, humility, repentance and amendment of them;) and recovereth them again out of the pit, to grace them with all good ornaments (haveing once stript them of all), attireing them anew, with all good gifts of the spirit, which may bee profitable to life. Now becaus all Gods correction hath been with favour and compassion, bee∣ing willing to bee reconcileed unto them, spareing their faults, and throwing their trespasses away, in his heauenly kingdom: hee willeth his soul that loveeth him, and all the propertyes and forcees that hee hath in him, and all that ever hee can doo, and all the Excercisers of the Ministry, that hear his voice and may doo his will, and com∣mandement, and all the rest of the Church, his works: to bless him, and thank his Name for all his benefits. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass. Heerupon hee handleth the infinit reach and work, Kingdom of Mercy and grace, and love and kindenes of God, the excellence therof to his observers, and all them of tender harts that fear transgres∣sion. His angels pitch round about such. Psal. 34. This is equalled in the words: and guardeth thee with kindenes and Mercey. See the repetition: kindenes, mercey, fear him, & Eternall, &c. For his kingdom and property of merccy, domination, domi∣nion, kingdom, &c. Ghimel, the second letter, to reward, or bee beneficiall unto; which is first in the word, good deeds, &c. Hee hath not don according, &c. but, &c. and then by returning of thanks, by the termn bless, so often repeated. And require∣ed of all degrees, of ministers, the kingdom and of the word and his will, as grace for Grace. Hee handleth here Gods lenity, Mercey and goodnes onely, according to the letters, and also the Name Iehovah and of his virtue. Exo. 33. Ro. 9. The Psalme hath just the A B C, number of verses, to shew that of som one letter hee treateth. which is Ghimel, for his great Goodnes to all sortes. Mark the repetition. Numbers. The wildernes is wher the word of God is not hard of, wherfor the preaching of the kingdom of it was in wilde countryes, such as was Iohn Baptists and Pauls, &c. To Nations rude and hard harted; which is heer intimated by the precisenes and great ability of the Ministry, the contrary: that can hear, and are able to doe his
word, his will and his Kingdom of forgivenes, their place is to thank him. Because mercy, kindenes, and charity raigneth in them. This is that which wee crave in the Lords prayer, Math. 6. See the repetition in commandements, word, voice, hear, &c. For untill the Kingdom bee com which is compassed with all heavenly, civility: Wee remain still in the wildernes; ungoverned, and unformed, barbarous and rude. PSALM CIV. THe everlasting righteousnes of the Law of God, the word, by which all things were made; and without it was made nothing that was made; and that giveth life and breath and all things, and that all have their living and their mooveing and their beeing in him: the everlasting father and creator of the Church, and Prince of peace, beeing heer describeed: for the utility and benefit heerof, the people must meeds continue his blessing of the everlasting in his soul, and thanks unto his God; his discipline beeing of this sort. First of his majesty and greatnes, then his apparell, then his habitation, then his goeing, and his sending, and his work, that the word of God is a comely, a reverend, a grave and a stately thing to behold, and for beehaviour and counsell, to listen to: It is arrayed all with light & glory, and manteled with the heavens of understanding, It dwelleth in the Scriptures, and rideeth in parables, out of sight, in a dark stile, above the cloudes. It is swift and speedy in operation, as the winde, and his message and Ministry so swift and so firey, that ther is no withstanding or disputing, hee so establisheth the earth in doctrine, that shall never bee mooved; the waters of the scrip∣tures are so deep about it that all the world is drowned in them: yet his thundering spirit, mooving upon them, by doctrine divideeth them, and discouvereth the deep and his se∣crets therof: and sending the rivers of his doctrine between the hills, among the villages, to instruct the brutish: wher the heavenly birds of men, may sing praises in the woods the books of the Bible; by the fruit of his creation, the hills are taught to bear fruit, to satisfy and content the earth, with grass for beasts, as Nabuchadnezar, that proud King, & outward man, with that base diet of uncapability, and hearbs & fruit, to make themselves all manner of sustenance, countenance and confidence and grace to his creature, the Church and inner man with all deintyes, Psal. 23.21. That they may bee contented, with the doctrine of the cedars, the Ministry, which God hath set in his Church: wher the queristers dwell, wher for loftynes of building and edification, the holy stork is safe: so is the Roe by the hills, and the cunny by the rocks: so that all salvation is by it. Hee putteth of his light at seasons, and layeth down his clothes of understanding, by setting waneing and eclipsing of the lightes; and makeeth darknes for the wicked to seek their pray, and wilde and savage brute men to walk in ignorance; that couch (as soon as it is light, and knowledge ariseeth) at hearing of the word: that the Church may travail safe, and have all the understanding, and injoy the light therof till the evening, all their lives. And what is ther in all the earth that the wisdom of God hath not wrought? His wis∣dom is in the broad sea, the Heathen and the deep is round about him, & ther is know∣ledge and understanding of all the creatures therin, and the sport of the devill among them: and of the ships upon it, the Arks, and the Churches saveed and transported by it. All which doo hope upon him, to receive instruction in their time; who dealeth unto them his doctrine; and they are well satisfyed and contented. Yf they want the word, or it bee restrained from them, they are dead, ther is no life in them, and consume to no∣thing but at his sending out of his spirit, the Law, his firey message: the face of the earth is clean changeed, and the Church renewed and repaired, and re-edifyed again And now, that the glory of God, the righteousnes of the Law, Psal. 19. may bee revealed by him, and God may rejoyce in him, his Minister and work of his word: and because his peech pleaseth him, who is so terrible: hee promiseeth to sing Psalmes unto him. And because God likeeth it; hee wil never have don, that the wicked may bee quite consume∣ed. And willeth his soul still to bless him. For benefits as before.

And that preaching, so farr resembleth the creation, by reforma∣tion out of dust, bread of the word for to comfort mans hart, &c. The end of all is the creating of man, and his renewing: which is not don but when God hath once been throughly angry with his people. And hath brought them to their wits end, that they bee even becom dust againe, with misery & affliction, trampling & upon of the wicked, quite to abolish wickednes and sinn, and make an end of iniquity, Dan. 9. and make all plain before them, so that by the reformation, the wildnernes is discerned. Heer Nun, is added to the plurall, for reformation of the word, according to the singular. For in∣creas of the Church and creation of strangeers, Psal. 146. PSALM CV. BEcause all creation were vain & not worthy prais without preservation, as Ps. 89. hee makeeth heer the Cadence of this book to continue, dureing bothe, to the end heerof: shewing in thes two Psalmes, and that following, all his mighty and strange works of his deliverance and saveing of them, and his kindenes to them, all along. Wherfor, as it is a good thing still to bee mindefull of gracees, as Ps. 92. So this Psalm is penned for a Psalme of thanks-giveing or grace after meat, for the Church to sing. Shewing their poor and hard beginning, for number, acquaintance and provision: their growing, increasing, fruitfullnes and strength in a strange country, against all conspi∣raceys. How Moses, with the light of the Law starved their Enimyes, by the cups of the wrath of God, which plagued their policy, bringing darknes upon their understand∣ing and befooling them, and steined all their learning. God sent Crawlers for pro∣motion in their Kings court, and sent a number of biteing rumors, and Enimyes, & in∣vasion in their coastes; with hail of oppression, that beat down all their doctrine and good things, and hee made their spoilers and their pollers of their common-welth to in∣creas, and destroy their Princees, Apoc. 16. Heerby Israel grew strong and wealthy, & terrible to their Enimyes, brought out by a cloud, and secret purpos of the Law, and lighted them in the night by the fire therof, their earnestnes of song and egenes of zeal among them, to guide them: and fed them with all deinty meates and musique, the doctrine of the promiss, which beeing performed in the highest degree, that they might keep and observ his Lawes. Now they beeing thus fed and delivered: hee wisheth the Church to worship him, and call upon his Name and prais him, and sing Psalmes unto him, and mention all his workes, and make merry with his Name, and inquire out his strength, and seek his face, and remember all his wonderfull works, and shew themselves by all meanes thankfull for them. Constuction.

The two letters Quoph, and He, make Quhah, or Quah, from Jaquah, to obey. Heerto hee alludeeth, by all strength, rule and commande, and obedience
and disobedience. Mark the repetition & cleernes, by the relation of kindes of contra∣ryes. And this agreeth to the first. For Ioseph is made ruler and Lord of all.

The Church is arrived according to the promiss and preserved. The Patriarchs and Prophets, by their message and the word, are the walles and circuit therof, Ap. 7.11. What went yee foorth into the wildernes to see, &c. Ther is nothing but strange and hard things, and wonders and monsters there, that is incredible to report. So ther is much mystery in the word and of Godlynes; and when the Church is not well informed, the word it self seemeth a desert, for the wonderfull hardnes of it: which the letter makeeth in this Psalme. But it is cleered by a heavenly revelation and spirituall interpretation, which is the seeking of his face by the mighty operation of the word: and brought to bee beleeved by the Church. And the rest for infidelity, is left a wildernes, Apoc. 12. Ier. 2. Mark the repetition: wonderfull works, excellent Acts, wonderfull miracles, signes and miracles, &c. and this in nations wher no culture, or manurance and right worship is.

SHewing the often sinning, transgression, and fall of the Church, and their murmur∣ing against God, and their often receiving again to favour and mercey, by God: & their often forgetting of his kindenes to them, and his often pardoning and for∣giveing them again: in Aegypt, at the Sea, in the wildernes, in Horeb, in their tents, at Meribah, in their warrs, in their offerings, at the request of Moses and Phineas, and of his own good will: often times delivering them out of their distresses, remembring his covenant; and also beeing comfortable to them, by hearing their own requests; and ac∣cording to his great kindenesses, takeing them to mercey before their captivers, wherby they beleeved his word and sung his prais: but for the goodnes of such everlasting favour, and the virtues of his kingdom, what wight is able sufficiently to set out, and worship and thank him worthyly? Now the Church haveing sinned in frowardnes like their fathers, and beeing in the like distress, in captivity, and scatered among the heathen: hee prayeth, that now at his request, hee would gather them again, and bring them home to worship his holy Name. And that God would let them see the kinde salvation of his people likewise, that hee may also behold the joy & wealth of his Choseen, and be∣com a glorious Actor of his prais and commendation with his inheritance also, and thank him for the same.

That for his dissembling and falshood and repugning without caus, wherby hee deceiveth, injures all, and mischeeffs: every thing may likewise deceive him, and inflict injury and mischeeff on him. That hee may have nothing in deed and in truthe that hee desireeth and would have; or keep any thing that hee hath, or injoy ought that hee delighteth in. But that all things may faile him, as Ps. 5.37. That hee may dye quickly and loos his office, & leave his childeren fatherless & his wife a widow, that his childeren may goe about, and beg and seek out of their desolate Cotes, and have none to have compassion or pitty upon them. That the deceiver may catch all that hee hath, and strangeers robb him of his labour.

Yf God bee on our side who can bee against us? yf God fight for us whom should wee fear? Therfor yf hee take our part, wee may sitt down and bee still. And yf the quarell bee his, what need wee stirr? God hath no quarell but for his Church, which heer is personed by David the defendour and head of the same. Which, because it is a flock of perfect and upright men, and are not many, but have many adversaryes: God will by their own consistance; of righteousnes, and peace the fruit therof, subdue their Enimyes, and bring their Enimy, the Devill and Satan underfoot; which shall fall by their own wrong and perish by their wicked wayes: for what can bee the fruit of wrong but destruction? By the flowerish∣ing rod of Iustice and judgement (the strength of the Law, and ten commandements, out of Sion) & ten stinged instrument of the Decalogue, Ps. 92.98. Hee shall subdue them, and rule among them: for their wrongfull resisting the promiss, and their right to Canaan. Which rod of governement, that divideeth waters, and bringeth doctrine out of hard rockes of Scripture: beeing once cast out of their handes, was turned to ser∣pent like Enimyes of God, as Ps. 92. But Moses was shewed by catching it by the taile, and the returning to a rod, that they should have the governement again: which should bee an iron rod and hard governement, as Ps. 2. to the Resisters. For his battail, hee will have none but Levites, and the first born, the flower and choise of the wombe and seed of woman, the best lerned in the Church. The right hand and dexterity of the Mini∣stry shall wound kings: his Enimyes and heades of them, as Ps. 68. when hee is angry: even the head of the Arch-enimy, the King of the land of Rabbah, of the Amonites: by un∣crowning him, and tortureing the bodyes of his people striveing with him. Hee drank of the river of doctrine, the discipline of the Law, Ps: 36. Thus by the Church, shall God bring Davids Enimyes under his feet, and hee shall conquer and hold up his head, as Ps. 92. and shall bee a Priest for ever, Is. 61. like Melchizedeq: not born of flesh and blood, nor of the will of man, Io. 1. but of the spirit of God, and to walk with God, without father and without mother, without beginning or end of the dayes of life, or any worldly respect. And hee shall sit at Gods right hand, Ps. 16. and continue in speciall favour and grace with God, for the Eternity of the Church. And this from the conquest of the Serpent, Gen. 3.

Mark how Shin is compassed with the next letters on both sides: Resh, and Tau, in the first and last wordes, to shew the allusion. Deuteronomy. The recitation is, God wil have it is own work, and the victory his, and that a wonderfull work and way of the Law and word of God: the rivers in the Law called the way, Ier. 31. conceived and born in Sion. And the Serpent by a Gospell preached, the river of wisdom out of Sion: Prov. 18. shall bee made to stoope, for a footstoole, and to lick the dust, Psal. 72. and heathen Kings subdued and Arch∣enimyes conquered, and the head of his Anointed shall bee exalted, that medleth not. So that with the armour of God and his hoste, and excercise only, the Serpents head is brokeen. And this is a great kindenes, Ps. 119. N. Ps. 68. And such were the soldiers of Christ, of another world, preachers and not fighters, Ioh. 18. tormentors of the divills, free men and voluntary, 1. Cor. 6. Ps. 119. N. Ps. 68. Spirituall men, against spirituall Adversaryes, Mat. 8. PSALM CXI. HEer hee passeth from the Instrument to the work, according to the order in Ps. 92. to shew us the miraculous effect of the Law, and covenant and promiss (which in his mercy and compassion, hee preached to his people) hee recor∣ded to feed them. And the mightynes of the work of God, by this Instru∣ment of his appeareth, by his conquest of the heathen, and recovery of their country again, out of so many strong handes and lions clawes: consisting in truthe, and certainty, and judgement, justice and mercy and the fear of God, wherin it excelled. Wherby it becommeth durable and credible; for at end of the 430, and after the fourth genera∣tion (intended in the vers Lamed, and again in Tau, hee sendeth for his Church out of Aegypt, by his covenant and his promiss, in the handes of Moses & Aaron: feeding them all that space, by faith in his promiss and covenant, which hee made last for ever unto them, and redeemed them. And because this Instrument, beeing vseed for all their de∣lightes and sportes, by his everlasting Iustice, worketh also great worship and honour & wisdom: which is begunn in the fear of God, their profession, and perfected by per∣forming the Law: as ps. 99. Hee willeth the same evermore to bee reverenceed, and hallowed. And because his works by this Instrument, are so many, so mighty, so great, so sweet and delightfull and searchable: hee willeth all the whole Church, in all meetings, to prais and worship God, as hee will doo the same himself, with all his hart. And this from the promiss, Gen. 15. for the spirits of the Law, and works of perfor∣mance, and possession of Canaan, for the Spirit and worship and reverence and fear of God, the profession that beginneth wisdom: and therfor together with the next psalme, is made by the Abce: also the 119. wher the performance of the Law, bringeth good understanding. To perform the commandements satisfyeth this Appitite and tempta∣tion, and the Kingdom of heaven hath all. Hee that is wise will undestand and observe thes things, Io. 14. Christ calleth himself the way the truthe and the life, which hee spake hebraically. This to bee translateed into our phrase is the true and liveing way or the true and very way of life. And this consisting so much of the grace of God, and so much of faith and truthe, that it is beyond all imagination; his work and his way

Mark the repetition prais, worship, fear, reverend, convenant: truthe, rememberance, works, gracious and mercifull for ever, for the eternity of the life, and work and way of God, and the comendation of it. His works are wonderfull: they are so delightfull, so reverend, so seemly, so just, so loveing and kinde and pittyfull, so mighty, so true, so judicious and discreet: and his word, so faithfull and so plain. PSALM. CXII. MErcifull and just men have more light then other men: That when for pitty they lend: that beeing good, they may provide their matters by Iudgement; because they remain still and are remembred for ever. And having their faith and confidence upon this sure foundation of the righteousnes of the Law; and their hart so established therin: that for any ill report of the spyes, and the promiss to Abraham; or ill or hard look of their enimyes: they fear not. They likewise bestow their goodes upon the poor, that heerin, their righteousnes also may last for ever, and that they may bee highly glorifyed therby. Wheras, in this, the wicked, for want of his desire, melteth, and gnasheth his teeth for envye to see it. Now, doth hap∣pines consist in abundance of riches? or shall wee take care to fullfill the lusts of it? or think yee that riches in godlynes? No, Godlynes is great riches, yf a man bee content, with that hee hath, and great reward and happines followeth the profession therof. Therfor, laying away this shadow, let us com to the light: the sens then is, that mens hartes by the fear of God shall bee storeed, and mightyly blessed with knowledge, and doctrine of the Law, and promisses, Psal 145. as also with great judgement to use it, as Ps. 40. and great alacrity to impart it, as Ps. 41. which is the riches of grace, and of God, and of the word of God, and the constant preaching therof, to those that want under∣standing, and are without the same. Which is the breaking and giveing to the poor; thus cooling the tongs of the thirsty. Through which the righteous are for ever blessed and their righteousnes remaineth for ever, Ps. 1. in despight of all malignity of the wic∣ked, and to the great horror and tormenting of them.

And hee shall have wonderfull and strange success, to his harts desire, when the way of the wicked shall melt. PSALM. CXIII. THis psalme hangeth to the last by receiving te word from aloft, from the Angels and Ministers, from heaven, beeing preached to the Poor, and di∣videed and distributeed to the simple and destitute of knowledge, and unlear∣ned; such as have need of understanding, and are in distress and misery. Like∣wise it prayeth by the prayer and confidence of Hannah, for a third heaven of under∣standing. Concerning the literall sens: hee sheweth fist, that ther is none so mercifull, or compassionate, nor to bee compareed for humility with God, that vouchsafeth from his glorious dwelling, to visit the base earth, and to redeem them that bee troden to dust by oppression, and as it were cast awayes, and such as are throwen to the dunghill, for things of nought, and of no valew: to make them valewable with the best, and pro∣mote them to the highest, and to quicken the dead and fruitless wombs, and to cheer the barren woman with a houffull of children, and to make the despiseed and upbraided woman, an honorable mother, and wipeing away all teares from the eyes. Now beecaus ther is such prosperity by calling upon God, and praying to him: hee praiseth him again, and again, and willeth his Ministers from morning to Everning, and for ever as long as the sunn shineeth: to prais and bless the Name of the Everlasting. So the excellent and moste soveraigne Name of God, beeing Scriptures, wherin hee is nameed, the whole word and Law of God, wherin hee is mentioned: and bee∣ing meditateed or preached, or meditateed and preached: is so repleat with Grace, and mercey and favour, and compassion from on highe, on the afflicted and low degree: that it giveth them all life and consolation and resurrection, and comfort in the spirit.

THer bee three things that cannot bee satisfyed, and the fowerth can never have enough: no more can the Law ever bee sufficiently glorifyed by sens, and enriched by interpretation, wherof ther is no end. This psalme sheweth by way of example, the effect of understanding the former. When Israel had obteined the blessing, and was redeemed from a base bondage and miserable slavery, to bee great Lordes and Conquerors in Canaan: and had Iudah for his Church, and all Iacob for his Lordship: how could they refrain to daunce and sing; to see the Gentiles and the Hethen flye, and Nations to turn their backs, and kingdomes and Dominions to quake at their comming, as Ps. 77. and presence of the God of Iacob, that turneth hard placees of scriptures into smooth and easy doctrine? for the hardnes of the letter, such was the commotion, and horrour of the Nations. But for the spirituall sens, it serveth for rejoyceing to the church, for depth of imagination and greatns of his workes, as Ps. 92. Also when the hard harts of savage men bee melt∣ed into water and tempered; that they becom docible and affable and tractable by hearing the word. And not continue as at Meribah, Ps. 95. full of provokeing: when all shadowes fly away and they continue with him; with whom ther is no shadowing or varying or turning: out of all horrour or fear or trouble or trembling, in the holsom doctrine and righteousnes of the Law, and cleer expositions and interpretation therof, by separating, and by putting away all confusion therby.

It is so terrible that no creature can abide it. Iacobs own presence is also wonderfull, which, of so few as 70. in fower hundred yeeres, grew to an army of six hundred thousand; beside the women and children and aged. It might fright the country wher they came, and make them horred, and their hair to stand upright; to behold them, &c. What is it that a great Commander cannot?

NOtwithstanding the rejoyceing of the Church for the recovering of Canaan, & injoyeing the blessing and promiss: yet in this Psalme they forget not to give all the glory therof to God and to his Name, as Psal. 29.44. for his wonderfull
works of kindenes and faithfullnes, as Ps. 92. For his helping and defending of them in all distresses: for remembring of them beeing in misery; and blessing of them with the inheritance promissed, Psal. 2. The cheeff strength and glory of the song, the makeer of heaven and earth, and owner of the highest heavens, and of all the senses, & disposeer of the earth, and dwelleth in heaven, and doth whatsoever hee pleaseth. That all the whole church, both Laity and clergey and all that fear him or Profess him, hee may bless all, litle and great, and much more abundantly: them and their childeren af∣ter them, in reproche of the heathen and their sensles Images, that can doo nothing, nor have their five wits or any witt about them. And therfor, becaus they that are worn out and are dead, and are buryed in their travail, can not prais him: they that bee alive resolve to bless him, and wish to prais him for ever. In which Psalme, is found the whole profession of godlines, of faith, and confession and thanks giveing, of Glory and prayer, and prais, &c. Spiritually, to the Law of God and righteousnes therof, and judgement therin, that hath every point of atteinment conteined in it, bee ascribeed this help and defence, remembrance and blessing, as Psal. 66. To the which therfor, and in which bee the glory, confidence and prais that hee wisheth: the imployment of the senses, which Imagees neither know nor doo: therfor all the senses, and wayes of blessing and prais, bee ascribeed therunto. Becaus for Idolatry, the Heathen are turned out of doores, and the Church for the fear of God, and reverence of his Law, are redeemed and made Heires: that they give all glory therunto, and put their trust in the righteousnes therof, and commend it. Becaus all the Senses are to bee implyed for judgement, and the whole wisedom of Man resteth in the Law: the Law is to bee glorifyed with all might. And becaus by wisedom blessings are ob∣teined: it self is to bee re-applyed in all afflictions, and to bee blessed for ever, from the creation of heaven and earth. Gen. 1. And this for the foolery of Idolatry that slayeth the Church with greeff, Psalm 42.44. With speaking against it, or de∣nieing it. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass or invireon, for the kindenes of God: that doth allwayes stand about the faithfull, and protecteth them, and helpeth them, and comforteth them that trust in him, Ps. 32.33. Quotou, they are yrksom, lothsom and tedious, as are the Images that ther is no use of. For ther is no light in us: but in the Law of God that is the makeer of heaven and earth. See the repetition, God thrise: for the opposeing of Imagees. God can doo all things, and they nothing. Eternall, for affection and preservation of the whole church. Trust, help and defense, &c. Prais, Iah, 15. by the works of Iehovah, and for the spirit therof that images have not. Ps. 135.149. Deuteronomy. The reciteing and Rehersall heer, is the generall blessing of God for his grace, and the wonderfull light of his truthe through faith. Mark the repetition Israel, Aaron, and all that fear God, bless. Eternall twise abridged, Jah, for Jehovah, heaven upon you, twise, &c. For multiplyeing of his grace for ever. And this serveth for an admiration of the wonderfull way of God. Imagees and dead men can say nothing, to it, it belongs to the liveing to register the Acts of the Eternall. That they may bee of blessed memory, and have a fruitfull posterity. Consider the infinite increas and fructifyeing in Egypt. Deut. 10. Num. 2. According to the Name of Ioseph, in phrase of adding, as Act. 2. And his blessing: Gen. 49. Deut. 33. As the like is in the next, of Iosuah in phrase of saveing. Dealing upon the story as it goes. PSALM CXVI. THis psalme is joined to the former: by shewing, why the Name of God should bee so glorifyed above all, as Ps. 92. And the effect of calling upon him: for at what time so ever hee calleth, in what distress so ever hee bee, and whatso∣ever
hee requesteth: it is readily graunted, and hee is heard and reveeled. When for misrable distress and greeff, the very pangs of death and the grave had fallen upon him, and had hold of him, as Psal. 18. that hee doubted of life, and hee was quite exhausted and spent, as David, Psal. 142. hee prayeth for life and hee was holpen: that is, the Everlasting, that is just and kinde in all things of his wayes, and works, and preserveth the simple ones by his word, as Ps. 19. saveed him. When hee was so spent with affliction and misery, that no promiss of life or salvation could possess him or comfort him: and all that was promissed was incredible unto him, and seemed unpossible: and yet for the deer respect of his saintes hee saved him: delivering him from death and pain and wandering, to walk before God and his Saintes in immorta∣lity. For this grace hee professeth the love of God, and willeth his minde and soule to bee content, and at quiet, and throughly satisfyed, and take rest: seeing God hath dealt so bountifully with him, as nothing more is to bee demanded, nor any thing can bee a sufficient reward, for his good turns, so doubled and trebled upon him. Ther∣for hee will take the Scriptures, the book of the Law, of the promiss, of the Cove∣nant, and all the doctrine called the book of salvation, and from thence throughout them all, wassail and call upon the Name of God: Ps. 119. Q. and sacrifice his de∣votion in Sermons of Thanks unto him, in presence of all his people, in witnes therof: and willeth him to bee praised. And as hee is his Minister and servant at his right hand, and sonn of his handmaid the Church: hee requesteth that hee may bee loosed, and at liberty to doo the same accordingly. Now seeing God calleth his sonn the Church out of Egypt, heer is likewise their invocation, the mercey of God upon them in re∣deeming them from sorrow, and bringing them home to Eden, their promissed rest of Canaan, the gift of the Nations, and their contentment and love and thankfullnes for the same, to the study and contemplation of the Law of God, for the love therof. For their continuall succour and satisfaction, safe conduit and comfort, by the righte∣ousnes and glory and pureity therof, as Ps. 19. recovering them, even from the chaines and thralldoom of ignorance, and pit of despaire, by his miraculous grace and recon∣ciliation to serve him: in all perfet knowledge and understanding in the Church and Paradise of God for ever, wherto they are also thankfull and devoteed above measure. And seeing all thes may well content: hee willeth his soul to turn to her rest, shewing how bountifull God hath dealt with him, and resolving to pay ample vowes for the same. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to invireon or compass, is heer dilateed by snares and torments, and bonds, and misery, strict affliction: and with releas, and deli∣verance, the opposit terms. Iod, a hand, for death, and hell, and bondes that appre∣hended him, and had hold of him. Vav, a crook, hath the same sens: but by way of saveing, redeemeing, and deliveringe, and pulling him out of the snares and grave of affliction, &c. Hee would fain bee loosed that hee might serv him, becaus hee is his servant. See the repetition. The three letters make Quaju, they vomited: hee deal∣eth on the contrary: which is his love and good digestion of the good turns and mer∣ceyes of God upon him. Which agree well with the godly by their deliverance when they call upon him. Ier. 25. in so much that they mean to make him recompense by the thankfull service of him. The Mercifull Eternall Jah, the Name of Iehovah is fif∣teen times repeated. Hee dealeth heer upon Ghimel, as in the 103. And Iah, and therfor ther want three verses of the A B C. Mark diligently the repetition and the kindes of instruments. Deuteronomy. Hee will call and speak and preach much of the Name of God, and celebrate and proclaim his wonderfull merceyes, by daily service, offering and sacri∣fice, for a recitation. For hee redeemed them from slaveish death of Egypt, and satisfyed them, and gave them rest by Iosua, by phrase of helping or saveing. Mark the words: Name, Call, beseech, death, liveing, bountifull, good turns, Eternall: for merceyfull, Gratious, invocation, servant, pay vowes, in the sight of his people, doubled: in the place of rest. Heb. 4. They make earnest heer, of their delusion of Pharoh by their excuse of departure. Ex. 4.5. &c.
PSALM CXVII. THis Psalme by grace in the last psalme, reaching to the kindenes and truthe, Psal. 115. for which Gods name is so laudable and glorious, and so to psal. 92. wher it is to bee chaunted out for it: and seeing it lighteth upon a seventh, and therfor to require a rest, as also for sanctification of the seventh yeer, after the forty from Aegypt, with a Sabath work of rest for the land, according to the 47. dayes rain before the entering the Ark, & also for the number of the subdueed nations beeing seven, which the loveing kindenes of God, and his faithfullnes overcame: and the strength of his everlasting truthe and his word, hath conquered for them, as psal. 18. and his gentlenes of doctrine hath excelled, and prevailed over them, and fitteth on them, ps. 29. the Church now, wher kindenes & truthe aboundeth, seven times a day, yea infinitely, doo wish the nations and the heathen to prais him, and commend him for his kindenes, with a book of commendations for it: for growing of the word of God and waters of the Law through them and among them: as the number of clean creatures for the pureitey of language, and preferment of a pure profession, ps. 19. becaus ther is so excellent reward of truth and kindenes, the way of Godlynes, psal. 25. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass, is heer the mercy of the Eternall whose property is salvation, for the compassing and saveing of them and pardoning of the Godly. Which is ment the compassing waters: by the nations and people & hea∣then, of one kinde, and the waters of kindenes and truth, another kinde. And the wordes: to abound or flow over, and asswage. Iod, the second letter from Iadah, to flow, and so from Hodah, to confess, heer for prais and commend: severall words of one sens, so that the sens is doubled, as Shabach, to allay the flood. And bothe agre with Iod, to confess or publish, preach or celebrate, for a note of repetition. Zain, the third letter is for the auditory: to hear. For hearing is supposed by great commendation & prais, and confession and often repetition. Deuteronomy. The Deuterosy and recitation heer, is the buissines of prais and commendations of the way of God, and the wonderfull abundance and riches of his grace upon them, Ps. 103. Rom. 5.6. Eph. 1.2. This hee would have the nations take notice of. How greatly his mercy and fidelity and waters of life exceeded over them. By the name Iehovah, which hath heer a new division: into How, and Iah, as in termination Eli-jahu, Ieshang-jahu, &c. also by inchoation: as in Ie-hosuang, Ie-hoseph, &c. for assistance. Achaz-jah Jeho-shaphat, Io-nadab, &c. For addition. PSALM CXVIII. HEe now propounds in this Psalme the Cup which he promissed, as Ps. 116. of the waters of life, freely to the Church, out of the Law, filled from, Psal. 92. with the benefit of the worship of God, and invocation of his Name: and the worthynes of his reward to God for all, even faith, through which, hee feareth not the threats nor looks of his Enimyes: which is more worth then any con∣fidence in man. Therfor, when hee is infinitely besett and afflicted and corrected: hee findes life and salvation in the word of God and calling upon his name, by works of strange success and kindenes from him, as the whole Church can witnes, whom hee willeth to worship God therfor. And all his testimony shall bee of his salvation which is true, and his oely note and song, perpetually of his strange deliverance, Ps. 143. This is the song of salvation that hee goeth into the Church to worship with, and his invo∣cation upon the Law, in the Psalm following: when the Church with great admira∣tion and joy doe entertain, salute and bless him; with a Hosanna, wishing all prosperity in the Church, for comming in the name of the everlasting God. And the better to
welcom him, and that God may the better accept of him, and shine unto them: they sacrifice to him, that hee may worship and extoll the Almighty his God. Hee now greets the Church with a Salve or Ave; hail or wassail, and cup of salvation, by entring the Ministry and becomming a Preacher of righteousnes, which was strange unto them. For because of the uncleannes of his hands, and impurity of his hart, as Psal. 15.24.51. rejoiceing at the mercyes of God in him: thy wish all blessing and prosperity of the same, as Ps. 15.2.4. with the like congratulation for the Church. And that they had fed upon the rest therof, in remembrance and token of their full and mighty redemption, and great salvation from God: so that the whole Church may confess the everla∣sting kindenes of God, and worship him. Because his throne is the right hand of God, as psal. 110. and the right hand of God is the Ministry, and that is the word of God, and that is judgement and Iustice, mercey and fidelity, as psal. 89. the conqueror truthe, the written word, that rideeth upon the white hors, and fighteth valiantly: from which oracle, all victory and succour proceedeth; and all battailes are the Lords and the disci∣pline his: hee now exalteth greatly the dexerousnes and prosperity therof. And prayeth for an open door of the righteousnes of the Law and knowledge of the word, that hee may enter into the service of him and extoll him, and finde the way to pleas him. That his testimony and song, and burden of his song bee nothing but the ever∣lasting kindenes and salvation of God, and the faithfull recording & testifying therof in presence of his saintes, as psal. 149. and with the help of them. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass or inviron. Heer are divers kindes of compassing: helping & afflicting: helping in thes wordes: kindenes (& that is continuall help and salvation) & grace to help, Heb. 4. Tit. 2. Eph. 1.2. It is of this sort: God is by him and present with him allwayes. The Eternall is with mee, &c. hee is the onely relye and trust and confidence: they compass him, &c. but by his invocation hee cir∣cumcised them, and cutt them off. Mark the doubling of the wordes, and kindes of compassing: nations, bees and circumcideing, &c. Iod, for a hand: by the right hand doubled, Jod, to confess, and publish: by worship. Cheth, to prostrate, to cast down, &c. Ier. 23. the three letters Quiach, of Quoach, to take or receive: are intended by the gates & entertainment, hearing and welcom in his name, and also by the term of rejection or re∣fuseing. Hee prayes God to bid him welcom, out of his word and the hous of God, Gen. 28. Mark the repetition: wee beseech thee give salvation: bid God save you, bid God prosper you: wee bless, &c. Deuteronomy. Gods everlasting kindenes in his word is an eternall liveing and food for human men: mighty matters and wonderfull are don by his name and his right hand, for which hee is to be worshiped. Therfor for his recitation heer, hee useeth the wordes: worship, declare, exalt, extoll, say, beseech, &c. sonet and loud voice, for the mightynes of his Acts of salvation. The term Almighty is doubled, and also the abre∣viation Iah, for Iehovah, and Iehovah, the Eternall, six and twenty times: according to the letters Iehovah, for the mightynes of his salvation and kindenes, Psal. 136. to shew the same: and how beneficiall God hath allwayes been to his people by his Name, Exo. 33. Mark the terms repeated. PSALM CXIX. THe door of righteousnes is a strait gate, and prayer is a narrow entrance, and the way of life is hard to finde, and principles are the surest keyes: therfor in this psalme, hee makeeth every letter a preacher, and keeper of the Law. Hee dealeth not onely by A, B, C, as in other psalmes, to ground them in the profession of Godlines: but by mood and method in all art, to instruct them to felicity, and to crown thm with eternall life: that is, the best understanding, the wel performing of the Law according to the true sens therof. So as every letter useeth to vary according to the work: this is eight fold, for the number of consequencees and workes of the Law. For now, hee
seeketh not the way of the Lord, as ps. 25. nor the fear of God, ps. 34. nor faith, psal. 37. nor the work of God, psal. 111. nor charitable riches, ps. 112. but the whole perfection and light of the Law, ps. 19. the stone that slew Goliah, psal. 9. and perfect way of God, the sunn and moon light of judgement, ps. 19.37. the flood that drowneth the Enimyes and destroying meteors, ps. 29. and bridle of humility 39. and redemption 49. the cloud 99. the curs of the serpent 109. by note and collection wher all the 22 letters doo shew their skill, in keeping the Law: that hee may drink a helth unto them, as ps. 116. and hee may bee throughly welcom for doctrine, as in the last psalme, haveing on the whole armour of salvation, against all sweet temptation, as of riches, prais and strength and fa∣vour. The second, third, fowerth and fifth verses, in Rsh, contein Chronicle: in their first wordes and first letters. For the severall states from the promist and time of per∣egrination in Egypt, and till they returned to Canaan again 430. for the time of the jud∣ges 480. For the time of the Kingdome, till the end of the captivity 477. from thence are the 490, Daniels weeks to Christ. which St. Math. hath by generations: fom Abraham to David: to the captivity: and then to Christ. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass, is moste proper the grace and love of God, & the truthe of the word, the way of eternal life, to guard him & save him. Iod, for continuall publication and confession therof. Teth, of Natah, to decline, as the keeping of the Law or swarving from it. Quit, for Quot, to greev or bee yrksom or lothe. Hee disputeth by the contrary: his exceeding love and delight that hee hath to the Law. Therfor that hee might be perfected. Deuteronomy. His recitation heer is of the grace and truthe of the word and of the wonderfull effects of it, propertyes and parts of the Law, which bee 8, according to Exo. 20. Com. 2. Hee prayeth for mercy infinite, for his infinit love and observation of the same. That hee may have life therby. The Abce is eight-fold: frameed to the eight termes of the Law: so that not one vers in all the Psalme doth fail of som one of the sayd remnes: and ever more in every vers one of them is doubled, to make you mark it. In He, the eighth letter himself, onely excepted. And these bee the words heer meant, by a kinde of Mishne, or duplication, by A B Ces, to eight. PSALM CXX. THese fifteen psalmes have not one word of the Law nor Elohim, the name of God for judgement once in them, wherby it appeereth, they argue tresspass and transgression: according to the title and the stile as for trespass offerings, & for grace and peace, and pardon and forgivenes wholely. Because hee dares not stand to the Law for his salvation, as ps. 130. The number agreeth with Iah, the eter∣nall for his grace and goodnes and continuall presence, Exod. 33. The Iewes affected a heavenly Kingdom, and the heathen them. This Psalme keepeth reckoning of the dayes of strife, Gen. 6. the degrees of excellence of the Law 15 cubits above all nations and Kingdoms of the world, by the baptism of the holy Ghost. The divill was a mur∣therer from the beginning: the serpent and Enimye of God and his Church, by lyeing and fals dissembling, which is his whole practise against the truthe, for which hee is ac∣cursed and condemned. as ps. 109. heerwith hee woundeth moste deeply with greeff, the hart of the Godly, that love the truth: that a Giants strength can not pierce so deep, with the sharpest arrow; and kindle-eth hotter wrath and more smarting strife, then can bee resembled by the hotest burning coles that can bee. This Enimye is Meshek and Ke∣dar, an ill neighbour of the Church, the country of Gog, of the sonnes of Iaphet, north∣ward, which yet could not like to bee of Sems religion, beeing sowen among them. For they were mighty, and desireed warr with the Church, and hateed the peace therof. For this, the Church is far from building tabernacles among them for their preachers glory. But for the coursnes of their neighbourhood and entertainment: thought them∣selves accursed to dwell with them, and the time too long they had spent among them, &
the time too long they had spent among them, and set their minde upon them. And becaus they know not what belongeth to this peace and prosperity of the Church, and are good for nothing but to offend it: and have nothing in them but this kinde of per∣secution, as they are scattered among them: the Church beeing in this woe and dstress, prayeth for deliverane from them. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to inviron, is heer to gird too streit, by the termn distress or affliction. Hee is besieged with spitefull and contentious neighbours. Thes 15. compass, by the figure Anadyplosis, duplication or repetition, according to Mishne torah. Of the suns goeing back, Is. 38. adding to the kings dayes, by life of the Law. Psal. 61. in repairing Hezekias, according to his Name. Caph, to bow or bend, transferred to th bow of the tongue that is sayd to shoot fal and deceiptfull words, Ier. 9. Ps. 64.58. like arrowes of wildfire, and inflammations unquenchable. Ia. 3. Mark the repetition: to be invironed and confineed, as to inhabit, sojourn or dwell: affliction peace, warr, deceiptfull tong, &c. Caph, a hand for the betakeing their handes to weapons. And arrowes are for handes, and also tongues. Psal. 35.64. Deuteronomy. This kinde hath nothing to doo with the Godly, no more then the divills with Christ. Math. 8. Mar. 5. Luc. 8. Not to talk grace or truth, or to medle with a godly way, or repeating of God his miraculous works, or confessing his kindnes, or preaching his truthe and eternall life: beeing Enimyes to peace. What shall it give, &c. What shall it add: &c. Which is heer for recitation. They can not doo God any service, beeing quite opposite. PSALM. CXXI. BY faith all men are made the sonnes of God, therfor stand fast in the faith, for by faith yee stand. This psalme is fitted to the former, to shew the succour & releeff for such distress. That against the fals-hood, ther is no such strength as uprightnes, and no such confidence as in a cleer conscience, and in right perfec∣tion, and no such preservation as that of the Creator him self. That whatsoever is well preserved and don, and wrought according to God, Io. 3. is likewise well saveed and easily defended and mainteined. And for this the Church hath their beleeff and faith in God the maker of heaven and earth, for their ready help in distresses, as Ps. 46.115. and for their continuall preservation. Seeing, that as a father hath pitty on his wn childe, and a mother succoureth that shee bringeth foorth: so that ther will wan no care and vigilancey in the Creator, for succour and maintenance and preservation of the creature (who will not sleep) from the shadow of the word from Ierusalem, on their right hand, that is on their south side, and instruction from thence. And so all things may bee possible unto them, for their deliverance, to keep them that they fall into no ill wayes, that no season or weather, shall hurt them. That they bee not sunn bunt and scorched with infamy and ignominious reproche: and bee safe from the greatest dominions on either side, round about them. That all their goeing out and in, all their Exodus, and leading of their lives from morning till evening, and from day to day, shall bee with security, from time to time for ever. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to inviron, as standers by one, or to one, as helpers and assisters, Ps. 94. a shadow at the right hand, for a Defendour and a Protec∣tor. Ps. 16. Ier. 3. And a looker to. Caph, of Caphaph, to bow or bend: his feet shall not be stirred by captivity. Hee that keepeth him will not sleep & let him be taken, but will see him safe foorth & home, by day & by night. Caph, a hand: for help & shadow & saveing, &c. Ex. 33. Aleph, for instruction: hee meaneth by the great builder & instru∣ctor: his tutor and keeper of the way of his life, Ge. 3. Ps. 146.91. Mark the repetition. Deuteronomy. Heer the rehearsall is of the God of kindenes him self: the Eternall, so often repeated. And God of truthe: that is so infinit in his mercey and compassion.
That takeeth in hand all misery and all calamity to cure, Ps. 146. How vigilant hee is, It is wonderfull, for the salvation of his people, according to his word that sleepeth not. Ps. 33. Ehje, and Jehovah, Are terms of greeff, Eze. 7. Is. 47. and greeff and woe keepeth wakeing; greeff moveth compassion, and that is the Eternall, Is. 54. that sen∣deth and pittyeth, &c. Ex. 3.33. Ma. 24. Mark the efficacey of the wordes. Eternall, keep, preserve, &c. goeing out and in, life, &c. PSALM. CXXII. THough I had all faith, that I could remove mountaines, and had not love, it were nothing: love is better then any sacrifice, love fullfilleth the Law, love is the end of the comandemment. Ro. 13. 1. Tim. 1. Math. 22. Ther∣for hee that judgeth rightly of it, is not far from the kingdom of God. The peace of God passeth all understanding, and keepeth the hart in knowledge and love of him; therfor except the church bee well seasoned with knowledge, and have peace one with an other: faith is not so dureable, so firm, so constant and so forceible. For without knowledge followeth no beleeff, nor any conclusion, without circumstance. nor any rock without a sound demonstration, nor effect without charity: which is, by mariage and Affinity of consequencees, and aptnes and likeing by conjugation▪ that whatsoever can bee concludeed, likeed, and also agreed upon, by the Church, what ever it bee: that undoubtedly is made possible. Therfor all is to bee don in Love, for love hath boldnes, and ther is no fear in love. So what can bee beleeued, but that which the love and affectation and combination of the causes, & concord in all moodes may perform? or what beleeff in Christ, except, the ground work bee love? for knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. And for this hee prooveth the amiablenes of Ierusalem and the glory of the Church of God, and allurements therunto, Psalm. 87. (to abide in the Law of God is to keep his commandements) by the construction: the re∣sort, the Excercise, for fraternity, freendship & acquaintance, & the house of God that is in it; for which hee loveeth it moste deerly, and wisheth peace about it, and prosperity within it, and that all may prosper that love it; and delighteeth so much, to goe up unto it, and remain in it. Construction. Quoph, of Iaquaph, to compass or inviron: as by the trenches and palacees, that are about the citty, for peace. Alludeing to the Name of the citty, Is. 20.32.60, Ps. 48.147. By their greeting and saluteing and freendly wishes, is meant their manner, which is bowing, for Caph, the second letter, as Mich. 6. by bidding & wishing their welth and peace, as Math. 10. Lu. 10. Caph, for the soles of the feet. Ierusalem, becaus ther were the cheeff thrones and Assemblyes. Bth, a hous, is heer by the hous of the Eternall: and the hous of David, &c. Also the tribes, or branches for houses. Mark all the repeating of the termnes. Deuteronomy. They say that in Ierusalem men ought to worship. Io. 4. Deu. 12.16. This is the place of repeating and admireing, & recreating of all flesh with the word, and remembrance of all God his works and goodnes to them, Ps. 65. which they fre∣quented; and whither they solemnly resorted therfor: Zach. 14. Mark the repetition and commendation of it. Both for preaching and judgeing and correcting of them. PSALM CXXIII. BY these degrees they get up into celestiall dwellings, highe placees, and roomes of godlynes and spirituall understanding, by which all principality and power is subdueed, and the captiveers them selves captiveed, as Ps. 68. And they are made a complet building and temple of holynes, and divine knowledge, and replenished with the fullnes of God. From which Asscension and cogitation beeing
higher then any heaven: all degrees of Ministers according to their measure and gift for th gathering of the Saincte, are furnished. Eph. 4. Now that this Psalme and the former, as they touch, so that they may bee seen to concern ech other: mark the proper∣ty of love, it suffereth long and beareth all things. And again becaus God hath his whole dwelling in these heavenly placees, and they are in so base esteem, and skorned (among the proud Quiescents, by them that are at case) for their poverty, by which they have long remained in great derision; as servants stedfastly look and gape and tend at their masters handes for meat and wagees: so the Churches eyes are bent unto the fa∣ther of spirits, looking for som spirituall grace, that hee will pitty them and give them som heavenly reward and victory and salvation. For their singular suffering and wait∣ing. Construction. Grace mercy and peace, the comun safegard of the Apostles is heer the invironing, for Quoph, the first letter, by doubling of the termn pitty: as also of the name Eternall. For countenance, Exod. 33. Psal. 84. The contrary, is skorn and con∣tempt, that they have their fill of in time of captivity, by proud invadeers. Like the frozen and setled ones, Zeph. 1. The despisers and deriders, Iob. 12. Ne. 4. Mat. 6. Luc. 16. Pro. 30. Caph, of Caphaph, the second letter, to bow, oppressed, made to stoop & bowed. Ghimel, the third letter, reward: the giveing of grace and countinance for their waiting, as fit gifts for children. And this, as it is the work of the eye, Prov. 30. So hee that dwelleth in the heavens, the great regarder and great derideer is prayed unto, Psal. 2. Mak the repetition through out agreeing. Deuteronomy. Hee that prayeth unto God, doth glorifye God, Psal. 50. hee that commeth unto God, confesseth that God is: his praying for countenance, is as much as confessing and publishing of his grace, and repeating of his eternall life, and everla∣sting way, and wonderfull work of salvation. Thes 15 Psalmes have a figurative excell∣ence in them, Is. 38. returning, and reciteing, and climeing higher and higher, to heaven and understanding, by words. PSALM CXXIV. MOnt Sion was the glory of Ierusalem, and the Musitians the glory of Sion, as Psal. 87. and thes Psalmes the glory of the Musitians. The mery songs of Sion, which they so much longed to hear, and inquireed for, in Babilon, Ps. 137 by which men are sung alive again from death, every Psalme beeing a step from misery, and a step to honour, and that of the Kingdom of heaven: from the greatest ignorance and darknes, to the greatest knowledge and light. Heerby, the Apostles sing open the prison doores, and sing off the bandes of their feet (for the word of God is not bound, Psal. 68. Act. 16. 2. Tim. 2.) and take the keeper prisoner. For heer is a new earth, a new citty and a new Sion, and a new tabernacle of God with men, and a new and a heavenly knowledge in man, a new man which captiveeth all power, and can not bee captiveed. The fruit of the spirit beeing in all goodnes righteousnes and truthe, sendeth out such hymnes and Psalmes and spirituall songes of thanks, of melody in their hartes for salvation; that maketh all manner of subjection captivity, and bonds and im∣prisonment tolerable. God is ever good unto his people, and ever neer his elect, as Ps. 73 to glorify his chosen, as Psal. 84.86. when all the troubles and malice and anger in the world, aros and kindled against them. And hee cracketh all the building and plots of the Enimye, by his goodnes & kindenes, when hee is called upon, as Ps. 118. After long waiting, as Ps. 40. and great affliction, as Ps. 90.109. when the people of God bee even eaten up alive, with reproche, and scornful biteing and defamation at the handes of the proud: at last God useeth to bee good and gratious and mercyfull and comfortable unto them, by takeing thē, out of thos lions jawes, which in long gapeing get the cramp and neuer close again. And though a world of nations, like stoods of Enimyes, set upon them: yet ther is that dullnes in their understanding, and sottery in proceeding, &
dissention, and division, and imperfection in the manifacture of their cordes, which they lay, that they are soon brokeen: for the devill beeing author of confusion & of discord: they no better agree one with another, then they agree with the Church, and their work is soon destroyed. For the works of discord are not stong nor durable. And thus oftē times, by the muteny of the Enimye the Church is safe: as in Aegypt, Assur, Babilon, &c. Absolom, &c. wher the salvation of the Godly is out of the sight of the wicked, and they have a miraculous deliverance, and all by their invocation and calling upon the Name of God, and serving of their Creator, as 92. which in due time heareth, yf they faint not. And this is the Experience and hope which they have by patience, wherby this Psalme suiteth with the former. Construction. Quoph, of Jaquaph, to invion, is of the compassing of the Eimy by the abundance and inundation of them: compared to the swelling of Iordan and the proud warrs of the men of Adam, & their invasion, Ios. 3. of the Church, Iob 22. Ps. 42.116. Ier. 12. Ion. 1. The opposition is Gods present assistance and standing to them and with them, by his existens and name Iehovah. And about them in helping, Rom. 8. Consider the first and last wordes doubled. Caph, for bowing down, and pressing of the Enimye in captivity: by snares and waters, to wit, the 70 of Babel. See the affecting of Iod, with Zain, in Azza, and in Zedonim, to be multiplyed for 70. as Zain & Gnain, Ps. 25.34. Daleth, a door, is Gods discipline and remedy, as the Medes and Persians, to dissolve the captivity of the Babylonians. Mark the repetition to all. Deuteronomy. Thes songes of return bee sufficient confssion of Gods mercyfull, and miraculous deliverance, which hee would have the Church still in minde of, and to use them for repetitions, as beeing so much bound for their salvation, to him. PSALM CXXV. THey that beleeve not, shall not bee established. Righteousnes. and God, and the Kingdom of God is the same thing: for other gifts of government are conteined in it. Ther is no stedfastnes but in justice, nor any trust or beleeff or assurance but in the everlastingnes therof, becaus, for this are Gods people immutable and immov∣able, haveing the light of the Law, and the glory therof shineing about them, to guard them for ever. That ther shall no wicked dominion, Lordship or punishment rest wher the righteous dwell, becaus they doo not wrong, as Psal. 15. and that the wicked doo overgripe themselves, that medle with them, and are forceed to loos their hold, and re∣leas their captivityes. Therfor hee that seeketh righteousnes seeketh all, and hee that seeketh it, findeeth all. It is found in the Law, called the face of God, as Psal. 24. that pure Israel only seeketh, and is blessed therwith. The Church now prayeth for judge∣ment: favour to the upright, strait and plain mindeed men; and condemnation to the variable and crooked, and declineers in hell, with the mischevous and evill dooers, as Ps. 5. That Israel may once have peace, and the Ark have rest, and the Church never faile. Mat. 16. Construction. Quoph, the compassing heer is in the term about, as the hills, and the eternall Existence. God doth guard his people by his providence: the wicked shall not rest among them for fear of corrupting them: the confident and faithfull shall not miscarry, no more then hills or rockes, Mat. 16. and this is the Eternall presence of God, & the faithfull according to the third letter, He, behold, and the absence of the wicked that must not com nighe the Righteous. The faithfull are defined: good and upright, strait and direct in their harts, against declineers and benders, and wrong and crooked wayes: and this for Caph, to bend or crook also. So the cherishing of the good and the banishing of molesters, is the way of peace. Caph, a hand, or a shaft or rod, as of the wic∣ked. Mark the repetition. Deuteronomy. Ieshurun, and Israel are acted, as Deut. 32. Ies. 44. that the uprightnes of Israel should bring peace to Israel. What is Israel but a quint-offence of
uprightenes, and pureity, to whom, God useeth to bee beneficiall? Mark Jesharim and Israel: all they that trust &c. his people, all the righteous, all good and upright, &c. and this may serve for a rehearsall also. PSALM. CXXVI. YF God bee made unto us wisdom, righteousnes and sanctification and redemp∣tion: hee that rejoyceth, let him rejoice in the Lord, for highe degrees of know∣ledge, and exaltation into a paradise of revelation. Let him rejoyce in the ser∣vice and worship of him, and the calling upon his Name, as Ps. 92. in the time of peace, for in troubles when they are not with themselves, they are farr from God, and can not com nighe him in time of wrath, as Psal. 32. Now out of the greatest sorrow springs the greatest joy, and out of abundance of suffering, abundance of consolation: and the Church hath been often fetched out of the mire, and deep pit of destruction, and the midst of hell, Ps. 69.130. and by the mercyes of God; in keeping still life in them, in their captivityes, and raising them again and redeeming them, from the torment and thralldom of their consciences and themselves, to the wonder of the world, yea in the sight of the Heathen: which useeth to strike such passion of joy into the veines and hart of them, that they could not choos but laugh and sing in their sleep, for their peace and redemption, which was their whole affection and waiting beeing awake: and in this they had their full desires, that their joyes might bee full. Now confessing and magni∣fying Gods great works of kindenes toward them before, in divers reductions of them from divers countryes: they pray that hee would now, by that example, bring them again from the rest, as the Southeren rivers, return & flow from the south: that out of a heavy seednes of deprivation, they beeing scattered and sowen thus among the heathen; ther may bee a joyfull return of them, like a merry and fruitfull harvest of Sheaves. Construction. Quoph, is heer returning, & comming about, or back again as the dayes of the yeer, Ps. 19. 2. Sam. 11. Iob 1. For the dayes of life, Is. 38. also bringing about, or to pass, or compassing, or effecting much, &c. Caph, of Caphaph, to bow or bend, the lamentable depressing of them; Psal. 146. captivity and holding, and seed lep, and sheaves, and gripes, for Caph, a hand also. Vau, a crook, or hook: for their deportation and redemption also, and for fellowship: so heer is a time to weep, and a time to laugh, Eccl. 2. counterfeteed upon the story of Ishak for the mery return of the promissed seed, with so great increas, Am. 7. Gen. 16.17.21. Gal. 4. Is. 1. Rom. 9. By the word Laughter, &c. The name of Isaak. Mark the repetition, Psal. 14.53. Deuteronomy. They increased and grew in their bondage, like that in Aegypt, as men fed in their sleep and grown fat, Iob. 39. and multiplyed in their captivity, which was a great work of Gods mercey and kindenes, for the heathen to note, and to make them merry. PSALM CXXVII. OVt of joy proceedeth comfort & consolation, in this Psalme & the next: the Churches sheaves of posterity, and other gifts of peace, for the rest and peace of the Church. becaus the idolatrous care of this world chokeeth the joy in the Kingdom of God, and stifleth all comfort and consolation in the word, and in the holy Ghost: and because the Church hath all their reward and strength by inheritance from the service of God, Ps. 16. and the Prophets are the barrs of the citty gates, Ps. 147 and all comfort and quietnes, secureity and boldnes against theyr Enimyes, by youthfull fruitfullnes of a Godly issue, and are moste blessed from the love of him: In this Psalme, from Salomons overmuch preparation, for Rehoboam, a simple sonne: the vanity of to much provision, is moste wisely describeed. For heerin, men fall into divers
temptations: when their work is not spirituall, nor their building God. For they build with things not theirs, and for want of due right, and property, there wanteth concord, and for want of concord, no construction or building can go up, or stick together; nor no care in the world can keep such together; that which God provideth not. As in the building of Babel. Gen. 11. and edification in stange tonges: for in Babel, the stones of Ierusalem will not serve for building: they can make no workmanship of them: they feed upon Idolatry, and labour in vain: walls nor watchmen can hold them; they know not what to doo with these spirituall stones, but send them home as the Philistns did the Ark. Construction. Quoph, to inviron, is the building for defence, and strong watch about the citty. The house of Israel cannot be safe and sure, but upon the covenants and pro∣mises of God, and instructions of the word. this psalme is to be construed from Gen. 15: 2. Sa. 12. 2. Cro. 23. La. 3. 1. Cro. 22. 1. Cor, 3. Pro. 8. the restoring of the captivi∣ty is the reward of children Ier. 31. as well as the birth, ps. 2. for building, Gen. 16.30. Caph, bowed, Caph, a hand, to contein, or quiver, or belly, arrows, and children: See build, builders, hous, citty, children, fruit of the womb, children of youth, arrows, they shall bring forth their building with pain and sorrow, opposed to contentment: for neither walls nor watching can save their citty: but good education and godlines. Zain to hear, or conceive the doctrine of the word, or edification, such is Gods building, and such are his children, as it is good to build, and not a vain thng: but a thing that will indure. He writes upon Gnir, a citty, which is derived from Gnir, to erect or build and also to watch. Therefore he usth all kindes both of building and watching, and by sundry termnes. mark the repetition. Deuteronomy. The children of God are well edified, and no better defens nor security can be, than good edification out of his word: it is a blessed thing to abound with them, and not a vain thing. He sheweth: it is the Lords work to restore them, and that they can∣not stand nor consist without him: which is a wonderfull kindenes: the contenting and blessing of his beloved. PSALM CXXVIII. A Mischeevous end belongeth to the wicked, by reason of falsshood and deceit, but to the godly and just man, no temptation shall take them, but that which they may well bear, neither shall one bone of them be broken, or any tempta∣tion impaire them at all, that truely follow the way to peace: but (for all hap∣pines) their labours of their hands shall follow them, and stick unto them, to cherish them. It shall be good and dureable becaus of the equity thereof, chiefly, their wives: the greatest blessings: they shall have them to stick fast to the hous sides, shewing their love: they shall have no wandering thoughts, but be ever about the house, so that hr husband never want her, nor suffer widdowhood; and she shall be fruitfull, to imbol∣den him; she shall bring up his children to stick round about his table, to grace him; and that there be no dispersion: and that he shall see one generation under another, of children, dureing the peace and wealth of the church, which he shall see all his life. In Ierusalem dwelt of all nations, men that feared God, that were learned in the kingdom of God, and could speak this language of righteousnes, and peace, and other gifts of the holy ghost (being not in word but in power) one to another, beeing of divers coun∣treys. For in this is the Church greatly beholding to God, and is to thank him for it, because they are made rich in all kinde of speech, and knowledge, and doctrine of the holy ghost, that they bee not destitute of any gift: and hereby they speak all one thing, with one accord, and without dissention, beeing of one minde, and of the same iudge∣ment. The gifts of the minde are heavenly gifts, and no musique is comparable to them, nor any kingdome to that government, and the harmony thereof, but to the sweetnes of concord, and of peace, when all agree to hold together by it, as the souldure or
band of the rest: no one gift can be equalled thereunto. Peace joyneth all nations toge∣ther and reconcileth them in Christ: that they are no longer strangers of foreiners: but all neer kin and well acquainted in Christ, and citizens with the saints, and of the hous∣hold of God. Heer is an high coronation, and heerby men raign as kings: when all is thus tuned and brought in peace, peace-offerings are due, and such sacrifice as this of thanks to be sung. Therfor, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, or pure or be∣long to love, or of good report: if there be any vertue, or if there be any prais: these things are to be thought upon, and the God of peace shall be with them. For in whom dwelleth the fulnesse of these things: he it is that reconcileth all and setteth at peace, even Christ: this is the unworldly peace that God giveth, that the heart be never troubled not in fear, and which overcommeth all affliction in the world: And thus are they sancti∣fied throughout, and by peace are made happy that are the children and servants of God. Construction Quoph, of Jaquaph, to compasse, is his wife, the vines wedded to the house sides and his children waiting at the tabl, for helps & good additions to him. Caph, for bowing, or subjection, like the obedient vine, & olive plants, alludeing to Cip∣path, a vine branch, as Caph, a hand &c. Cheth to fear, as Mal. 2. Hee sheweth what is no vain work, but a blessed work, and what the blessings bee: consider the doubling of the words: happy, blessed, welth, well, peace, loe: and so alluding to the name Ierusalem, they shall see peace. children, fear, &c. Hee worketh evermore upon the divers sens of the word. Deutronomy. the confession heer is, what felicity there commeth of a godly life: they have their harts desire: and they shall be blessed out of Zion with eternall life: they shall have posterity and peace, and all delight with it. ps. 37. with the kinde God will shew himself kinde, &c. ps. 18. The story of Abraham is again thought upon, as Gen. 12. for his blessing. &c. Hee will blesse them that blesse him. &c. Luk. 1. PSALM. CXXIX. ALl the culture and tillage of the wicked is upon the backs of the godly: that is, their whole field, where they sow all mischeif, is a spoiling, and defacing of their lives, and all the pains they take is against them. They overlode them, as Ps. 68. they urge them, torment them and constrein them, and overwork them, and tire them with temptation, they drive them, and pursue them, that the whip is never off their backs, and all their devises, cogitations, and plots are to destroy them. And for this they draw all together, and are a teem alwayes harnessed, ps. 83. and ready to plow vpon them, and ride them. And this the Church found in Egypt, Edom, and Mo∣ab, in Canaan, in Ashur, and Babilon, in great measure, and with great continuance; yea out of measure and without casing. yea though they galled them sore, and prevai∣led not: yet they never give over, they are never at lands end, they never throw up the plow, their furlongs are endles, and their enmity lasteth still. They must suffer crosses that will live godly, and they must long bear that will be blessed, and the crosses of the church for their profession, are innumerable: by tyranny, fear, threatning: treacherie, robbing, revenge; wars, captivities, and other trialls, and they make an excercise of bearing of them. They are to be commended for this high degree of patience, which they call long-suffering, a great gift of government. Such crosses and affliction and tribulation must be undergone and carried, and must be rejoyced in, for that glorious victory and coronation of them that endure and hold out, and overcome, and are ex∣cellent in those uncarnall thoughts, and, spirituall gifts of the minde promised. Thus is the loss of life, the salving and preserving of it, the changing of a worse for a better; that tribulation bringing patience, and patience bringing experience, and experience hope, and hope the things hopeed for: that men be not ashamed of their hope, or the vanitie thereof, as Ps. 25. Now because this is the justice of God to succour the Iust. and a just thing with him, to recompnse vengeance to the troublers of the godly, and to
them that hate them for the word: the church prayeth, that it may be after this sort, that even still one thing for another, and like for like; for envying Zion and the prosperity therof, and of all the Church: nothing may prosper that they put their hands too, and they may be ashamed of every purpose, and fail of all their attempts against it. Ps. 132. that God would cut their harness that they draw by, unyoke them and uncouple them, and chop their weethes and cords in peeces, & destroy utterly their husbandry, that they may retire with shame, availing themselves nothing, but retire and take off their hands for shame and their purposes may wither, and all their thoughts be extinguished, and stare out their eies with looking for, and become mad with their hope, and cut off ere they see their desires: That they may labour for nothing, and they may be ashamed of their crop, that for nothing bear malice and hatred and arms against it; that they may have neither harvest nor blessing of all their plots and devises, to delight them. Construction. Quoph, to compasse or inviron is heer to afflict, of Zarar, to gird strait or strain hard or wring or oppress: by which word, three times and three severall wayes is the number 490 conteined and expressed, to signifie the determining of the judgements of God upon Israel, though long, euen seventy sevenfold. Gods justice cuts the band of wrong, and sets them at libertie and releaseth them out of the hands of Satan, their captivity & sore distress. Caph, bowing or stooping, is the plowing upon their backs and oppressing of them, by so long ridges upon them. there is a ridge of furrows, and a ridge of a house or hous top, for a back: as they torment one kinde, that the other may fail, and they may turn the back. Caph, a hand also: for holding and griping &c. oppression is rewarded with improsperitie, as the wicked keep down the Church: so they accursed for want of maintenance do fade. Teth, to decline and bow, also for the soil where the tillage is. Mark the repetition of the words. Hee is still in the story of Abraham, hee will curs them that curs him &c. Gen. 12. Ps. 80. Deuteronomy. Hee observeth the frequent and sore adversity of Israel from a childe, yet God still mainteined them, and cut off their enimies: therefore they should justly confess him. They that hate the church shall be accursed. PSALM CXXX. THis is the way unto Abrahams bosom, this way men know Abraham and keep him company in the kingdom of God, prepareing for grace and mercy and not for justice and judgement Ps, 143. The Church weighing their iniquity, and their suffering: they finde their afflictions nothing to their deserts. And weighing their afflictions with the glory that they look for: they finde their crosses short of it, and not to be accounted worthy of such an eternall weight as is promised to the children of God, by their adoption which live in admiration of all spirituall glory, and not of temporall things: which by suffering are made heirs, and com unto the king∣dom of God: and so rare and so high a calling and freedom, from corrupt slavery of sinn. For this cause is every creature of God brought under hope, and waiteth continu∣ally, to see their day of redemption; and considering their vanity with unexpressible fervency, grone for it; and the spirit, that knoweth their minde helpeth them. By which hope and long waiting, in as much as it is with all stedfastnes, as Ps. 40. they get their degree in the kingdome of God; and are saved, with much rejoycing and continuall prayer, never to be ashamed of. This hope commeth by patience, and comfott of the scriptures; becaus all thes afflictions happen to him for love to the word, and observ∣ing Gods commandements, Ps. 119. Z. Sh, Which hope is laid up for them in heaven, to be fullfilled with all knowledge and spirituall understanding, and the mystery of God, by the grace of God. And heerof have you for example;; Noah, Daniel, and Iob: their blessed end. This hope is for things not to bee seen, all things working for the best thus their degree: to bee predestinated, and called, and chosen, and justified, and glorified, and saved. Therfor no tribulation, nor no persecution, nor famine,
nor nakednes, nor perill, nor sword, nor any other adversity or prosperitie, loss or preferment, present or future, high or low or any thing els in the world, can cut off their waiting for this glory, and this kingdom: but they shew themselves approved in all things, and tryed men in all crosses of the world; which are the very Accents of holines. And for this is their uncessant calling upon God, in their deep distresses, not to regard their sinnes and iniquities. but seeing he was so reverend, for pardon and forgivenes, and was so kinde and so full of redemption: which is the hope of Gods calling: and that he would hear him, and set Israel in the right way, forgive him, and redeem him; and this with an exceeding hope, more then that of the watchmen, for their rst. Construction. Quoph, to compas, iniquities, Ps. 49. Deeps Ion. 2. Ps. 69. where ther is no standing: so all are cast by iniquities which have hold of them. Lamed, learn∣ing, is waiting, and attending, and contending, redemption, and forgivenes, and releas of captivity, and bondage of the divell and all their enimies, Is. 64. Ier. 33.31. Prov. 16. Neh. 9. Hos. 14. both the letters make Quol,, a voice, the Lords attention, and revealing of his word, releaseth and redeemeth, being full of pardon and grace. Quol, is taken also for word, which is the promised forgivenes. and redemp∣tion from trspass. This belongeth to Rulers and therfor Lord, is doubled. Quol, al∣so is thunder, which is terrible judgement out of the word, that no man is able to abide it. Qual is gentle, light, and easy: as is forgivenes. Mark well the repetition of all the termns, and reckoning of the kindes: of voices, waitings, and forgivenes &c. His waiting is to be set once free of his crosses and his incumbrances, which he calls iniqui∣ties, by proper grace of the Eternall. Like a servants waiting for his maisters comming. Mat. 24. Deuteronomy. It is wrought upon the story of Iacobs wrestling Gen. 21.32. Hos. 12. and waiting and earnest request is a kinde of wrestling for grace. As Iacob wrestled: so Israel must wait. Mark the doubling of Israel, and repeating of Lord so oft, to signifie might and power of prevailing, uppon El, in Isra-el the mighty. And this re∣citeth a wonderfull grace and blessing of God, and kindenes to his people. PSALM CXXXI. BLessed are the poor in spirit, the lowly and meek, the humble and quiet mind∣ed men, and such as suffer persecution for righteousness; for they shall raign and excell in heavenly gifts, and also inherit the earth, Ps. 37. And be call∣ed the children of God. O Zion, behold, thy king commeth, meekly sitting up∣pon an ass. By meeknes and gentlenes, every thought and imagination against God, and every high thing is cast down and captiveed, and subdued and made nothing worth. for all the kingdome of God is in suffering, and willing and gentle submission and obedience; by which; by haveing themselves in command: they overcome and cast down invincible holds. A little contenteth these men, and all things are bestowed upon them: they seek the celestiall kingdome, and riches of godlines, and want no∣thing that is good: so, as when they suffer, it is in hope, and also in meeknes, not grudgeing, nor resisting, nor murmuring: therfor he subdueth his mind from high con∣ceits and far and forrein hopes, and great and secret things to the plain and easy things of the law and commandments, neer at hand, and hard by him. In this subjection he hath his minde by the Law, that meekly waiteth on him like a wainling: so that the Law and hee, are inseparable, and his minde alwayes a companion with God, by haveing his word alwayes in his mouth, and in his heart; and thus he would have Israel wait upon God for ever. Construction. Quoph, to compass, is heer the compassing of the heart; the wilde affection of the minde. Eccl. 7. Is. 10. Ps. 101. Pro. 6. known by thes tokens, the lust of the flesh, and of the eyes, and pride of life: all worldly aspireing and ambitious
appetite, 1, Ioh. 2. not fit for a scholler. Lamed, and Alph, for learning, and instruction: they make Lo, not so, that hee is no such: but humble and a reformed man, meek and docible, fit to attend doctrine, and the pleasure and kindenes of God. He is not carried away with pride and worldly pleasure, but is content to be taught: as a childe his A. B, Ce. Is. 28. and so hee sheweth by a double mention of the first letters of the rew. And is contented with the things revealed, Deut. 29. And so hee would have Israel to bee perpetually. All the three letters make Quala, to dis-esteem, as hee was vile in his own eyes. Mark these words repeated: soul, waiting, not, &c. and words varyed: high, lofty, great, hard, opposed to tame, and plain, and wained, &c. as Aspireing to con∣tentment. Deuteronomy. All waiting of Israel is for grace and kindenes, and performance of promiss to such as bee fitt, and adopted, and chosen, &c. while Israel serveth, &c. PSALM. CXXXII. THer is a majesty of Godlines, & ther is a heavenly countenance of pure religion, but zeal and devotion make the dignity therof: that a man may be found ap∣prooved, and in all pointes perfect and holy before God. Which is hee shewed by Davids vow, and the Lords, considering both: that is, the place that David so de∣vourly sought for, and found: the Lord so much delighted and affected. And becaus their affections so met, and their harts so well agreed: and because God promissed to David, all benefit of salvation from Sion, by the Priesthood: and aflowershing and a lerned, and a dureing estate of the Kingdom, yf hee kept his covenant: and that hee will victuall the citty well with the word of God, Psal. 81. and confound his eni∣myes therwith; till they blush and retire therat: hee prayeth God now to take his rest upon his holy hill, and by the strength of his Law, Ps. 99. the Ark of judgement and right, to send it, that the Priests may preach righteousnes, Ps. 40. and the people doo all worship, and the queristers sing out aloud, holy, holy, holy, and highly sanctifye the God of Sabboth; with all habit and behaviour of holynes. That the anointed may never remove, or turn back again, but seek unto their patience, and faith and love and spirituall knowledge, & provide for all their wants, that nothing may bee wanting, but that they may overcom in their triall, and bee refreshed in the paradise of God, bee made Kings and weare the crown of Eternall life, and be fed with the scriptures, and to receive holy names in the book of life, never to be blotted. And reign over nations, & bee like ever∣lasting pillers in the temple, with new names of their new creation, graven upon them, & sit in the throne of Godlynes, blessed with all dignity and honour; by thes keyes of knowledge, that open all undeniable truthe & shut the mouthes of fashood; that binde∣eth the divill and Satan hand and foot, in his arguments and casteh him into utter darknes, and giveeth cleer light to them that sit in darknes: and that hee would dissolve the chains of ignorance, of them that walk in absurdity, and redeem them and save them.

Hee reckoneth heer all the kindes of rests that can bee imagined, because it is Gods rest; and that by doubling the word, Tabernacle, hous, bed, sleep, dwelling, habitation, footstool, right doctrine, a joyfull Ministry, their Anoynted, throne, meat, and bred of salvation, a flowrishing, crown, their anoynted, and shame to their Enimyes: neither is hee unminde∣full of the Quiescents grammaticall, as in the word Jvva, hee desired, doubled.

Sion is the place hee hath chosen to be served and glorifyed in, Deut. 2. for a perpetuall countenance to his elect, and a shame to their foes, yf they ob∣serve his word and keep his covenant: the life therof shall bee their life for ever, Deut. 32. and they shall not bee stirred. PSALM CXXXIII. THe Church beeing setled in a quiet conscience, and haveing a peacable King∣dom within them: hee now commeth to the admiration of the goodnes and the benefit, the glory and the sweetnes of it. Wher hee makeeth the subjects all of one degree: wher ther is no difference, between the servant and the sonne, male and female, servant and servant, far or neer: ther beeing one maister and father and reconcileer unto all; for they are both by grace and both by adoption: nor between Iew and gentile, bond or free; for ther is a redemption from bondage, and a freedom from servitude, to which, as well they in the house as out of the hous, are predestinated o becom all alike the children of God, beeing led by the spirit of God. And thus Christ was before Abraham, and thus Abraham rejoyced to see his dayes, by haveing the same Kingdom and religion in his bosom. So that ther is no priority or preheminence heer, to take place: and as they are all children and sonnes of God by faith: so they are all heires, and all part-takeers of the Kingdom and blessednes therof, as they have been part-takeers of the suffering belonging to it. And therfor are they called brethe∣ren, for all have one and the same birth & parentage, haveing the same conceites, dooing the same workes, leading the same lives, minde the same thinges, knit together all in one minde, beeing of the same study & affection, the same indevour, & the same subjection, and the same protestation; and this in the same service of God, the father and maister, in all holynes, and rightheousnes, when all their hartes agree in all things, and God with them: how admirable (inded may they say) is their dwelling together, It yeeldes a sweet prospect; for how sweet are the sermons of righteousnes that flow over the Priests lips, and drop down his beard, and the gift of grace and the indument of them, that runneth down, all the coat of Levi, from highe to low, even to the skirts and the doctrine that falleth upon them, as the dew upon the grass. The is no ointment so sweet and good, nor rain so pleasant, as thes savery showers of heavenly understanding, and spirituall blessings, and everlasting life, when as from hill to hill, one hart lendeth an∣other grace, and knowledge, and peace & joy eternall, in a quiet minde.

Wher two or three are gathered together, &c. Mat. 18. Mark the repetition all things resembling unity and proprity: pleasant, pretious, beard, runn down, &c. Deuteronomy. The confession heer is, the life of the word, the blessing of it, to them that concurr in observing is, as the congregation: the wonderfull refreshing they have by that ordinance, and favour of God, by destilling of doctrine upon the assembly, as ointment on the beard, &c.

The whole law of God is a tree of abstinence, as taste not, touch not, doo not, handle not, to bridle the will; that, bee it a thing that makes never so faire a shew, for any kinde of respect: it must bee refreined and aoyd∣ed: and so work by the Ministry and a perpetuall thanks giveing by the Minsters, never ceasing. Sabbath day to be useed, so that the refreining from pleasure, and cove∣teousnes fullfilleth all, Psal. 119. H, for hee that liveth in pleasure is sayd to bee dead while hee liveth, and to bee a sleep in it, and drunk therwith, and apt to all temptation. Except God bee in a man, the body is dead, & the greatest holynes in the world is to re∣tire one self, and walk with God, to forbear: and the greaest government in a man, is to bridle himself. And therfor hee willeth the servants of God that keep holy, and rest, that keep hous with him, and dwell in the Lords hous, by night, and abstein from la∣bour and fowling their handes upon any work: to lift up their hands, of so high holy∣nes and sanctification, and bless this everlasting righteousnes of God. For bestowing the same blessing upon them, even everlasting life. And that as God, in six dayes, made heaven and earth, &c. & rested the seventh and blessed & sanctifyed it: so for keeping the same, they may receive from him, likewise, the blessing of sanctification throughout. Construction.

Mark the wordes: bless, and Eternall, servant, stand, &c. how oft the one implyeth the other. Hee workes upon the double sens of Berek, to bless, to which, heer is prayed a blessing, and also to give it. See the only doubling of that termn & the Eternall. And this is for a dore, as knocking and opening, &c. Deuteronomy. This blessing intendeth confession of the goodnes and grace of God, and comfort which they receive from the place which God hath chosen, Deut. 12. from Sion, the blessed word of creation out of rudenes. Wherin is life, &c. Ioh. 1. PSALM CXXXV. WHat was hard to suffer is now sweet to remember. Great is his goodnes that bringeth peace and redemption; and sweet and pleasant is his name, that hath made chois of the Church, and hath pleasure in them, and giveth them their inheritance, and defendeth and comfort∣eth them: and a good and sweet hearing it is, that hee hath brought them out of slavey, into the Elysian feelds of salvation and saveed them: & this by a transscendent power, meteoricall and miraculous: by an invisible safety: setting his hand upon their Eni∣myes face, as Psal. 138. beclouding the Scriptures with an earthly sense, and makeing from thence lightning of Sermons, for rain of doctrine, from one end of the world to the other: as was the glittering of that comming of the sonn of Man, in power and great glory; and to bring out the deep & hid sens out of his treasure, to smite all the Kinges of the earth, and astonish them; that ther is no such God among the heathen, of all their pretious Idoles which they follow, as Ps. 16. and that hee knoweth and confesseth, that hee which they serv, is the greatest above Gods and Kings, and Lords, Ps. 95. and to bee preferred only, and meet to bee chosen before all other gods. Therfor, because his doctrine is the tillage and manureance of all the earth: wee must sue unto the Word, the creator of our understanding, which seeth in secret and bringeth foorth an opn reward;
no man knowing the father but the sonn, and hee, to whom the sonn wil reveale him▪ And therfor, hee wisheth, that all men would prais his name; especially his hous hold servantes, remaining in his courts, for his goodnes; and chaunt out, for the pleasantnes of his name, as Ps. 92. and that Israel, the Church and Ministry, and all the Professors of of Godlynes, and all Ierusalem, may thank him therfor, from Sion.

Hezek-jah shall see Jah, Iah, in the land of the living, that is, fifteen yeers alive, Is. 38. The letter, He behold, that is the presence of God: the cloudes, and lightnings, and windes, present him, his strokes upon his Enimyes, his signes, and deliverance, all markable. Qualah, which conteine all the letters, is to be light, and vile in repute, by which hee magnifyeth the power of God and vilifyeth the idoles, that have no aspiration or sound in their throat, like Iah, Psal. 149. nor smiteing like Iod, a hand. Mark the repetition. Deuteronomy. The confession is continuall praising and blessing of God and his name, by the Ministry and whole Church of God. So sweet and pleasant, for the benefit. PSALM. CXXXVI. HEe sheweth that all was don in the Creation, by intellectuall power, and that that highe Godhead and soveraigne Lordship only, did with his mighty hand, and long reaching arm, all the wonderfull works in the world, of his goodnes and his mercey, Psal. 23. and his everlasting Kingdom of kindenes and com∣passion: in cutting off the ungodly, and saveing of the Church: in thinking upon them in their low estate, and setling them in their enimyes land, and provideing food for all flesh, the unperishing food of his word: the searching wherof, is the bread of eternall life, and an everlasting nuriture. So the wicked are visited justly, for ignorant worship and workmanship, to the sowerth degree, of the ungodly and disobedient: but his mercy is to last for thousands, even for ever, to the Godly and obedient; rebellion against the word beeing a sinn of witche craft, and transgression, moste wicked idolatry. Ther was no imagination presented or propounded with it, but that all tricks & formes and fansyes of man, wear vain and hatefull, and abominable, Psal. 119. S. For this God∣head of understanding, beeing the God of all possiblity, and to whom nothing is impos∣sible or hard, but all his wayes are secrets, and miraculous in the eyes of man, wherby, all was made and facioned, and revealed, preserved and maintened, and by perpetuall judgement, defended and saveed: how absurd then is the imploreing of sensless aide, against all rule of creation, and against the Kingdom of grace prayed for? Yf hee doth the things which no man els doth, why beleeve they him not? yf not for his own sake, yet for his works, hee ought to bee beleeved in, and trusted unto. Therfor, that they worship that wonderfull Creator, defender and preserver, the God of heaven, that made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all fountains for his infinite works of mercey, grace and compassion, in his Kingdom, by his heavenly light of wisdom, reason and knowledge, invented, disscerned and brought in frame: and not so placable Gods of their own makeing wherin against all reason and understanding the Creature is set in place of the Creator, and a man worshipeth what hee will, and contenteth himself as hee will, which is moste monstrous. For this invention yeeldeth no correction, nor amnd∣ment, and is no part of the Kingdom prayed for, seeing no obedience is due to the work of a mans own hands, no more then the father should obey the childe, or childen lay up and provide for their parents. Therfor, who so ever receiveth not the Kingdom of God, as a litle childe, for correction and obedience; hee shall not enter therinto.

The Eternall his existens is of so great extent and power and wisdom by his ministry, that it maisters all the gods, and kings, and lords of the world, Deut. 10. Ex. 34. The divers vowelling of Iehovah used but once all the psalme, intendeth but rule and might: and mercie ps. 102. repeated, according to the letters Ie∣hovah, twenty six times. Vav, a hook or crook, hee brought them out, &c. hee freed them from, &c. Lord, and worship agree. Ier. 22. Ps. 8. Mark the repetition. The three letters make quolo, his voice, or word, as Ps. 29. Deuteronomy. the Ministers are set to prais and bless and worship, 1 Cro. 16. so in the last psalme and this, the Eternall is the mighty Actor of salvation, by his grace. Mark the first and last words, and the continuall burden of the song: for a rehearsall. Gods kindenes twenty six times repeated, according to the number of 26, made up just by the letters of Jehovah. PSALM CXXXVII. IN this psalme, the Iewes shew care in pleasing God, rather than man; their Creator, Redeemer, and Inductor, rather than their captiveer and suspender: for either they will not sing at all, and hang up their harps; or if they will have them to sing, it shall be that which they have little pleasure to hear, for fear of takeing Gods name in vain, and transgressing his will, in vain rejoyceing, in their heavy season, against their harts; or makeing their enimies mery, with their sacred and good things, which God would not allow of. So that after they have made it a hard thing to sing, for people in their case, and harder to rejoyce, with holy songs of Sion: and that they did not think it meet to sing thes holy things, among such houndes, in a strange and an enimies land: yet that the name of Sion, and fame of Ierusalem, may not be forgotten by them: they take down their harps and apply their fingers, and looss their tongs from the rooffs of their mouthes; to shew, that all their joy and delight, was in Ierusalem, and not with them; all their song is nothing but a bitter prayer to God for a terrible revenge and payment upon them. That as the Edomites, incouraged to destroy Ierusalem to the ground, to the utter ruine and desolation of it: and no less could content them, and the destroying citty Babel; performd as much: that now, God would remember all their dealing, and make them happy that should require them treble, ps. 94. with a merci∣less revenge and destruction, uppon them. that ther may be no mercy to the merciless or their children, but that it may pleas God, to dash them all in peeces against the stones, with an utter confusion and destruction of them. And this, lest they should transgress the third commandment, and displeas their God, at their enemies request, to use his name unprofitabely, and deserv new punishment, and disobey his known will, and be worse beaten than before, after their return home. And becaus all pleasure is a kinde of idolatry, but the true and only worship of God; they will not pleas themselves nor their enemies, with one word of their lips, ps. 16. nor shed one drop of prais, or sa∣crifice any commendation to them at all. Construction. Quoph, to compass: Captiveers, Inthraulers, hanging, takeing. Lamed, lerning: his tong and hand shall be disused, and all cunning forgotten.

PSALM CXXXVIII. HEaring is the way to Christ, and Moses and the Prophets are the Doctors to draw men unto him, for they shall be all taught of God; and this teaching and hearing is the Sabbath work of refreshing and reviveing the miserable and dead-comfortless soule of man, ps. 113. This is the food of the congrega∣tion, the miraculous sustenance out of the Law and Testaments, that lasteth from meal to meal: with full cupbordes for ever, as ps. 144. That whereof every disciples bas∣ket, and his store is blessed with increas: and for this is the day to be kept holy and sancti∣fyed, for the presence of God and his word in it, that sanctifyeth the hearers. Which presence yf God vouchsafe not: the people are forsaken and perish, for want of his kingdom. Now that in this psalme, hee may seem to sanctifie the Sabbath, and to keep it holy: he layeth down precisely all the circumstance of his behaviour, and the worship, and keeping of it; and that most from ps. 92. that hee may seem more capa∣ble of this food and sanctifycation of the spirit: by the manner, the presence, the place the end and the reason of all. As thus, he will worship God with all his heart, he will chant him out before the gods and Angels, and judges, hee throwes himself prostrate at his temple, hee worships his Name for his loveing kindenes and his faithfullnes; and that because he hath made his promise greater than all his Name, ps. 12. Now becaus his worship is so perfect: hee desireth to bee heard in the day and time of his call∣ing, and that he would sustein, with great strength, in his minde, and releev him largely. That all the kings of the world might likewise worship God, when they have him and his wordes; and sing of his wayes and of his great glory, which are his miraculous and wonderfull woks of kindenes: also of his promiss and faithfulnes. Now becaus he is high, and beholdeth the low and the mean ones: psal. 113: and seeing hee is lofty and kenneth farr, and his word findeth men out every wher: hee prayeth now, that God would bestow his heavenly food and bread of sustenance uppon him. That as we labour all the week to rest the sabbath: so that we may be fed in the sabbath, to bee able, to labour all the week. That is, that of a man in great distress and in the midst of sorrows: he would make him a cheerfull man, and revive him; and being besieged round about with adversity, that he would lay his hand upon his enemies face, and blindefold them, and by the prosperous and dexterous right hand of his ministry, save him. And that God, who is the onely doer about him, and his kindenes is for ever: would not now forsake the works of his own hands, and creatures of his Law; and that he would never fail them with his kingdom that bringeth all things with it: but let him see the fulnes, and pleasure, and joy at his right hand, beeing his portion and cup and inheritance ps, 16.116.

It commendeth the reading of the Law, and Prophets, and for this the word saying, and Name, and hand is repeated.

PSALM CXXXIX. IN this psalme beginning with Trespass: hee sheweth by the stones of triall, in the brest∣plate of judgement, described, as ps. 149. by the law, is a mans life spanned out, and made square every way, that God is made privy to them all. If it be in position: by lyeing down, and riseing up, hee knoweth their miscarriage therein. If it bee in their travail, or their rest: hee keepeth round about all their wayes, and pryeth into every trick of them. If it be in speech or language, hee knoweth every word. Hee be∣sets them round about, they cannot go forth nor back, but his hand is uppon them: which is their conscience of sinne against the law, which he calleth a wonderfull, and a higher knowledge than he can attain unto. from the sight of which trespass and conscience of sinne: becaus ther is no escapeing: neither in heaven; nor hell, nor be∣yond sea, nor in the dark: whatsoever hee committeeth by imagination or worship: but hee is every wher with them, and alwaies in sight of them: and hee can no way out-goe him or hide from him, nay that God possessed his reins before he was born: and becaus he was fearfully hidden, and he knew that his works were wonderfull, and that hee saw his bones though they were made in secret: and that hee was set together under the earth: and his clue, and windeing: and his dayes recorded before he was born: now for this hee devides himself from the wicked, deerly, to think of God▪ as a father; and to worship and honour him for his creation, and that his cheeff and deerest and most honourable thoughts are mighty and wonderfull many of him; even above the sand of the sea in number, seeing as long as hee is awake, hee is never out of minde of him. Hee will have no fellowship with any wickednes, with such as rebell and ris against God, in fals and vain imagination, & idolatrous trespass. Ps. 119. S. And through∣ly hateth all the enemies of God, and they to him, are for deadly Enimyes. And all the sinister side for Sin, ps. 109.119. sh. and hath God on his right hand, as ps. 16. to shew his conversion, repentance, and amendment. Now seeing nothing can be hid from God, and from his all seeing presence in his Law, and conscience, but they shall bee visited to the third and fourth generation: hee prayeth to bee searcheed, and his heart and thoughts to be tryed, and known throughly, to see, yf ther bee any way or work of idolatrie or sorrowfull trespass in him. Yf ther bee, that hee would lead him the way and work of eternity, and amendment of life, and forgive him. And this is a resur∣rection which the Law performeth, by long looking into the hearts and consciences of men, to restore them and deliver them, out of the bonds of sin, and death, and hell, and the divell, and from all slavery, wherinto they are sunk by offences; yf ther be any spark of grace left in their hearts: and that they be not given over to a reprobate sens: And for this the Prophet is in hope never to see corruption, but by amendment to come to life and joy eternall. Construction. Quoph, to compass: hee is both without and within every wher, and at all times: that by any means nothing can be hid from him, or is hard to him: and this, according to Lamed, the second letter, is a wonderfull knowledge, and beyond his capacity, that he cannot be deceived therfore he prayeth God the Almighty to search his heart yf it honoured him aright: Is. 29. Ier. 16. Beeing alwayes mindefull of him, and in love with him, and in detestation of the wicked: that he would kill the wicked, and cut off his dayes, for his guiltiness: and not shorten his in the land, the word kill hath the number of the psalm, in the letters quatal, 139. Tet, clay, hee sheweth that he riseth not against his maker, Is. 29. but is alwayes a most zealous champion for him, the word vex, and rais, &c. in the Hebrw, intend no less, Hony soit qui mal y pense, hee meaneth no sorrow, therfor hee would fain bee blessed: By the old way, Ier. 6.22. Mark all the repetitions. Qualat, all the letters, to shrink, or retire, as for refuge, as miqlat, Num· 35. Is. 20. &c, ther is no sanctuary to fly from God. Deuteronomy.

Mark the repetition, and this serueth for a confession, as hee layeth him∣self open unto God. PSALM CXL. HEe sheweth heer, wherin murther consists; as in temptation: and that in injury and contention, and that in wath, and that in the heart, the tongue and the hands, and all villanous practises, and that with exceeding spight and malice, and choler: so that their hearts invent mischeeff, and they inhabit warrs, and dwell allwayes in contention: with sharp and stinging tongues, and poysoned lips like serpents. That whatsoever they say, doth by intent, maliciously kill, with words of malignity. Another part of Temptation is practise, and plots to destroy him in all his courses, to meet with him in all his wayes, wherever hee goeth, by watching oportunity to trip him and intrap him. the way hee goeth, the life hee leadeth, the work hee ex∣erciseth, or the thing hee desireth: for which the Divil hath sundry baites to make men fall, and the tempters be the haughty and proud men of the world. Now that hee see∣eth that all is injury and injustice, and the root of all, malignity of the heart, and fierce∣ness of wrath against him: hee maketh this suite to God, that hee would not fullfill the lusts of the wicked man, nor content him in his purposes, to make him proud. And as he had been alwayes his helmet, and the invironing salvation of his head: so hee prayeth that the mischeeff of their lips, and bitter curses may light uppon themselves, and that God would forbid them, and deliver him from their hands, that hee bee not tempt∣ed by them. And as they seek to slay by anger and wrath: So that the judgement of a counsell may condemn them, and men may cast coles of wrath upon them, and cast them into the fire, and hot burning embers, even into hell fire; that they never rise again, that an ill and an injurious tongue may not be established in the earth, but hunt himself to destruction; becaus hee is sure, that God will right the afflicted and needy in their sen∣tence and judgement. And the just and upright shall be preserved, to worship him and call upon his Name, and remain for ever before him, Ps. 9.14.53.149. Construction.

Ps. 9.101. wicked studies, and wicked hands, and wicked tongues, and all for warrs, and strife: such as make debate. Quom, both the letters, to stand, or rise. the prayer is, that they may neither: becaus none but just and upright men are reserved. Consider the doubling of thes words: preserv, keep, malitious, injurious, mischeeff, hart and minde, meditate, devise, warrs, tongue, lips, hands, and the relation, all wordes of justice and judgement together. The vowells of Iehovah, are turned to the vowells of Elohim, for his office of iudgement & revenge, & executeing of iustice for his servants. Hee sheweth Quoum, an insurrection, and all the manner: hee prayeth for deliverance from them, and condemnation to them, becaus in fiery malice they rise: they may be buried in fire, that they may never rise, that the iust only and upright may stand up and abide: becaus their thoughts bee on fire that they may never bee sufficed, and no water may quench them. Mark the many Mems, for water in that vers of his iudgement and his thoughts. None of refreshing, but all of affliction: that their thoughts and studyes may afflict them. Deuteronomy. It sheweth not heer the way of life, but of death, Deut. 30. the con∣trary: such as was the corruption of the old world that perish, and of the wrath of the serpent, to be ruined, the way of sorrow, as in the last psalme; which is killing by temptation and vexation: a cursed way. His prayer serveth for a confes∣sion.
PSALM CXLI. AS sweet meats have sower sawe: so ther bee no dishes so dainty as temptati∣ons; and no such baites as rankest poyson. Now seeing, in this Psalme, that their bones, are not onely brokeen with temptation, but lye at the graves side, as chips and clifts by the saw-pits-side, of the hewer and squareer: and hee is in prayer while they are in their mischeeff: and that hee calleth upon God and his eyes are ever bent unto him: and hee trusteth in him: hee now prayeth, that hee would with speed, hearken unto him, and take his prayer for an evening sacrifice, Eph. 4. And seeing the tong is that unrulely evill of provocation, and that which setteth all the world on fire, as in the last Psalme, and is so forward and so full of poyson: that God would lock up his lips, and guard his mouth, that nothing of temptation or ill matter pass by them, from his hart, in the way of wickednes or slander; & that their deinty messes intice him not, nor bewitch him to transgress; but that the just man should instruct him in love, though it bee with stripes, rather to bring the pretious oyle of the Kingdom of heaven upon his head, and crown him with celestiall understanding, of joy above his fellows, as Psal. 45. That their defenders and deliverers may not have a word to say, but bee strooken as silent and dumb as a stone, to heaken to the sweetnes of his wordes, which is, for the Iustice, and equity of the matter, like sine pom-granats and aples of gold, that the righteousnes of the Pists lips might ring: that though his bones lye so nigh the pitt: yet becaus his trust is onely in God, and his eyes are allwayes upon him: that hee would not strip him out of all, and overthrow him, and deprive him by it, but that hee would keep him out of all the snares of the workers of greeff and molestation, and temptati∣on, which they lay for him; which are every howre, as an open pitt ready to swallow him: and that the wicked, may justly fall into the meashes of their own nets, and into the pitt of their own makeing. While hee escapeth, and hath his issue out of temptation, and is delivered. Construction. Quoph, to compass: or stand or sett about: as a watch and ward to his mouth. 2. Cor. 11. or deinty meates.

And should deserv to bee stoneed, Ezech. 16.22. Lev. 18. Is. 37. Deut. 7.19. hee prayeth to bee righted: though hee feel it, and smart for it. And this from Aleph, to instruct. That his wits bee not confounded by her, nor his strength ill bestowed, beeing so nighe perishing. Hee prayeth, their judges or Gods may bee smitten, &c. so hee inten∣deth the destruction of all their trust, by the pureitey of his prayers, and Gods accep∣tance of him. Hee sacrifyeeth by prayer, as Psal. 50. all is for Instruction, against In∣struction. Mark the number of repetitions. Deuteronomy. Hee sheweth another way of declineing, and missing of Eternall life, as Math. 19. by spirituall adultery. And as hee handleth yet the word and name of God: so heer hee termeth their Gods and Idols, judges, as Psal. 82. and for the certainty heerof, is Jehovah, made Iehovih, and vowelled like Elohim, which is judgement, that property of God. His calling and prayer serveth for confession and recitation, as Psal. 50.91. PSALM CXLII. THer is no such theeft as to take men from the service and Altar of God, Psal. 26. Now to bee applyed properly to this Psalme: seeing all persecution is theeft and
robbery: and becaus David was now chaseed by Saul into the Cave, Psal. 143. hee findes a way of excerciseing his Kingdom of patience, as yf hee should say: bless∣ed are they when men revile them, and persecute them; to steal away their good name, or rob them of their liberty or substance: speaking all manner of evill against them, for Gods sake falsly, Math. 5. for then great is their reward: and not to re∣sist evil. And this is that which David waiteth for, for his singular patience and suffer∣ing, not seeking any revenge, or restitution, or amends: and hee will not seek to mend his portion in this life, but that God and his relye, and his Kingdom shall bee all circum∣scription therof, to wall him in, and confine him, and content him. And thus hee sticketh fast to the mercy of God, because all kingdom is his, and serveth for a reproof for Saul, and a comfort for himself. Therfor beeing now in a disperate case and in great distress: that his spirit fainted, and that hee was intrapped in all his courses: and snares layed for him, which way soever hee went: and that ther is no refuge at his right hand to be found: or any man at all to distinguish or entertaine him: or any bosom to receive him: or to disscern or help him: or that careeth for him, to save his life: hee now cryeth unto God, and beseecheth him, makeing him his portion, and setting him att his right hand, as Psal. 16. that considering his great poverty of distress, hee would hear∣ken to him & deliver him from his persecutors, seeing they were too strong for him: & that hee would inlarge him, and make it a wonderfull and bountifull deliverance, that beeing shod with the Gospell, hee may worship his name, with the just ones, for so great a reward upon him. Construction. Quoph, to compass: as distress, seege and want of succour about him, naked in the cave, Psal. 141.

And the whole Psalme is indicative. Hee bewrayes all to God, that they should not steal his servant, Deut. 24. Is. 42. willed Psal. 50.91. Mark the repitition. Voice, cry, Eternall, to thee, before him, life or person. So powre out, tell, look, see, acquaintance, present or absent, worship, &c. with the contrary: hide, overcom or faint, hold. &c. Deuteronomy. Hee, confesseth his wonderfull distress: and prayeth for deliverance, that they make not a prey of Gods servant. That hee may have matter to worship his name, for his bounty, which serveth for a memoriall of his mercy, and way of life in his word, which is in crossing of theeft. PSALM. CXLIII. HEe prayeth, not to be called to account or strictly examined, lest hee bee con∣demned, of the breach of this commandement. For the keeping of which: hee propoundeth to himself, to depart from evill, as Psal. 37. and that as far as hee can goe, which hee makeeth the resisting of the Divill, that hee may fly from him. And sheweth that in all his perplexity and adversity, beeing chased by his Enimy into the ground, as Ps. 142. and to obscure dwelling, like as yf hee were dead: & feeling faintnes of hart, and all his courage and spirit spent: and his hart by guiltynes wasteed and shivered within him: that hee recedes now, as far from fals testimony against his neighbour, as hee can devise: which is, to the rememebrance of the ancient kindenes, and wonderfull works of Gods handes, as Psal. 118. and to a meditation, witnes and true testimony of them, and to tell of them: to study the Scriptures for his comfort and to keep them in minde, and bear record of them; which is the opposition, which hee propoundeth, and this with a great longing. Therfor, that now, when his spirit is so nigh spent, and himself almoste at the grave with greeff: and that hee trust∣steth
in God, and maketh all his Kingdom the righteousnes therof: hee now requesteth that hee would hear him, and answer him therwith, and whisper him in the ear by his word, and teach him the way of deliverance from his Enimyes, and to doo his will. And because hee is his servant: that by his good spirit, God wil still lead him in plain ground, and by this meanes bring him out of all distress and destroy his Enimyes, and for his names sake revive him: and that hee would graunt him this kindenes with speed, & not to hide his face, and the understanding of his law from him, and confound him. This power is such as Christ gave to his Disciples over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all disseases, that is, to purge and rid men of all ill conversation of life, by their doctrine, speaking by the spirit of the father, the word, and addressing them to the keeping of the commandements; which is the power of the Kingdom and government here prayed for. Yf I cast out divills by the spirit of God: then is the Kingdom of God com unto you. Construction. Quoph, to compass: by the words distress, and torment, and love∣ing kindenes, and supplication, &c.

Deuteronomy. Hee sheweth himself to bee a sound profession before God, and diligent in all the imployment of godlynes, and prayeth for the fruit and testimony of the way of godlynes, and the liveing way and everlasting, life: by finding the mercyes & favour of God, upon him, by his instruction; as mens works witnes of them, Ioh. 5.8.10. and this for a confession also, to cross fals testimony. PSALM. CXLIV. BEcaus his servants life and his hous is so greedily coveted: hee prayeth God to take it to hart, and with a furious judgement, to descend to deliver him from thes uncircumcised tonges and handes, of the seperate ones, and aliens from his glory or welth, called great waters. That according to Psal. 92. hee may set the ten stringed violl to work with a new song; a song of judgement and grace, as Psal. 101. by saveing of Kings, by his servant, from the hurtfull sword, according to his precept: thou shall not covet his servant, &c. that seeing the commandements bee out, hee may beginn, with the Petaroth of judgements, laws and statutes of condemnation and justifi∣cation: the Vrim and Thummim, or the two hills, and brefts of the Priests. That so great a glory of Israel and the Church should not be extinguished. That all estates might have their full utility, plenty and ripenes: that their sonns and daughters may bee safe, without any ravenous or untimely covet or stealth, to grow up wel educateed, and neatly, and gloriously facioned and edifyed in their youth, in the fear of God. And this for his man-servant, and his maid servant, becus Gods servants are his Children. That their cup-bord may never bee empty, and that their sheep may bee infinit many, increased in their streets, & the ox and the ass, with their dayly burdens of wealth and store: without any freebooting or robbery or covetous filching, or wrangling, or violent stealing, or caus of out cry among them. This hee counteth a moste glorious and happy estate of all, with whom it thus fares, and whos God and neighbour the everlasting is: against whom ther is no prevailing; and when the childe and hous-hold servants of God, doo flowrish, and are well replenished, like Temples of holynes. So as men are comman∣ded
to doo good, especially to them of the hous-hold of faith: so heer▪ the strictest for∣bidding of Covet is, that the Godly may injoy their quiet and their labours, as Ps. 128. whithout deprivation or disturbance, that God would bow the heavens and decline the Scriptures and touch the mountaines and Kingdomes and nations therwith, that they may smoke again, with the condemnation and firey judgement of them. And that hee would blast them and dispers them, and with terrible arrowes of his lightning destroy the Churches Enimyes. And deliver his servantes from them. Becaus all means of de∣liverance, and way of salvation is his, to rely on, the shield of faith. That hee take∣eth notice of the Church and Ark of Noah under the person of Adam, whos dayes, are 930. And keepeth such computation of it, as in the word Tsel, 930, a shadow moste like to vanity, and this agreeth with the posterity of the just in the termn Shalom, 930 yeers, Psal. 37.

TO sum up the Lords prayer and petition, which holdeth out after the com∣mandements; in one word: which is the Kingdom of heaven and power and glory therof. Hee sheweth, becaus the greatnes of God far passeth all ma∣gnificence and his estimablenes far beyond all examination, Ps. 50. For his pitty and compassion, for his long patience, and great benignity & kindenes: for his goodnes and mercyes to and over all his works: because his Kingdom and power and glory is eternall: for susteining them that are falling and in decay, and setting upright them that are declineing, and giving all things their meat in due time: and liberally and freely, and bountifully satisfyeing all living creatures with his open handes. For his justice in all his wayes, and kindenes upon all his creatures of his Church: for his neernes to them that call upon him faithfully, by performing what soever they request, and hearing them and saveing them: and destroying all the wicked, as Psal. 92. That therfor, seeing this Kingdom is of this kinde of heavenly operation, & not of the world; which is the seed of the word sowen in the hart of man to govern him; hee now as in the conclusions of all the rest of the books, exalteth greatly this God and King of his, and blesseth his name, and the calling upon him for ever and ever. Which exaltation, and hallowing of his Name is a new work after the petition is ended, to finish all, which shall last for ever, as Psal. 111, for makeing him sundry wayes ripe in the word of God, and cherishing him therwith, for setting him in the doctrine that lasteth for ever and ever. That ever ge∣neration

PSALM CXLVI. IN this psalme hee considereth that hee will make his confidence sure, and then spend all his life in prais and psalmes unto his God, as ps. 92. Therfor takeing away all vanity of worldly confidence; hee seeketh the heavenly happines therof; that the God of Sion and the Church, and his righteousnes is to reign for ever, and to bee exalted and praised. Therfor heer, as ps. 118. hee willeth not to trust in unchari∣ritable princes or any human men, which know not the high wisdom of God, nor the depth of the mysterie therof, determined for the glory and safety of the Church, which have no salvation or help in them; that by and by consume and turn to earth, as soon as the breath is out of them, and in the same day, all their estimation and reputation and thoughts are at an end and perish: hee now sheweth a more than fleshly revelation, to them that love him, that is the godly, of a sound rock to build upon; that spirituall things must be set to spirituall things, our faith in spirituall charity, becaus God is spi∣rit, and this a healing faith: hee commendeth greatly the beleeff in God and his word, the Creator, maintainer and restorer of all things, and the happines of him that repose∣eth all his help and hope in him, setting him forth by his heavenly properties. Tell Iohn what things ye have seen, a preserver of truth, and keeper of faithfullnes for ever, a Releever of the oppressed, and a graunter of his request, and a righter of their caus, a feeder of them that hunger for him, a resolver of all that be tyed in ignorance and doubt or haesitation, a giver of sight and knowledge to the blinde and unlearned, and a streighter and director of them that bee of a wrong and a crooked opinion, or lame and declining in their understanding, and a lover of them that be right, and most charitablely preserveth strangers with hospitality, and mainteineth parents for orphans, and husbands for widdowes, as ps. 68. & a perverter & crosser of all the wayes, & works of wicked men, as ps. 1, that they may perpetually bee seen to perish, and com to

PSALM CXLVII. BEcause Gods prais is so desireable a thing, and so comely: and God so good and so pleasant: for building Ierusalem, as a nest for his Saints, and a Synagogue of all the Church. to salve all their dispersion, & cure their broken hars, & binde∣ing up their grief; keeping the number of all his starts & ministers, in the book of life, and makeing a catalogue of them: becaus their lord is of great power, and of in∣finite understanding, continueing the lowly: makeing the weakest to last longest, and humbling the wicked, and proudest and strongest to the ground: for covering the heavens of understanding with parabolicall clouds, and makeing lerning to rain on the earth, and grass and food for all creatures that call for it: and hath his onely delight and pleasure in them that fear him and wait for his kindenes, and not in mans desires or humane delights, as ps. 37.33. Because hee hath made their citty, strong gates of salva∣tion, by the doctrine of the Prophets to keep it, as ps. 127 and blessed their children with the comfort of the word of God, within it, as ps. 28.29. and peace and plenty of fine wheat flower, in all her borders; sending out his word and servants, that most speedily runn through the whole land; that when a winter season of frost and snow, and hard clumpers of ice are cast out, to possess the intractable hearts of men, to cor∣rect the stubbornnes of man, and to mollifie their hardnes, and to make them more fruitfull, and to add strength unto them for increas and multiplication of them: hee by and by, sendeth his spirit, the south and warm winde of his word, and thaweth them, and they yeeld doctrine, that no other nation should know his judgements: which follow properly after the commandements, as just payments for the breaches of them, and a perfect recompens of all mens works, giveing them waight for waight, and mea∣sure for measure. Therfor according to ps. 92. hee willeth to prais God, and chant out his prais. and becaus his wisdom in this psalm is so infinitely set out, as his speciall property: heer hee ascribeth that unto him, and willeth, that they sing psalms to him with thanks, on the harp, ps. 92, and that Ierusalem and Sion above all, should com∣mend and prais him: for their so great benefit for the service of him, ps. 92. Further∣more, haveing done with the preacher, hee commeth now to the sermon, which is, righteosnes, and this is the content of all the Scriptures and summ of them, the word of God and sword of the spirit, which hee handleth, ps. 141· Therfor, in this psalm hee reckoneeth the books of the bible, as Ovid reckoned the books of Virgill, Am.

So that the whole Scriptures and scope of them, and the iudgements and prescripts and com∣fort and salvation, beeing onely known unto the Church: all the world could not com∣pare with them, as ps. 47.

IN this psalm, because Gods words and commandments have formed them, and made them that they are; hee willeth that of right, and by good reason, they should all creatures in the world, do his commandment and set forth his prais, out of heaven in the highest, as ps. 92. and that hee willeth his angels and ministers of his church, and all the army of them, beeing the whole hoste of heaven, and hea∣venly sanctuary to doo.

To tell this judgement, was the work of all the Prophets untill Iohn, and then, this kingdom was take∣en by violence and force, and men pressed unto it. So that now, after all places of invention, hee now commeth to a collection or syllogizeing of the whole work by the judiciall part, for ever unconfuteable. That God that made the world, should judge the same: by sound confirmations, consequences, and proprietyes and rightes and lawes, according to the power of his name Eloah, and Elohim, of Alah to swear, to doo judgement and justice and right: and to perform the oath which hee sware, to bee a perpetuall redemption to his Church, Psal. 110. and a glory to his people Israel, with a reprooveing of all injury and injustice of the reprobate. So the end is com, the end is com (as the Prophet sayth) and Satan with all his perversity and adversity, with all his malice and falshood, and subdolity and treachery is judged, and the day of wrath is com, and hee is discovered and overcom, and cast down and con∣demned for his cotinuall persecution of the Church. For this benefit, they are greatly to prais his name, and sing Psalmes to him in honour of his name, & make invocation ther∣upon, that hath don all for them: for reprooving confuteing and tormenting, all their adversaryes, and cheeff of them, and that the Saintes for this peace should leap up in their beds for joy, and make a glorious exaltation, and triumph, for this great day of victory and salvation, with accents of exaltations and highe prayses of God, and choise songs in their throats: and a sharp sword in their handes lyeing by them, to shew their meanes of deliverance and courage and valour and preparation of the word of God, their defendour, that whispers in the ears of all men and warneth them. Heerto be∣long
the fignified vertues in the apparell of the Priesthood, that they may bee happy whom the Eternall, the God of justice chargeeth not with iniquity, Psal. 32. So that now it is in vain for to strive, as Psal. 2. or the Kings and heades, to think of casting away the cordes, and bandes of their yokes of subjection to the Church: for hee hath appointed his King over Sion, and his horn and his anoynted, and his prais, as Psal. 141.92.86. God hath still favoured them that fear him, and planted a gardine of pleasure for them, that hee hath begotten: a paradise of safety and salvation for his children, and hath appointed his Angels and Ministers to pitch about them, as. Ps. 34. King of Iacob, Is. 41.43. Ier. 8. to keep and preserve the way of righteousnes in this life, the tree of their lives in holy∣nes. And with this grace hath God clotheed his saintes while their Enimyes, are judged, as ps. 2.92.79. and for this ornament and Paradise and comly weed of salvation, the skinn that covereth all nakednes, that hath no cloud of shames upon it, no spot or wrinkle in it, Eph. 5. That his saintes should prais him, in their congregation, with a sonet of all confidence, as ps. 118. Construction. Quoph, to compass, or inviron, as the gratious ones, Israel and the children of Sion, in praising of him. with Ioy in the holy Ghost, another part of the Kingdom, ps: 145. in commendation of Iah, their King and makeer, Is. 53.22.41.43. Ier. 8. ps. 29.48.24. by the spirituall and gutturall sound and prononciation of Ieho∣vah, psal. 115.135. For every Law must have a King. Jehovah, calamity, Jad, a hand & He, the coactive conjugation of Hiphil, working salvation and revenge. Mark the words gratious ones and saintes: maker, work, and fullfill. Mem, waters: people, heathen, nations, Kings, Nobles, &c. The calamity and captivity of them, and cutting them off, and wearying of them according to Quamat, to bee wearyed or dissolved, Iob 16.22. Jah, is intimated. By exaltations in his Throat, is the aspiration of He, meant, beeing a gutturall letter: so is Iod, signifyed by sword for hand, ps. 17. And thus hee is taken for maker, King and God and Almighty and Revenger. So they have the name of God, or God in their throat and in their hand. Mark all the words of Ioy, re∣joyceing and prais according to it, and the repetition upon all, Is. 45. Deuteronomy. By all kindes of rejoyceing for their salvation, the glory of their King∣dom 145.111.112.45. for his notable acts, and the majesty of his name Jah, in them, in makeing and governing and saveing of them, in beeing kinde to the kinde, &c. as psal. 18. And this prais is also a good confession or rehearsall of his grace, in the other Psalme, his works and frame of the world set him out, & in this, his gratious ones (his Ministry) must bless him, ps. 145. with all their might and all the wayes they can. PSALM CL. THe things in this Psalme to bee set out, are the everlasting strength of God, by his judgement and justice, and his holynes, and his great stature and estimation, by his victories and salvation, and his great prevailing and overcomming, by the Law, and that in his sanctuary, and in the highth of his hollynes and all solemni∣tyes. And for creation and conservation, that all things breathing should again and again prais him, and evermore extoll him, & glorifye him world without end, with many an Amen, and many a hallelujah, and, God be praised, for the same. The voice of God in his sanctuary requireeth great strength and glory, as psal. 29. and great confidence in the firmament of the heavens therof, ps. 68. And because his word and all that is spo∣keen in his Temple is glorious: hee must have a lofty and a bold utterance and a loud pronuntiation even in the skyes for the syncerity therof. Because the scriptures bee the creators of the children of God: so they bee their Elders, their father and autho∣rityes and witnesses, to judge all men quick and dead and by their testimony, to disscide all strife and contention. So hee that speaketh from hence, speaketh soundly, and ther is no replyeing against the authority heerof. This prooff and testimony putteth the Di∣vil to silence, and this of great validity in judgement. Becaus it belongeth to all partes of
the sylogisme, to proov or reproov the same. So that the commandements beeing po∣sitive, and the Cases divers that rise from thence, and all condemnation is by judgement: so in all cases testimony must bring foorth truthe; and truthe an upright sentence which in this psalme, for an approbation of all men: hee willeth the whole Church to confirm, and to justify all that is spoken, and that in a high majesty in his Church, and that they should prais God in a firmament of faith and confidence, as the faithfull and true witness, Amen. That they should prais him for his victoryes, dignity and excel∣lence and for his great magnificence and worthynes, honour and estimation, as ps. 146. And for testimony: that hee should protest and witness the same, and prais him with all kinde of musique, yee the lowdest: and willeth, that every breath and gasp and aspira∣tion should testifye the judgement and applaude it and sing prais of God. Becaus by this, the way of God and all just men, is manifest and plain, as ps. 1. Ther is no witnes like the father, and a testimony of the Scripture is a good demonstration. So to conclude the strength of the Law, and lawes and judgements therof with judgement, as ps. 99. and all the praises of Israel with prais: hee hath thus finished the book for the Church, that ther is salvation for the people of God, ps. 3. and that by the Law, psal. 4. and Kingdom of righteousnes, ps. 5. with this high glory to God above the heavens, ps. 8. and worship over all the earth. Now is the wrath of God, upon the gentiles com, and the time of the dead, that they should bee judged, ps. 145.149. and that hee should give reward to his servants the Prophers, and to the sainctes and them that fear his name, to small and great, and should destroy them that destroy the earth, Deut. 28. Apoc. 11. and all the mystery of God and of the Law, and of the Prophets, revealed and finished, Apoc. 10. Construction. Quopb, to compass, is heer meant by praising, and assemblies about him, as the last declareed the person: ps. 48. the Church is the element of his strength, and principall dwelling of the Law and word of God, by the preaching and extolling of it; ps. 29. compared to the sunn as ps. 19. for visiting all men with all kinde of lustre and grace about them, as Saul; Act. 9. as the mighty king, according to the power and greatnes of him, being possessor and conquerour of heaven and earth Gen. 14. by the letters Quen, a nest, seat, or possession, Ier. 22. psal. 84. of Quanah, to get or obtein, or conquer. That his name Iah, may spring and grow in the sunn, as psal. 72. according to the letter Nun, or N. to grow, for his publike prais by musick, full of as∣piration to express his name Iah, exceeding triumph for his exceeding greatnes. Hu, is a name of God from Iehovah, as well as for his excellence, and onelynes. In respect wher∣of the term is heer so oft repeated and affixed to praise. to wit, 11 times, the number of the two letters. hee is praised in respect of his onelynes wher, and wherin, and in mea∣sure, also wherwith: and those bee the instruments iust 11. Deuteronomy. A hundred and fifty dayes the flood increased: so have the praises of God, who sitteth upon the flood, as ps. 22. Hee is king for ever, and the strength of his Law is infinit, that hee giveth to his people, and feedeth them withall, ps. 28.29. that they should for ever prais him, and ever comment upon him and confess his wonderfull kindenes to the children of men. Praised bee God. FINIS.
