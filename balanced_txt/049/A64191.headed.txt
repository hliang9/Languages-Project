OXFORD BESIEDGED, Surprized, Taken, and Pittifully Entred, on Munday the second of Iune last, 1645. by the Valiant Forces of the London and West∣minster Parliament. LOndon and Westminster, (though neither of you are my Native or Naturall Mother, yet) I was borne in Glocester, a City that hath stood to it in our Loyall and obedient Warres against the King, not much inferiour for Parliamentall obedience or Publique Faith and Confidence to you, as hath been obstinately manifested. But leaving Glo∣cester, with her Massy zeale and valour, I returne my loving Remembrance to London, who hath been, and is the inexhau∣stible Magazine for Men, Mony, and Maintenance, for the sup∣portation of those durable, famous and lasting Warres against the King, (which the Cavaliering and Malignant Party calls Rebellion) and which we have causes to call, entitle, nomi∣nate, and acknowledge to be the Holy Cause. And as our Armies have with unexpected successe, been Horrible, Terrible, Dreadfull, Fearefull, Victorious, and Invin∣cible, and have forraged through England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Coventry, and Canterbury, yet that stiffeneck'd Gene∣ration and People of Oxford, have (till now) stood out in Re∣bellious opposition against us; for that Academy and City, have ever since these distracted and disturbant times, been the Treasury of Refractory obstinacy, and the Store-house of our Mischiefes; whom to suppresse and bring into order and conformity, our Almighty Parliament hath sought by all fa∣vourable meanes, and by most perswasive Exhortations from the Presse and Pulpits, there hath been nothing by us negle∣cted,
that might reforme them. But finding their obduracy immoveable, their inveteracy implacable, and their reducancy impossible; we (out of a Christian care of the future prospe∣rity of that Renowned well-spring and Fountaine of Lear∣ning) much against our pious Inclinations, were inforced to surround it with our Potent and unresistible Forces of hostility, twice in two severall yeares. In two monthes of May, we have given them two gentle and friendly Visitations (viz. 1644, and 1645.) and we al∣waies used the most submissive way of Summoning His Maje∣sty and that stubborne City to our obedience. What a faire warning we gave them the first yeare, is not unknowne, and how fairly we came of and on, we have cause to remember, for two great Generalls and Armies did onely face them, as an Instruction for them to avoyd their further desolation and ca∣lamity. But seeing that gentle and mollifying Cataplasmes and Pultisses would not serve to soften the Corrodency of their A∣postumated Inveteracy, we have now (about the latter end of this last May) in the Whitsun week, vouchsafed to lance her Malignant maladies, and by incision and occission, to let out her malevolent and contagious Corruptions. To which end and purpose, our (potent, powerfull, perpe∣tuall and pittifull) Parliament, begirt and swathed that contu∣matious City with a strong Swaddle band of Warre, with foure severall Armies, which being conjoyned into one, with a Quadrapliciticall Vnity, under the conduction of such a Messe (or Murnivall) of Martiall Commanders, that the like (or bra∣ver) Heroes, never issued from the Loynes of Mars & Belona, amongst whom the most Excellent, Expert, Exact, and Exqui∣site Souldier, Sir Thomasius Fairfax, was Commander in chiefe, being the admired Agamemnon of our Host, and the only chosen, pick'd, or cul'd man amongst men most worthy to be a Generall Generalissimo. Secondly, the Couragious and Treshault Treshnoble Cromwell, shew'd himselfe like a bla∣zing fiery Commet, full of combustible Valour, and Subitory Expedition. Thirdly, that Impe of Prowesse, the Magazine and Arcenall of Armes and Military discipline, the never daun∣ted
and dreadfull Skippon, appear'd like the Magnanimous Achilles, with his most unmatchable multitude of Mirmidons. Fourthly and lastly, (but neither last or least in worth) was the Illustrious Bold Browne, in whose Braine, the Art of Armes is Pyled, and in whose Breast, Honour is Billited, he most Terri∣bly, Fearfully, drew his Trenchant Sword, wherewith he chop'd in sunder the Faggot-Bond of his fury, insomuch that his flaming Valour (like a burning Bavin) appear'd most Re∣fulgently perspicuous to the besiedged Oxonians. These foure Generalls (drawne in their particulars) were Quarter'd in the Villages that doe Verge, Fringe, or Girdle the City, namely Kennington, South Hinkesey, West Hinkesey, Botley, Witeham, Wolvercot, Marson, Hedington, Sampford, Ifley, &c. By which meanes it was so strongly Block'd up, that the Garrisons Forces and Inhabitants began to look thin upon the matter, for they were so unprovided, and unprepared to endure a Siedge, that within five dayes we brought them to such a hard strait, that Wheat was mounted to the price of 4s. the Bushell, Butter and Cheese at 6d and 3d the pound, Milke at a penny the quart, but 9 or ten Egges a groat, Radishes a halfe penny the bunch, a Iugge of Beere 2d, Beefe and other Flesh so scarce, that none was to be had amongst them (without credit or ready mony.) In this extremity, we perceived they were unable to hold out long, therefore our Valiant Commanders, (like the foure Windes) assaulted them at their foure severall Portes, His Excellency, play'd the part of Boreas, and Blustred Impetu∣ously at the North; Browne with his Brave Bold Boyes Blew Boystrously like Auster at the South; Cromwell Acted the part of Eurus with untireable Snuffing, Puffing, and Huffing at the East; and Skippon (like a second Scipio) Rag'd most Tempesti∣lentially (like Zephyrus) on the West. Thus on all sides, Parts and Portes was Oxford Beleaguerd, without and within every House, Lane, and Street, was full of Horror, Terror, Trembling like Hills. There you might behold a Woman quaking like a Custard before an Alderman, and in another place another sha∣king like an Oven; there was carelesse security in sundry and severall shapes and noyses, some halfe, and some whole drunk,
some piping and whiffing, some Riming and singing, some watching and guarding, (not at all regarding either us or any thing that we could doe to them) as may appeare by a mad fellow that wrote these Verses in a jeering Contempt of us and our Forces. For Browne, for Skippon, Cromwell, and for Fairfax, Wee have a well string'd Instrument at Cairfax, And that if they doe but their Worke by halves, The Parliament would Hang em up like Calves. Some of them said, that our Armies should not offend the Par∣liament so farre, as to doe their worke by halves, or to doe halfe the worke they were sent about; thus continued this hotch potch, mingle mangle galleymawfrey of variable opinions and humourous expressions, for the space of seven daies and nine nights, with an afternoone or two; Our Cannons with perpe∣tuall Battry having disgorg'd 6789 shot, our Horse, Carbines, and our innumerable Foot environ'd them round, with groves, thickets, and woods of Pikes, our Mukets, Petronells, and Pi∣stolls, breathing flames, and spitting death and destruction. Amongst and amidst these Rough Robustious salutations, and Mortall Monumentall mortuary greetings, one of our Cannons (being) discharged or fired at Random, from his Excellencies Quarter at Marson, flew by chance over Saint Iohns Colledge, and most strangely wheel'd about on the left hand, hard by the Crosse and weathercock on Saint Maries Steeple; and passing in post hast to Christ-Church, it broke a corner of a window in the great Quadrangle, and from thence it mounted, and took the great Lanthorne on the top of the Hall, which never fell to ground till it drop'd into Abington market place; just in the same Pavement whereon the Idolatrous Crosse stood, that was Piously overthrowne on the 31 of May, 1644. (much about the month, day, and time of the yeare as the aforesaid shot fell into Christ-Church) by the most Victorious and Vanquish'd, the Renowned and Nobly slighted, the Conquer'd Conqueror, Sir William Waller; the aforesaid Lanthorne, being now in the tuition of the Valiant Colonell Browne, who hath it as a Re∣ward of his Noble services, and is determined to keep it till he
dyes, and afterwards it is to be hang'd up (as a Trophey) over his Tombe, for a Monumentall Remembrance to Posterity, of his Valour and Victories. But to returne to the Siege againe; The Reader must under∣stand, that our Parliament are so happy to have such Generalls and Commanders as are in their Valours, not only invincible, but invisible also. The Canoneers and Gunners had the Art to discharge many hundreds of their Ordnance, and no fire or Bullet to be seen, nor Report of any Gun heard. For of all the great numbers of shot (before specified) there were very few of them came to the knowledge of the Besieged; insomuch that they were uncapable of perceiving any danger they were in. This Rare hidden Art was first invented by an Italian, whom they called Doctor Iackaneico, he was an Aegyptian witch, (or a cunning man) in the Raigne of Ptolomy Ever∣getes King of Aegypt. By the Command of Sir Tom (his Excellency I meane) there was an Artificiall Naturall Geometricall Bridge, made over the River Charwell, about a mile from Oxford (North East and by Westward) what good service that Bridge did it is impertinent, and not much materiall to speak of; But this is certaine, that the month of May, ending on the 31, which being Saturday, fell out luckily to be the latter end of the week, the Sunday following proved to be the first day of Iune, so that (by consequence) Monday was the next day after; on which Monday morning, we had the happinesse to gaine a glorious Victory. On that day, (that memorable, remarkable, honou∣rable, dainty delicate day) our Forces ascended to the top (or altitude) of Mount Hedinton (vulgarly called Hedinton Hill) but for that day, and on that Hill (to which Hill, Pinda, Ossa, Olympus, Parnassus, Gadds Hill, Shotover, and Shuters Hill, shall hereafter strike saile) our prosperous Parliamentonyans, inclosed, encompassed, environ'd, enwrapped, envelloped (or what the Reader meanes to tearme it) the whole Body, or Bodies of the Malignants, we fought Valiantly, they fell Vio∣lently, some dead, some kill'd, some slaine, some hurt, some wounded, some fled, some ran away, some escap'd, some taken
Prisoners, some put into Bondage, some thrust into Thraldom, and some carried into Captivity, so that in lesse time then halfe an howre, the mutability of fickle fortune was apparent, by a suddain turne of her foure square-Round wheele, for beyond all expectation, when the Enemy was singing scurvy Songs, & jeering with intollerable abusive Language and gesture, at the Sacred Persons and Honours of those whom they have former∣ly sworne to obey with Allegiance and Loyalty. Then at that Time, even then, betwixt the howres of two and three in the morning, we fell upon them Pell mell, Helter skelter, where in a moment 40 or 50 fell, to seek their habitation in another world, many were sore wounded; and having thus won the Field, we presently won Oxford, we entred without Resi∣stants at the East, by Saint Clements, we Conquer'd Maudlin (or Magdalen Colledge) with a bare Summons, we march'd Triumphantly to Cairfax, (and leaving the Gallowse on our right hand) we with force or perforce entred and surpriz'd the Castle, we staid in the Castle three dayes, in all which time our Generalls were so Nobly pittifull, and our other Commanders, Officers, and Souldiers so mercifully mannerly, that we neither did the Towne any harme, or Plunder'd the people of anything (except Victualls) but whatsoever we had was freely given to us, nor did any of us so much as give the Oxford folke so much as a hard word, nor troubled them to lye in any of their Beds or foule sheets, or any linnen; and was not this a mercifull Victory? All this was done by lesse then 150 Parliament Souldiers, in so small or little a time, that it must ever be with Thankfulnesse remembred, and it is not to be doubted, but London and Westminster will expresse their joyfull gratitude, with Bells, Bonefires, and an holy publique Thankesgiving. To conclude, I have an humble desire (on Request) to all Valiant men of our Parliament Armies, which is, That they will stoutly, stiffely, and desperately stand and persevere in the Cause, you know that many of us, could never have gotten such Estates by our Trades, as we have purchased by this Trade of Warre; it is not Loyalty and Allegiance, that will preferre
a Tinker to the Estate of a Commander, it is not that beggerly Thing call'd Honesty, nor that despised fancy of Learning, will bring a man to Promotion, Conscience is a Toye, it will never make a Cobler a Preacher, or a Wood-monger a Sergeant Major Generall, or Colonell; we are now Grammar'd in our Noble Actions, and a Peace would put very many of us back againe to our Horne-bookes; a just and lawfull Peace would cause the King to have His Owne againe, and every man to have his Right; a Peace would restore the Protestant Religion to it's Pristine Purity; and then what will become of our Zealous new Directorie, for a Peace will bring in againe, the contemned Booke of Common Prayer; and finally a Peace would make Thousands of us to surrender so much Pillage and Plunder to the Right owners, that we should be like (Aesops Crow) poore naked Rogues, when every Bird had his fether from us; Let our Conquests encourage us, let our hopes spurre us forward, let our surprize of Oxford, fill our Vei with Valour, and let the 24 Tinkers of Banbury, be our Presidents, who (for joy of our Oxonian Victory) have newly Brac'd their Kettle Drummes for the Entertainment of the Lord Say thither, which they will Seale with their Blood. Let our Preachers Revile, let our Pamphlet writers Raile, let Mercurius Britannicus Jeere and flourish, let Booker, Ny, and Lyly, lye on, let us Fight for wealth, and Run away for advantage, wee have a Parliament to protect us, and theres an end. POSTCRIPT, or an old said saw of the Malignants. Wise men Labour, Good men Grieve, Knaves invent, and Fooles believe, Then helpe us Lord, and stand unto us, Or Knaves and Fooles will quite undoe us. FINIS.
