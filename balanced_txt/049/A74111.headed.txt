blazon of the City of London By the Major. WHereas by a Precept of the 29. of August last, which was awarded in pursuance of an Order of Common-councell that day made, it was required that the Collectors for the Arrears of the Assessments for the Army under the command of the Lord Fairfax, with the assistance of the Deputy and Common-councell-men of every Ward should use their uttermost endevours for the Collecting of the said Arrears, and upon Saturday last should pay all moneys in their hands to the Treasurers for that purpose; And that on this day return should be made to the Grand Committee for the said Arrears of the Names of all persons that should then owe any money upon the said Assessments, and the summes so by them owing, in such manner, and to such purpose as in the said Precept and Order is expressed: Now forasmuch as the said Deputies and Common-councell-men (as I am informed) did make relation to the said Grand Committee of some proceedings upon the said Precept towards the getting in of the said Arrears; and that more would be done therein, if some further time were given, whereupon it was thought fit by the said Grand Committee, That the said Collectors, Deputies, and Common-councell-men should have time untill Wednesday the 13. of this present September, for the Collecting of the moneys so owing, and paying in of the moneys then remaining in the Collectors hands, and making the return of such as shall not pay their Assessments: And for the doing of the other things thereby required to be done, with this intimation, that all persons concerned therein, doe perform their duties accordingly, without expecta∣tion of any further time of forbearance. These are therefore once more to will and require the said Collectors, with the assistance of the Deputy and Common-councell-men within their severall Divisions, to be very active and diligent in the Collecting of the said severall Assessments. And that the said Collectors, on, or before Saturday next, do make up their Accompts concerning the same, with the said Deputy and Common councell∣men, or some of them, and pay in the money then remaining in their hands to the Treasurers as aforesaid: And that the said Deputy, Common-councell-men and Collectors doe make return to the said Grand Com∣mittee on Wednesday following of the Names of such persons within their Ward as have not paid their said Assessments, and the summes by them owing, and the reasons by them given why they doe not pay the same. And if any of the said Collectors shall be remiss and negligent in any of the said particulars before-mentioned, or shall not doe their duties according to the severall Ordinances of Parliament in that behalf; that then the said Deputy and Common-councell-men shall return their Names to the said Grand Committee, who according to an Order of the honourable House of Commons, and speciall directions of the Committee of that House are to make return to the said Committee of Parliament, not onely of the names of such persons as shall not pay their said Arrears, but also of such Collectors, Common-councell-men and others as shall fail in performance of their duties in this behalf to be further proceeded against as their neglect therein shall demerit. And there∣fore I require you to be carefull therein, not onely in regard of the present pressing necessity for the money, but also for the preventing of further danger.
