A most excellent and perfecte homish apothecarye or homely physick booke / for all the grefes and diseases of the bodye. Translated out the Almaine speche into English by Ihon Hollybush. ARNOLD BIRCKMAN W·K printer's or publisher's device Imprinted at Collen by Arnold Birckman / In the yeare of our Lord M.D.LXI.
The first chapter is concerning the head and his partes. For fallinge of the heyre of the head. MAke lye of the ashes burnt of doues dounge / and washe the heade therewyth.Fallynge of heyre. But if ye can not get doues dounge / take leaues of o∣ken tre / and seth the middelmost rippes of them in water / & wash the head oft there wt / letting it dry by it selfe / yt helpeth very well. Or els take the ashes burnt of litle frogges / make a lye therwyth / wash the head oft therewyth / that hindreth the falling of the heyre. But for ye drye skaldes of it / called in Latin Furfur / Porrigo or Pityra / seth the rotes of Malowes in water / & wash ye head oft therwith / and they shall fall of.Drye skaldes. Scelffe∣ringe of the head. He yt hath a scalfering head / let thesame take ye course brāme or wheat / & cast sething hote water vpon thē / let thē stand one day & night: after yt let it be strayned through a cloth / & put a litle vinegre thereto / & stra∣ke it vpon the head / & moystē it oft therwt / yt doth driue the scelfering away. If one hath a head that can not be healed / let him take thick creme / Vncura∣ble sores and anoynte the head therewith well in the euening and morning thre wekes continually / but let the head be first wel and bare shauen / yt the creme maye the better pearse in / washe the head euery thyrde daye wyth strong warme lye / that the head may be chased therwyth: at the last rensch the head with colde lye / thesame draweth the heate out of it / after that let it drye / & anoint it agayn as before. Of thys wyse mayest thou heale & clense a head / though it were harde crusted with corruption. But if any hath had vnclene scurfes or scabbes vpon the head / & is hea∣led of thē / howbeit it pilleth as though it wold break vp agayn / let him stra¦ke or anoynt it with oyle of flaxe sede or lyne sede / let him frot the heade sore therewyth: thesame maketh the skin stronge / harde and also cleane / that it breake vp no more. For lyse and nittes. TAke the heades of herbe Gitt or Nigella / and burne them to ashes / put swynes grese thereto / and strake or kemme the heyres therewyth / that dryueth awaye lyse and nittes.For lyse and nit∣tes. Or els bye quicksiluer for a penny / and slake it with fastinge spatle / put thereto half an vnce of swines grese or butter / anoynte therewyth a kamb / and kembe thy head therewyth / thesame driueth awaye and killeth all the nittes. But if it is in summer or haruest / that thou mayest haue the rootes of wilde saffron / take the iuyce of them: wher thesame is straked / ther slay∣eth and driueth it away the liste / and also lise of the priuy membres. Or els take a litle pece of the clothe that goldsmythes washe the gylted vessels wyth / and strake the place therewyth where they are / and they do fall of: and thys cloth mayest thou vse to twenty men / and it maye be kepte yearly and dayly / and remayneth good to vse / specially for ouerbrowes and
eye liddes / wherein the same vermin called the life of priuye membres do growe / and maye be vsed without daunger.Life of priuye mēbres. For the life of the head / take a penny worth of lorel or baye berries / bray thē to pouder / lye thē in a linnen cloth / seth thesame in running water / and wash the head there with. Thesame vertue hath also the roote of Bearfote beaten to pouder. Of payne in the head. Of payn in the heade.THe payn of the head cōmeth somtime of his oune disease / somtime of o∣ther mēbres / as of the stomake: somtime of outward accidentes / as of beating / falling or sunheat: somtime of wounding / somtime of colde: sōtyme of heat / somtime of superfluitie of blood / somtime cā it not be sayde by what occasion / somtime cōmeth ye sicknes or diseas by it selfe / & thesame lasteth cō¦tinually. But most chefely cometh it by ye vpbraything of ye stomak into the head: to heal this / is necessary to know of what complexion the disease is / yt thou mayst purge & clēse it therafter. If thou wilt than help him / take hede of what complexion ye disease is.Tokēs of headake caused of bloode. If it cometh of ye blood / the same is hote & moyst / yt shalt thou know therby / if the payne is most in ye forpart of ye head / & then are those veynes read yt are by the eyes / the face rede and hote / ye vey∣nes vnder the eyes are pale / the veynes of the tēples beate fearcely / ye veyne of the puls beateth fast and sore / and is great / his vrine is reade and thicke / hys bodye louse. These are the euident tokens of the blood. Tokēs of headake caused of Cholera.If the headake cometh of Colera / that is / of hote and drye complexion / yt shalt thou know therby: The nose is hote and aketh for heate / the tounge is great and drye / he is thyrsty / and can slepe but litle: and when he slepeth / he fighteth & is vnquiet / the veyne of his pulse is litle and feble / & feleth ye grefe most in the right side. Thesame nedeth not to blow his nose / for nothing is∣sueth out of it / by reason of the great heate. Tokēs of headake caused of Flegma.If the headake commeth of flegma / that is / of colde and moyst comple∣xion or nature / the same hath greater grefe in the hindermost part of ye head then the for part / and can slepe better: he is heuy in all his members / he is lit¦le thyrsty / the veynes of his pulse are greate and feble. Tokēs of headake caused of Melan∣coly.But if ye headake cometh of Melācoly / thē hath he ye most grefe in ye left syde of the head. Galen sayth: the head is diuided into foure partes: In the fore parte hath blood the dominion / Colera in the right syde / Melācoly in the left syde / & flegma beareth rule in the hindermost part. Headake of bloodIf the headake cometh of blood / then let him blood in ye head veyne cal∣led Cephalica / in ye hand by the thumbe / or els in the forhead. Take hede al∣so lefst his age of youth (wherby he might be to feble) hinder the: or els ye ty∣me: the same must be kept wyth dietynge / as I shall teache hereafter. Headake of Cole∣ra.If the headake cometh of Colera / thesame must be let blood at the lyuer veyne / and geue him to eate prunes of Damaske / and soure cheries though they be dryed / take oyle of roses or violettes / put thereto as much vinegre / anoynte his head therwyth wher it greueth or aketh / dip two hēpē clothes therin / & let him hold thē in his hand / ye same draweth out ye euil heat: but if ye can not haue the oyle of roses / take the whyte of egges / rose water and
vinegre / and do thus: Set his fete in hote water / and rub his legges well dounwarde: and if he will not haue thē washed / then let him dyppe the fete in colde water / and lay him doune to rest / and not slepe by day time / but be∣ware for heate and wyne. Howbeit if he will drincke wyne / let it be soure / and wel mixt / let him also drinke water sodden wyth barlye / thesame doth coole him / & let him take otherwhyles sugar candy into his mouth / to slake the thyrst / or els agayne cōfect of cheries or prunes. But he must beware of salt meates and flesh / without it were of chycken / or els let him eat soure vn¦rype grapes / or els the iuyce of them / or sorel. Let him vse a litle vinegre in his meat / but no spice nor ought yt chafeth: & take hede he be lose in ye bellye. If nede constrayne the / take Venice sope or alume / make pilles of it / & vse it for a suppository.Supposi But if ye haue ye rootes of betes / strake thē a litle wt salte / & put them vp into the fundament / or els seth hony till it be black in an earthē vssel / put a litle salt thereto / & make pilles of it / and vse them likewise. If ye haue not hony / take the iolke of an egge / & as muche salt / seth thesame toge∣ther / and make pillets thereof / the bignesse of a haselnut or filberte / and put that into the bodye / thesame retayneth the sege. If it is a man / let him be∣ware of women / for they are hurtfull for him / also of mostarde / garleke / on∣yons / lekes and suche lyke.Super∣fluity of blood. To make the nose to bleth. If the headake cōmeth of superfluity of blood / then make him thus to bleth at the nose without smarte: Take sedes of red nettels / and braye them to pouder in a morter / blow a littel of the same pou¦der into his nose with a quill. But if ye can not get sedes of nettels / put a hole of the herbe called Millesoyl or Yarbe into the nose / and rubbe ye nose outwardly softly / and then shal it bleth. But if it be in winter / and canst get nether Chyrurgeon to let blood / nor nettels / nor nettels sede / nor yet no mil∣lefoyle / and wouldest gladly drawe the blood from the head / then take two sack bandes / and binde or tye them first about the legges aboue the knye / & let it so abyde the space of halfe a Pater noster: then lose it agayne / and tye it agayne. Do this the space of a quarter of an houre: than tye his armes a∣boue the elbowe lykewyse / thus shalt thou drawe al the blood from ye head. But ye must handle thys thing warelye / leste ye let the mnbre to longe to be tyed / whereby the membre might be asconnyed or choked. But if the heade burne to sore / take the iuyce of Porceleyne / and strake the head and tempels therewyth / or where the most heate is.Heate in the head If the heade doth ake so sore / (by reason of a morre or runninge) that he can not snoffe hys nose / than were it good to vse confectes made of the apo¦thecaries / called Nasalia / and put them thereinto / or els Margerim wre∣then together / and put into the nose / for the same draweth out all euell hu∣mors.Headake of a mor. If ye can not haue the same nother / thē take a grene rote of betes / as longe as a finger and a halfe / sharped a litle and brused / put thesame into the nose and let it abide the space of a quarter of an hour / thesame draweth out also all euell humors. But if ye can not haue thesame nother / than take the sede of Cokle / that is founde in the corne / beate it to pouder / put the same into the noyse / that draweth sore. Or els take a pot / and put rapes into it / and seth them / than holde thy nose ouer it / that the vapor or hote breth ascende so into thy head / that thou do euen sweat with it.
Or take water cresses dryed / not in the sunne / but in the ayer / braye the same to pouder in a morter / or within your handes / syft it through a lynnen cloth. Howbeit if it would be to long to drye it in the ayer / then drye it in an ouen / when the bread is drawen / or els in a stoue or hote house. Headake of Melan¦coly.But if one hath payne in the head of Melancoly / his disease is come by colde / and of drye complexion. Dicte thesame and gyue him to eat meates yt are hote and moyst / to chafe hys nature and moyst hys body. If he haue no sieges / then geue him the fourth part of an vnce or iij. drames of Diacartha mi / before daye breake / and let him walke vp and doune / vntill he get a sie∣ge. But when the siege is done / then gyue hym some thynge to comfort him or that may restore hys strength / as suppinge or broth of chekins / or younge beafe / and mixe somtime a litle beaten saffron in hys meate. After that may ye geue him a fewe pigges fete / for the same make hys veynes tender and moyst / & geue him somtyme in the morning or daye tyme milke to drincke / yt is sodden with egges: that strengtheneth hym / and geueth nature force. Al∣so oughte he to bath somtime a litle in a bath made with Fenel or Heysede / gathered vpon a heye loft / & otes straw: but ye may not bath to long nor to hote. If in bathing the sweat will not in short space issue / thē go out: for thē is not the bath good for thy / & kepe thy selfe warm after it / lest thou do take colde vpon it / & beware of all meates that may coole & dry the / as mustard / garleke / onyons / lekes / also of harde or olde chese / Martinmasse beafe / Ha∣ringe / read haringe / Lynge and suche lyke. Headake of flegma.But if the headake commeth of flegma / namely of cold and superfluous moysture / then is it necessary to purge the heade wyth pilles Cochie / and pilles De iera. Beware of suche thinges as coole / and bringe corrupte mois∣ture / as fruyte / water / fleshe / fresh chese / new bread / and all that is of euel di¦gestion. His temples ought to be anoynted wyth oyl of Camomille. But if thou hast not oyle of Camomill / then take two egges shelles full of floures of Camomil / greue or seere / and seth them in wine and water together / and when it is sodden to the halfe / then strayne it through a cloth / and put ther∣to butter / so much as a gouse egge / and then boyle the water and wyne a∣waye: Bath his fete also in a depe tob / euen vntill the knees / that the hote breth maye thorou warme his body / & he may sweat. Into this water put two handfulles of floures of Camomille / and a handful of heysede well sod∣den. If he do sweat well / laye hym to slepe / & couer him warme: if he coulde sweat in the bed / that should do hym good / then gyue hym a litle grene gin∣ger / and a litle coriander stiped a night longe in vinegre and dryed agayne / thesame doth chafe his head and stomack / and consumeth the euel humors / that rise out of the stomack into the head / and trouble the braynes / that sa∣me doth it swage. Geue him also in the morninge fastinge / if he can bear it / and let him fast two houres there vpon: Take thre quarters of an vnce of aqua vite / a peny weyght of beaten saffron / and a peny weyghte of beaten Cinamon / half an vnce of Buglossen or Oxetunge water / mixe these toge∣ther / let them stand a day and night / then shall it be tempered the one with the other. Thys doth warme hys stomack / riseth into hys head / dryeth hys moyst braynes / wherof his disease commeth in the heade. Let him eat mea∣tes of good digestion / and not to muche at ones:Nota. for so longe the stomack is
colde and moyst can it not digest wel / and if he eate much / therof waxeth it full of slyme and filth / and many diseases growe of it / as payne in the head / greuous couginges / agues / gripinges in the belly / wormes / payne in ye mo∣ther or matrice / and many other: and if the payne lieth in the heade / then let him be bathed / specially wyth these herbes: Take of Valeriane and Fenell of eche a hand full / Ootes straw two handfull / a peck of Ootes / but if thou hast no Ootes / take the straw only / Heysede / of euerye one iij. handfull / put thesame into a litle sack / and seth it in a kettel wyth water / bath therwith / and when he is thorow warm and sweateth / then rensch hym wyth louke or bloode warm water / and cast a cloth or twayne ouer hym for coolinge / laye hym doune / couer hys body and head warme / that he may also sweate in the bed: afterwarde take some of the coueringe awaye / let him slepe a lit∣le in the bedde / and after that geue him a good broth of a pollet or chycken / or els a supping of yong beafe or veele that is not ouerfat / or els the broth of graye peasen / with beaten saffron the bignes of a pease: but he maye nether eat nor drink to much / & then rest a litle. If he can / let him sweat a litle after it / & be alway still / both in the bath and also bed / as he is in the heat or swea¦ting / lest he become to fel. The head washen wyth lye / wherin are sodden ye floures of Camomil / taketh away the euill humors of the head and braines yt are gathered ther in with cold: thesame doth also the water where in flou¦res of Camomil are soddē / & put vpon the head.Headake of stop∣pinge. But if ye head did thus ake / by reason of a constipacion or stopping / so yt ye could not wel take breth / thē bye halfe an vnce of Cinomon vnbeaten / and eate oft a litle thereof / or els take a pece of bread / stipe it in wine / and strowe Cinamon beaten vpon it / eate the same / that taketh awaye the stoppinge / minisheth the slyme / of the whych the stoppinge is engendred. This medicin doth also minish greatly / and taketh awaye the payne in the head: Take a pint of wine / warme thesame / then take four yolkes of eg¦ges / beate thesame in the wine / and moysten hys head well therewith: the∣same draweth out the heat / and alayeth the payne. But if the head ake were come of cold ayer or windes / Headake of cold ayer. thē wash ye head with water / wherin are sodden ye floures & herle of Camomil / after yt strake ye forhead / tēples & stomak wyth ye foresayd oyle or butter / or els stipe soft clo¦thes therin / & lay thē into the neck / the same draweth out the euil moystnes & cold / & warmeth ye head. Water distilled of Betony / & a cloth dipped there in / & pressed wel out agayne / and then wrapped or tyed hard about ye head / restoreth the head that was distempered wyth cold moysture (euen yt some fall into frensy) ryght well to his former estate. But if thou canst not get the water / but canst haue the herbe / then seth the same in wyne / mixt wyth the third deal water / and vse the same in stede of the distilled water. A wounderfull experience for the headacke. SEt a dish or platter of tynne vpon the bare head filled with water / putte an vnce and an halfe / or two vnces of molten leade therein / whyle he hath it vpon the head. Or els make a garlande of Veruayne / and wear it daye and night / that helpeth wounderfully.
Lykewyse mayest thou take two hand full of Veruayn / thesame mayst thou chappe small / & seth them in a quart of wine / put thē into a littel sack / & laye them hote vpon the heade / twise or iij. tymes / that healeth well. A slouggish or slepery disease. A slepe∣ry dise∣ase.THys disease commeth gladly and lightely of colde & much moystnesse / specially to a good folke / because their naturall heate is gone. This di∣sease is thus knowen: they haue alway great heat / whereof the cause is an impostumacion / yt lieth in the head behinde / and his vrine is pale and thick. By reason of yt disease & ye trublinge of his head & braynes / he lieth or sitteth / makinge semblance as though he dyd slepe / and yet doth not: he wendeth & waltereth / & happely his head & fete do mete together: thesame must be hea¦led of thys wise: Bye a litle nysing pouder / or els take the sede of ye Nigella that is founde in the corne feldes / beate and vse them in stede of the nysinge pouder / or els vse the floures of mustarde sede / or take beaten Mergerun gentle / put any of these into hys noyse oft tymes / and cause him oft to nyse. Rubbe also the soles of his fete oft wyth warme water / vinegre & salt / with a wollen cloth / the palme of his handes also / and kepe his belly louse wyth suppositories of alum / or other / as I haue taught before / and let him be layd in a place where much light is: let also much communication be had wyth hym / to hinder him of his slepe / and kepe him from slepinge. But if he hath great heate / then maye he be bathed in a bath / that the vncleane heat and moystnesse maye auoyde from him / and anoynte hys heade wyth water / wherein are sodden Camomille / Anis and Wormwood. Roses drye or gre∣ne were good also / of eche a few / that the water be not to stronge: for the washynge and bathynge doth muche good to the heade / by reason it doth comfort the same. To the patient may be gyuen Diapenidion / Diagalanga or Pliris cum musco / made in the Apothecarye. But if the vrine is rede / and the pulse beateth sore / then commeth the di∣sease by heate: let him then vse colde medicines / as confect of roses or violet¦tes. Also were it good ofte to burne the heyre of a man before hys nose / and he so to receyue the sent thereof. Galen sayth: He that hath payne in the hindermost part of his head / the same must be let bloode vnder the chynne / speciallye on the ryght syde. A medecin awaking a man sore, and withstandeth slepe greatly. To driue slype a∣vvay and to avvak a man.SEth or boyle Rew or Herbe grace and vinegre of lyke quantite in a coue¦red vessel / and when it is sodden / put a litle more vinegre to it / and put ye Rew into a litle cloth / & put it then agayn into the vessel wher ye vinegre is: & when thou wilt awake hym / then take the cloth / holde it to his nose / and browes / & to his temples / thesame awaketh hym continntlye / & causeth to slepe nomore. Stronge vinegre holden to his nose / so that he holdeth in hys breth / doth lykewyse: for he awaketh / and specially a fether dipped in strōg vinegre / and thrust into the nose so far that he be constrayned to nyse. Penyreal dipped in vinegre / and holden to the nose / doth likewyse.
Two thinges hinder a man of his slepe / the one is natural / the other vn¦natural.ij. Thin∣ges hin∣deringe slepe. The vnnatural hindrance of slepe weryeth a man / and coleth him inwardely. But he that hath payne in the heade by reason of exhalation or vpbray∣thinge oute of the stomak into the head / let the same eate ripe quinces after breakfast / that are well rosted / thesame refrayne the vpbraythinge into the head / and driue dounward to the siege. But if the vpbraythinge come by reason of a colde stomacke / then were it good to eate Coriander ede / after breakfast / the whych is stiped in vine∣gre a daye and a night / and dryed agayne / thys withstandeth the vpbray∣tynge of the stomack. Or els gyue him to drinke the iuyce of Wormewoode / so muche as con∣teyne an egges shell / with as much wyne: this same is good for the euil eua¦poracion or risinge vp into the head. They whyche are inclined to this disease of the heade / oughte to be litle sturringe / and beware of meates that be of euell digestion / as Martimasse beefe / salt fishes / or moulberries: for they cause euel euaporacions to rise into the head. Him also that hath headake / and woteth not whereof it is / mayest thou heale of thys wyse:Headake vvhose cause is not kno∣vven. Take a penyworth of pepper / & as much beatē mustard sede that is not steped / mixe these two together / let him take there of in hys mouth so great as a small beane / and remoue it wyth his tonge hyther and thyther / let him kepe it thus in hys mouth a whyle / and it shall drawe the euell humors out of the head into the mouth. Thys must be done fastinge / and thre houres in the daye. Headake of muche nisinge. IF a man doth nyse much / that cometh by reason of colde in the head / him mayest thou heale of this wise:Headake of much nisinge. Purge the head with pillule auree / or pil∣lule de hiera picra / after that let him eat nutmegges / Coriāder and Clares / and let him oft smell at Castoreum / or els put a drop of Oleum benedictum into his nose and eares in the morning / that chafeth / & let him eate oetmeel gruell / and drinke wyne or stale bier or ale / nother let him eat meates that be moyst of complexion / but drye. Of apostemation in the head and braynes. THe braynes are greued many waies / somtime of ye stomak / whē a man eateth meates / that the stomake can not digest / and lye sliminge & rot∣ting in the stomack / yelding an vpbraythinge into the head / wherof ye head hath euer payne / and thereof are the braynes diseased.Aposte∣matiō in the head and bray¦nes. Somtime engendreth an apostemaciō in the braynes of some litle skin∣nes / that enuiron the braynes / thesame are called Phrenesis.Phrene∣sis. He that hath ye same apostemation / can not slepe / and becommeth somtyme mad. Thesame apostemation commeth somtyme of Colera / when ye same is inflamed / and breateth vp into the heade. It commeth also of hote bloode / that lyeth in
the harte / and brarheth vp into the braynes: he that hath thesame apostema¦cion / hath also great drought in the mouth / and the tounge waxeth black / & he becōmeth read vnder ye eyes / & specially about ye nose / & such apostemaciō haue they most / yt are of hote & drye complexion / whē they labour or trauail to much. He yt hath this disease / ye first iii. dayes when it ouertaketh him / must he let blood in ye Cephalica / that is the veyne of the head / and the same daye ought he to let blood in ye forehead / or els set horselcaches or blood suc∣kers thereto. But if the horselcaches will not sucke / then anoynte the tem∣ples wyth wyne / then do they sit to by and by. Good hede ought to be takē to them and wel kept / geue thē none other meat / thē bread steped in almondes milke. Geue thē almond milke to drink & beware of meates of hote complexion / let thē be still & quiet / & beware of vexynge and anger / or els becomme they lightly franticke and madde. Beanes are not good for feable braynes nor len∣tilles.Al men yt haue feble braynes ought to beware of beanes / for they trou∣ble the braynes / and cause heuy dreames / the braynes and head sycke. The lentilles do lykewyse / for they cause euell bloode / and stop the bowels & vey¦nes / that they can not sweate / & that in such men as labour not / tender and sycke feble / they hurte the breste / the lightes / the eyes / the skinne aboute the braynes / and all the veynes of the body: Contrary to this are speces / which comforte and fortifye the bodye / head and brayes. Of whirling in the heade. VVhyr∣linge in the head.MAny are whom the heade whyrleth so sore / yt he thinketh the earth turneth vpsyde doune / ye same also hath payne in ye eyē / he thinketh yt a sorte of flyes do flye before his eyen: those may be healed of this wyse: They maye drinke no stronge drinkes nor wine / without it be wel a∣layed wyth water / & to thē ought to be geuē pilles made of half an vnce of Aloe / & a penyweyght of Mastix / geue him of them euery night fyue / ye big∣nes of smal beanes / and geue him after yt Diamargariton or Dianthos / or els Diapliris / for thesame comforte the head and stomack / and anoynte his head wyth oyle of Camomille. Or els take Betony / whose leaues must be dryed in the shadowe / and made to pouder / thesame strowe or strake vpon a pece of bread / beyng sti∣ped ni wyne / and eate thesame in the morninge and at euen / thesame resto∣reth the braynes. Or els take Cerfoil or Cheruill sodden in water / and lay it to the temples and forehead / thesame warmeth the braynes and heade / & take Pennyreal made to pouder / and drinke it wyth water of Pennyreal. Comin refraineth the whyrling / comforteth the braynes / and maketh them to growe agayne or encrease. Another for the whyrlinge. COmmen stiped in vinegre thre dayes longe / and after dried agayn / & at night when one will go to bed / kept hole in the mouth / & chawed as longe as a man can / at the last swalowed doune / etc. Some eat it made to pouder / but it is not so good. If it were a sicknes feruent / by reason of an exceding colde or whyrling /
then take the braynes of a hogge / rost the same vpon a grede yron / and cut slices therof / & strowe a pouder there vpon made of Cummin Peonye sede & Penny real in like quātite: this is very good / put therto so much misceldē or an oke / as any of ye other spices made to pouder also / & geue it to ye patiēt / let him vse this iij. or iiij. tymes after another / & he shall be healed. For it dri∣ueth out all superfluous humours of the braines / and drieth & shrpeneth it. VVhen a man can not slepe.

If the waking come of melancolia or sorowfulnesse / then becommeth a man strayght about the cheste or stomake / & his heat is dry:vvaking of melan¦colia. vvaking of reade colera. ye colour also of his skin is altered. But if ye waking come of ye rede colera / then waxeth hys skin rede colored also / then gyue him barly water to drinke. But if the wa∣king come of the black colera / then becommeth the skin of the patient pale / and he hath muche carefulnesse / anguish and pensisnesse. But if it commeth of phlegma / then becommeth the patient heuy and slouggish.

Howbeit ye must take hede / that if he haue no sieges / then geue hym to bedwarde halfe an vnce of syrope of Violettes / wyth an vnce of warme water / mixte together / but let it be colde when ye wyll ministre hym thesame: geue hym also to drinke creame / or potage of pea∣sen sodden wythout anye salte or fatnesse / onlye peasen / and let hym drincke thesame blood warme in the mornynge / lett hym after thys lye hygh wyth the head / well couered / and let him fast herevpon sixe houres. Neuerthelesse if he waxe faynte / and hath had a siege / then maye he eate and drinke a lit∣le, but beware of excesse.
The crounes vpon the poppy heades sodden in milke / make of the same a pappe / and thereof at night: the same maye be geuen a yonge childe / and it causeth to slepe fast and restlye.

Of one that hath the palsye. The pal∣sey.THe palsey taketh men sundery wyse / for somtime commeth the disease by anger / somtyme by colde / somtyme by superfluous eatinge and drin∣kinge / whereof is engendred in man ouermuche slyme / whereby the veynes are stopped / or els that the blood encreaseth excessiuely / and ouercommeth the harte / or els strayth in the membres / of the which is caused the palseye. It taketh men also that be lecherous / whose mary in the bones waysteth & cooleth / so that vnwares all his sorce fayleth / and he finally doth dye. Somtyme doth it take anye of the membres that haue ben maymed / and not well healed / whereof they waxe somtyme sere / and can not suffre the heate of the harte / whiche is cause of theyr death and destruction / and the membre becommeth lame and wrye. The cau∣ses of the palsey.This disease taketh somtyme the one membre / as hand or fote / somtyme the halfe body / or the tonge / so that a man can not speake: somtyme cōmeth it of ouermuche ioye / heuinesse / meate or drincke / ouermuche laboure / reste / slouthfulnesse / feare / swounynge / hartequake / and of supersuitye of bloode / flegma / colera or melancoly. Somtyme is the cause / that the two strynges / comminge doune from the brayne through the backbone into the fete: through the one goeth the na¦turall heate / and through the other the colde / that the same stringes (I saye) are stopped / ether the one or both. Wherfore / in whatsoeuer membre is stop¦ped thys stringe / that the naturall spirit can not come into the same / it wax∣eth lame. Let euery Physicion or Chirurgeon therfore rule him after this / and well and exactly knowe / and serche the cause of the disease / that he may the more certaynly knowe how to heale the patient. Super∣suitye moys∣ture.If moysture is cause of the disease / then muste the same be minished by suche thynges as consume it / warme and comforte the bodye / of thys wyse: Take Lauender / Sage / Cousloppe called herba Paraliis / Ren / Iuniper berryes / of eche a handfull / a pint of Aqua vite / a quarte of stronge whyte wine / putt all these into a greate potte / and set it into a kettel wyth water / and let it seth well. Wyth thys wyne streke the lymmes greued twyse in the daye / and let them drye agayne by them selues / and drinke twyse in the day of this wyne / at euery tyme so much as an egges shell conteyneth. Super∣sluity of bloode.But if the disease is comme by reason of supersluitye of blood / then must he be letten bloode incontinentlye. And if the disease is in the righte syde / then let him bloode in the lefte syde: If it is in the lefte syde / then lette him bloode in the ryght syde / in the arme / and geue hym halfe a dragme or tria∣kle in a bath / wyth warme wyne / wherein Castoreum hath ben sodden. But if thou haste not Castoreum / then take Lauender or Sage water /
drinke that / the same helpeth. But if thou haste not the water also / seeth the herbe ether of them in good wyne / and drincke it. Or els take fyne Sage / Lauender / of eche thre handfull / let them stepe in thre pintes of wyne xiiij. dayes / after that styll and drinke it. If ye can not stylle it / then seth the wine wyth the herbes / and geue hym to drinke of it. If the palsey hath taken a man, and his membres were so holy taken, that he doth not feale when he is touched vpon the same, then let him be bathed drye of this wise. COuer a bathynge vessell well and close / laye brickestones in the fyre / that they waxe glowynge hote.A bathe for the Palsye. Take also Iuniper berries / Mullen called Tapsus barbatus / and reade Organ / of eche foure hand full / seth the same well in a kettel well couered / or els in a pot / and putte sixe quartes of good wyne thereto / put hote water in the bathynge vessell / that it be well warmed. And before thou entrest into the vessel / take two tyles that be ho∣ted / put them into a tobbe / and poure of thys foresayde wyne vpon them / so that euen the very bathynge vessell be warmed wyth it: then set the patient in the vessell / and take alwaye a stone out and into the tobbe / and poure of the wyne vpon it / vntill he do sweate. But ye must beware lest he do bath to hote / that he faynt not / or that he bath not to longe. Of thys bath are all hys membres chafed / and that helpeth hym very well. Whē he goeth furth out of the bath / then let him laye himselfe vpon a bedde: and if his strēgth is so good / that he can sweat in the bed / that is very good for him. Let him al∣so beware for takynge colde. And when he waxeth drye / then let hys lamed lymmes be straked wyth water of Lauender. If ye haue not the water / then take the wyne wherein Lauender hath ben sodden wyth Sage / or els Sage alone / do thys thre tymes in the daye. If he hath streingth suffici∣ent / then let him be bathed ix. dayes longe / euerye daye ones. He ought also to be anoynted wyth halfe an vnce of Castoreum made to pouder / with ij. vnces of oyle of oliue warmed / let hys limmes be anoynted therewith thre∣se in the daye / if he can suffre it. ¶To restore agayne membres that be la∣med or taken. TAke Sage and seth it in water / put it into a longe pott:To resto¦re agayn mēbres that be l¦med or taken. if the disease is in the handes / then putte alwaye one hande into the pott / that the exhalacion come to it so hote as ye can suffre it / tyll it do sweate. After that take halfe a pounde of Aqua vite / and a hand full of Sage / and as muche Rue / cut them small / and seth them in the Aqua vite / in a pott wyth a nar∣rowe mouth / well stopped / and so putte into sethynge water. If the Aqua vite is dronke in of the herbes / than put more therin / & seth it vntil it boyleth / then put a litle therof into a gobblet or other crewyse / wel close / and chafe it so warme as ye can suffre it: stype a softe or fyne cloth
therein / and strake the patientes lymmes therewyth by a fyre. Ater yt take yle of Camomille / and put thereto as much Aqua vite / and strake thesame wyth a soft linnen cloth about the ioyntes of the paciente. The cloth oughte to be made of thys wyse / that it be as longe / that it maye couer the ioynte holy: then winde a black shepes skinne about the ioynture / euery euen and morow / xiiij. dayes continually. But if the Palsye hath taken a foote / arme or knee / then put the herbes out into a tob / laye a pece of wood therevpon / set the fete ther on / and couer the tob close. And when it waxeth colde / then chafe it agayne wyth a hote bricke / and bath the membre / as afore. But if the disease were in ether of the houkels or shoulders / then must the foresayd herbes be putt into a litle sack or bagge / beynge brode and longe halfe a yarde / and then seth it / and laye i hote vpon the taken membre: and when it waxeth colde / then to laye ano∣ther strayghte waye in the place / and anoynte hym as before / and kepe the membre that is taken allwaye warme. Lette hys meat and drincke be all∣waye seasoned wyth beaten saffron / according as he couled. Lette him also eate oft yonge hogges or porckes fete / sodden wyth rapes: the same comfort the synewes. Or els let him vse in stede of saffron / Cinamon / or els the soue∣raygne Buglosse. ¶For trembling or shakinge of the handes. Trēblīge or sha∣kinge of handes.Washe thy handes oute of a Lauor wyth colde water / and let them dry by them selues / as oft as thou doest wash them: but it were better if ye layd Sage there in. If a man standeth in feare of the Palsye / let the same eate euerye mor∣nynge two or thre mustard sedes / and two pepper cornes. Thesame is assu∣red for the same disease that daye. ¶Of dronkennesse. Dronke∣nesse.Dronkennesse commeth oft by superfluous and vndigested vapor / bray∣thynge vp / and troubling the braynes. Lykewise doth also the Son / wyth ouerchafynge heade / whereof the braynes waxe feble / and mans heade a∣keth: which accident dronken folke doth ouertake also. Dronkennesse doth also weaken the wytte and body of man wyth the memorye so sore / that he knoweth nomore what he doth / then an vnreasonable beast. To vvax dronken and yet drincke not ouer muche.It chaunceth otherwhyles to some fole / to be dronken / and yet do not drinke ouermuche: and that happeneth two maner of wayes: Fyrste that they haue so great payne / or wept so much / that thereby their braynes and head are become feble: and when they drinke / the drinkinge doth so muche the soner strike into theyr braynes. Besydes thys are many men / that by na¦ture haue a feble head and braynes / though they are no great drinkes / and therfore doth the drinke runne sone into theyr heades. This also happeneth diuerse wayes: First / because the drinkes are to stronge for them. Second∣ly / because the wedder or place where they drinke / are to hote for them / or els the Sonne hath febled their braynes. Thyrdelye / if they are in a whote
place and much noyse / whych they are not accostumed / wyth that doth the drinke swetely ouercomme them / etc. If the dronkennesse is of hote complexion / then anoynte hys head with oyle of roses / or oyle of violettes / or both mixte together / anoynte (I saye) hys head and temples there wyth:Dronke∣nesse of hote cō∣plexion. after yt geue him to drinke water of Pop¦py / beaten wyth water of roses / and mixte together lyke milke. After that set his fete into a warme water / rub them wyth salt / wyth a wollen cloth / & then anoynte them wyth oyle of violettes / that the vapors maye synke dou∣ne out of the head. After the same cause him sieges with pilles of alume or sope / or els wyth the yolke of an egge and salte. Let hys drinke be barly wa¦ter / or els syrop of violettes / wyth as muche agayne blood warme water to drinke. All thys haue I chefelye shewed therefore / that if a man douteth / he maye knowe how to helpe him selfe. I rede / that if a man do eat thre carnels of Almondes / he doth not ligh∣tely waxe dronken.Nota. He yt knoweth he is greued wyth that impediment / the same ought so much the more take hede to him selfe / lest that rudenesse and misbehaueour happen to hym: for it maketh feble euery mannis body and soule / his vnderstandynge / witte and honestie / etc. If a man is greatly thyrstinge / and dare not drinke his fill / the same shal slake hys thyrste of thys wyse:To slake thyrste. Lette him take flint stones / the bignesse of a Wallnut / and laye them in colde water / and nowe and than lette him take one of them into his mouth / that shall make hym moyste. ¶ For the fallinge euell. AGaynst the falling euell or syknesse / take miscelden of oken tre wyth the barke an vnce miscelden / of Pere tre half an vnce / the parynge of the toppet of hertes horne a quarter of an vnce:Fallinge sicknesse make of these thynges a pouder / and geue the patient thereof to drincke / the more he drinketh ther∣of / the better it is / and thys must he do fastinge. Putte also of the pouder into a cloth / and laye it vnder hys head wyth∣oute hys knoweledge / and lette hym slepe there vpon. Thys pouder must he vse in the morning fastynge / and to bedwarde at euen / and lette the pouder be refreshed euerye night. Lette also the pouder to be layde vnder hys head / and the pouder that he drinketh / be of like wei∣ghte. Thys doth helpe hym. Macer writeth that the rootes of Peony be verye good for the fallinge syknesse / if they be hanged aboute the necke.Lib. 6. simpliciū Galene dothe also write of a chylde / whych had the roote of Peonye hanging about hys neck / and was fre all that whyle of the fallinge sicknesse / that it was about it: and when it was fallen of by chaunce / than gat it his former disease agayne. Hipocrates sayth also / that he dyd tye a chylde of fyue yeares the rote of Peony aboute the necke / and it rose continentlye agayne from the fallinge sycknesse / and was hole: and thus is it twyse proued. If it be a man yt is greued wyth thys disease / let thesame take a he Wol¦ues harte / and make it to pouder / and let him vse that agaynste the disease: but if it is a woman / let her take a she Wolues harte / &c.
¶A wounderfull pouder for the falling sycnesse. Pouder for the fallinge sicknesseTAke a liuinge or quick molle / open him / and take out the entrailes / and cast them awaye. After that put the Molle wyth skinne and alltoge∣ther into an earthen or stone pott / stoppe the same wel and close wyth clay / set it then by the fyre / and let it stande vntill the moll is consumed holye to pouder. After that laye the same pouder vpon a marbel stone / that is clene washed / & take the iuyce of Cousloppe leaues or rotes two vnces / & grinde the same wyth the pouder in the Sonne. The nexte daye grinde it agayne wyth the iuyce / & agayne the thyrd daye / and let it alway drye in the Son. After that take the rotes of Basil / and stampe them / and take an vnce of ye same iuyce / and mixe them together wyth the forsayd pouder / as is sayde of the Cousloppes / but no more saue ones. After take the rotes of Gentian dri∣ed / & make a pouder thereof: of thissame pouder mixe a quarter of an vnce with the forsayd pouder. After that take an vnce and an halfe of the rote of Peony / made to pouder / and mixe it wyth yt pouder specifyed before. Hange also a root of Peony about the neck. Drinke of the forsayd pouders a quar∣ter of an vnce wyth bloode warme wyne / lye doune to bed / and couer thy selfe warme. After that in thy meate to beddewarde put the other quarter of the pouder / and do so whyle the pouder lasteth. Eate litle at nighte / no entrayles of beastes / as harte / lyuer / &c. nor sucker / and kepe good diet / and thou shalt be hole. ¶To knowe whether a man be possessed wyth an euill sprit / and how he maye be holpen.

Somtyme doth it come of the bytynge of a mad beast / or of an infecte ayer / or anger / or ouermuche sorowe / somtyme also of euyll moysture / or that a man hath had no naturall siege a great season / and the corruption is rotten within him / and the vapors are risen vp into his head / and the braynes are perfumed and corrupte therewyth / whyche causeth a man then to be wytlesse and ragious. Raginge caused by bloodIf the madnesse commeth of the blood / then doth man singe and is me∣rye / somtyme thynketh he / that he is in heauen / or els that some bodye tal∣keth to hym / saynge he is God / or an angel: somtyme that he is ryche and welthy.

Somtyme thincketh he that the stickes and strawes he seeth / are serpētes / todes or such venemous beastes /

If it is a man / thesame ought to be refreshed wyth weo¦men / thesame auoydeth anger. But if it is a woman / thesame ought to be re¦freshed wyth men / and to their company admitted: thesame bringeth them to their right minde agayne. It is good also to geue them meates of good digestion / as mutton / chykens / new layd egges / whyte breade and drinkes not to stronge. If they haue no sieges / then gyue thē pillulas cochie to bed∣ward / thesame purge the heade. It is to be considered also / that if he haue muche blood / then ought he to be letten in the middelmost veyne of the for∣head: sixe dayes after ought he to be letten blood vpon both the handes / by the thombe in the Cephalica. Let him vse meates and drinkes cold of com∣plexion / let him not drinke wine. ¶Thys drinke were good for suche one.

If he will not take it by him selfe / then open his mouth by force / and poure it into thesame. The thyrde daye after geue hym to bedward iij. pilles of cochia / and let no ayer come to him. If it is in winter / then kepe him warme in a close chamber both night & daye. But if it is in summer / then laye him in a chamber that is somwhat high / and make him a fyre of Iuniper wood / wheron the berries are / for yt is very good for him. It were good also to put saffron into his drincke and meates / his best meates were old hennes or cockes well sodden / for they do both warme and comforte him. And if he hath greate heate in his head / then make him thys collyrium:Heate. Take Housleke and leaues of Roses of like quantitie / well beaten and mixt wyth womens milke / strake the same aboute his temples / thesame couleth

Do this euerye houre ones / and whan he will go to bed / then laye them cloth vpon hys eyen / and strake of thys confection wyth a fedder into hys eyen / thesame taketh awaye the smarte also. But it were verye good to laye firste the whyte of an egge and rose water to his nape of the necke. Also if the head and eyes do ake / then make a foote bath / A bath for sore eyes. and lette hym sitte there in vntill aboue the calfe of the legge / couer hym well / that the vapor maye stryke vp to hys body / and chafe him / also rubbe him his legges

Experi∣ence.The rote of Pilletory taken in the mouth in the morninge and at euen knawed / but not eaten / and then the mouth washed wyth halfe vinegre & halfe water: thesame draweth doune the heate through the mouth / and mi∣nisheth the heat in the head and eyes. Reed ey∣es.But if the eyes remayne read / then take of that water that standeth in the leaues of wilde Tasill / and put that into the eyes: or els the water that droppeth out of the veynes in marche / when they be most communlye cutte and bound vp / put thereto the thyrde parte as muche whyte of an egge bea¦ten. Also if a read spott or a bloody marke dyd remayne in the eyes / thē take the whyte bladder / hauing at the yolke of an egge / called the chycken / put that in the eye in the morning and euen. VVeke eyen or syght.If a pore body hath weake eyen or sight / wilt thou kepe them that they waxe no worse / take the tounge of a foxe / & hange the same about his neck / and so longe it hangeth there / shall not the sight waxe feable nor weake / as sayth Pliny. Lykewyse doth it also to him / that eateth or knaweth euerye morninge fastinge fyue or sixe sedes of Iuniper / and holdeth the nethermost lippe aboue the vpper / and holdinge his hande before his mouth / bloweth / and receyueth the breth into his eyen. Spottes ī the eyē.For spottes in the eyen / take the herbe Veruayne wyth his rote & hole the substance / tye the same about thy throte / and weare it / vntill the spottes perishe and fayde: the herbe maye be sowed with a linnen cloth aboute the necke. Spurre blinde.If one were spurre blinde / which also is caused by superfluous humidi∣tye of the head / when the veynes of the syght are stopped wyth payne / & yet are the eyes fayre and clere / so that a mā can not perceyue he is spurr blind / wythout one do take good hede. At the last getteth he many syckely & we∣ke veynes or spottes about the forhead. The appel or ball of the eye of some men doth breake / so that the innermost of them doth rotte / and the sighte of the eye perisheth: the same also haue oft payne in the heade. But this disease do lightely gret women whose floures fayle before it be tyme / and specially women that haue colde heades. If thys were loked to otherwhyles / a man might well be holpen / wyth geuing a quarter of an vnce of Iera pirra that he were purged: he muste beware also of thynges that cause euell humores and of inordinate meatinge or drinkinge. Runnige eyen.If a mans eyen do runne of superfluous humiditye / then laye Walnut leaues in colde water / and to bedwarde shake the leaues that the water a∣uoyde from the leaues / and laye one of them vpon the one eye: and when it waxeth drye / laye an other vpon it / the same draweth the euill moysture
and heate out of it / and clenseth the eyen. He that hath a dymme syght / let hym take the water of Dandelion or of Cicory / and put thesame into his eyen / and they shall waxe clere.Dymme syghte.

The rote of Veruin or cut Malow / called in Latin Alcea / hāged about the neck / driueth awaye spottes and blemishes of the eyen / whether it be in a man / or horse / as I Ierome of Brunsweig / autor of this treatise / haue sen my selfe.Spottes or blemi¦shes ī the eyen. I haue also myself done it to a blind horse / yt was first bought for x. crounes / & was sold agayn for xl. crounes / the which was hanged the roote about the neck / & gaue him the herbe chapped wyth his meat or prouander. He that hath gotten dust or such other thynge into hys eyen / let him lye vpon his back / & let him put into his eyē iij. or iiij. sedes of Clary / let him cle∣se his eyen / & than do they rolle about into the eyen / and drawe ye dust with them.Duste in the eyen This is proued by the wild clary / called communly Oculus Christies sede / that it doth so. The stones also founde in the mawe of swalowes / and specially yonge ones / do lykewyse. ¶To heale all maner disease of the eares. SOmtyme is the hearing lost clene / so that a man heareth nothinge at al / or a litle.Diseas of the eares He that is so diseased / must be layd in the sunne in summer / and loke into hys eares / whether ought be fallen into them: or els whether an apostemacion / or bluster / or any other thinge be in it / whereby his hearinge might fayle. But if nothing is found nor sene in therein / then is it sure / yt the grefe commeth from within ye head / of some vapor yt is gathered ther / wher by the hearing is stopped / or els of some apostemacion in ye head / wher ye or∣ganes of hearing are. And he yt is so diseased / speaketh so softly / yt he can scar¦sely be vnderstand / & is troubled with slepe.Cure. To thesame ought be geuen iij. pilles de iera picra Galeni / the same draw the humors from ye eares & head / & cause him to nyse. After yt set boxes vpon the one eare / to draw the fylt out of ye head. But if a man is lettē blood in the head out of scason / thesame hur¦teth him sore / and causeth hym to become deafe. If a man haue a sounding or piping in his eares / the same cometh som∣tyme of a hote slymy fylthynesse / or of a hote slymy moystnesse.Soūding in the ea∣res. He that is so diseased / ought to take pilles de iera picra / & then put oyle of Hempsede war¦me into his eares / mixt wt a litle vinegre / after yt let him leape vpon hys one legge / vpon that syde / where the disease is / than let hym bowe doune ye eare of that syde / if happely any moysture or fylth would issue out. This disease commeth somtyme of the Summer heate: he that is disea∣sed therof / hath great heat in hys heade. Put woman milke and Hemsede oyle mixte together into his eare / on that syde where he is diseased / that a∣layeth the heat. Let him that is deafe take a handful of Rue or Herbe grace / Cure of deafe. & chappe or

Then let him go into the hote house / and when he doth sweat well / take a thonnel wyth a longe pype / yt he maye couer the pot holy therewyth / make hote the pot / and let the vapor go thorow the thonnel into the eare. If it be in winter / and canst haue no Rue / then seth beanes of one yeare in water / and do lykewyse. If ye haue no beanes nother / than take Heysede vpon a heyelift sotten in water / and vse thesame as is sayd of the Rue / so hote as ye can suffer it. Soūding ī the hea∣de.Agaynst the soundynge and whysperinge in the head / put warme wa∣ter into a lauer / and let it droppe softely vpon the hindermost of the patien∣tes heade / by thys droppinge is the soundynge and noyse in the head taken awaye. And when the lauer is emptye / then fyll it agayne / vntill the payne is awaye. Hearing euill.He that heareth euell / let him seth Iuniper berryes and Sauin of lyke quantitie in good wyne / put into a new pot / well dressed and stopped: then let him bore a hole thorough the lidde of it / and laye his eares vpō the hole / to receyue thesame vapor. ¶Agaynst soundyng and ringinge in the eares.

Blething at the no¦se.BLething at the nose is somtime good / somtyme euill. He that hath a Catharre / that is a rewme or stillinge doune of humores in the head / or an apostemacion / blethinge at the nose / is good for him. It is also a good token / if the blood waxeth to hote in the bodye / and runneth vp into the head / and fylleth the veynes so sore / that they do breste. If the blood then come furth at the ryght nose trill / thē let him blood at the Cephalica vpon the same syde vpon the hande / by the thombe. But if the blood commeth furth at the left nosetrill / then tye his legge aboue yt kne wyth a strong list or swadeling band / then remayneth the blood in yt legge: after that beat egges shales to pouder / and syft then through a linnen cloth / and blewe them into his nose: if the shales were of egges / whereout yonge chickens are hatched / it were so much the better. Or els take the dounge of an asse / mixe the same wyth vinegre / and holde the same at his nose. Lyke∣wyse doth the dounge of a Sowe or Swyne that hath eaten grasse.Staūchīg of blood He that bletheth so sore / that nothynge can staunche hym / it is good to

It is good also to tye ye herbe called Shepherdes burse about his neck / or els geue it hym to holde in his hande / vntill it waxeth warme / and dight it in hys meate. Or els take a soft linnen cloth / the length & bredth about of half a yarde / wett the same in cold water: but if ye haue vinegre / take of ly∣ke quantitie / and tye it about hys preuy membre. If it is a woman / then let her holde it to her priuities. And if ye haue no vinegre / then binde hym the cloth about hys necke / dipped in water only / and when it waxeth warme / than wett it agayne. It is to be consydered / that thou do lose hys gyrdel / & set him vpryght / lest he do hange forward.

If the blood come out from the head / so that a man hath gotten a risinge of the blood in∣to the head / that shalt thou know thereby: he hath payne in the forhead: the same must be letten blood in the Cephalica / that is ye vrine of the head. But if the superfluity of blood or blething cōmeth of ye liuer / then hath he payn in ye right syde wyth a stiche: thesame ought to be lettē blood on the right hād / by ye litle finger / in ye veine of ye liuer. But if the blood cōmeth of ye splene / thā hath he payne in ye left syde wyth a stich: thesame ought to be lettē blood on the left hand / by the litle finger in ye veyne of the splene: the same also oughte not be gyrded / nor yet weare any weyght about hys body / nether deck him warme: he must beware also of all that might warme him / and be quiet.Nota. It is to be marked / that when he that hath the pestilence bledeth / and can not be staunched / nor cease / it is an euident and sure token of death. ¶Of spottes and blemishes of the face. IF a man hath spottes or blemishes in the face or vnder the eyes / or wher they be / take the rote of Couckoupintel or Wake robin / stampe thesame / and strake the iuyce there of in the morninge and euening vpon them / and they go awaye.Spottes in  Or els take the stone growynge of wyne life / beat the same very smal / & hang it wyth a cloth in a moyst sellar / set somthing vnder it / for out of it shall drop water: wyth the same anoynt the spottes vnder the eyes oft tymes / but beware it come not into the eyes. Or els anoynt thy selfes wt the water yt standeth in the wild Tasill leaues / or els with the water yt drop¦peth out of the Vine / when he is cutte and bounde vp in Marche / thesame do oft. Or els anoynt the spottes oft wyth the iuyce of the rote of Briony or wilde neppe / beaten and strayned. Agaynst a fistula by the nose / take the slyme of a sowes guttes / and bur¦ne that to pouder / put thesame pouder into the disease / it healeth thesame / for it hath ben expeimented.A fistula by the nose. ¶Agaynst euill scabbinesse or schilfering chekes / that will not heale nor fall doune.

Diseases of the mouth.AGaynst the stinking of the mouth / chawe oft in the daye herbe called Cinkfoly or fyuefyngered grasse / and it shall go awaye in four dayes. If ye haue eaten garleke / and your breth sauoureth strong after thē / eat the leaues of Rue or herbe grace / and it shall not be perceyued with you. If a man haue great heat and drought in his mouth / so that he thinketh hys mouth will burne / then take the water of Marche se in thy mouth / that slaketh it. But if thou haste not that / laye foure or sixe flinte stones / so bigge as a Walnut in colde water / and take alwaye one of them into thy mouth / and holde it therein: and when it waxeth warme / take it oute / and laye it in colde water agayne / and take another into thy mouth. This doth much good / and slaketh also the thyrst. ¶Of all diseases of the teth. The vse and disea¦ses of the teth.THe teth are created to chawe the meat therewith / that it maye be the more apte to digestion / they ayde also to the speche / to retayn the breth / and to mandorning or continesse. They haue  payne and sinerte / as other members or lymmes / namely knawynge / holes / wormes / wagging / apostemation in the gummes / corrupt humors and blood of the gummes. ¶A sure medicine for toothake. A sure medicin for toth¦ake.TAke a garlyke head / pil it / beat it in a morter / that it waxe soft / moisty / and that it be not hole: and loke on what cheke or syde the toth ake is / on that arme binde the garlike / vpon the wrest of the arme / wher boxes are set most communly / so that it do not touche the mousse of the hande / and lay it as nere together as ye can: couer it wyth a spoune or brode Walnutshell a hole nyghte / and then will it caste a bluster: pearse thesame through / or els will it burst by it selfe. But if ye will haue it runne sore / take a leafe of Dan∣wurt or Walwurt / and turne the rough syde inwardely. And if thou wilt haue it to heale / then take the Walwurt leafe / and turne the smoth syde in∣wardely / and it healeth. ¶To make a tooth so fall wythout smarte.
SEth as many litle grene frogges / brething or sitting vpon trees / as thou canst get in water / vntill the fleshe do consume:To make  teth fall out vvith out smart take the fatt flowyng v∣pon them / and kepe it in a clene thyng / and when nede is / anoynte the teth therwyth.

A pece of the grene rote of Termentil doth lykewyse. ¶Of the swellinge in the rote of the mouth / called in Latin Vua or Vuula. THe swelling that is caused of a cold slimy humor / falling out of ye head / and hanginge in the rofe of a mans mouth / is called in Latine Vuula / whych hindreth a man of his speche: thys shal be cured of this wyse:Svvellīg in the throte. If it is of superfluous blood / then is the disease read / long and greate / & the veynes f the forheade are grosse and swollen / then let him blood in the Cephalica vpon the hande. But if it commeth of other accidentes / as of superfluous moysture and colde / then take whyte dogges torde that is dry / and make it to pouder / and take commune salt / and drye it in a panne vpon the fyre / so yt it waxe euē broune: braye thesame of like quantitye together to pouder / put that to the swellinge or disease: for it is good and vpright.

Or els take Sal armoniacum / and make a pouder therof / & heaue the swelling vp therewyth. It is very good to let him blood vnder the tounge / or els vpon both the thumbes / when the disease beginneth: for it helpeth him. Some do cut it of: but that is dangerous. They that be so diseased / must beware for cold drin∣kes / and specially of milke and chese. An other experience for the swelling in the rofe of the mouth / or els him yt can not wel take breth / whiche I haue oft shewed poore people / namely / to pull ye patient sore by ye earlap vpwardly / & incontinently shall he be healed. ¶How to helpe one that hath the Squince in the throate / called the Squinancia. THe Squince or Squinancy is an apostem in ye throte / & is very dange∣rous. If it cometh in a siknesse / then is it dāgerous / & if it cometh in an ague / thē is it not so dangerous. To such a patiēt ought to be geuē gruell of
otmeel / well lifted through a cloth / and put therto ten or twelue almondes well beaen: and when it is dressed in a vessel / put a litle suker to it / and at∣so wyth breade. But if he hath an ague wyth it / geue him of a quillis of a cocke without breade / and make him a drinke of thys wyse: Take of Lyco∣ris / cut small j. vnces of suker haf an vnce / seth thē in water / skinne it wel / and let him hold it awaye a litle in the mouth / and wambel it roundabout in the mouth. Make him also this playster to laye outwardely. Cure of squinacyTake whyte dogges dyrte thre vnces / Dittanye beaten pouder an vn∣ce / grene Wormwod brayed smal an vnce / halfe an vnce of barly floure: mi∣xe these al together with hony / strake it vpon a cloth / & lay it warme about hys necke. Thys playster hath healed many / it healeth a man / or els dyeth he ye fyft daye. Somtyme breaketh ye swellynge out outwardely / but ye in∣ward is deadly for it doth lyghtely choke a man. It is therefore diligently to be marked what occasion of ye disease hath. Yf it cōmeth of reed Colera / whiche is hoe & drye / than hath ye pacient greate payn & anguyshe / & wyth ye greate heae & thyrste. Make hym a playster outwardely about hys neck of Popular leaues & sede / seeth it well / & temper it wyth oyle of violets & Ca¦momille / and strake yt vpon a clothe / and laye it warme aboute the necke. But yf ye can not haue yt oyle / take the leaues of Elder / leaues of reed kole / of eche a handefull / chapped smal & brayed / seeth them wyth hony and butter / of eche a spounfull. Laye thys warme about hys necke. Thyssame hath holpen and healed many: or els make hym any of the playsters of the swalowes nest folowynge. But yf the Squynce is of superfluous blode and heate / than must he be lett bloude incontinent in the ryght hande vpon ye thombe in ye Cephalica / & vnder ye tunge: In ye hand vpon foure vnces / & vnder ye tunge vpon two vn∣ces. And as soone he is letten bloude / must be made thys drynke for hym to gargelle: take about fyue vnces of Diamoron / take one vnce thereof mixte wyth warme water / holde yt in the mouth / gargell therewyh & spytt it out / cause hym to do thys fyue tymes. The next daye let boxes be set vpon hys necke / wythout scrapynge / these shulde drawe ye bloude from thence. Or els bynde about hys necke / as I haue taught before / and let thys byndynge be thre tymes wythin daye & nyght / at euery tyme a quarter of an houre. Make hym thys plaster: Take the nest of a swalowe or pye / but ye swa∣lowes nest is the beste wyth all the substaunce / as claye / grauell / styckes or fethers / nothynge excepte / beate it / and syft it through a course syffe / so tat it maye be fined / put thereto hony & greace / and make a playster there of / strake it vpon a cloth / and laye it about hys necke. Of thys wyse haue I hol¦pen one in iij. houres space. Item make hym thys drynke: Take Licorys / Anis / Fygges and greate Raysons / of eche an vnce / seeth them in a pottel of water / and geue hym euery tyme thereof to drynke. But yf thou canst not haue these thynges / & arte farre from ye Phisicion / & hast a swellinge in thy throte / than is nothynge better than to take war∣me Mylla & gargel thesame as hote thou canst suffre it: thys done ofte / ta∣keth awaye ye sycknesse / and mollifyeth ye apostemacion. Lykewyse maye be done wt mylcke or water / wherein is sodden knapwede / otherwyse called Deuels bit. And whē ye apostemacion is brokē / geue him warme yolkes of
egges that be soft / and barly gruel / and geue hym to drinke water / wherein Barly is sodden / that purgeth and healeth hym. ¶For the hoorsnesse. HE yt is waxen hoorse by reason of an humor descending / or coughinge / of a cold ayer or drinke / of creyng or weping:Horsnes and the causes thereof. let the same drinke in the morninge warme water / as hote he can suffer it / and wet a linnen cloth in half water and half vinegre / wringe it well oute / and winde it aboute the necke / and another that is warmed vpon the same: do thys in the morning / at middaye and to bedwarde / lette hym kepe hym warme and beware of colde ayer. If he coulde sweate in the bedde / that were very good. Let him also beware of cold drinkes / fruytes / grapes / and such lyke. He maye also drinke warme milke / in the morning and euening / the sa∣me doth auoyde horsenesse also. Or els take Aqua vite when thou wilt go to bed / stipe a pece of bread therin / and eate the same at euen and morning: but if he is of hote complexion / then is Aqua vite not good for him. He that is so hoorse / that the lightes seme to ascende into his throte / and he is of cold and moyst complexion / thesame should drinke fasting a quarter of an vnce of oyle Benedicti / mixt wyth a litle water / though it be vnplea∣sant to drinke / yet is it good and without daunger. But if ye can not haue the oyle / then eat Anis sede: thesame is holesome and good for the horsenes. Or els sede the karnels of Quinches / and drinke that water warme to bed¦warde. Or els take thre vnces & an halfe of flint stones / put to them a quart of springing water / and seth it to the halfe / drinke thereof blood warme in yt morning & at euen / and it shall go awaye. Or els geue hym this drinke folo∣wyng: Take wyne & oyle of oliue of lyke quantitie / seth them in some thing & drinke therof so hote thou canst at night / and in the morning a good drau∣ght: thesame taketh the horsenesse away without danger. But if thou canst not haue oyle of olyue / then take halfe so much butter as the wyne is / and do as is sayd before. ¶A confection to holde in the mouth agaynste hoorsenesse. TAke fyne mustard sede mele / put thereto foure tymes the weight of ho¦ny / make therof a confection / put it vpon a trenscher / and cut in peces: but set in a coole place for meltinge / & holde one of these slyces in thy mouth in the morning and eueninge / and let them melte by them selues. Or els geue him this drinke:A drinke for horse¦nesse. Take Penyreal a hand ful / cut it smal / and seth it with a pint of vinegre / tyll the thyrde parte is sodden in / then strayne it through a cloth / and geue the patient to drinke therof in the morning and euening alwaye a spounfull. Or els take a great appel / roste the same well / slice it / and laye it hote in a dishe wyth water / and eat it. This oughte to be done to bedwarde / and couer thy selfe wel and warme / put thy head vnder the couering as far thou canst / or els couer thy head and face that no ayer come into thy mouth: thesame is good / and driueth awaye horsenesse. He that is become hoorse lately / let him roste a rape in ashes or vpon the
fyre / yt she be all black / then pare her clene / & eate her as warm thou canst: & drinke a draught of water as warm thou canst suffer it. Then wett a cloth in colde water / strayne it well out / and winde it so about thy neck: vpō the same binde another cloth well warmed / and do thys when thou goest to bedde / & in the morninge / for it driueth hoorsenesse awaye without danger. ¶An experimented science for horsenesse though it hath longe lasted.

Do this thr nightes one after the other / and kepe thy selfe warme / and beware of colde drinkes and ayer / and it shall surely go from thy wythout hurte. This same is good also for the flixe and cough. Geue the patient also Lycoris in hys mouth. Agaynst horsenesse go into the hote house / and when thou hast half ba∣thed / drinke a good draught of warme water. This is oft proued. Garlk sodden and eaten maketh a cleare voyce / and driueth away hor¦senesse and the olde cough. ¶Of the yexe or yexinge. The yexe and hys causes.THe yexe commeth somtyme by reason of the superfluous emptynesse of the body: somtyme of superfluous fyll of the stomak. If it commeth by reason of the emptinesse / that signifyeth the sick or patient sufficiently / whe∣ther he hath a long season not eaten or dronken / or els whether he hath had outragious sieges. Him shalt thou hlpe of this wise: Seth an old hen with a quarter of an vnce of Cinamome / & a quarter of an vnce of Mastix / & ge∣ue hym that broth to drinke / and the hen to eat. Geue him also Hogges fete and whyte wyne. If he be not hote / geue hym confect of Quinches: but if he hath great heat / then geue hym sukar of Roses. Fil of the stomake.But if it is of superfluous eatinge and drinkinge / then make him to per∣breake wyth Oken leaues / or els as I shall teach you hereafter in the chap¦ter of vomiting. Or els take a cake of roses and Wormwod / of lyke quanti∣tie / of eche a handfull / and seth that in read wyne / and laye it wame vpon the stomack. Or els let him saye ought wherewyth he may be sore astonied / and he shalbe ridde of the yexinge. But if a man doth yexe sore in a sycknes / it signifyeth most communely death. ¶Of suppuration or matteringe in the breste. Suppura¦tiō in the brest.HE that hath a mattering in ye brest caused of cold / ought to beware for colde / and eschue the ayer / let him lye hygh or sitt vpright / let him not slepe much / & in his slepe ought he be waked otherwhiles / yt he may himme. Make hym a butter suppe of halfe water and halfe butter / let that be well sodden / and putte not muche breade therein / and eate that broth as hote
as he can. Thesame broth let hym drinke to bedwarde / that weakeneth the corrupcion very well / and maketh it apt to be cast out. Also ought litle meat be geuen hym at ones / and lytle drinke: for the corruption groweth ye more of muche eatinge and drinking. Let him alwaye be hungery and thyrstye / nether eat any fishes nor speces / nether drinke any soure drinke. A syrop of Violettes were good for him: but if ye haue not that syrop / thā make a milk of Hempsede / of water and hempsede / or els in stede therof take creme / and eat that / thesame cooleth and softeneth the harte wythoute hurte or daun∣ger. After meate ought he to walke a litle / hauinge alwaye a warme cloth before hys mouth / that the ayer do not hurte him: for of the walkinge doth the corruption louse. Ye must also take diligent hede that he haue good sieges. Also were it good he dyd sweate in the bedde if he be so stronge / or els to cause him to sweat wyth a bath made in a kettel / and so to lay him to bed to sweat. This bath ought to be made wyth Valerian and Ootstrawe / and couered wyth warme shetes / for these thynges weaken the corruption. Item / rost onyons / and eate them / a litle butter therin / were very good. He that hath a drye cough / and doth not caste out / it is an euident tokē / that thesame hath an euell stomack / that doth not well digest / whereby are caused many greueous diseases.A drye cough. But if he voideth spatle that is whyt / mixt wyth bloode / and that wyth payne / thesame is a signe of a priuy digestion / and of a disease of the pulino or lightes / and that is deadly. But if he casteth out afterward wythout smarte / whyche neuerthelesse is a litle redish / thesame is a signe of apparance of digestion / and nature be∣ginneth to clense / and is perfecte. He that hath a cough wyth payne in ye brest / the same ought not to bath in water / nother eate nuttes / nor oyle of nuttes / nor poppye sede oyle:Cough vvyth payne in the brest but lette hym drinke water sodden. If hys cough commeth by colde / then lette hym drinke good wyne. A man that hath great disease in the brest / and also in the heade / if thou wilt helpe hym / and purge the head and breste wounderfullye of all slymye fleumes and fylth / without any cost:Payne in the brest and head Take two or thre rotes of Bet / wash them clene / and drye them well / then braye them small / strayne thē through a cloth / and a very blewe iuyce shall come out of them: vpon that shall ye se a whyte fome / blowe the same awaye / and take of that iuyce thre or foure droppes in a quill / and drawe it into thy head through the noses: or els fyll a fylberts shell full of it / and draw it so in through the nose. Then clise thyne eyen and nose wyth both thy handes / and wythin a quarter of an houre is∣sueth a great deale of slymye moystnesse oute of thy mouth / whereof a man maye maruayle.Experi∣ence. I haue ones sene sixe vnces runne out of a mans mouth at one tyme. And out of myne oune mouth is of this wyse four vnces run out / where I thought I shoulde haue had none at all. ¶Of an imposteme in the breste. The cause of an imposteme is of superfluous euill flegma in the head or stomake:The cau∣se of apo¦stemes. wherefore when the head and stomake are purged of the flegma /
then go the apostemes awaye also by themselues. Let the patient eate litle or nothinge / and that meates of good digestion. A drinke for apos∣temes.Make him this drinke: Take Mayden heyre / called also Colāder / whyt Endiue / Scabiose / Morsus diaboli / yt is / Deuels bit / of ech a handfull: Bar¦ly pilled or puched / an egges shel ful / waters so much as is cōuenient / or els ij. quartes: seth these ij. fynger bredth awaye. After that streyne thē through a cloth: & of yt make a hēpsede milke / with a good porenger ful of washē hēp¦sede: of ye same geue him half a good cruys ful to drinke blood warme in the morning & at night. But if ye haue not ye herbes / then make a hēpsede milke wyth barly only / and drinke that half a cruys of goblet full. A salf for apostemsAfter that make him this salue / and anoynte him therewyth aboute the brest. Take fresh butter or creme / or els both in like quantitie / seth therin lea¦ues / & the sede of Malowes / streyne it than through a cloth / and anoint his brest therwith. If ye put capons grece therto / yt were very good. After that were it good to make him a clister or a suppository as is perteyning hereto. And this oughte euery Physicion know & serche of what cōplexion ye patiēt is / & whence ye disease commeth / & what medicine is conuenient for it. For if the Physicion doth it not / and ministreth to him that whych is contrary to hys nature or complexion / than doth he misorder the patiēt / & is gilty of hys payne or happely death. For this cause ought no Physicion to truste to hys sciēce nor wysdome only / but aske & enquire of ye patiēt or other al circūstan¦ces / to what fashion ye disease doth encline. He ought also to se & vewe ye vrin fele ye pulse / & to behold the patientes phisiognomy. Thē may the Physicion minister to ye patiēt so much ye more boldlier medicins / according to ye sciēce: & to such a Physicion maye a man trust so much the better: for he may be cal¦led a true Physicion. For apostemes in ye brest are dangerous / & therfore is it true & necessary / to know by what complexion or tēperatur ye diseases are caused.Apostēs of Cole∣ra. Apostēs for fleg∣ma or colde. If ye disease cometh of read Colera / or blood / thē ought ye to mi∣nister ye patiēt al such thinges / as I haue taught in ye precedēt chapter. But if it is caused by flegma or cold / then make him thys salue / and anoynt hym about the brest. Take an vnce of butter / capon or hennes grece an vnce / oile of Baye or sorel half an vnce / and mixe them together / & anoynt him about the brest therwith / and laye vnwashen wolle therevpon that is black. But he must refrayne from salt meates / and of all soure meates. ¶Agaynst breakinge vp and vomiting. Agaynst perbrea∣kynge.TAke a pece of bread stiped in salt and vinegre / bruse it / and make it lyke a thicke playster / & laye it vpon ye cheste or hartes holownesse / wher the mouth of the stomake is. And if ye strake it about ye patientes mouth / yt com¦forteth him / and geueth hym strength. Item ye water wherein karnels of quinches haue lyen or stiped / ye same refrayneth the breaking vp of the stomake: for it comforteth ye stomak / & ma¦keth good digestion. But whē ye tyme of the quinches is / then maye they be sodden alone / without sucker & hony / in stede of confect for ye hart / & so vsed. ¶The ryght makinge of Ptisana / that is / Barly water.
Barly water / communly called Ptisana / is praysed and commended of all Physicions / and is a souerayne medicine agaynst all colerik and subtile heate / it openeth the oppilacion or stopping / it moueth sweat & vrine / it mol¦lifyeth ye belly boūd with hard fylth / it causeth slepe / & alayeth thyrst / it doth also partly norish / it is conuenient for al partes of the breste & the poulmon. Ptisana is taken somtyme warme / to cause sweat / somtime cold to alay thyrst / somtyme wt suker / somtyme without suker / somtyme much / somtime litle. The ministratiō therof at one time is is a cruys full / that is iiij. vnces / howbeit it must be ministred to an emptye stomake / or at the lest not ouer∣charged. It is somtyme taken by daye of the thirsty diseased / and is conue∣nient in feruent agues and many other diseases. Take fulgrowen barly that is heuy / & not wythered / take also clere run¦ning water / yt hath his course toward the East / whose grounde is stony or sandy. Of this water take x. partes / & of the barly one parte:Making of Barly vvater. put them toge∣ther into a clene pot / make a slowe fyre vnder it of wood twelf houres long tyll the water is colored of the barly yalow rede / like to bier: after that take it of and let it coole / and vse it. ¶Howe he maye be holpen that speweth blood. HEmoptoica is a disease / whē a man speweth blood at ye mouth / wher∣of the cause is superfluity of blood / & thys shall be knowē of this wise:Spevvīg of blood he is full of body & redish / his veynes are great. Somtyme commeth it out of the stomake / & then hath the patient payne in ye brest before. But if it com¦meth of the leuer / then hath he payne in the ryght side. And if it commeth of the lunges or lightes / then hath he payne in the left syde / & cougheth muche. Somtyme doth it also come of falling or ryottinge / and thē must he be hol∣pen of thys sorte: He must beware of anger / of long fasting / of sour or bitter meates and drinkes / and of surfetting.The cur He ought to be let blood on the same hande / where the disease is. If it is of the leuer / then must he be let blood in the right hand: but if it is of the lunges / then ought he to be let blood on the left hande / and geue hym thys medicine. Take Plantayn & wild Tasil / wyth ye water yt stādeth in the Tasil / put thereto reyne water / & streyne it through a cloth: of this geue the patient to drinke in the morning fasting and to bedward. But if the wild Tasil haue no iuyce / then seth it in reyne water / bray it / & strayn it through a cloth / cast the herbe away: then take the broth / put suker therto / & geue it the patiēt to drinke. Geue him also in the morning and euening to drinke goates milke / or pouder made of moulberries: or els geue him to drinke reyn water wher¦in are sodden shepeherdes purse / knotgrasse and waybred / braye them whē they are sodden / streyne them through a cloth / & geue him to drinke thereof thre tymes in the daye / euery tyme a good draught. Geue him also thre day∣es one after the other to eate wheat wyth water and butter. ¶If one speweth oute mater. Thesame may he holpē of this wise: Geue him Diapenidion or diagagātū.
Ye must marke also / that if ye laye the matter or corruptiō / that he voydeth vpon hote coles / and it stynketh / then signifyeth it the rotting of the poulme or lightes / whych is very euill and deadly: to such one ought no man to mi∣nister medicine / for he is to sore sycke. But if he haue great heat in hys sycknesse / then saye al Physicions / that nothynge is better / then to geue him to drinke barly water. Thys heate is knowen by the vrine / whether it be great or not / by the chaunce of the vrin / and the thycke of it synketh to the bottom. But if the disease will last longe / then geue the pacient what he lysteth / and if he waxeth a litle stronger ther of / then geue hym more: if not / geue hym no more. Ye must marke also / that if he be sycke of an ague or lyke disease / then lette hym be geuen what he lis∣teth / whyle the disease lasteth. ¶When one woulde gladly perbreake / and can not do it. Perbrea∣king of a diseased stomake.THe perbreakinge happeneth manye wayes: somtyme by the disease of the stomake / as namely / when the stomake casteth from the bottom yt meate / and can not kepe it / whyche happeneth that the nethermoste part of the stomake is stronger then the vppermost. The cause of thys must be con∣sydered by thesame that is wyded. Perbrea∣kinge by grefe of the stoneSomtyme commeth it by the grefe of the stone / or els the corruption then will growe to matter / that ther of he doth perbreake. Thissame is wel perceyued by the vrine / and also whether he hath payne in the loynes / blad∣der / or back. Perbrea∣kinge of colde moyst∣nesse.If the perbreaking commeth of cold moistnesse or humors / then is it ye∣lowe. It is to be knowen / that ye ought not to staunche that perbreakinge vntill the stomack be clensed of the euill humors / after that oughte it to be prouided. If the perbreakinge be sounde and harde / that the patient can haue no sieges / then geue him Cassia fistula / and clense him.Perbrea∣king that is harde. But if the perbreakinge is of the reade Colera / by reason of a hote sto∣make / then geue hym soure bitter Pears to eate / or els geue hym Sorell to drynke / or els geue hym syrop of Violettes to drinke with water in the mor¦nynge and euenynge.Perbrea∣kinge of read Co∣lera. Item medlers eaten fastyng / wythstande perbreakinge caused by heat. Lykewyse doth Minte eaten fastinge / and Anis eaten mornynges and e∣ueninges. Or els take a colde flynt stone / and holde it to the necke of the patient / & the perbreakinge ceaseth. Or els take a hand full of fethers / and put them in to a pot / and put to them glowynge hote coles / and holde thy mouth ouer it wyde open / that the vapor or smoke may go into it / and then shal the wam∣blinge cease.Perbrea∣kinge of black Co¦lera. But if the perbreakinge commeth of the black Colera / then set boxes of eche syde of hys necke. Of Fleg∣ma.But if it is caused of Flegma / then take Wormwod / Mugworte / Hirse or Millot vnstamped of eche foure vnces. Put all these into a litle sacke or
bagge / and quilte them so / that they cluster not / and seth them in halfe wine and half water / wringe it then out / that it droppe no more / and laye it then warme vpon hys brest: the same warmeth hys body and colde stomak / and alayeth the wambling and perkreakinge. It helpeth also a woman wyth chylde that hath ouermuche wamblinge. Also doth it helpe them that haue the stone engendred of colde / and must bowe themselues much / it doth also alaye grepinges. If the perbreaking commeth of colde / or els of cold and moyst humors / Perbrea∣kinge of colde. ether in a man or woman / then take Cumin / and make foure bagges / eche a span long and broade / put in eche of the bagges an vnce of Cumin / & quilt the same bagges croswyse / that the Cumin do not cluster / & seth the same in a quart of vinegre / & bind one of thē vpon eche wrest of the hande as warm as it may be suffred / & likewise vpon the wrast or ioynture of the fete. And whē they waxe cold / warme thē agayn in ye same liquor / wherin they were sodden / & lay thē vp agayn as before / & of this wyse ceaseth the perbreaking continently wythout daunger. And geue the patient a broth of gray peasen wherein Cumin is sodden / & let him drinke good strong drink / & let him put at euery breakfast a peny weight of beaten saffron therein / ye same cōforteth ye braynes & stomak / & refrayneth ye wambling or perbreakinge: but he must bewar of such thinges as coole him. Howbeit some cōplexions cā not away wyth saffron & abhorre it: for it causeth a lothsomnesse: let the same drincke water of Buglosse and Porcelene / thesame comforte the head also. But if the perbreaking would not holde vp / then make him a bagge of halfe an elle in length and bredth / and put therein Cumin / and dresse thesa∣me as is sayd before / seth it in vinegre / and laye it warme vpon the nauell / as warm as thou canst suffer it: and when it waxeth cold / warm it agayn: wyth thys is alayed the perbreakinge / and also doth thys wythstande the grepinge. But if one had a wamblinge / and did perbreake / and wist not for what cause / or whereby it commeth / let the same take the leaues of Quenches / & binde them vpon the wrast of the hādes / that alayeth it:Perbrea∣kynge vvhose cause is vnkno∣vven. the grener yt leaues be / the better be they. Yet if one would kepe thē in store for winter / let him pluck them of from the trees before our Ladyes day / the xv. day of August / and let them drye out of the Sonne. Agaynst perbreakinge take halfe an vnce of Betonye pouder / and two vnces of hony / make a confection therewyth / and geue the patiente thereof euerye daye fastinge. Medlers eaten / do wythstande perbreakinge / comfort the stomak / and refrayne wamblinge. I myselfe haue had a woman / whych was accustumed euery morning / to voyde at the mouth about two egges shelles full of vnclene slyme of clam¦my flegmatish matter: thesame was taught to take a certayne space euerye morninge a warme slyce of breade / rosted wyth salte / and that alayeth the perbreakinge. But if a man had eatē ought / or had slymy matter within him / & would fayne be ridde of it:To cause perbrea∣kinge. to cast the same out by perbreaking / let hym take white nisynge pouder / called Lingworte / aboute the thyrde parte of a dramme /
and vse it in a broth of peasen / and it shall continently breake from him. But if thou canst not haue Lingwort or Nising pouder / then take the roote of Elder / and pyll the vppermost shell of it when it is crene / washe it / and bay it in a morter / and geue hym it in a warme peasebroth. As for nising pouder belonged to strong complexioned folke to vse / and not ouer the weight that I haue aboue specifyed: For I was called by a man / that had taken nisinge pouder or Lingwort / a litle bag full / as is commenly sold / and had eatē the same / supposinge therewyth to driue awaye from hym / such fylth and slime / as he had in his stomak. And as sone as he had taken it / furthwyth had he suche a rage and grepyng wythin hym / that easely was sene the stomacke ryse vp and doune / euen to the necke / and a colde sweat brake out: so that he wened to dye straght waye: yea I my selfe iudged him dead also. But as sone as I toke an vnce of wyne / and a dramme (or the fourth part of an vn∣ce) of Castoreum / warmed and mixte together / and gaue him it / by and by was the wamblinge alayed. Of lyke wyse haue I sene a boye of eight yeares / eate the paringes of whyte isinge pouder / that were pilled from the roote by a Potekary / and when the chylde was brought to me / not knowynge what had happened / I aduised by my selfe / that the chylde had eaten Lingwort. For the sweate brake fearcely out / and it waxed pale / as if it wolde dye. Wherefore I gaue hym Castoreum / the bignesse of a filbert wyth a litle warme wyne / and con¦tinently was it hole / whych was euen at the poynt of death. A straunge Apotekary bad my seruaunt smell in a sagge / wherein was beaten Lingworte or nising pouder: and when he smelled therein / he thrust hys head into it / so that hys mouth and nose were full of it. Then ranne he vp and doune in the house / as though he should haue dyed. Wherfore I ga∣ue him stright waye fresh butter / and after that Castoreum wyth wyne / (as is sayd before) and he was healed incontinently. This haue I written / that simple folke maye beware of Lingworte or whyte nising pouder / with out it were proued before / wherfore the commune people knoweth not. Ly∣ke I my selfe haue sene a strange peddelapotecary minister to the commun people / that two or thre dyed of it. Therfore when one will vse them / he ou∣ght not to take aboue the weyght of twintye wheate cornes / wyth a whyt peaslbroth. Howbeit for the Lingworte maye be taken the rootes of Elder pilled / as is specifyed before. To cause to {per}brea¦ke vvith∣out paynWilt thou cause one to perbreake lightely wythout smarte or payn / take the sede of Orenge / seth that in water wythout salte / and put a litle oyle of nuttes thereto / and geue hym it wyth some course meate / and let him eate well / that the stomake maye be full. After yt geue him of the foresayde broth warme a good draught: after that let him laboure a litle / or els walke / vntil he be chafed / and then shall he perbreake and cast oute whatsoeur euill cor∣rupcion he hath in hys stomacke. The cou¦ghe and the cau∣ses there∣of.¶For the cough. MAnye wayes getteth a man the cough: somtyme of the brestes mistem∣peringe / somtyme of a matter that is inward or outwarde of the body.
If it be wythin / as it happeneth oft / that an humor falleth oute of the head into the brest / thesame is the worst to be healed.An hu∣mor in the brest If the cough commeth of heat / then is the brine rede / and this throte is drye and rough. To suche one ought be geuen barly potage wyth butter to be eaten / and Ptisana or Barly water to be droncken / wherin Lycoris is sodden. Geue him also to eat potage made wyth Lettis chapped and sod∣den in water / and after that well fryed in butter / thys taketh awaye he cough wythout payne. The cough that is engendred by colde / is knowen by the whytenesse of the brine. He that hath a feruent cough / let him take Neppe / that cattes delite in / so much as a Walnut / let him cut it smal and stampe it / and mae a taunsey thereof / wyth two egges beaten therein: let him eat this / and it shall make him whole. Thys taunsey maye he eate when he will / and is specially good for hym that hath a cough / caused of colde. Or els vse thys medicine: take wyne and oyle of oliue in like quantitye / put thesame into a cruyse / and seth it a litle / stere it together / and geue hym that to drinke / when he will go to bed / and in the morninge / so warm as he can suffer it: do thys two dayes one after another / and thys breaketh the running or morres / and softeneth the cough wythout hurte. It is also good for horsenesse / caused of colde. The cough doth also ouertake a man by reason of an euell humor engen¦dred in the liuer or the lightes / and so do fall into the brest:An hu∣mor in the liuer the same must be holpen of this wyse as shall folowe. Somtyme is the cough caused by foren or outwarde occassions as are smoke / euill vapors / stinking ayres / dust / colde drinkes / or of drinkinge cold when a man is chafed / or els when he drincketh / it falleth into the wronge throte.Outvvar de occa∣sions. The drye cough commeth somtyme / that ye patient hath an vnclene pul∣men or lightes & throte / & of fylthy matter / yt is assembled about ye pulmon & the gristels of ye pulmon in the cheste / & is waxē tough:Drye cough. wherby it cōmeth / yt a man can not cast it out / & getteth somtime a deadly aposteme. When it is now growē to an aposteme / then helpe him with syropes / as I shall teache you here after to mollifye it. Take also diligent hede whence the apostema∣cion commeth / yt therafter ye maye know how to cure him / and let this fo∣lowyng be the general cure. Take a whit cloth / wet ye same in cold water / & strayn it wel out again: thā winde it wel about yt patiētes throte.Cure ge∣nerall of apostems in the breste. After yt take another warm cloth / & wind also threfold about ye throte: thys do in ye morning / middaye / & at ni∣ght / & geue him thys syrop: Take a dishfull of brayded or beatē barlye / foure vnces of resnes / & xij. figges wel washē in warm water: put thē into a new pot / & take iiij. quartes of water / let thē seth halfe an hour. Thē strayn this / & put the drinke agayn into the pot / & cast into it sixe vnces of suger / lette it boyle ones / then take it of and stande to coole. Drinke of this when ye wil / specially in ye morning & euen to bedward. Thys moll fieth very wel / & cau∣seth to cast out / & maketh large about the brest: also doth it heal ye sorenesse & roughnesse of the throte. If it waxeth thicke / then put more water to it.
¶A drinke for the cough / for thyrste and roughnesse of the throte. TAke a quarte of water / put an vnce of suger therein / and seth the thirde part of it awaye / strayne it through & cloth / and let it coole / and drinke of it so muche thou listest. It is good also to washe thy mouth in the mor∣ninge and at none wyth warme water / and to rubbe thy teth: also to wash the forhead and temples wyth warme water / this clenseth and maketh the head lighte. ¶An other syrop for the cough and apostemacion in the breste and harte / whiche weakeneth and cau∣seth to caste oute. TAke Violettes a handfull / sixe leaues of Hartes tounge / put them in a clene cloth and in a pot / to thys putte a quarte and an halfe of water / seth it vntill the thyrde parte be sodden awaye: then presse it through a cloth into a clene pot / put thereto foure vnces and an halfe of suger / steare it well vntil the finger is all molten. Of thys mayest thou drinke when thou wilt. If the cough commeth of heat / then is the throte sore / and very dry / and the patient is very costyf. The cold ayer doth hym good / when he goeth in it: for he thynketh that his harte is refreshed and quickened. Thissame ou∣ght to be let blood in the Epatica or liuer vayne. But if it is not conueniente to let the same bloode / then marke whether hys cough be caused by a hote humor / and to what parte it floweth / and on that parte shall ye set boxes / for that is good. ¶For the hote cough. GEue him to drinke syrope of Violettes / to bedwarde / at nighte / in the morning / and els when ye will / wyth a litle blood warme wa¦ter. Thesame cooleth / mollisieth and causeth to cast out: it slaketh thyst / breaketh apostemacion / minisheth the cough / and comfor∣teth the drye and hote harte. ¶But when a man dyd cough / and were strayght aboute the brest and harte / and had heate therewyth / so that it were taken for an apo∣stemacion. TAkē a dishe full of Hempe sede / put thereto a litle warm water / braye it well / and strayne it wyth warme wa∣ter / so that it become as a thyn parage. After that when it is colde / geue the patient therof to drinke so muche as he listeth wythout hurte: the same doth mollifye & coole very well / slaketh thyrste / and maketh large aboute the harte. And it is hood to seth that hempsede milke wyth
butter / suppe there of wyth a spoune as hote as ye can suffre it / and in thre dayes ye shalbe whole without hurte or payne. It is good also for stich ab∣out the hart. But he that hath a consuming cough / and were greatly trauayled ther∣wyth / let hym eate at ones halfe a vnce of suger Benedicti.A consu∣mynge cough. Then let hym take thre hoopes of a vessell / the one alwaye greater then the other / & hang ouer them a couerled or tent cloth / tied to the roofe or plancher / in the forme of a bell dounwarde / and aboue narrowe / reachinge wythin a foote to the grounde. Vnder thesame set a stoole wyth a hole / but sitting vpon thesame / he maye not reache wyth hys head to the chayne or festeninge. Then take Malowes / Oerstrawe of eche a great handfull / and as much of herbe Va¦leriane / seth thesame in a kettel well couered. After that put them into two robbes / and put the one vnder the stoole wyth a hole / into the other set thy fete as hote as thou canst suffer it / and let the vapor strike vp into the and vpon the naked body / vntill thou be fallen into a sweat. If the tobbe vnder the stole doth cast no more vapor / then laye a hote flintstone therein / so ofte tyll thou be fallen in a sweat: and thys ought to be done in a warme cham∣ber / or hote house. Ye must not trauayl your self to muche / lest ye waxe to fe¦ble: and also if ye be fat / like ye haue a siege before ye attempt thys dry bath. When ye now do sweate well / then laye you doun vpon a bedde in ye cham∣ber or hote house: and if ye haue yet strength to sweate more / do so / for it is very good: for it weakeneth the harde matter / and maketh easye to be caste out / whereof the cough is engendred. After the bath must ye not go in the wynde / and remayne that nyght in the hote house / or some close chamber / and shoulde eat som thinge that geueth strength / and drinke good drinkes: the meat must be suche as nourisheth well / as are Oetmel gruel / Persely ro¦es / and suche lyke. This shall ye do thre dayes one after another / & ye cough shalbe mollifyed without grefe: and if he had a running in his head / wher∣by the congeled matter might be hindered to lose and breake / thys shal brea¦ke it / and voyde it. Take also oft in thy mouth the roote of the herbe called Pelitory of Spayne or Mustarde sede / chawe them / but swalowe thē not: that draweth much corruption doune. If the patient is stronge of comple∣xion / than put a litle Nisinge pouder into his nose / to drawe doune the euill humors / and beware of colde. He ought also holde hys mouth oft ouer a pott / wherein are sodden Ra∣pes or Nauets / that the hote breth or vapor maye go into his mouth / vntill hys face waxe reed / and he do sweate: and let him kepe himselfe warm ther¦vpon. Thus may he do lykewyse ouer a pott / wherin Appels or Peares are sodden wyth wyne / Ale or Bire. Item if ye will be ridde of the running / take ix. matches made of brim∣stone / put them into a pot stopped close / saue a litle hole / make thē to burne / hang a clock or some thing vpon thy head / open thy mouth wyde open ouer the pott / and receyue that breth or vapor into it: thys do in the morning and euening / and the running shall breake or fayde. ¶Thys folowynge is very good for the cough com∣mynge from the lightes.
Agaynst the cou∣gh cau∣sed of di∣seased li∣ghtes.Eate a potage made of wheate / water and butter: or els take a dishe¦full of pure and clene wheate / seth thesame in two quartes of watr / vntill the thyrd parte be sodden in. Thesame broth is good dronken for the cough / for it clenseth the pulme or lightes / and the pypes of thesame / whereof the cough commeth. A cough vvith gri¦pynge.He yt hath the greping in his body with the cough / or els shoulde get an apostemacion with the cough / let him take iiij. vnces of a black shepes wol / put ye same as warme vpō his body / as he cā suffer it / ii. tymes in yt day / in ye morning / at none & to bedward. That mollifieth yt matter / wherof ye cough is engendred / so yt he may voyd it / & taketh away the grypinge and cough. Cough of hu∣mors.But if ye cough did come of humors / descēding frō the head or other mē∣bres into ye brest or stomake / thē geue him this drink: Take hony the quanti¦tie of an egge / beate thesame with warme water / drinke it as warme as yu canst / in the morning and at euen: that alayeth the humours. Ye must be∣ware ye haue good sieges / lest ye get a greping therby. ¶Another drinke for the cough / that cooleth and mollifieth very well / and speciallye apostemes. A drinke for the cough.TAke Hempsede well beaten / mixte wyth water / and strayned through a cloth / so that it waxe euen as milk / drinke therof in the nyght and to¦ward night when ye are thyrstye. Or els take Rapes or Nauettes as much as a fyst / roste the same wel in ashes / yt they become as weke as a pere / ye reader they be / ye better are they: it greueth not though they be burnt somwhat. Thesame shall ye eate when ye go to bedde / as warm as ye can suffer it / and lykewyse in the morninge. This is good also for horsenesse. The rote of Iris or blewe floure delyce sodden in wyne / & dronke in the morning & at night / taketh awaye the costifnesse / & maketh large in ye brest. He yt cougheth / ought oft kepe his breth in / so long as he can: & if yt do not help him / then let him dayly blow ye fyre wt his mouth / & he waxeth whole: if yt do not helpe also / then let him eat rosted figges / wheron is strowed ye pou¦der of Nep or Catmint called in Latin Calamentū. But some vse nomore saue foure or fyue Pepper cornes / and chawe them / that taketh awaye the cough. ¶Of disease of the harte. Hartes disease.CArdiaca is a disease of trembling of the harte / when it trembleth / lea∣peth and beateth / by reason of the humors / that are gathered within the celles or felles that enuiron the harte: and this ouertaketh the patiente sodenlye / when the humors fall to neare the harte. If the humors are mixte with blood or colera / that causeth ouer greate heat / then trembleth the harte / and the patient waxeth feble / and thyrsteth very sore / and draweth hys breth heauely. If the humor be mixt with melancolike blood / then trembleth the hart / and the patient is werry / thyrsteth not / and is faynt: wherfore ought ye hart
be holpen furthwith / seynge it is the most noblest parte of man. If the hartes disease commeth of colerik blood / which is hote and drye / then must he be let blood in the leuer: or els (without the season do hinder it) geue him a drincke made of Cassia fistula / tempered wyth Borage water / Buglosse water / and Medewort water / called in Latin Melissa. But if the disease come of Melancolick blood / make him a siege wt Dia∣cartami thre quarters of an vnce in the morning / & let him walke wel vpon it. The third day geue him pilles de iera picra seuen in nombre to bedward: thesame clense the hart from fylth and noiaunce. It were good also to bath and sweate / yet not to whote / lest he waxe to feble. Somtyme commeth it of euill heat and moysture / and corrupt blood / & then doth he sweate sore. The same shall be let blood vpon the left hand in ye veyne of the lightes / and anoynte hym wyth Paulinum / and oyle of Vio∣lettes / and geue hym suger of Roses & light meates. Or els take a good tatt hen / yt hath ben killed ij. dayes before / yt she be tender: of thesame seth a quar¦ter very well wt water / in a pot wel closed and stopped / yt no breth can come out of it. Then take it out / & hold the quarter before the patientes mouth & nose / & the sauour therof shal comforte and strengthen him very wel / & lette him drinke a litle of the broth. But if the patient hath taken cold / then put a litle Cinamon in ye water to seth wyth ye henne / for yt geueth good warmth. Thys pot oft tyme ought to be putt in a stillitory / called Balneum Marie / mixt wyth ashes / and wel closed / and ought to seth thre houres / or more / vn¦till euery water be consumed: and marke well whan it is inough. If a man hath a stiche about the hart / if it cometh of blood / or a hote hu∣mor / or a fall or brusing / than geue him to drinke Endiue water / Pimpenell water / Moulbery water / or els Borage water.Stiche a∣bout the harte. If ye haue not the waters / then seth ye herbes with water / & drink it. Or els take Borage ye herbe / chap it smal / & dight it lyke a thycke potage / put butter therin & eate yt in the mor∣ning / yt is very good. Bugiosse is yet a more souerayne herbe to comfort the harte / dighted of this forsayd wyse: but ye Borage potage is good for ye stiche about the hart / specially if one maketh a potage therof with the herb of Da¦sye / ye helpeth wel / if a man were fallē or wounded: for it driueth awaye the euell blood / yt it auoyd from him wyth a siege. Also if a man haue any grefe or heuines about the hert: thē let him vse ye herbe / floures or root of Borage / or els the water distilled therof or sodden: for it comforteth the harte verye well / and maketh a man mery. ¶Of hartes feblenesse or fayntnesse. THat commeth thereby / whan the fylth is so encreased aboute it / that it can not expell and cast it from it.Faintnes of harte. Thys fylth is engendred by great sur∣feting and excesse / speciallye in such / as surfet & labour not / wherby their sto¦mak waxeth so full / yt it can not digest it. Or els if a man had eatē meat euel to digest / wherby the body is fylled wyth ouermuch wind / & the hart febe∣led / whereof man getteth manye diseases and inconueniences / as are scab∣bes / yushes or wheales / mattering sores / karnels and the canker. But if thys filling or repletion is in the stomak / yt marke therby: he bel∣keth or breketh much wind vpward / or perbreaketh / & hath payn in ye head.
Helpe thesame of this wyse: Purge hym wyth a drinke of pouder of Sene / geue him in the eueninge a quarter of an vnce of pouder of Sene / and in the morninge as much / wyth a pease broth blood warme / and that shal cau¦se him to haue a siege. The nexte day after / cause him to sweat in a bath / (if hys strength can suffer it) wt these herbes: Take Valerian / Popular / Hey∣sede and Ootestraw of eche a lyke / and geue him to eate broth and potages wyth a litle saffron / that comforteth the harte. If ye haue no saffron / then ta¦ke pouder of Buglosse / or els geue hym potage thereof to eate / or cause him to perbreake / and tye hys legges wyth litle cordes / thrust a squill dipped in oyle into hys throte / to cause him perbreake. Or els cause hym to perbreake wt Oken leaues / as I haue taught you before. Or els geue hym ten pennye weight of whyt nising pouder / if he can suffer it: Howbeit I wold not glad¦ly cōsel it / therfore beware alway of nising pouder / if yu canst forbeare it. The ma∣ners of voyding the bodyIt is to be noted / marked & knowē / ye great voyding & emptening of the body is by sieges / by perbreaking / blething at the nose / sweat / floures of wo¦mē / rūning sores / & by letting of blood / which is an abundant emptyninge / and weakeneth the body / chaungyng a man his color / & quenchyng his na∣turall heate / wherof then must the harte nedes waxe faynte / as well as of excesse of fyllinge or surffetty. Soudain alteraciōA rash or soudayne alteration from heate into colde / stoppeth ye sweate / and encloseth the fylth wythin the body / whereby a man waxeth faynt and feble. It fortuneth also yt a mās harte waxeth faynt of soudayn ioye / & yt hap¦peneth most to aged folke / whose nature cōsumeth. The harte also shrink to¦gether by reason of excessiue feare / heuinesse & mischange / or els by astōnish∣ment. For great ioy doth the harte so open it selfe / that the natural heat fay∣deth euen awaye / & then waxeth it cold and feble / that men do somtime dye for ouermuch ioye and gladnesse. Somtyme waxeth the harte faint / by rea¦son of the payne that other membres haue / for the payne striketh to ye harte / and troubleth the naturall course the body and entrayles. If nowe ye harte is faint by reason of great emptinesse / then let his face be cooled wt water / pul him by the nose / & scratch him about ye holow or pit of ye stomak. But if the emptinesse be in the vpper membres / then binde the ne∣thermost membres. Nota for vvarmīg and con∣fortynge the hart.It is to be noted / yt nothing is better for faintnesse of harte / thē yt a mā put hole saffrō in his drinke / & put alway a litle in his broth or potage: yt comfor∣teth the harte very well / & warmeth a man: lykewyse also doth Aqua vite / wherin is put hole saffrō & then dronke. Or els take euery day about one or two of ye clock at after none an egge / & rost it / yt the whyte ther of waxe a lit¦le hard: then take the yolke out of it / & put it into a dishe alone / and poure a good ladel full of fleshe broth / and put beaten saffron therein / as muche as though thou woldest salt an egge / put thereto also a litle salte / and drinke it then oute: that same is a greate comfortinge of the harte / and not only the harte / but also the whole body. Voidnes in the ne¦thermost mēbres.But if the voydnesse or emptinesse is in the nethermost membres / then tye hys vpper membres. And if his head do ake so sore therof / that he thinketh to be raging ther∣by / then helpe him of thys wyse: Bath him softelye / and he shall lyghtely
sweate. And yf he hath heate in the heade / then make hym thys: Take an vnce of oyle of Roses / vineagre halfe an vnce / beate thē well together / stra∣ke thys oft about hys heade / thys alayeth the heate and ragynge of ye hea∣de. Geue hym pilles de iera picra / and set hys fote oft in warm water / and rubbe them dounward. And when he taketh them out / then let hym rynsch them in colde water / and laye hym doune and rest: but let hym haue the so∣les of hys fete vncouerd / that the euel humors and heate may drawe doun∣warde towarde the fete. Geue hym to eate meates confortatiue: howbeit not to muche at once / vntyll he haue recouered strength. If he be a man / he must beware of women: for that shulde hurte hym. Yf ye feblenesse is come of heate or of vapor / helpe thesame of thys wyse:Faintnes of heate. Kepe him from anger or whote meates and from wyne / wythout it be very well alayed / and geue hym thys folowyng: Take the karnels of the Pom∣granate / and as muche Barley meel / mixe thesame together / and make a potage thereof / lett hym eate that. Thys cooleth the harte / and conforteth it: it is also good for the stomake that is ouerchafed. But yf ye can not haue Pomegranates / than take in steade thereof Berberis. If the faynenesse commeth by trouble and colde / thē geue him such thin¦ges as warme him / and bath him in warme water / to warme him natu∣rally / and let him drinke good wyne.Faintnes by trou∣ble and colde. Take also Saffron / Cinamon / Clo¦wes / of eche a quarter of an vnce / Suger two vnces / Aqua vite half an vn¦ce / water of Buglosse an vnce / whyte wyne a quarter of an vnce / put these together in a glasse / and let them stand a day and a nighte. After that drin∣ke thre morninges therof fastinge / that chafeth and warmeth the stomake / and comforteth the patient. And in hys meat ought he to put of the forsayd spices / and kepe him selfe warme / and beware of such thinges as coole. ¶Of all accidentes and diseases of the stomake / and howe it maye be healed. VVhan the stomake is full / and can not digest / it is to be marcked / whether the matter indigested commeth of superfluous eatinge and drinkinge:Of the ac¦cidences and disea¦ses of the stomack. Tokens of the e∣uill dige¦stion in the sto∣mack. for that weakeneth the stomake and hys naturall operacion. And these are the tokens / whereby it is knowen / whe∣ther the disease commeth therof: the vapors come out of the stomake / & clim vp into the head: or els is hys mouth bitter / and he is thyrsty / & hath greate payn in hys eyen. Somtyme commeth the disease by vnmeasurable and in∣ordinate eatinge of colde meetes / and thereby is the naturall operation of the stomake altered and weakened: and in the bottom of the stomacke en∣gendre euill humores / causinge that man can not digest. And these are ye sig∣nes whereby this is knowen: the vrine is whyte / thick and pale: aboue & in the midde is it clere / and in the bottom is it whyte as whey of milcke / syn∣ckinge and cleninge to the bottom as it were corrupt matter. The patiente hath greate payne in the kidneys and backbone toward the lefte syde. He hath also great colde in hys braynes / whych commeth thereby / that the sto∣mak and braynes be farre asunder / and the vapors drawe vp out of the sto¦make into the heade / and thereby is the colde of the braynes augmented.
If the stomake were full of euell humors / that are hote / and were enge∣dred of such hote meates / as are Garleke / Ouyons / Mustard / Pepper / and suche lyke / then are these the tokens of it: The paciente hath greate payne in the heade / he hath greate heate in the leuer / whyche is by reason of the hote meates that he hath eaten: for they inflamme the leuer / and consume hyr moysture. And if the paciente is of Sanguine or read Colera com∣plexion / and eate suche hote meates / then getteth he feruente heate / and burneth lyke fyre: he consumeth his naturall heate / and getteth an vn∣naturall heate in al his body / and at the last getteth he a feruente ague / cal∣led stinkinge febres / by reason the naturall heate and the natural moystnes which manteyn the body / are consumed. If the patiente is sycke of the heate / then muste he beware of all maner of hote meates / and that he eate not muche at ones / nor surfet. Hypocrates sayeth: Lyke to lyke / mistempereth the bodye: and therefore oughte colde meates be geuen hym / that is hote: and contrarywyse hoate meates to hym that is colde / to sette the bodye agayne in a frame. Therefore also is it conueniente to geue the patient lyghte meates of digestion / and colde / to re¦strayne the heate of the bloode and the read Colera. And if the disease were of flegma or black colera / or els of surffeting / thē must he be holpen of thys wyse: He ought not to eate nor drinke muche / but hys meates ought to be suche / as warme & comforte the stomak. He oughte also to eat cōfectes of quinches / made with quinches / suger / or cheries / or wt suger & appels: thesame augment and restore agayn naturall moysture. Item when a man hath hys stomake full of superfluous hote moysture / of saguin or reade Colera complexion: then must the euill humors be di∣gested and prepared wyth anye of these drinckes / whyche ye can best gett. Take Barlye halfe a pounde / thre quartes of water / and seth them to the fourth parte / then strayne it / and put therein the rootes of Succorye two vnces / Fenel rootes an vnce / Mayden heyre / Endyue of eche an vnce / the herbe Buglosse / the herbe Borage of eche half an vnce: poure ouer thys the foresayde Barly water / and seth the fourth parte awaye / and then strayne it agayne / put an vnce or an vnce and an halfe of suger to it / and geue the patient to drinke of it in the mornyng and euenynge. And when the mat∣ter beginneth to be ready / then purge the stomake of thys wyse: Take elec∣tuarium de succo Rosarum thre quarters of an vnce / a quarter of an vnce Diaprunis laxatiui / Cassie fistule extracte halfe an vnce / Hony of roses half an vnce / water of Buglosse / Borage and Endiue of eche thre quarters of an vnce. Mixe all this together / and geue ye patient the one half at euening / and the other in the morning in the dawning / let him walk vpon this / and not lye doune agayne vntill nyne or ten of the clocke: for assone as the hote moysture is prepared and digested / then is she easy to be caste oute / and wy¦ded. And if the patient sweat muche / then is it to be marked / that the bodye is full of superfluous humours: and wyth digestyng of the humours / accor¦ding to mans complexion / is he cured and made whole: and this aforemen∣cioned drinke and purgacion is the digestion and auoydinge of suche fylth. After that ought some conserues and Electuaries be ministred to him. The stomake doth somtyme wābel & is quasy by reason of a heate / that
is engendred by vndigested meates / or vnwholsom meates / and the vapor thereof beateth vp into the head. Thesame disease happeneth somtyme of rawe humors in the stomake / and if ye take the patient by the body / then is it outwardly weake / and yet feble. Geue to thesame in the morninge halfe an vnce of Diacarthami / or els geue him halfe an vnce of Electuarij de suc¦co rosarum: thesame clenseth the rough moysture out of the stomak. But if the stomak doth wamble of Melancoly / then is hys bodye hard and drye / when a man grypeth thereon. He that hath that disease / ought to anoynt the body wt oyle of oliue / wherin are sodden Fenkel sede or Kumin. If a man had some euell matter / vpon the mouth of the stomak / whiche he wolde gladly vomite out: or els dyd perceyue / he had muche slymy fylth within him / & wold fayne be rid therof by perbreakinge: or that his stomak did wamble: let him take grene Oken leafe in hys mouth / and chawe it. If ye can haue no grene leafe / then take a drye or seer oken leafe / and laye it in water / and then put it into thy mouth. Do this twise / thryse or foure times / and it shall drawe much slyme and fylth. And if he hath any matter within him / then doth he cast it out by perbreakinge. Or els take a litle springinge water / and vinegre of lyke quantitie / and drinke thereof as muche as an egge conteyneth. If a man had gotten vnlustynesse / that he had no appetite to meat / and waxeth heuy & faynt / nether can tell wherby it commeth / nor yet hath great heat:To auoy¦de quasi∣nesse and euell ap∣petite. then is nothing better for him / then that he take thre hennes egges in the morning / and let them be thorow warmed. After yt let him breake them vp / and take away the whyte therof / and suppe out the yolkes / and drinke therevpon a good draughte of wyne / and faste thereon vntill the eueninge / & walke somtyme: yt consumeth the euill humors / whych cause vnlustinesse. But if he had gotten this vnlustinesse after meate / then let him eate no more after that vntill the euen / and then lette him eate a thynne pappe of oetmeel / made wyth wine / and let him drincke litle / for that is good. And when he will go to bed / then let hys fete be rubbed wyth vinegre / wherein is sodden Wormwod: thys wil happely cast him in a sweate / that were ve∣ry good. If the vnlustinesse commeth by aduersitye and heuinesse / then is he ho∣lye dismade and heauy / and all what he doth / that greueth him. Thesame muste be cured of thys wyse: Lette him resorte oft wher myrth is vsed / and eate meates good of digestion / and in all hys meates lette a litle saffron be put: for that comforteth the harte / but it causeth vnluste in the stomacke / therefore oughte but a litle be put therein / yet causeth it good blood / and re∣ioyceth the harte. He that hath an vnmeasurable lust to meate or drinke / the same hath al∣so somtyme vnmeasurable sieges:Gredy∣nesse to meat and drinke. for the meat goeth oft from him not well digested / seynge the stomake nedeth not ouermuch meate / to digest well / & that it leaue not at the last euil humors. Thesame ought to drink good read wyne / and eat meates that do not ouerchafe the stomake. They that haue many cold humors in their stomake / let the same eat fas¦ting rawe onyons wyth salte and course breade.Cold hu¦mours in the sto∣make. Garlike doth also cōsume superfluous humors in the stomacke / and helpeth it to digeste: wherefore
it is good for labourers / that drinke much water / and eate colde meates: it driueth awaye also the dropsey. But if the stomack had ouermuch slymy humors in it / then oughte it he losed wyth Dacartami / or pilles of iera picra. But if it hath ouermuch heat then purge it wyth Electuarium de sucro rosarum / in the morninge / wyth a peasebreth. And after two or thre houres geue him yet peasebroth that is not salted nor sauoured / and let him walke / and not lye doune if he haue so muche strength. Ye maye also eate grene ginger agaynst a slymy stomake / the same warmeth it / and maketh digestion. Or els make a potage of yong Nettels / thesame warmeth the stomake / and consumeth euill humors in it / and causeth good digestion. Grene Calmus doth lykewise eaten in the mor¦ning and euening / and purgeth the stomack. But if it is in winter / then eate in the morning and eueninge Anis sede vpon breade / dipped in wyne / thesame clenseth the stomak from slyme / and maketh good digestion. S. Ihons beries called in Latine Berberis / slake thyrste / specially that commeth of Colera or the gal / and stoppe the flixe / and make appetite to eate and drinke: they be good for the quauering harte / re∣frayne vomitinge / and are good eaten agaynst blusters or reed pustuls / a∣gaynst the pestilence / speciallye when they are rype / stamped and strayned through a cloth / and sodden to the thycknesse of a pappe: kepe this through the whole yeare / and take therof a Walnut shell full at ones. ¶When a man can not sweat / or els sweateth ouermuche / howe that maye be caused / or refrayned. Of svvea¦tinge.SOme men sweat muche / and when they sweat not / then are they euill disposed / and fynde none other grefe nor disease anoynge thē. This sweate must be wythstande / or els maketh it the membres feable / and dryeth hym wythoute his knowledge. He that doth so sweat / be sure that it is a token that he is full of euill humors / wherwyth he is chafed and warmed / that he must nedes sweate.Cure. Thesame ought to be cu¦red of thys wyse: he must be purged / after that ye perceyue hys complexion: and when he is in purgynge / make hym a bath / to drawe furth suche hu∣mors of ths wyse: Take a pounde of Gentiane rootes / slyce them as small as grotes / putte them into a litle bagge / put thereto two vnces of salt / and eyght quartes of water / and let the Gentian be well sodden: and if thou nedest more water / take more of the fyrste water. In thys bathe let him bath sixe houres in the morning fresh and fasting / or according as he can suffre it. And if he would gladly eate or drinke / let him boldely eat a suppe / and drinke ones / to make hym stronge. When he hath now bathed ynough / then let him lye doune to bedde / and rest or slepe well: and if a sweate came vpon him / withoute pro∣curinge / that were very good for hym / and that he might euen so rest or sle∣pe a litle. Then let hym eate that / wherto his minde standeth best / whether it be Chekens or Pollets sodden or rosted / Ryss potage and other good po∣tages. He must be sober in eatinge and drinkinge / lest he take a surffet / and the stomake be stopped / whereof is caused a lothsomnesse to hys meat / and
consequently the yalow iayndes or other disease / for the whiche he nedeth not to bath any more. ¶Of sweatynge. ONe maner of sweate is naturall / the other vnnaturall.Tvvo ma¦ner of svveates naturall and vn∣naturall. The naturall sweat commeth by it self / so that a man sweateth ouer all his bodye / and se that his nethermost partes are warme / and that his sweat is warm / and that man waxeth not faynte of it / ye he resteth better after it / and is ly∣ghter than before. This is a token / that that man hath many humors with in hym / and that hys nature is so stronge / that it can expell and dryue oute thesame humors / and therfore is sweatinge for suche one. They are also na∣turall sweates / when a man goeth in hote houses that are not ouer whore / and that man doth than beginne to sweate: or els when one batheth in wa¦ters that are not ouer hote / and that he beginneth then to sweate aboute the head and eyen. Thys ought not to be refrayned / for it is wholsome. Or els is it a naturall sweate / when a man laboureth measurably / and is not so sore chafed therewyth. All these are good and holsome / for they driue a∣waye from man the superfluous humors. The vnnaturall or euell sweate is it / that commeth towarde the eue∣nynge / and is colde / and waltereth only about the harte. Thesame though it be not good / yet is it not so greately to be wythstande. But when a man hath a greate disease or feblenesse / and a colde sweate breaketh oute onely aboute the nose / that is a very deadlye signe / specially when the nosethrilles open and close fearcely / and the nose waxeth sharpe.Tokens of death. But when he sweateth onely aboute the harte / that is somtyme a to∣ken that a man is verye contrarye to hys nature / and that the heate is in∣warde in hys bodye / and nature oute of frame / and the pories (whyche are the issues of the sweate) stopped / whereby nature is not stronge in∣ough to dryue oute the sweate through the skynne. Besyde thys are those naturall sweates / when men sweate muche euerye daye: and that cometh thereby / that men haue ouermuche moystnesse or humors wythin thē / and that must be abated then and letted. These thynges cause to sweate wythoute daunger: The floures and herbe of Camomille / or els Malowes / putte them into a close tobbe / and make a bath so / that the vapor maye stryke vp into the.Thinges causyng to svveat And suche a bath is good for them / that will not gladlye wet theyr fete. Lyke vertue also hath Fenell / Penyreal / the floures of Hoppes / Branck vrsyne the toppets of the floure / Saluye or Sage wyth the floure / Smalage / and wild Clarye / cal∣led otherwyse Oculus Christi. ¶A good bathe for them that haue taken colde. Of thys wyse oughte they be bathed drye / whyche haue taken colde /
before they do bath in water: Take Mugworte / Sauge / Fenel / Penyreal / of eche a hand full / chappe them small / and put them into two bagges / seth them well / also make a sweating therewyth wen ye will bath. And when ye will bath / then wet a long cloth in colde lye / wringe it well oute / and tye it about thy head. Then put the water that the herbes haue ben sodden in / into a to / and set thy fete therein / as hote as ye can suffre it / and lay one of the bagges vnder you / and sitte thereon / and laye the other vpon youre sto∣macke / retchynge doune tyll youre priuye membres: but looke ye bathe not to hote. Floures causyng to svveatThese floures cause sweatinge also: The floures of Almondes / Cheris / Violets / Langedbeiff / Whyte poppy / Whyte lyllyes / Benes / Cocles / great Malowes / or Holy hockes / Filbertes / Blewlyllyes / or Appels. Of these flou¦res maye ye seth some in water / to make a sweatinge bath / or els seth them in a bagge / and presse it well oute / and laye it as hote vpon your body as ye can suffre it / and tye an other bagge aboute thy fete / for that shall cause you to sweate so muche the soner and wythoute hurte. Svveatīg herbes hote of cōplexiōThese herbes folowynge are of warme complexion / and cause him that is colde of complexion to sweate lightely: Take Penyreal / Lauender flou∣res / Mustarde floures / Cousloppes / Sauge / Mugwort / the floures of Ele∣campane / the leaues of Lorel or Baye / Selandine or the floures of it / and Fitches: all these / or part of them may ye seth in half water halfe wyne / and mayest prouoke sweat therewyth / as is sayde. Herbes causinge to svveat lightely.These herbes cause to sweate lyghtely: Malowes / Holyhockes / Brank∣vrsine / Houndes tonge / the rotes of whyte lillies / Longeworte growynge by Okentrees / Louage / Pelitory of the wall / Millefoyle / the herbe of Vio∣lettes / Lettis and the floures of Hathorne. To svvet easely.Thys folowyng causeth to sweat easely / nother nedeth a man to be co∣uered therefore the more: Take the leaues and floures of Elder tre / the lea∣ues of Lilies / of eche two handful / put the same vnder the patientes shites / and let hym lye vpon hys back vpon the herbes / if he fall a slepe there on / he shall sweate. An oint∣mente to cause to svveate.Thys folowyng causeth to sweate also: Seth Nettels in oyle of nuttes / anoynt hym well therewyth at night / that it maye strike in through ye skin / and after hys slepe toward the morning shal he fal in a sweate. Also if a mā taketh Rue or herbe grace / Salt and vinegre / and rub the patients hands inwardly / and the soles of his fete / whan he will go to bed / in the morninge after his slepe shall he fall to sweatinge. Thys also causeth to sweate: Take a white and harde dogges dounge / braye and syft thesame through a cloth / of that take as muche as a Filberts shell can conteyne / putte to thesame as muche Oetmeel as two egges can holde / and a dish full of Vinegre / and foure tymes as much water: make of thys a thynne broth / and geue it the patient to suppe to bedwarde / and he shall sweat continently: and that sweating is souerayne good for them that haue feruent heate / as in a pestilence or feruent ague. A bath to make fruitfull.If ye will make a good naturall bath / that chafeth and warmeth well / and warmeth also baren women / that they become fruytefull: Take thre quartes of the rootes of Sloes / or sixe good handfulles / cut them smal / and
seth them vntill the water waxeth reade: put thereto a pounde of Alume / and halfe a pounde of Brimstone beaten to pouder / but lette these be put or tyed in a cloth. Ye must knowe also / that if a woman were sore colde / then take twyse as manye rootes / nether must anye other water be putte thereto / then the same that is sodden wyth the thre forsayde thynges. It is good also to put thre hande full of salte into the kettel where they are boyled. And she muste beware of takinge colde / and vse meates that warme. If the man be colde of complexion / then muste he bath therein also / for the woman becommeth so muche the more fruytefull: for when a man ba∣theth wyth a baren woman / they waxe so muche the more abler / and she the more fruytefull. It were good to take the foresayde rootes of Slos / as muche grene flaxe wyth the rootes chapped small / and bounde toge∣ther in a bagge / and than laye that bagge behynde vpon the womannis backe / as warme as she can suffre it: and whan the bagge waxeth colde / to warme it agayne in the forsayde water / and laye it agayne to hyr bo∣dye in the bath. Thys muste be done ofte / for there wyth is hyr matrice or mother chafed / and made apte to conceyue and be fruytefull. ¶Howe a man maye be restored agayne that hath lost hys strength by sycknesse. IF a man were become verye weake and feable by reason of a longe sycknesse / euen that he semeth to be consumed / A resto∣ringe of mans na∣turall strength nether can recouer / then take twentye olde cockes / dresse and dighte them as though they shoulde be eaten / seth them in the thyrde parte of a tonne of water / stampe them in a morter / so that the bones be al to brused and make a bath therewyth / and let hym bathe therein. When he hath ba∣thed inough / laye him to bed / and reste. Or els bath hym in Ferne or brake / for that restoreth ye senowes to their former strength / and comforteth the patient. The Ferne ought to be chap∣ped small / and put into a bagge / and to a meane basket ful / must ye take the thyrde parte of a tonne of water. Thys bath folowynge is good for them that haue ben longe sycke / or whose mary in the bones is corrupt / or els their bloode in the veynes is cor∣rupt and become noughte / by reason of colde:Another restorīge bath. for it is a stronge bath / and is the bath of Maister William of Vallis. Take Sauge / Rue / Wormwoode / Betonye / Reed mynte / the rootes of Nettels / Wylde Mergerum / Mugworte / the herbe of Strawber∣ryes / the sede of Nettels / Louage / Iuniper / whereon are manye ber∣ryes or cornes / of eche a hande full. Chappe all these small / and put them in two bagges / put to them halfe a pound of Bayeberyes / and a pounde of beaten Brimstone / parte them (I saye) into two bagges / and seth them well in water / as muche as is conuenient / and bath thre dayes therein / nether putte anye more water thereto / and bath in the morninge fas∣tynge / so longe as ye can endure it. After that seeth the other bagge
also / and do as before: thesame strengtheth the lymmes / and geueth them force. ¶A good drinke that strengtheth the hart and all the mem¦bres / if a man drinke halfe an egges shale full in the morninge and eueninge / wyth as muche good wyne. A drinke to stren∣gthen a man.TAke the beste Aqua vite that ye can gette / take also a pece of fyne golde / make it gloynge whote ix. tymes / and quenche it agayne / the more ye quenche it / the stronger waxeth the water and bet∣ter / put into thesame Aqua vite half a quarter of an vnce of saffrō / and a quarter of an vnce of Cinamon both beaten / let them stand four day∣es well stopped / and steare it euery daye ones / but when thou wilt take it / then let it stande still vnstered / that it maye be clere. Thys water warmeth the colde stomacke / geueth strength to all the membres / speciallye to aged folke / that haue ben ouerlonge sycke / whose strength is consumed: for it cō∣forteth and strengtheth the hart out of measur. ¶Another drinke comfortinge the body and purginge. A drinke cōfortīg the bodyTAke two vnces of Aqua vite / nisynge pouder a quarter of an vnce / let them stande fourten dayes. After that presse it out through a fylte / and take therof euermore fastinge a quarter of an vnce wyth an vnce of wine. But if ye will refreshe the body / then take a quarter of an vnce of iera pi¦cra / and laye it in Aqua vite as before / and drinke thereof fasting thre drop∣pes / and take a litle in your hande / and put and rubbe it into your nose / and drawe the sent ther of vp into your heade. The water of Buglosse dronken / is good for them that be sycke at the harte / or els the water stilled wyth an olde henne / thesame geue him to drinke that hath lyen long sycke / and is fe∣ble: for it geueth hym good strength / and it must be taken in the mornynge and eueninge. These meates strengthen well the forsayde diseased / namely / Hartes fe∣te / Does fete / Bulles fete / or any ruder beastes fete. The elder these beastes be / the more do they strengthen / and they must be sodden so long / till the bo∣nes fall from the fleshe / and strowe beaten Saffron vpon them. ¶Item a good bath and naturall / for it draweth furth euil heat / and strengtheneth well. A bath to dravv out euil heat and to stren∣gthen.TAke Heeth or Lynge / Penyreal / Wormwood / Sauge / Fenel / of eche a handfull / put it into a bagge / and laye it into a kettel that it maye be thorow hote. And whan ye bathe / than sit vpon the bagge: howbeit ye nede not to put it agayne into the kettel / for the water should waxe to stronge. ¶A verye holsome confection to strengthen a diseased of the foresayd sycknesse.
TAke the best Grapes that ye can get / putte them into a kettel / stampe them / and make wyne of them:A confe∣ction to strēgthē. seth that well aboute an houre / steare it / and strayne it through a copper strayner / after that strayne it through a fyner strayner / and seth it agayne / that it waxe as thycke as a thyck pappe / and steare it tyll it be colde / cutte it than to small peces / and putte it into a pot that is glased / and then is it made redy.

Kowe mylcke and Rice sodden together / strengtheneth verye well / or els a thycke potage made of grene Persely and fleshe / or els wyth Perselye and a good Hennes broth: thesame strengthen very well:Meates strēgthe∣ninge. Lykewyse doth the mary of Hertes / Roes or rudder beastes / drawen out of the bones / sod∣den and eaten. If a man were wholy febled and abated / and coulde take no maner of sustenaunce / it were good for hym to drinke warme woman milke / or els to sucke a woman / speciallye in the morninge:Another to stren∣gthen. thesame doth strengthen and comforte the harte very sore and all the membres / and causeth good blood: But if he could eate fleshe dighted wyth the floures of Borage / that were a souerayne thynge.

MAny diseases come from the Lyuer / as Stopping / Rottinge / Diseases caused by the lyuer. In∣flammation / the Yalow iaundis / the Dropsy commeth also there by / that the Lyuer can not digest / and that bloode that she should
sende into the membres / is turned to water: the membres are out of theyr frame / and haue no due operacion / by reason of the Lyuers disease / that is / that the veynes comminge from the lyuer to the stomacke / do geue euell heate: Thesame heate dryeth or seereth the stomake / so that he getteth luste to drinke colde water / and that causeth the stomake to digest euill / and cau∣seth dropsey. For the lust of colde water / weakeneth the digestion wholye / and the bloode that the lyuer shoulde sende to the vrines / is mixte wyth cold water / by reason of the indigestion / and so is parted through out al the membres / and therof swelleth man / and getteth the dropsey. Of the Splene.Otherwyse commeth thys disease of the Splene / that it can not digest the substaunce / whyche the Lyuer hath ministred and sent to hym / and that is Colera nigra: thesame bloode dothe mixe it selfe farther into the other membres / and thereof swelleth a man. Of the kidneys.Somtyme is it occasyoned of the Kydneys / or that a man bledth to muche at the nose / or somtyme that a man is to muche bounde in hys bel∣lye / and can haue no sieges. Somtyme of superfluous bloode / whyche lyeth hardened and vndiges∣ted in the lyuer / thesame doth mixe it selfe into all the membres / and cau∣seth them to swell. Remedy for the lyuer.He that is diseased in the Lyuer / helpe hym of thys wyse: Let hym be∣ware of all meates chafynge or whote of complexion: for chafynge meates to scaulde the lyuer / and bringe it oute of hys complexion. Wherefore it is requisyte to set the Lyuer agayne into hys former digestiue power / wyth medicines competente to it: that is / that she be purged of Colera / Blood / and black Colera.A confe∣ction to mollifye diseases. It is reason and requisyte in all diseases / to mol∣lifye the disease / wyth thys syrop or confection / before a purgation be mini∣stred to hym. Take the rootes of Fenel / Percelye / of eche a handfull: the herbe and rootes of Walworte and Valeriane / of eche an vnce: the sedes of Fenel and Anis of eche halfe an vnce: water two or thre quartes. Bruse the rootes / and let them all stande stypinge a nyghte / and geue the pacient to drincke there of in the mornynge and euenynge / at euerye tyme thre vnces / mixte wyth water of the floures of Eldren or Boure tre / and after that purge hym wyth Dia prunis laxatiuo / an vnce at ones / and that shoulde be minis¦tred to hym after hys fyrste slepe / and he maye slepe safely there vpon. Item to purge one easely / wythout daunger / that hath a hoate disease / in a chafed Lyuer of a whote ague or other disease / geue hym in the mor∣nynge halfe an vnce of Electuarium de succo rosarum / thre quarters of an vnce Cassie fistule extracte / water of Endiue / the water of Colander or Maydens heyre / of eche an vnce and an halfe: mixe them together / and ge∣ue hym it in the mornynge / but he maye not slepe there vpon. Geue hym for a confortatiue Diarrhodon abbatis. Walwort dronken refrayneth the waterish moysture in the bellye. Nothynge is better in the worlde for the Dropsye / then to drincke the iuyce of Blewlillies rootes an vnce or an halfe / wyth two vnces of whay: or els the roote sodden wyth wyne / and droncke in the euenynge and mor∣nynge
/ thesame enlargeth the brest / and taketh awaye fetching of the breth wyth payne / wherwyth they that haue the dropsy / are payned. ¶Of the yalow iaundis. ICtericia is the yalow Iaundis / and alteracion of ye naturall color of the skinne into a yalow colour.Of the yalovve Iaundis and the causes thereof. Thesame commeth somtyme from the Ly∣uer / somtyme from the Galle / somtyme from the Splene. The iaundis commynge from the Lyuer / is caused two wayes: ether by mistemperat∣nesse of heate / or by stoppynge in the lyuer. The iaundis caused by mistem∣peraunce of heate / is of two sortes: somtyme wyth apostemacion / som∣tyme wythoute apostemacion. But if the iaundis commeth by a waysting wyth apostemacion / then are the signes in a man strengthynge / trembling and a payne in the ryghte syde / a consumpcion of the whole bodye / and minishynge of the strengthe and the digestion / the water is as reade as bloode. The iaundis wythoute apostemacion hath no consumpcion / streyn∣gthynge / nor tremblynge / and they haue also the commune token of ya∣lownesse in theyr eyes / the face yalowe / pale or grene / the water reade and bloodye. Fyrste ought medicine to be geuen for the apostemacion / if the iaundis is wyth an apostemacion / that it be fyrste taken awaye / after that shalbe ta¦ken awaye the waystinge comming by the heate. ¶A true medicine for the Iaundis. TAke a handfull of Cherye leaues / seeth them in a pinte of milcke / that it boyle well / strayne it / and drincke a good draught thereof to bedde∣warde and in the mornynge fastynge / and the iaundis shall auoyde from you by siege. Or els drinke in the morninge and euenyng thys folowyng: Take the wood of Berberis / pyll the vpper shell wyth the leaues from it / and take the seconde shell that is yelowe: putte thereof as muche as a wal∣nut in a cloth / and seth it wyth a pinte of water / that it be well boyled / and let it coole / and then drinke it. This hath ben experimented / put thereof also in thy drinke. ¶Agaynste the desperate iaundis. TAke two handfull of the roote of blewe Lilies / cutte them small / and seeth them in thre quartes of water foure houres longe: and when he will go to bed / wett a fyne shete therein / that it be well wett / folde it toge∣ther / and wynde it all ouer and ouer the pacientes body / euen the head al∣so / when he goeth to bed. If he sweate / then draweth the iaundis into the shete / and waxeth yalowe. Hym that the yalow iaundis taketh / is wel perceyued by hys eyes / han¦des / soles of the fete / and the yalow colour of the whole body.
¶Agaynst the iaundis that is rooted. TAke Celidony both the herbe and roote / chappe it smal / and when ye haue a pottel thereof / seeth it in water / and let it be well coue∣red / that no vapor maye go oute / and make therewyth a swea∣tynge bath / and if ye sweate well / the iaundis shall auoyde by it. ¶Another true and hurtlesse science for the iaundis. TAke the sede of Ancolie or Accolie beaten to pouder / a quarter of an vn¦ce / put thereto beaten saffron a peny weyght / and an vnce of vinegre / and two vnces of water of Celidony / steare them well together: thesame shoulde be dronken fastynge or to bedwarde / and drinke not after it. The same driueth out the iaundis by the vrine harmelesse. In the mornynge draughte putte suger / that maketh it good. It maye also be mixte wyth as muche Southisteen water / as maye be droncke at ones: or take the floure of Cichore and rootes / and seth them in half wyne / halfe water / and drinke therof fastynge / and at euen. ¶Yet another medicine for the iaundis that is rooted / or els hath infect the eyes and skinne. TAke the herbe of holes / burne it to ashes / and of them make a lye / and wash thy therewyth: wet also a cloth therein / and winde it warme ab∣out thy heade to bedwarde: do this eight dayes continually / and the iaun∣dis shalbe drawen into the cloth through the heade. ¶Another true medicine for the iaundis. BEat the carnels of Peaches small / put vinegre thereto / so muche that it waxe a thynne broth / drinke that what tyme ye will / & spe∣cially fasting / or to bedwarde / but ye maye not drinke after it: that breaketh the iaundis / lykewyse do the carnels of wild Almondes. Iaundis vvith cos¦ifnesse.If one had the iaundis / and were so bounde in hys belly / that he coulde haue no sieges / then make him thys solutorye. Marke whether he haue a heate / then geue hym to bedwarde halfe an vnce of Viol syrop / wyth as muche colde water / and geue hym in the mornynge halfe an vnce of Elec∣tuarium de succo rosarum / tempered wyth a warme Hennes broth / or a broth of Calues fleshe / or els a broth of whyte Peasen / and let him drinke a good draught after that. But if the heate nor bitternesse wold go awaye / then geue hym fasting a quarter of an vnce of Rebarbara / wyth an vnce and an halfe of water of Moulberryes / and the next daye let hym blood in the Lyuer veyne / and let hym beware of all meates that warme. Geue hym somtyme warme water into hys mouth / to washe it there wyth / and afterward cold water / to ren∣sche it: do thys in the morninge / and let hym wesh his handes lykewyse. Or els let him drincke distilled water of Hertes tounge / or the herbe sodden in
water / thesame is good dronken agaynst the iaundes / for the heat of the ly∣uer. Or els take the pouder of Ancolye sede / and beaten saffron / of eche a pe¦ny weight / and halfe an egges shale full of wyne / and as much water / and as muche vinegre: mixe these v. together / and drinke that to bedward / and in the morning fastinge: thys helpeth very well / and is experimented. ¶A good pouder for the iaundis. TAke the skinne of a Hennes mawe / washe it fayre wyth wyne / drye it / and make it to pouder.A pou∣der for the iaun∣dis. And when thou wilt ryse from the borde or sup¦per / then suppe a pece of bread in wyne / and put of that pouder theron / and eate it to bedwarde / and in the morninge fasting: thys is a souerayne thing for the iaundis in the stomak. Or els take earth wormes so much as halfe a walnutt / cut them small / and braye them wyth a litle wine or water / so that ye may swalow it: drin∣ke the same fasting / and hold a slyce of bread tosted with salt warme before thy mouth / and drinke Endiue water therevpon: mixe wine also and wa∣ter of Endiue together / and drinke that to bedward. He that hath the iaundis vpon the tonge / or that his toung were drye or hote / let him take Psyllium / that is to saye Fleewort / as great as a Filbert / let him put it in a fyne cloth / and laye it in warme water thre houres long: after that let him strake hys tounge therwyth otherwhyles / thesame dra∣weth out the euill heate / cooleth the tounge / and taketh awaye the bitter∣nesse. Lykewyse doth Sauge layde in colde water / and layeth alwaye a freshe leafe thereof on it. A Plantayne leafe layd in colde water / and so laid wett vpon the tounge / do lykewyse: for it cooleth the mouth / and taketh a∣waye the bitternesse. But if it were winter / and ye could not haue the her∣bes: then take litle flynte stones / laye them in water / and do as is sayde be∣fore. He that hath the iaundis so feruently and sore / that he can nether tayste nor drinke wyne or good drinke: let thesame drinke Barley water at all ty∣mes / for that alayeth the heate of the iaundis and gall / and nourisheth wel. And if he can eate no meate / yet let him eate a pappe of Barly sodden wyth water and butter / and let hym vse that / vntill he can eate other meate: and let hym drinke also water of Lillies / or Isop / or Buglosse. There is an herbe called Herbe of iaundis / it is so right grene as grasse / and hath a longe stalke / and longe leaues / fashioned lyke Esula / saue that it hath no milcke / as Esula doth. Of thys herbe take a hand full / and a quart of water / seth them well: of thys water let the patient drink in the morning and eueninge / and temper hys drinke therewyth: thesame breaketh and dri¦ueth awaye the iaundis sore wythout grefe / so that it is perceyued in the v∣rine. Or els take the sede of Ancolye or Accolye the weight of twinty whea¦ten cornes / mixt wyth two egges shalesfull wyne / drinke thesame fastinge in the morninge / and as muche to bedwarde: thesame driueth the iaundis strayghtwaye from you in the vrine. If the iaundis were rotted in a man / and had therewyth heat / thyrste & a stiche / then take his shyrte or smoke / and wett it in his oune vrine or cham¦berlye
/ wringe it well out / put it on hym agayne / laye him agayne to bedde / and couer him warme: then draweth the iaundis out into his shyrt or smo∣ke / and his skin and smoke shalbe as yelowe as a quenche: and this must he do thryse. Thys maye be done also / if the lyuer were inflamed. It is good also for the iaundis / to strake the weast of the handes verye well wyth warme wyne / in the morning / at none / and eueninge: for it dra∣weth the iaundis from the stomake. ¶Of the diseases of the Lyuer. ¶Of inflamacion of the Liuer. Inflāma∣ciō of the lyuer.SOmtyme is the Lyuer diseased of hys oune faute or vice: somtyme also by other membres. When it is diseased of it selfe / that is somtyme of heat or colde / somtyme of superfluous moysture / or els of dryenesse or droughte / where of the lyuer and bladder get great hurte. When it is so diseased / then let the patiente at the lyuer veyne in the arme: or els lette hym bloode in the small toe of the ryghte foote. But if he hath eaten / then lette hym blood by the litle finger vpon the hande / and geue hym to drinke barley water. Let hym eate no fleshe / nor chafynge or inflamynge meate / no salte meate / none olde baken breade / no egges / nor none vndigestible meates. ¶A good pouder for the hote lyuer / hote stomake and for the hote ague. A pou∣der for invvarde heate.TAke fyue vnces of beaten or grounde barlye / mixte wyth Endiue water / put thereto an vnce and an halfe beaten Coriander / stiped before in Vinegre / and a quarter of an vnce of Anis sede beaten / foure vnces of suger: the same must be eaten wyth breade / dipped in wyne in the morninge fastinge / after meate / and to bedwarde: it causeth also an appetite. Ye maye geue him also onfect of Cheries in the morninge / and let him fast thereon sixe houres. Geue him Sorel iuyce to drincke / thesame cooleth / and alayeth the heat of the lyuer and thyrste / or els geue hym water dis∣telled of Sorell / thesame cooleth and alayeth the thyrste wythoute daun∣ger. ¶When the Lyuer is inflamed. Inflāma∣ciō of the liuer and the reme¦dy ther∣of.VVhen the lyuer is inflammed / take Oken leaues / make thereof square pyllous / as greate as a heade / and laye one to the ryghte syde: and when thesame waxeth hote / take it awaye / and laye an other that is freshe thereon. Thys maye ye do day and nyght / and that draweth the euell heate out / cooleth the lyuer naturally. Or els wett a cannefas in Endiue water / wringe it out / and laye it vpon the lyuer. Eate also the Lyuerworte that groweth in moystye marishes or standinge wa∣ters / and drincke of it. Ye muste beware of anger and sorowe / and
when ye will eate or take of refection / then rubbe youre tounge and tethe / and after that washe them well wyth cold water. In the mornynge / none and euenynge set youre fete in warme water and warme them therein: af∣ter that put them sodenly in colde water / and then laye you doune with the soles of your fete vncouered / for then draweth the euill heate after the cold / and comforteth you. He that hath a diseased lyuer of a colde complexion can eate muche bet∣ter / then he that is diseased of a warme complexion / & yet can not he digeste it. He hath greate stiches in hys ryght syde / and hys face chaungeth sore:Marke thys. his lippes and tounges waxe whyte / and he waxeth pale vnder hys eyen / hys blood minisheth / his vrine is pale / clere or whyte / and a litle scomminge. It is good to purge thesame wyth Rebarbara / and to anoynte hys lyuer wih oyle of Nardus / and oyle of Dyll / of lyke quantitie. Or els geue hym to eat raysins / and suche meates as chafe hym: but let hym beware of swete mea∣tes / for they hurt the lyuer and splene. Sette hys fete also in warme water / wherein Camomille is sodden / let him warme them well therein / and be∣ware for takinge colde: for that doth hurte. Wormwoode in meate cōforteth and warmeth the stomake and liuer / and causeth lust to eat / it healeth also the stoppinge of the liuer / as in the ya∣lowe iaundis and dropsye. For thys vse maye ye drye it / make it to pouder / and eate thereof in the morning / at none and at eueninge / at euery tyme so muche as a chest nutt. Lette hym eate Rice potage / and Ciche peasen sod∣den / that the uske be taken awaye. Lette hym also eate the broth of a pol∣let / wherein whyte breade is stiped. Somtime is the liuer diseased of ouermuch moystnes / thesame doth his Splene swel / & his vrine waxeth as whyte and clere as water / he hath also payne in hys loynes / and specially in the left syde:Liuer di∣seased of ouermu∣ch moist∣nesse and the tokēs of it. he is not a thyrst / he is he∣uy minded / his stomake wambleth by reason of stopping of hys lyuer. Somtyme is the lyuer stopped by reason of drye blood / whyche can not flowe nor haue course through the other veynes / as it should do: because of hys grosnesse and thycknesse. It is stopped also by other humore / that are grosse and slymye / of the whych it hath gotten theyr nature and qualitye. Somtyme is the lyuer stopped by reason any member hath not his due course / because it is cut of or mamed / & the bloode passinge through thesame from the lyuer / is stopped / and so remayneth it in the lyuer. Those that be so diseased / ought ye to purge wyth pilles of Iera pira / and let him blood in ye liuer veyne in the arme: and after eight dayes / vpon ye right hande betwene the litle finger and the nexte / and geue him to eat meates that coole / & drin∣ke small drinkes. He ought also at the fyrst to be let blood in the Median in the arme / and geue him to eate suger of Roses. ¶Somtyme is the lyuer of a woman stopped / when hyr floures drawe vpwarde / before it is due season. SHe that is in suche a case / that hyr liuer is stopped / because hyr flou∣res are stayed before tyme conueniente / thesame oughte to be lette
blood continently at both the fete / and to purge her all maner of wayes / as it perteyneth women / whose floures are stopped / as it is shewed hereafter. Geue hyr pilles of iera picra / the fyrst night thre / the seconde night fyue / the thyrde night seuen: this is the best recept for them / for they purge hyr well. And thys shoulde be ministred to them furthwyth: for if it be delayed / then is it greuous to ayde them / whych neuerthelesse is easye at the fyrste. ¶Of Apostemation of the Liuer. Aposte∣matiō of the liuerSOmtyme groweth an aposteme in the Lyuer / by reason a man is fallen / beaten or striken vpon it: somtime because a moysture is ga¦thered in it: somtyme of an euill heate / that is gathered in the sto∣make of vndigested meates. The diseases or apostemes of the liuer / are somtyme vpon it / and then ri∣seth a swellinge vpon the lyuer. But when the apostemacion is vnder the lyuer / then getteth a man great payne in the ryght syde: and thys is fathe knowen thereby / that whan he eateth / he waxeth cold / or els when he ∣weth hys breth / that doth greue hym betwene the shulders and liuer. If the apostemacion commeth of heate / then hath the patiente a sore a∣gue and great thyrste / and his tounge is at the fyrst reade / and afterwarde black: and it that goeth from hym is fyrst Colera / and becommeth grene af∣ter that. ¶A good drinke for the Lyuer / howsoeuer she is diseased. Cure of the liuer vvith drī¦kes and other∣vvyse.TAke foure rootes of Cicory / but if they are greate / take but twayn / washe them clene / cut of the herbe / seth them in a quarte of water / vntyll the thyrde part be sodden in / or a litle lesse. Let the same wa¦ter coole / and drinke it fastinge / howsoeuer ye will: yet not to mu∣che at ones: thesame doth purge the lyuer / and healeth also. But if the disease is vnder the lyuer / then geue him also pilles of Iera pi¦cra / and take hede / lest the apostemacion waxe harde. If it waxeth to hard / it can be remedyed wyth no medicine / for the dropsey foloweth it. Yet are some thynges / where wyth it maye be holpen / that are / Liuer wort and the iuyce of Smalage / sodden in wyne or water / if he hath no greate heate. If the apostemacion is comme of heate / then geue hym to drincke the iuyce of Fenel / the iuyce of Smalage / oyle of Almondes wyth Oxizacara. If the a∣postemacion is come of a fall or brusynge / then geue the patient a quarter of an vnce of Rebarbara wyth milke. He that hath is lyuer fauty or vnclene / let hym take Santali wood / En¦diue water and Cheruel water of eche an vnce and an halfe / mixe them to∣gether / and parte it in thre portions / and drinke therof thre morninges fas∣tinge / at eche tyme one portion / and he shalbe whole / and it is experimen∣ted and proued. ¶Of diseases of the Lyghtes or Lunges.
OF euill and corrupt ayer / that a man hath drawen into him / come di∣seases into the Lightes / and be so feruent / that a man dyeth thereof.Diseases of the ly∣ghtes or lunges. For the lunge or lightes lyeth vpon the harte / and geueth ayer to the harte: and when the corrupt or venemous ayer commeth to the harte / it infecteth it / and causeth otherwhyles the death of a man. Somtymes also fortuneth a man to haue an aposteme in the lightes / whereof is caused another to disease / called Asthma / whē the breth is short / & that by reason the condutes of the lightes are stopped.Asthma. Somtyme also get¦teth a man a disease in his lightes or poulme / that he is costumed to eat vn∣naturall and vnkinde meates / as fruytes / soure and salt meates. Such diseased must be kept from all meates / that are not good of diges¦tion / and from soure or salt meates. Also from al maner of fruyte / excepte raysynes and plummes: for they coole and lose the belly. Let him absteyne from Pigeons or Doues / and from all maner of foule that dwelleth in wa¦ters: for they are euill of digestion. For the disease of the poulmon or lyghtes / make thys playster:A plays∣ter for di¦seases of the ligh∣tes. Take the croume of whyte bread thre vnces / Terpentine two vnces / Anise two vn∣ces / Cumine thre vnces / Hony foure vnces: all these seth in whyte wyne / & let them seth / vntill the wyne is neare hand sodden awaye: make a playster hereof / and laye it vpon his poulmon / as warme as he can suffre it / and the payne shalbe swaged. Thesame playster is good also layde vpon other gre∣fes / and it is good also for the breth. If the disease of the lyghtes were come vpon one of a stinkinge or vene¦mous ayer / then must ye geue him within thre dayes a purgation / namelye thre morninges the one after the other a penyweyght of fyne Tyriakle in a draught of warme wyne. After yt anoynte him wyth thys salue: Take Ter∣pentine / Aqua vite / of ech an vnce / Dialthea thre quarters of an vnce: mixe these together / and strake it vpon his brest. He that hath this disease / it is ne¦cessary that he be continently holpen / for he might lightely dye of the infec∣tion. Thys drinke folowyng is a speciall medicine for hym euery morninge and euenynge taken two vnces.A drinke for the in¦fect poul¦mon or lyghtes▪ Take Licoris an vnce and an halfe / Bra∣ke of the wall an vnce / the middest pyll or shell of Ground pyne called in La¦tine Chamepitis thre quarters of an vnce / Figges / Raysins / sede of Malo∣wes / of eche thre quarters of an vnce / Mayden heyre / Isope of eche a hand¦ful / Barly an vnce / water a pottel: Braye them that are to be brayed / & seth them with the water / that the water be sodden awaye two finger bredth / then let it stand so al night / and in the morninge strayne it / and then drinke therof as is sayde before. Item they yt consume sore / whose eyes waxe depe in their heades / they cough much / and haue payne in the left syde / and about the brest / them may ye helpe of this wyse:For a cō∣sumpci Geue them Diapenidion or Diagragantum / & make them thys drinke: Take thre vnces of Licorise / Anis sede / and Isope / of eche a handfull / seth these all in a quarte of water / strayne it through a cloth / and put thereto at the lest halfe an vnce / or thre quarters of an vnce of Suger. Marke also whether they haue any heate / for then geue them mylk to drin¦ke. Make them also suppositories of honye and salte. If they cough & theyr blood be euill / then let them bloode vpon the hande or in the arme.
Theyr meates maye be hogges fete / chykins / motton / newe baken breade / and stale drinkes. Item when a man can not well drawe hys breth / then help him of this wyse: Take Syropum de Sticados foure vnces / Syropum de Calamen∣ta / and Syropum de Hyssopo / of eche two vnces / mixe them together and vse it. ¶A good barlye water for all diseases of the Poulmon or Lyghtes. A special barly vva¦ter for many di∣seases.TAke halfe a pounde of fayre Barly / a galon of water / halfe an vnce of Licorise / Fenel sede / Violettes / Persely sede / of eche a quarter of an vnce / Read roses a quarter of an vnce / drye Isop / and Sauge of eche a penyweyghte / syxe leaues of Hartes tounge / a quarter of an vnce of Figges or Raysins: seeth all these in a newe potte / that the wa∣ter be sodden awaye two finger bredth / and sette the potte in colde water / and then strayne the clere from it / and drincke it. Thesame cooleth the ly∣uer and all the membres / driueth awaye all euill heate / slaketh thyrste / cau∣seth to caste out muche / purgeth the lightes / the spleine and the kidneys / the bladder / and causeth to make well water / & is specially good for all agues / that come of heate. ¶Howe to helpe a man that hath a disease or a stiche in hys syde / or an euell splene / or an aposteme wyth in vpon hys rybbes. Payne or stiche in the syde and the tokens of it.PAyne in the syde commeth of euill stinkinge moystnesse / whych cau¦seth an imposteme in the left syde vpon the ribbes. If the aposteme commeth vpon the ribbes / then dyeth a man lyghtely wythin thre dayes of the stenche of the aposteme / strikinge to the harte / wyth∣out a spedy remedy be sought. Fyrst ought he to be well letten blood in the Median in the right arme: and if the aposteme is in the ryght syde / thē ou∣ght he to be letten bloode in the left arme. And before all is it to be knowen sayeth Galen / whereby the aposteme is occasioned / afore ye ministre ought to hym / and also in whych syde the disease is. If it is in the ryght syde / then commeth it of the lyuer: If it is in the left syde / then cometh it of the splene: and therfore haue Hipocrates and Auicenna sayd / that he that hath this di∣sease / shoulde be letten blood in great quantitye / after that hys strength is. If the disease is in the left syde / than doth hys harte shake and beat / and hath great payne in hys left syde / handes and fete are colde / payne in the reynes / strong and feruent agues / and great stichynge when the ague com¦meth vpon hym: the disease is come of Flegma and black Colera. But if the disease is in the right syde / then commeth it of the lyuer and of superfluous bloode / and therefore is it requisite to minishe a greate deale of the patientes blood at the begynnynge / after that he hath strength. And he that hath thys disease / the same hath febres acutas / and great payne in the forheade / and all his membres do ake. He hath also in hys slepe many ima∣ginacions
and dreames / and thyrsteth: all swete meates are contrarye to hym / and listeth after soure meates and eger / he hath also great heate in the lyuer. His face and eyes also are reade / hys nose continuallye sharpe and seere or drye: the second daye after that the disease leaueth hym / than chaun∣geth hys face / and the nayles of hys fingers become whyte. These foresayde tokens are not good / for they signifye the death of the patiente wythin thre dayes. If the patient in the beginning of thys disease doth list to drinke wi∣ne / then ought the Physicion to beware how to counsel hym. When a man hath a stich in hys syde / then geue hym to drynke water of Morsus diaboli / (that is an herbe / whose roote is as it were bitten of) ether distilled or sodden. Lykewise also doth Saffron dronke. Or els take hony & milke of a Cowe of eche halfe a pinte / let thē be wel warmed together / wet a linnen cloth of halfe an elle longe and broade therein / and laye it so warm therevpon / and the stiche will strayght waye be alayed. Howbeit I haue alwaye put thereto wheaten meel thre quarters of an vnce / and two penny weyght of beaten saffron / straked vpon the cloth / and layd warme vpon it lyke a playster. But in sommer did I laye the leaues of whyte Horehunde / chapped small / and put in a bagge / sodden in milke / pres¦sed out / and layed warme vpon the syde / thesame swaged it. I haue somty∣me also vsed it seere. Or els take a fyne lynnen cloth / and folde it so / that it be a spanne long / wet it in the pacients vrine / whyle she is yet warme / presse it oute a litle for droppinge / and laye it where the stiche is. And when it is drye / then wett it agayne therein: thesame draweth the humours oute / and alayeth the stiche furth wyth. Though thys science doth not so wholye ayde / yet doth it not hurte / though it were a woman in chyldes bedde. Or els take a colde flinte stone or pauing stone and holde it vpon the sore place / and the blood draw∣eth back / and the paciente is healed. The barkes of an Ashe tree / sodden in wyne / and droncken of hym that hath a harde splene / thesame doth weaken it wythout doute: Thys may ye proue of thys wyse: Geue a swyne thesame barckes to eate nyne dayes one after the other / and when it is slayne / loke after the splene / and ye shall not fynde it halfe. He that hath payne in hys syde / let him take a kake of beaten Linesede / seth it in water / and wet a linnen cloth therein / and laye it warm vpon the syde / and it shall fayde strayghtwaye. When a man hath a payne in hys sy∣de / and speciallye in the left syde / then take a quarte of whyte wyne / the sixte parte of a quarte of honye / a hande full of Percely / or els two vnces of the sede thereof: seeth thesame in a newe pott / the sixte parte awaye / geue hym the same to drincke when it waxeth colde / both in the morninge and eueninge / and he shall waxe whole doutlesse. Or els if a man hath greate stiches and payne in hys syde / I toke halfe a pounde of milcke / two vnces of honye / an vnce of wheaten meel / a penyworth of Saffron / and layde it warme thereon. ¶Of all diseases of the bellye / and hys partes annexed.
ANis sede / howsoeuer it is vsed / driueth out windes / that be strayenge in the guttes / and combre the stomake / and chafe the lyuer: it maketh also good digestion / and is good agaynst belkinge or breakinge vp of soure windes / of a colde and vndigested stomacke. If any person / ether man or woman had a grepinge in hys guttes / spe∣cially the frettinge in the great guttes / and he or she were poore: let him ta∣ke a litle waxe candle / and make therof a crosse vpright / vpon a pece of pa∣pir / the bignes of a groate / festened or clyued vpon the belly / and lightened / and a litle glasse set thereon: thesame draweth the payne to it. Or els take a bondel of rawe hempe threde / and seth it in water where are manye ashes / and laye it so warme vpon the belly. If ye haue no hempe threde / then do as I did when I was called by a woman / that was at the poynt of trauaylinge / and had so greate payne in her bellye / that the chylde lept vp and doune / so that all they that were ab∣oute her / were astonnyed / nether durst anye man minister oughte to her: I bande both her legges aboue the kne hard and faste wyth a bande / and let it so alwaye an Aue Maria / and then losed it agayne a litle space / and band it agayne so oft / tyll the payne was holy taken awaye. Auicenna sayth / that a man maye well drinke hote water in Colica pas∣side / that is grepinge in the great guttes / and also when the splene ryseth and swelleth. If any man were mistempered and hard in hys body / nother could ma¦ke water / then take two hand full of Wormwood / cut it small / and put it in a bagge a quarter of an elle longe and brode / seth the same in halfe water / halfe wyne / strayne it out a litle / that it droppe not / laye it vpon his body as warme as he can suffre it halfe an houre longe / and let hym eat twelue car¦nels of Peaches. And when the bagge waxeth colde / then let him warme it agayne in the former water and wyne / and thys shal he do in the morning / at none / and in the eueninge: of thys wyse shall the mistemperaunce of the bodye and hardnesse be alayed / and he shall well make water. Or els take branne and water Cresses / of eche alyke / aboute two quar∣tes / chappe the water cresses very small / make a bagge large a quarter of an elle / and as longe / that it maye well reche about your loynes / then putte the water cresses and branne therein / steare them wel / lest they cluster / seth it well in a kettel wyth water / anoynte the loynes wyth Meye butter / or other butter so bigge as an egge / and it that is left of the butter / laye vpon the nauel / and couer it wyth a litle dishe: then presse the backe a litle out / lest it droppe / and winde it about the patient as warme as he can suffre it: do thys in the morninge / at none / and to bedwarde / let it lye an houre or more at euery tyme / after that he is stronge and can suffre it. Lette hym lye vpon hys backe for the most parte / for that mollifieth the body well / taketh away the mistempering and the payne / and causeth to make well water: but be∣fore any thynge loke he haue sieges. Dryenes of the di∣gestion.Somtyme doth it fortune also nature to become so drye and seere / that the meate can not voyde for greate drought / wherof he hath so great payn / that he euen swelleth. If the disease is of a swellinge / that shall ye knowe thereby / that he is swollen and hath payne / so that he can nether nighte nor
daye haue anye rest / but crieth continually. Thesame maye ye helpe of thys wyse: Take Cotton / olde or stale butter / vinegre / salt / of eche thre vnces: put thesame in a panne / & stere them together / seth them without burninge / vn∣till they waxe a litle thicke: then take a fylt or thyck wollen cloth / vpon the same sowe a pece of sustein or other linnen cloth / and theron strake this for∣sayd confection. And when the pacient doth demande it / or hath nede of it / then warme it by the fyre / and anoynte hym well wyth oyle of Camomille and oyle of ilye well warmed / wher he hath the greatest payne / and then laye the playster thereon as warme as he can suffre it. This shall ye do in ye morninge / at none and eueninge / and it shall ease him both of the swellynge and payne. Marke also / that if there be to litle salue vpon the playster / then strake more thereon / or els if it fall of wyth the warmth: for she oughte to be a finger thicke at the least. It were good also he dyd bath in water / where∣in a basket ful of Malowes are sodden / as warm as he can suffre it / and ye muste take hede that he haue good sieges / and geue him to eate meates of light digestion / as are shepe or calues heades / chekins / and such lyke. But if he can haue no sieges then geue him a quarter of an vnce of Electuariū ro∣sarum / wyth the weyght of fyue barly cornes of Diagridion: mixe thē well together with warme wyne / & geue him it before daye / if he will / lette hym drinke agayne therevpon: and if he can / let him walke vpon his drinke / for that is good: if not / let him beware of slepe. And if he cā haue no sieges ther∣of / then be sure / that he is bounde and swollen wythin / and therefore muste he be holpen strayghtwaye with suppositories of Alume: but if they wil not helpe / then set him a clister therwith: Take milke and halfe an vnce of Frā∣kincense / put thesame into a new pot / wherein are put hote koles: put thesa∣me vnder a stole wyth a hole / and set the pacient thereon / that the vapoure maye go vp into hym as hote as he can suffre it. But before ye set the potte wyth the coles vnder the stoole / laye an houre or twayne thys playster vpō the pacientes bodye: Take Malowes wyth the rootes / washe them clene / chap them small / seth them in water vntill they waxe weake: then presse thē well / and frye them in a pan / in a pint of butter or fat / till it waxe a litle dry / and then let it coole: And when it is so dressed / than put it into a fyne linnen bagge / lyke a cussin: And the sack must be a quarter of an elle broad / and so∣wed together and laced / lyke a pillowe. And when ye haue nede of this kus¦sin / then put it into a kettel wyth water / and seth it / tyll it waxeth hote: thē presse it oute that it do not droppe / and laye it about the pacientes body / as warme as he can suffre it: and set hym there wyth vpon a stoole / and sette the potte there vnder / as is sayde before: this weakeneth the swelling with in and wythout / and causeth an easy siege wythoute hurt. This were good for them that haue harde sieges / and haue the matter burnte within them / whereby they voyde it wyth payne. To suche oughte to be ministred in a draught a syrope of Violettes / and in the morninge halfe an vnce of succus Rosarum: If thesame doth not worke within a houre / then laye the forsayd playster thereon / and set hym vpon the stoole wyth the pott vnder it / as is specifyed before / and then shall he haue sieges wythout any smarte. ¶To clense the guttes.
TAke halfe an vnce of meel of Fenugrecum / seth that with a pint of wa∣ter / and poure of the clere / mixe to thesame an vnce of hony / and drinke thereof in the morning and eueninge. ¶For them whose guttes are gnawen or wounded. Fretting of guttesTHesame shalbe marked thereby / in his sieges issueth bloude also / and that happeneth by two causes / the one is outwarde / the oher inward. The inwarde cause is by reason of an vnclene and pearsynge moystnesse / caused by a salte Flegma / and thesame woūdeth or fretteth the guttes. But the outwarde cause is / some greate laboure / which a man doth / and stray∣neth hym sore / so that the guttes are thereof so fretted / that the bloude folo∣weth thereafter. If ye will knowe whereof it is / then take hede to the matter / that issu∣eth from him wyth the bloude: If it be reede / then is it of Colera: but if it is as the vnclennesse of the nose / then is it of Flegma. After that must ye take hede whether the bloude commeth of the vpper guttes / or of the nether∣most guttes / or els the middelmost guttes. If it commeth from the vpper∣most guttes / then hath he payne aboue the nauel: if it issueth from the ne∣thermost guttes / then hath he payne beneth the nauel. When now the bloud commeth from the vpyermoste guttes / then geue the pacient his medicine into his mouth. Is it of the reed Colera / then geue him gumme Arabick wyth the iuyce of Porcelen / wyth a syrop of Mirtill / and geue him syrop of Roses / and geue him bread styped in Almondes bea∣ten / and geue him to drinke water sodden wyth small rasins. But when the bloud commeth from the nethermost or middelmost gut¦tes / and that of the reed Colera / then geue him a clister wyth these thinges: Take Roses / yolkes of Egges / Porcelene / and pilled Barly sodden in wa∣ter / and make a clister hereof. Restraīte in the smal gut∣tes, and the sig∣nes of it.Somtyme happeneth a restraynt in the small guttes / by reason the sli∣mye matter strayeth / because she can not voyde beneth / and then riseth it vp toward the throte wyth perbreakinge. This disease happeneth somtyme of an hote aposteme in the stomake. It commeth also of a colde humor / that is gathered in the stomake. The restraynte caused by an aposteme / is knowen thereby / that the belly is swollen / and he draweth winde or breth vneasely: he getteth also an ague and great thyrst. But if the restraynt were of a cold humor / thesame is not swollen in the bellye / and he is withoute an ague or thyrste: his handes and fete are colde / he is heuy and waketh much / nother can rest in one place / somtyme will he haue thys / somtyme that. He that is thus diseased / dyeth lightely the third daye / and he is paynfull to heale. If ye will take in hand to heale such a disease / then take hede first / wher of such restraynte is caused. If it is caused by an aposteme / then geue hym Cassia fistula with Iera picra / tempered wt oyle of Violettes. If the siknesse is strong / thē let him bloud in the liuer veyne / and make hym a clister wyth Malowes / Barly / Lentils / and oyle of Violettes. But if the restrainte is come by cold humors / thē clense the pacient Benedicta / & wyth Iera picra / thesame do expel / and make him a clister of Dill Fenegreke / Oyle of Camo¦mille
/ and oyle of Holder. Or els take the floure of Fenegreke halfe an vnce / and hony a quarter of an vnce: mixe thesame together with warme water / so much as nede is / and geue him thesame to drinke fasting & to bedwarde: thesame purgeth the guttes of the superfluous slyme / wherof is caused som¦tyme greate payne and grepinges. But for the greping as in the great guttes / take ye bladder of a Swine / and put it full of warme wyne / laye it vpon the nauel as hote as ye can suf∣fre it / do it oft / and it shall take awaye the payne / thesame hath oft ben expe∣rimented and proued. Or els take a black Henne / and laye her warm vpon the nauel / cut it in two peces or sliced quicke. Agaynste anye maner of other grepinge / take the harte of a Wolffe and the guttes / drye them / & make pou¦der of them: put thesame into a boxe. In that pouder growe litle wormes / let thesame therin / & when ye will vse thē / take thē one after the other / bray or breake thē wyth wyne / and geue it him to drinke. Or els take half an vnce of oyle of Benedicta / oyle of Camomil / oyle of Melissa or Baume / of eche a quarter of an vnce / mixe them together / & bid the pacient lye vpon hys backe / and put foure or sixe droppes of the oyles in to the pacientes nose / as warme as he can suffre it wyth a fether or other thynge: laye a whot cloth vpon it / and let it lye stil. Do thys oft / and let him beware of cold thynges in his meates or drinkes. Or els take whyte cattes dounge / brayed and made fyne to pouder / ste∣re that wyth whyt wyne / and geue it him to drinke thre tymes. Or els take reed nettels that haue reed floures / wyth the rootes a good handfull / seth them well wyth a pint of good wyne / coole it / and geue him it to drinke. ¶Howe to dryue awaye the wormes in the bellye. THe wormes called Lumbriciin Latin / growyng in the bodye / shall ye know of thys wyse:Lūbrici, that is, vvormes in the bel¦lye. the pacient hath payne about the nauel & ye guttes / & somtyme do they voyd beneth or aboue. When they are found / howsoeuer they are engendred / ye shal help the pacient of this wyse: Take a quarter of an vnce of Herteshorne / & as much salt / & seth it with foure spounfuls of wa¦ter / and geue him thesame to drinke: do this oft / and they shall all dye. This is also a noble medicine and oft proued: Take yolkes of egges / & a litle chalke / & four spounfull of strong vinegre: geue thesame the paciente to drinke in the morninge fasting / and do this thre morninges one after the o∣ther / and they shall drye without dout. After that geue hym a quarter of an vnce of Esula / and thesame dryueth awaye from hym all the wormes and fylthynesse. This is also a sure and proued medicin: He that hath wormes in his bel∣ly / thesame shal drinke water sodden wyth hony / & that shal he do twyse or thre tymes fastinge / that the wormes maye be drouned therewyth. After yt shall he drincke the iuyce of Wormwood / Fumiterre / Peaches / & leaues of Beanes: hereof must they all dye: Or els take ij. vnces of the iuyce of Worm¦wood / an vnce of Oxes gall mixte together / & straked vpon the belly. And if ye put half an vnce of Aleopaticum & Euphorbium / then helpeth it so muche
the better: howbeit the gall of an Hare were better then of an Oxe. Agaynst the wormes in the belly take onyons and pyll them / cut or slyse them small / powre springinge water ouer them / let it stande so all nighte / & in the morninge drinke that water / and it driueth away al wormes. Poure thesame water vpon the earth where wormes are / & within halfe an houre shall they crepe out of the earth. Lykewyse if one eate garlike fastinge / it killeth & driueth out wormes out of the bodye Or els drinke distilled water of knotgrasse or shauegrasse / thesame killeth wormes also: howbeit it worketh more in yonge then olde folke. ¶If a man had no sieges and were stopped. To make sieges.ARe they of middel age / than geue thē thre quarters of an vnce of Dia¦carthami. But if it is a man of a great & stronge bodye / then geue him halfe an vnce of it halfe an houre before daye / and walke well vpon it / if he can / nother eat nor drinke before he haue had sieges. But if he can not walke for sycknes / then let him be caried / or sit vpright in his bed / and let his back / body and legges be softely rubbed: and if he is so strong / let him turne him selfe from the one syde to the other. Let him fast iij. or iiij. houres at the least after that he hath taken it. But if it were to hard / then let him drink a good draught of warme wa¦ter / the night before: that helpeth very well / that it may worke so muche the better in the morninge. And if the pacient were of a very hote and drye cō∣plexion / and that his sieges were harde / then geue him two nightes & two morninges before / euerye mornyng a good draught of syrop of Violettes to drinke / specially the night before he will take the comfecte. But if ye haue no syrop of Violettes / then drinke a good draught of whaye of milke bloud warme / and anoynt the nauell wyth creme / thesame soffteneth wel. But I haue somtyme taken for poore people only the Gall of an oxe / and swynes fat or grece of lyke quantitie / molten together / and straked their nauel well therewyth / and layed thereon of it as bigge as a walnut / & couered a dishe vpon it. But if he was colde / then toke I butter in steade of swynes grece / and did as is specified before / thesame mollifyeth very well. Geue him also in the morning halfe an vnce of Electuarium de succo Rosarum / mixt with a broth of fresh Byfe / that is not to fatt: geue him a good draught of ye same to drinke / as hote as he can brouke it: thesame driueth ye matter out / and ma¦keth her apte to voyde. But if he can haue no whaye / then geue him a good broth of whyte vnsalted Peasen in the euening / in steade of the whaye: and in steade of the flesh broth / take an vnsalted broth of whyt Peasen / without anye fatnesse. If ye will haue it to mollifye yet more / put thereto the thyrde parte so much of rootes of Malowes / as is of the Pease broth: & this shal ye vse in stead of the syrop of Violettes. When he hath taken the purgacion in the morning / if he is stronge / then let him walke well therevpon:Agaynst perbrea∣kinge of cōfecti∣ons takē. if not / let hym slepe therevpon / but it were better not. Some men ther are / whych whan they take ye Electuaries or cōfectiōs / do perbreake / by reason of their swetenesse: wherefore ye maye geue them
halfe an vnce of Diaprunis laxatiui / thesame is soure / and hath thesame o∣peration / and dryueth out very easely. But if such a siege dyd tarye vntill the euening before it did worke then seth hym a water with a litle Licoris / and a litle Hony / and when he goeth to bedde / let hym drinke a good draught of thys water / blood warme: the∣same mollifyeth verye well / that it maye voyde / and he maye haue a siege wythout any harme and vncase / and after that geue hym nyne Pyllulas communes. But if it were a fishe day when he would take it / then geue him a pease broth in stede of a fleshbroth / as is specified before. He also that hath a wambling in hys stomake / or doth lightely perbrea∣ke / when he hath taken ought:Vvāblīg of the sto¦make of purgaci∣ons takē▪ let thesame holde a pece of tosted breade be∣fore hys mouth / as warme as he can suffre it. For assone as the stomake per¦ceyueth the sauoure of the bread / then doth the wamblinge alaye. If a man had taken oughte / to cause hym to haue sieges / and it woulde not wyde neuerthelesse / and hym thought he should do hys easemente / and yet coulde not: then take Brenne / Malowes / both the herbe and rootes of lyke quantitie / chappe the herbes small / and seth these wel in water  and set the pacient in that water vntill the nauel / as warme as he can suffre it / and it shall weaken in a man / that he shall haue sieges. But if he will not bath / then put the Branne and herbes together / and put them in two small bag∣ges lyke in kussins or pylowbeers / and laye the one of them before vpon his belly and nauel / and the other behynde vpon hys loynes / as warme as he can suffer them. Thesame mollifyeth hym well / that he maye haue sieges wythout hurt. If a man had taken a medicine laxatiue / and it were to stronge for him / so that he must do his easement to often / wherof he might get a grepinge or other inconuenience:Restraīte of ouer∣much sie¦ges or greping. then make a litle shete warme / and laye it vpon hys bellye and loynes / as warme as he can suffre it: and let hym lye vpon hys backe / and couer him warme / and lye still a good whyle / and the grepynge shall go awaye wythout hurte. ¶Whan the gutte (where through the ordure passeth) go∣eth out / howe to set it in agayne. VVhen the last or nethermost gut / through the whyche the ordure voydeth from man / goeth out of the bodye also / whyche commeth of a siege / and if that doth happē oft / it must be forsene / or els doth it bringe to a man greate inconuenience. Helpe hym of thys wise:Of goīg oute of the gutt vvyth sie¦ges. Take the herbe called in Latin Ononis / or Resta bonis / both herbe & rote / chappe it small / seth it well in water / tyll it waxe soft / put it into a litle bag / sitte vpon it whyle it is warme: do thys thre tymes in the daye / and when it waxeth colde / warme it agayne in the former water: of thys wyse remay¦neth it soft and thynne. Or els bake him a litle cake wyth thys forsayd her∣be / or wyth hys read floure lyke to a pease floure: or if ye will / geue hym the same wyth a slyce of breade / and thys hath ben experimented and founde true. Thys must be vsed eyght dayes longe. But if ye can not haue thys
herbe / take twelue hand ful of meel or pouder of Oken barkes / put thē into a bagge / seth them as before / and sit theron / and it goeth in agayne. ¶An other true and proued science / when the basse or last gut issueth or is swollen. TAke wormes / chap them small / and braye them well / and put so muche oyle of roses thereto / that it become as a thick broth: stere it well & stra¦ke it vpon a linnen cloth / the thycknesse of a finger / let the cloth be softe / and a hande broade. Laye thys vpon the sycke place as warme as the paciente can suffre it: and when it is colde / then laye strayght waye another there∣on / thesame helpeth well and continentlye. It is good also to wette a softe cloth in milke / and laye it vpon the sycke place / where the gut is gone oute: and when thesame is colde / take it awaye / and laye another warme in the steade of it. If the place is swollen or waxed hard / the gut shall returne in∣to the bodye by litle and litle wythout anye harme. Yet is it better to seth Malowes in goates mylke tyll they be weake / and laye them warm vpon it: thesame mollifye it wythoute anye hurte / that the gutte entreth agayne easelye▪ Towe dypped in the iuyce of Sloes / is very good for hym / whose basse gut is issued: for layd vpon it / driueth it in agayne wythout any hurt. Or els take the pouder of burnt egges shales / warm and strow it vpon it / and lay a warme cloth vpon it / and that helpeth. ¶When a man hath to manye sieges / howe that maye be letted. SIeges that are ouermuch / are diuerse. The one is / that the stomak doth digest the meat and drinke of a man the better / because he hath a faut in the power retentiue. An other is by reason of superfluous moysture in ye sto∣make or guttes: or els the power retentiue hath force in the stomack / & so in the guttes / by reason of fylthy moysture / that is hote and prickinge. If the disease is in the power retentiue / which shoulde retayn the meat in the stomake / then must it be consydered / what moysture or humors be ga¦thered in ye stomake / & whence they come. If the disease cometh of euil com∣plexion / then must the pacient be demanded / whether he feleth any heate in hys stomack / & whether he hath great thyrst / & whether he haue a bulkinge or breakinge of winde: for thereby maye it well be gessed / whether the siege be of ouermuch heat or not. If he haue no thyrste / and eateth well / but diges¦teth slenderly: then is his siege caused of cold / and therfore doth the stomak digest euill. He that will staye that siege assuredlye / must eat and drinke lit∣le / and vse two or thre dayes nomore but one kinde of meate / and be still: by that shall the stomacke be satled / and also the fundamente / and also the run∣ning staunched wythout hurte or daunger. These meates do bind a man in his belly: hard egges / and Payst made wyth egges / & baken in the herth / rosted Peeres / bakē meates / Rice made wyth almōde milke / potages of barly / Barly water / Beanes / Peeres dried
in an ouen / Amilum / Medlers / Suger of roses. Or els take the stones or carnels in the grapes / beate them well / put them in a cloth / laye them in rey¦ne water or springinge water a daye and a nyghte / then strayne the water well out / and drinke a good draught therof fasting in the morning and at e∣uen to bedwarde: thesame stoppeth the hote fluxe verye well. Or els eate Sloes / that stoppeth sieges whether they be of heate or colde. Or els eate Moulberies dryed / thesame stoppe sieges. Lykewyse also do Bremble be∣ries not fully rype / and dryed and eaten / stoppe all maner of sieges / caused of greate heat. ¶A playster for sieges. TAke a quarte of Akornes dryed and made to pouder / mixte wyth the whyte of an egge and vinegre in maner of a playster vpon a cloth / and layed about the loynes. But it were better to lace ye play¦ster vpon the belly vnder the nauel / and so about ye body / as warm as he can suffre it: and when it is drye / then refreshe it agayn wyth ye whyte of an egge and vinegre / as is sayd before / and pouder it fyne agayne. Thys maye be done thre tymes. ¶A good science for the bloudye flixe and other sie∣ges or flixes / of what cause soeuer they be / and it stoppeth very well. TAke a Turtel / put it in a potte / and couer it / set it in an ouen / tyll it be burnt all to pouder: and if any man hath a flixe / let hym take an egge / warme it well by the fyre / open it / and put awaye the whyte: then take of the pouder / as muche as a chest nutte / mixe it wyth the yolke / and eat it fas∣tynge / do thys thre mornynges / and it shalbe staunched / and it is speciallye good for all maner of bloudy flixes. Or els seth the Turtel wyth water / salt her not to sore / but let her be well sodden wyth a broth / and geue it the pa∣cient / and it stoppeth him. Disenteria is a bloody flixe / cōminge somtime from the guttes / somtime from the liuer / somtime from the stomacke. If it is from the iuer / then hath he payne in hys right syde / then can he scarsely be holpen. But if it is from the stomake / then hath he payne in the holowe of the harte / & that is dead∣ly: for the small guttes are nearehande rased and gnawen through. But if he hath payn beneth the nauel / then commeth it from the great guttes / and he maye be yet well holpen. Ye must also marke / that the bloudye flixe must not be staunched so sodenly / till ye euill matter is voyded / & ye guttes be clen∣sed. After that helpe him thus: Geue him whay of Goates milke and barly water of eche lyke much / put a litle hony in the barly water / and seth thē to¦gether / and skomme them. After that put the whey thereto / and stere them together / and then take it from the fyre / and geue the pacient alway therof to drinke bloud warme with milke / both in ye morning / none and eueninge▪ thys healeth the guttes inwardly. Lykewise also doth water of Waybrede dronke in the morning / at none and eueninge.
Agaynst the bloody flixe / take a quarter of an vnce of Sanguis draco∣nis / made to pouder / drinke it in a potage or broth / or els eate in a weake or soft egge: thesame is experimented that it stoppeth: or els geue hym Knot∣grasse to eat vpon a soppe / or in some potage / or els howsoeuer he can eat it / or els in an egge as is sayde before / and that stoppeth the blood / both aboue and beneth. ¶A true medicine for the bloody flixe. TAke the tappettes or slouringe of Walnuttes and Filberts when they florishe / new gathered after that they be fallen from ye trees / and put them into a basin / and drye them in the Sonne or in an ouen / that they rot not: beat them to pouder / and he that hath the bloudy flixe / geue hym a quarter of an vnce thereof in an egge rosted wyth oyle / tyll it be harde: and eate thre morninges so muche thereof at euery ty∣me / and fastinge. And if it will not be staunched / then geue hym half an vn∣ce of thys pouder in an egge. Yet another for the bloudye flixe / whyche comforteth the stomacke / and seasoneth the mouth if it is vnseasoned: for surely it cooleth hym and slaketh thyrste / and dryueth awaye the heate of the lyuer. Take suger of Roses as muche as a chest nut / and a quarter of an vnce of Sanguis draconis made to pouder / and geue hym a good draught of reyne water to drynke vpon it / or els conduyte water / or yet barly water. And if ye can haue nether of the∣se / then seth well crosted broune breade in water: the courser the bread is / ye better is it: Let the water be a good pint / and the crostes as much as a fist / and let hym eate thereof oft in the daye / and speciallye to bedwarde / at ny∣ght / and in the morninge. It were good also that he had somtyme pylled Al¦mondes / that haue lyen longe in colde water / or els to geue hym a slyce of bread styped in colde water / thesame cooleth and stopped very well. Or els take two flynt stones / and a pece of stile / and make them glowynge whote / and laye them than in milke of a Cowe / and thereof drinke fastinge a good draught bloud warme. Do thys thre morninges / and it shall auoyde. Ye maye also heate flyntstones and stile / and laye them in milke / & drinke ther∣of in the morninge and at eueninge. Or els take the rotes of Burres as mu¦che as a penye loaffe / chappe them small / and seth them in a newe pot wyth good wyne / let the paciente sit ouer them / that the vapor maye go vp into hym: do that oft / and the flixe shall staunche / whereof soeuer it be. It stop∣peth also the floures of women / whē they haue thē to sore. Also take Peers dryed / and seth them in water / and drinke thereof / and it shal staunche / and after a laxatiue / doth it stoppe the sieges continently. Binding meates.These meates oughte they to eate / that haue sieges: roosted Pygeons / and all meates that drye / as are Lentilles / Rice / Amilum / pared or shauen Herteshorne / or els Beenes sodden wyth vinegre vntill they pearche / and geue hym these to eate thre dayes continuallye / nether geue him anye other meate. ¶How the flixes maye be knowen.
VVhen the bloudy flixe commeth from the vppormost bowels / thē issueth from man pure bloud / with digestion of the fylth of mans body / and thereof getteth a man greate payne in the vpperpart of his body or nauel. Him may ye helpe of this wise:Flixe of the vp∣permost bovvels. Take Hēpsede / braye or beate thesame well / & put a litle water vpon it / strayne it through a cloth. Then seth two egges / yt they remayne very softe / & put of the Hēpsede milke therto / as much as al the egges be / beat thē wel together / & take ye fas¦ting: thesame stoppeth the flixe / & auoydeth the payn. Or els seth ye rootes of Burres or the sede in water / or them both / and drinke it fasting: but it were very good to seth the sede in reyne water. If it commeth of the middelmost bowels or guttes / than is the siege or flixe colored black wyth bloud / or els grene wyth thesame.Flixe frō the mid∣delmost bovvels. To cure thesame is make a vaporaciō beneth wt Rāmes greace or fat / waxe / pitche & Cumin ech of lyke quantitie / put thē in a new pot / & couer it close / set it vpon a fire / tyll it waxe thorow hote / and do smoke sore: than set it vnder a stole wyth a hole / and set the pacient thereon / as hote as he can suffre it. But if the bloud commeth of the nethermost bowels / then is the siege yt issueth therewyth yalow / black / pale / or els of a grene deadly coloure.Flixe of the ne∣ther∣most gut¦tes or bo¦vvels. The same may be holpen of this wise: Geue him rosted Rāmes flesh to eat / & olde hennes sodden / and specially the fete / and barly water to drinke. Item Al∣monde milke wyth water / thesame comforteth the harte. But if the siege be by reason a man hath eaten ought that is vnholsom / then ought he not be staunched so sone. There is also a flixe / called the whyte siege / in Latin Lienteria / thesame is / when the meate is voyded vndigested.Liente∣ria, and the cau∣ses of it. Thesame siege commeth somty∣me of slymy matter lyenge in the stomake / and that is knowen by the heui∣nesse of the stomake. ¶Of payne in the Loynes. THesame commeth somtyme of heate / somtyme of colde. Whē it cōmeth of heate / then vanisheth all te pacientes moisture / & his vrine becōmeth reed / or els yalow as an Orenge appel.Payne in the Loy∣nes. He yt hath that disease / geue him the milke of a Soo wt Dragagātum / and Malowes / make a potage therwith and he must beware of all suche thynges as chafe or warme hym / & of salte meates / and geue hym all coolinge meates / or els geue hym potages made of barly and Spinage / that cooleth well / or els geue hym a Barly potage wyth butter / for that cooleth & mollifieth hym well: If he hath the power and is able / geue him Triasandali. Payne in the loynes and back commeth somtyme by ouermuch compa∣nyenge wyth women. Thesame helpe of thys wyse:Payne in the back and loy∣nes. Let him beware of wo¦men / and if he hath heate or thyrste / then geue hym suger Candye / and lette him beware of all hote thinges. But if he hath no heate / then geue him such thinges as do warme him moderatly / and let hym go to some bath / and eat meates of good digestion. Item if he haue any faulte in hys liuer / let him take hede thereto / for thē must he not bathe / before his heate of the Liuer be swaged.
But if the payne in the loynes commeth of cold / then hath the paciente no lust vpon womē / and hys back doth ake very sore / and also hys thyghes: hys vrine is whytysh as water. Let him beware of oyle / or any fat meates / whether it be fleshe or fishe / and of all suche thinges as coole the stomake. Make also thys playster / and laye it vpon hys back and loynes / as warme as he can suffre it: Take Fenel and Smalage alyke muche / chapped small and beaten in a morter / take of eche as much as mans heade / and put ther∣to Dyll sede / oyle of Mastix / Befe suet / of eche two vnces and an halfe: put these into a panne / and whan it waxeth hote / then cast the herbes in also / & frye them well together / and laye it betwene two fyne clothes / and laye it about hys loynes / as warme as he can suffre it: and whē it is colde / warme it agayne in the panne / and laye it vp agayne. Let him do thys thre dayes / and it shall auoyde wythout any harme or payne / and doth sone helpe. Cure ge∣nerall.If thys disease ouertaketh yong folke / that be betwene twenty and fyf∣ty yeares / they may well be holpen. They must be let blood before all medi∣cines. But if thys diseas taketh aged folke / that be aboue thre score yeares / thesame can scarsely be holpen / or not: their vrine is somtyme yalow & dim∣me coloured / and when it hath stande a whyle / then hath it a cloude as it were a cobbe weble or whyte cloude: thesame are pale vnder their syghte and leane. ¶A true medicine for payne in the loynes caused of colde. TAke a quarte of floures of Camomille / seeth them in halfe wyne / halfe water / and poure out the licour or water / and braye ye floures in a mor∣ter / tyll they be all to brused. Then put them again into the water / and seth them tyll the water be clene sodden away. After that put them into a clene linnen cloth / a quarter of an elle longe / and halfe a quarter of an elle broad / and laye it as warme vpon the pacientes loynes / as he can suffre it. And when the loynes be well chafed therewyth / then take it awaye / and drye them wyth a cloth / and anoynt them wyth thys oyntment: Take a quarter of an vnce of Oleum benedictum / oyle of Camomill / oyle of Spicanardi / of eche a quarter of an vnce / oyle of Baye halfe an vnce / Dialthea / Aqua vi∣te / of eche a quarter of an vnce. Put all these into a vessell / and set it by the fyre / that it waxe warme: then anoynte the loynes therewith: after that lay the floures thereon warme as before / when they be warmed agayne in the forsayd wyne and water: Do thys in the morning and eueninge. Cure of a vvomā vvyth chylde.But if a woman were payned in hyr loynes of a cold / when she is with chylde / it were good she were gyrded in hyr flankes / that the vapor did not stryke vp into her to the harte / and let her then sit vpon the pott / wherin the bath is / that the vapour maye sticke vp into her backe / as whote as she can suffre it / and let her set hyr fete in the tobbe / wher in the same water is / and so couer her selfe wyth a mantel or longe goune / that were good for her. Take Garleke / Coriander of eche two vnces / seth them wyth a quarte of wyne / tyll the thyrde parte be sodden in: drincke that in the morning and euenynge.
If a man hath payne in his loynes of heate / then seth Fenel roe with water / and drinke that in the morninge and eueninge. Or els take Cheruel chapped small / as muche as a gouse egge / seth that in a pounde of clarifyed wyne: Drinke that to bedwarde / and eate the herbe also fastinge. ¶Agaynste payne in the loynes. TAke Veruayne / Sauie / Lauender / Wild minte / of eche two handfull / seth them well in a great pot / with thre quartes of whyte wine / wel co¦uered and stopped: put that into a tob / and sit vpon it / & let the vapor go vp into thy back / vntill ye be well warmed. Then cause the sweate be wyped from your back / till ye be drye. After that a ioynt your back with Befe suet molten / when ye will go to bed / do thys thre nightes together. This taketh awaye payne in the loynes / and specially caused of colde. Or els take honye and milke of lyke quantitie / put thesame into a newe pot / set it by the fyre vpon a treuet / seth it well / and laye it as warme vpon thy loynes / as ye can suffre it: thesame draweth out the payne. And when it waxeth colde / then warme it agayne. ¶Another science for payne in the loynes / that helpeth verye well without harme. TAke Mullen / called Tapsus barbatus / distilled / strake thesame well in to his loynes by a fyre / in the morninge / at none and to bedwarde / and do that nyne dayes continuallye. Somtyme growe apostemes in ye loynes of humors that are waltering and strayeng in the body / wherwyth doth come somtime a sore ague / & the pacient hath hys membres so heuy / that he thinketh they do hange:Aposte∣mes ī the loynes and the signes thereof. and the apostem in the loynes doth lightely become soft and so ripe / that i runneth. If the aposteme is in the right syde / then let the pacient lye vpon ye lefte syde. But if it is in the left syde / then let him lye vpon the ryght syde. After that marke whether it be of a hote humor / for then hath the pacient greate thyrste / hys vrine is reed / and happely a great moysture wythall. But if it is of a colde humor / then is the ague easyer / and hys vrine coloured lyke water. If it is of a hote humor / then is hys vrine reed / and he hath a duselynge. Geue him this medicine: Take the iuyce of Nightshade or Morel / the iuyce of Fenel seth and strayne them / and put vnder them Cassia fistula and oyle of Almondes / and geue him this. But if he hath a restraynt / that he can haue no sieges / then make him a clister / and thereto take oyle of Violettes / Barly / Malowes / oyle of Roses / of eche like quātitie / & geue him meates yt be moyst & good of digestion / & coo¦ling.A restraīt or bin∣dynge vvyth a∣postema∣cion. He must beware of all meates yt warm / & of women / & be very stil and quiet withoute mouinge. Take also Coleworts and Fenigreke of eche like much / make thē to smal pouder / & mixe them together / & laye it vpon his loy¦nes where the payne is. But if ye aposteme doth breake / then bid him drinke of an Asse. Take also Barlye meel thre vnces / Figges two vnces / sixe vn∣ces
of Malowes / mixe them well together / and wett a sponge therein / and binde it vpon the aposteme / and make hym this clister: Take halfe a pound of Kowe milke / foure vnces oyle of Roses / beat them well together / and set him a clister wyth it. The seconde daye after make him a bath / wherein are sodden a pecke of barly brayed / thre bushels of the leaues of Malowes: let thesame be well sodden / and bath therein / that mollifieth the aposteme wel / that it maye breake oute and runne. But if the aposteme or matter were to thycke / that it coulde not well runne out / than take ye iuyce of Fenel / Sma∣lage and Wormwood / of eche lyke muche: these oughte to be sodden & stray¦ned / and geue hym halfe an vnce of them wyth an vnce of mylke of Asses / beate them well together / and let hym drinke it fastinge / thesame mollify∣eth the aposteme / that it maye runne and voyde well: after that heale hym wyth playsters and salues / and clense hym well. But if hys aposteme is come of colde / then geue hym meate of good di∣gestion / and warme moderately / bydde hym rest alwaye / and kepe hym as is sayde before. ¶Howe a man shall be holpen that pisseth bloude. Pissinge of bloudSOmtyme doth passe a hote humor through the loynes / and lyeth there so longe / till it waxeth slimye / and raseth or scrapeth them / yt the vrine becommeth reade or bloudy. When that happeneth / thē laye thys bathynge sponge vpon the loynes: Take oyle of nuttes and warme water lyke much / of eche halfe a pounde / beate them well toge¦ther / then wet the sponge well therein / and laye it vpon the place / wher the payne is. After that make him a playster hereof vpon hys loynes / that be halfe an elle longe / and a quarter of an elle broad: Take the leaues of Roses well brayed / the meel of Lentils / mixe them well together / that it become like a playster / laye that vpon hys loynes. When it is drye / then put more of the foresayde oyle thereto / and moystē it inough therewyth / and laye it vp agayne: thesame taketh awaye ye payne well / and geue hym thys drinke fastinge / the weyght of a quarter of an vn∣ce: Take the sedes of a Gourde made to pouder / Cumin beaten / and the se∣des of Malowes of eche lyke muche / so that they be together a quarter of an vnce / seth them in two vnces of milke of Asses in a newe pott. If ye can haue no milke of Asses / then take in stede thereof milke of a Kowe or Neet / thesame is good also. It is to be knowen / that milke is holsome for all them that haue thys di¦sease / dronke in the morninge / and eaten in the daye. Geue hym also to eate suppes of Almonde / and the yolkes of soft egges potched in hote water. ¶Whan a man pisseth bloude. Pissinge of bloud and hys causes and sig∣nes.THesame commeth somtyme from the bladder / somtyme of the ly∣uer / or els of the veynes that are in the backe. If it commeth of the bladder / then stinketh the vrine / and is troubled / and the bloud is coloured lyke matter / and a man hath payne aboute hys preuye
membres. But if it commeth from the lyuer / then is the bloud very thynne / he hath payne in his right syde. But if it commeth frō his loynes or reynes / then hath he payne in the back and reines. And if it commeth of superfluous bloude / then are hys eyen greate / and then let him bloude in the liuer veyne in the righte arme. But if it commeth from the loynes / then let him bloude by the ankle aboue ye foote / if it is a woman: but if it is a man / let him bloud vnder the foote. Somtyme fortuneth it / that the veynes that passe betwene the flankes & bladder / do breake or remoue out of their place / so yt a man pisseth bloude therof / thesame may ye helpe of this wise: Ye must first let him bloud in the liuer veyne vpon ye right hand / & the pacient must beware of womē: for it is not good / & might bringe him to farther inconuenience: & let him beware of all chafing meates / but eat cooling meates that are good of digestion. It happeneth somtyme also that a man pisseth bloude / when he hath ta∣ken stronge medicines for the stone / speciallye when he hath taken the wyn¦ges and head of Cantarides / (whiche are grene wormes / sheninge with a glosse lyke golde / and a scale lyke a bittel.) To thesame geue freshe Akornes made to pouder to drinke wyth wine. ¶When a man pisseth matter. IF ye will knowe / whether it be of the grauel or stone / then gather a deal of the vrine in a vessel / & let it satle sixe houres.Pissinge of mat∣ter and his cure. After yt streyne it through a linnen cloth / and that remayneth in the cloth / take with thy finger / and if ye find ether stone or grauel / then is the matter also of the grauel or stone. Suche a diseased must ye helpe of thys wyse: Take yt lesse Shauing girss / called also Cattes tayle / and Earth yuy / of eche two handfull / and two vn∣ces of Akornes beaten to pouder / & halfe an vnce of the huske whereby they hange at the tre / and as much of egges shales burnt tyll they be whyle: seth these with thre pintes of wine / and a pint of water / tyll the fourth parte is sodden away. Drinke therof in the morninge / after diner / and at nighte / at eche tyme two egges shales full / and do it so longe tyll the paciēt be whole. And if ye haue not inough / then make more. And if he hath ought / or is di∣seased with the freting or briseling stone withall / then geue him at euery ty∣me as much of Ciche peasebroth withall / and let him drinke them together. ¶When a man can not pisse / how the bladder ought be purged of her superfluous slimishnesse. When a man is diseased in hys bladder / then hath he these signes:Disease of the bladder and the signes of it. He thinketh he is satisfyed of meat or drinke / nother hath lust to eate / and the meate bullketh vp agayne / somtime is he ouer hote / somtime ouer colde / ne¦ther hath any quiet slepe / the vrine strayneth him: in his belly is he also / as though he were swollen. Helpe thesame of this wise: Take Fenel sede / kar∣nels of Persely / Radice / Louage / the rootes of Cariottes / seth them verye well in water / strayne thē through a cloth: then put whyt wyne therto / seth thesame wyth pepper / put thys to the fyrst broth / and seth it agayn / and put
it into a pot / and drinke thereof fastinge seuen morninges one after ye other / and ye shalbe whole without hurte. ¶Thys folowyng causeth to pisse easely. TAke Horse radice as muche as two egges / slice it small / and seth it in a pint of water very well:To pisse easelye. strayne it through a cloth into a pott / and put as much hony therto / as is the rote: this may he drinke when he wil. Or els take Horse radice / as much as two fystes / slice it small / stampe it / & put ther∣to thre tymes as much course branne: then put two quartes of water to it / and seth it till the water be sodden in. Then laye the pacient vpon this with his belly dounward / as warme as he can suffre it: then warme it agayn wt the water / and of this shall he be caused lightely to make water. If a childe had the grauel or stone / & might not therefore make his wa∣ter / then take a handfull of Akornes / and braye them a litle / seth them wyth a quarte of water tyll the thirde part be consumed:The gra∣uel or sto¦ne of a chylde. then strayne it through a cloth / and when that waxeth colde / geue it the chylde to drinke / as much it will / and it shall helpe him. This doth also make lightely pisse and easely: Take the rotes of Persely the herbe of Dasye / and seth them in water / and geue him thereof to drinke in the mornynge and eueninge. Or els put therto distilled water of Radice / that maye he drinke when he will. Or els geue him the eyes of Crabbes ma¦de to pouder to drinke with wine. And if it is a chylde / that it can not pisse for the stone / then geue hym it wyth milke to drinke. Another to make easelye pisse: Take Persely / Smalage / Fenel / of lyke quantitie / chap them / and bray them small / and seth them a litle: put butter thereto / & lay it vpon his preuy membre and loynes / as warme as he can suf¦fre it: of that shall he make his water easely. Or els take Smalage chapped small / as much as two fystes with ones as much course branne / and seth that with water / till it waxe drye: laye the same vpon the bladder. Thesame is good for him / yt maketh his water payn fully / and thynketh that hys belly be swollen: and is specially good for them that are grosly stopped in the bladder / for thereby do they pisse. ¶For to pisse easelye / and for the stiche and smartynge / and for the Brisynge stone. TAke two slices of a Garlyke heade / pill them / and braye them well: thē take a good handfull of Malowes wyth the rootes / wash them fayre / chappe them small / put them together into a newe pot / put a quart of wine thereto / seth it well halfe an houre / scomme it well / and beware that it do not runne ouer / strayne it through a cloth into a pot / and put therto two vn¦ces of suger: and when it is colde / then drinke therof when nede requireth / specially in ye morning & euening / at eche tyme a good draught / holde a pece of tosted bread before hys mouth / lest he perbreake. This forsayd drinke is specially good for thē / whose bladder is vncleane or stopped / ether of the grauel / stone or vncleane slimye matter / wherefore
he can not make his water: for thys drincke mollifieth it / openeth the con∣dute / and maketh sone to pisse. But if a man were sore vnclene / that he had ben long without makinge of his water / & thereof had he gotten a greping or sore / or were febled / or els had a wambling and perbreaking / thesame helpe thus without payne: Ma¦ke him a bagge of soft linnen cloth a quarter of an elle broade / that it maye reache about his body / from the nauell tyll the priuy membres / and take ij. quartes of brann / water cresses chapped small as much / put the together in to a bagge & laye them in water: but let the back be quilted / lest the branne cluster / and seth it well. After that take the bagge out / and let it drop well / and laye it as warme vpon his loynes / as he can suffre it▪ yt taketh awaye ye griping and payne anone. If ye can get no water cresse / then take the bran alone. Or els take ij. ryles full of yarme / & seth thē well with water & ashes / & lay the yarme as warme about him as he can suffre it. Or els take a shert seth it in ashes / & holde it before him / and winde it about his body & loynes / that is good and helpeth him well: yet is the firste yt best. After that set him vpon a stole wyth a hole / and take a pot / and put two stones gloynge hote / as bigge as a fyst / sett the pott vnder in the stole / sit thereon / so yt the vapour maye go no where out / & poure alwaye a dish ful of water theron / & let that vapour stryke vp into the / as warme as ye can suffre it. And if the stones be not hote inough / then take more stones / yt they maye cast heate inough / yt ye maye sweat therof. If it is a man / then maye he take yt forsayd drinke made wyth the garlyke before the bath / and bind the bagge about his loynes / for that helpeth very well. This maye also be well vsed alone / for it doth helpe alone also / and lightely to pisse without hurt. But if a man can not make his water / or els pisseth very litle / then take a newe brickstone / that neuer was wett / and make it gloyng hote / and seth Cumin in good wyne / and poure the wyne and Cumin vpon the hote sto∣ne / and set it vnder the / and let the vapour stryke vp into the / & the warmth and pissinge shall come agayne to the. Or els take water Cresses sodden in wyne in a newe pott / sitte vpon it as warme as ye can sfre it / thesame causeth to make water well / and is also experimented. Or els take a good handfull of the rootes of the herbe called Ononis or Resta bouis in Latine / and seth them in a good quarte of wine / and geue him thereof to drinke in the morning / at none / and to bedward. But if it is winter / that ye can not haue the rootes / then take the toppet of an onyon / and put thesame into the mans yarde: or els take the innermoste heades of onyons / and gather them together / and put him then into the yarde. But if ye haue not that nother / then take two or thre lyce / so great as ye can gett / and put them into the yarde / into the innermost hole / that goeth into the bo¦ye / and put a litle cloth therein / that they maye crepe in / and he shall make water verye well. ¶When a man hath the Stranguria / that is difficultye to make water / or when one pisseth in hys bedde in the nighte.
AGaynst the Stranguria take Malowes / Garlyke / of eche a handful bruse them / & seth them in a quarte of wine / tyll the thyrde yart be sod¦den away / drinke therof thre tymes in a daye. Or els eate yt kernels of Pa¦ches and Akornes made to pouder of eche a like / mixe that with wine / and drinke it: if he be not healed therewyth / then hath he the stone. When a yonge body doth pisse in his bedde / ether oft ether seldom / if ye will helpe him / take the bladder of a Goate / drye it / that it maye be made to pouder / thesame pouder ought to be geuē to drinke with wine. Or els take ye beanes or hinderfallinges of Goates / braye thē to pouder / & geue him of ye pouder in his meate in ye morning & euening / a quarter of an vnce at euerye tyme: Or els geue him a quarter of an vnce or more of Agrimonye / wyth a litle wine or broth sayth Bartholomeus de Montagnana: Or els geue him Hedghogges or Orchens made to pouder at euē to bedward in a draughte of wine this flesh is also wounderfully good eaten agaynst that. Or els take the pouder that Montagnana setteth in his Antidotarius / namely: Take halfe an vnce of the inner skinne of a hennes mawe / yt ashes of a burnt Hedghogge thre quarters of an vnce / an vnce of Agrimony / stear them together / and geue the pacient therof a quarter of an vnce wyth a lit∣le wine or broth when he goeth to bedde. When a man getteth the Stranguria or difficultye to make water / thē anoynt him his nauel wt suet warmed & no more / & it auoydeth very shortly. Meates cōueniēt for hym that hath the Stran¦guria.Such diseased must beware of salt meates & smoked / as Hering / Ling / Coddes / grene Places / smouth fishes / as Iles / Lāpriles / Barbels / Tēches: also must he beware of fat meates as bacō / pasteys or pyes / fatt chese / raw milke: But they may wel eate Pykes / Perches / Troutes & such like fishes / breding in running waters. Let him also eschue all water foles / both wilde and tame. Let him eate the flesh of kiddes / potage of great Peasen / the roo∣tes of Persely / Fenel / the herbe or sede of Smalage / beaten barly. He must also not eat his fill / and beware of fruytes. He maye also make a bath of the floures of Camomille / Water cresses / Malowes / Betony / Cinckfoly / of ech a handfull: seth these well close / & bath therin vntill aboue the nauel. If ye wil make it yet better / thē put therto the herb of marrish Malow or Holyhoke / Cinckfoly / Ferne / seth of eche a handful / and boyle it wt ye firste bath. This bath is very good for the Strāguria / & causeth to pisse well. Let him beware of ouermuch heat / let him drinke good whyte wine / & sodden swete wine to bedward / & in the morning an houre before breakfast / & tem∣per it a litle with water / wherin is sodden a quarter of an vnce of Lettuse sede / beaten Licoris halfe an vnce / a handful of ye leaues of Hertes tounge: seth these in thre pintes of water / vntill the thirde part be sodden awaye. ¶Of the stone / howe he that hath it / maye be healed wyth conuenient medicines. SOmtime doth the stone engendre in the bladder / somtime in the loynes. Somtime doth it engendre of vnclene slymy matter / that is gathered in the stomake / and is congeled together with an vnclene slymy heate / and so waxeth a stone or grauel / which causeth great payne and grefe. Whan the stone groweth in the loynes / then aketh his back and loynes /
and be somtymes as dead. But if the stone is engendred in the bladder / thē hath he payn in ye forpart of hys body / & he can not wel make hys water. Somtyme commeth the stone of heat / & then is his vrine reade / & in the bottome of the chambre pott or vrinal lyeth much grauel or sande / if it stand an houre still: and that grauel or sand is read and hard when it is touched. Suche a pacient must beware of all hote medicines. But if the stone is engendred of colde / then doth the paciente perbreake oft / and the sande synkinge in the bottom / is whyte. His vrine is somtyme clere / and somwhat yelowe / as the whey of chese: and to suche one are hote medicines good. This disease is cured somtime by cuttinge Chirurgeons experte in that thinge. But that the grauel or sandy stone maye be voyded frō a man / that he maye be ridde of the payne or smarte / or yet the perbreakinge: ye muste first se that the pacient be purged of the vnclene slymy fylth / and yt he haue good sieges / & geue him this syrop to drinke: Take the rootes of Smalage / Fenel & Persely / of ech foure in nombre / & of their sedes an vnce / Grummel two vnces / smal Trifle an vnce & a quarter / yt sedes of Chiches & Pōpones of eche an vnce / an vnce of ye sede of ye sharp Burres or Clotes / the herbe of Pinke nedle or Cranes bill / Colonder or Maydens heyre / of ech a handfull / sixe vnces of ye rotes of Brak of yt wal or Polipody: chap al ye rotes & herbes smal / & seth thē in a quart of wine / & a quart of water to the halfe: after that streyne it through a cloth / and deale it in two partes / & to the one part put a pounde of hony / and seth it alwaye to the halfe / and to the other parte put a pounde of suger / & a quarter and a halfe of an vnce of Cantarides withoute heades and winges / made to pouder / and seth thys the thyrde part awaye. Of this geue to the pacient at euery fourth day an vnce and an halfe / with thre vnces of water / wherein are sodden ye rootes of Smalage & Persely / & of the fyrst syrop made wyth hony / geue him euery morning an vnce and an halfe / mixt with foure vnces of water made of the rotes afore specified: and of the other syrop / at euery fourth daye an vnce and an halfe / mixt with iiij. vnces of the foresayd water / & then recouereth he. And if he can not be hea∣led there with / and that the stone were great and hard: then were nothing better / then to cut it / if weakenesse dyd not hinder it. He that hath had payne of the stone a gret season / or els an vnclene blad¦der / wherof he hath had a payne or shuting in his coddes: or els hath a swel∣linge aboue his preuye membres: if ye will helpe thesame / then bath him as hote / as they be costumed to be bathed / which are greued of the stone. After that take milke / and seeth thesame with egges / and drinke thesame bloude warme in the morning and euening / & ye shall perceyue very vnclene fylth to auoyde from you / both in the sieges / and vrine: Do this a fourten night / and it shall auoyde. If ye will breake spedelye the stone / that he do bruse / take the Goates bloude / put it into a glasse / and set it in the sonne to drye: after that braye it small to pouder. Take euerye eueninge to beddeward of the same pouder a quarter of an vnce with wine: and of this shall the stone be brused / that it maye auoyde without hurt. And whan it auoydeth now from him / then let him eate both in the morning and euening vpon a slyce of bread the sede of
Persely / and Grummel or Graye mill made to fyne pouder: but the breade must be dipped or wet before in wine. Herewyth is the stone hindered to growe any more / for it driueth it out and bruseth it. Lyke operation hath al¦so the bloude of an Hare / and specially when he is drouned in vinegre. ¶A confection for the Stone. TAke the pouder of an Hare / burnt in a pott with skinne and heere / so yt nothing be taken from it:A confe∣ction for the stone of this pouder take an vnce and an hale / and vi. vnces of hony / & of this make a confection. Hereof take euery morning & euening as much as a chest nut / and ye shall finde yt the stone shall breake & auoyde frō you. But if the rubbel or shardes of the stone do put the to payn / then vse that bath / wherof I haue spoken before. Take the rotes of Persely and herbe / the herbe of Fenel with the rotes / Dyll with the rootes / Smalage with the rootes / of ech a handfull / and of eche sede a handfull: chap the rotes and herbes small / and put them alltoge∣ther into a small fyne linnē bagge / seth thē well in water yt space of an hour / & make a bath therof / & bath therein. Then lay the bagge a whyle vpon the backe / as warme as ye can suffre it / after that vpon the belly likewyse: after that sit vpon the bagge also as warme as ye can suffre it. And of thys wyse bath in the morning thre houres / at after none two houres / and at night to bedward. Do this thre dayes / and vse to eate the rotes of Persely / and the sede of Smalage / and the sede of Persely / of eche an vnce / make pouder of thē / put thereto two vnces of suger / & when thou wilt depart frō the table / then dippe a slice of bread in wine / & strowe as much of this pouder theron / as a chest nutte. Eat this also in the morning fasting / & to bedward: & thus shall the stone auoyde frō thy without any smart or payne / & ye shall make water easely. But beware of all thinges that engendre the stone. ¶A good commune bath for the stone. TAke a bushel of Walwurt chapped small / put it into a bagge / and seth it in water / bath in the same water nyne dayes / and the stone shal sone breake. But if the stone is in the bladder / then let him laye the bagge before him vnder his nauel: & if it is in ye loynes / then laye the bagge behind at his backe / or els where the stone greueth him: this doth ease without hurte. ¶A bath to breake the stone. TAke sixe buckettes of water / put thereto two pounde of Wild or Horse radish rotes sliced small & beaten / put thē into a bagge / & seth thē wel in water in a kettel or pot / then put altogether to the other water: but ye may not bath to hote / nother let the water passe your hart / or els should ye waxe faynte. It were good also he dyd drinke water of Horse radice / when he ba¦teth / and also before and after the bath: for that also driueth out the stone. ¶Thys folowyng is also good for the stone.
Take a kidney of an Hare / burne it to pouder / braye it small / and drinke therof in the morninge and euening / at eche tyme half a quarter of an vnce with Persely water / or els water of Horse radice rote. Or els take the rotes of Horse radice cut checkerwyse / like to dice / the weight of foure vnces / pou¦re ouer them a good quarte of the best wine yt ye can get / and let it stande a daye and a night: after that drinke thereof in the morning and eueninge / at eche tyme foure vnces. Thesame driueth out the stone in the bladder & ray∣nes / preserueth a man from payne of the bladder and raynes / withstandeth perbreaking. Some do digge a pott in the grounde / with the Horse radice roote / the depth of a kne Or els take commun radice rotes / let them stande in the earth / but pare of the vttermost croune next to the herbe / and make it holowe / then laye the croune agayne vpon the roote. If a water be gathe∣red therein / take and vse thesame: for it is very good for the Stranguria / & for them that do make their water wyth difficultye and droppinge / but spe∣cially for the stone in the bladder. ¶A good true medecine for the stone / whiche is good and approued for commune people. TAke the berries of Iuy / beate them to pouder / and drinke therof in the morninge and eueninge / at eche tyme a quarter of an vnce with an vn¦ce and an halfe of wine. This hath driuen from women stones as bigge / some as a dowes egge / some as Walnuttes / some as chastnuttes / some as fylberts or smaler / and that with payn and trauayl. ¶Another true science for the grauel / when one drinketh therof in the morninge and euenynge at eche time an vnce / or an vnce and an halfe. TAke the huskes wherein Beanes haue growen / and burne them to as∣shes: of thesame ashes make a lie / and drinke it as is sayd before. Planteyne sodden in wine / and dronke / draweth out the stone / and a∣uoydeth the disease of pissinge / called Dysuria / beyng soddē in a litle bagge / and layd warme vpon the belly. ¶Of Agues / and fyrst howe he maye be cured that is ouertaken wyth Ephemera. Ephemera is a feuer so called / because it is apte to be cured in one daye / but if it is not regarded / turneth to sundery kindes of agues or feuers. This disease happeneth somtyme of the Sonne heate / whereby the head waxeth hoter then anye other membres. Somtime commeth it of excesse of colde / and then becommeth a man redish vnder hys eyen / & his body waxeth cold outwardly / & the head heuy. Somtime commeth it with surfettinge wyth meates or drinkes that be hote or colde / and thereof waxeth hys vrine reed. Somtime happeneth it of anger / & then waxeth his face reed / and his eyen drawe forwarde / and turne very swyftlye in his heade. Also doth it happen
by heauinesse and greate perplexitye and aduersitye / and then do his eyen syncke in his head / and loketh grimly / and hys body waxeth feble / and hys pulse beateth fayntly. When the ague commeth by the Sonne heate / then set the pacient a lit¦le in a bloud warme bath the second / or at the last the thyrd daye / that he do sweat therein: After that set him in a coole place / and there strowe leaues & braunches of Wylowes / and stype Myrte beries in oyle of Violettes / and strake thesame oyle into hys nose thrilles / and take oyle of Roses and vine∣gre of lyke quantitie / beate them well together / & anoynte his temples & for head therwith / & the wrestes of his handes & fete. Geue him to drinke milk of Poppy sede / made of this wise: Put water to ye sede / then beat it / & mixe it with water / yt it become like an almond milke / & strayn it through a cloth into a glasse / & geue him it to drinke when he wil go to bed / in the morning & in the day tyme a good draught. Ye must also coole him first: and whē he is otherwhyles thyrsty / geue him bread stiped in colde water to eat / and he must beware of all such thinges as maye chafe him / if he drinketh wine / let him alaye it well / or let it be soure. If the ague commeth or is caused by colde / & that the pacient beginneth to consume / then set him aboue a tobbe with hote water / wherin are soddē Camomille floures / Dyll & Basil: put also of that water into a pot / & let the pacient receiue the vapour of it into his body beneth & at the mouth. Or els set him in a tobbe with the forsayd herbes / that were better for him: Or els make him a bath with the forsaid herbes / and let him warme himselfe wel / after that anoint him well with oyle of Dyll / for thesame is good and con∣uenient for him. If the ague commeth by heuynesse or mourninge / or a drye occasiō / then set his fete in warme water / vntill his knees / wherein is sodden Camomill and Dyll / of eche two handfull / and couer the tobbe well / that the vapoure maye stryke well into his body / as is sayde before / and through the mouth. Let his legges also be rubbed dounwarde / for that doth him much good / af¦ter that let him walke / or vse some other conuenient exercise: he must also be¦ware for taking cold / & eat meates yt warme him moderatly / & be good of di¦gestion / he must also beware of eating and drinking vnmeasurably. If the ague is caused of hote meates or drinkes / then geue hym Oxiza∣cra with milke of Poppysede or Sorell. When the ague beginneth to fayle / then geue him the seconde or thyrde daye to drinke water distilled out of ye rootes of broade Planteyn / thre mor¦ninges one after another / at eche tyme an vnce and an halfe / or two vnces / and make him an Epithema / that is a medicine vpon the liuer of thys wise: take two vnces of Endiue water / an vnce of water Cicory / and halfe an vn¦ce of water of Roses / mixe these together / and dippe towe of Hempe therin / and laye it vpon the liuer. Let him also eate meates of good digestiō as are yonge Mottons / Lambes / Chyckens / Hogges fete / and such like. Let him eschue salt meates / and be sobre in eating and drinking: and after meate let him vse moderate walkinge or stearing / where good ayer is / and so shall he recouer easely and well. If the ague is caused of heauinesse or greate aduersitye or distresse /
then must the grefe be taken awaye with frendlinesse & good conuersacion with mirth and such pastimes and recreations / as maye reioyce him / and not longe remayne in one place / but let him abyde wher good ayer is / & vse to bath somtyme. After yt he hath rested / & will cloth him / then anointe him with oyle of Roses or oyle of Violettes. Let him washe somtime in warme water / & when he wil cloth him / then anoynt him as before. Let him also be chast / & his meates & drinkes of good digestion / that do also mollify & coole him. He maye not vse stronge drinkes / but Barly water to bedward / thesa∣me mollifieth and cooleth him: hote meates do hurte him. ¶Of the hote and feruent ague / called Causon. FEbris caustica is / when the Colera perisheth in the veines that are neare the harte / and them that are aboue in the stomake / liuer and lightes or poulmon. It is caused of a feruent heate / and the pacient hath exceding heate and thyrste. This disease is of two sortes: ye one is of a single Colera / the other ouertaketh moste chefelye ionge folke / when their body is drye. When their vrine is scommy / then be sure / that they are costiffe and bounde about the hart / and get a great disease and payne in the head. The vrine of them both is reed / and they waxe feble. Ye muste purge and clense them with pilles or laxatine / but they must be mollified before wt syropes of Violettes / or syropus acetosus / and with Electuariū de succo Ro¦sarum / or Diaprunis laxatinus / so yt they be strong inough / or yt ye age do not hinder thē / if he hath much vnclene matter in him. If he be greatly thyrsty / thē geue him otherwhyles Pōgranates or sorel to suck / & to bedward geue him to drinke syropes of Violettes or Roses / with as much cold water: like wise do at none & in ye morning / & he must beware of such thinges as chafe him: he must also be let bloud in ye liuer veyne. Let him drinke wine / & alaye it well wyth water. His meate muste be meates of good digestion and coo∣ling / nother eate more then nede requireth. If his belly is bounde / then lose it with Cassia fistula / syropes of Violet∣tes / & Endiue water: make him a clister with ye iuice of Branke vrsine / Tri∣fle / herbe of Violettes & Malowes / without the age / the time / the strength or the region or countrey do hinder the. If he hath payn in ye head / thē make him this sointment / & anoint his tē¦ples & forhead therewith: take oyle of roses / the iuice of Porcelain / vinegre / of eche an vnce / beat thē well together / & when ye will vse it / beat it agayn / and make him a plaister therof vpon the forhead and temples. Take read Saunders / Roses / Barly meel of lyke quantitie: put thereto as much Rose water / that ye may mixe the other thinges therwith / & make a past thereof / & put the iuyce of Gourd therto if ye can get it: This alayeth the payne sone and well. Or els take Poppye sede / and beate it verye well / temper it wyth water / and geue hym alwaye a litle thereof to drinke / and specially in the night: and wett a linnen cloth therin / and binde it vpon hys forheade. But if he can not slepe / thē take Lettice sede beatē / Almondes beaten / ye iuice of Lettice / of ech an vnce / water of Roses / oyle of Roses / of eche halfe
an vnce / mixe these very well together like a playster / & binde it aboute hys head: and when it is drye / then wett it agayne / and he shall fal to slepe. And if the payne go away / then geue him to eat Gourdes & Porceleyne / & when he will go to bed / then let him washe his fete in warme water / and rub hys legges well beneth dounwarde / and afterward renche them in cold water. After that let him lye doune / and leaue his fete vncouered / and so draweth the heat out dounwarde: Let him do to his handes lykewise. If he waxeth faynt in the night for heat / then take water of Roses / and halfe so much vinegre / in thesame wet two clothes / eche so muche as a fyst / and geue him thē in his hande / tyll they waxe hote: thesame draweth out al the heate. Rub the soles of his fete therwith also & his wrestes / for it geueth him good strength. Geue him confecte of suger in his mouth / or els confecte of Cheris / or of soure Plummes / thesame slake his thyrst. If a woman were diseased hereof / & were bigge wyth chyld / the forsaid medecine might be geuen her wel inough without danger. But if one were thus diseased / and a yexing toke him / or a goute / and it lasted foure & twen∣ty houres or more / that is a sure token of death. ¶Of chylderen diseases. MOrbilli and Variole is a disease that noyeth childrē greatly / called Poc¦kes and Masers. They that haue the Pockes / if ye geue them water wherein Rew or Herbe grace is sodden with Fumitorye to drinke / it doth helpe them without dout. Great inconuenience get chyldren with these di∣seases / and specially the Pockes: for they straye ouer all the bodye / and the eyes also / and when theyr eyen do itche / they waxe lightely blind therof. If ye will saue them that they ware not blinde / hange the rootes of Rew and Scabiose at their necke / and they shalbe safe. ¶Of the dayly ague or feuer quotidiant. THe ague or feuer that taketh a man euerye daye / is caused of Flegma / when it falleth into the bloud and veines / thē doth the ague shake one / and the colde is great. But when it is without the veines / then hath the pa¦cient colde euery day / and the shakinge nor frost is not so great. This ague haue most communly aged folke / and such as are colde or moyst of comple∣xion. It taketh them also chefely / that are ydle / and vse excesse / and specially them / that eat or drinke out of season / wherewyth engendre wythin them many colde humors. When the pacient is very thyrsty / and his body is drye / then is his ague caused of salt flegma / wherfore geue him such thinges / as drawe out moyst¦nes / and set his fete in warme water / wherein are sodden Dill and Camo∣mille: and when hys fete are dried agayn by themselues / then take salt and oyle of Violettes / of like quantitie / and rub the soles of his fete therewyth. He must be purged also wt such medecines / as purge flegma: for if the paciēt is diseased by the flegma / then is the disease more durable. He that hath the dayly feuor or ague / nother can be quit of it / thesame is
a token / that he hath corrupte bloude in his backe. To ease thesame / were it good to set horseleches to his backe / his legges & armes neare to his hādes. ¶A good drinke for the dayly feuer. TAke the barkes of Miscelden growyng vpon okes half a quarter of an vnce / geue him yt beaten to pouder to drinke wt a quarter of an vnce of Aqua vite / while the shaking is vpon him:A good drinke for the Quotidi∣an or day¦ly feuer. thesame driueth away ye iaundis frō him / & also the whirling in the head. Wherfore saith Hipocrates: he yt ma¦keth Misceldē to pouder / & taketh it wt Aqua vite / thesame driueth awaye ye dayly feuer / or els ye iaundis / ye whirling in ye heade & the feuer Hectica / that is / asatled feuer or ague / wherewith men do whyrle and be dismade. The Tertiane or third dayes feuer commeth of the heat of the liuer / the Quartane or fourth dayes feuer cōmeth of Melancoly / ye colour of his vrine is like water and clere. But the colour of the Quotidiane or daylye feuer is most parte reed and clere. The colour of the Tertiane vrine is reed & thyck. These vrines haue most part a litle some in the circle lyke Percely: But the some of the Tertiane / yt cōmeth of ye liuer / is somthing yalowe / because it commeth of the heat of the gall. His mouth is bitter / and his face reed colo∣red / his vrine is thinne. Anoynte his heade wyth oyle of Roses and vinegre mixte together. This folowyng is also very good agaynst ye dayly feuer: Take Euphor∣bium made to pouder the sixtenth part of an vnce / tempered with an egges shell full of Aqua vite / geue the pacient this thre dayes together to drinke in the morning fasting: thesame purgeth the slyme / wherby the ague hath hys nourture. This slyme may be voyded of this wyse also: Take the rote of an Elder tre / wash it well & clene / then pare the vpper shell softly from it / after ye shaue of yt other shell vntil ye wood or hardnes / a quarter of an vnce / bray yt small / beat it wt an egges shell full of Aqua vite / & geue it ye paciēt. Or els seth of the inner shell or barcke of Elder tre a hand full in a quarte of ale or bier / till the halfe be sodden awaye and drinke that / this is experimented. He that hangeth the roote of Valeriane grene at his necke / if she waxe sere / then goeth the ague from him. He that feareth / he shall get the ague / let him swalowe in thre cornes of Coriander fastinge / and it shall go awaye: and let this be done before the a∣gue fall vpon him. If he shall haue colde wyth it / then is it good also to take thre rootes of Veruayne / and thre leaues of it / sodden in wine / and dronke before the cold do ouertake him / and he shalbe quit of it. He / whose feuer cōmeth of Melācoly / his vrine is first whyt / afterward black / when nature beginneth to digest. He yt hath this disease / let him eate freshe meates / and purge him selfe twyse euery weke wyth leaues of Sena tre made to pouder / and taken in the morninge and eueninge at eche tyme a quarter of an vnce wyth a peasebroth. Geue him also to drinke of thys syroppe folowynge as ofte he will: Take a handfull of Cicory rootes / and a hande full of Cicorye floures / and two leaues of Hartes tounge / seth them wt a quarte of water tyll the third part be sodden away: thē streyne it
through a cloth into a pot / and put an vnce of suger thereto. Thys syrop is very good in sommer / for it clenseth the bloude / and slaketh thyrste / and coo¦leth wel / it mollifieth also the harde matter / that is gathered about the hart of congeled bloud / wherof do somtyme grow apostemes or consuming cou∣ghes: it driueth awaye iaundis also / and mollifyeth sieges that a man maye the easyer haue thē. But if hys heade woulde ake / then geue him pilles that purge the heade / as pillule de iera picra / or pillule Cochie. ¶An approued science for the ague / it riddeth a man oft in thre dayes. An ap∣proued science for the ague.TAke the rotes of Celendine / chappe them small / and braye them whyle they be grene. Take as muche thereof as a walnut / steare them wyth a dishe full of warme mylke or wyne / or wyth a dishe full of warme pease broth: thys oughte to be done in the morninge fastinge / and refrayne from eatynge and drinkinge / foure houres after: and if he can go / let hym walke vpon it. The nexte daye geue hym Diacartami / halfe an vnce or more: but if he hath greate heate / then geue hym Diaprunis laxatiui halfe an vnce or more / and if hys strength can beare it / geue hym halfe an vnce Electuarij de succo rosarum. Signes of an ague come of Flegma.If the feuer is come of Flegma / and the pacient is aged / and the season drye / or yet colde and moyst / and hys pulse in hys arme beateth slackly / and hys vrine is muche and whyte / he also is greately thyrstye: these are signes of the ague that commeth of Flegma. Geue to that pacient the iuyce of Cla¦rye / the iuyce of Smalache / the iuyce of Fenell made lyke an Electuary. Let not the paciente eate nor drincke / whyle he hath colde or heate. After that geue hym a litle meat / that warmeth measurably: the nexte daye geue hym som meat good of digestion / as small byrdes / and suche lyke / lette hys drinke be clene wyne. Or els geue hym Diacartami halfe an vnce or thre quarters. Item suppinges of Amilum made with cow milke / & a litle saffron com¦forte nature / & geue a good coloure / and strengthen the pacient. Likewyse maye ye make him Rice potage. If he is sore cooled and febled / thē seth him a dish full of Cumin / wyth a yolke of an egge / thesame maye he drinke colde or warme / that strengtheneth hym very well. ¶For the Iaundis. HE that hath the iaundis / muste beware of all meates or drinckes that coole him / for they hurte him. But if the iaundis doth greue him / then make hym thys drinke: Take a peny weight of beaten Saffron / and a pen∣ny weight of Ancolye beaten also / put them into a porenger or wyth vine∣gre / and steare them wel together / put also a litle wine and water to them / that it maye be thynne inough: then let it be dronke fasting / and it breaketh the iaundis withoute hurte. But if the disease woulde differre / and the iaundis woulde not voyde / wherby the paciēt could haue no stomake: if he be stronge inough geue him
Rebarbara made to pouder / temper it with a fresh Peasebroth / and let him drinke it agaynst the daye breake. If he hath strength / then let him walke after it / and holde a tosted pece of bread before his mouth / and fast two hou¦res vpon it. Thys purgeth Colera an Flegma / whereof come the ague and the iaundis: or els wydeth it the stomake aboue / whereby the stomake is clensed of slyme and the iaundis. But if he could not do it / or that it dyd yrke hym to take the Rebarbara / then geue hym halfe an vnce of Diasene / the one halfe at nighte / the other halfe in the morninge / and let thys be beatē wyth a Peasebroth / or els swa∣lowed in wyth a rosted apple or soure thynge / thesame purgeth also. But if hys head dyd ake of colde / then anoynte hys heade / forheade and tempels wyth oyle of Camomille / and put into his nose oleum benedictum / and a litle into hys eares also / and make him a fote bath with floures of Ca¦momille / thesame chafeth the bloude and heade very well. But if he hath a moyst heade / then cause him to nise / and let hym take the roote of Piretrum / that is Walworte in hys mouth / and chawe it: the same draweth out the moystnesse out of the heade / and geue hym Cinamō / Coriander / Zeduaria or Nutmegges to eate. It is good also / that he that hath a colde ague / which hath lasted longe / wherewith a man is greatly cooled / that he (I saye) be well anoynted the back / the loynes / and the belly wyth oyle of Bayes / and oyle of Iuniper of eche lyke muche agaynste a good fyre / that it be well rubbed in. Do this in the morninge and eueninge / for it chafeth the veines and wythstandeth the ague. ¶Another true science agaynst the ague. TAke the grene braunches of Elder / and pill the vpper shell of / and take the nexte grene shell / braye it well / put halfe so muche good vi¦negre thereto / mixe that together / then strayne it through a cloth / and drinke halfe an egges shell full thereof fastinge thre mornings: thesame dryueth awaye the ague wythout hurt. ¶An other proued science for the ague / that hath lasted longe / speciallye when a man hath gotten it of an euell stomake. TAke also the braunches of Elder / the former parte / pyll the vpper∣most shell sofftely of / after that shaue of the grene / cut that small / and braye it well in a morter / put as muche vinegre thereto / and braye it there with / streyne it through a cloth in a glasse / and geue a patient thereof thre morninges fastynge / at euery tyme a spounful to drin¦ke / and let him faste sixe houres vpon it. Thys voyded the stomacke well of the agues occasions. He that hath the disease that commeth of hote bloude / hys heade doth ake / he is hote and heauye / hys temples are swollen / and hys eyen stande forwarde. He is not thyrstye / and in the night appeare before hys eyen read
thynges / hys pulse is swyft / and in hys slepe do all his veynes beate sore. He that is so diseased / ought to be let bloud in the lyuer veyne in the arme / and the next in the right hande vpon the thombe in the veyne of the head / and the sixt daye betwene the litle finger on the right hande in the harte veyne / and the nynth daye in both the fete without / aboue the ankles / nother must he let to muche bloud in any of the veynes. But it must be consydered whe∣ther he hath strength inough / whether the age is cōuenient for it / and whe∣ther the season doth agre to it. If anye thynge shoulde hinder the letting of bloud / then must his bloud be cooled wyth these thynges / namely wyth water / wherein is sodden Psy¦lium / that is Flewurt / and wyth a litle milke of Poppy sede / this oughte to be geuen him to drincke. Geue him also a syrope of Violettes / and water / where in are sodden black Cheries. But if his belly were to harde / then ought it to be mollifyed herewyth: Take Barly a good handfull brayed / and seth it in a pint of water / put ther to a litle butter / and a litle salte / and a litle Saunder / mixte wyth a litle su∣ger / and geue him otherwhiles a slyce of bread / that hath ben stiped in that water: thesame mollifyeth his body and bloud / nother oughte he to drincke any other wyne / then that be sower / and well mixte with barly water. Lay otherwhyles vpon his nauel butter / as bigge as a beane / and laye a thinne dishe vpon thesame / tyll the butter be saked in. And if strength can beare it / and that it doth not greue him / then geue him a purgacion with a confecte de succo rosarum / and geue him the night before syropes of Violettes / that he maye be mollifyed before / and he shall haue easy sieges. But if he hath heade ake / then anoynt his heade herewyth: Take halfe an vnce of oyle of roses / a quarter of an vnce of vinegre halfe a drame of Bo¦lus armeny made to pouder / mixe them well together / and anoynt his for∣head therewyth / and his temples and throte. Then take a dish full of colde water / and put therein as muche vinegre / and wette a cloth therein / lyke a bande of thre fingers / wringe it out / and binde it about hys forhead & tem∣ples. And take two clothes / eche as bigge as a fyt / and wette them therein also / and geue hym alwayes one in hys hande / tyll it waxe drye. Wette yet two clothes therein / and binde them about his fete: and whē they are drye / then wet them agayne. This cooleth the bloud / draweth out the euell heat / whereof commeth the headake. But if the headake will not go awaye / nor aswage / then marke by hys vrine and all hys beaucoure / whereof it com∣meth him / and vse theselfe toward hym / as is taught seuerally before of the head ake. It is to be noted / that if the head ake commeth of the stomake / then is he more disquiet after meate then before: Him maye ye helpe of this wyse: Purge hys stomacke wyth a laxatiue / after yt muste he be measurable with eating and drinkinge / accordinge to his complexion. But if the headake be because the pacientes braynes are to moyst / then is he more vnquiet fasting then after meat. If the moystnesse of the braynes is of colde / then geue him somthynge that warmeth the stomacke measurablye / and the pacient must beware of all thinges that coole / and must kepe hys head warme. ¶An experimented science for the feuer quotidiane or dayly feuer.
TAke the best Aqua vite that ye can get / halfe a pounde / put therein the whytest may of Walwurt that ye can get two vnces / leste it stepe there in thre dayes / and geue the paciente thereof to drinke. But marke well / if it woulde chafe hym to muche / then temper him the drincke wyth a litle other wyne / or drinke / and geue hym somtime Manus Christi. ¶A medecine for many kindes of feuers or agues. FIrste prepare suche a draught: Take clensed and washen Barlye two vnces / black Ciche peasen an vnce / Licorice pared small an vnce / grene or seer Fenell a handfull / thre or foure leaues of Her∣tes tonge / two or thre leaues of Wormwood / two or thre rotes of Pimpernell: let al this be sodden in thre quartes of water / tyl the barly doth swell / and if the water doth consume in sething / then poure more water in to it / so that there remayne about two quartes and an halfe of water. After that streyne the water through a cloth / and kepe it. Of that water must the pacient drinke both daye and night when he is thyrstye / saue onely whā he looketh for the shakinge: for then muste he nether eate nor drinke / withoute great necessitie constrayne him. And when the water is fayled / then make more. ¶Howe a man shall behaue himselfe that is thus diseased. OF thys wyse must he guide himselfe that is diseased of thys sycknesse:Hovve the disea¦sed of a Feuer shall be∣haue him¦selfe. he must beware of chese / milke / porke and freshe befe / of all fruyt new or olde. Let him eat potages made wyth Bethes / Spinage / Oetmeel / Bar¦ly / and alwaye put a fewe Almondes beaten thereto: on flesh dayes a quar∣ter of an Henne / or Chikens sodden in water / with Percely / and foure lea∣ues of Lettis. He must beware also for moyst meates and surffettinge. On fishe dayes let him eate Crabbes or Perches / somtime an egge potched in water. Let him drinke no wine / without it be at meale tymes / and that so∣berly / and mixte with ye aforesayd Barly water / or clene water / if the made water were agaynst his stomake: but out of meal tyme let him drinke none other water nor wine / then the aforesayd. When a man knoweth that he shall haue the ague / if it is at after none / then maye he eate somwhat in the morninge about sixe of the clocke / and ta¦ry so / tyll the heat hath forsaken him. If it shall come before breakfast / then let him not eat / tyll the heat be past. Some agues there be / in the which it were good to let bloude after the third daye / accordinge to the pacientes strength / and the season. This is now spokē of the commune agues / and of the Tertiane or third dayes feuer / though there be many kindes of it. If a man hath vsed suche water / as is spoken of before / then let him be∣ware of excesse of meate / and take fastinge the herbe / or the herbe made to pouder / called Centaurea / in English Centory / the bignesse of a walnutt or chest nut / tempered wyth wine / and he maye drinke a litle wyne vpon it / to
tempere hys mouth of the bitternesse. And thus maye he remayne that day. In the morninge / and the two dayes folowyng / let him take thereof in the morning the bicknesse of halfe a Walnutt / wyth thre leaues of Rue or herbe grace / and as much Triacle / as a pease / and muste drinke vpon it water of Celendine / mixte with the water of whyte thystle / called in Latin / Cardu∣us Marie / or els water of Celendine alone two vnces. After the thyrd daye let him take of the foresayd pouder agayne / whether he be amended or not / and vse it foure dayes continuallye / and behaue him selfe in dietinge / as is sayd before: and it is to be hoped that he shall recouer / or els shall the agus turne to another kinde of feuer. ¶Of the Quartane / that is fourth dayes Feuer / which can scarsely be healed. THe dietinge and ordering in eating and drinkinge specified before / must be consydered / and then marke what tyme the colde shall co∣me: for the Quartane commeth not equaly / and vexeth a man som∣tyme more / somtyme lesse / and then doth it rest two dayes. When ye knowe the houre of the assaultinge / then take of thys drinke folowynge: Take Fenel a handfull / thre or foure leaues of Wormwod / seth these in half a pint of wyne vpon a soft fyre / tyll the thyrd part be sodden awaye. Then take it from the fyre / but let it remayne warme. And when a man percey∣ueth the assaultinge of the ague / then let him not reste / but ether walke / or cause him be led wyth the armes. In the forsayd wyne ought to be put half an vnce of hony of Roses / and then drinke a litle glasse full thereof / & walke and steare him selfe without ceasynge / so long he can / ye if nede is wyth the staye of other / so long tyll the colde minisheth. Then let him lye doune / and be well warme couered / that he do euen sweat / and slepe if he can / whiche he might happely do with werrinesse and faintnesse. When ye heate is gone then let him rise / and take meate if he listeth: if not / and that he thyrsteth / let him drinke of the forsayd water in the morning / and he shall amende / & get a stomake. Communely when men haue dronke the foresaid drinke / then haue they the ague more feruently then before: but let no man be afrayed therfore / nor desist / before he hath taken it fyue tymes. For he falleth to an amendement and lightening / saue the first daye / withoute he do misguide himselfe / as is sayd before. ¶A drinke for the Quartane. Take clensed Barly halfe a pounde / reed Chick peasen half an vnce / the herbe of Fenel and Mayden heyre / of eche a dram / ye leaues of Hertes toun∣ge / Rue and Wormwood of eche a dram / Licoris a quarter of an vnce or a drame: seth all these in a pottel of water / so longe / tyll a pint is soddē awaye. Then strayne that water through a cloth / and kepe it. Secondely put thre pintes of water to the forsayde thinges / and seth them tyll the Barlye waxe grosse / and then streyne it agayne. Thyrdly take agayne thre pintes of wa∣ter / and seth it agayne tyll the barly do burste / strayne it agayne as before: then putte all the waters together / and geue the paciente thereof to drinke when / or howe muche he will.
Item thre dayes oughte he to drinke euerye morninge a litle glasse full of the forsayd water / and a litle Triakle / ether with or without the water / as he can bes ake it. If that will not helpe the pacient / then take thys folowynge / and make him a drinke of it: Take the herbe of Fenel halfe a handfull / wormwod half so muche / seth them in stronge whyte wine / tyll the wyne be halfe sodden awaye. Then streyne it through a cloth / and put it into thesame so much ho¦nye of Roses as ye will. Of this wyne ought the pacient drinke a litle glasse full / before the ague commeth vpon him / and walke vpon it as long he can. After that let him lye doune and couer him warme / that he maye sweate. But he muste beware that he eate not foure or fyue houres before the sick∣nesse do ouertake hym. Auicenna in the fourth boke de cura Fabrium / sayeth generallye / that him that hath the ague comming of the gall / maye be ministred cold water:A com∣mun rule for agues cōminge of the gall. for it doth helpe to digest an consume the gall. But suche water ought to be ministred in due season / when he is in good temper / that is / nether to hote / nor to colde. Galen sayth that a dramme of Centory made to pouder / and taken with whyte wine thre mor¦ninges fasting / causeth good digestion. It is good also for costyffnesse and olde couges / as sayth Platea∣rius. The ende of the Homish Apotekary or Homely Physick.
