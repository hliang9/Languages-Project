The viij. is that thou vse saffron in thy mete / for it quy∣neth

Also wete well that vertue of defyynge is ofte brokyn when rawe mete is putte on halfe soden for the toon rawnes showueth out the other / and so the half sodyn is corupte: Moreouer that no man ete so moche that the stomak be heuy∣ed therwyth ne that his appetyte cease / But how that vsith grete exercyse & to moche and selde and therwyth eteth vnruly & contyeth it he shall dye by sodeyn, deth or shall fele wyc∣ked likenes. ye though his mete were ryghte
goode for by cause his dygestyon is corrupte therfore kepe well thi stomak from to moche mete & drynke / And it so myshap any tyme anoon wyth water & oyle or suche other spue it oute anon and then slepe / and yf thou maye not slepe walk softely vp & downe. and xxiiij. houres ete not after ne drynke not / then ete a lytill wyth a draught of good clene wyne. so the wyne be not to gret ne of hihe colour. and on the thyrday haue some exercyse and be ba∣thed / then ete a lytyll after / and after slepe & thou maye then vse this electuare dyatryon as sayth a fycysion. Two causes ben of sike¦nesses / that is dyuerse metes & long syttynge and moche etyng of dyuerse metes. for of hem ben gendred dyuers humours some goode & som euyll: long sittyng for then the mete that is fyrste take is defyed er the last begynne to defye, and so yt is defyed draweth wyth hym to the lyuer that is vndefyed / and so thise two ben cause of grete sikenesses: Also as old wy¦se men sayen man sholde neuer ete his fylle at one mele in takyng dyuerse metes / for as
a uycenne sayth no thynge is worse than to multyple metes and so to sytte long therat / for thi he sayth that men in olde tyme werē sa¦tysfyed at morow wyth bred alone and at e∣uyn wyth fleshe allone / And therwyth they sayden resonably the more mete shold betowar¦de euyn / but the costume were contrary / for a eyrēne seyth that hoole men sholde better ete at yenste nyght then no morow / for the kyndel is closed wythin them and gadreth about the bowelles.
