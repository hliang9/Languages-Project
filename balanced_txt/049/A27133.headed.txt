Pure ENCOURAGEMENTS FROM THE Spirit of the Lord, As a joyfull SALUTATION WITH FULL Assurance of Victory Unto the NOBLE ARMY Of the LAMB, Against whom the Gates of Hell and Death shall never prevail. Through a Vessel prepared to do his Will, whithersoever he leadeth it.
MY dear Friends, Brethren and Sisters, who are the called and chosen of God, out of the world, out of the nature, spirit, vanities and wayes of it, to follow the Lamb in the Regeneration, through the daily cross, the streight gait and narrow way, which leads to life; ye whose hearts breath and pant for the full enjoyment of the glorious liberty, which was with the Father before the world b gan, and are travelling with your faces towards the holy Hill of Sion, and cannot be satisfied with all the Treasures and glory of this present evil world, nor in any thing or creature, but only in the pure, eternal, refreshing presence of your God, in which are Rivers of pleasure, and joy for evermore. You who have cried to the Lord in the Land of Egypt, to go forth to sacrifice unto him in the wilderness; sensibly feeling, that while the precious Seed of his Covenant lay in death and the grave, it could not praise him; who hath perfectly known, that except the dead rise, all hearing, faith, and preaching to you was in vain, who were still in your sins and weighed down with corruptions, and overcome with divers temptations in that state. But now hath the Lord your God heard your cries and your groanings, and revealed his Arm of salvation, and brought you forth to the Light, and hath said to the prisoner of hope, shew thy self, and hath raised the Begger from the dunghil, and answered the tender cries of his innocent Babe, which could not live, nor be satisfied, without the sincere milk of the eternal Word of life; and ye have grown up from strength to strength, and have great experience of the loving kindness of your God (and of his many deliverances in the times of need, and of his wonders upon the Land of Egypt) which you have known to be as a cloud by day, and as a Pillar of Fire by night, and hath led you in a way you knew not, and in paths which you had not gone, and hath made himself known amongst you by his Name Jehovah, in which is everlasting strength. And now, O ye children of the true Israel of the God of Jacob, Is it your lot again to be driven by Pharaoh and his huge Host, to the Borders of the Red Sea? are the Mountains on each side, and the Egyptians behind you, pursuing with Horsmen and Chariots, to de∣stroy you from being a people and to root out the remembrance of your Name, and the Name of your God, from under Heaven: Why, this I proclame unto you all in the Name of my God and
your God, Stand still, stand still, and you shall see his mighty sal∣vation; for with a mighty hand and out-stretched arm will he de∣liver his chosen. Wherefore take no thought for your life, but free∣ly give up all into his hand, and cast all your care upon him, for not one hair of your head shall perish, beyond the permission of your heavenly Father, for ye are of more value unto him than many Birds of the Air, which cannot light on the earth without his Providence; and be not afraid of any amazement, O ye dear travelling children, the Lord of Hosts is your helper, who is in the midst of you, and his servant David a Prince among you: There∣fore fear not the Armies of the Aliens, Gg nor Mugog, with Gomor and his bands; the eternal God shall break and dash them in pieces like a Potters Vessel; he shall make them hear a noyse in the midst of their Camp, and their hearts shall tremble, the wind of a shaken leaf shall chase them: for the Lord is on our side, and he will plead the Cause of his Seed with all flesh; only obey you his voyce, and he will soon subdue your enemies, and your peace shall be as a River, and your rest shall be glorious. Oh sink down, sink down out of all thoughts, contrivings, or premeditations, and feel it, feel it, ye crying, travelling children, who have no helper in the earth, but the Lord your God alone, in whom is your everlasting strength. O ye Babes of uprightness, ye Sons and Daughters of Si∣on, comparable to fine gold, My soul is poured forth like water, before my God for you, that ye might be preserved and give up all to him as freely as he doth require it, in this day of tryal, and hour of temptation, that not an Ox or Sheep may be left behind to hin∣der you from enjoying the Kingdome, with any pretence whatso∣ever, remembring that obedience is more than Sacrifice: for the Lord loveth a cheerful giver, whose love you will feel to be strong∣er than death, which the many waters cannot quench, neither can the stoods drown it. Have not many of you this experience, as ye have faith∣fully followed the Lamb through your greatest Tribulations? and have ye not felt a washing your Robes white in his precious blood (the Life?) and have ye not learned a new Song, which he hath put in your mouths, after manifold Deliverances and Victories, which he hath wrought for you, even in the sight of the Heathen? Wherefore I say unto you, Lift up, lift up your Heads, ye Vali∣ants of Israel, the Lord of Hosts is with us, whose Arm is not short∣ned;
the Lamb is upon Mount Sion, with his hundred, forty and four thousands, gathering his numberless number from the four winds. Cast off all mortal thoughts, and the cares of this world, let not the Earth weigh you down, stand, stand upon the Watch-Tower, put on the whole Armour of God, give no place to the Devil, quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, within; then will ye not fear what man, or the sons of men, can do unto you: The God of Jacob is your Refuge, who will break the bow of the ungod∣ly, and snap their Spears asunder, and burn their Chariots in the fire, and make desolations in the earth; he is fulfilling his promises of old, made to his Chosen, who will give Nations for them, and and people for their life. I say, ye Worthies of the Lord, stand faithful, and be valiant for the truth upon the earth; for its against it they are fighting (within and without) that it might fall in the Streets, and be extinguished from the earth, and that equity and righteousness may not enter the Nations, who have said in their hearts, Come, let us kill the Heir, and the Inheritance will be ours: But in vain do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine such foolish things; for their hope shall perish, and their purposes be made void, they shall never bring to pass the thoughts of their hearts; the Lord hath spoken it, for the Seed of evil doers shall never be renowned. Wherefore, if ye hear of Wars, or Rumors, or Commotions, or Pestilences, or Famines, or the rushing of the ungodly, like the noyse of the raging Sea, which cannot rest, let not your heart be troubled, the Lord of Heaven and Earth (who is above all) will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, for your Redemption draweth nigh when ye see these things come to pass. And this is the word of the Eternal God unto all people upon the earth, the Redemption of his Seed draweth nigh, and hastneth to be delivered, as a woman in travel. Therefore ye Babes of God, ye Souldiers of the Lamb, put on Zeal as a Garment, and Righteousness as a Brest-plate, and be cloathed with Humility, and dwell in the Dread and Majesty of the Almighty, and let your hearts be fixed without wavering, look not back, remember Lots wife; for these are the days of vengeance, of tribulations, and distress of Nations, with great perplexi y, mens hearts failing them for fear looking at the things that are coming upon the earth: Now shall they see the Son of man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glory; now shall the
earthly Tribes mourn and wail becau of him whom they have pierced: But rejoyce, yea, sing, and rejoyce, ye children of the Bride Chamber, who are redeemed from the earth (and yet watch and pray continually) for the Lord will make your terrour (which is already begun) to fall upon all flesh, as the faithfull to him abide, and the fear of you, and the dread of you (O ye retired, meek, cir∣cumspect Babes) shall be upon every Beast of the field; and men in honour, not understanding (the Decree and Counsel of our God) are like the Beasts that perish, and perishing and withering shall be upon every hand that is stretched forth against his way and work in the earth; though they arise as the Locusts to compass the breadth thereof, the Lord of Heaven shall blast them, and they shall be∣come as dung upon the open field. Wherefore be ye not at all discouraged, neither be afraid of their faces, but gird on strength, and go on in the Name of the Lord. Is the Philistines Champion come forth to defie the Armies of the living God? doth he present himself fourty dayes, vaunting against his true Israel? doth he threaten to give your flesh to the Fowls of the Air, and to the Beasts of the field, to sell you for bond-men and bond-women? doth the hearts of any among your Tribes begin to faint at the hearing of his voyce? doth the height of his stature make you afraid? why, let no mans heart fail because of him; for behold, I see little David (your Prince) with the sling in his hand, and the smooth stone in the Shepherds bag, in the midst of you, running to meet him in the name and power of the Lord God of the Armies of Israel, whom he hath defied, who will smite the un∣circumcised in heart and ears, by the dread of his presence, which shall arise in the hearts of his Chosen, in the day of Battel; for he hath already delivered from the mouth of the Lion, and from the paw of the Bear, and he will also deliver us from this uncircumci∣sed Philistine, who shall be made like one of them. Therefore fear not, ye sons of Jacob, but be very couragious, be not at all dismayed at his high looks, nor daunted at his chaleng, but let us go on in the Name of the Lord our God, let us keep open Daniels Casement towards Jerusalem, as at other times, let us not regard any thing or Decree, contrary to the Worship of our God. Come ye Babes, lift up your heads in the pure strength of the Most High, for I feel Mo∣ses, Joshua, Daniel and David amongst you, and the spirits of all just
men from Abel to this day are stirring up to help you (blessed is the eye, that perfectly feeth these things) yea, the Lord of Hosts himself shall fight for you, and give you the victory, for the Battel is the Lords, its against Him and his Truth (which must spread over all the earth, as the waters cover the Sea) that the Potsherds have set themselves, who can dash and consume them in a moment, and will, when their work is done, and their time expired: where∣fore I say again, in the Name and dreadful Authority of my God, fear them not, the Day is yours, I see them all scattered as dust before the wind, that rise up against you, who have no helper in the earth, but from the Lord alone; ye called, chosen and saithful Ones, ye dear Lambs of my Father, gird on strength and valour; my soul rejoyceth in God, and my spirit doth magnifie him who is the Saviour of Israel, and my heart doth leap for joy, to see and feel your faithfulness unto death, and what this day will bring forth to his eternal glory, and renown of his Name, and the ever∣lasting comfort of you his people. The Lord will determine the Controversie, and make a short work in the earth. Now shall ye be as a City set on a Hill, that shall shine throughout the world: now shall the Arm of the Lord your God be revealed to the ends of the earth, in behalf of his precious Seed, which hath long suffer∣ed in hard bondage and sore captivity. And now many are the eyes that are fixed upon you, to see what will become of you in this day of tryal, who will have cause to glorifie and bless the Name of your God, through your faithful∣ness, courage, and boldness in the Truth, whereby many shall be drawn towards you, who will take hold of your skirts, and ac∣knowledge that the Lord of Heaven is with you; and a multitude shall be converted to him, and the desert shall be glad for him, and the wilderness shall rejoyce because of him, who is come to reign in Mount Sion, before his Ancients gloriously. Wherefore, ye dear Children, let this be your care and diligence to walk circumspectly towards them that are yet without, by keeping clear, walking with God in the pure still, retired life, in the inward parts, in which ye may see and judg every motion, and feel power to subdue and reign over all that is contrary. So dear Babes of God, dwell very still, cool, and calm in your minds, that ye may be preserved out of the forward, hasty spirit,
(which hath alwayes betrayed the innocent) and be kept back to the everlasting Foundation and Rock of the Generation of the righteous, whose dwelling place and refuge is the Name of the Lord in all Ages, who hid them in the hollow of his hand, and under the shadow of his wings, in the day of storms and raging Tempests of the wicked. So cast all your care upon him, for he careth for you, and his eye beholds you, which seeth in s cret, who is bringing his Seed through the fire and through the water, that all his people might be as fine Gold seven times tryed. And as for the wicked, your enemies and oppressors, look not at all at them or their power, their strength is a Reed of Egypt, their time and power is limited, but still look to the Lord, in whom is your help, in whose Name, and pure Dominion, and everlasting Authority, I give forth this Testimony unto you his people and children, that the day is at hand which shall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble, and the day that com∣eth shall burn them up, and shall leave them neither Root nor Branch, yea, the very Root of the wicked, as well as the Branch, will the Lord our God consume and destroy by the brightness of his arising. O happy day, blessed for ever, sing and rejoyce ye holy Prophets and Saints of the Most High, for the day of our Redemp∣tion approacheth, when all our burdens, oppressions, labour and travails shall cease; leap for joy, ye Babes in the womb of the Morning of this blessed day, at the sound of this Salvation, for its from your Father, the everlasting God, that liveth for ever, who hath said it, and will accomplish it, yea, the zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this. O ye dear Children, I say again, lift up your heads, watch, and be sober, Behold, the Bridegroom cometh be ready ye wise Virgins with your Lamps alway trim'd, and your Vessels full of oyl, that ye may behold his glorious ari∣sings, and see his wonders in the deep: For verily the day of our God is come as a Thief in the night, upon all the world of ungodly, who will not believe if one should rise from the dead, and declare it unto them, whose eyes the god of the world hath blinded, that they cannot perceive the Signs of the times, of which many are past already, and the last Sign is approaching, viz. And the Gospel of the Kingdome shall be preached for a witness unto all Nations and then shall the End come. And this am I to proclaim unto you his people, and to
the World let it be a Warning. And this is the Lord bringing to pass in a way unknown to the ungodly, and unexpected to the wicked, who are (and will be) doing wickedly, till it overtakes them as a flood; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand, and the righteous shall be glad and rejoyce in the God of their salvation. So these things arose in my heart by the Spirit of the Lord, to give forth unto you his chosen, that it might be as an instrument of encouragement to your precious Faith and Patience, against all opposition within and without, in this day of tryal and hour of temptation; for my soul is greatly refresht as with new wine, in the sence of what our God is hastning to bring forth, and of the portion of my cup I have freely let forth unto you his children, dearly saluting you with tender Bowels and pure Breathings and Desires, unto my God for you all, that we might all be kept staid, chast, single, innocent and valiant, in the strength of the enjoyment of his love, to serve and honour him in this our day and generati∣on, even while we have a Being; to whom my soul ascribeth all glory and thanks, in the living sence of his unspeakable mercies. Amen. The God of Love and Peace be with your spirit. Amen. From my Prison at Hartford the 20. of the 4. Month, 64. I am your Brother and Compa∣nion in the Tribulations, Kingdome and Patience of the Lamb. W. B. THE END.
