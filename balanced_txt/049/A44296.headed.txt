The HONOUR of Great YORK and ALBANY, A Loyal Song. To a Pleasant new Tune. The Commons now are at a stand, and evermore I hope shall be; For Scotland will be help at hand, for Great JAMES Duke of Al╌ba╌ny. For Scotland, 2. A braver Nation he can't have, For Love, for Truth, for Loyalty; Each man will Fight into his Grave, For great James Duke of Albany, Each man, &c. 3. A Souldier stout is he, and brave, As ever any Man did see, God bless the King, and Queen, and Save Our Great James, Duke of Albany, God bless, &c. 4. He very Wise, and Pious is, There's no Man knows the Contrary; Then Damn'd be him that thinks amiss, Of Great James Duke of Albany. Then Damn'd, &c. 5. All Loyal Subjects him must love, The Heir Apparent, still is he, Next to the King, there's none above Our Great James Duke of Albany. Next to the King, &c. 6. Then let our Reason our ill Will sway, And every Man upon his Knee, I do not mean to Drink but Pray, For Great James Duke of Albany. I do not mean, &c. 7. There's no man is so mad to think, That Drinking can availing be, 'Tis better for to Fight than Drink, For Great James Duke of Albany. 'Tis better, &c. 8. Yet do not think I'll bawk his Health, But with my Cup, most moderately, I'll drink, I'll fight, and spend my wealth, For Great James Duke of Albany. I'll Drink, I'll Fight, and spend, &c. Printed by Nath. Thompson at the entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden, near Charing-Cross, 1683.
