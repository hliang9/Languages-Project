PREFACE. READER. I HERE present you with a Small Treatise about Ringing; laying down such plain and easie Directions, as perhaps the like hath not been done before, both as to Plain Changes and Cross Peals, and other Matters necessary to be known, by those that would know how to Ring Round, or Under Sally &c. I have also in the Second Place endeavoured how to please such Persons as have a delight in Fireworks, imforming them how to make Ser∣pents, Fisgigs, Rockets, and other Fire∣works, as are commonly used on Days of Mirth and Rejoycing. AND in the Third Place, I have given Directions how to order Gardens; with an Account of the Tools or instruments necessary there∣in; wherein I have likewise laid down such Monthly Rules, which if observed will greatly improve you in that pleasant ART, and render you very expert therein. I have, Lastly, given Directions to make a Liquor which may be made and used as you do Tea, and which will be much cheaper, and more wholesome for English Bodies than those Foreign Liquors, &c. And I doubt not, but this Small Volume will give Satisfaction to those for whose sakes I have compiled it; which is the Desire of your Friend, J. WHITE
TINTINALOGIA. OR, THE ART of RINGING Improv'd. Shewing exact Rules for Ringing all Sorts of Plain Changes, and Cross Peals, with Directions for Pricking; also how to Hang Bells, with easie Direc∣tions for every Thing which necessarily belongs to that Art, by J. W. and other Members of that Society. TO avoid all Circumlocutions, he that intends to enter himself into a Com∣pany, must in the first be able to set a Bell fore-stroak, and back stroak; in the next place, he must know how to ring Round, or under Sally; neither must he be ignorant in the tuning of the Bell; for the attain∣ing of which, let him learn on Wire Bells, that he may know a Third, Fifth, and Eighth, which are the Principal Concords; or a Pitch Pipe made by an Organist may serve as well, containing eight Notes, or more, with their sharps, and flats, very useful in the Tuning of Bells.
Take this as a general Rule, begin at the Ten∣nor or biggest Bell, and count three whole Notes, then an half Note or Sharp; three whole Notes, then an half Note, or Sharp, and so on till you come to the least Bell or Treble▪ For Example, on four Bells, 1▪234, here the 432, are whole Notes, and the half note, or sharp, is between the 1 and 2▪ On five Bells, 12:345, the 543, are whole notes, and the half note and sharp is between 2 and 3. On six Bells, 123:456, the half note or sharp is between 3, and 4. On eight Bells, 1:2345:678, one half note or sharp, is between 5 and 6, and the other between 1 and 2. On ten Bells, 123:4567:8910, here one half note is be∣tween 7 and 8, and the next between 3, and 4. On twelve Bells, 12:345:6789:10, 11, 12. here one half note, or sharp is between 9, and 10. the next between 5, and 6, and the other between 2, and 3, which last is made contrary to the former Rule, it being but two whole notes, from the next half note to it; the reason is this, the Ninth is one whole note below the Eighth, therefore the 2 must be a whole note below the Treble, otherwise they would not be a true Eighth, therefore the half note is put between 2 and 3 With these Rules are re∣quired good Ears, to judge of the Concords, and then you will easily know whether the Bells be in Tune or not. Of the Changes. A Change between two Bells that strike next to to each other, is no more than removing into each others place, as 1, 2. the Change 2, 1. and so into their proper places again 1, 2. On three Bells there are six several Changes, in Ringing of which you must observe a Bell called the Hunt, the other two are called the extream Bells, but improperly, because every Bell Hunts in
the six Changes. The Name of Hunt is properly given to it, because of its continual Motion up and down amongst the other Bells: The other two Bells are called extreams; because when the Hunt is either before or behind them, there is a Change to be made then between them, called an extream Change. There are two several Ways to Ring the six Changes; the first by making the Treble Hunt, and the other the Tennor, supposing the Bells to stand thus, 123, you must Hunt the Treble thus; Hunt the Treble over the Second, and Third, ma∣king a Change between the Treble on each of those two Bells in order; therefore first you must remove the Treble up over the Second, into the Seconds place, by making a Change between the Second and Treble thus, 213. The Treble being removed up over the Second, it must next be removed up over the Third thus, 231. Here note that when the Hunt moves from the foremost Bell towards the hindmost, then it Hunts up, as in the Changes afore specified; but when it moves from the hindmost Bell, towards the Bell that leads, then it Hunts down as by the following Changes. The Treble being Hunted up behind the extream Bells, an extream Change is next to be made between them, 321. The extream Change being made, the Treble must be Hunted down again before the Bells in this manner, 312—132. The Treble being now Hunted down, the next is to be an extream Change, 123. the last Change of the Six. The other way of Ringing the Six Changes, is by making the Tennor the Hunt, which being be∣hind already, it must first be Hunted down, as in these Changes, 123—132—312. The Third, which is the Hunt, being Hunted down before the Bells, the extream Change must next be made be∣tween the 2 and 1. which are the extream Bells
thus—321. The extream Change being made, the Third must be Hunted up again 231. The Third being Hunted up, another extream Change must be made which brings the Bells round in their right places again—123. Now on Four Bells, there are Four and twenty Changes, in Ringing of which, there is one Bell called the Hunt, and the other three extream Bells; it never lies but once in a place, except when it comes before or behind the Bells, at which time it ies there twice together, it has the same course as in the Six Changes aforesaid, two of the extream Bells make a Change every time the Hunt comes before or behind them. These Four Figures 1234, representing the Four Bells, the Treble must be Hunted up behind the Bells thus, 2134 2314 2341 The next is to be an extream Change between the two farthest Extream Bells, from the Hunt, which are the Second and Third 3241 3214 3124 1324 The Treble being Hunted down, an Extream Change between the second and fourth. 1342 3142 3412 3421 4321 The Extream being made Hunt, the Treble as before making an Extream Change, every time Hunt comes before or behind the Bells. 4312 4132 1432 1423 4123 4213 4231 2421 2431 2413 2143 1243 1234
The Twenty four Changes are to be Rung another way in Hunting up the Treble, which is by ma∣king every Extream Change between the two near∣est Bells to the Hunt, as in these Changes; first I Hunt the Treble up thus — 1234 2134 2314 2341 These two ways of Ringing the Twenty four differ only in making the Extream Changes; the one must be between the two farthest Extream Bells from the Hunt, and the other between the two nearest to it. As you Hunt the Treble, so you must the Second, Third, and Fourth. The way of Hunting the Third up, and making the Ex∣tream Change between the two farthest Bells from it, is thus, First Hunt up the Third over the Fourth; the Hunt being up, I make an Extream between the Treble, and the Second, and then Hunt down the Third again, and so to the end of the Peal after this manner. 1234 1243 2143 2134 2314 3214 The Twenty four plain Changes are to be Rung Sixteen several ways, for in Hunting one Bell it is to be Rung four ways, that is, two in Hunting it up, and two in Hunting it down, so that Four Bells make four times four, which is sixteen; some of which I have here set down.
Treble Hunt up Extream between the two farthest Bells from it. Second up, Extream be∣tween the two nearest to it. Fourth down Extream be∣tween the two farthest Bells from it. 1234 2134 2314 2341 3241 3214 3142 1324 1342 3412 3421 4321 4312 4132 1432 1423 4123 4213 4231 2431 2413 2143 1243 1234 1234 1324 1342 1342 1432 1423 1243 2143 2413 4213 4123 4132 4312 4321 4231 2431 2341 3241 3421 3412 3142 3124 3214 2314 2134 1234 1234 1243 1423 4123 4132 1432 1341 1324 3124 3142 3412 4312 4321 3421 3241 3214 2314 2341 2431 4231 4213 2413 2143 2134 1234 In the Twenty four Changes, are contained the Six Changes, the three Extream Bells in the twen∣ty four make the six Changes in course, every Ex∣tream Change being one of the six, and the Hunt Hunting through each of the six Changes, make twenty four. For Example, take the three Ex∣tream Bells in the first twenty four set down be∣fore, which are 234 and set down on them the six Changes thus — 234 324 342 432 423 243 Now take the first Change, which is 234, set the Treble before it, and Hunt it through thus — 1234 2134 2314 The Treble being Hunted up behind take the next Change of the six which
is 3:4, set it directly under the first 2341 234 and Hunt the Treble down through it thus— 3241 3214 3124 1324 And so take each of the other six Changes, and Hunt the Treble through them, it will make twenty four. On Five Bells there are Sixscore Changes to be Rung by observing a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, and three Extream Bells, the course of the whole Hunt is the same with the Hunt in the twenty four Changes, and Hunt up and down in the same manner. The half Hunts moves once, that is over one Bell every time the whole Hunt comes before and behind the Bells, but when the half Hunt is removed either before or behind the Extream Bells, then there is an Extream Change to be made. For Example, I make the Treble the whole Hunt, and Hunt it up: the Second, the half Hunt, and half Hunt it up, making every Ex∣tream Change between the two farthest Etam Bells from the half Hunt; the Extream Bells  the Third, Fourth, and Fifth. Now observe, whereas in the twenty four Changes, an Extream Change was always made, when the whole Hunt came before or behind the Bells, in these Sixscore Changes, an Extream is always to be made when the half Hunt comes before or behind the Extream Bells: First, the Treble is to be Hunted up as in these Changes — 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 The whole Hunt being Hunted up, the Se∣cond which is the half Hunt, must be Hunted up over one Bell, as in this Change — 32451. The half Hunt be∣ing removed up over one Bell, the whole Hunt must be Hunted down again, as in these Chan∣ges— 32415 32145 31245 13245 The whole Hunt being Hunted down, the half Hunt is to be removed up over the Fourth, which is the next Bell to
it — 13425. The whole Hunt is to Hunt up as before—31425. Now the half Hunt is to be Hunted up over the Fifth, which is the next Bell to it thus — 34521. Here the Second, which is the half Hunt, is removed quite up behind the Extream Bells: Yet the Extream Change is not to be made, until the whole Hunt hath removed down through the Bells, as in these Changes — 34512 34152 31452 13452 Take this for a certain Rule, that whenso∣ever the half Hunt has removed up behind the Extream Bells, or down before them, the whole Hunt must Hunt through the Bells, be∣fore the Extream Change is made, as in the last Change but four which is 3, 4, 5.2, 1. The Se∣cond being the half Hunt, is removed up behind the 3, 4, and 5, which are the Extream Bells; and then the whole Hunt being behind, Hunts immediately down, and now the Extream Change is to be made between the 3, and 4, which are the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt thus, 143 2. The Extream being made the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to remove again, but first the whole Hunt must be Hunted up after this manner — 41352 43152 43512 43521 43251 The half Hunt being removed the whole Hunt must be Hunted down thus— 43215 43125 41325 14325 14235 Now Hunt up the Tre∣ble.— 41235 42135 42315 42351 24351 After this Hunt down the Second before the Extream Bells, then Hunt down the Treble again, and make the Extream Change as in these Changes — 24315 24135 21435 12345 12453 The last is the Extream Change which is made between the Third and Fifth, and this course is to be observed to the end of the Sixscore Changes.
According to the Terms of Art belonging to Ringing, when the Second is down, and the Fourth up it is to be noted that the first Bell named is the whole Hunt, and the next named is the half Hunt; the second Bell down, is that Bell which is the whole Hunt, and hunts down the first Change; the Fourth Bell is the half Hunt, and to half Hunt up, that is to move up towards the hindmost Bell the first time it moves at the begin∣ning of the Peal, which are only Directions in ma∣king the first Changes; for one whole Hunt and half Hunt, may be hunted several ways, either up or down at pleasure▪ If you hunt down the Second, it is thus, 12345 — 21345. The Second being hunted down, the Fouth which is the half Hunt must be removed up over the Bell thus—21354 The half Hunt being removed, The Second must be hunted up, for Exam∣ple — 12354 13254 13524 13542 31542 31524 31524 31254 32154 32154 23154 23145 Observe then that the Fourth, which is the half Hunt, being behind the Extream Bells, the next is to be an Extream Change, which may be made either between the two farthest Bells from the half Hunt, or the two nearest to it; and after the Extream Change is made, the whole Hunt and half Hunt must be hunted as before. In every Sixscore the Extream Changes may be made either between the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, or between the two nearest to it, observing to make all the Extreams in one Sixscore alike; for Instance, if you make the first Extream Change between the two sarthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt, you must make
all the following Extreams in the same Sixscore be∣tween the two farthest Extream Bells also; or if you make the first Extream in any Sixscore between the two nearest to the half Hunt, you must make all the following Extreams in the same Sixscore, be¦tween the two nearest also. The Sixscore plain and single Changes are to be rung Eightscore several ways; for although there are but Sixscore several Changes on five Bells; yet by altering the whole Hunt, the half Hunt and Extreams, the courses of the Changes are so altered, that the same Changes do not come all along alto∣gether in any two of these Eightscore ways. The Eightscore Changes are to be rung eight se∣veral ways with one whole Hunt and half Hunt. The first is by hunting the whole Hunt and half Hunt both up; the Second is by hunting them both down; the Third is by hunting the whole Hunt up, and the half Hunt down; the Fourth is by hunting the whole Hunt down, and the half Hunt up, and each of these are to be rung two other se∣veral ways: The First is by making the Extream between the two farthest Extreams from the half Hunt; and the Second is by making them between the two nearest; that is, make the Treble the whole Hunt, and the Second the half Hunt. Now to ring the Sixscore Changes eight several ways is thus. First, observe that your Extream Changes be made between the two farthest Extreams from the half Hunt, and then let Treble and Second be both up, Treble and Second both down: Treble down and Second up: Treble up and Second down. In the next place, let the Extream Changes be made between the two nearest Extreams to the half Hunt, which is called Mediums, and then let Tre∣ble and Second be both up; Treble and Second both down; Treble down, and the Second up; Treble up, and Second down.
On Five Bells there are twenty Hunts, in shert it is thus: A whole Hunt and a half Hunt twenty times, and not one and the same Hunt whole, or half Hunt twice, as appears by these following Fi∣gures standing by two's, one of which is the whole Hunt, and the oher the half Hunt— 1. 2 1. 3 1. 4 1. 5 2. 1 2. 3 2. 4 2. 5 3. 1 3. 2 3. 4 3. 5 4. 1 4. 2 4. 3 4. 5 5. 1 5. 2 5. 3 5. 4 So that here being twenty Hunts, and every one making eight Sixscore, as in the Example of Treble and Second, that is twenty, which are the Number of Hunts multiplyed by Eight, which are the Num∣ber of Sixscores, made by each Hunt, does produce Eightscore several ways of Ringing Sixscore Changes. In the Sixscore Changes are comprehended the Twenty four, with the Six Changes. The Twenty four Chan∣ges are made between the half Hunt and the three Extream Bells, and the Six are made between the Extream Bells alone. The half Hunt in the Sixscore, is the whole Hunt in the Twenty four; and there is one Change in the Twenty four made every time the whole Hunt comes before or be∣hind the Bells, and one Change in the Six made every Extream, so that the Sixscore rightly understood, is nothing else but hunting the half Hunt through every Change of the Six and then hunting the whole Hunt through every Change of the Twenty four which makes Sixscore. In every Sixscore on Five Bells, are Six Extream Chan∣ges, there being twenty Changes from one Extream to another; as for Instance, take these few Changes following, but with this Observation, That there is a Lne drawn between the Figures, just twenty Changes from the beginning of the Peal, and the Changes next following each Line is the Extream.
Treble and Second both up, Extream between the two farthest Extream Bells from the half Hunt. 12345 21345 23145 23415 23451 32451 32415 32145 31245 13245 13425 31425 34125 34215 34251 34521 34512 34152 31452 14352 — 14242 41352 43152 43512 43521 43251 43215 43125 41325 14325 14235 41235 42135 42315 42351 24351 24315 24135 21453 12453 — 12435 21435 24153 24513 24531 42531 42513 42153 41253 14253 14523 41523 45123 45213 45231 45321 45312 45132 41532 14532 — 15432 51432 54132 54312 54321 54231 54213 54123 51423 15423 15243 51243 52143 52413 52431 25431 25413 25143 21543 12543 — 12534 21534 25134 25314 25341 52341 52314 52134 51234 15234 15324 51324 53124 53214 53241 53421 53142 53142 51342 15342 — 13542 31542 35142 35412 35421 35241 35214 35124 31524 13524 13254 31254 32154 32514 32541 23541 23514 23154 21354 12354 — 12345

The Changes on Six Bells. NOW let us come to the Changes on Six Bels, which are found by Ringing Artists, to be Seven hundred and twenty; and there are Peals of Sixscore, and Twelvescore Changes to be Rung on them. The Sixscore Changes are to be Rung by observing a whole Hunt, and half Hunt; which you must hunt after the same man∣ner as you hunt the Sixscore Changes on Five Bells, and the Extream Changes to be made by the same Rules as is afore exprest. Only there is this Difference between the Sixscore Changes on Six Bells, and the Sixscore on Five; for note, that on Five Bells there are but three Extreams, but on Six Bells there are four Extreams: Again on Five Bells, there are Six extream Changes in every Sixscore; but on Six there are but four ex∣tream Changes: Further observe, That whereas on Five Bells in every Sixscore, the Changes are the same in each, though altered in course; the Changes on Six Bells, are not the same in each: For several Sixscores, have several Changes, one Sixscore having many Changes, which another Sixscore hath not, as in this following Peal Tre∣ble and Second both up, which is, 123456. The Example is demonstrated in the next Page.

On six Bells may be Rung other Peals as Six∣scores on the five smallest, the Tenor bying behind all the way. Treble and Second, or Treble and Fifth, with the Tenor lying behind ravisheth the Ears of all Lovers of the Art of Ringing. The Seven hundred and twenty Changes is the next thing I shall insist upon, omitting to speak of the Twelvescore Changes, since they are compre∣hended in the Seven hundred and twenty. Now in Ringing the Seven hundred and twenty, there is a whole Hunt, a half Hunt, a quarter Hunt, and three extream Bells. The half Hunt removes over one Bell, and when the half Hunt is removed be∣fore or behind the quarter Hunt, and extream Bells, (at which time in a Sixscore the Extream is made) then the quarter Hunt removes over one Bell, in the same course as the half Hunt moves, when the whole Hunt is before or behind. As for Example, 1, 2, and 3 all up. i. e. Treble the whole Hunt, and to hunt up, Second the half Hunt, and to half Hunt up, and Third the quarter Hunt, and to quarter Hunt up: 4, 5, and 6, are extream Bells. There is always an extream Cange to be made when the quarter Hunt comes before, or behind the extream Bells: There are two ways of making the Extreams, which are the same here, as in the Six∣score on five Bells, and made by the same Rule. Now the Treble and Second being the whole and half Hunt, they must be hunted in the same course, as in the Sixscore on five Bells after this manner. 123456 213456 231456 234156 234516 234561 324561 324516 324156 321456 312456 132456 134256 314256 341256 342156 342516 342561 345261 345216 345126 341526 314526 134526 134562 314562 41562 345162 345612 345621
The half Hunt being hunted up, the Third is to remove over one Bell, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt to romove again thus, 435621 435612 435162 431562 413562 143562 143526 413526 431526 435126 435216 435261 432561 432516 432156 431256 413256 143256 142356 412356 421356 423156 423516 423561 243561 243516 243156 241356 214356 124256 The whole Hunt and half Hunt being hunted down, the quarter Hunt must remove up over the Fifth, and then the whole Hunt, and half Hunt must hunt up again in this manner. 124536 214536 241536 245136 245316 245361 425361 425316 425136 421536 412536 142536 145236 415236 451236 452136 452316 452361 453261 453216 453126 351426 415326 145326 145362 415362 451362 453162 453612 453621
The whole Hunt and half Hunt being hunted up, up, the quarter Hunt must be removed quite up over the sixth thus, 456321, the quarter Hunt being hunted up behind the extream Bells; yet you must not make the extream Change until the whole Hunt, and half Hunt, have both removed through the Bells, for Example. 456312 456132 451632 415632 145632 145623 415623 451623 456123 456213 456231 452631 452613 452163 415263 451263 145263 142563 412563 421563 425163 425613 425631 245631 245613 245163 241563 214563 124563 From these last Changes this certain and con∣stant Rule is to be observed, That when the quarter Hunt removes either quite up, behind the extream Bells, or down before them; the whole Hunt and half Hunt, must hunt through the Bells before the extream Change is to be made. The extream Change is now to be made be∣tween the Fourth and Fifth, being the two farthest extream Bells from the Third, which is the quarter Hunt thus, 125463.
The Extream being made, the whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, must be hunted as be∣fore; and first, the whole Hunt, and half Hunt are to be hunted up, as in these Changes. 215463 251463 254163 254613 254631 524631 524613 524163 521463 512463 152463 154263 514263 541263 542163 542613 542631 546231 546213 546123 541623 514623 154623 154632 514632 541632 546132 546312 546321 The whole Hunt, and half Hunt, being hunted up, the quarter Hunt must hunt down under the Sixth, which is the next Bell unto it; and then the whole Hunt, and half Hunt, must hunt down again, as in these Changes. 543621 543612 543162 541362 514362 154362 154326 514326 541326 543126 543216 543261 542361 542316 542136 541236 514236 154236 152436 512436 521436 524136 524316 524361 254361 254316 254136 251436 215436 25436
The quarter Hunt must be hunted down under the Fourth, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt are to be hunted up again; for Example, thus, 125346 215346 251346 253146 253416 253461 523461 523416 523146 521346 512346 152346 153216 513246 531246 532146 532416 532461 534261 534216 534126 531426 513426 153426 153462 513462 531462 534162 534612 534621 Now the quarter Hunt is to be hunted down before the extream Bells, and then the whole Hunt and half Hunt, hunt again before the extream Change is made, after this manner. 354621 354612 354162 351462 315462 135462 135426 315426 351426 354126 354216 354261 352461 352416 352146 351246 315246 135246 132546 312546 321546 325146 325416 325461 235461 235416 235146 231546 213546 123546 Here you see the Twelvescore Changes are plain∣ly set down, and now it lies at the Ringers pleasure either to bring the Bells round, and so end the Twelvescore; or else to proceed 'till they have fi∣nish'd the Seven hundred and twenty. If the Bells are not brought round at the Twelvescore, they cannot come round, untill the Seven hundred and twenty Changes are performed, and then they
come round in course. To bring the Bells round at the end of these Twelvescore Changes, the Ex∣tream is made between the Five and Four, which were the two Bells which made the last extream Change, and brings them round in their right pla∣ces again, as you may see by these following Fi∣gures, 123456. There are but two Extream Changes in every Twelvescore, wherein it is con∣stantly observed, that the last Extream Change is to be made between those two Bells which made the first Extream, otherwise the Bells would not come round at the end of the Twelvescore. Here note, that the Twelvescore Changes are but an imperfect Peal, being but a third part of the Changes which are to be Rung on six Bells, and therefore not to be brought round, unless the last extream Change is made out of course. In every Seven hundred and twenty, there are six extream Changes, there being Sixscore Chan∣ges between each. The Twelvescore Changes are to be Rung with any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, observing to make the last extream Change, between those two Bells which made the first. The Seven hundred and twenty plain Changes are to be Rung One thousand four hundred and forty several ways, by altering the whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt and Extream Bells: For Demonstration sake. On six Bells there are One hundred and twenty several Hunts; that is to say, a whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt. Six∣score several times, and not one and the same whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt twice, as you may see by these Figures—123.
123 124 125 126 132 134 135 136 142 143 145 146 152 163 154 156 162 163 164 165 213 214 215 26 231 234 235 236 241 243 245 246 251 253 254 256 261 263 264 265 312 314 315 316 321 324 325 326 341 342 345 346 351 352 354 356 361 362 364 365 412 413 415 416 421 423 425 426 431 432 435 436 451 452 453 456 461 462 463 465 512 513 514 516 521 523 524 526 531 532 534 536 541 542 543 546 561 562 563 564 612 613 614 615 621 623 624 625 631 632 635 641 642 643 645 651 652 653 654 Each three of these Figures represent the three Hunts; the first Figure stands for the whole, the second, for the half, and the third, for the quarter Hunt. With whole, half, and quarter Hunt, the Seven hundred and twenty Changes are to be Rung, or set down twelve several ways; for Example, take the first three Hants, in these Figures, 123. where the Treble is the whole Hunt, the second, the half Hunt, and the third, the quarter Hunt, which may be hunted as I said before, six several ways in this manner: Treble, Second, and Third, all up — Treble and Second up, Third down — Treble up, Second and Third down — Threble, Second and Third, all down — Treble and Se∣cond down, Third up — Treble down, Second and Third up.
Each of these are to be rung two ways: One is to make the Extreams between the two farthest, extream Bells from the quarter Hunt; the second way is to make the Extream between the two next Bells to the quarter Hunt. By Treble, Second, and Third all up, is meant that the Treble is the whole Hunt, and to hunt up the first Change at the beginning of the Peal; the Second is the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bells the first time it moves at the beginning of the Peal; the Second, is the half Hunt, and to half hunt up, that is, to move up towards the hindmost Bells, the first time it moves at the beginning of the Peal; and the Third, is the quarter Hunt, to move like∣wise towards the hindmost Bells, the first times it removes. By Treble and Second up, and Third down, is meant, that the Treble and Second are to move up towards the hindmost Bell, the first time each re∣moveth at the beginning of the Peal; and the Third being the quarter Hunt, is to move down the first time, which are only Directions of moving the Hunts at first, because they may be hunted ei∣ther up or down. Take this as a general Rule for hunting any whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, so as to produce six several ways to ring the Seven hun∣dred and twenty Changes. Whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt, all hunted up. Whole Hunt and half Hunt, hunted up, and quarter Hunt down. Whole Hunt, hunt∣ed up, half Hunt and quarter Hunt down. Whole Hunt, and quarter Hunt down. Whole Hunt, and half Hunt hunted down, and quarter Hunt up; whole Hunt, hunted down, half hunt, half hunt and quarter Hunt, hunted up.
Now each of these six Ways, may be Rung two other ways by altering the Extream Changes that is to say, the first way is to be done by making the Extream Changes betwixt the next two Extream Bells to the quarter Hunt; and the other way is to make the Extreams between the two farthest Ex∣tream Bells from it. The Seven Hundred and Twenty Changes are to be Rung twelve ways with one whole Hunt, half Hunt, and quarter Hunt; so that with the Sixscore Hunts, it is to be Rung Sixscore Times Twelve Ways, which make One thousand four hundred and forty several ways in Ringing the Seven hundred and twenty Changes In the Seven hundred and twenty plain Changes, the half Hunt, the quarter Hunt, and the three Ex∣tream Bells, make the Sixscore Changes on five Bells. The twenty four Changes on four Bells, and the six Changes on three Bells, have also a perfect course in the Seven hundred and twenty, in the same manner as they had in the Sixscore on five Bells. There is always one Change in the Sixscore made every Time the whole Hunt comes before or behind the Bells, which is every sixth Change; and there is one Change of the twenty four made every time the whole Hunt and half Hunt comes, before or behind the Bells, which is once in thirty Changes, and one Change of the six, made every Extream, that is once in Sixscore Changes You may take the Sixscore Changes on five Bells, Treble the whole, and Second, the half Hunt as aforesaid; and hunt the Second Bell through every Change of the Sixscore which will make the Seven hundred and twenty Changes, Tenor the whole Hunt, Treble the half Hunt, and Second, the quar∣ter Hunt.
Necessary Instructions for all who desire to Ring the Changes well. THEY who Ring the Extream Bells in the Twenty Four Changes, must be careful in minding the Motion of the Hunt, that they may the better know when to make the Extream Changes. In a sixscore on five Bells, he that Rings the half Hunt, must observe the Motion of the whole Hunt; and they who Ring the Extream Bells, must ob∣sorve the Motions both of the whole Hunt, and the half Hunt, that they may know when the half Hunt is to move, and also when to make the Ex∣treme Changes. The whole Hunt is the easiest Bell to Ring in any Changes, and the half Hunt is not so hard and dif∣licult to Ring as an Extreme Bell. All Changes are to be Rung either by walking the Bells, or else by whole Pulls, or half Pulls. By that Ringing them of Walking the Bells, is meant the ounding of them four, six, eight times, or more in one Change; a thing commonly practised by young Beginners Whole Pulls is to Ring two rounds in one Change, that is fore-stroke, and back-stroke in a Change; so that every time you pull down the Bells at Sally, you make a new Change, differing from that at the back stroke next before. These whole Pulls were altogether, used in former Times: But of late, there is a more quick and ready way found out called half Pulls, which is only once round in a Change,
that is, one Change made at the fore-stroke, and another at the back-stroke. In Ringing half Pulls, some Peals do cut compass, that is the whole Hunt comes to lead at the back, stroke, to remedy which, make the first Change of the Peal at the back-stroke. By these following Rules you may know what Peals cut compass, and what do not, (viz.) of plain and single Changes. On Six Bells. IN hunting either the Treble, the Third, or the Fifth down, cuts compass, but hunting them up, does not. In hunting the Second, Fourth, or Sixth up, cuts compass, but hunting them down does not These Rules, leaving out the Tennor, serve for five Bells, and leaving out the Fifth and Tennor, they serve for four Bells. The Variety of Changes on any number of Bells. THE Changes do multiply infinitely, accord∣ing to the Number of the Bells. On two Bells, there are two Changes. On three Bells, three times as many Changes as there are on two. Four, four times as many as three; and so on in like man∣ner to twelve Bells, as you may see by this Table of Figures representing the Bells, and the Changes answering those Bells in the Column to it, thus—
Bells. Changes. 2— 2 3— 6 4— 24 5— 120 6— 720 7— 5040 8— 40320 9— 362880 10— 3628800 11— 39916800 12— 479001600 The lowest Figure belonging to twelve Bells, amounts to Four Hundred and Seventy Nine Milli∣ons One Thousand Six Hundred Changes, that can be made on Twelve Bells. Now supposing that Twelve Men should undertake to Ring the Changes on Twelve Bells, they would be Seventy▪Five Years, Ten Months, one Week, and three Days in Ringing them all over, according to the proportion of Time, in Ringing Seven Hundred and Twenty Changes in the space of one whole Hour, reckon∣ing Twenty Four Hours to the Day, and Three Hundred Sixty Five Days in the Year. Now though on Eight Bells there are 40320 Changes, yet the greatest Peal that ever was Rung upon them, was 1680, being only a third Part of the Changes on Seven Bells, which are to be Rung with a whole Hunt, half Hunt, quarter Hunt, half quarter Hunt, and three Extreme Bells: But the most musical Peal that ever was Rung on Eight Bells, is Grandsir Bob, Treble. Second, and ifth, half pulls on 123567, the Fourth, and the Tennor lying
behind every Change thus, 123567, 48, which has of late been much practised by the College-Youths. Tendring Sixscore on Eight Bells, makes excel∣lent Harmony, 748 lying behind every Change, and a Sixscore (four Extreams) on the Six Bells, in the midst, the Treble leading all the Way, and the Tennor lying behind, making a Change at first between the Four and Five, and then proceeds for∣ward in the Sixscore, making the Second the whole Hunt, and the Seventh the half Hunt; after the Sixscore Changes are made, the Fourth, and Fifth must change their Places again to bring the Bells round. Having given you these short yet easie Directions for all sorts of plain and single Changes, I should proceed to cross Peals, as Doubles and Singles on Four Bells, the Twelvescore Long Hunts, or the Esquires Twelvescore; Doubles and Singles on Five ells; Tendrings Sixscore on Five Bells; Paradox on Five Bells; Phoenix on Five Bells; London Plea∣sure on Five Bells; what you please, Doubles and Singles on Five Bells; New Doubles, Old Doubles, Grandsire Bob, and several other Peals, which will take me up too much Time, wherefore I shall refer the Reader to his own and others Practice, for his further Information. A word or two concerning Hanging of Bells, and I shall conclude. Having got your Stock in readiness, mark then whether the Cannons or Crown of the Bell be up∣right and true, then raise the Bell up tied by some Rope to the Cannons in such Sort, that the Bell may hang level, which you may find by applying a Plummet to the brim, then fasten a string to the Crown staple within the Bell, then a Plummet being tied to the other end of the string, if the string hang in the midst between the two sides of the Bell whereon the Clapper should strike, the Crown staple is cast into the Bell true. The Bell being
hung, and the Gudgeons let in true by Keys, then if the Clapper hang in the midst between the two striking sides, and the Stock stand upright, the Bell is well hung. Here note, that the trussing, or taking up of a Bell far into the Stock by a notch, makes the Bell go easier, and lie lighter when it is set. As for the tempering of the Gudgeons, I leave to the Founder, and shall only speak of their polish∣ing. After they are filed, or turned exactly round, take two pieces of Oak, and oyl each side of them, and strew fine Sand thereon, theu clap them in a Smith's Vice, with the round of the Gudgeons be∣tween, then turn it about until you think it is sufficiently polished, then all the sides of the Oak which had no Sand on them, and do as before, that will make them very smooth for your purpose; polish your Brasses well too, for the roughness of both, or either, will hinder the Bell from going smooth and steddy. It is very requisite to hang Bells with bolts of Iron, to come from the Cannons through the Stock, and to fasten them with Keys on the top of the Stock, and not with Plates nailed on the sides, for they are very convenient to fasten a Bell that is loose in the Stocks, or to alter the stroke if required. As for the Rowl let it not be without nor within the hollow of the side of the Wheel, nor above nor below the hollow at the bot∣tom of the Wheel. Now the bigger the Wheel is, if the Frame will permit, the Bell will go the better; when the Wheel is new, nail Stays from the Stock to each Post, to keep it from Warping.
For the better observing the Ringing of Changes or Rounds, these three Things are to be Noted. 1. THE Raising true in Peal. 2 Ringing at a low Compass; and 3. Ceasing in Peal: All which Three are the most essential Parts to render a Practitioner Excellent 1. For Raising a Peal of Bells true, the modern and best Practice recommends the swiftest and quickest possible, every one taking Assistance to raise his Bell, as its going requires; the lesser Bells as Treble, &c. being by main Strength held down in thier first Sway (or pull) to get time for the striking of the rest of larger Compass; and so continued to be strong pulled till Frame-high, and then may be slackned: The bigger, as Tenor, &c must be pincht or checkt over head, that the Notes may be heard to strike roundly and handsomely. Ob∣serve that all the Notes strike round at one Pull: I do not mean the first; but 'tis according to the Bigness and Weightiness of your Bells: However, in rasing a Peal, do not let one Bell strike before the rest, or miss when the rest do; this is contrary to the strict Rules of true Ringing: And this is called Round-ringing. Now, if you design to raise a Peal of Bells for Changes, you ought to raise them to a Set pull, as the most proper for command∣ing the Notes, and he who is not well skilled to
manage his Bell at a set pull, will be apt to drop, or over-turn it, be in a Wood, and fruitlesly toil and moil himself. Therefore in practising the Set∣ting of a Bell, dast your Eye about the other Bell-Ropes, during your managing your own, that you may accustom your self to manage it according to the Change. 2. For Ringing at a low Compass, is thus obser∣ved: By keeping a due punctum, or beat of Time, in the successive striking one after another of every Bell; the best Ringer being set to the Treble, that may guide and direct the rest of the Notes in their due Measure. 3. For ceasing a Peal of Bells; let them fall gra∣ally from a set Peal, checking them only at Sally, 'till the low Compass renders it useless; and when so low, that for want of Compass, they can scarce strike at Back stroke; then let the Trebele Ringer stamp as a Signal, to notify, that the next Time they come to strike at the Fore-stroke, to check them down, to hinder their striking the Back-stroke; yet Fore-stroke continued, 'till brought to a neat and graceful Chime, which may be the Finis to that Peal. Thus much in short, for Raising, Round-ring∣ing, and Ceasing a Peal of Bells. FINIS.
