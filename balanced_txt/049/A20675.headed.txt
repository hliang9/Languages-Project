Neptunus nolde within that palace hant. The beriall stremes ryunyng men micht heir By bonkis grene with glancis variant. ❧ For till beholde that heuinly place complete The purgit ayr with new engendrit hete: The soyl enbroude with colowr, vre, and stunt: The tender grene, the balmy droppes swete:

Weil auchtyst the tyl glore and magnify. And with that word I rasyt my vissage Sore effrayit half in a frenisye. ❧ O Nature quene and O ʒe lusty May (Quod I) tho, quhow lang sail I thus foruay? Quhilk ʒowand Venus in this garth deseruis, Reconsell me out of this gret affray. That I maye fynge ʒow laudis day be day. ʒe that al mundane creaturis preseruis. Lonfort ʒour man that in this fanton stetuis. With sprete arrasyt, and euery wit away. Quakyng for fere baith puncys, vane and neruis. ❧ My fatal werd, my febyl wit I wary My dasyt heid quham lake of braue gart veray, And not sustene so amyabyll a soun With ery curage febyl strenthis sary Bownand me hame and list no langer tary Out of the ayr come ane impressioun.

Quhill thair remanit not hir voce nor sycht. Breth motione, nor hetis naturale Saw neuit man so faynt a leuand wycht. And na ferly for ouer excelland lycht. Lorruppis the wit and garrys the blud auaile On tyl the hart that it no danger ale.
Quhen it is smorit, membris wyrkes not richt The dredfull terrour, sua did me assaile. ❧ ʒyt at the last I not quhou long a space A lytell hete aperyt in my face. Quhilk had to fore beyn pale and voyde of blud Tho in my slewen I met a ferly cace. I thought me set within a desert place Amyd a forest by a hydous flud With grysly fysche, And schortly tyl conclud I shall descryue (as god wil geue me grace) Myn auision? in rurell termes rude. Finis.
