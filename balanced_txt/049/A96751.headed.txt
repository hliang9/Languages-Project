Justitiarius justificatus. The Iustice justified. Being, an Apologeticall Remonstrance, delivered to the Honourable Commissioners, of the Great Seale, by George Wither Esquire; and occasioned by Sir Richard Onslow Knight, with some others, who moved to have him put out of the Commission of the Peace, in Surrey: In which private-Defence, many things are expressed, verie pertinent to publike-consideration; and, to the vindication of the Liberties of the Subject, in generall, and of Magistrates, in particular. HOnourable Lords, and Gentlemen, to whose custodie and dispen∣sation, the great Seal and Conscience of this Kingdom is committed; suffer, I beseech you, with patience, that, an humble Servant to the Muses, may, for a few minutes, make his defence before you, against those who have lately abused both Him, and You, by an impertinent Infor∣mation. In the noblest Ages, and most glorious Common-Wealths, they, who were reputed Retainers to Apollo, were ever heard (in making their defences) with good respect; yea, even in those times and places, wherin ge∣nerositie, & civilitie, were least regarded, men had so much wit, that though they secretly hated them, yet, for their owne honour, they usually kept fair quarter, with that Generation: and, it is a symptome of much sottish∣nesse, when men do needlessely ingage themselves by provoking others to the hazzarding of their credit, and quiet. Mistake me not, I pray you, as if I thus began, my Apologie, to intimate some such imprudencie in you, my most honourable Judges; for, I unfainedly professe, that, I neither have any purpose, nor know any just cause, so to doe: but, have made this preamble, only, to hint unto those against whom I plead, what danger they might have incurred, if I had been one of those Wits, whose Iambicks, can  make men their owne executioners; or, if I should have raged-out, an Invective, in blustring Numbers, instead of this Apologie, which I now, calmely, deliver in Prose. But, to the matter. It was my ill fortune (without my own seeking, desire, or fore-know∣ledge thereof, untill it was done) to be made a Commissioner for the Peace and Goale-Delivery in Surrey, since the beginning of this war; and, I fore∣seeing the troubles which I might thereby bring upon my self, by reason of the factiousnesse and malignancie of these times (and the small estate, which the furie of the Common-enemy had left me) thought it good discretion not to accept thereof; and was so resolved, untill that resolution was unhappi∣ly
changed by the perswasion of Friends, who made me believe, that God, by my unsought-for admittance, evidenced his calling of me, to serve him and my Countrey, in her great necessities; and that, honesty and good affecti∣ons joyned with an ordinarie understanding, might make me as servicecable, as some other, who had abler Faculties, and larger Estates. Thereupon, I accepted thereof, because my education in the Vniversity and Innes of Court, made me, as I thought, no lesse capable of that Office then some other of my Fellow-Commissioners; and, because, also, my knowne conversation, my fashion of living, & my being ever since my youth, an acceptable companion to many noble and honourable persons, would render me (as I conceived) a Commissioner without contempt; though most part of my estate was taken away: which, I thank God, I have hitherto been, except among some of those, creatures without understanding, who usually value themselves, and others, according to their Trappings: But, I chiefly accepted thereof, be∣cause I saw many poore soules grievously oppressed by their tyrannous neighbours, and hoped, God would by that Authoritie, enable me to re∣lieve some of them. But, instead of what I then hoped, that, which I feared not, came to passe: For, Sir Richard Onslow, and some other of his Friends in the Countie of Surrey, have as it seems found it pertinent to the establing of their Designs or Government there, that I should be thrust out of the Commission of the Peace, as I have been, out of some Committees, and out of my habitation, for no other causes, but such as are concealed in the breast of the said Sir Richard; who, having got (as it were) the Supremacie over all Causes, and all Persons Ecclesiasticall and Civill, within his Dominions, disposeth of Ele∣ctions, preferreth Deputie-Lievtenants, maketh and unmaketh Justices of the Peace, Committee-men, Colonells, and all other inferiour Militarie Officers, Marshalls, Treasurers, and Collectors, as hee pleaseth; yea, fa∣vours and dis-favours, imposeth and taketh off, imprisons and sets at li∣bertie, builds up and puls downe, armeth and dis-armeth, ordreth and dis-ordreth, according to his discretion, with little or no contradiction. And that his pleasure may be fulfilled in all things, your Honours (as I am in∣formed) have been lately sollicited, by him, to cashiere me from the Bench. At first hearing thereof, I sleighted it as a thing not worthy my regard; and within my selfe, laughed to scorne the poore vanitie of mine Adversa∣rie, who thinks all my honour lyes, as his doth, about Guildford, and the West-Division of Surrey; or, that, my contentment consisteth in having authoritie and power over others, upon such tearmes, and to such frivo∣lous ends, as most men desire, and assume it for: and, thereupon, I thought to passe it over with perpetuall neglect. But, having better consi∣dered thereof, and what encouragement it might give mine enemies, to improve their malice, in matters of more concernment, to my selfe, and perhaps, to the disheartening, and enslaving of others, by his prevailing against mee; I saw it verie necessarie, to take speedy notice of the wrong done: not only, lest my Oppressours should be encouraged to op∣presse me the more; but, lest they might, also, foolishly conceive, that be∣cause
I do not, therefore I could not vindicate my selfe. Vpon this consideration, I have humbly presumed to make an Apologe∣ticall Remonstrance against them and their proceedings, who have appea∣red before you, to do me such an affront, as had been too much, when Ty∣ranny raigned; and is therefore, much lesse to be endured now the Sword is drawne for the Rights, and Liberties, of a Free People. And, though the honour which I care for, and chiefly aime at, is not such as may be added, unto me, or taken from me, at other mens discretions; yet (I being a little sensible of that Disgrace and Reputation, which men of my constitution and frailtie are usually affected withall) have a mind to prevent the scorne of Fooles, if I may, by preserving my credit (through your favour and justice) in keeping that authoritie, which my Adversaries endeavour to take from me; or, else, by making them and their Favourers to see, that, I know how to honour my selfe, twice as much, another way; and, how to hew Staires, out of their Affronts, whereby I may ascend highest, when they think they have brought me to the lowest condition. I need not tell your Honours, how great a disgrace it is thought, to be put out of that Commission: For, you verie well know, it is not usually permitted, save for verie grosse and apparant misdemeanours; and never upon any clandestine, or sleight informations; except, Will stood for Law, and when they kept the Seale, who did arbitrarily put men in, and out, ac∣cording as they were swayed by their own, or by other mens corruptions: of which, I am not jealous at this time; because, I have good hopes of your Equitie, many evidences of mine owne Integritie, and, no feare of my greatest Enemies; except it be, that, they will not desist from causelesly, and foolishly troubling and provoking me, till they compell mee to make all the Kingdome know them by name, and understand their purposes, and condi∣tion, as well as I do. I cannot, therefore, beleeve that persons so honoura∣ble, and so wise as your Lordships, will permit me to be (as if were) kic∣ked off like a foot-ball without hearing; I, having been once reputed wor∣thy to supply the room of a Iudge upon Record; seeing, if such an indigni∣tie should be offered, no man of merit, or of a right understanding, would adventure himselfe upon such a tottering seat as the Sessions-Bench; or, be much incouraged to relieve, and deliver the oppressed, from their injurious and tyrannous neighbours; lest, when he was doing his dutie, and thought himselfe sufficiently authorized to be a comfort to others, he might be secretly disabled, from securing his own person, from disgrace and ruine. Nay, my Lords, it honest men shall be (as it were) purposely set up, to be pulled suddenly downe againe, to their disparagement, without hearing; upon the motion of an Adversarie; yea, and when their conversations and deportments (who are traduced, or sollicited against) have been such, that they dare abe and challenge triall, as I do: Or, if the Office of a Justice of Peace bee but a complement of respect, which you, of higher place, shall think fit to shew us; a thing to be played withall; or, an Ornament to be put upon us, and torne from us againe, at pleasure, according to the hu∣mours, and changeable inclinations of others; let them take it, who are plea∣sed
with such toies; yea, let the greatest fools of the Kingdom monopolize it to themselves: for, I shall be so far from desiring to be continued in it, on those tearmes, that, I shall scorn it, as fitting for none, but sneaking, baffel'd, and poore-spirited Fellowes. But, the Dignitie of that Trust and employment, is indeed so honoura∣ble, and the due execution thereof is of so much consequence, that it ought to be preserved from contempt, by being conferred on persons deliberately chosen, and eminent where they live, for their understanding and upright∣nesse, having, also, estates competently sufficient, to bear the charge of their Magistracie, and to be answerable for their over-sights: And, when such are once authorized, it is fitting that their reputation should be preserved, so long as they continue in their integritie, & that they stand not in hazard of a disgraceful removal, by the dis-favour, or secret supplantings of other men, so long as they are able and willing to serve their Countrey. For to con∣fer that, or any other Office of Judicature (for an uncertaine terme) Du∣ranti bene placito, expressively or implicitely intended, rather than with this clause, Quàm diu se bene gesserit, was the practice of Tyrants, who intended, thereby, to make their Officers the more serviceable to their Arbitrarie Designes; and, therfore, it ought not to be endured in a free and well-governed Common-wealth: especially, in a time when Reforma∣tion is intended, and by us, who have had experience often, and lately, to our cost and smart, that, when men were conscionable of their duties, and active in the execution of Justice, according to the letter and equitie of the Lawes, (without fear or respect of persons) it was usuall to remove them with disgrace; and to supply their places, with such as would be conformable to the corrupt will and pleasure of tyrannous Princes, and their Parasiticall Favourites and Counsellours, to the publike detriment, and dishonour. And, doubtlesse, when a man (which is my case) who never sought for it, or desired it, shall be called to an Office of trust, and made to pay great fees for being admitted, and for accepting to do the publike service, to his own trouble, and further cost, without profit; if then, and, even, after he hath faithfully executed the same (to the accumulating of hatred to himselfe, for doing justice) he shall be disgracefully cast out, before hearing, or any Cause showne, be left a cashiered Officer upon record; it is an injurie justly to be complained of, and fit to be remedied, and provided against. I cannot imagine, that, the Gentlemen who took pains to appear, and sollicite your Honours against mee, brought any considerable argument to prove reasonable that which they desired; or, that the displacing of me, was any thing pertinent to the well-governing of Surrey; nor have I yet any certaintie of what they alleaged, because nothing is upon record. But, what moved some of them against mee, I do verie well know; yea, and why they are so desirous to be rid of my fellowship, and neighbourhood in Surrey: which, I will forbear now to mention; and, that I may be the more sure to take off all those just exceptions, which, in my understanding, may seem helpfull to accomplish their purpose, I will suppose objections, and make distinct answers unto them, for my vindication.
All Objections, which I think can justly be made against thee, or any other, to render him uncapable or unworthy to be continued a Commissio∣ner of Peace, must either concern his manners, his Religion, his knowledge or judgement, his faithfulnesse to Supreme Authoritie, his uprightnesse in the execution of his Office, or the Competencie of his estate; and I will make it apparent, that in all these respects, I am as little to be excepted against, as some of those, who are, yet, to be continued in Commission, with their good liking, who have excepted against me: yea, I presume I shall approve my self free from any just exception, (notwithstanding the Statute) the times, and the present condition of this Realme, being rightly considered. As touching my manners, my life, and conversation, (though I am a great sinner to God) I thinke no man hath impudence enough to lay any thing to my charge; no, not Sir Richard Onslow, who I am confident would not spare to discover any thing, whereby he might safely, and just∣ly, disparage and undo me; and, therefore, I will apologize for my selfe no further in that respect, untill he, or some other, shall accuse me. My Religion teacheth me to renounce the Popes Supremacie, and, that is Re∣ligion enough, to keep mee still in the Commission of the Peace, though I professed no more; therefore, I shall not need to catechize my selfe, or to make a larger Confession of my faith, upon this Occasion. My knowledge and judgement, hath, hitherto, been as seldom, and as little questioned as any of my neighbours: and, if it be but sufficient (as I hope it is) to en∣able me to speake, and discharge my dutie, without the controule or ad∣vice of my Clerk, I am perswaded, it is more sufficiencie, then all my Fellow-Justices, throughout this Kingdome, may truly boast of. My faithfulnesse to the State, is so over-much evidenced to my dammage at this present, and so generally knowne, by my expressions and sufferings, heretofore, as well as by my great losses, disbursements, endeavours, and the hazarding of my life, in this War, that, most men of qualitie in these parts, do repute mee a man, to be unquestionably confided in, by the State; and in my conscience, if it had been otherwise, some who are now mine Eenemies, would have been my verie good Friends. In the execution of my Office, I have neither denyed, delayed, or per∣verted Iustice, since my admission thereunto; nor put anie man to so much cost for it, as the expence of one Clerks-Fee; because, I have hitherto dis∣patched all businesses with my one hand, and am loth to put any man to more charge then need requires. I confesse, I have not acted so much in the duties of that place, as the many disorders, and the prophanenesse of many among us requires; by reason, that, some of those, who now labour to put me out of the Commission, have done what in them lies to drive me out of the County also, and have made my residence, there, to be of late verie seldome and uncertain: yea, and as far as they dared, they have done me disrespects, and discourtesies (if I may terme them no worse) in the ex∣ecution of all my Warrants, which have come to their knowledge; and laboured to make me vile, and contemptible, among my neighbours, with∣out cause.
For, when I had sent my Warrant for a dangerous Knave and a Whore, who had travelled together out of Surrey, into the Kings Quarters (per∣haps, imployed to conveigh intelligence) and, who lived in manifest un∣cleannesse, at their returne; these (refusing contemptuously to be obedient to my Authority) were countenanced therein, to my disgrace; and to the incouragement of such varlets, and base people, in their contempts, and fil∣thinesse. And, whereas I had lately committed two suspitious fellowes, upon very strong probabilities of horse-stealing, and had signified what e∣vidence I had of their being dangerous persons, and not fit to be bailed, but by very good sureties; some of these Gentlemen, having the Prisoners carried afterwards before them, by the Constable, (who was to have con∣veighed them immediately to the Goale, according to his duty, and my Warrant) the matter was (as it seemeth) so sleighted, that the said Constable suffered one of them, negligently, or wilfully, to escape that night: and, for the other, a few weeks after, mean Baile was taken, by one, or moe of the said Gentlemen; not without scandalous intimations (as I have heard) that the poore fellow was not, by me, proceeded against, so much for being a suspitious person, as for that I thought thereby to get his horse; he being apprehended, in a Mannour where the Felons goods belong unto me: of which intimation, if any of them were guilty, it implies an inveterate malice, much to be taken heed of: and if my reputation stood in need to be cleared from such a base aspersion, it will be vindicated at the next Goale-deliverie in Surrey: For, the same partie whom they so bailed, as a man whom I suspected, not without evident cause, hath (since he was let forth upon Baile) committed divers other Felonies; and, is now, re∣apprehended, and, a prisoner againe, by my diligence. Now, if the exception made against me, be grounded upon that obso∣lete Statute which requires everie Justice of Peace to have Land of inhe∣ritance, of such, or such an yearly value, in the County (which, I am cer∣taine is all that can be reasonably objected to have me put out of Commis∣sion) then, there is a coulerable exception against me: For, indeed, I have no inheritance there, but onely a hundred pounds per annum for a terme to come, and some possibilities of more hereafter. And, if I shall be remo∣ved for that only; then, my removall is without any fault of mine: For, it is not meerly my fault, (and I think your Honours will believe it) that I have not land enough to be a Iustice of Peace, in everie County of the Kingdome: nor doth, indeed, either the practise, or constitution of the times require the strict observance of that Statue, but permits, and necessitates a dispensation thereof: And, some, even in that County, who have not estates there answerable to the Letter of the Law, are, never∣thelesse, kept still in Commission; and were first admitted (as I am infor∣med) by means of some, or one of those, who seek to have mee cast out, for the same inconsiderable defect. Amongst which persons, there are two verie observeable; one of them (who hath but a little plot of Osiers in that Countie) is so well befriended at Oxford, that (as I am credibly in∣formed) he had lately a Warrant for Venisen out the walled park near King∣ston,
under the Kings own hand: the other, who, seems to be either Ad∣vocate or Sollicitor Generall for Delinquents, at Kingston-Committee, hath no more but a poore Potters cottage near Chertsey in that Countie, of about eight pounds per annum. There, is otherwhile, as much need of wit and honesty, in the execution of that Office, as of a Landed-man. Men of large fortunes, and little conscience, have so long ingrossed places of Power, and Trust, and made such use of Magistracie, for private and si∣nister ends, that, they have destroyed our Peace, and indangered all our Freedomes: and, therefore, it is now requisite (and, God, in justice, will so have it) that, the stout, faithfull, and prudent Citizens, and the men of midling-Fortunes, who were heretofore scorned and oppressed, should be called into Office and imployment, that (if it be possible) their courage, wis∣dome, pietie, and integritie, might help our honourable Senators, to redeeme us from those miseries, and slaveries, into which the Canibals of the Court, and the Sagamores of the Countrey▪ have by their pride, and perfidi∣ousnesse, lately brought us. And, doubtlesse, though this temporarie cause of dispensing with the Statute were removed, it were no intrenchment upon the true intent and equity of the Law (according to which your Court ought to judge) if a Iustice of Peace be continued, who hath a personall e∣state, sufficient to keep his Authority from contempt; and, to inable the discharge of his dutie: especially, if the Kingdome be so much indebted un∣to him (as it is now to me, even in the same Countie where I am a Com∣missioner) that, it may suffice to repaire, all publike, and private dammages also, which may be sustained by the Iustices Imprudence, neglect, or cor∣ruption. Sure I am, if none should be Commissioners of the Peace, in some Counties, as our affaires now stand, but great Landlords; there would be little hope of equity, in many places. Having thus pleaded to every exception, which may be colourably made against me; I could say somwhat els, lying now at my torgues end, which if it were plainly expressed, and could be as well proved to others, as it is manifest to my selfe, would, perhaps, both continue me in the Commission of the Peace, and make me of the Quorum also, if it were uttered in a good houre: But, because good dayes, and houres, are verie rare and uncertaine with me; and, lest a worse thing may befall me, than putting out of Com∣mission (if it be ill timed) I will silence my present thoughts, for ever; or un∣till I see such a day, as may give them a happie birth, without hazard: and, I will now expresse somewhat, to take away that rigid opinion of me, which may, perhaps, be entertained, by reason, so many Gentlemen of Surrey have appeared with Sir Richard Onslow, to sollicite your Honours to put me out of Commission. For, doubtles, it could not but make the whole Court, and all there present, who knew me not, to conceive unworthily of me; and therefore, though not for mine owne sake, yet for the sake of that which God hath heretofore enabled mee to expresse, concerning this Nation, and the judgements now upon us (which may, else, be made the lesse regarded, and the lesse effectuall to those who read me) it seems neces∣sarie, that I should apologize, a little, to that purpose.
If I did not know, that to be an honest man, and a profest enemy to cor∣ruption and oppressions, were enough to make me hated and persecuted of some men; or, if experience had not acquainted me, how cunningly some can draw in others, to make their presence a countenance to their designes, who know not why they are called (as, by their own confession to me, it fared with some who accompanied Sir Richard Onslow to your Honours) I should have much wondred, that, so many Gentlemen should have con∣curred in so discourteous an office, considering, most of them have seemed to respect me, and are men whom I love and honour; and, considering also, how civilly I have ever behaved my selfe toward them, and all other of that Countie, not withstanding many provocations to the contrarie. For, I solemnly protest before God, that, to my remembrance, I do not know any person in Surrey, with whom I had any quarrell, or unkind contestation, before this War, or since it began, but, with respects, meerly to the Publike Cause; neither any one, whom I have, wittingly, wronged so much, in deed or word, but, that, one penny will make satisfaction, for the whole injurie, seven-fold. Nay, I have not done to any one of those Gen∣tlemen so much as a seeming injurie, or dis-respect, except, it seemeth a dis∣respect, to have refused to joyne with some of them in the erecting of Alc-houses, or in such like concurrences, which I thought unfitting to be assented unto: Or, except it may seeme a dis-respect to Sir Ri∣chard Onslow, that I lately set at libertie a poore man, whom (as I con∣ceive) hee had arbitrarily, and wrongfully committed, without cause shewne, to the infringement of the just Freedomes of the people, and the Lawes of the Land: Or, except he thinks it a dis-respect unto him (as I have heard he takes it to be, with an imputation of ingratitude unto mee) that, I will not acknowledge my selfe to have been made Captaine of the Horse first raised in Surrey, for the Parliament, meerly, by his friendship; whereas, he, and the Countie knowes, I was made choyce of, by the Well-affected, before he had any thought of me to that purpose; yea, and in oppo∣sition to his election: For (till he saw it would be in vain) hee laboured to bring in the son in Law of Mr. Muschamp, then, reputed a violent Ma∣lignant; and the Gentleman whom hee would have made Captaine, was not, at that time, barely suspected, but so really a Malignant, that hee be∣came, soone after, a Commander for the King; where (I verily beleeve) hee did him worse service, than hee might have done, had hee commanded those Horse in Surrey. Or, except it seemeth a dis-respect to Sir Richard, that I would not re-admit upon his Letter, (and upon his engagement un∣to me for him) the naturall son of the said Mr. Muscamp, to be Cornet of my Troop; out of which place (the said Sir Richard having preferred him thereto) I cashiered him, because hee behaved himselfe mutinously, and sought to allure away my Troopers, and my Lievtenant to serve the King; unto whom the said Cornet went, shortly after, and was made a Captain also. My Lievtenant, being likewise of Sir Richard Onslow's owne choice, I was forced to cashiere, as well because he leaned the same way, as for other misdemeanours. Or, except it seems a dis-respect, to Sir Richard,
that, before his consent thereunto, I was (without my seeking or know∣ledge thereof, untill it was determined) freely, and unanimously nomi∣nated for Colonell, by the Committee of the Militia for Surrey, (being a very full Committee sitting at Kingston) and was (by the same Committee) Au∣gust 7. 1644. ordered to take charge of all Forces, then raised, and to be raised, in the East, and middle Divisions of Surrey; and, that, I presumed to accept therof, without Sir Richard Onslowes consent; who, indeed, was much out of patitience there with, and could never after be at quiet, untill he had contrived the new modelling of the Militia, there, according to his own fancie; For, thereupon he procured the reducement therof under the Lievtenancie again, by which &c. Or, except it seeme a dis-respect, unto the said Sir Richard, that when he offered to be Commander in chief, over the whole Militia in Surrey, and to make mee his Lievtenant-Colonell, I refused the same, thinking it no discretion to quit a superiour, for an inferiour Command; or, to hazard the being twice deceived, by one man; or, to subject my self, to him, who (I thought) regarded neither my profit, nor my credit, nor my life: and, I partly refused it, because I was loath to be sharer with him in the honour gotten (if I may so call it) at the siege of Basing; which was famous, at that time, through the whole Kingdom. Or, except it seem a dis-respect unto him, that I seldome concurred with him, in his designes; especially, in his opposition to the Association; in his arming Malignants, and others promiscuously; and, in his putting the Coun∣ty into those postures, and to those excessive-impertinent charges, and trou∣bles, which, in my judgment, were more likelie (by weakening, and dis∣contening the people) to indanger, then to secure, those parts. Or, un∣lesse he conceive it a dis-respect unto him, that, when in my Se-Defendendo, I publikely vindicated my selfe, from being anie way blameable, that, Farn∣ham-Castle (whereof I had command at the beginning of this warre) was left imprudently (if not treacherously) to the Enemy; and so clea∣red my selfe, that, I thereby gave those who were unsatisfied, occasion to seek further, and lay the fault where it was. Or, except it seem a dis-respect to Sir Richard Onslow, that I should say, I thought, his procuring me to be put into the fore-said Castle, was not for that end which he first pre∣tended: For, when I consider the series, and concatenation of his procee∣dings in Surrey, and his continuing-endeavours, from time, to time, in pro∣secutions, with reference to that Castle, (with the manifold charges, distur∣bances, and divisions, which have been occasioned, by his restlesse seeking to accommplish some secret designe of his own, which, I conceive he hath, or hath had, upon that Place) I am still, so perswaded, my thoughts have therein done him no wrong; that, I professe againe, I do verily believe, he hath aimed at some establishment there, for his own advantage, ever since the warre began: and, that he hath thereby occasioned most of the miseries which have wasted Hampshire, and Surrey; and, because this beleefe shall not appeare to bee without a Foundation, I will, out of a long chaine of rea∣sons, linked into each other, present you with a few. The reason why I do beleeve, that hee, the said Sir Richard, occasioned
much of the spoyle made in Hamp-shire and Surrey; is, for that, it seemeth unto me, to be chiefly (if not altogether) his fault, that a strong Garrison was not established at Farnham, when the command thereof was first given unto me: For, had that Southerne passage to London been strongly guarded, by well fortifying of Farnham, for the present, and by removing the Garrison afterward to Basing (according to my designe then proposed) wee should have so comforted, and encreased, the Well-affected; and so discouraged, and suppressed Malignants, that, many of those occasions would have been pre∣vented, which drew both Parties, so often, that way, to the impoverishing, and discontenting of those Counties; yea, and a little charge (in respect of what was afterward necessitated) would, at first, have kept out the floud, which made the first breach, and spoyl; and which, being once made, could ne∣ver since be stopped so strongly up, but that everie little Torrent broke in upon us; to the encreasing, or prolonging, of our afflictions. The reasons, why I beleeve it his fault, that, for preventing these mis∣chiefs, a strong Garrison was not timely compleated at Farnham, are these: Vpon due examination, of his beginning and his proceedings, I could perceive no assurance, that he intended to fortifie it; unles it might be for such ends as he secretly purposed: For, the Commission, wherby I was made Governor (thogh procured, by Sir Richard, in my Name, and delivered to me) was so drawn up, that, what I seemed to be, I was not. He himselfe, and another, had a super∣intendencie over me, and I was, from them, to expect Orders, Ammunition, Provisions, Armes, and all the Forces, which I was likely to have; and, no∣thing was left in my power, but the disciplining of my Horse, (of Foot, when I could get them) and the guarding of undefensible, and bare walls, without works, or so much as strong gates; which, to make the place more tenable, ought speedily to have been looked unto, and provided for, in time; as might have been, and, as the opinion, which I then had of Sir Richard Onflow made me hope it should be. But, after many messages, visits, (and the keeping of Dawes, and Crowes, there, till I was ashamed of my command) Sir Ri∣chard himselfe came unto mee, and, in stead of what I expected, perswaded me to quit my Government of the Castle, and to betake my selfe to my Troop only, as likely to be of longest continuance: For, (said hee) though I procu∣red you this command, for the present, and, to avovd surprisall by the Ene∣my; it is not purposed, it shall be long held for a Garrison; and, that if it should be so continued, yet, I could not then command both. Vpon which overture, if (as perhaps was expected) I had perswaded him, to assume the govern∣ment upon himselfe, and, so complyed with him, that he might commendably have taken, thereby, occasion also, to have so contrived it; I am perswaded, I had, then, answered his expectation: But, I bluntly replyed to this effect: That I knew the place of such concernment, as would make it of ill consequence, if it were not speedily fortified, and continued defensible; that, to have the kee∣ping of an Inland-Garrison, without Horse (an Enemie being in the field) was a kind of imprisonment; that, I, having taken upon mee the trust, and profession of a Souldier, it would be dishonourable to mee, to give up the best part of my Command, to mine owne disadvantage, without any securitie, or
benefit to the Publike; and, that therefore, I would not assent thereunuo, un∣till I saw no remedy: which, gave him so little contentment, that, with some faint promises of supply, he departed; and, never sent mee any thing af∣terward, but words, and discouragements; untill I, and my Troop, were called thence, to the undoing of the Countie, & to the plundring of my estate, by leaving the Castle to the possession of the Enemy: And, from that time till this, hee hath never been my friend, but sometimes from the teeth outwards; and apparently injurious to me, oftentimes. Other reasons I have, moving mee to beleeve what is afore said, which I will omit till further occasion. If the said Sir Richard conceive, that such thoughts, and such a beleefe of him, as is afore expressed, are a wrong unto him; or, if it be injurious unto him, for me to think (as, I confesse, I do, upon vetie good grounds, in my opinion) that he is the greatest Favourer of Delinquents, and the most bitter, and implacable Enemy to them, who are eminently Well-affected to the Par∣liament, of any man in Surrey, so much pretending the contrarie, as he hath done; Verily, he himselfe, and not I, is cause of the injurie (if any be) by giving many occasions of such thoughts, and beleefe of him, as make it im∣possible for me, yea, and (as I heare) for many hundreds, to beleeve other∣wise. It had been possible for me, to have concealed this beleefe, if his pro∣vocations, and the perpetuitie of his malice, had not necessitated an expression thereof; as well, heretofore, for the Publike Securitie; as now, for my pri∣vate vindication; and he had sooner heard of it, but that wee knew not how to make approaches, for defence of the safetie, and priviledges belonging to the Whole Body of the Commonaltie, without endangering our ruine, by see∣ming to violate the Sanctuary of personall priviledges, though we did but break thorow their incroachments, to do our duties. These particulars considered, Sir Richard Onslow might have manifested more prudence, by forbearing, to provoke mee beyond all moderation; for, the patient creature, who can passe by scornes, and injuries, or let a Foole ride him, three or foure yeares together, without kicking, or hurling his Rider into dirt, may be pinched in such a place, or Wither-gall'd in such a hot season, that his wronged patience may, perchance, turne into madnesse, and so, both the Foole, and the Asse, mischiefe each other. The heaving of me from the Seat of Magistracie, is not that which now moves mee to make this Vindication, though it occasions it; but, the consequences, which are ex∣pected, should follow: For, I was once before put into authoritie, and out againe, ere I knew either the one, or the other; or, without so much as as∣king, or caring, who did it, or why it was done: For, I can be as merrie, and as wise, when I am out of authoritie, as when I am a Justice of the Peace; my Friends love me as well, my Companions think I am as good company, and (if I have not too high an opinion of mine own good dispossition) the Gentle∣men, who have taken so much paines, to put me out of their Fellowship, may have a worse Companion, than I have hitherto been. For, I am not such a Cynick, as manie, who know me not, have sup∣posed me to be; but, can sit at a Sessions, or Weekly-meeting, and heare some of my worshipfull Associates, make long speeches, to the Countrey-people,
without envying the wisdome, which is attributed unto them, for it: and, whether they speake sense, or, non-sence; impertinencies, or, to the purpose, it never much troubles me, so businesses be timely dispatched, and, our duties honestly performed, at the last. I could, also, verie contentedly, continue silent by them, upon the Bench, and permit them to have all the talk, and the mannaging of everie businesse, without interruption; yea, and suffer them to reprove, or incourage, as there was cause; or, to the advance∣ment of their own repute, without striving to put in my word, or my opi∣nion, when it seemed needlesse; except it were, that, the people might take notice of mee, and know mee to bee a man in authoritie, as well as they: And when the merit of the Cause, the furtherance of Justice, or the prevention of an injurie, likely to befall any man, shall move mee to speak, I love to do it, in as few words, as I can; that, they whose custome it is, may have time to heare themselves speake, if any such bee present. I hope (though I have heard so) there is no man among them so foolish, as to think me a disparagement to the Commission, because I have the title of a Poet; for, King Iames was so ambitious to be so called, that he preferred a Wreath of Lawrell (the Poets Crowne) before his Golden Diadem, as ap∣peares by some of his coines, and medalls: yea, that title, hath been, by the learned, reputed an honour, even to Salomon, and David; the translation of whose holy Songs, and Psalmes, by me, into Lyrick numbers, hath beene a means, so to sanctifie my Poesie, for divine uses; that, this Faculty will not now render mee despicable, but among Barbarians; and, how they e∣steem of me, I care not. My Lords, I perceive, this pursuit of my slipperie Iustice-ship, hath made my pen out-run the Constable, before I am aware: I will therfore, add a concluding dash or two, and make an end. I doat not so upon sitting upon the Bench, with Sir Richard Onslow, as to be sollicitous, for mine own sake, whether I am in, or out of the Commission, for ever: But, for my Countrey-sake, and for the preservation of the Priviledges, due to a Free-Subject, I could not permit your candor, and credulitie, to be abused, by remaining mis-informed; nor will my pen to be at rest, untill I shall be fairly heard, to the repaire of my credit, (if any be lost) and, to the repossessing of that respect which is due to a faithfull Officer: Nor will I be silent (if a patch of Freehold be so con∣siderable, that no worth or desert is to be regarded without it) till I have, at least, such a proportion of my Losses, Disbursements, and Arreares, paid unto me, as will buy me so much land of inheritance, as may make me a more considerable man in that Countie, where they have sought to disgrace me. No, nor will I then be silent, untill I see the Law, by which my Justice-ship is questioned, to be executed, or dispensed, equally, to all men, without partialitie; and, untill the election, and continuance, of all such Officers, as are, or were, ordained for preservation of Peace, the distribution, or execution of Iustice, and the safety of the Peoples lives, and Liberties, reduced to what (by Law, or equity) they ought to be. My hope, to see that effected, makes me indure, the more patiently, the scorne now cast upon me, in requitall of all my losses, sufferings, hazzards,
and the forbearance of my Arrears. And, I doubt not but there will come a day, in which I shall not be thought so impertinent, as some of my neigh∣bours, in Surrey, now think me to be: but, may perhaps (without fawning, or bribing for it) be thought as fit to serve in my own Countrey, in some place of profit, and credit, as to governe in the Summer-Islands, whither I should have been sent, last yeare, (and whither I would willingly have gone, if my losses, and arrears, might have been first obtained, to fit me for the voy∣age) upon hope whereof, though that which is due to me for my Service, and by the Publike Faith, is enough (beside my long forbearance thereof) to pur∣chase more then ten times so much land in anie Countie of this Kingdom, at this day, as a Iustice of Peace is required to have; And, though I cannot yet be dispensed withall, as well as my neighbours, I wil, neverthelesse, attend patiently, till that day of favour comes; and untill the Starres, both of the greater, and lesser magnitudes, in our English Firmament, shall meet in a Constellation, which will be more favourable to me; and, make my inconsi∣derable defects, as little liable to exceptions, as other mens. I perceive, many other, aswell as my selfe, exposed to such usages, who are wearie of complaining; or, who dare not complaine, least they may be used worse, by those, who have the advantages of Time, and Place, openly, to illustrate their own praise, and, secretly, to disparage other men. I see, daily, that they, who were generally reputed the most dangerous Malig∣nants, and, who never shewed themselves for the Parliament, but by com∣pulsion, (or, untill it began, evidently, to prevail) are, now, become power∣full among us: yea, they are politikely ingratiated, indeered, and brought insensibly in, to strengthen a Party against those, who (from the beginning) have acted faithfully, and freely, for the publike; and, for the discoverie of their neutralitie, and dis-affection, who, by now seeming to be with us, will more undo us, and more dis-advantage the Common-safety, then all our open-Enemies; yea, and make our habitations unsecure, and our lives, for ever, miserable unto us, if their combinations, and purposes, be not timely prevented, by some Ordinance, forbidding the admission of anie such to be in Authoritie. For, some of them are already in Surrey (as I hear) and elswhere, in spight of the well-affected, made Committee-men, Commissioners of the Peace, Deputy-Lievtenants, Colonells, Captaines, and other Militarie Of∣ficers, (I will not, yet, say Parliament-men, though I thinke I might) to the grievance, and oppression of manie, who dare not seek Remedy lest it prove worse to them then the Disease. Insomuch, that it is evident to me (and, as I believe, plain to manie thousands) that, some have an intention, to discountenance, and disgrace, by degrees, those who have been eminently zealous, and freely bountifull of their blood, and estates, for the Common-liberty, and safety; and, are putting themselves and their Confederates, into such a posture, as may probably, enable them, to continue the people in sla∣verie to their pride, and arbitrarie pleasure, when advantages may be securely taken: which advantages, may, no way, be more safely gained, then by put∣ting those out of Authoritie, who have been a comfort to the well-affected from the beginning; and, placing in their stead, those, who may discounte∣nance
them, and incourage their malignant neighbours, as they do in Surrey, and elswhere, also, as I am informed. Your Lordships will, perhaps, think me tedious, over-bold, and somwhat impertinent, in this Apologie, and Remonstrance; but, you would excuse my tediousnesse, if you knew experimentally, how hard it is for a man to be si∣lent, when he hath once gotten an opportunitie to speake (of those things which are grievous unto him) before Persons, whom he thinks able to give him some ease; and, you will, I hope, pardon also, my bluntnesse, and di∣gressions, when you see (as in my Cause) what neare relations the pub∣like-grievances, and the private-sufferings of honest men, have one to another, justly occasioning some transitions from private, to publike, and from publike, to private considerations, to the lengthening of discourses, be∣yond our intentions. It may be thought, likewise, at first apprehension (& to my disavantage, if it be so taken) that, I have scandalized a Member of the Honourable House of Commons, by nominating Sir R. Onslow, in this Apologie; but, I desire it may be seriously considered, how essentiall it was unto my effectuall justification, that I should nominate him; and, in what manner, and, with what circum∣stances I have done it; for, I think it will then appeare, to the wisdome of the rest of the Members, that I have done my selfe right, without wronging Them, or Him: If it prove otherwise, I shall repent, and acknowledge my errour, with much contrition. For, I prefer the preservation of their just Priviledges, and Honour, so far before mine owne reputation (though I pre∣fer that before my life) that, I would expose my selfe to any hazard, rather than to prosecute mine owne vindication, by wilfull intrenching upon their Essentiall-Priviledges. And, I am perswaded, I so well know, how to di∣stinguish between Scandalum datum, and Scandalum acceptum, that, I doubt not, but to make it evident (if it be any way questionable) that, I have kept within the Spheare of mine owne Priviledges; and, that it is possible, to pursue such an Adversarie, even to the Hornes of the Altar, and, yet, not pol∣lute the Sanctuarie. The Common-wealth is more indangered by Mutes, then by Vowells; by Flatterers, then Free-speakers; and more dishonoured, by some of their owne Members, who are over-violently zealous for personall Priviledges, then by anie of those, who, out of care, to preserve the whole Body, may wring a part of it, for a while, by mistake, or mis-information. There was an Ananias among the Disciples, without any disparagement to the rest; and as there have been False-Brethren, among the Lords, and Commons, hereto∣fore, so there may be, now, and hereafter, notwithstanding any assurance we have to the contrarie. Therefore, to those who are upright in the Houses, and unto the whole Commen-wealth, we do more wrong, in being afraid to speak freely, and plainly, of those corruptions, and of those Persons, whom we think in our consciences, may occasion publike detriments and dangers, then we can do injurie, by disclosing of them, according to our Covenant, and duty; though it should be done with some indiscretion, and circumstances, to the disparagement of a particular Member; seeing, it were better that
one should suffer, then, that, all should be indangered, by our silence. This, is my judgement; and, my practice hath been accordingly, all my life; yet, I have not, either directly, or personally, charged any one hither∣to; partly, because, I apparently know manie things to be true, which I cannot prove legally, to other men: but, principally, because, I love not to be an Accuser of my brethren, or, a prosecutor of other mens infir∣mities, to their open personall suffering, so long as I may have hope to do it se∣cretly, for their reformation, and without doing wrong, to the publike. But, if I find not the Insolencies of some men to be speedily reformed; and the good Affections, losses, and services, of those, who have borne, and forborne, for publike-respects, to be better represented to the Parliament, (who, being o∣verburthened by the multiplicitie of emergent affaires, daily renewing, and pressing upon them, cannot discover some things by sitting in the House, which we see, too often, by walking abroad) I shall be more particular in my reproofs hereafter, then I have been heretofore, whatever come on it: and, though I cannot, perhaps, deliver my selfe, from disgrace, and that undoing, which my Adversaries threaten; yet, I will perish to some purpose (if I must perish) by sacrificing my endeavours (and life, if need be) for the reliefe of my Fellow-sufferers, whose patience is almost quite lost by their practices, who, by pretending to act with, and for the Parliament, doe secretly, and cunningly, what they can, to bring dis-honour, and contempt thereup∣on, by their hypocrisie, and injustice, which, I pray God to prevent: and, to let me live no longer, then I shall purpose, and endeavour (according to my understanding) to preserve the power and reputation, of that Su∣preme Court, in whatsoever I publish, or speake; though some Members thereof, do, now, and may hereafter, forget their duties, as others have done heretofore; and, may thereby force me to expresse somewhat, for the pur∣ging of a corrupt-part, that the health and life, of the whole, may be preserved. If, therefore, my Tongue, or my Pen, shall now, or, at any time, slip through indiscretion, or frailtie, let me be considered, according to the pro∣babilitie of my good intention, and the sorrow which I shall expresse for my oversights: For, I desire to preserve a good opinion with your Honours, and, with all men, if it may be, in the performance of my duties; and, that those, whom I love and honour, as I do your Lordships, and the two Houses, (whereof you are Members) may not, at this time, be made Instruments of my disparagement, without cause: Seeing, if my heart were as legible as my words, it would be no contentment unto you, that I should be sen∣tenced, before you had heard as well what might be spoken for mee, as against me; neither would you thinke it added any thing to your honour, if when your short terme of Authority is expired. I should be left in worse repute, by your Act, then I was at the late renewing of your owne Commis∣sion. But. Fiat voluntas Dei, I have discharged my conscience, and, am assu∣red, that God, who hath manie times heretofore delivered me from power∣full, and malitious Enemies, to my reputation, and their shame, will be as mercifull unto mee, now, and hereafter. GEO. WITHER.
