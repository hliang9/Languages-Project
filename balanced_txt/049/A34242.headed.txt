THE CONFESSION OF FAITH First agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster. And now appointed by the General assembly of the Kirk of of Scotland to be a part of Unifor∣mity in Religion, between the Kirks of Christ in the three Kingdoms. CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture. ALthough the light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence, do so far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom, and Power of God, as to leave men
unexcusable Rom. 2.14.15. Rom. 1.19.20, Psal. 19.1, 2, 3. Rom. 1.32.; yet they are not suffi∣cient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will, which is necessary uno salvation 1 Cor. 1.11. & 2.14.15.. Therefore it plea∣sed the Lord at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his Will unto his Church Heb. 1.1.; and afterwards for the better preserving, and propaga∣ting of the Truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Sathan and of the World; to commit the same wholly unto writing Pro. 22· 19, 20, 21. Luk 1.3, 4. Rom 15.4. Mat. 4.4, , 10. Isa 8.19, 20; which makes the holy Scripture to be most necessary 2 Tim. 3.15.; those former ways of Gods revealing his will unto his People, being now ceased Heb. 1.1, 2. 2 Pet. 1.19.. II. Under the Name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the Books of the Old and new Testa∣ment, which are these.
Of the Old Testament. GEnesis. Exodus. Leviticus. Numbers. Deuteronomie. Joshua. Judges. Ruth. I. Samuel. II. Samuel. I. Kings. II. Kings. I. Chronicles. II. Chronicles. Ezra. Nehemiah. Esther. Job. Psalms. Proverbs. Ecclesiastes. The Song of Songs Isajah. Jeremiah. Lamentations. Ezekiel. Daniel. Hosea. Joel. Amos. Obadiah. Jonah. Micah. Nahum. Habakkuk. Zephaniah. Haggai. Zechariah. Malachi.
Of the New Testament. The Gospel according to MAtthew. The Gospel according to Mark. The Gospel according to Luke. The Gospel according to John. The Acts of the Apostles. Paul's Epistle to the Romans. I. Corinthians. II. Corinthians. Galatians. Ephesians. Philippians. Colossians. I. Thessalonians. II. Thessalonians. To Timothy. I. To Timothy. II. To Titus. To Philemon. The Epistle to the Hebrews. The Epistle of James. The first and se∣cond Epistle of Peter. The first, second and third Epi∣stles of John. The Epistle of Jude. The Revelations.
All which are given by inspirati∣on of God, to be the Rule of Faith and life Luk. 16.29.31. Eph. 3.20. Rev. 22.18.19. 2 Tim. 3.16.. III. The Books commonly cal∣led Apocrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are no part of the Ca∣non of the Scripture; and therefore are of no Authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise ap∣proved, or made use of, than other humane writings Luk. 24.27, 44. Rom. 3.2. 2 Pet. 1.21.. IV. The Authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obey'd; dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.2 Pet. 1.19 21. 2 Tim. 3.16. 1 Ioh. 5.9. 1 Thes. 2.13.. V. We may be moved & induced by the testimony of the Church, to an high and reverend esteem of the holy Scripture 1 Tim. 3.15.. And the heavenli∣ness of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the Majesty of the stile, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God,) the full dis∣covery it makes of the only way of mans salvation, the many other in∣comparable Excellencies, and the
intire perfection thereof, are Argu∣ments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full perswasion and assurance of the in∣fallible truth, and Divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by, and with the Word in our hearts Ioh. 2.20, 27. Ioh. 16.13 14▪ 1 Cor. 2.10.11, 12▪ Isa. 59.21.. VI. The whole Counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own Glory, mans Salvation, Faith, and life, is either exprsly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary conseqence may be de∣ducd from Scripture: uno which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the spirit, or traditions of men 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17. Gal. 1.8, 9. 2 Thes. 2.2.. Never∣theless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary, for the saving under∣standing of such things as are revea∣led in the word Ioh. 6.45. 1 Cor. 2.9, 10, 11, 12.: and that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God, and Government of the Church, cmmon to humane Actions and Societies, which are to be ordered by the light of Nature, and Christian rudence, according to the general Rules of the Word
which are alwaies to be observed 1 Cor. 11.13, 14. 1 Cor. 14.26, 40.. VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all2 Pet. 3.6.: yet those things which are necessary to be known believed, and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and ope∣ned in some places of Scripture or other, that not only the Learned but the Unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them Ps. 119.103, 130.. VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the Native Language of the people of God of Old) and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it, was most generally known to the Nations) being im∣mediately inspired by God, and by his singular care & providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore Au∣thentical Mat. 5.1, so as in all controver∣sies of Religion, the Church is final∣ly to appeal unto them Isa. 8.10. Act. 15.15. Ioh. 5.39.46.. But be∣cause these Original Tongues are not known to the People of God, who have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God, to read & search themIoh. 5.39., therefore they are to be tran∣slated
into the vulgar Language of every Nation unto which they come 1 Cor. 14.6, 9, 11, 12, 24, 27, 28., that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner Col. 3.16, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope Ro. 15.4.. IX. The infallible Rule of Inter∣pretation of Scripture, is the Scrip∣ture it self and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sence of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be search∣ed and known by other places that speak more clearly 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. Act. 19.15.19.. X The Supreame Judge, by which all Controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all decrees of Councils, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines of men, and pri∣vate Spirits, are to be examined; and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture Mat. 22.29.31. Eph. 2.10. Act. 28.25.. CHAP. II. Of God, and of the Holy Trinity. THere is but one only Deut. 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.4, 6., living, and true God 1 Tes. 1.9. Ier. 10.10; who is infinite in being and Perfection Iob. 11.7, 8, 9. Iob. 26.14., a most pure spirit Iob 4.24▪, invisible 1 Tim. 1.17,, without bo∣dy,
parts Deut. 4.15.16., or passions Act. 14.11., immutableIam. 1.17, immense 1 Ki. 8.27. eternal Ps. 143.3., incomprehen∣sible Ps. ▪43.3., Almighty Gen. 27.1, most wise Ro. 16.27., most holy Isa. .3., most free Ps. 115.3., most ab∣solute  3.4., working all things accord∣ing to the counsel of his own im∣mutable and most righteous wil Hb. 1.11., for his own glory ro. 16.4., most loving Ioh. 4, 16., gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truh, or∣giving iniquity, transgression▪ and sinExo. 34.7., the rewarder of them that dili∣gently seek him Heb. 11.6, and withall, ost just and terrible in his judgments Neh. 9.32.; hating all sin Ps. 5.5, 6., and who will by  means clear the guilty Nh. 1.2.. II. God hath all life Iob. 5.26., glory Act. 7.2., goodness Ps 119.68., blessedness 1 Tim. 6.15, in, and of himself, and is alone in and unto himself al-sufficient, not anding in need of any creatures which he hath made Act. 17.24, 25., nor deriving any glory from them I. 27.2., but only maifesting his own glory, in, by, unto, and upon them: He is the alone foun¦tain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all thing Rom. 11.6., and hath most Soveraign domini∣on over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever him∣self pleaseth . 4.11. Dan. 4.25.. In his sight all things
are open and manifest Heb. 4.13., his know∣ledge is infinite, infallible, and in∣dependant upon the CreatureRom. 11.33, 34. Psal. 147.5, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain Act. 14.18 Ezek. 11.5.. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his commands Ps. 145.17. Rom. 7.12.. To him is due from Angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience he is pleased to require of them Rev. 5.12, 13, 14.. III. In the Unity of the God-head, there be three persons, of one sub∣stance, power and eternity▪ God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost 1 Ioh. 5.7. Mat. 3.16, 17. Mat. 28.61 2 Cor. 13.4.. The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceed∣ing: The Son is eternally begot∣ten of the Father Joh. 1.14, 15.: the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Fa∣ther and the Son Joh. 15.26. Gal. 4.6.. CHAP. III. Of Gods Eternal Decree. GOD from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy Coun∣sel of his own will, freely, and un∣changeably odain whatsoever comes to pass Eph. 1.1. Rom 11.33 Heb. 6.17 Ro 9 15.18.; yet so, as thereby, nei∣ther is God the Author of sin Ia. 1.13 17.  Iob. 1.1., nor is violence offered to the will of the
Creatures, nor is the liberty or con∣tingency of second Causes taken a∣way, but rather established Act. 2.24. Mat. 17.12 Act. 4.27. Ioh. 19.11. Pro. 16.33.. II. Although God knows what∣soever may, or can come to pass up∣on all supposed conditionsAct. 15.18. Mat. 11.12 24., yet hath he not decreed any thing, because he fore-saw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions Rom. 9.11, 13, 16, 18.. By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and Angels1 Tim. 5.21. Mat. 25.41, are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death Rom 9.22, 23. Eph. 1.5, 6. Pro. 16.4.. IV. These Angels and men, thus predestinated and fore-ordained, are particularly, and unchangeably designed, and their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished 2 Tim. 2.19.. V. Those of mankind, that are predestinated unto Life, God, be∣fore the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal & im∣mutable purpose, & the secret coun∣sel and good pleasure of his Will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlast∣ing glory Eph. 1.4. Rom. 8.30. 2 Tim. 1.9. 1 Thes. 5.9., out of his meer free grace, & love without any foresight of Faith, or good works, or perseve¦rance
in either of them, or any other thing in the creature as conditions or causes moving him thereunto Ro. 9.11., and all to the Praise of his glorious grace Eph. 1.4. Eph. 1.6.. VI. As God hath appointed the Elect unto Glory, so hath he by the eternal and most free purpose of his Will, fore ordained all the means thereunto 1 Pet 1.2. Eph. 1.4, 5. Eph. 2.10. 2 Thes. 2.13.. Wherefore they who are Elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ1 Thes. 5.9, 10. Tit. 2.14., are effect∣ually called unto faith in Christ, by his Spirit working in due season, are justified, adopted, sanctified Rom. 8.10. Eph. 1.5. 2 Thes 5.18, and kept by his power through faith un∣to salvation 1 Pet. 1.5.. Neither any other re∣deemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified and saved, but the Elect onely Ioh. 17.9. Rom. 8.28. to the end. Ioh. 10.26. Ioh. 8.47.  Ioh. 2.19.. VII. The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearch∣able counsel of his own Wil, where∣by he extendeth, or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth, for the glory of his soveraign power over his crea∣tures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath, for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice Mat. 11.25, 26. Rom. 9.12.  im. 2.19. 1 Pet. 2.8.. VIII. The Doctrine of this high Mystery of Predestination is to be
handled with special prudence and care Ro. 9.22. Ro. 11.35. Deu. 29.29., that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedence thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual Vocation, be assured of their eter∣nal Election 2 Pet 1.10. So shall this Doct∣rine afford matter of praise, reve∣rence and admiration of God Eph. 1.6., and of humility, diligence and abundant consolation to all that sincerely obey the Gospel Ro. 11.5, 6, 20. 2 Pet. 1.10. Rom. 8.33. Luk. 10.20. CHAP. IV. Of Creation. IT pleased God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost Heb. 1.2. Ioh. 1.1, 2. Gen. 1.2. Iob. 26.13., for the mani∣festation of the glory of his eternal Power, Wisdom and Goodness Ro. 1.20. Ier. 10.12. Ps. 33.5, 6., in the beginning to create, or make of nothing the World, and all things therein, whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days and all ve∣ry good Gen. 1. Cap Heb. 11.5. Col. 1.16. Act. 17.2.. II. After God had made all other creatures, he created Man, male and female Gen. 1.27., with reasonable and im∣mortal souls Gen. 2.7. Luk. 23.24 Mat. 10.28, indued with know∣ledge, righteousness and tre holy∣ness; after his own Image Gen. 1.6. Col. 3.10. Eph. 4.24., having the Law of God written in their
heartsRom. 2.14, 15., and power to fulfil itEccl. 7.29., and yet under a possibility of transgres∣sing, being let to the liberty of their own will, which was subject unto change Gen. 3.6. Eccl. 7.23.. Beside this Law written in their hearts, they received a com∣mand, not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which whiles they kept, they were happy in their Communion with GodGen. 2.12. & 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 23., and had Dominion over the creatures Gen. 1.26, 28.. CHHP. V. Of Providence. GOD the great Creator of all things, doth uphold Heb. 1.3., direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, act∣tions, and thingsDan. 4.34. Ps. 135.6. Act 17 25.26, 28., from the greatest even to the least Mat. 10.29, 30, 31., by his most wise and holy Providence Pro. 15.3, according to his infallible fore-knowledge Act. 15.18, and the free and immutable counsel of his own Will Eph. 1.11. Psal. 33.10.11., to the praise of the glory of his Wisdom, Power, Ju∣stice, Goodness, and Mercy. II. Although in Relation to the fore-knowledge and decree of God,Isa. 63.14. Eph 3.10. Rom. 9.17. Gen. 45.7. Psa. 14 5.7. the first cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly Act. 2.23., yet, by the same Providence he or∣dereth them to fall out according to
the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely or contingently Gen. 8.22. Ier. 11.35. Ex. 22.13. with Deut. 19.5. Isa. 10.6, 7.. III. God in his ordinary Pro∣vidence maketh use of means Act. 27.3. Isa. 55.10.: yet is free to work without Hos. 1.7. Mat. 4.4., above Rom. 4.19, 20, 21., and against them at his pleasure 1 Kin. 6.6. Dan. 3.26.. IV. The Almighty power, unsearch∣able wisdom; and infinite goodness of God so far manifest themselve in his Providence, that it extendeth it self even to the first fall, and all other sins of Angels and men Rom. 11.31, 33, 34. 2 Sam. 24.1. 1 Chr. 10.4, 13, 14. 2 Sam. 19.10. Act. 2.23., and that not by a bare permission Act. 14.16., but such as hath joyned with it a most wise and powerful bounding Ps. 76.10. 2 Ki. 19.28, and otherwise ordering and governing of them, in a manifold dispensation, to his own holy ends Gen. 50.20 Isa. 10, 6.7.: yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth onely from the creature, and not from God who being most holy and righ∣teous, neither is, nor can be the Au∣thor or Approver of sin Iam. 1.13 14, 17. 1 Ioh▪ 2.16. Psal. 50, 21. V. The most wise, righteous and gracious God doth often times leave for a season his own children to ma∣nifold temptations, and the corrup∣tion of their own hearts to chastise them for their former sins, or to dis∣cover unto them the hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of
their hearts, that they may be hum∣bled 2 Cor. 12.25, 26, 31. 2 Sam. 24., and to raise them to a more close and constant dependance for their support upon himself, and to make them more watchfull against all future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends 1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9. Psal. 73. throughout. Psal. 77.1. to 12.. VI. As for those wicked and un∣godly men, whom God as a righte∣ous Judg for former sins doth blind and hardenRom. 1.24, 26, 28. Ro. 11.7, 8., from them he not on∣ly witholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been enlightned in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts Deu. 9.4., but some∣times also withdraweth the gifts which they had Mat. 13.12., & exposeth them to such objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin Deu. 2.30. 2 Reg. 8.12.; and with∣al, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the World, and the power of Satan Ps. 81.11.12. 2 Thes. 2.10, 11, 12., whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves even under those means which God useth for the softning of others Exod. 7.3. 2 Cor. 2.15. Isa. 8.14. 1 Pet. 2.7.8 Isa. 6.9, 14.. VII. As the providence of God doth in general reach to all crea∣tures; so after a special manner it taketh care of his Church, and dispo∣seth all things to the good thereof 1 Tim. 4.10. Rom. 8.28. Isa. 34.24..
CHAP. VI. Of the fall of Man, of Sin, and of the punishment thereof. OUr first parents being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, sinned in eating the for∣bidden fruit Gen. 3.13. 2 Cor. 2.3.. This their sin, God was pleased according to his wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purpos'd to order it to's own gloryRo. 11.3. II. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and commu∣nion with GodGen 3, 6, 7, and so became dead in sinGen. 2.17., and wholly defiled in all the faculties & parts of soul and body Tit. 1.15.. III. They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed Gen. 1.17. Act. 17.16. Rom. 3.12, 15, 16, 17., and the same death in sin and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation Ps. 51.5. Gen. 5.3. Iob. 14.4.. IV. From this original corrupti∣on, whereby we are utterly indispo∣sed, disabled, and made opposite to all good Rom. 5.6. Rom. 8.7. Col. 1.21., and wholly inclined to all evil Gen. 6.5. Gen. 8.21. Rom. 3.10.11, 12., do proceed all actual trans∣gressions Iam. 1.14, 15. Ep. 2.2, 3. Mat. 15.19.. V. This corruption of nature du∣ring this life, doth remain in those that are regenerated 1 Ioh. 1.8. Iam. 3.2. Prov. 20.9. Eccl. 7.20., and although
it be, Through Christ, pardoned & mortified, yet both it self, and all the motions thereof are truly and pro∣perly sin Rom. 7.5, 7, 8, 25. Gal. 5.17.. VI. Every sn, both original and Actual, being a transgression of the righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto 1 Ioh 3.4., doth in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinnerRo, 2.15. & 3.9, 19., where∣by he is bound over to the wrath of God Eph 2 3, and curse of the Law Gal. 3.1., and so made subject to death Rom. 6▪13., with all miseries spiritual Eph. 4.16., temporal Rom 8.20. Lam. 3.39., and eternal Ma. 25.41 2 Thes. 1.9.. CHAP. VII. Of Gods Covenant with man. THe distance between God and the creature is so great, that al∣though reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their creator yet they could never have any frui∣tion of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary con∣descension on Gods part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of Covenant Isa. 40.13.14, 15, 16, 17. Job. 9.32. 1 Sam. 2.25 Ps. 100.2, 3. Iob. 22.2, 3 Luk. 17.10 Act. 17.24, 25.. II. The first Covenant made with Man, was a covenant of Works Gal. 3.12., wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity Rom. 10.5. Rom 5.12. to 20., upon
condition of perfect and personal o∣bedience 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3.4. Heb. 11.13. Ioh. 8.56 l. III. Man by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that co∣venant, the Lord was pleas'd to make a Second Gal. 3.7, 8, 9, 14., commonly called the Covenant of Grace: Wherein he freely offereth unto sinners, Life, & Salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him that they may be saved Col. 2.17., and promising to give un∣to all those that are ordained unto Life, his holy Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe Mat. 28.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23 24, 25.. IV. This Covenant of Grace is frequently set forth in the Scripture by the Name of a Testament, in re∣ference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator,Heb. 12.22. to 28. Ier. 31.33. and to the everlasting Inheritance, with all things belong∣ing to it, therein bequeathed Mat. 28.29. Eph. 2.15.16, 17, 18,. V. This Covenant was differently administred in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Gospel Lu. 12.10.. Under the Law, it was administred by Promises, Prophecies, Sacrifices, Circumcision, the Paschal Lamb, and other Types and Ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come Oal. 3.14. Act. 5.1. Rom' 3.2, 1.23, 28, 30. Psal. 31.1. Heb. 13▪8.▪ which were for that time
sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the spirit to instruct and build up the Elect in Faith in the promised Messiah 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 11.13. Ioh. 8.56., by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal Salvation; and is called, the Old Testament Gal. 3.7.8, 9, 14.. VI. Under the Gospel, when Christ the substance Col. 2.17., was exhibited, the Ordinances in which this Covenant is dispensed, are the preaching of the Word, & the administration of the Sacrament of Baptisme, and the Lords SupperMat. 28.19.20. 1 Cor. 11.23.24.25.. Which though fewer in number, and administred with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in them it is held forth in more fulness, evidence and spiritual efficacy Heb. 12.22. to 28. Ier. 31.33., to all Nations both Jews and Gentiles Mat. 28.19. Eph. 2.15, 16, 17, 18.; and is called the New Testament Lu. 12.10.. There are not therefore two Covenants of Grace, differing in substance, but one & the same, under various dispensations Gal. 3.14. Act. 5.1. Rom. 3.21, 23, 28, 30. Psal. 31.1. Heb. 12.8.. CHAP. VIII. Of Christ the Mediator. IT pleased God, in his eternal purpose to chuse and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God
and Man Isa. 42.1. 1 Pet. 1.19. Joh. 3.16. 1 Tim. 2.5., the Prophet Act. 3.22., Priest Heb. 5.5., and King Ps. 2.6. Luk. 1.33., the Head, and Saviour of his ChurchEph. 5.13., the heir of all things Heb. 1.2., and Judge of the World Act. 17.1.: Unto whom he did from all eternity give a people to be his seedIoh. 17.6. Ps. 21.30. Isa. 53.10., and to be by him in time Redeemed, Called, Justified, Sanctified and Glorified 1 Tim. 2.6. Isa. 55.4, 5. 1 Cor. 1.30.. II. The Son of God, the second Person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father; did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him mans nature Ioh. 1.1. 1 Joh. 5.20. Phil. 2.6., with all the essential properties, and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin Heb. 2.14. & 4.15.: being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her substance Luk. 1.27.31, 35.

Rom. 9.5. 1 Tim. 3.26.. Which per∣son is very God, and very Man, yet one Christ the only Mediator between God and man Ro. 1.2, 4.. III. The Lord Jesus, in his hu∣mane nature, thus united to the di∣vine, was sanctified and anointed
with the holy spirit above measureIsa. 42.1. 1 Pet. 1.19. Iob. 3.16. 1 Tim. 2.5., having in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge Act. 3.22.: in whom, it pleased the Father, that all fulness should dwellHeb. 5.5., to the end, that be∣ing holy, harmless, undefiled and full of grace and truth Psal. 2.6. Luk. 1.33., he might be thorowly furnished to execute the Office of a Mediator, and Surety Eph. 5.13.: which Office he took not unto him∣self, but was thereunto called y his FatherHeb. 1.2., who put all power & judg∣ment into his hand, & gave him com∣mandment to execute the same Act. 17.1. IV. This Office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake Iob. 17.6▪ Psal. 21.30 Isa. 53.10., which that he might discharge, he was made under the Law 1 Tim. 2.6. Isa. 55.4.5, 1 Cor. 1.30., and did perfectly fulfill it Ioh. 1.1. 1 Ioh. 5, 20., endured most grievous torments immediately in his soul Pil. 2.6., and most painful sufferings in his body Heb 2.14. & 4.15.; was crucified and died Luk. 1.27 31, 35.

Heb, 9.12▪ 13.. VI. Although the work of Re∣demption was not actually wrought by Christ till after his Incarnation, yet the vertue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were communicated unto the elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the World, in, and by those promises, types, and sacri∣fices, wherein he was revealed, and signified to be the seed of the Wo∣man, which should bruise the Ser∣pents head; and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World; being yesterday and to day the same, and for ever Gal. 4, 4, 5. Gen. 3.15. Rev. 13.8.. VII. Christ, in the work of Medi∣ation, acteth according to both Na∣tures, by each Nature doing that which is proper to it self Heb. 9.14 1 Pet. 3.18▪, yet by reason of the unity of the Person,
that which is proper to one nature▪ is some times in Scripture attribu∣ted to the Person denominated by the other Nature Act▪ 20.28 Jo. 3 13. 1 Jo. 3.16. VIII. To all those for whom Christ hath purchased▪ redemption, he doth certainly, and effectually apply and communicate the sameJo. 6.37., making in∣tercession for them  Jo. 2.1. Rom. 8.14., and revealing unto them, in and by the word, the Mysteries of Salvation Jo. 15.13 ph. 1.7, 8. Joh. 17.6., effectually perswading them by his spirit to be∣lieve, and obey, and governing their hearts by his word and spirit Joh. 14.16. Heb. 12.2. 2 Cor. 4.3. o. 8.9, 14. & 15.18.19 oh. 17, 17., overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty Power and Wisdom in such manner, and wayes, as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation Ps. 110.1.  Cor. 15.15. Mal. 4.2, 3. Col. 2.15.. CHAP. IX. Of Free Will. GOD hath indued the Will of Man with that natural liberty that is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of Nature deter∣mined to do good or evil Mat. 17.12 Jam. 1.14. Dt. 30.15. II. Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power, to will, and to do, that which was good, & well-pleasing to God Ecol. 7.29 Gen. 1.26.; but yet, muta∣bly,
so that he might fall from it Gen. 2.16. & 3.6.. III. Man by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of Will to any spiritual good accom∣panying salvation Rom. 5.6. and 8.7. Joh. 15.5.; so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good Re. 3.10.11., and dead in sin Eph. 2 1.5. Col. 3.13., is not able, by his own strength, to con∣vert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto Joh. 6.44. 1 Cor. 2.14. Tit. 2.3.4.. IV. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace; he freeth him from his natu∣ral bondage under sin Col. 1.13. Jo. 8.31.36.; and by his grace, inables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually goodPhil. 2.13. Ro. 6.18.22 yet so, as by reason of his remain∣ing corruption, he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil Gal. 5.17. Rom. 1.15.18, 19, 21.. V. The will of man is made per∣ectly and immutably free to good alone in the state of Glory only Eph. 4.12. Heb. 11.13. Jude v. 24.. CHAP. X. Of effectual calling. ALL those whom God hath pre∣destinated unto life, and those only he is pleased in his appointed & accepted time, effectually to call Ro. 8.30. & 11.7. Eph. 10.21., by his word and Spirit 2 Thes. 1.13, 14. 2 Cor. 3.36., out of that
state of sin and death, in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ Rom 8.2. Eph. 2.1, 5. 2 Tim. 1.9., in lightning their minds spiritually and savingly to un∣derstand the things of God Act. 26.18. Eph. 1.17.18.; taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh; renew∣ing their wills, and by his Almighty power determining them to that which is good Ezek. 11.19. Phil. 2.13. Deut. 30.6.,Ezek 36.26. & effectually draw∣ing them to Jesus Christ Eph. 1.19; yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace Cant. 1.4. Ioh 6.37.. II. This effectual Call is of Gods free, and special grace alone, not from any thing at all foreseen in man 2 Tim. 1.9. Tit. 3.4.5.8.9., who is altogether passive therein, until being quickened & re∣newed by the holy Spirit 1 Cor. 2.1.4. Rom. 8.7. Eph. 2.5., he is thereby inabled to answer this Call, and to imbrace the grace offered, and conveyed in it Ioh 6.37.. III. Elect infants dying in Infancy are regenerated, and saved by Christ through the Spirit Luk. 18.15.16. Ioh. 3.3, 5., who worketh when where and how he pleaseth Ioh. 3.8.: So also are all other elect Persons, who are uncapable of being out∣wardly called by the Word 1 Ioh. 5.12. Act. 4.12.. IV. Others, not elected, though they may be called by the Ministry
of the Word Mat. 22.14., and may have some common operations of the Spirit, Mat. 7.22 Heb. 6.4 5. yet they never truely come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be sa∣ved Ioh. 6.64.65, 66. and 8.24.: much less can men, not pro∣fessing the Christian Religion, be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of Nature, and the Law of that Religi∣on they do profess Act. 1 12. Ioh. 14 6. Eph 2.12. Ioh. 4.22.. And, to assert and maintain, that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested 2 Ioh. v. 9, 10, 11. Gal. 1.6.78. CHAP. XI. Of Iustification, THose whom GOD effectually calleth he also freely justifieth Ro. 8.30. and 3, 24. not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, & by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous: not, for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christs sake alone: nor, by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, nor any other evange∣lical obedience, to them as their righteousness; but, by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them Rom. 4 5.9, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.19. Rom. 3.22.24, 25, 26. Tit. 3 5.7. Eph. 1.7. Ier. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30. Rom. 5.17.18, 19., they receiving and rest∣ing on him and his righteousness by
faith, which faith they have, not of themselves, it is the gift of God Act. 10.44. Phi. 3.5. Act. 13.3, 39.. II Faith, thus receiving and rest∣ing on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justifica∣tion John 1.12. Rom. 3.18.; yet is it not alone in the per∣son justified, but is ever accompani∣ed with all other saving graces, & is no dead faith but worketh by loveam. 2.17. Gal. 5.6.. III. Christ by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real, and full sa∣tisfaction to his Fathers Justice in their behalf Rom. 5.8. 1 Tim. 2.5. Heb. 10.10. Isa. 53.4, 5, 6, 10, 11.. Yet in as much as he was given by the Father for themRom. 8.32., and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead hand, both freely, not for any thing in them, their justification is only of free grace Rom 3.24,Mat. 3.17 that, both the exact justice, & rich grace of God, might be glori∣fied in the justification of sinners Ro. 3.26.. IV. God did from all eternity, de∣cree to justifie all the elect Gal. 3.8. Rom. 8.30., and Christ did, in the fulness of time, die fr their sins, and rise again for their justification Gal. 4.4. Rom .25.: nevertheless they are not justified, untill the holy spirit doth in due time, actually ap∣ply Christ unto them Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7..
V. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified Mat. 6.12. 1 Joh. 2.1.2.: and, although they can never fall from the state of justificationLuk, 22.32,  Joh. 10, 8.; yet, they may by their sins, fall under Gods fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they hum∣ble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their Faith and Repentance Psal. 8.31, 32, 33. Mat. 26.75. VI. The justification of Believers under the Old Testament, was, in all these respects, one and the same, with the justification of Believers under the New Testament Gal. 3.9, 13, 14.. CHAP. XII. Of Adoption. ALl those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in, and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of Adoption Eph. 1.5. Gal. 4 4, 5.: by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and priviledges of the children of God Rom. 8.17. Jer. 14.9. Rev. 3.12., have his Name put upon them c, receive the spirit of Adoption Rom. 8.15., have access to the throne of grace with boldnessEph. 3.12., are inabled to cry Abba, Father Gal. 4.6., are pitied Ps. 103.13., protected Prov. 14.26., provided
for Mat. 6.30 1. Pet. 5 7., and chastned by him, as by a Father Heb. 12.6: yet never cast off Lam. 3.31, but sealed to the day of redemption Eph 4 30, and inherit the promises Heb. 6.12, as heirs of everlasting Salvation 1 Pet. 1.3.4 Heb. 1.14.. CHAP. XIII. Of Sanctification. THey who are effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart, & a new spirit created in them are further sanctified really & per∣sonally, through the vertue of Christs death & resurrection 1 Cor. 6.11 Act. 20.32., by his word and spirit dwelling in them Ioh. 17.17 Eph. 5.26.: the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed Rom. 6.6., and the several lusts thereof are more & more weakned and mortified Gal. 5.14. Rom, 8.13., and they, more and more quickned and strengthned in all saving graces Col. 1.12.,2 Cor 7.1. Heb. 12.12. to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. II. This sanctification is through∣out, in the whole man 1 Thes. 5.23.: yet imper∣fect in this life, there abideth still some remnants of corruption in eve∣ry part 1 Ioh. 1 10 Rom. 7 18.23. Phil. 3.12.: whence ariseth a continual and irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh Gal. 5.17. 1 Pet. 2 11..
III. In which war, although the remaining corruption, for a time, may much prevail Ro. 7.23.: yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part doth overcome Ro. 6.14.: & so the Saints grow in grace 2 Pet. 3.18., per∣fecting holiness in the fear of God2 Cor. 7.1.. CHAP. XIV. Of saving Faith. THe grace of Faith, whereby the Elect are inabled to believe to the saving of their Souls Heb. 10.39., is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts2 Cor. 4.13., & is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the Word Rom. 10.14, 17., by which also, and by the administrati∣on of the Sacraments, and Prayer, it is increased and strengthned 1 Pet. 2.2 Rom. 4.1.. II. By this Faith, a Christian be∣lieveth to be true, whatsoever is re∣vealed in the word, for the authori∣ty of God himself speaking therein Ioh. 4.42. 2 Thes. 3.13▪ and acteth differently upon that which each particular passage there∣of containeth, yielding obedience to the Commands Rom. 16.26.; trembling at the threatnings Heb. 11.13.,Isa. 66.2. and imbracing the pro∣mises of God for this life, and that which is to come Heb. 11.13.. But the princi¦pal
acts of saving faith, are Accep∣ting, Receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for Justification, Sanct∣ification, and Eternal life; by ver∣tue of the Covenant of grace Ioh. 1.11. Act. 6.32 Act. 15.11.. III. This faith is different in de∣grees, weak, or strong Heb. 5.13: may be of∣ten and many waies assailed, and weakned, but gets the victory Luke 22.31. Eph. 6.16.: gro∣wing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ Heb 6.11.12. Heb. 10.22. Col. 2.2., who is both the Author and finisher of our Faith Heb. 12.2.. CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto life. REpentance unto life, is an Evan∣gelical grace Zech. 12.0. Act 11.18, the doctrine whereof is to be Preached by every Minister of the Gospel, as well as that of Faith in Christ Luk. 24.47. Mat. 1.5.. II. By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature, and righteous Law of God: and, upon the apprehension of his mercy in Christ to such as are peni∣tent, so grieves for, & hates his sin, as to turn from them all unto God Ezek 18.30, 31. Ia. 30.22. Psal. 51.4▪ Pa. 119.128., purposing & endeavoring to walk
with him in all the waies of his Commandments Psa. 119.6.59.105. Luk. 1.6▪ 2 Kings. 23.15.. III. Although Repentance be not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for sin, or any cause of the pardon there∣of Ezek. 36.31, 32. Ezek. 16.61.62, 63., which is the act of Gods free grace in Christ Hos. 14.24. Rom. 3.24., yet is it of such ne∣cessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon without it Luk. 13.3.5. Act. 17.50, 51.. IV. As there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation Rom. 6.23. Mat. 22.36; so there is no sin so great, that it can bring dam¦nation on those who truly repentIsa. 1.16.18.. V. Men ought not to content them∣selves with a general repentance, but it is every mans duty to endeavour to repent of his particular sins, par∣ticularly Ps. 19.13. Luk▪ 9.8.. VI. As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God, praying for the pardon thereofPs. 51.4. upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy Prov. 28.13. 1 Joh. 1.9.: so he that scandalizeth his brother, or the Church of Christ, ought to be wil∣ling by a private or publick confess∣on▪ and sorrow for his sin to declare his repentance to thse that are of∣fended Jam 5.16. Luk 17 3. Joh. 7.19. Psal 51. , who are thereupon to be reconed to him, and in love to receive him. .
CHAP. XVI. Of good Woorks. GOod Works are onely such as God hath commanded in his holy Word Mic. 6.8 Rom. 12.2. Heb. 13.21., and not such as with∣out the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intention Mat. 15.9. Isa. 29.13. 1 Pet. 1.18. Rom. 10.2. Ioh. 16.2.. II. These good works done in o∣bedience to Gods Commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively faith Iam. 2.18 22.: and by them, Be∣lievers manifest their thankfulnessPsal. 116.12, 13. 1 Pet. 2.9.: strengthen their assurance 1 Iob. 2.3., edifie their Brethren 2 Cor. 6.2. Mat. 5.16., adorn the profession of the Gospel Tit. 2.5, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Tim. 6.1., stop the mouths of the adversaries 1 Pet. 2.15., and glorifie God 1 Pet. 2.22. Ioh. 15.8., whose workmanship they are, creat∣ed in Christ Jesus thereunto Eph. 2.10.: that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life Rom. 6.22. III. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ Ioh. 15.4 Ezek. 16.26, 27.. And that they may be inabled there∣unto, besides the graces they have al∣ready received, there is required an actual influence of the same holy Spirit, to work in them to will and to do, of his good pleasure Phil. 2.13  Cor. 3.5.: yet are
they not hereupon to grow negli∣gent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a spe∣cial motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them Phil. 2.12 Heb. 6.11.12. Isa. 64.7. 2 Tim. 26.6. Iude v. 20.21.. IV. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest hight, which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in du∣ty they are bound to doLuke. 17.10. Neh. 13.22. Ioh. 9.2.7. Gal. 4.17.. V. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come; & the infinite distance that is between us & God, whom, by them, we can nei∣ther profit, not satisfie for the debt of our former sins Ro. 3.20. Eph. 2.8.9. Psal. 16.2. Iob. 35 78, but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants Luk. 17.10., and because, as they are good they proceed from his spiritGal. 5.22.: and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much weakness & imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of Gods judgment Isa. 64.6. Gal. 5.17. Rom. 7.15.18..
VI. Yet notwithstanding the Per∣sons of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works al∣so are accepted in him Eph. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5. Gen. 4.4. Heb. 11, 4., not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in Gods sight Job. 9.20., but that, he looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward that which is sin∣cere, though accompanied with ma∣ny weaknesses and imperfections Heb. 13.20, 21. 2 Cor. 8 12. Heb. 6.10. Mat. 15.21 23.. VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the mater of them they may be things which God com∣mands, and of good use, both to themselves and others 2 Kings 10.30, 31. Phil. 1.15.16, 18., yet because they proceed not from an heart pu∣rified by faith Gen. 4.9. Heb. 11.4▪, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word 1 Cor. 13 3, Isa. 12., nor to a right end, the glory of God Mat. 6.3., they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make a man meet to receive grace from God Hag. 2.14. Tit. 1.15. Amos 5.21.22 Hos. .4.. And yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing unto God Ps. 14.4. Job. 21.14, 15. Mat. 25.41.. CHAP. XVII. Of Perseverance. THey whom God hath accepted in his eloved, effectually cal∣led, ad sanctified by hi Spirit, can
neither toally nor finally; fall away from the state of grace: but shall certainly persevere herein to the end, and be eternally saved Phi. 1.6. 2 Pet. 1.10. 1 Ioh. 2.9. 1 Pet. 1.5.. II. This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free will, but upon the immutability of the decree of election, flowing from the free & unchngeable love of God the Father 2 Tim. 2.18, 19. Ier. 31.3., upon the eficacy of the merit and inercession of Jesus Chri Heb. 10.10, 11. Heb. 9.12, 13.14, 15. Luk. 12.32▪ the abiding of the spirit, & of the seed of God within them Ioh. 4.16 John 2▪27., and the nature of the Covenant of Grace Jer. 32.40.: from all which ariseth also the certainty & infalliility thereofJoh. 10.28 1 Joh. 2.19.. III. Nevertheless, they may through the temptations of atan & of the world, the prevalency of cor∣ruption remaining in them; and the neglect of the means of their preser∣vation, fall into grievous sins Mat. 26.70, 71, 74., and for a time continue thereinPsal. 51.14▪, where∣by they incur Gods displeasureIsa. 64.5., and grieve his holy spirit Eph. 4.30., come to be dprived of some measure of their graces and comforts Psal. 51.8., have their hearts hardened Isa. 53.17., and their con∣sciences wounded Ps. 37.3.4, hurt, and scan∣dalize others Sam. 12.14., and bring temporal judgments upon themselves Ps. 89▪ 31.32..
CHAP. XVIII. Of the assurance of Grace and Salvation. ALthough hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favour of God, and estate of Sal∣vation Iob. 8.13 14. Mic. 3.11. Deut. 29.19, which hope of theirs shall perish Mat. 7.22 Act. 26.6.23.: yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in since∣rity, endeavouring to walk in all good conscience before him, may in this life be certainly assured that they are in the state of grace 1 Ioh. 2.3 1 Ioh. 5.13, and may re∣joyce in the hope of the glory of god which hope shall never make them ashamed Rom. 5.2, 5.. II. This certainty is not a bare con∣jectural and probable perswasion, grounded upon a fallible hope Heb. 6.11.19., but an infallible assurance of faith, foun∣ded upon the divine truth of the pro∣mises of salvation Heb. 6.17.18., the inward evi∣dence of those graces unto which these promises are made1 Pet. 1.4.5, 10, 11. 1 Iob. 2.3. 2 Cor, 1.12., the testi∣mony of the spirit o adoption wit∣nessing with ou spirits that we are the children of God Rom. 8.15: which spirit is the earnest of inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of redemp∣tion Eph. 3.13..
III. This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith but that a true believer may wait long and conflict with many diffi∣culties before he be partaker of itIoh, 5.13 Isa. 30, 10. Mark 9.24. Psal. 77. to ver. 12.: yea, being enabled by the spirit to know the things which are freely gi∣ven him of God, he may, without ex∣traordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means, attain there∣unto 1 Cor. 2.12 1 Ioh. 4.13 Heb. 6.11. Eph. 3.17.18▪ 19.. And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure2 Pet. 1.10., that thereby his heart may be enlar∣ged in peace & joy in the holy Ghost, in love & thankfulness to God, & in strength and chearfulness in the du∣ties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance Rom. 5.1, 2, 5 Rom. 14.17. Ephes. 1.3, 4 Psal. 4.6.7.; so far is it from inclining men to looseness 1 Ioh. 2.1. Rom. 6.1, 2. 2 Cor. 7.1. Ro. 8.1.12. 1 Ioh. 1.2.3 Psal. 10.4 1 Ioh. 1.6.7. IV. True believers may have the assurance of their Salvation divers ways shaken, diminished, and inter∣mitted, as by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the conscience, & grieveth the spirit, by some sudden or vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the light of his counte∣nance, & suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness, and to have
no lightCant. 5.2.3, 6. Psal. 51.8, 12, 13. Eph. 4.30. Psal. 77.1. Mat. 26.69 Isa. 50.10. Psal. 31.22 Psalm. 88. throughout.: yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, & life of faith, that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart, and conscience of duty, out of which by the operation of the spiri, this assu∣rance may in due time be revived Joh. 3.9.

GOD gave to Adam a Law, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him, & all his posterity to personal, entire, exact and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatned death upon the breach of it: and indued him with power and ability to keep it Gen. 1.16 Gen. 2.17. Ro. 2.14.15 & 10.5. Gal. 3.10. Eccl. 7.9. Job. 28.28.. II. This Law, after his fall conti∣nued to be a perfect rule of righte∣ousness, & as such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten Com∣mandments, and written in two Tables Jam. 1.25▪ & 2.8.1, 11. Ro. 13.8, 6. Deut. 5.32. & 0.4. Exod. 34.1, the four first Command∣ments containing our duty towards God, and the other six, our duty to man Mat. 22.37, 33, 39, 40..
III. Beside this Law commonly called Moral, God was pleased to give to the people of Isael, as a Church under age, Ceremonial Laws, con∣taining several typical Ordiances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ his graces, actions, suffering, and benefits Heb. 9. Chap. Heb. 10.1. Col. 2.17., and partly holdng forth divers instructions of Moral duties 1 Cor. 5▪2.. All which Ceremonial Laws are now abrogated under the new Te∣stament Col. 2.14.16, 17. Dan. 9.27. Eph. 1.15, 16. IV. To them also, as a body Po∣litic, he gave sundry Judicial Laws, which expired together with the state of that people, not obligeing a∣ny other now, further than the gene∣ral equity thereof may require Exod. 21. Chap. Exod. 22, to 29. 1 Pet. 2.3, 14. Mat. 5.17.. V. The Moral Law doth for e∣ver bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereofRom. 13.8.9, 10., and that, not only in regard of the atter contained in it, but also in re∣spect of the Authority of God the Creator who gave it Iam 2.10.1.. Neither doth Christ in the Gospel any way dis∣solve but much strengthen this ob∣ligation Mat. 5.17 18.19. Jam. 2.8. Rom. 3.31.. VI. Although true believer▪ be not under the Law, as a Covenant of works, to be thereby justified, or
condemned Rom. 6.14. Gal. 2.16. and 4, .5. Act. 13.9. Rom. 8.1., yet it is of great use to them, as well as to others, in that, as a rule of life informing the of the will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk according∣ly Rom. 7.21, 22, 25. Psal. 119.4 5, 6. 1 Cor. 17.19, discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts and lives Rom. 7.7.: so as examining them∣selves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, humliation for, and hatred against sin Iam. 1.23 Rom. 7.9.: together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience Gal. 3.2. Rom. 8.3, 4.. It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their corruptions: in that it forbids sin Iam. 2.11 Psal. 119.101, 104.: and the threatnings of it serve to shew, what even their sins deserve: and what afflictions in this life, they may expect for them, although freed from the curse there∣of threatned in the Law Ezra 9.13, 14. Psal. 89.30 31, 32, 33.. The pro∣mises of it in like manner, shew them Gods approbation of obedience, & what blessings they may expect upon the performance there of Lev. 26.1. to 14. with 2 Cor. 6.10. Eph. 9.2, 3. Psal. 19.11: although not as due to them by the Law, as a Covenant of Works Gal. 2.16. Luk. 17.12.. So as a mans doing good, and refraining from evil, because the Law encourageth to the one, & deterreth from the other,
is no evidence of his being under the Law, and not under grace Rom. 6 12 1 Pet. 3, 8.9, 10, 12. Heb. 12.28. VII. Neither are the fore mentio∣ned uses of the Law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with itGal. 3.21, the spirit of Christ subduing, and inabling the will of man, to do that freely and chearful∣ly, which the will of God revealed in the Law, requireth to be doneEzek. 36.27. Heb. 8.10., CHAP. XX. Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience. THe Liberty which Christ hath purchased for Believers, under the gospel, consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condem∣ning wrath of God, the curse of the Moral Law Tit. 2.11. Gal. 3.13., and in their being de∣livered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin Gal. 1.4. Rom. 6.14.; from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the Victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation Rom. 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.54 55, 56, 57., as also, in their free access to God Ro. 5.1, 2., and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a Child like love and willing mind Ro. 8.14. 1 Ioh. 4.18. All which were common also to Believers under the Law. But un∣der
the new Testament, the liberty of Christians is further inlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, to which the Jew∣ish Church was subject g, and in greater boldness of access to the Throne of Grace h, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the Law, did ordinarily partake of Job. 7.58, 59. 2 Cor. 3.13.17, 18.. II. God alone is Lord of the con∣science Jam. 4.12 Rom. 14.4.: and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in any thing con∣trary to his word, or beside it, in matters of Faith or Worship Act. 4.19 Act. 5.29. Mat. 13.8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 1.24. Mat. 15.9.. So that to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such commands out of con∣science, is to betray true liberty of conscience Col. 2.20.22, 23. Gal. 1.10. & 2.4, 5. & 5.1., & the requiring of an implicite. Faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is, to destroy liber∣ty of conscience, and reason also Ro. 10.17 Isa. 4.20. Act. 17.11 Joh. 4.21. Hos. 5.11. Rev. 5.11.16, 17. Jer. 8.9.. III. They, who upon pretence of Christian Liberty, do practice any sin, or cherish any Lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liber∣ty, which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before
him all the daies of our life Gal. 1.13· 1 Pet. 2.16 2 Pet. 2.19. Job. 8.34. Luk. 1.74.. IV. And because the power which God hath ordained, and the liberty which Christ hath purchased, are not intended by God, to destroy, but mutually to uphold & preserve one another: They, who upon pretence of Christian liberty shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be Civil or Ecclesi∣astical, resist the ordinance of God Ma. 12.29. 1 Pet. 2.13.14, 16. Rom. 13.1. to 8. Heb. 13.17.. And, for their publishing of such practices, as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning Faith, Worship, or Conversation: or, to the power of Godliness: or such erroneous Opinions or Practices, as either in their own nature, or in the manner of publishing or maintain∣ing them, are destructive to the ex∣ternal peace and order which Christ hath established in the Church, they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by the Cen∣sures of the Church Ro. 1.30. 1 Cor. 5.1, 5, 11.13. 2 Joh. 10.11 2 Thes. 3.14 Tit. 1.10, 11, 12, & 3.12 Mat. 18.15, 16, 17.

CHAP. XXI. Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath day. THe light of Nature sheweth that there is a God, who hath Lord∣ship & sovereignty over all, is good▪ & doth good unto all, & is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in and served with all the heart, and with all the soul, and with all the might Rom. 1.20 Psal. 119.68. Ier. 10.7. Psal, 18.3. Mark. 12.33.. But, the accep∣table way of worshiping the true God, is instituted by himself, and so limited to his own revealed Will▪ that he may not be worshipped ac∣cording to the imaginations & de∣vices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representa∣tions, or any other way not prescri∣bed in the holy Scripture Deut. 12.32. Mat. 15.9. Act. 17.25. Mat. 4.9.. II. Religious Worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son and holy Ghost; and to him alone Mat. 4.10; not to Angels, Saints, or any other Creature Col. 2.18. Rev. 19.10., and since the Fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the mediation of any other, but of Christ alone Ioh. 4.6. 1 Tim. 2.5. Eph. 2.8.. III. Prayer with Thanks-giving being one special part of Religious
Worship Phil. 4.6., is by God required of all men Psal. 65.2: and that it may be accepted it is to be made in the name of the Son Ioh. 13.14, by the help of his Spirit Rom. 8.16., ac∣cording to his will 1 Ioh. 5.14: with under∣standing, reverence, humility, fer∣vency, faith, love,Ps. 47.7. and perseverance and if vocal, in a known tongue 1 Cor. 14.. IV. Prayer is to be made for all things lawful 1 Ioh. 5.14. Ioh. 17.20., and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live here∣after o: but not for the dead2 Sam. 12.21, 23. Rev. 13.12, nor for those of whom it it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto death 1 Ioh. 5.16.. V. The reading of the Scriptures with Godly fearAct. 15.21., the sound Preach∣ing 1 Tit. 4.2., and conscionable hearing of the Word; in obedience unto God, with understanding, faith, and re∣verence Mat 3.1.19.: singing of Psalms with grace in the heart Col. 3.16. Iam. 5.13. Eph. 5.19.: as also the due administration, and worthy receiv∣ing of the Sacraments instituted by Christ; are all parts of the ordinary Religious Worship of God Mat. 28.19.; be∣sides religious OathsDeu. 6.63 Mat. 9.18., VowsIsa. 19.21. Eccles. 5.4, 5., Sol∣lemn Fasting Ioel. 2.12. Esther. 4.16. 1 Cor. 7.5., and Thanksgivings upon several occasions Ps. 107. throughout. Esther. 9.2, which are
in their several times and seasons, to be used in an holy and religious manner Heb. 12.28. VI. Neither Prayer nor any o∣ther part of Religious Worship, is now under the Gospel, either tyed unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed or towards which it is directed Ioh. 4.21: but GOD is to be worshipped every where Mal. 1.11 1 Tim. 2.8., in Spirit and truth Ioh. 4.23.: as in private Families Ier. 10.25 Ioh. 1▪., daily Mat. 6.11, and in secret, each one to himself Mat. 6.6.; so more solemnly in the publick As∣semblies, which are not carelesly or wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken when God, by his word or provi∣dence calleth thereunto sa. 16.6. Heb. 10.2. Pov. 8.34. Act. 13.42▪. VII. As it is of the Law of Na∣ture, that, in general, a due propor∣tion of time be set apart, for the Worship of God: so in his word, by a positive, moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all Ages, he hath particularly ap∣pointed one day in seven for a Sab∣bath to be kept holy unto him Exod. 20 8, 10, 11. Isa. 56.1, 4.: which from the beginning of the World to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and from the resurrection of Christ, was
changed▪ into the first day of the Week Gen. 2.2▪ 3, which in Scripture is cal∣led the Lords Day Rev. 1.10., and is to be continued to the end of the World, as the Christian Sabbath Exod. 20.8, 10. Mat· 5.17.. VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, af∣ter a due preparing of their hearts and ordering of their common af∣fairs beforehand, do not only ob∣serve an holy rest all the day, from their own works, words & thoughts about their worldly imployments▪ and recreations Exod. 20.8. Exod. 3.15, 16, 17. Isa. 58.13. Nehem. 13.15. to 22., but also are taken up the whole time in the publick and private exercises of his Wor∣ship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy Isa. 58.13. CHAP. XXII. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows. A Lawful Oath is a part of re∣ligious Worship Dut. 10.20., wherein, up∣on just occasion, the person swear∣ing, solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth; and to judge him according to the truth or falshood of what he sweareth Ex. 20.7: 2 Cor. 1.23. 2 Chron. 6.22, 23.. II. The Name of God only, is that by which men ought to swear, & therein it is to be used with all holy
fear and reverence eut. 6.13. Therefore to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glo∣rious and dreadful Name; or, to swear at all, by any other thing, is sinful and to be abhorred Exod. 30.7. Ier. 5.7. Mat. 5.34.. Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an Oath is warranted by the word of God, under the New Testament as well as under the Old Heb 6.16.; so a law∣ful Oath, being imposed by lawful Authority, in such matters ought to be taken 1 King. 8.31.. III. Whosoever taketh an Oath, ought duly to consider the weighti∣ness of so solemn an act, and there∣in to avouch nothing, but what he is fully perswaded is the Truth Exod. 20.7. Ier. 4.2., Neither may any man▪ bind him∣self by Oath to any thing but what is good and just, and what he be∣lieveth so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform Gen 24.2. to 9.. Yet it is a sin, to refuse an Oath touching any thing that is good and just, being imposed by lawful Authority Num. 5.1.9. IV. An Oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words without equivocation, or mental reservation Ier. 4.2. Psal. 24.14.: It cannot oblige to sin; but, in any thing not sinful, being taken, it binds to per∣formance,
although to a mans own hart 1 Sam 25.32, 33, 34.. Nor is it to be vioated, al∣though made to Hereticks o Infi∣dels Ezek 17.16, 18, 19.. V. A Vow is of the like nature with a Promissary Oth, and ought to be made with the like Religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness Isa. 1.21.. VI. It is not to be made to any Creature but to God aone Ps. 76.11, and that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of Faith, and conscience of Duty, in way of thank∣fulness▪ for mercy received, or of the obtaining of what we want: whereby we more strictly bind our selves to necessary duties: or, to other things, so far, and so long as they may fitly conduce thereuntoDeu. 3.22, 23.. VII. No man may Vow, to do any thing forbidden in the word of God, or what would hinder any du∣ty therein commanded, or which is not in his own power, and for the performance whereof, he hath no promise of ability from God Act. 23.12, 14.. In which respect, Popish Monastical Vows of perpetual single life, pro∣fessed Poverty, and Regular Obe∣dience, are so far from being de∣grees
of higher Perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which, no Christian may intangle himself Mat. 19.11, 12. 2 Pet. 4.2.. CHAP. XXIII. Of the Civil Magistrate. GOD, the Supream Lord and King of all the world, hath or∣dained Civil Magistrates to be un∣der him, over the people for his own Glory, and the publick good: and to this end, hath armed them with the power of the sword, for the de∣fence and encouragement of them that are good, and for the punish∣ment of evil doers Rom. 13.1, 2, 3, 4.. II. It is Lawful for Christians to accept and execute the Office of a Magistrate, when called thereunto Pro. 8.15▪: in the managing whereof, as they ought especially to maintain Piety, Justice, and Peace, according to the wholsome Laws of each Common∣wealth Ps. 2.10. 1 Pet. 2.13.: so for that end, they may lawfully now under the New Te∣stament, wage War, upon just and necessary occasion Luk. 3.14 Mat. 8.9. Rev. 17.16.. III. The Civil Magistrate may not assume to himself the admini∣stration of the Word & Sacraments,
or the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven 2 Chron. 26.18. Mat. 16.9. Rom. 10.15 Heb. 5.4.: yet he hath Authority, and it is his duty, to take order that Unity and peace be pre∣served in the Church, that the truth of God be kept pure and entire, that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in worship & discipline pre∣vented, or reformed: and all the Ordinances of God duly settled, ad∣ministred and observed Isa. 49.23 Lev. 24.16. 2 King. 1 8 4. 1 Chr. 13.1. to 9.: For the better effecting whereof, he hath power to call Synods, to be present at them, and to provide that what∣soever is transacted in them, be ac∣cording to the mind of God 2 Chr. 19.8, 9, 10.. IV. It is the duty of people to pray for Magistrates 1 Tim. 2.1.2., to honour their persons 1 Pet. 2.17., to pay them tribute & other dues Rom. 15.6, 7.: to obey their lawful Commands, and to be subject to their Authority for conscience sakeRom. 13.5. Infidelity or indifference in Religion doth not make void the Magistrates just and legal Authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him 1 Pet. 2.13, 16.: From which Ecclesia∣stical persons are not exempted Rom. 13.1. Act. 25.9. Iude v. 8. to 11., much less hath the Pope any power or jurisdiction over them, in their
Dominions, or over any of their people; and least of all to deprive them of their Dominions, or lives, if he shall judge them to be Here∣ticks or upon any other pretence whatsoever 2 Ths. 2.4.. CHAP. XXIV. Of Marriage and Divorce. MArriage is to be between one Man and one Woman. nei∣ther is it lawful for any Man to have more than one Wife, nor for any Woman to have more than one Husband, at the same time Gen. 2.34. Mat. 19.5.. II. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of Husband and Wife Gen. 2.18., for the increase of Man∣kind, with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with an holy seed Mal. 2.15, and for preventing of uncleanness 1 Cor. 7.2.. III. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent Heb 13.4. 1 Cor. 7.36.. Yet, is it the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord 1 Cor. 7.39.. And therefore such as profess the true reformed Religion, should not mar∣ry with Infidels, Papists, or other Idolaters. Neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by
marrying with such as are notori∣ously wicked in their life, or main∣tain damnable heresies Gen. 34.14. Deut. 7.34. Ne. 13 25.. IV. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of Consangui∣nity or Affinity forbidden in the Word Lev. 8. chap. 1 Cor. 5.1.. Nr can such incestos Marriages ever be made lawful by any Law of man, or consent of Parties, so as those Perons may live together as Man and Wife Mar. 6.18 Levit. 18.24. to 28.. The man may not mary any of his wifes kinred nearer in blood, than he may of his own; nor, the Woan of her Husbands kindred, nearer in blood than of her own Levit. 26 19, 21.. V. Adultery or fornication com∣mitted after a Contract, being de∣tected before Mariage, giveth iust occasion to the innocent Party to dissolve that contract Mat. 1.8.19, 20.▪ In the case of Adultery after Marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce Mat. 5.31▪32., and afer the divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead Mat. 19.9. Rom. 7.2 3·. VI. Although the corruptions of man be such as is apt to study Ar∣guments, unduely to put asunder thos whom God hath jyned to∣gether in marriage: yet thing but
Adultery, or such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied by the Church, or Civil Magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of Marriage Mat. 19.8. 1 Cor. 7.15.: Wherein, a publick and orderly course of pro∣ceeding is to be observed: And, the persons concerned in it, not left to their own wills & discretion in their own case Deut. 14.1, 2, 3, 4.. CHAP. XXV. Of the Church. THE Catholick or Universal Church which is invisible, con∣sists of the whole number of the Elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof; and is the Spouse, the Body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all Ep. 1.10.. II. The Visible Church which is also Catholick or Universal, unde the Gospel (not confined to one Na∣tion, as before under the law) consist of all those, throughout the world▪ that proess the true Religion 1 Cor. 1.2 Ren. 7.9., to∣gether with their Children 1 Cor. 7.14.  Ezk. 16.20.21. Rom. 11.16: an is the Kingdom of the Lord Jesu Christ Mat. 13.47., the House and family o God Eph. 2.19. Eph. 3.15., ou of which there is no or∣dinary
possibility of Salvation Act. 2.47.. III. Unto this Catholick visible Church, Christ hath given the Mi∣nistry, Oracles, and Ordinances of God, for the gathering, and per∣fecting of the Saints, in this life to the end of the World: and doth by his own presence and spirit, ac∣cording to his promise, make them effectual thereunto 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.. IV. This Catholick Church hath been sometimes more, sometimes less visible Rom. 15.3, 4. Rev. 12.6, 24.. And particular Churches, which are Members thereof, are more or less pure, ac∣cording as the Doctrine of the Gos∣pel is taught and imbraced, Ordi∣nances administred, and publick Worship performed more or less purely in them Rev. 2.3.. V. The purest Churches under Heaven are subject both to mixture and errour 1 Cor. 13.12. Mat. 13.24 to 47., and some have so de∣generated as to become no Churches of Christ, but Synagogues of Satan Rev. 18.2. Rom. 11.18. Nevertheless, there shall be alwaies a Church on Earth to worship God according to his will Mic. 6.18. Mat. 28 1. VI. There is no other Head of the Church, but the Lord Jesus Christ Co. 1.18.. Nor can the Pope of Rome,
in any sence be head thereof: but is that Anti-Christ, that Man of sin, and Son of perdition that exalteth himself in the Church, against Christ and all that is called God Mat. 2.3, 8, 9, 10. Re. 13.6.. CHAP. XXVI. Of the Communion of Saints. ALL Saints that are united to Jesus Christ their head, by his Spirit, and by Faith, have fellowship with him in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory 1 Ioh. 1.3 Ioh. 1.16. Phi. 3.10.. And, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others gifts and graces Eph. 4.15. Col. 2.19., and are obliged to the performance of such duties publick and private, as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward & outward man1 Thes. 5.11.14. 1 Ioh. 3.16. II. Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion in the worship of God; and in performing such other spiri∣tual servics as tend to their mutual edification Heb. 10.24.25. Isa. 2.3.: as also, in relieving each other in outward things accor∣ding to their several abilities, and necessities. Which Communion, as God offereth opportunity, is to be extended unto all those, who in
every place call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus Act. 2.44. 1 Ioh. 3.17.. III. This Communion which the Saints have with Christ, doth not make them, in any wise, partakers of the substance of his God-head, or to be equal with Christ in any re∣spect: either of which to affir, is impious and blasphemus Col. 1.18.19. 1 Cor. 8.6. Isa. 41.8. Heb. 1.89.. Nor doth their Communion one with another as Saints, take away, or in∣fringe the title or propriety which each man hath in his goods and pos∣sessions Exod. 10.15. Eph. 4.28.. CHAP. XXVII. Of the Sacraments. SAcraments are holy Signs, and Seals of the Covenant of grace Rom. 4.12, immediately instituted by God Mat. 28.19., to represent Christ, and his benefits; and to confirm our interest in him1 Cor. 10.16. Ga. 3.7. as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the Church, and the rest of the world Rom. 15.8. Ex. 12.18.; and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ according to his word Rom. 6.3, 4. 1 Cor. 10.16.21.. II. There is in every Sacrament a Spiritual relation, or Sacramental union, between the sign and the
thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the names, and effects of the one, are attributed to the other Gen. 17, 10 Mat. 26.27. III. The grace which is exhibi∣ted in, or by the Sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them; neither doth the efficacy of a Sacrament depend upon the pi∣ety, or intention of him that doth ad∣minister it Rom. 2.28.; but upon the work of the Spirit Mat. 3.11. 1 Cor. 12.13, and the word of in∣stitution, which contains, together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers Mat. 16.27, 28.. IV. There be only two Sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord, in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, neither of which may be dispensed by any, but by a Minister of the word lawfully ordained Mat. 28.19. Heb. 5.4.. V. The Sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the spiri∣tual things thereby signified, and exhibited, were, for substance the same with those of the New 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4..
CHAP. XXVIII. Of Baptisme. BAptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ Mat. 28.19., not only for the so∣lemn admission of the party bapti∣zed, into the visible Church 1 Cor. 12.1, 3.: but also, to be unto him a sign and seal of the Covenant of Grace Rom. 4.11., of his ingrafting into Christ Gal. 3.27., of Regene∣ration Tit. 3.5., of Remission of sins Mat. 1.4., and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life Rom. 6.2., which Sacrament is, by Christs own appointment, to be continued in his Church, untill the end of the World Mat. 28.19, 20.. II. The outward Element to be used in the Sacrament, is Water, wherewith the party is to be Bapti∣zed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost, by a Minister of the Gospel, lawful∣ly called thereunto Mat. 3.12 Ioh. 1.33.. III. Dipping of the person into the Water, is not necessary: but, Baptism is rightly administred, by pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the person Heb. 9.10. to 22.. IV. Not only those that do actu∣ally
pofss Faith in, and obedience unto Christ Mat. 16.15.16., but also the infants of one, or both believing parents, are to be baptized Gen. 7.9. Col. 2.11.12. Act. 2.38.39. Mat. 28.19.. V. Although i be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance Luk. 7.30. Exod. 4.24., yet race and Salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be regenerated or sa∣ved without it Rom. 4.11, or that all that are baptized, are undoubtedly re∣generated Act. 8.13.. VI. The efficacy of Baptism is not yed to that moment of time, wherein it is administred Ioh. 3.58, yet notwithstanding by the right use of this Ordinance, the grace promised, is not only offered, but really exhi∣bited & confer'd by the Holy Ghost to such (whether of age, or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, accor∣ding to the Council of Gods own Will, in his appointed time Gal. 1.27.. VII. The Sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administred to any person Tit. 3 5.. CHAP. XXIX. Of the LORDS Supper. OUr Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, insti∣tuted
the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Supper to be observed in his Church, unto the end of the world, for the per∣petual Remembrance of the Sacri∣fice of himself in his Death: the sealing all benefits thereof unto true Believers, their spiritual nourish∣ment and growth in him, their fur∣ther engagement in, and to all du∣ties whih they ow unto him, and to be a Bond and Pledge of their Communion with him, and with each other, as Members of his Mysti∣cal Body 1 Cor 11.23, 24.. II. In this Sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father: nor, any real Sacrifice made at all, for re∣mission of sn of the quick or deadHeb. 9.22 28., but only a commemoration of that one, offering up of himself, by him∣self, upon the Cross, once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all pos∣sible praise unto God for the same1 Cor. 11.24, 36. Mat. 26.26. So that, the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass (as they call it) is most abo∣minably injurious to Christs one, only Sacrifice, the only propitiati∣on for all the sins of the elect Heb. 7.23 Heb. 10.12.. III. The Lord Jesus hath in this Ordinance, appointed his Minister
to declare his word of institution to the People, to pray and bless the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use: and to take, and break the Bread, to take the Cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the Communicants Mat. 26.26, 28. Luk. 22.19, but to none who are not then present in the Congre∣gation Act. 10.7.. IV. Private Masses, or receiving this Sacrament by a Priest, or any other alone 1 Cor. 10.6., as likewise the deny∣al of the Cup to the People Mat. 14.23., wor∣shipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this Sa∣crament, and to the institution of Christ Mat. 15.9.. V. The outward Elements in this Sacrament duly set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relati∣on to him crucified, as that truly, yet Sacramentally only, they are some∣times called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the Bo∣dy and Blood of ChristMat. 26.26, 27, 28.: albeit in substance and nature, they still re∣main,
truly and only Bread and Wine, as they were before 1 Cor. 11.26, 28. Mat. 26.29. VI. That Doctrine which main∣tains a change of the substance of Bread and Wine, into the substance of Christs Body and blood (com∣monly called Transubstantiation) by Consecration of a Priest, or by any other way, is repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to com∣mon sense and reason; overthrow∣eth the nature of the Sacrament, & hath been, and is the cause of mani∣fold superstitions; yea, of gross Ido∣latries Act. 3.21 Cor. 11.26.. VII. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the visible Elements, in this Sacrament 1 Cor. 2.28., do then also in∣wardly by faith really & indeed, yet not carnally & corporally, but spiri∣tually, receive, & feed upon Christ crucified, & all benefits of his death▪ The Body & Blood of Christ being then, nor corporally or carnally, in, with or under the bread and Wine: yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordi∣nance, as the Elements themselves are to their outward senses 1 Cor. 10.16.. VIII. Although ignorant, and wicked men receive the outward ele∣ments
in this Sacrament: yet they receive not the thing signified there∣by; but by their unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the body & blood of the Lord to their own dam∣nation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy Communion with him, so are they unworthy of the Lords Tale▪ and cannot without great sin against Christ while they remain such, par∣take of these holy Mysteries 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29., or be admitted thereunto 1 Cor. 5.6.. CHAP. XXX. Of Church Censures. THe Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his Church, hath there∣in appointed a Government, in the hand of Church Officers, distinct from the Civil Magistrate Isa. 9.6, 7. Act. 20 17. Mat. 28.18.. II. To these Officers, the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are com∣mitted: by vertue whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain, and remit sins: to shut that King∣dom against the impenitent, both by the word and Censures; and to open it unto penitent sinners, by the Ministry of the Gospel, and by ab∣solution
from Censures, as occasion shal require Mat. 16.19. Mat 18.17. Ioh. 20.21.. III. Church Censures are neces∣sary, for the eclaiming and gaining of offending Brethren, for deterring of oths from the like offences, for puging out of that Leaven which might infect the whole Lump, for vdicating the honour of Christ,  the holy profession of the Gos∣l, & for preventing the wrath of God, which might iustly fall upon the Church, if they should suffer his Covenant, and he Seals thereof to be rofaned by notorious and ob∣stinate offenders 1 Cor. 5. chap. Mat. 7.6. Iude v. 23.. IV. For the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the Church are to proceed by Admonition, sus∣pension from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for a season; and by Excommunication from the Church, according to the nature of the crime and demerit of the person 1 Ths. 15.12, 2. Mat. 18.17. CHAP. XXXI. Of Synods and Councils. FOr the better Government, and further edification of the Church there ought to be such Assemblies,
as are commonly called Synods or Councils Act. 15.2. II. As Magistrates may lawfully call a Synod of Ministers, and other fit persons, to consult and ad∣vise with, about matters of Reli∣gion Isa. 49.23 1 Tim. 2.12. 2 Chron. 9.8, 9, 10, 11. Mat, 2.4.5.: So, if Magistrates be open Enemies to the Church, the Mini∣sters of Christ, of themselves, by vertue of their Office; or they, with other fit persons, upon delega∣tion from their Churches, may meet together in such assemblies Act. 15.2.22, 23, 25.. III. It belongeth to Synods and Councils, Ministerially to determine Controversies of Faith, and cases of Conscience, to set down rules and Directions for the better ordering of the publick worship o God, and Government of his Church: to re∣ceive complaints in cases of malice, administration: and authoritatively, to determine the same; which Decrees and Determinations, if consonant to the word of God, are to be received with reverence, and submission: not only for their agreement with the word, but also for the power whereby they are made as being an Ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his Word Act. 15.15, 19, 24, 27, 28. Act. 16.4. Mat. 18.17 to 20..
IV. All Synods or Councils, since the Apostles times, whether general or particular, may erre, and many have erred. Therefore they are not to be made the rule of Faith, or practice; but to be used as an help in both Eph. 2.20. Act. 7.11. 1 Cor. 2.5.. V. Synods and Councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that which is Ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with Civil affairs which concern the Common wealth, unless by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary: or by way of advice, for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto required by the Civil Magistrate Luk. 12.13, 14.. CHAP. XXXII· Of the state of men after death, and of the Resurrection of the dead. THe bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corrup∣tion Gen. 3.19. Act. 13.36.: but their Souls (which neither die nor sleep) having an im∣mortal subsistence, immediately re∣turn to God who gave them Luk. 23.43. Eccl. 12.7. 2 Cor. 5.1. Phil. 1.13.: the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are re∣ceived into the highest Heavens
where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full Redemption of their Bodies Act. 3.21. And the souls of the wicked are cast into Hell, where they remain in tor∣ments and utter darkness, reserved to the Judgment of the great day Luk. 16.23, 24. 1 Pet. 3.19.. Besides these two places, for souls se∣parated from their bodies, the Scrip∣ture acknowledgeth none. II. At the last day, such as are found alive, shall not die, but be changed 1 Thes. 4.17.; and all the dead shall be raised up, with the self same bodies, and none other, although with diffe∣rent qualities, which shall be united again to their souls for ever 1 Cor. 13.42, 43, 44.. III. The Bodies of the unjust, shall by the power of Christ be raised to dishonour: the Bodies of the just by the Spirit, unto honour: and be made conformable to his own glorious Body Act. 24.15. Ioh. 5.28.. CHAP. XXXIII. Of the last judgment. GOD hath appointed a Day, wherein he will judge the World in righteousness, by Jesus Christ Act. 1.21., to whom all power and
judgment is given of the Father Ioh. 5.22.. in which day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged 1 Cor. 5.3., but like∣wise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the Tri∣bunal of Christ, to give an accompt of their thoughts, words and deeds, and to receive accordingly to what they have done in the body, whe∣ther good or evil 2 o. .10.. II. The end of Gods appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glry of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect: and, of his justice, in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked, and disobedient: For, then shall the Righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive that fulness of joy and refreshing, which shall come from the Presence of the Lord: but▪ the wicked, who know not God▪ and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal Torments, and be pnished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of hs power Mat. 25 31 Rom. .22, 23▪. III. As Christ would have us to be certainly perswaded that thr shall be a Day of Judgment, both
to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity Pet. 3.11: so, will he have that day unknown to Men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be alwaies watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come: and, may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly, Amen M. 24.6.

the publick and private exercises of Gods worship Isa. 58.13 Act. 20.7.

Why is the word Remem∣ber set in the beginning of the fourth Commandment? A. The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth Command∣ment
Ex. 20.8., partly because of the great benefit of remembring it: we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep itEx. 16.23.

SO much of every Question both in the Larger and Shorter Cate∣chism, is repeated in the Answer, as maketh every Answer an entire Proposition, or Sentence in it self; to the end, the Learner may further improve it upon all occasions, for his increase in knowledge and piety▪ e∣ven out of the course of catechising, as well as in it. And albeit the substance of the doctrine comprised in that abridge∣ment, commonly called the Apostles Creed, be fully set forth in each of the Catechisms, so as there is no necessity of inserting the Creed it self, yet it is here annexed, not as though it were composed by the A∣postles, or ought to be esteeed Canonical Scripture, as the ten Commandments, and the Lords Prayer (much less a Prayer, as ig∣norant people have been apt to make both it and the Decalogue) but because it is a brief sum of the Christian Faith, agreeable to the Word of God, and anciently recei∣ed in the Churches of Christ.
THE SUMME OF SAVING KNOWLEDGE, With the Practical use thereof. John 6.37. All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. EDINBVRGH, Printed by George Swintoun, and Thomas Brown, and are to be sould by Iames Glen, and David Trench. 1671.
A brief Sum of Christian Doctrine, Contained In Holy Scriptures, and holden forth in the Confession of Faith & Catechism. Agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminstr, and received by the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland. The sum of Saving knowledge may be taken up in these four heas. 1. The woeful condition whr∣in all men are by nature, through breaking of the Covenant of Works. 2. The Rmedy prvided for the Elect in Iesus Christ, by the Covenant of Grace. 3. The means appointed o make them partkers of this Covenant. 4. The blessigs which are effectually convyed unto the Elect by these means. Which four heads are set down each of them in some fw Propositions. HEAD 1. Our woful condition by nature, through breaking the Cove∣nant of Works. Hos. 13 9. O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self. THe Almighty and Eternal God the Fa∣ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, three ditinct persons, in one and the same undivided God-head, equally ininite in all perfections; did before time most wisely decree for his own glory, whatsoever cometh to pass in time, and
doth most holily, and infallibly execute all hi Decrees▪ without being partaker of the sin  any creature. II. This God in six days made all things  nothing very good in their own kind, in special he made all the Angels holy; and he mad our first Parents Adam and Eve, the root  mankind▪ both upright and able to keep the Law written in their heart. Which Law the were naturally bound to obey under pain  death, but God was not bound to reward thei service, till he entered in a Covenant or Con∣tract with them, and their posterity in them▪ to give them eternal life upon condition of per∣fect personal obedience, withal threatning death in case they should fail. This is the Co∣venant of Works. III. Both Angels and Men are subject to the change of their own free-will as experience proveth (God having reserved to himself the incommunicable property of being naturally unchangeable) For many Angels of their own accord fell by sin from their first estate and became Devils our first Parents being inticed by Satan, one of these Devils speaking in a serpent▪ did break the Covenant of Works in eating the forbidden Fruit▪ whereby they and their posterity being in their loins, as branches in the root, and comprehended in the same Covenant with them, became not only lyable to eternal death, but also lost all ability to please God; yea did become by nature ene∣mies
to God and to all spiritual good, and  lined only to evil continually. This is our original sin, the bitter root of all our actual transgressions▪ in thought, word▪ and deed. HEAD II. The remedy provided in Jesus Christ for the Elect by the Co∣venant of Grace; Hos. 13.9. O I∣srael, thou hast destroyed thy self, but in me is thine help. ALbeit man, having brought himself into this woeful condition be neither able to elp himself, nor willing to be helped by God ut of it, but rather inclined to ly still unsen∣le of it, till he perish: yet God for the glory f his rich Grace, hath revealed in his Word way to save sinners, to wit, by faith in Jesus Christ the Eternal Son of God, by vertue of nd according to, the tenor of the Covenant of Redemption, made and agreed upon between God the Father and God the Son, in the coun∣sel of the Trinity before the World began. II. The sum of the Covenant of Redempti∣on is this, God having freely chosen unto life, a ertain number of lost mankind, for the glory f his rich Grace did give them before the world began, unto God the Son appointed Re∣deemer, that upon condition he would humble imself so far as to assume the humane natur f a soul and body, unto personal union with is Divine Nature, and submit himself
Law as surety for them, and satisfie Justice for them, by giving obedience in their name, even unto the suffering of the cursed death of the Cross, he should ransom and redeem them all from sin and death, and purchase unto them righteousness and eternal life, with all saying graces leading thereunto, to be effectually, by means of his own appointment, applyed in due time to every one of them. This condition the Son of God (who is Jesus Christ our Lord) did accept before the world began, and in the fulness of time came into the World, was born of the Virgin Mary, subjected himself to the Law, and compleatly payed the ransome on the Cross: but by vertue of the foresaid bar∣gain made before the World began, he is in all ages since the fall of Adam, still upon the work of applying actually the purchased benefits unto the elect: and that he doth by way of en∣tertaining a Covenant of free grace and recon∣ciliation with them, through faith in himself, which Covenant he makes over to every be∣liever a right and interest to himself, and to all his blessings. III. For the accomplishment of this Cove∣nant of Redemption, and making the Elect par∣takers of the benefits thereof in the Covenant of Grace, Christ Jesus was clad with the three∣old Office of Prophet, Priest, and King. Made a Prophet, to reveal all saving knowledge to his people, and to perswade them to believe and  the same▪ Made a Priest, to offer up him∣self
a sacrifice once for them all, and to inter∣ceed continually with the Father for making their persons and services acceptable to him. And made a King, to subdue them to himself, to feed and rule them by his own appointed Ordinances, and to defend them from their enemies. HEAD 3. The outward means ap∣pointed to make the Elect partakers of this Covenant, and all the rest that are called to be inexcusable, Mat. 22.14. Many are called. THe outward means and ordinances for making men partakers of the Covenant of Grace are so wisely dispenced, as the Elect hall be infallibly converted and saved by them, and the Reprobate among whom they are not, be justly stumbled. The means are specially these four. 1. The Word of God. 2. The Sacraments. 3. Kirk Government. . Prayer. In the Word of God preached by ent Messengers, the Lord makes offer of Grace to all sinners upon condition of faith in Jesus Christ, and whosoever do confess their sin, accept of Christ offered, and submit them∣selves to his Ordinances, he will have both them and their children received into the ho∣nour and priviledges of the Covenant of Grace. By the Sacraments God will have the
Covenant sealed for confirming the bargain on the foresaid condition. By Kirk Government he will have them edge in, and help fore∣ward unto the keeping of the Covenant. And by Prayer, he will have his own glrious Grace promised in the Covenant, to be daily drawn forth, acknowledged and imployed. All which means are fllowed either really, or in profes∣sion only, according to the quality of the Co∣enanters, as they ae true or counterit be∣lievers, II. The Covenant of Grace set down in the Old Testament before Christ came, and in the New since he came, is one and the same in sub∣stance, albeit different in outward administra∣tion: for the Covenant in the Old Testament, being sealed with the Sacraments of Circumcisi∣on and the Paschal Lamb did set forth Christs death to come, and the benefits purchased thereby, under the shadow of bloody sacrifi∣ces and sundry ceremonies: but since Christ came, the Covenant, being sealed by the Sacra∣ments of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, do clearly hold forth Christ already crucified be∣fore our eyes, victorious over death, and the grave, and gloriously ruling Heaven, and Earth for the good of his own people.
HEAD IV. The blessngs which a effectually conveyed by these mea to the Lords Elect or chosen one Mat. 22.24. Many are called,  few are chosen. BY these outward Ordinances as our Lord makes the Reprobate inexcusable so, in the power of his Spirit, he applies unto the Elect effectually, all saving graces purchased to them, in the Covenant of Redemption, and maketh a change in their persons. In particular, 1. He doth convert or regenerate them, by giving spiritual life to them, in openng their understandings, renewing their wills, affections and faculties, for giving spiritual obedience to his commands. 2. He gives unto them saving Faith by making them in the sense of deserved condemnation, to give their consent heartily to the▪ Covenant of Grace, and to imbrace Christ Jesus unfained. 3. He gives them Re∣pentance, by making them, with Godly sorrow in the hatred of sin, and love of Righteousness: turn from all iniquity to the service of God, and, 4. He Sanctifies them, by making them go on and persevere in faith, and spiritual obedi∣ence of the Law of God, manifested by fruit∣fulness in all duties, and doing good works, as God offereth occasion. II. Together with this inward change of their Persons, God changes also their state: for
so soon as they are brought by Faith into the Covenant of Grace, 1. He Iustifies them, by imputing unto them, that perfect obedience which Christ gave to the Law, and the satisfa∣ction also which upon the Cross Christ gave un∣to Justice in their name. 2. He Reconcials them, and makes them friends to God, who were before enemies to God. 3. He Adoptes them that they should be no more children of Satan, but children of God, inriched with all spiritual priviledges of his Sons: And last of all, after their warfare in this life is ended, he per∣fects the holiness and blessedness, first of their souls at their death, and then both of their souls and their bodys, being joyfully joyned toge∣ther again, in the Resurrection, at the day of his Glorious coming to Judgment▪ when all the wicked shall be sent away to Hell, with Satan whom they have served; but Christs own chosen and redeemed ones true Believers, Stu∣dents of holiness, shall remain with himself for ever, in the state of Glorification.
The practical use of Saving Knowledge, Contained in Scripture, and holden forth briefly in the foresaid Confessi∣ons of Faith and Catechisms. THe chief general use of Christian Doctrine is, to convince a man of sin, and of Righ∣teousness, and of Judgment, Iohn 16.8. Part∣ly by the Law or Covenant of Works, that he may be humbled and become penitent, and partly by the Gospel or Covenant of Grace, that he may become an unfained believer in Je∣sus Christ, and be strengthened in his faith by good fruits▪ and so be saved. The sum of the Covenant of Works, or of the Law, is this, If thou do all that is commanded, and not fail in any point, thou shalt be saved: But if thou fail, thou shalt die. Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.10, 12. The sum of the Gospel or Covenant of grace and Reconciliation is this, If thou flee from de∣served wrath, to the true Reedemer Iesus Christ, (who is able to save to the uttermost all that come to God, through him) thou shalt not pe∣rish
but have eternal life, Rom. 10.8.9, 11. For convincing a man of sin, of Righteous∣ness, and of Judgment by the Law▪ or Cove∣nant of Works let these Scriptures among many more be made use of. 1. For convincing a man of sin by the Law: consider, Ier. 17.9, 10. THe heart is dceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, vn to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: Here the Lord teacheth these two things. 1. That the fountain of all our miscarriage and actual sinning against God is in the heart, which comprehendeth the mind, will, affections and all the powers of the soul, as they are cor∣rupted and defiled with original sin: the mind being not only ignorant and uncapable of sav∣ing truth; but also full of error and enmity a∣gainst God▪ and the will and affections being obstinately disobedient unto all Gods directi∣ons▪ and bent toward that only which is evil▪ The heart, saith he, is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; yea, and unsearchably wicked: so that no man can know it, and Gen. 6.5. Every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is only evil continually (saith the Lord) whose testimony we must trust in this and all o∣ther matters: and experience also may teach us, that till God make us deny our selves, we
ever look to God in any thing▪ but fleshly elf interest alone doth rule us and move all the wheels of our actions. 2. That the Lord bringeth our original sin r wicked inclination, withal the actual fruits hereof, unto reckoning before his Judgment eat, for he searcheth the heart and tryeth the eins, to give every man according to his ways, nd according to the fruit of his doings. Hence let every man reason thus: What God and my guilty conscience beareth witness of, I am convinced that it is true. But God and my guilty conscience beareth witness, that my heart is deceitful above all hings▪ and desperately wicked; and that all he imaginations of my heart, by nature, are only evil continually. Therefore I am convinced that this is true. Thus a man may be convinced of sin by the Law. For convincing a man of righteousness by the Law, consider, Gal. 3.10. AS many as are of the wrks of the Law, are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is very ne that continueth not in all things which are ritn in th Book of te Law to o them. Here the Apostle teacheth us three things. 1. That by reason of our natural sinfulness,  impossibility of any mans being justified y the works of the Law is so certain, that
whosoever do seek Justification by the work of the Law, are liable to the curse of God, fo breaking of the Law; for, as many as are of  works of the Law are under the curse, saith he. 2. That unto the perfect fulfilling of th Law, the keeping of one or two of the prcepts, or doing of some, or of all duties (if  were possible) for a time is not sufficient;  the Law requireth, that a man continue in  things which are written in the Book of the Law,  do them. 3. That because no man can come up to th perfection every man by nature is under th curse; for the Law saith Cursed is every one th continueth not in all things, which are written  the Book of the Law, to do them. Now to be under the curse, comprehende all the displeasure of God, with the danger  the breaking forth more and more of his wrat upon soul and body, both in this life and afte death perpetually, if grace do not prevent th full execution thereof. Hence let every man reason thus: Whosoever, according to the Covenant o Works is liable to the curse of God, for breaking the Law, times and ways out of number cannot be justified or find righteousness by the works of the Law. But I (may every man say) according to th Covenant of Works, am liable to the curse  God, for breaking the Law, times and ways  of number.
Therefore I cannot be justified, or have ghteousness by the works of the Law. Thus may a man be convinced of righteous∣, that it is not to be had by his own works  by the Law. . For convincing a man of Judgment by the Lavv: consider, 2 Thes. 1.7. THe Lord shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, ver. 8. In flaming  aking vengeance on them that know not ▪ and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord  Christ. ver. 9. Who shall be punished with erlasting destruction from the presence of the , and from the glory of his power. ver. 10. hen he shall come to be glorified in his saints,  to be admired in all them that believe. Wherein we are taught, that our Lord Jesus, ho now offers to be Mediator for them who eleve in him, shall at the last day, come armed ith flaming fire, to judge, condemn and de∣roy all them who have not believed God,  not received the offer of grace made in  Gospel, nor obeyed the Doctrine thereof;  remain in their natural estate under the aw or Covenant of Works. Hence let every man reason thus: What the righteous Judge hath fore-warn∣d, me shall be done, at the last day, I am sure  just judgement. But the righteous Judge hath fore-warned e, that if I do not believe God in time, and
obey the Doctrine of the Gospel, I shall  secluded from his presence and his glory, at t last day, and be tormented in soul and body  ever. Therefore I am convinced that this is  Judgement. And I have reason to thank God heartil who hath forewarned me to flee from the wrat which is to come. Thus every man may be, by the Law or Cvenant of Works, convinced of judgment,  he shall continue under the Covenant  Works, or shall not obey the Gospel of ou Lord Jesus. For convincing a man of sin, righteousness, and judgment by the Gospel. AS for convincing a man of sin, and righteousness, and judgment by the Gospe or Covenant of grace, he must understan three things. 1. That not believing in Jesu Christ, or refusing of the Covenant of Grace offered in him, is a greater and more danger∣ous sin, then all other sins against the Law because the hearers of the Gospel▪ not belie∣ving in Christ, do reject Gods mercy in Christ▪ the only way of freedom from sin and wrath, and will not yield to be reconciled to God. Next, he must understand that perfect remissi∣on of sin and true righteousness is to be had on∣ly by faith in Jesus; because God requireth no
ther conditions but Faith, and testfiies from eaven that he is well pleased to justifie sinners pon this condition. 3. He must understand hat, upon righteousness received by faith, udgment shall follow on the one hand, to the estroying of the works of the Devil in the eliever, and to the perfecting of the work of anctification in him, with power: and that pon refusing to take righteousness by Faith in esus Christ, Judgment shall follow on the o∣her hand, to the condemnation of the misbe∣ever, and destroying of him with Satan and is servants for ever. For this end let these passages of Scripture, mong many others, serve to make the great∣ess of the sin of not believing in Christ appear, r to make the greatness of the sin of refusing f the Covenant of Grace, offered to us, in he offering of Christ unto us, let the fair offer f Grace be looked upon as it is made, Isa. 55. . Incline your ear and come unto me (saith the ord) hear, and your soul shall live, and I will ake an everlasting Covenant with you, even he sure mercies of David. That is, if ye will elieve me, and be reconciled to me, I will by Covenant▪ give unto you Christ, and all sa∣ing graces in him; repeated, Acts 13.24. Again consider that this general offer in ubstance is equivalent to a special offer made o every one in particular, as appeareth by e Apostles making use of it, Acts 16.13. elieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved and thy house. The reason o which offer is given Ih. 3.16. For God so lov the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, th whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, bu have everlasting life. Seeing then this grea salvation is offered in the Lord Jesus, whosoe∣ver believe not in him, but lok for happines some other way, what doth he else, but observ lying vanities, and forsake his own mercy whic he might have had in Christ? Ionh 2.8, ▪ What doth he else but blaspheme God in hi heart? as it is said, 1 Iohn 5.10. He that be∣lieveth not God, hath made him a liar, because  believeth not the record that God gave of his Son and this is the record, that God hath given to us eter∣nal life, and this life is in his Son; and that no si against the Law is like unto this sin, Christ te∣stifies, Iohn 15.22. If I had not come and spoke to them▪ they had not h sin; but now they hav no cloak for their sin. This may convince  man of the greatness of this sin of not belie∣ving in Christ. For convincing a man of righteousness to be had only by faith in Christ  consider how, Rom. 10.3, 4. IT Is said, that the Iews being ignorant o Gods righteousness, and going about to establis their own righteousness. have not submitted them∣selves unto the righteousness of God, (and so they perished) for Christ is the end of the La
righteousness to every one that believeth: and cts 13.34. By Christ Iesus all that believe, are stified from all things, from which ye could not be stified by the Law of Moses: and 1 Iohn 1.7.  blood of Iesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from  sin. For convincing a man of judgement, if a an imbrace this righteousness: consider,  Iohn 3.8. For this purpose the Son of God was nifested that he mit destroy the works of the evil. and Heb. 9.14. How much more shall the  of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit,  himself without spot to God, purge your consci∣ce from dead works to serve the living God. But if a man imbrace not this righteousness,  is pronounced, Iohn 3.18. He that be∣veth not is condemned already; because he hath  believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of . And this is the condemnation, that light is  into the World, nd men love darkness rather  light. Hence let the penitent desiring to believe, ason thus: What doth suffice to convince all the Elect  the world of the greatness of the sin of not lieving in Christ, or refusing to flee to him  relief from sins done against the Law, and om wrath due thereto? and what sufficeth  convince them that righteousness and eter∣l life is to be had by Faith in Jesus Christ, or  consenting to the Covenant of Grace in him?
and what sufficeth to convince them of Judge∣ment to be exercised by Christ for destroying the works of the Devil in a man, and sanctify∣ing and saving all that believe in him, may suf∣fice to convince me also. But what the Spirit hath said in these or o∣ther like Scriptures, sufficeth to convince the Elect world of the foresaid sin and righteous∣ness and Judgment. Therefore what the Spirit hath said in these and other like Scriptures, serveth to convince me thereof also. Whereupon let the penitent desiring to be∣lieve take with him words, and say heartily to the Lord; Seeing thou sayet, seek ye my Face▪ my soul answereth unto thee, thy face, Lor will I seek, I have hearkned unto the offer of an everlasting Covenant of all saving mercies to be had in Christ, and I do heartily embrace thy offer, Lord let it be a bargain, Lord I be∣lieve, help my unbelief: Behold I give my self to thee to serve thee in all things for ever, and I hope they right and shall save me, the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me. Thy mercy▪ O Lord endureth for ever, forsake not the works of thy own hands. Thus may a mn be made an unfained believer in Christ.
For strengthning the mans Faith who hath agreed unto the Covenant of Grace. BEcause many true believers are weak, and do much doubt if ever they shall be sure of the soundness of their own Faith and Effe∣ctual calling, or made certain of their Justifica∣tion and Salvation, when they see, that many, who profess faith, are found to deceive them∣selves; let us see how every believer may be made strong in the faith, and sure of his own Election and Salvation upon solid grounds by sure warrants and true evidences of faith. To this end among many other Scriptures, take these following. 1. For laying solid grounds of faith, consi∣der, 2 Pet. 1.10. Wherefore the rather, brethren▪ give diligence to make sure your calling and election, for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. In which words the Apostle teacheth us these four things, for help and direction, how to be made strong in the faith. 1. That such as believe in Christ Jesus, and are fled to him for relief from sin and wrath, albeit they be weak in the faith, yet they are indeed Children of the same Father with the Apostles: for so he accounteth of them, while he called them brethren. 2. That albeit we be not sure, for the time of our effectual calling and election, yet we may
be made sure of both, if we use diligence: for this he presupposeth, saying, Give diligence to make your calling and election sure. 2. That we must not be discouraged, when we see many seeming believers prove rotten branches and make defection, but we must the rather take the better heed to our selves Wherefore the rather, brethren, saith he, give all diligence. 4. That the way to be sure both of our effe∣ctual calling, and Election, is to make sure work of our Faith, by laying the grounds of it solidly, and bringing forth the fruits of our faith in new obedience constantly, For if ye do these thing, saith he, ye shall never fall; un∣derstand by these things, what he had said of sound faith, ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. And what he had said of the bringing out of the fruits of faith, ver. 5, 6, 7, 8. To this same purpose, consider, Rom. 1.8. There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. ver. 2. For the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the Law of sin and death. ver. 3. For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinfull flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. ver. 4. That the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Wherein the Apostle teacheth us these four things, for laying of the ground of faith so∣lidly. 1. That every one is a true believer, who in the sense of his sin and fear of Gods wrath doth flee for full relief from both unto Jesus Christ alone, as the only Mediator, and all-suf∣ficient Redeemer of men, and being fled to Christ, doth strive against his own flesh, or corrupt inclination of nature, and studieth to follow the rule of Gods Spirit, set down in his Word; for the man whom the Apostle doth here bless as a true believer, is a man in Christ Jesus, who doth not walk after the flesh, but after he Spirit. 2. That all such persons as are fled to Christ, nd do strive against sin, howsoever they may e possibly exercised under the sense of wrath, nd fear of condemnation, yet they are in no anger; for there is no condemnation (saith he) o them that are in Christ Iesus, who walk not fter the flesh, but after the Spirit. 3. That albeit the Apostle himself (brought  here for examples cause) and all other true elievers in Christ, be, by nature, under the aw of sin and death, or under the Covenant f Works, (called the Law of sin and death, ecause it bindeth sin and death upon us, till hrist set us free) yet the Law of the spirit of e in Christ Jesus, or the Covenant of Grace o called, because it doth inable and quicken man to a spiritual life through Christ) doth
set the apostle and all true believers free from the Covenant of Work or the Law of sin and death, so that every man may say with him, The Law of the Spirit of life, or the Covenant of Grace, hath freed me from the Law of sin and death, or Covenant of Works. 4. That the fountain and first ground from whence our freedom from the curse of the Law doth flow, is the Covenant of Redem∣ption, past betwixt God, and God the Son, as incarnate, wherein Christ takes the Curse of the Law upon him for sin, that the believer, who could not otherwise be delivered from the Covenant of Works, may be delivered from it. And this Doctrine the Apostle holdeth forth in these four branches. 1. That it was utter∣ly▪ impossible for the Law, or Covenant of works, to bring righteousness and life to a sin∣ner because it was weak. 2. That this weak∣ness and inability of the Law, or Covenant of Works, is not the fault of the Law, but the fault of sinfull flesh, which is neither able to ay the penalty of sin, nor to give perfect obe∣dience to the Law (presuppose by-gone sins were forgiven) the Law was weak (saith he) through the flesh. 3. That the righteousness and salvation of sinners, which was impossible to be brought about by the Law, is brought to pass by sending Gods own Son, Jesus Christ in the flesh, in whose flesh sin is condemned and punished, for making satisfaction in the behalf of the Elect, that they might be set free.
4. That by his means the Law loseth nothing, because the righteousness of the Law is best fulfilled this way: First by Christ, giving per∣fect active obedience in our name unto it in all things: Next, by his paying, in our name, the penalty, (due to our sins) in his death. And lastly, by his working of Sanctification in us, who are true believers, who strive to give new obedience unto the Law, and walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Warrants yo believe. FOr building our confidnce upon ths solid ground, these four Warrants and special motives to believe in Christ may serve: The 1. whereof is Gods hearty invitation, holden forth, Isa. 55.1, , 3, 4, 5. Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the wa∣ters, and he that hath no money, come and buy without money, and without price. ver. 2. Where∣fore do ye spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight it self in fatness. ver. 3. Incline your ear and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mer∣cies of David. ver. 4. Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people, &c.
Here (after setting down the precious ran∣som of our Redemption by the sufferings of Christ, and the rich blessings purchased to us thereby in the two former Chapters) the Lord, in this Chapter, 1. Maketh open offer of Christ and his grace by proclamation of a free and gracious market of Righteousness and Salvation; to be had through Christ to every soul without excepti∣on, that truly desires to be saved from sin and wrath; o, every one that thirsteth, saith he. 2. He inviteth all sinners, that, for any rea∣son, stand at distance with God, to come and take from him riches of grace running in Christ as a River to wash away sin, and to slacken wrath: Come ye to water, saith he. 3. Lest any should stand back, in the sense of his own sinfulness or unworthiness and in∣aility to do any good, the Lord calleth upon such persons in special, saying, He that hath no money, come. . H craveth no more of his Merchant, but that he be pleased with the wares offered, which are grace and more grace, and that he heartily consent unto, and imbrace this offer of grace, that so he may close a bargain and a formal Covenant with Godpunc; Come, buy without money (saith he) Come eat, that is, consent to have, and take unto you all saving graces, make the wares your own, possess them, and make use of all blessings in Christ, whatsoever ma∣keth for your spiritual life and comfort, use and
enjoy it freely, without paying any thing for it. Come, buy wine and milk without money and with∣out price, saith he, 5. Because the Lord knoweth how much we are inclined to seek righteousness and life by our own performances, and satisfaction to have righteousness and lfepunc; as it were by the way of works, and how loth we are to em∣brace Christ Jesus, and to take life by way of free grace, through Jesus Christ, upon the tearm whereupon it is offered to us, therefore the Lord lovingly calls us off this our crooked and unhappy way, with a gentle and timous admonition, giving us to understand that we shall but lose our labour in this our way, Where∣fore do ye spend your money (saith he) for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not? 6. The Lord promiseth to us solid satisfacti∣on, in the way of betaking our selves unto the grace of Christ, even true cntentment, and fulness of spiritual pleasure, saying, Hearken di∣ligently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight its self in fatness. 6. Because faith cometh by hearing, he cal∣leth for audience unto the explication of the offer, and calleth for believing of, and listen∣ing unto the truth, which is able to beget the application of saving faith and to draw the soul to trust in God. Incline your ear and come unto me, saith he. To which end the Lord promiseth, that this offer, being, received, shall quicken
the dead sinner, and that upon the welcom∣ing of this offer, he will close the Covenant of Grace with the man that shall consent unto it, even an indissolvable Covenant of perpetual Reconciliation and Peace, Hearken and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting Cove∣nant with you. Which Covenant he declareth, shall be in substance the assignation, and the making over of all the saving graces, which David (who is Jesus Christ, Act. 13.34.) hath brought for us in the Covenant of Redemption, I will make a Covenant with you (saith he) even the sure mercies of David. By sure mercies he means saving graces, such as are righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Adoption, Sancti∣fication, and Glorification, and whatsoever be∣longs to Godliness, and life eternal. 8. To confirm and assure us of the real grant of these saving mercies, and to perswade us of the reality of the Covenant betwixt God and the believer of this word, the Father hath made a fourfold gift of his eternal and only begotten Son. First, to be incarnate and born, for our sake, of the seed of David, his type, for which cause he is called here, and Act. 13.34. (David the true and everlasting King of Israel.) This is the great gift of God to man, Iohn. 4.10. And here [I have given him to be David, or born of David to the people]
Secondly, he hath made a gift of Christ to be a witness to the people, both of the sure and saving mercies granted to the redeemed in the Covenant of Redemption, and also of the Fathers willingness, and purpose to apply them, and to make them fast in the Covenant of Reconciliation made with such as imbrace the offer; I have given him (saith the Lord here) to be a witness to the people: and truly he is a sufficient witness in this manner, in many respects. 1. Because he is one of the Persons of the blessed Trinity, and party con∣tracter for us, in the Covenant of Redemption before the World was. 2. He is by Office as Mediator, the Messenger of the Covenant, and hath gotten commission to reveal it. 3. He began actually to reveal it in Paradise, where he promised that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the Serpent. 4. He set forth his own death and suffring, and the great benefits that should come threby to us, in the types and figures of sacrifices and ceremonies before his coming. 5. He gave more and more light  this Covenant, speaking by his Spirit, thou ag to age, in the holy prophets. 6. He came himlf  the fulness of time, and did bear witness of all things belonging to this Covenant, ad of Gods willing mind to take believers into it, partly by uniting our na∣ture in one person with the Dvine Nature, party by Preaching the good tidings of the Covenant with his own mouth, partly by
paying the price of Redemption on the Cross, and partly by dealing still with the people from the beginning to this day, to draw in and to hold in the redeemed in this Cove∣nant. Thirdly, God hath made a gift of Christ, as a Leader to the people, to bring us through all difficulties, all afflictions and temptations, unto life, by this Covenant. And he it is, and no o∣ther, who doth indeed lead his own unto the Covenant, and in the Covenant all the way on unto salvation. 1. By the direction of his word and Spirit. 2. By the example of his own life, in faith and obedience, even to the death of the Cross. 3. By his powerful working, bearing his redeemed ones in his arms, and causing them to lean on him, while they go up through the wilderness. Fourthly, God hath made a gift of Christ unto his people, as a Commander; which Of∣fice he faithfully exerciseth, by giving to his Kirk and people, Laws and Ordinances, Pa∣stours and Governours, and all necessary Offi∣cers, by keeping Couts and Assemblies among them to see that his Laws be obeyed: Subdu∣ing by his Word, Spirit and Discipline, his peoples corruptions; and by his Wisdom and power, guarding them against their enemies whatsoever. Hence he who hath closed bargain with God, may strengthen his faith, by reasoning after this manner.
Whosoever doth heartily receive the offer of free grace made here to sinners, thirsting for righteousness and salvation, unto him by ever∣lasting Covenant belongeth Christ the true Da∣vid, with all his sure and saving mercies. But I (may the weak believer say) do heartily receive the offer of free grace, made here to sin∣ners, thiring for righteousness and salvation. Therefore unto me, by an everlasting Cove∣venant belongeth Christ Jesus, with all his sre and saving mercies. The second warrant and special mo∣tive to imbrace Christ and believe in him is the earnest request that God maketh to us to be reconciled to him in Christ, holden forth, 2 Cor. 5. ver. 14.19.2.21. GOd was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them: and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. ver. 20. Now then we are Em∣bassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconci∣led to God. ver. 21. For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Wherein the Apostle teacheth us these nine Doctrines. 1. That the elect World, or the World
redeemed souls, are by nature in the estate of enmity against God. This is presuppo∣sed in the word Reconciliation; for reconci∣liation, or renewing of friendship, cannot be, except betwixt those that have been at en∣mity. 2. That in all the time by-past, since the fall of Adam, Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of God, as Mediator, and the Father in him, hath been about the making friendship (by his word and Spirit) betwixt himself and the elect World, God (saith he) was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. 3. That the way of reconciliation was in all ages one and the same in substance, viz. by for∣giving the sins of them who do acknow∣ledge their sins, and their enmity against God, and do seek reconciliation and remission of sins in Christ, for God (saith he) was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, by way of not imputing their trespasses unto them. 4. That the end and scope of the Gospel and whole word of God, is threefold. 1. It serveth to make people sensible of their sins, and of their enmity against God, and of their danger if they should stand out, and not fear Gods displeasure. 2. The word of God serveth to make men acquainted with the course which God hath pre∣pared for making friendship with him through Christ, viz. That if men shall acknowledge the enmity, and shall be content to enter into a
Covenant of friendship with God, through Christ, then God will be contented to be re∣conciled with them freely. 3. The word of God serveth to teach men how to carry themselves towards God, as friends, after they are reconciled to him, viz. to be loath to sin against him, and to strive heartily to obey his Commandments, and therefore the Word of God here is called the Word of Reconciliation, because it teacheth us, what need we have of reconciliation, and how to make it, and how to keep the reconciliation of friendship, being made with God through Christ. 5. That albeit the hearing, believing, and obeying of this word, doth belong to all those to whom this Gospel doth come, yet the Office of preaching of it, with authority, belongeth to none but to such only as God doth call to this ministry, and sendeth out with Commis∣sion for this work. This the Apostle holdeth forth, ver. 18. in these words, he hath commit∣ted to us the word of Reconciliation. 6. That the Ministers of the Gospel should behave themselves as Christs Messen∣gers, and should closely follow their com∣mission set down in the word, Matth. 28.19, 20. and when they do so, they should be received by the people, as Ambassadours from God: for here the Apole, in all their names, saith, we are Embassadours for Christ,
as though God did beseech you by us. 7. That Ministers in all earnestness of affe∣ctions should deal with people, to acknow∣ledge their sins, and their natural enmity a∣gainst God more and more seriously: and to consent to the Covenant of Grace and Embas∣sage of Christ more and more heartily; and to evidence more and more clearly their re∣conciliation by a holy carriage before God. This he holdeth forth, when he saith, we pray you be reconciled to God. 8. That in the Ministers affectionate dealing with the people, the people should consider, that they have to do with God and Christ, requesting them by the Ministers to be recon∣ciled, now there cannot be a greater induce∣ment to break a sinners hard heart, than Gods making request to him for friendship: For when it became us, who have done so many wrongs to God, to seek friendship of God, he pre∣venteth, and (O wonder of wonders!) he re∣questeth us to be content to be reconciled wit him: and therefore most fearful wrath must abide them, who do set light by this request; and do not yield when they hear Ministers with Commission, saying, We are Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God. 9. To make it appear, how it cometh to pass that the Covenant of Reconciliation should be so easily made up betwixt God and
a humble sinner fleeing to Christ, the Apostle leads us unto the cause of it, holden forth in the Covenant of Redemption; the sum where∣of is this. It is agreed betwixt God and the me∣diator Iesus Christ the Son of God Surety for the redeemed, as parties contractors, that the sins of the redeemed should be imputed to innocent Christ, and he both condemned and put to death for them upon this very condition, that whosoever heartily consents unto the Covenant of Reconciliation of∣fered through Christ, shall by the imputation of his obedience unto them, be justified and holden righ∣teous before God, for God hath made Christ who knew no sin, to be sin for us (saith the Apostle) that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him. Hence may a weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning from this ground after this manner. He that upon the loving request of God and Christ, made to him by the mouth of his Ministers (having Commission to that effect) hath embra∣ced the offer of perpetual reconciliation through Christ, and do purpose by Gods Grace, as a reconciled person to strive against sin, and to serve God to his power constantly, may be as sure to have righteous∣ness, and eternal life given to him for the obedience of Christ imputed to him, as it is sure that Christ was condemned and put to death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him.
But I (may the weake believer say) upon the loving request of God and Christ made to me by the mouth of his Ministers, have imbraced the offer of perpetual reconciliation through Christ, and do purpose by Gods grae, as a reconciled per∣son, to strive against sin, and to serve God to my power constantly. Therefore I may be as sure to have righteous∣ness and ternal life given to me for the obedience of Christ imputed to me, as it is sure that Christ was condemned and put to death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him. The third warrant and special motive to believe in Christ, is the strait and awful command of God, charging all the hearers of the Gospel to ap∣proach to Christ, in the order set down by him, and to believe in him: holden forth, 1 Ioh. 3.23. THis is his Commandment, that we should be∣lieve on the name of his Son Iesus Christ, and love one another, as be gave us command∣ment. Wherein the Apostle giveth us to under∣stand these five Doctrines. 1. That f any man shall not be taken with the swet invitation of God, nor with the humbe and loving request of God made to him to be reconciled, he shall find he hath
to do with the Soveraign Authority of the highest Majesty; for this is his commandment, that we believe in him, saith he. 2. That if any man look upon this Com∣mand as he hath looked heretofore upon the neglected Commandments of the Law; he must consider that this is a command of the Gospel, posterior to the Law, given for making use of the remedy of all sins; which if it be diso∣beyed, there is no other Command to follow but this: Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire of Hell: for this is his commandment: the obe∣dience of which is most pleasant in his sight, ver. 22. And without which it is impossible to please him, Heb. 11.6. 3. That every one who heareth the Gospel, must make conscience of the duty of lively faith in Christ, the weak believer must not think it presumption to do what is comman∣ded: the person inclined to despiration must take up himself, and think upon obedience unto this sweet and saving command: the strong believer must dip yet more in the sense of his need he hath of Jesus Christ, and more and more grow in the obedience of this com∣mand, yea, the most impenitent, prophane and wicked person, must not thrust out himself, or be thrust out by others, from orderly aiming at this duty, how desperate soever his conditi∣on seem to be; for he that commands all men to believe in Christ, doth thereby command all men to believe that they are damned and lost
without Christ: he thereby commands all men to acknowledge their sins, and their need of Christ, and in effect commands all men to re∣pent, that they may believe in him. And who∣soever do refuse to repent of their by-gone sins are guilty of disobedience to this Command given to all hearers, but especially to those that are within the visible Church, for this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Iesus Christ▪ saith he. 4. That he who obyeth this Command∣ment, hath built his salvation on a solid ground. For first, he hath found the promi∣sed Messiah, compleatly furnished with all per∣fections unto the perfect execution of the Of∣fices of Prophet, Priest, and King; for he is that Christ in whom the man doth believe. 2. He hath embraced a Saviour who is able to save to the uttermost; yea, and who doth ef∣fectually save every one that cometh to God through him: for he is Jesus the true Saviour of his people from their sins. 3. He that obey∣eth this command, hath buit his salvation on the Rock, that is, on the Son of God, to whom it is no robbery to be called equal to the Fa∣ther, and who is worthy to be the object of sa∣ving Faith and of Spiritual Worship, for this is his command (saith he) that we believe in the Name of his Son Iesus Christ. 5. That he who hath believed on Jesus Christ (though he be freed from the curse of the Law) is not freed from the Command
and obedience of the Law, but tyed thereun∣to by a new obligation, and a new command from Christ: Which new command from Christ importeth help to obey the com∣mand, unto which command from Christ, the Father addeth his authority and command also; for this i his commandment (saith John) that we believe on the Name of his Son Iesus Christ, and love one another, as he hath Command∣ded us. The first part of which command en∣joyning belief in him▪ necessarily implyeth love to God, and so obedience to the first tabe, for believing in God, and loving God are in∣separable. And the second part of the command injoyneth love to our neighbour, (especially to the houshold of faith) and so obedience unto the second Table of the Law. Hence may a weak believer strengthen him∣self by reasoning from this ground after this manner. Whosoever in the sense of his own sinfulness and fear of Gods wrath, at the command of God, is fled to Iesus Christ the only remedy of sin and mi∣sry and hath ingaged his heart to the obedience of the Law of Love, his Faith is not presumptu∣ous or dead, but true and saving Faith. But I (may the weak believer say) in the sense of my own sinfulness and fear of Gods wrath am fled to Iesus Christ the only remedy of sin and misery, and have ingaged my heart to the obedi∣ence of the Law of Love.
Therefore my faith is not a presumtuous and dead faith, but true and saving faith. The fourth warrant and specal mo∣tive to believe in Christ is much as∣surance of life given, in case men shall obey the command of believing, and a fearful certification, of destruction, in case they obey not: holden forth, Ioh. 3.35. THe Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. ver. 36 He that be∣lieveth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. Wherein are holden forth to us these five following Doctrines, 1. That the Father is well satisfied with the undertakings of the Son, entered Redeemer and Surety to pay the ransom of believers, and to perfect them in holiness and salvation. The Father loveth the Son, saith he, viz. As he standeth Mediator in our name, undertaking to perfect our Redemption in all points. The Father loveth him, that is, doth heartily accept his offer to do the work, and is well pleased with him: his soul delighteth in him and resteth upon him, and maketh him in this his Office, the receptacle of love and grace and good will, to be conveyed by him to believers in him.
2. That for fulfilling of the Covenant of Redemption, the Father hath given to the Son, (as he standeth in the capacity of the Media∣tor) or as he is God incarnate, (the word made flesh) all authority in Heaven and Earth, all furniture of the riches of grace, and of spirit and life with all power, and ability, which the Union of the Divine Nature with the Humane; or which the fulness of the Godhead, dwel∣ling substantially in his Humane Nature, or which the indivisible all-sufficiency and om∣nipotey of the inseparable, every where pre∣sent Trini doh import; or the work of Re∣deption ca equire; the Father (saith he) hath given al higs into the Sons hand, to wit, for accoplhing his work. 3.  assurance of life is holden forth to all, who shall heartily receive Christ and the offer of the Covenant of grace and reconcilia∣tion through him, he that believeth on the Son (saith he) hath everlasting life, for it is made fast unto him, 1. In Gods purpose, and ir∣revocable decree, as the believer is a man elected to life. 2. By effectual calling of him unto life by God, who as he is faithful, so will he do it. 3. By promise and everlasting Co∣venant, sworn by God to give the believer strong consolation in life and death upon im∣mutable grounds. 4. By a pawn and infest∣ment under the great Seal of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, so oft as the believer shall come to receive the symbols and pledges of
life. 5. In Christ the fountain and head of life, who is entred in a possession, as atturney for believers, in whom our life is so laid up, that it cannot be taken away. 6. By begun possession of spiritual life and regeneration, and a Kingdom consisting in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, erected within the believer, as arles of the full possession of ever∣lasting life. 4. A fearful certification is given, if a man receive not the Doctrine concerning righte∣ousness and eternal life to be had by Jesus Christ: he that believes not the Son, shall not see life, that is, not so much as understand what it meaneth. 5. He further certifieth, that if a man re∣ceive not the Doctrine of the Son of God, he shall be burdened twice with the wrath of God once as a born rebel by nature, he shall bear the curse of the Law, or the Covenant of Works; and next, he shall endure a greater condemna∣tion, in respect that light being come into the world, and offered to him, he hath rejected it, and loveth darkness rather than light, and this double wrath shall be fastned and fixed im∣moveably upon him, so long as he remaineth in the condition of misbelief, the wrath of God abideth on him, saith he. Hence may the weak believer strengthen his faith by reasoning from this ground after this manner.
Whosoever believeth the Doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and findeth himself partly drawn powerfully to believe him, by the sight of life in im, and partly driven by the fear of Gods wrath to adhere unto him, may be sure of right and in∣terest to life eternal through him. But, sinful and unworthy I, (may the weak be∣liever say) do believe the Doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and do feel my self partly drawn powerfully to believe in him, by the sight of life in him; and partly driven, by the fear of Gods wrath to adhere unto him. Therefore I may be sure of my right and interest unto eternal life through him. The evidences of true Faith. SO much for the laying the grounds of faith and warrants to believe: now for evi∣dencing of true faith by fruits, these four things are requisite. 1. That the believer be sound∣ly convinced in his judgment, of this obli∣gation to keep the whole moral Law, all the days of his life: And that not the less, but so much the more, as he is delivered by Christ from the Covenant of Works, and curse of the Law. 2. That he endeavour to grow in the exercise and daily practice of Godliness and righteousness. 3. That the course of his new obe∣dience run in the right channel, that is, through faith in Christ, and through a good con∣science, to all the duties of love toward God and
man. 4. That he keep strait communion with the fountain Christ Jesus, from whom grace must run along for furnishing of good fruits. For the first, viz. To convince the believer, in his judgement, of his obligation to keep the Moral Law, among many passages, take Matth. 5.16. LEt your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. ver. 17. Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Pro∣phets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. ver. 18. For verily I say unto you, till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfiled. ver. 19. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. ver. 20. For I say unto you, that except your righ∣teousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Wherein our Lord, 1. Giveth commandment to believers, justified by faith, to give evidence of the grace
of God in them, before men, by doing good works. Let your light so shine before men (saith he) that they may see your good works. 2. He induceth them so to do, by shewing that albeit they be not justified by works; yet spectators of their good works may be con∣verted or edified, and so glory may redound to God by their good works, when the wit∣nesses thereof shall glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. 3. He gives them no other rule for their new obedience, than the Moral Law, set down, and explicated by Moses and the Prophets. Think not (saith he) that I am come to destroy the Law, and the Prophets. 4. He gives them to understand that the Doctrine of grace, and freedom from the curse of the Law, by faith in him, is readily mistaken by mens corrupt judgment, as if it did loose or slaken the obligation of believers to obey the commands, and to be subject to the authority of the Law, and that this error is indeed a destroying of the Law and of the Prophets, which he will in no case ever en∣dure in any of his Disciples, it is so contrary to the end of his coming, which is first to sanctifie, and then to save believers. Think not (saith he) that I am come to destroy the Law, and the Prophets. 5. He teacheth, that the end of the Gospel and Covenant of Grace, is to procure mens obedience unto the Moral Law, I am come
(saith he) to fulfil the Law, and the Prophets. 6. That the obligation of the Moral Law, it all points, unto all holy duties, is perpetual and shall stand to the worlds end, that is, till Heaven and Earth pass away. 7. That as God hath a care of the Scriptures from the beginning, so shall he have care of them still to the Worlds end, that there shall not one jot or one title of the substance thereof be taken away, so saith the Text, v. 11. 8. That as the breaking of the Moral Law, and defending the transgression thereof to be no sin, doth exclude men both from Heaven, and justly also from the fellowship of the true Kirk, so the obedience of the Law and teaching others to do the same, by example, counsel and doctrine, according to every mans calling, proveth a man to be a true believer, and in great estimation with God, and worthy to be much esteemed of by the true Church, v. 19. 9. That the righteousness of every true Chri∣stian, must be more than the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; for the Scribes and Pharisees, albeit they took great pains to dis∣charge sundry duties of the Law, yet they cut∣ted short the exposition thereof: that it might the less condemn the practice, they studied the outward part of the duty, but neglected the inward and spiritual part: they discharged meaner duties carefully, but neglected judg∣ment, mercy and the love of God: In a word, they went about to establish their own righ∣teousness,
and rejected the Righteousness of God by faith in Jesus. But a true Christian must have more than all this, he must acknow∣ledg the full extent of the spiritual meaning of the Law, and have a respect to all the Com∣mandments, and labour to cleanse himself from all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, and not lay weight upon what service he hath done, or shall do, but cloath himself with the imputed righ∣teousness of Christ: which only can hide his nakedness, or else he cannot be saved. So saith the Text, Except your righteousness, &c. The second thing requisite to evidence true Faith, is that the believer en∣deavour to put the rules of Godli∣ness and Righteousness in practice, and to grow in the daily exercise thereof: holden forth, 2 Pet. 1.5. ANd besides this giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, ver. 6. And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience godliness: ver. 7. And to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. ver. 8. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barre nor unfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ. Wherein, 1. The Apostle teacheth belie∣vers,
for evidencing of pious faith in them∣selves, to endeavour to add to their faith seven other sister graces: the first is Vertue, or the active exercise and practice of all Moral du∣ties, that so faith may not be idle, but put forth it self in work. The second is Knowledge, which serveth to furnish Faith with information of the truth to be believed; and to furnish Vertue with direction what duties are to be done, and how to go about them prudently. The third is Temperance, which serveth to moderate the use of all pleasant things, that a man be not clog∣ed therewith, nor made unfit for any duty, whereto he is called. The fourth is Patience, which serveth to moderate a mans affections, when he meeteth wih any difficulty or un∣pleasant thing, that he neither weary for pains required in well doing, nor faint when the Lord chastiseth him, nor murmur when he crosseth him. The fifth is Godliness, which may keep him up in all exercises of Religion, inward and outward, whereby he may be furnished from God, for all other duties which he hath to do. The sixth is Brotherly kindness, which keepeth estimation of, and affection to, all the houshold of Faith, and to the image of God in every one wheresoever it is seen. The seventh is Love, which keepeth the heart in readiness to do good to all men, whosoever they be, upon all occasions which God shall offer. 2. Albeit it be true, that there is much cor∣ruption and infirmity in the godly, yet the A∣postle
will have men uprightly endeavouring, and doing their best, as they are able to joyn all these graces one to another, and to grow in the measure of exercising of them: giving all diligence (saith he) add to your saith, &c. 3. He assureth all professed believers, that as they shall profit in the obedience of this di∣rection, so they shall Profitably prove the soundness of their own faith, and if they want these graces, that they shall be found blind de∣ceivers of themselves, ver. 9. The third thing requisite to evidence true faith is, that obedience to the Law run in the right channel, that is through faith in Christ, &c. holden forth, 1 Tim. 1.5. NOw the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience and of saith unfaigned. Wherein the Apostle teacheth these seven Doctrines. 1. That the obedience of the Law must flow from love, and love from a pure heart, and a pure heart from a good Conscience, and a good conscience from Faith unfaigned, this he maketh the only right channel of good works, the end of the Law is Love, &c. 2. That the end of the Law is not that men may be justified by their obedience of it,
as the Jewish Doctors did falsly teach: for it is impossible that sinners can be justified by the Law, who for every transgression are condemn∣ed by the Law: for the end of the Law is (not such as the Jewish Doctors taught, but) love out of a pure heart, &c. 3. That the true end of the Law, preached unto the people, is that they, by the Law, being made to see their deserved condemnation, should flie to Christ unfaignedly, to be justified by faith in him: So saith the Text, while it mak∣eth love to flow through faith in Christ. 4. That no man can set himself in love to o∣bey the Law, except in as far as his conscience is quieted by faith, or is seeking to be quieted in Christ, for the end of the Law is love of a good conscience, and faith unfaigned. 5. That faigned faith goeth to Christ with∣out reckoning with the Law, and so wants an errand; but unfaigned faith reckoneth with the Law, and is forced to flie for refuge unto Christ as the end of the Law, for righteousness so often as it finds it self guilty for breaking of the Law: For the end of the Law is faith unfaigned. 6. That the fruits of love may come forth in act particularly it is necessary, that the heart be brought to the hatred of all sin and unclean∣ness, and to a stedfast purpose to follow all ho∣liness universal; for the end of the Law is love out of a pure heart. 7. That unfaigned fith is able to make the conscience good, and the heart pure, and the
man lovingly obedient to the Law; for when Christs blood is seen by faith to quiet justice, then the conscience becometh quiet also, and will not suffer the heart to entertain the love of sin, but sets the man on work to fear God for his mercy, and to obey all his command∣ments out of love to God for his free gift of justification by grace bestowed on him: For this is the end of the Law indeed, whereby it ob∣taineth of a man more obedience than any o∣ther way. The fourth thing requisite to evidence true faith is, the keeping of strait com∣munion with Christ, the fountain of all grace and of all good works: holden forth, Iohn 15.5. I Am the true vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bring∣eth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. Wherein Christ in a similitude from a vine tree teacheth us. 1. That by nature we are wild barren briers till we be changed by coming unto Christ, and that Christ is that noble vine tree having all life and sap of grace in himself, and able to change the nature of every one that cometh to him, and to communicate spirit and life to as many as shall believe in him: I am the vine
(saith he) and ye are the branches. 2 That Christ loveth to have believers so united unto him, as that they be not separated at any time by unbelief: and that there may be a mutual inhabitation of them in him by faith and love, and of him in them, by his Word and Spirit, for he joyneth these together, if ye abide in me and I in you, as things inseparable. 3. That except a man be ingrafted in Christ and united to him by faith, he cannot do any the least good work of his own strength: yea, except in as far as a man doth draw spirit and life from Christ by faith, the work which he doth is naughty and nul in the point of goodness in Gods estimation, for without me (saith he) ye can do nothing. 4. That this mutual inhabitation, is the fountain and infallible cause of constant conti∣nuing and abounding in well-doing. For he that abideth in me, and I in him (saith he) the same beareth much fruit. Now as our abiding in Christ presupposeth three things, 1. That we have heard the joyful sound of the Gospel ma∣king offer of Christ to us who are lost sinners by the Law. 2. That we have heartily em∣braced the gracious offer of Christ. 3. That by receiving of him we are become the sons of God, Iob. 1.12. And are incorporated into his Mystical body, that he may dwell in us as his temple, and we dwel in him as in the resi∣dence of righteousness and life, So our abiding in Christ importeth other three things.
1. An imploying of Christ in all our addresses to God, and in all our undertakings of what∣soever peece of service to him. 2. A content∣edness with his sufficiency, without going out from him to seek righteousness or life, or fur∣niture in any case, in our own or any of the creatures worthiness. 3. A fixedness in our believing in him, a fixedness in our imploying and making use of him, and a fixedness in our contentment in him, and adhering to him, so that no allurement, no tentation of Satan or the World, no terror nor trouble may be able to drive our spirits from firm adherence unto him; or from constant avowing of his truth and obeying his commands, who hath loved us and given himself for us: and in whom not only our life is laid up, but also the fulness of the God-head dwelleth bodily, by reason of the substantial and personal union of the Divine and Humane nature in him. Hence let every watchful Believer, for strengthning himself in faith and obedience, reason after this manner. WHosoever doth daily imploy Christ Iesus for cleansing his conscience and affecti∣ons from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the Law, and for making of him to give evidence of true faith in himself. But I (may every watchful believer say) do
daily imploy Jesus Christ for cleansing my con∣science and affections from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the Law, & for enabling of me to give obedience to the Law in love. Therefore I have the evidence of true faith in my self. And hence also let the sleepy and sluggish believer reason, for his own up-stirring thus. Whatsoever is necessary for giving evidence of true faith, I must study to do it, except would deceive my self and perish. But to imploy Christ Jesus daily for clean∣sing of my conscience and affections from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the Law, and for enabling of me to give obedience to the Law in love, is necessary for evidencing of true faith in me. Therefore this I must study to do, except I would deceive my self and perish. And lastly, seeing Christ himself hath poin∣ted this fourth as an undoubted evidence of a man elected of God unto life, and given to Jesus Christ to be redeemed, if he come unto him, that is, close Covenant and keep communion with him, as he teacheth us, Iohn 6.37. Saying, All that the Father hath given me, shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. Let every person who doth not in earnest make use of Christ, for remission of sin and amendment of life, reason hence, and from the whole premisses, after this manner, that his con∣science may be wakned.
Whosoever is neither by the Law nor by the Gospel so convinced of sin, righteousness and judgment, as to make him come to Christ and imploy him daily for remission of sin and amendment of life, he wanteth not only all evidence of saving faith, but also all appearance of his election, so long as he remaineth in this condition. But I (may every impenitent person say) am neither by the Law nor Gospel convinced of sin, righteousness and judgment, as to make me come to Christ and imploy him daily for remission of sin and amendment of life Therefore I want not only all the evidence of saving faith, but also all appearance of my election, so long as I remain in this condition. FINIS.
