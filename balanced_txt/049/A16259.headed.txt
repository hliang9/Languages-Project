PRynce of Salerne somtyme was one Tācerde A noble man gentyll lowly and sage Greatly praysed for his manhode and ded Yf he had not take vengeaunce in his age Of two louers / done by his fell courage For they loued eche other tenderly By cruell meane he caused them to dy ¶This noble man had neuer other chylde But a doughter of excellent beaute Prudent in her youthe sage and nothynge wylde Her father loued her ryght tenderly So lothe he was to lese her company That no man coude haue her in maryage Tyll that she was aboue her lawfull age ¶Sygysmonde was the name of this lady whiche was wedded with her faders counseyle Vnto the dukes sone of Campany But in shorte tyme after theyr espousayle Dethe with his darte her husbande dyd assayle After whose dethe she dyd not longe soiourne But to her father she dyd home retourne
¶Of shape and persone she was well fourmed Her face and coloure fayre and amyable Nature in beauty her so fornysshed That none to her was equiperable Her maner and wysdome commendable In all her dedes she was excellent More than to woman is expedyent ¶In her faders house she longe soiournynge In welthe and ease and greate prosperyte Her faders mynde whan she had perceyuynge How he in her had suche felycyte That to mary her he wolde not agre And how it sholde be shame for hym to requyre To accomplysshe her pleasure and desyre ¶Wherfore she concluded in her mynde Some gentyll man for her louer to chose whiche wolde vnto her be secret and kynde with whome she myght her pleasure somtyme vse The chaunce of loue she coude no wyse refuse Cupyde so sore her herte had set on fyre That nede she must accomplysshe her desyre ¶Of nobles and other of meane degre Her faders house was greatly fornysshed As noble housholders are wont for to be Sygysmonde theyr maners oft regarded Amonge whome one out she had espyed Vertuous / humble / stedfast / prew / and sage How be it he was but of small lygnage

¶Guystarde than toke the foresayd rede Sayenge he wolde soone do her commaundement But in his thought he well ymagyned It was not gyuen hym but for some entent wherfore vnto his chambre he forth went And brake the rede / wherin he dyd espy The letter enclosed ryght secretly ¶Whan that he had ouer red the byll well wherin her purpose he had perceyued He was so mery that no tongue can tell The ioye whiche his herte had supprysed For it was the thynge he moost desyred wherfore he agreed her mynde to fulfyll Accordynge to the tenoure of the byll ¶R.

THere was a caue ioynynge vnto the place whiche was out of mānes remembraūce past For it was not vsed of longe space On the toppe therof in lyght for to cast There was an hole whiche wos so olde and wast That thornes and breres dyd it ouer growe So that the entre therof none myght knowe
¶And from the caue there was a secrete way whiche of no creature was espyed Vnto the chambre where as Sygysmonde lay The way therof so longe was dysused The dore of the sayd caue was fast barred whiche passage was stopped so secretly That harde it was the encrynge to espye ¶Sygysmonde by the secrete introduccyon Of loue from whose eyes nothynge can be hyd Of the sayd caue she founde the entrynge soone And in to it alone she descended Bothe length and depnesse she well regarded And to Guystarde she made therof reporte By wrytynge how he myght to her resorte ¶Guystarde of this beynge aduertysed Ordred all thynge mete to his besynesse A ledder cote for hym he deuysed From thornes and breres to kepe hym harmelesse And in the nyght thyder he dyd hym dresse And by a rope in to the caue dyd slyde And there for her all nyght he dyd abyde ¶In the mornynge whan the day gan to appere Sygysmonde caused to auoyde by a trayne The maydes whiche lay within her chambere Sayenge that nyght she coude not slepe for payne And quyetly than to rest she wolde fayne And after them she locked fast the dore Of her purpose she thought she wolde be sure

¶He came vnto her chambre on a day whyle she was with her maydens in the gardyne He seynge that she was besy in play Besyde her bedde he dyd hym selfe declyne Afore his face he dyd drawe the curtyne A soft pylowe vnder his heed he cast His wery body fell a slepe full fast Sygysmonde before her chambre wyndowes shyt For with Guystarde she had made apoyntment The same day to haue a mery fyt And whan she thought her tyme conuenyent Out of the gardyne secretly she went And vnto her chambre she resorted And after her the dore she fast locked ¶She not knowynge her father there a slepe The caue dore she opened with her kay And caused Guystarde out of it to crepe And on the bedde as they were wont alway Of Venus they vsed the sporte and play So that by noyse and wordes that they dyd make Tancrede her father out of his slepe dyd wake ¶Tancrede from his slepe moued sodeynly All theyr pastyme he well aduertysed At the fyrst tyme he dyd thynke for to crye But in hym selfe he well delybered By sylence his mynde sholde be better sped And that he myght with delyberacyon Vpon them bothe take iust correccyon
¶Where from noyse he kept hym selfe full close These louers whan they had done theyr pleasure With glad semblaunt they bothe from ye bedde rose The dede they thought ryght secrete and sure In to the caue whiche was depe and obscure Guystarde went in as he was wont to do And Sygysmonde dyd to her maydens go ¶R.

TAncrede for this chaunce beynge troubled From the chambre secretly dyd yssue And with watche men the caue he enclosed within the nyght Guystarde for to pursue As he came oute they toke this louer true In his ledder cote as he was clothed Before Tancrede they haue hym presented ¶Tancrede vnto hym spake thus cruelly Guystarde my kyndnesse hath not deserued That thou sholde do to me this vylany whiche with myne eyen this day I espyed I haue alwaye the greatly fauoured Thou hast dyshonoured me by thyne offence For kyndnesse shame thou doest me recompence
¶The true louer answered pyteously Vnto Tancrede sayenge syr for certayne The harde chaunce of loue no man can deny It is greater than is the power humayne From it I coude my selfe in no wyse refrayne Your puyssaunce may not vnto loue compare Loue is so greate that it wyll no man spare ¶This prynce for this beynge full of sorowe Commaunded hym to be kept in prysone And after dyner on the nexte morowe Vnto his doughters chambre he went ryght soone All were auoyded saue they two alone with heuy chere thus vnto her he sayd whiche knewe nothynge her councell was bewrayd ¶Sygysmonde I haue ben longe dysceyued By your honest vertu and sadde prudence whiche vnto me so stedfast appered That in you I had so greate confydence Thynkynge ye wolde neuer do suche offence No man coude haue made me it to byleue Yf with myne eyes the dede I dyd not preue ¶Thy heynous trespace doth my herte sore greue whiche contynually is in my thought That the small tyme whiche I haue to leue In sorowe to ende thou hast it now brought At leest yf thou had mynded to be nought Thou sholde haue taken one to thy degre Conuenyent the lesse the faute had be
