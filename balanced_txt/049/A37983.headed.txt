THe Lords and Commons in Par∣liament, holding their former resolution, That all notorious and scandalous Offenders shalbe kept from the Sacrament, have thought fit to make a further addition to the scandalous Offences formerly enumerated, for which men shall bee kept

Lords and Commons, to adjudge and deter∣mine scandalous offences not formerly enume∣rated, and the Elderships shall proceed in the Examinations of such scandalous offences accor∣ding to the causions and restrictions mentioned in the Ordinance of the twentieth of October, 1645. And the said Committee shall have such power, and shall proceed in such sort as is here∣after mentioned. If any notorious and scandalous offence not formerly enumerated be committed by any within any Eldership, and so after full proofe shall be found before the Eldership, who shall have power to examine Proofs and Witnesses on both sides, in case both the Eldership and the party complained of do agree, the Proofs and Examinations to be duly taken, the said Elder∣ship shall forthwith certifie the said Offence, with the Proofs, to the said Committee of Par∣liament, who shall with all convenient speed determine and adjudge the same; But in case the party accused shall finde himselfe grieved, either by the not examination or undue exami∣nation of Witnesses, or mis-entring of the De∣positions,
in such case he shall forth with declare the same to the Eldership, who shall relieve him if there be cause, which if they shall not do, then the three Justices of Peace next to the Pa∣rish whereof the party complained of is a Mem∣ber, or any two of them, not being of the same Eldership before whom the Complaint lyes, shall have power, and are hereby inabled and re∣quired forthwith to examine upon Oath the said Witnesses that were not examined, or were mis-examined, or whose Depositions were mis∣entred, and with all convenient speed returne the Examination to the said Committee of Par∣liament: And in case the said Justices, or any two of them, do not finish their Examination, within six daies after the Cause shall be present∣ed to them, the Party shall abstaine untill they have finished and certified their Examinations; And the said Committee upon hearing the whole matter from the Eldership and Justices, or either of them, shall adjudge whether the same be a notorious and scandalous offence, and so proved or no. And in case the said Commit∣tee shall not adjudge and determine the Case
within fourteen daies after the receipt of the Certificate to them made, the party against whom the said Certificate shall be made, shall abstaine from the Sacrament, untill the Com∣mittee shall determine the same, unlesse in the meane time the party shall shew his repentance for the said offence, and thereof give satisfacti∣on to the Eldership; And if the said Committee shall adjudge the same not to be a scandalous Offence, or not well proved, the said party shall be admitted to the Sacrament; and if they shall adjudge the same to be a scandalous Offence, and so proved, he shall not be admitted to the Sacrament untill he shall have testified his repen∣tance to the Eldership. And be it further Ordained, That the El∣dership shall either give personall notice to the Party complained of before them, or else leave notice in writing at his dwelling place, of the time and place when and where they will exa∣mine Witnesses against him, and also of the time that they will make their Certificate to the Committee of Parliament. And in case informa∣tion shall be given to the Eldership of a notori∣ous
and scandalous offence committed by any within their Eldership, they shall forthwith pro∣ceed to the Examination thereof; And if they cannot finish their Examination till the week be∣fore the Sacrament, and they shall then finde by sufficient proof that he hath committed a noto∣rious and scandalous Offence, and yet they can∣not certifie the same before the Sacament, it be∣ing to be administred within a week after, in such case the party shall abstaine from the Sa∣crament for the next time onely, unlesse the Committee of Parliament, to whom the same is to be certified, shall adjudge the same a notori∣ous and scandalous offence, and so proved; for which he ought to be kept from the Sacrament: and in such case, upon the testifying of his re∣pentance to the Eldership, he shall be againe re∣stored to the Sacrament, and not before. And be it further Ordained, If any shall finde themselves agrieved with the judgement against him given by the said Committee, they shall appeale from thence to both Houses of Par∣liament, if they see cause. And be it Ordained, That the Committee
to whom the said Certificate shall be made, as aforesaid, shall report to both Houses the said severall Cases to them certified, and their judge∣ments thereupon, that so the Offences not yet enumerated may be added to the enumeration, in case the Houses shall so think sit, and in their Reports they shall take care that they first report those Certificates and their opinions thereupon, wherein they at any time shall differ from the Eldership. And be it further Ordained, That this Ordi∣nance shall continue for the space of three yeers, and no longer, unlesse both Houses think fit to continue it. Ioh. Brown Cler. Parliamentorum. FINIS.
