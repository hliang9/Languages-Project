¶Vnto the reader gra¦ce and peace in Christ. EMong other innumerabill pesti∣lent infections of bokes and ler∣nynges / with whiche the Christē haue byn pytuously seduced & de∣ceyued (brought vp in dyuers kīdes of dif∣fidence and false hope) I may iudge / & that chyefly / those to be pernycious / of whome they are wont in euery place to pray / and haue also lerned by harte / both curyously & with greate scrupulosite to make reher∣sall of theyre synnes. These bokes (though they abounded in euery place with infini∣te erroures / & taught prayers / made with wicked folysshenesse / both to god / and also to his sayntes / yet by cause they were gar∣nyshed with glorious titles and with red¦de lettres promisinge moche grace and par¦don (though it were but vanyte) haue sore deceyued the vnlerned multitude one is called the garden of the soule an other the paradise of the soule / and by cause I will be short loke thou thy sylfen whate dyuers and tryfeling names be gyuen vnto thei Wherfore here nedeth sharpe reformacion
ye and many of theym are worthy to be vt∣terly distroyed. The same iugement and reformation is also to be had of the bokes of passions and sayntes lyues called legendes for in these also are many thinges added wherof Sa∣tan is author howbeyt syth nether tyme suf¦ficient is gyuen to one man nether the but thom of this reformacyon of one may be susteyned I thought it ynough / in this pla∣ce a lonely to haue monysshed you trusting that god in tyme comyng shall adde to the∣se thynges both tyme conuenient and also lyght. Therfore here (as entring my moter) first I wil declare after a syngle & playn maner (by, the whiche euē as by a glasse) thou shalt knowe whate the knowelege of synne is & howe we ought truely to praye folowing the rehersall of the cōmaundementes and of the Pater noster. And I doute not but this one prayer is sufficiēt ynough to the∣ym that prayer howe of them so euer it be or whate so euer they require ye yf they ta∣ke but one lytell part of it whiche so euer it be / for a good prayer is not set ī the mul¦titude of wordes as Cirst sayeth in the syx¦te
of Mathewe. But here stondith the pith that thou syghe to god ofte from the botō of thyne hart for to haue streynght to do his wyll and to fulfyll his commaunde∣mentes. And this syghe ought to endure contynually. Therfore I desyre all persones that frō hensforth they forget suche prayers as ar saynt Brygittes & other lyke / whiche grea∣te promyses and perdons haue falsly aua∣unced from whome you shall retourne vn¦to this simple prayer nedefull for euery chri¦sten / whose common vse doth yet perseuer emong all men / yf they dyd vnderstond it / and applyed theyr myndes to it. Suche ver¦tue hath the Pater noster / that the lenge and the more thou vse it / the swetter and more acceptable it is. Which I desyre that the master of this prayer confyrme Iesus Chryst whiche is blyssed eter∣nally. Amen.
¶The symbole or Crede of the great doc∣tour Athanasius dayly red in the Churche WHo soeuer wyll be saued / before all thinges it is necessary that he holde the trewe Catholyke fayth Which fayth / but yf euery mā will kepe hole and inuiolate / without dout he shall eternally perysshe. This truly is the verye Catholyke faythe that we worsshyp one God in trinite / and the trinite in vnite. Neyther confoundyng the persones / ney∣ther seperatinge the substance. The persone of the Father is one / the per¦son of the sone an other / the person of the holye Ghoste an other. But of the Father / of the sone / and of the holy ghost / there is one diuinite / equal glo¦ry / coeternall maiestye. Suche as is the Father / suche is the Son¦ne / suche is the holy Ghoste. The Father is vncreate / the Sone vn∣creat / the holy Ghost is vncreat. The father is without measure / the Son without measure / the holy Ghost without measure. The Father is euerlastynge / the sone euer¦lastyng / the holy Ghost euerlastyng.
And not with standyng there be not .iij. euerlastyng / but one euerlastyng. Euyn as there be not thre vncreat: nor ii. vnmesurate / but one vncreat / and one vnmesurate. Lykewyse the father is almyghty / the son almyghty / and the holy Ghoste almyghty. And yet they be not thre Almyghtes / but one God almyghty. So the Father is God / the Sonne God / the holy Ghost is God. And yet they be not .iij. goddes / but one God. So the Father is a lorde / the Sone a lor¦de / the holy Ghost a lorde. And yet they be not .iij. Lordes / but one Lorde. For as we be compelled by the Chrysty / and veryte to confesse seperatly euery one person to be God and lorde. So are we prohybite by the Catholyke re¦lygyon of Chrystes fayth to say that there be .iij. goddes or thre lordes. The father is made of none / neyther crea¦ted nor gotten. The Sone is from the Father alone: ney¦ther made ne create / but gotten.
The holy ghost is from the father / and the Sone / neyther made created nor gotten but procedynge. And so there is but one Father / not thre Fathers / one Sonne / not thre Sonnes / o¦ne holy ghoste / not thre holy ghostes. And in this trinyte / there is none before or after another / nothynge more or lesse but all the thre persons be coeterne / & coe∣quall to them selfe. So that by always as now it hath ben a∣boue sayd / the trinyte in vnyte / & the vnyte in trinite may we worshypper. He therfore that wyll be saued / let hym vnderstande thus of the trinite. But it is necessary vnto euerlastynge he∣alth / that euery christian beleue also fayth∣fully the incarnacyon of oure Lorde Iesu Chryste. It is therfore the ryght fayth: that we be leue confesse that our lorde Iesu Chryste the Sone of God / is God and man. He is God by the substāce of the Father goten before all worldes / and he is man by the substance of his mother / borne in the worlde. Perfyte God / perfyte man / beynge of a
soule reasonable / and of flesshe humayne, Equall to the Father by his godhed lesse then the Father by his manhed. Whiche thoughe he be God and man / yet is there not twayne but one Chryste. Truely he is one not by turnyng of his godhed in to manhed / but by assumptynge of his manhed in to godhed. Beynge out to all intentes / not by confu¦syon of substance / but by vnite of person. For as the reasonable soule & the flesshely body is or maketh one man / so God and man is one Chryste. Whiche suffered death for our saluacyon descended to helle / and rose from death the thyrde daye. Whiche ascended to heuens / sytteth at the ryght hande of God the Father almyghty frō thense shall he come to iudge the quyc∣ke and dead. At whose comynge all men muste ryse with theyr bodyes: & shall gyue accompt of theyr owne propre dedes. And they that haue done well shall go in to euerlastyng lyfe / they that haue done e∣uyll in to euerlastynge fyre. This is the Catholyke sayth / whiche ex∣cepte
euery man faythfully / and stedfastly do beleue he can not be saued. ¶Finis. ¶The offyce of all Estates. i. Timothe .iij.

Ye shall not deceyue youre brethren: nei¦ther with weyght nor measure / but shall haue true balances / and true weyghtes / for I am the Lorde your God.
¶Husbandes. Ephe. v ¶Husbandes loue your wyues euen as Chryst loued the congregacyon / and gaue hym selfe for it to sanctyfy it and clensed it in the foūtayne of water thorowe the wor¦de / to make it vnto hym selfe / a gloryous congregacyon with out spot or wrencle / or any suche thinge. So ought men to loue theyr wyues / as theyr owne bodyes. He that loueth his wyfe / loueth hym selfe. For no man euer yet hated his owne flesshe / but norrysshed it, &c. ¶Wyues. Ephe. v. Wyues submit youre selues to your ow¦ne husbandes / as to the lorde. For the hus∣bande is te wyues heed / euen as Chryst is the heed of the congregacyon. Therfore as the cōgregacyō is in subiection to Chryste lykewyse lette the wyues be in subiectyon to theyr husbandes in all thynges. ¶Fathers and Mothers. Ephe. v. Ye fathers moue not your chyldren vnto wrath but brynge them vp with the nurtu¦re and informacyon of the lorde. ¶Chyldren. Ephe. vi. Chyldren obey youre fathers & mothers in the Lorde: for so it is ryght, Honour the
Father and mother (that is the fyrst com∣maundement that hathe any promyse) that thou mayste be in good estate and lyue lon¦ge on the earthe. Maysters. Colles .iij.

¶The Preface. IT was neuer ordeyned without the singular prouidence of God / that the multitude of Christē shul¦de lerne be herte the tenne com∣maundementes / the Credo / and the Pater¦noster. For truely he that vnderstondeth these / hath the pythe af all those thynges / whiche holy scripture doth conteyne or what so euer may be taught necessary vn∣to the Christen / and that purely and copy∣ously / bysides that so briefly & clerely / that no man can complayne or excuse hym sylfe iustely / syth that (whiche is required to the blyssed lyfe) is nether ouer tedious / nor yet so harde but it may be perfourmed. Three thinges there are necessary to be knowen to obteyne eternall lyfe. ¶The fyrst is that thou knowe whate is expedient to be done / and whate to be vndone. The seconde / when thou percea∣uest that thou of thy nowne strenght canst nether do / nether yet auoyde that / whiche thou art bounde to do / or to eschewe / that then thou knowe of whome to seke / fynde and receyue this streyngth. The thyrde is / howe thou shuldest seke / and obteyne it.
And herunto I wyll gyue the an ensample to thintent that thou mayst the more euy∣dently perceaue it. A man whiche is disea∣sed with any maner of sykenesse / fyrst enqui¦reth with what kinde of syckenesse he is in¦fect / and then cōsydereth he what streyngth he hath what he is able to do and what he can not do them sercheth he for a me dicyne to ley to his decease so that by this meanes he may get his helth / and that he may after¦ward be able to do and leaue vndone all thynges as the hole. Finally when he hath founde this medecine he wilt take it & vse it. Lykewise the cōmaundementes of God do teache a man to knowe his infirmyte that he maye vnderstonde and seale what he can do & what he can not / what he can leaue & wath he cā not so that he may know¦ledge hīsylf a vicious {per}son & a sinner. After he hath knoweleged him sylf / so that thē he may lerne by faith where to finde remedy & grace wherby he may be restored & iustified and so may be abyll to fulfill the cōmaun∣dementes. For fayth plainly declareth god and his mercy shewed & gyuen in Christ. But the pater noster doth teache howe we shulde desyre fayth / and obteyne this boun¦teous
fauoure as in a well ordered meke and faythfull prayer whiche getteth al the¦se thinges so that fulfylling the cōmaunde¦mentes of god we may be saued and made blessed. Wherfore (as I haue sayd) in these thre consysteth the hole scripture. Wherfore it is expedyent to begyn at the commaundementes so that we may by thē lerne to knowelege oure synne and maly∣ce (as the spirituall infirmite) whiche ma∣keth vs feable and weake so that we can nether do nether leaue that whiche we a∣re bounde to do or to leaue. ¶ The tenne commaundementes. THe fyrst and most excellent table of Moyses conteyneth thre com∣maundementes / and doth shewe vnto vs whate we owe to God / that is to sey / whate we ought to do or to eschewe / concernyng those thinges whiche specially pertyne vnto God. Therfore in the first of all the cōmaundemētes / we are taught what god requyreth in euery man∣nes hert / and what man ought to iudge & thynke of hym / that is that he loke euer for the best of hī / euen as of a father or of a spe¦cial frend / & that with out doutyng or any
mistrust / with cōstant faythe / truste / & loue euer fearyng to displease hym / euen as kin¦de chyldren feare to displease theyre natu∣rall fathers. For very nature doth teache that there is one God / of whome all oure goodnesse spryngeth whiche is our socoure in all aduersite for this dyd the hethen gra¦unt vnto theyr ydolles. ¶The wordes of this commaun¦dement are these. ¶Thou shalt haue no straunge goddes. THe seconde precepte teacheth vs ho∣we we ought to ordre oure selfe to¦wardes god / as cōcerning oure outwarde workes before men / or elles inwardly in oure owne cōscience / whiche is that we ho¦noure the name of god / for no man can she we God as he is in his owne nature / ne∣ther to hym selfe / nether yet to any other but by his onely name. ¶The wordes of this cōmaundement are these. Thou shalt not take the name of god in vayne. THe thyrd precept doth shewe howe we ought to behaue oure self towar¦des god in outward workes / and in wur∣schippyng hym. The wordes are these.
¶Thou shalt kepe holy the saboth day. HEre mayst thou se how in these thre preceptes a man is taught to ordre hī silf towardes God in his vnderstonding / thoughtes of the hart wordes and workes that is to say thorough out all his lyfe. ¶The seconde Table. ¶The second and laste Table of Moy¦ses cōteyneth .vij. preceptes folowyng and this sheweth vs how we ought to behaue oure silues vnto oure neyghboure both in doyng and leuyng vndone. THe first of these doth teache vs what we are bounde to do to the hyghe of officers and suche as are in auctorite / the whiche seynge that they are sette to rule here in stede of god it is accordīg that this precept be sette next in place after those thre whiche do perteyne to god hym silft. The examples of this commaundemente are fa¦ther / mother / lorde / lady / master / and ma∣stresse. The wordes are these. ¶Thou shalt honoure thy father and mother. IN the secōde precept of this table we lerne howe we ought to lyue wt oure equalles & neyghboures & this doth chiefly
cōcerne the persone of man that we shulde hurte no man but rather with oure labou¦re and diligence to succour & promote thē. Whiche is conteyned in these wordes. ¶Thou shalt not kyll. THe thyrde passith thy neyghboures person & shewith whate thou shuldest do concernyng his chieffe possessions as wi¦fe chyldren and kinsmen that thou nether defile nor de fame theym but that thou do thy dyligence as moche as lyeth in the to sa¦ue theyr honoure & dygnite the wordes are ¶Thou shalt not commytte aduoutrye. THe fourth treatyth of thy neyghbou¦res other mouabyll goodes teaching that thou take no thyng from hym / nor di∣minyshe nor hurte any thyng that he hath / but rather to profyt / and encreace it. The wordes are. ¶Thou shalt not steale. IN the fifte we are taught howe to or¦dre oure sylfe cōcernynge the name & good fame of oure neyghboure / neuer to sclaunder hym but to helpe and defend him as moche as lieth in vs. These are the wor¦des of it. ¶Thou shalt bere no false witnesse
ageynst thy neyboure. THerfore it is forboden vs to hurte a¦ny kinde of oure neyghboures goo∣des / but cōtrary wyfe cōmaunded that we shuld encreace theim. Nowe yf we loke on the lawe of nature / we shall sone perceyue howe merueylous / equall / good and ryght¦uous these preceptes are. For there is no∣thing cōmaunded in all these that pertey∣ne eyther to god or to oure neygh boure / but that euery man wolde that it shulde be perfourmed touward hym selfe yf he were in the stede of god or of his neyghboure, THe .ij. last preceptes do reproue & cō∣dempne vs for the wickednesse & ma¦lice of oure nature / & teache vs howe pure we ought to be / frō all desyringes of the fles¦she / & goodes carnall. Here is the stryfe / the warre / & laboure / wherin we ought to be exercised all oure lyfe / whiche .ij. cōmaun∣dementes are gyuen in these wordes. Thou shalt not desyre thy neyghbou∣res house. THou shalt not desire thy neyghbou∣res wife / seruauntes / maydens / catel and whate so euer he possessith. ¶A short conclusyon of the tenne cō∣maundementes.
¶Christ hym selfe sayeth on this maner whate so euer ye wolde that men shulde do to you / the same do you to theym. In this is comprehended the lawe and all the Prophetes. Mat .vij. THere is no man that for his greate benefites loueth to receaue vnkinde¦nesse. There is no man will gladly suffer his name to be euyll spoken of by an other There is no man whiche wilbe content to be dispysed of a proude man. Besydes that there is no man that loueth the disobe¦dyence / wrath or vnchastnesse of his wife. There is no man whiche wolde be dispoy∣led of his possessyons defrayded / deceyued / sclaundered oppressed. But rather all men are of this nature / that they had leuer be fa¦uoured loued kindely entreated holpen & trusted of theyre neyghboures whiche all are cōmaunded in these tenne preceptes. ¶Of the transgressyon of the commaundementes.

THey that ascrybe theyre trouble and aduersite / to the deuyll / or other euyl men. They that not louyngly & with glad¦de herte wyll accept prosperite and aduer¦site / good and euyll / and all thynges euen as he hath receyued theym of god to who∣me we ought to gyue all thankes whate so euer chaunce vnto vs.

They that waxe proude of ryghtuous∣nesse / cūning or other spirituall gyft. They that wurshippe god or his sayn∣tes / for tēporall goodes / forgettyn the pro∣fyttes of theyre soules.

They that regarde not the vnbelefe and mistrust of other nether bringeth theym to his power to beleue and trust in the mer∣cy of God. Of this place are all kyndes of vnbele∣fe mystrust and desperation. ¶Agenst the seconde offendeth. HE that without a cause or of a custo¦me swereth folysshely.

He that doth not honoure theim / though thy be cruell and vnryghtfull. He that obeyeth not to mastres and offi∣cers / is not trusty and faythfull to theym whether they be good or euell. ¶He that maynteyneth not this com∣maundement / nor resysteth not theym whi¦che do the contrary. Hyther conferre all

HE that is angry with his neyghboure He that sayeth vnto his neyghboure / Racha in whiche worde are conteyned all kindes of wrath & hatred.

Vnder this precept ar conteyned all the synnes of wrath / hatred / manslaughter / ba¦tayle / pylage / burnynges / fynally / of cōten∣cion strife / chydinges / enuy in the welfare of oure neyboures & reioysing of his hurte or trouble. He that doth not exercyse the workes of mercy / & that vnto his enemyes. He that settith other to gither by the cares & entiseth theym to hathe the one the other.

He that doth minister house / licēce / place tyme / or helpe / to the workes of this abho∣mynable lust. He that defendeth not an other mannes chastite with all his coun¦ceyle & dylygence. ¶Ageynst the seuenth offendyth. HE that vseth theft pyllage or vsery.

He that holdeth his peace knowing the truthe & withstōdith not them that so do. ¶Ageynst the last two. THe last two {pre}ceptes are these verey marke sette before vs vnto the whi¦che we must striue to come by dayly labou¦e & penaunce trusting in the helpe of god /  in his fauoure / for oure euyll desyres wil euer be vtterly destroyed vntill oure fles¦he be brought & be renued with another eneracyon. The .v. wittes are cōprehen∣ed in the fyft and syxt cōmaundemēt. The i. workes of mercy in .v. and .vij. The .vij edly synnes. Pryde in the first and secun∣e / lechery in the syxt / wrath & enuye in the yft / glotony in the syxt / slewth in the thyrde  and in all the other. Lykewise the synnes which are touwar¦es other / shewe theym selues thorough ll the commaundementes / for a man may
offend ageynst all the preceptes / by com¦maundyng / councelinge or helpyng other. The synnes whiche are called dumm and crye for vengeaunce to god are cōtra∣ry to the sixt & seuenth cōmaundementes. In all these workes we se none other thī but the loue of oure silfe / whiche seketh hi owne & taketh from God / that whiche i goddes / & from men those thinges that p¦teyne to men / it gyueth no thīge that it hath to god nor to man. Wherfor it may well  true that (s. Augustyn sayeth) the hedde o all synne is the loue of oure silfe. Of thi folowith that the preceptes cōmaunde ¦ne other thyng but loue. Ageyn forbyd n¦thing but loue. And that he that kepeth th cōmaundementes fulfilleth / nothyng b loue. Ageyn nothyng but loue breketh t cōmaundementes. And that is it that P¦le sayth loue is the fulfilling of al the co¦maundemētes. Euen as wikked loue (th is to sey the loue of thy sylfe) is the brekin of all the cōmaundementes. ¶ The fulfillinge of the cōmaundemēt THe fulfilling of the first cōmaund¦ment is feare & loue towardes G with an vntayned fayth to trust cōstau¦ly
vnto god in all thinges to betake oure sylfe playnly & purely vnto god in all poyn¦tes to mistrust and denye oure sylf vtterly in all thinges whether they be good or bad¦de. Here put in whate so euer is wryten in he hole scripture of fayth hope and loue owardes god whiche are shortly contey∣ned in this first precept. ¶ The fulfilling of the seconde is. TO prayse to honoure to blisse & calle on the name of god. Vtterly to dispi¦e and forsake oure owne name and glory so that god onely haue the prayse whiche lone worketh all thinges. Here taketh lace whate thinge so euer is writen in ho¦y scripture of the prayse of God / of giuing hankes to hym / of the name of god / of ioy nd gladnesse. ¶The fulfylling of the thyrde is. TO betake oure sylfe holy to god that he alone may worke in vs and do al hinges. This cōmaundement requireth ouertye of spryte / whiche shulde offer him elfe to god / as deede & not lyuing in this orlde that he may be his god / whiche on ym sylfe may take both his name & worke ccordynge to the meanyng of the two for
sayd commaundementes. Herunto pertey∣neth what so euer is commaunded vnto vs of worsshypping god / of heryng goddes worde of good workes / be whiche we may subdue the flesshe to the sprete / so that all oure lyfe / and all oure workes be goddes and not our owne. THe fulfillynge of the fourth is wyl¦full obedience and mekenesse to sub¦mytte hym selfe to all officers / bycause it pleaseth god so (as wrytteth thapostel Pe∣ter) without contradictyon / without com∣pleynt and without any grudging. Herun¦to applye what so euer thinges are wrytē in scrypture of obedyence / humylite / subie¦ctyon / and reuerence. ¶The fulfylling of the fyft is. SVffraunce / mekenesse / goodnesse / pea¦ce / mercy / an herte that is full puri∣fyed with loue and swetenesse / clene with∣out hate / wrath and bitternesse / not to his frendes onely / but also to his enemyes / ye and indifferently to all men. Hyther con∣ferre all the instructyons of pacyence / gen∣tilnesse / peace and vnite. ¶The fulfylling of the syxt is.
CHaslite sobernes shame fastnesse not of dedes onely but of wordes and ma¦ners / ye & of thoughtes. Besydes that attem¦peraunce / of meate / drynke / slepe / and what so euer doth helpe chastite / hether applye al places of holy scrypture cōcernyng, chasti∣te / fastyng / sobriete / attemperaunce / prayer watching / laboures / and in cōclusyon all thinges that mainteyn chastite. ¶The fulfylling of the seuenth is. POuerte of spryte / kyndenesse / liberaly¦te / wasting of oure owne goodes to profit oure neyghboures / to lyue without couetousnesse and desyre of rychesse. Here gather all that is wryten of couetousnesse of goodes vniustly gotten and possessed / of vsury / so tylte / euyll deceyte / of iniury and hurte done / of lettyng thy neyghboures profyt / or dispysing hym. ¶The fulfylling of the eyght is. A Peasable and hole tongue whiche hurteth no man / but profyteth all men whiche setteth enemyes at one / whi∣che excuseth and defendeth theym that are noted viciose parsons and synners. Suche simplicite & profit is in speakyng. Hereto perteyne all thinges whiche are spoken of
sylence & speakyng / and whate so euer tou∣cheth the good name / honoure / ryght cau∣ses / and profyttes / of thy neyghbour. ¶ The fulfilling of the last is. THe perfyt and absolute purenesse & dispysing (in the hert) of all tempo∣ral rychesse & pleasures / whiche thing shal be done perfectly in the lyfe to come. In all these thinges seest thou none o∣ther thinges but to loue other / that is to lo¦ue god and thy neyghbour whiche loue se¦keth not his owne profyt / but onely those thinges whiche belong to god / and to his neyghbour / whiche loue yeldeth & gyueth hym sylf playnly to euery man grauntyng theym full rule and auctorite / to vse theyre pleasure his goodes and profyttes. NOwe seyst thou that in all these ten∣ne cōmaundementes / in a good ordre and briefly are cōteyned / all kyndes of in formacions / that are expedient for mānes lyfe / whiche yf any man will do his dili∣gence to kepe truely he shall neuer be ydel no / not an houre / but shall haue occasyon to do good deades / so that truely he shall neuer haue nede to chose to hym other stra¦unge workes of mannys inuention / as are
to runne hyther and thyder / and to be oc∣cupied in suche thinges / whiche in no pla∣ce are cōmaunded / and whiche shalbe pro∣fitable for no thing. Hit is euydent that in all these precep∣tes there is nothing wryten / whiche tea∣cheth vs to serue oure silues / eyther to do / leue / or require of any man / that whiche cōcernyth oure owne proufit / but onely what we are bounde to do to other / that is to sey / to god and to oure neyboure. So that euen blynde men may well perceyue that the fulfylling of the commaundemen∣tes stondeth in loue towardes other / not towardes oure sylfe. For man of his owne nature seketh and auoydeth sufficiently / that whiche is for (or ageynst) his profit / so that it nedith not to moue hym to it / but muche rather to bringe hym frō hit. Ther fore he lyueth best whiche lyueth not to hym sylfe. And contrary he lyueth worst whiche ly¦ueth to hym sylf. This is theffect that the tenne cōmaundementes teache. Wherby it is manifest that there are but fewe that ly¦ue well it / in that we are men / none of vs lyeuth well.
This knowen / we must lerne of whome to axe this excellent gyfte / to lyue well / so that we may fulfyll these cōmaundemētes ¶The Crede or Belefe. THe effect of oure fayth stondith in thre partes / as in hit are rehersed thre parsonnes of the godly tryny¦te. The first is of the father. The secunde of the sonne. The thyrd of the ho∣ly goost / and to euery one of these persones is applyed his operation. This is the chief article of the fayth / on the whiche all the other depend. Here note .ij. maner of belefes. First so∣me there be whiche beleue that those thin∣ges be true / whiche are spoken of god / euen as a man doth beleue those thinges to be true whiche he heareth of the Turke / of the deuyll / and of hell. This fayth is rather a science / or a vayne opinyon / then a sure trust or belefe. There is an other faythe to¦wardes god / that thou do not onely bele∣ue these thynges to be true whiche thou hearest of god / but also trust to hym / and be take & cōmytte thy selfe wholy vnto hym /
besydes that / to presume vppon hym / bele∣uyng / without doubt that thou shalt ob∣teyn and receyue of hym / that whiche thou hardest spoken of hym / and that with suche fayth and confidence as thou wooldest gy∣ue to no man. Be it in case that the Turke (or any other man) be gretely preysed vnto the / and that thou beleue faythfully that so¦me man is discrete / and wurthy prayse / yet for all that thou wilt not cōmytte thy selfe vnto hym puttyng all thy trust and confi∣dence in hym. But this fayth whiche boldly betaketh hym selfe to god / both in ieoperdye of lyfe and deth / knowelegyng that he is such as he is spoken of maketh only a Chrysten / & obteyneth of god what so euer she desyreth nether is there any false herte that recey∣ueth this faith. For this is the quycke faith whiche is requyred in the first commaun∣dement whiche sayeth thus: I am thy god take no straunge goddes. Wherfore this / in / is not put in vayne / but it is to be obser¦ued with a notable sygnificacyon. For we do not say / I beleue to god the father or of god the father / but I beleue in god the Fa∣ther / in Iesu Christ / and in the holy goost.
Wherfore this fayth ought to be had in none but in one god / so that by this we cō∣fesse also the godhed of Christ and of the ho¦ly goost / bycause we beleue none other wi¦se in the sonne / and the holy goost / then we do in the father, hym selfe. For euen as we haue one faythe in all the thre persones / so all the thre persones are onely one god. ¶The fyrst parte of the belefe. I Beleue in God the father almyghty / maker of heuē & erthe. That is / I for∣sake Satan and all ydolatrye / all charmes witchecraftes & false hope. I put my trust in no man of all the worlde / nether yet in my sylfe / not in my power / lernyng / scyence rychesse / wysdome / or what thyng so euer it be / that I haue or possesse. I put no cōfidence in any creature whe¦ther it be in heuen or in erthe. But I put my suer trust onely in one god whiche can not be sene with mannes eye / whiche can¦not be cōprehendend with mannes witte / whiche made heuē & erth / and alone ruleth all creatures, To hym hoelly I submytte my sylfe. Nothing fearyng / nor regardyng the malice of the deuell / & his felawes / for my god is aboue theym all. Nether wolde
I put thelesse cōfidence in god / though all men did forsake me and persecute me. Nether will I trust hym thelesse / bycau¦se I am wretched and poore / bycause I am rude and vnlerned / bycause I am dispised and lacke possessions. Nether yet the lesse bicause I am a synner for this my faith doth sarre passe / al thīges (as it is necessary & ought to do) what so¦euer eyther be / or be not / bothe synnes and vertues & to be short / all thinges. So that she doth purely & hoely fixe her self in God onely / as the first cōmaundement teachith and compellith me. Nether desire I any signe to tempt hym I trust faythfully vnto hym / all though he differre & tary at his pleasure I will not sette or prescribe to hym any ende / any ty∣me / measure or reason but I commit all to his will / with a pure faith and a stable. For he is almyghty / what can I lacke that he can not gyue and do vnto me? For he is the maker of heuen & erth and lorde of all thinges / what thing can hyn∣dre me or hurte me? Howe may it be that all thinges shall not turne to myn vse and profit / when he to, whome all these thyn∣ges
ar subiect and obedyent fauoureth me and loueth me? Nowe (syth he is god) he knoweth whe¦runto he hath ordyned me / and howe eue∣ry thinge shalbe best for me and that whi∣che he knoweth / he may do. Yf he be my fa¦ther / it is sure that he wil se the best for me and that with a good will. When I doubt not herof and haue suche trust in hym / then no doubt I on his ser∣uaunt his sonne / & his heyre for euer. And euen as I beleue se shall it be vnto me. ¶The secunde parte of the belefe. ANd in Iesu Christ / his onely sonne oure lorde. Whiche was cōceyued by the holy goost / borne of Mary the virgyn. Suffred vnder Pontius Pylatus / crucy∣fyed / deede / and buryed / descended to helle / the thyrd day rose ageyn from deth. Ascen∣ded to heuen / syttith on the ryght hand of God the father almyghty / from thens he shall come to iudge quycke and deade, That is / I do not only beleue / that Iesu Christ is the true & only sonne of God / by euerlasting & godly nature / & beyng frō the begynnyng & euer begotten: but also that all thinges are subdued vnder hym / & that
he is my lorde / and the lorde of all creatu∣res / made ruler of theym beyng man / whi∣che he hym self with the father in his diuy¦nite dyd make. I beleue that no man may beleue in god the father or may come vnto the father / ne∣ther by science and lernyng nether by wor¦kes / nether by theyre owne reason and wit¦te or by what thing so euer may be named in heuen or erthe / but by this and in this Iesu Chryst his onely sonne / that is to say by the sayth in the name and power of Ie∣su Chryst. I beleue vnfaynedly / and surely / that he was conceyued for my proufit by the holy goost without all mannes and carnal wor¦ke / without a bodyly father / or mannes se¦de / and that to purifye / and make spirituall my synfull / flesshely / vnclene / and dampna¦bill conception / and all theyrs that bele∣ue in hym: moued to his mercy of his ow∣ne and fre will and the will of the almygh¦ty father. ¶I beleue that he was begotten of the virgyn Mary without the losse of her pu∣re and vncorrupt virgynite / so that (accor∣dyng to the prouidence of the mercyfull fa¦ther)
he shulde blysse and clense the synnes & dāpnabill byrth of all that beleue in hym that after / it myght do no hurte. I beleue that he suffred passyon & deth for my synnes / and all theyrs that beleue in him / & that he therby blyssed all passyons / crosses & deathes / so that after they myght not hurte / but be bothe holsome and mery∣torious. I beleue that he was deade and buryed to mortifye & bury all my synnes / & theyrs that beleue. Finally that all bodely deth bi his deth was distroyed / so that it is of no power to hurte but is rather made holeso∣me and profitable. I belefe that he went downe to hell to subdewe and make captyue / to me & to all that beleue / the deuyll with all his impe∣ry / subtilite and malice / to delyuer me frō helle / takyng awey all his power that he myght not hurte me / but shulde rather be profitable vnto me. I beleue that on the thyrde day he rose ageyn from deth / to bryng me and all that beleue in to a newe lyfe / and that by this dede he reysed me with hym / in grace and spryte / not to synne after / but that I endo∣wed
with all kindes of grace and vertue / myght serue hym / and so fulfull his comma¦undementes. I beleue that he ascended vnto heuen / and that he hath receyued of the father / rule / & honoure aboue all aungelles / and creatu∣res. And that he nowe sittith on the ryght honde of the father / that is / that he is king and lorde ouer all the goodes of godyn he¦uen hell and erthe. Wherfore he may helpe me and theym that bileue / yn all maner of aduersitees against all oure aduersares and ennemyes. I beleue that from thens he shal retour∣ne the last day / to iudge quycke / whome he them shall finde alyue / and deed whyche before were buried. And that he shall com¦pell all men and aungelles good and euel to come before the seate of his iudgement (whome they shal se bodyly) to delyuer me and all faithfull / from bodyly deth / from all euyl / and synnes. And to punysshe with eternall iudgement his enemyes / and ad∣uersaryes / so that we shalbe delyuered frō theyre power for euer. ¶The thirde parte of the belefe. I Beleue in the holy ghoost / the holy
Christen churche / the communyon of sain¦tes / the forgeuenesse of synne / the rysing / of flesshe / and euerlasting life. Amen. That is to sey / I do not onely beleue that the holy goost is verey god with the father & the sonne. But also that no man can co∣me to the father by ceist / by his lyfe / passiō / deth & what so euer who spokē of christ or opteyne any of these thinges / without the worke of this sprete with the whiche spre¦ce I desire the father & the son / to touch me and all faithfull to sturre me vp / to call / to drawe / and by Chryst and in christ to quyc¦ken me to make me holy and spirituall and so to brynge me to the father / for it is he / whiche with the father / bi christ & in christ workith and quyckenyth all thinges. I beleue that in all the we ide / be hit neuer so greate / there is but one comune christen church whiche is none other thing but the cōgregacyon & cōmunyon of holy men that is of ryghtuous & faithfull men on the erth And that this churche by this holy sprete is gathered & maintened. Thorough who¦me also it is gouerned and encreased dayly by the sacramentes and worde of god. I beleue that no man can euer be saued /
whiche is not foūde agreable & consenting with this congregaciō / in one faith in one worde / in one sacrament / hope and charyte And that none of the Iewes or gentyles can be saued with this cherche except they reconcyle theym self vnto it / and come in fauoure wich it / confirmyng theym selues in all poyntes therunto. I beleue that in this communion or Christen te all the prayers and good wor¦kes of this congregation do necessarily hel¦pe me / waye om my syde and comfort me in all tymes of lyfe and deth. I beleue that in this congregation & comē¦welth (and in none other place) is gorgeue¦nesse of synnes. And that without this all greate and good workes / how many so e∣uer there are of theym do nothyng profyt to forgeuenesse of synne. And contrary¦wyse in thys congregatyon / the multytu∣te / greatnesse / and often commyttyng of synnes / do nothyng hurte / nether lette the forgheuenesse of synne / but that this forgy¦uenesse doth contynue whersoeuer / and howe song / thys excellent churche doth endure. To whome alsoo Cryst ghyueth hys keyes / and sayeth in the
xviij. of Mathewe what soeuer ye lose vp¦pon erthe / it shalbe losed in heuen: lykewi¦se he saith to Peter alone / in the name and stede of this onely one churche in the, xvi. of Mat. Whatsoeuer thou lose vppon er∣the it shall losed in heuen. I beleue that there shalbe arrysing of the¦ym that are deade / in the whiche rysing the holy gost shall sturre vppe all fleshe / that is all men concernyng the body and flesshe good & onell / so that the very flesshe why∣che was dead buryed and consumed or by other wayes destroyed shal retourne / and lyue agayn. I beleue that after this resurrectiō shal∣be eternall lyfe of good men / and eternall deth of synners. Of all these thinges I doubt not but eue∣ry one of theym shal come vnto me frō the father bi the sonne Iesu chryst oure lord with and in the holy goost. Amen that sig∣nifieth that in good fayth & wythout doubt all these thinges are trewe. ¶The prayer of the lorde cal¦led the Pater noster wheryn are con¦teyned .vij. peticions. ¶The preface and introduccion to ar
these .vij. peticions is conteyned in these wordes. Oure father whiche art in heuen. The vnderstonding of the wordes. ALmyghty god sith thou of thyne intynyte beneuolence and mer∣cy hast not onely admytted vs / but also taught / ye and commaū¦ded by the onely / and dere son oure lorde Iesu christ that we (trusting in his mery∣es and protection / he beyng oure interces¦sor) shulde beleue that thou were a louig father vnto vs. And that we shulde also call the father / though worthyly and bi gre¦at ryghte thou mightest haue byn a cruell iuge agaynst vs sinners whiche so oft and abhominably haue done agaynst thy god∣ly and most holi will / and haue gyuen the occasion of displeasure agaynst vs. Gyue vs we beseche the / by the fame beniuolen∣ce and mercy / that we may haue in oure hertes sure trust (without feare) of thy fa¦therly loue And make vs feare this accep¦table smelle & swetnesse / whiche the most sure / and chyldly trust doth gete vnto vs / that we may with glad mynde call the fa∣ther / knowlege / loue / and crye on the in al

Thou wilt also / not onely symply / be called a father / but that we with a comē voyce shuld call the oure father. And so with a speciall prayer of v∣nyte pray for euery man Wherfore gyue vn¦to vs anagreyng / and brotherly loue / so that we may perceyue euery one of vs that we are truely brothers / and sisters / and may pray to the as to oure comen and mer¦cyfull father / euery on for other / euen as kynd chyldren entreate theyre father one for another.

Let thy kyngdome come. THis wretched lyfe is the kyngdome of all synnes / & myscheffe whose lor¦de is the euell sprete / chief author / & grūde of all malice & synne / But thy kingdome is the kingdome of all grace & vertue / whose lorde is thy best beloued sonne Iesus crist the heede & begynnyng of all grace & v{er}tue / wherfore helpe vs most dere father / & co∣me agayn in fauoure with vs. Gyue vs bi¦fore all thinges true and constaunte faithe in Christ hope (without feare) in thy mer∣cy / agaynst all infirmytes of oure weake conscyence / and pure loue towardes the / and all men. Kepe vs from infydelyte / des¦peratyon / and malyce / whyche at the last myght be the cause of oure destructyon, Make vs to auoyde the soule desyre of le∣chery.

Make the vertues of thy kyngdome to come and re∣ygne withyn vs. Gyue vs peace / concor∣de and tranquylyte so that wrathe / or any other vytternesse haue not hys kyngdome in vs / but rather (through thy grace) the

Graunt vs that the in¦ordinate trouble and sykenesse of minde ha¦ue no place in vs / but make the reioysyng and pleasure in thy grace and mercy rule / and haue dominion.

Gyue vs a stable purpose and streyngth / not onely to begynne thys good lyfe / but rather to {pro}cede boldly in it and to {per}forme it / as the prophete sayeth. Lighten myn ces lest I slepe or bewery ī the good lyfe ones begonne / and so myne enemye do bryng me

Delyuer vs from this parylouse / & synful life. Make vs desyre the other lyfe to come / and to hate this present lyfe. Gyue vs grace not to feare death / but rather to desire it Put from vs the loue and desyre of this lyfe / that so thy kyngdome may ful∣ly be perfect in vs. Of this peticion are al psalmes / verses / and prayers in the whiche grace and vertue is desyred of god. ¶The thirde petycion. ¶ Thy wyll be fulfylleth in erth as it is in heuen.

Make vs that we impute it not to the deuell or euell men / when any ad∣uersyte chaunseth: but that we attrybute all vnto thy godly will / whiche ordyneth all suche thynges / that oure will may be∣leefe / and that blissednesse may encrease in thy kyngdome, Gyue vs grace that we may
be glad / & meryte to dye / & that for thi wyll we may take oure deth gladli so that by fe¦are nor infirmyte we be not made disoby∣ent vnto the Make that all oure membres eyes / tongue / herte / handes and fete / be not suffred to folowe theyre desyres nether that we be at any tyme subdewed vnder theym but that we (euē as takē and emprysoned) may be brokē in thy will & pleasure. Kepe vs from all euyll / misshe vous / obstinate / hard / styffe / vngentill / and resisting will. Gyue de we obediēce / parsait & freminde in all spiritual thinges / worldly / euerlasting & transitory. Kepe vs frō the most horribill synne of grugyng slaunder / accusing & fo∣lisshe hardy iudgemēt / that we condēpne no man or turne any thing to rebuke Put from vs that abhominabill euyl / and most greuous stroke al suche tongues / & teache vs that if we se or heare of other any thyng worthye of rebuke / & whiche dyspleaseth vs / that we holde oure peace & hyde it cōple¦nyng to the onely / putting & committyng it vnto thy will / so that with all oure min¦de we forgeue theim that offēd vs for who¦me also we be sory. Teache vs to vnder∣stoud that no man may hurte vs except be
do hym selfe moche more hurie in thi sighe so that we may be moued with mercy to∣wardes hym / rather then we shuld be pro¦uoked to wrath rather wepyng for his blī¦denesse / then to thinke of aduengemēt. Gy¦ue vs grace that we reioyce not in theyr trouble / whiche haue resisted oure will or hurte vs / or in what poynt so euer theyre life displeasith vs / and also that we be not sory when they prosper & haue welfare. Of this peticion are all psalmes verses and prayers teaching vs to pray for oure enemyes / and against oure synnes. ¶ The fourthe peticion. Gyue vs this day oure dayly breade. THe breade is oure lorde Iesus Crist whyche nourysseth / and conforteth the soule. Therfore: O heuenly father / gy∣ue vs thys grace / that the lyfe of Chryst wordes / workes / and passions / may be pre¦ached / knowen / and holden / bothe of vs / & of all the worlde. Gyue vs grace that we may haue his wordes / worltes and all his lyfe for an affectuose example / and specta∣cle of all vertues. Gyue vs grace that i oure passyons and aduersytes / we may
comfort oure selfe by hys passyon and cros¦se. Gyue vs grace that we may with a sca¦ble faith ouercome oure deth by his deth / and folowe without feare this nobil cap¦teyn into āother life. Gyue this grace that all they that preache / may proufitably and blissedly preache thy word / and Iesu crist through all the worlde and that al whicke haue thy worde preached / may lerne Crist and so may be purified / and go forth in a better life. Graunt this also mercyfull fa∣ther / that all straūge doctrynes in the whi¦che Christ is not lerned may be thrust out of thy churche. Haue mercy on all bisschop¦pes / prestes and on al theym whome they call consecrated / & of all officers that they maye be lyghteneth with thy grace / to tea¦che & rule well / bothe in worde & also crā∣ple of life. Kepe al that are weke in the faith lest they be offended bi the myschevous ex¦emple of heddes and rulers. Kepe vs from hereyses and doctrynes of dyuision / that we may be agreyng in one mynde / syth we vse one dayly brede that is / one day∣ly doctryne / and worde of Chryst. Tea∣che vs by thy grace / to thynke / and haue in mynde / truely (and as we ought to do)
the passyon of Christ / and to ioyne it happy¦ly with oure lyfe / so that we may cōme and atteyn some thing / though it be but the sha¦dowe of it. Finally gyue vs oure dayly bre¦ade / that Christ in vs & we in Chryst may dwelle perpetuelly / and may worthyly be∣re this name / syth of Christ we are called Christen. Of this peticyon are all kinde of prayers and Psalmes / with whiche we pray for oure officers / ageynst false tea∣chers / for the Iewes / for heretikes / and all other that are out of the ryght wey. And also with whiche we pray for theym that lacke onforte. ¶The fyft peticyon, ¶ Forgyue vs oure treaspaces euen as we forgyue theym that trespas vs. THis prayer hath a certeyn cōdicyon and sygne annexed with hym / whi∣che s that first we forgeue oure trespas∣sers. This done / then may we say forgeue be oure trespasses. Before also in the thyrde peticyon we prayed that the will of God myght be fulfilled / whiche willeth that we suffer all thinges paciently / not quytyng euell for euell / nether sekyng auengement / but that we do good for euyll / by thexam∣ple
of oure father in heuyn / whiche maketh his sonne shyne vppon good and euyll / and sendeth his rayne vppon kynd and vnkinde ¶This is nowe oure prayer. O father cōforte oure cōscience / bothe nowe / and in the day of deth / whiche con∣science nowe is abasshed seynge his synne and iniquyre / & then also shalbe abasshed / remembryng thy cruell iugemēt. Gyue thy peace into oure hartes that we (reioysing) may loke for thy iugement. Entre not in∣to iudgement with thy strayte lawe / for in it shall no man be funde innocent & ryght∣uous. Teache vs dere father not to sticke or be comforted in oure good workes or di¦seruynges / but to gyue and submytte oure selfe playnely and faithfully to thyne iufi∣nite and incōparable mercy. Agayne. Ma∣ke that we despeyre not for this oure gyl∣ty and synfull lyfe / but that we maye iudg∣ge thy mercy more myghty and stronger then oure lyfe / howe soeuer we haue orde∣red it. Helpe and cōfort all mennes cōscien¦ce whiche in the poynt of deth / or in any o∣ther suche temptacyon are vexed with de∣speracyon. Forgyue theym and vs oure de¦ces / comfort theym / refresshe theym / and
he recōciled vnto theim. Gyue vs thy good¦nesse for oure malice / as thou cōmaundest that we shulde do. Cast doune the horrible fende flaunderer / accusar / and encreasar / of our synnes nowe and in the poynt of deth and to be short / in all straytnesse of cōscien¦ce. Gyue vs grace to auoyd that by oure dif¦famacyon mennes synnes appere not the more greuous, Iudge vs not after the ac∣cusacyon of the deuyll and oure wretched conscience / nether heare the voyce of oure enemyes whiche accuse vs day and nyght byfore the / euē as we wyl not heare theim whiche diffame and accuse other. Take from vs the greuous hepe of the synnes in oure conscience / so that we refresshed by he suer trust and confidence of thy mercy in the botom of oure hart / may lyue / dye / suffer / and take all thinges pacyently. In this peticyon take place all Psalmes and prayers whiche ageynst synnes crye on the mercy of God. ¶ The sext peticyon. ¶ And leade vs not in to temp∣tacyon.
WE are assauted with thre maners of temptacyon and vexacyon / the fles∣she / the worlde / & the deuell. Ther∣fore we desire the most dere father to endo¦we vs so with thy grace that we may with¦stond the desires of the flesshe. Make that we resyst and fyght ageynst this super fluy¦te of meate / drynke / slepe / slouth / and ydel∣nesse. Make that we may bryng hym in to bondage and subiectyon / with fasting / tem¦perate dyete / clothing / slepe / rest / watche & laboure / so that he may be mete / and apte to good workes. Make that with Chryst we may fastyn on the crosse and mortifye his euell desires to lechery / all his affectiōs and instigations: so that we neuer consent or folowe any his temtations. ☞ Make that yf by chaunce we loke on a well made or fayre man or woman / or any other beu∣tyfull ymage or creature / that they be not to vs a cause of temptacyon: But that the rather of theym we may take occasyon to loue chastite / and to prayse the in thy crea∣tures. Make that whē we heare any glad or plesaunt thinge / or feale any swete thīg that we seke not theryn oure delyte and pleasure / but thy prayse and glory. Kepe vs
from this greate synne of couetousnesse / & desyre to worldly rychesse. Gyue vs grace that we syke not the rule and honoure of this worlde / or cōsent to suche desyres. Ke¦pe vs that the false subtiltie of this worlde the counterfayt bryghtnesse / & entisementes of the same persuade vs not to folowe it. Kepe vs that we be not drawen by the e∣uylles and myseries of this worlde to im∣patience / auengement / wrathe / or to other suche vices. Gyue vs grace that we may de¦spyse the lyes of the worlde / coloures / de∣ceytes / promyses / and falshod. And to be shorte / that we may forsake all that belon¦gyth to hym good & euell / as we haue pro∣mysed in baptesme / and that we may conti∣nue in this purpose goynge forward dayly more and more. Kepe vs from the entyse∣mentes of the deuyll / that we cōsent not to ryde / whiche wolde cause vs to sette mo∣he by oure selfe (and despyse other) for ry∣hesse kynne power / science lernyng / beuty or any other gyftes or goodnesse. Kepe vs that we fall not in the synne of hate / and nuye / whate occasyon so euer we haue gy¦en vnto vs. Kepe vs that we doubte not n thy fayth / nether falle in desperation / no
we / nor in the poynt of deth. Put thy hel∣ping hade oure best heuenly father to theim that fyght and laboure ageynst this harde and manyfolde temptacyon. Cōfort theim that nowe do stōde / and lyfte theym vppe that lye and are fallen. Finally fulfyll vs all with thy grace / that in this miserabyll and perilous lyfe (whiche is cōpassed with so many cōtinuell enemyes that neuer cea∣se) we may fyght boldly with stable and no¦ble fayth / & obteyn the euerlasting crowne ¶The seuenth peticyon. But delyuer vs from euell. ¶This peticyon prayeth for all the euyl∣les of paynes and punysshemētes as doth the churche in the letany. O Father, delyuer vs from thy euer lasting wrathe and punishe men¦ces of helle. Delyuer vs from thy strayte iugement in dethe / and  the last day of iudgement. Delyuer vs frō sondayne dethe. Kepe vs from the violen∣ce of water and fyre from lyghtnyng and hayle Kepe vs from hunger and derthe / ke¦pe vs from warre and manslaughter. Kepe vs from thy most greuous strokes / the pe∣stilence / frenche pockes / and suche other di¦seases.
Kepe vs from all euyll and perilles of the body. Reserued that in all these thin¦ges / be the glory of thy name / encreace of thy kingdome / and fulfylling of thy will. ¶Amen. ¶Graunt vs good lorde that all these prayers may be obteyned of vs with outē douthe. Nether suffer that we my strust a∣ny thing / but that in all these thinges we shalbe herde / ye be herd all redy. And let all these thinges be sure and with oute a∣ny doute. So may we with glad here say / amen / that is to say stable / constant / trewe and ser. ¶ The salutacyon of our Lady called Aue Maria. HEre take hede no man put his su∣re trust and hope in the mother of god or her merytes / for this sure trust is dewe to god onely / as the chiefe & onely worship with whiche we a¦re cōmaūded to honoure onely god. The fa¦uoure whiche was gyuen to her of god / gy¦ueth vs an occasyon to prayse god / & gyue hym thākes, We ought none otherwise to prayse & loue her / thē one whiche hath re∣ceyued
suche goodnesse without her owne deseruyng of the pure liberalyte & fauoure of God / euen as she her selfe doth knowe∣lege in the songe Magnificat. For as I am moued by the syght of heuen / the sonne / or other creatures to cōmende and preyse the maker / and put theym in to my prayse / and prayer / saying. O good lord whiche hast made suche a bryght and goodly creature gyue I pray the. &c. ¶ So in this place in oure prayer we fette the mother of god / and say. O gloriou¦se god what a noble virgyn haste thou ma¦de / blessed and preysed be she. And thou lor¦de whiche haste so glorifyed and exalted her / graunte I desyre the also to me. &c. So that oure herte consyst not in her / but maye go forth by her to Chryst and to god hī selfe. Wherfore the prayer is also made on this maner that it gyuer all to god whē we say / hayle Mary full of grace / the lorde is with the / blyssed art thou among wymē and blyssed is the trute of thy wōbe Iesus Christ. Here thou seyst that in these wor∣des no peticyon but pure prayses and ho∣noures are cōteyned / lyke as in the begyn∣nynge & first wordes of the Pater noster
is no peticyon / but onely prase and decla∣ring of the godly fauour and maiestye that he is oure father and in heuen. Therfore we can not call this salutacion a peticyon or any prayer / because it is not laufull for vs / to expounde these wordes for ther then they sounde / and then the holy gost dyd ma¦ke theym. Howe be it we may entreate of this salutacyon dyuers maner of wayes. First as a meditacyō / that we may in this remembre the grace whiche god gaue / her. Secundly that we may desyre also that she may be knowen and exalted of al men / for she was full of grace / wherby it is knowē that she had no synne imputed to her / and this was a speciall fauoure of God / to be full of all goodnesse and voyde of al euell Thirdly / that she is blyssed emong all wy∣men / not for that alone that she brought forth her chylde without laboure and pay¦ne / otherwyse then Eua / and other wymē but also bycause she cōceyued frute with∣out synne / and that bodyly frute by the ho¦ly ghost / whiche was gyuen to none other woman. ¶ Fourthly that her frute was blyssed and preserued ageynst the curse whi¦che dyd fall vppon all the chyldren of Eue
bycause they were all cōceyued in synne / & borne gylty of deth and dampnacyon. But this onely frute of her wōbe alone be blys∣sed / in the whiche frute all we are blyssed. Fyftly here may be added a peticyon and de¦sire / that we may pray for theym whiche sa∣ye euyll by this frute & mother. But who are these that say euyl by theym? truely they whiche persequute and curse / his worde (whiche is the gospell) and the faythe of Christ / as nowe a days do the Iewes and papistes. Of the whiche it foloweth / that in this season / no man doth so moche blas∣pheme this mother and his sonne: as they that mumble vp so many rosaryes / & euer haue in theyre mouth / Aue Maria. For the¦se be the chief capteyns whiche curse and blaspheme the worde of God / and the faith of Christ. Wherfore note / that this mother & her sonne be sayde well by .ij. maner of wayes carnally and spiritually. Carnally with the mouth onely and wordes of this saluta¦cyon whiche are Aue Maria. And these be they whiche thiefly of all do curse and blas¦pheme theym. Spiritually with the herte when we do prayse her son Iesu Christ in
all his wordes / workes & passyō / & say well by hym. When we are gladly cōtent to suf∣fer persecucyō / for his trouthes sake / rather then to forsake it. When for his sake we are cōtent to loue oure neyboure as oure selfe But this can no man do except he be inspi∣red with pure & true fayth. For without this fayth can no harte be good / but rather of nature full of curses & rebukes / towar∣des god & all his sayntes. Therfore I wol¦de counceyl hym that lacketh this faythe to absteyne from this salutacyon ye and from all maner prayers / for of theym it is wrytē in the hundred & eight Psalme / his prayer be turned in to synne. ¶ Consolacyon for troubled consciences. THappostel Paule in the .xv. to the Romayns (goynge about to descri¦be the cōfortes of Christen) sayth Whatsoeuer thinges are wryten a fore tyme are wryten for oure lerning that we thorough pacyence and comfort of the scripture shuld haue hope wherby he tea∣cheth pleynly that we must seke oure com¦fort out of the holy scripture.
Nowe doth his scripture vse .ij. figures of cōfort / settynge forth and declaryng vn¦to vs .ij. ymages of euyll and good thinges myxte in a dewe and most holsome tempe∣rature. As the wyse Ecclesiastique sayth. In the day of euylles remembre good thin¦ges and in the day of good thinges remem¦bre euyll thinges. Well knoweth the holy ghoost that euery thing is of suche value and power to a man / as his mynde & oppy∣nion is in it. For that whiche in his oppi∣nyōie vyle & of no reputacyon / he casteth but lytell loue vnto it / yf it chaunce to him and lytyll regardeth yf it falle from hym, Therfore his laboure is to plucke and cal awey a man from this mynde and opinion of this worldly possessyons. This done: now are all thinges indifferent / howe be it syth this calling awey is chiefly done by the worde of God (wherby thoppinyon is reuocate frō the thing whiche presently is desired / to the thing which is absent & not desired) of verey ryght we shall haue con∣fort of nothyng but scripture / whiche in the day of euylles calleth vs to loke for goodnesse whiche other is present or to co¦me / and in the day of goodnesse to loke for
euyll. Howe be it that we may knowe the¦se visyōs & ymages the better we shall deui¦de eche of theym in to .vij. partes. The fyrst ymage shall haue euylles whiche shalbe cō¦sidered: first with in hym selfe. Secundly byfore hym / thirdly / after hym / fourthly by∣side hym in the lyft hond / fyftly on his ryght hond. syxtly / beneth hym, Seuently / aboue hym. ¶The first chapiter of the first ymage whiche is the inward euyll. THis is sure stable & most true (whe∣ther man beleue it or not) that the∣re can be no vexacyon and punysshement so greate in man / but that there is hym bo∣the euyll and iniquite moche worse. So a∣bundaunt & copiouse are his euylles whi∣che he fealeth not. If truely he dyd feale his euyll / he shulde feale very hell / for he hath helle in hī self. Thou wilt are howe? The prophete sayeth euery man is a lyer. And ageyn / Euery man lyuing is all vany¦e. To be vayne and a lyar is to be voyd of truth / and to be voyd of truth is to be with out god / and to be nothing. And that is to be in hell / & dampned. Therfore God chastynyng vs mercyfully doth open and
put on vs oure casier and lyghter offences knowing that yf he shuld lede and brynge man to knowe his hole misery / he shulde pe¦risshe within a lytell space / howebeyt he hath caused some to feale & tast their owne of whome it is wrytten / he leadeth downe to hell / and bryngeth ageyn. Wherfore they say well / whiche call the bodyly passyons certeyn warnynges and monisshementes of the euyl / whiche lieth with in. And thap¦postel in the .xij. to the Ebrewes calleth theym the fatherly instructions of God a∣yng / he scourgeth euery sonne that he rece¦ueth / which he doth that by these scourgy¦ges & lytell euylles / he may expell the great euylles / lest after he be compelled to feale theym / as it is wryten in the .xxij. of the pro¦uerbes / folisshenesse is bound to gyther in the hert of the chylde / but the rodde of cor¦reccyon shall auoyde it. Do not kynde fa∣thers more lament their chylder yf they be theues or euyll them yf they be wounded, yeis / they thē selues do bete theym & woun¦de theym that they shulde not be euil. Wha¦ce then lettyth that this abhominable euil with in vs is not felt? truely as I sayde / the prouidence of god that man (cōsidering
his inward corrupcyon & vice) shuld not perisshe. For he hydeth theym / wylling that by onely fayth they shulde be sene perfectly though he doth showe some part of theym by a sensyble euyll. Therfore in the daye of euylles remembre goodnesse. Consyder ho∣we good it is / not to knowe thyne hole e∣uyll. Remembre well this goodnesse / and thy sensyble euyll shall the lesse vexe the. And cōtrary in the day of goodnesse remē∣bre euylles / that is / when thou dost not fea¦le thy true euylles / yet se thou be not vn∣kynd / but remembre thy true euylles / and so shalt thou feale the lesse thy sensyble e∣uylles. Therfore it is euydent that in man there is rather lacke of sorowe then suffi∣cyent sorowe in this lyfe / not bycause that his euyll is not present byfore hym / but by¦cause the affeccyon / opinion and mynde of it is not present whiche thorowe the good¦nesse of god is hydden. For we may se theym to whome it is gy¦uen to knowe theyre hole iniquite / howe fearse & cruell they are ageynst theym selfe howe they regard not to suffer thorough all theyre lyfe / whate thing so euer it were / so that they felt not theyre hell and mysery.
Euyn so wolde euery man do / yf he ey∣ther knewe or did beleue suerly his inward euyll he wolde of his owne wyll call vn∣to hym outward euylles / ye / reioyse in theym / and be no more sadde for theym / then though he were in all prosperyte and felt no tribulacyon as some holy men haue done / emong the whiche Dauid was e Psalme .C.vi. Therfore the fyrst cōfortable ymage s / to say vnto hym self. O thou man yet thou fealest not thyne euyll / be glad & gyue thn¦kes that thou act not cōpelled to feale  so thyne euyll in comparyson of that gt euyll is but lyght and easy / & that it is tt some say, I haue deserued moche worse helle / whiche is sone sayd / but it is intoe∣rable to felt. And this euell / though it e¦ruer so hydde and secret / yet he bryngh forth his frute sensibly / whiche is fear & wauering of the fearfull cōsciences / by e whiche faythe is fore beseged and assaed whyle that man douteth and is vncertn whether god be mercyful vnto hym or not and the weaker this frute is / the more t∣ter is this frute. And this onely infyrmite / yf he be well
cōsydered and loked on / syth it is spirituall doth ferre passe al bodyly trouble / and ma¦keth it to seme but a trifell / yf that they be well compared to gither. Besides this all that the churche speaketh of when she reherseth so oft vanite & aflic∣tion of the sprete / perteyne to the inward euilles. What counseyles do we take in va¦yn howe many of oure purposes are moc¦ke? howe many thinges se we? howe ma∣ny heare we: that we wolde neither se nor heare / & these thynges that some tyme ma∣ke for oure purpose some time are agaynst it  so moche that nothing is hole & perfa¦it Furthermore / the more honoure & digni¦te  man is set in the more and greater are his trāsgressions / & the more is hes vexed with hetes / waues / and other stormes abo¦ue all other / so that the .C.iij. psalme may wel say The reare in the see of this world  bestes / and greate / and treapyng wor¦ / without nombre that is to say / infini¦te indes of temptations / so that for this cause Iob in the .vij. calleth a mannes ly∣fe no thing but temptacyon. And these are not therfore the lesse euil bicause they be but lytel fealt but bicause
they are so in vse and familier with vs we sette the lesse by theym. And therfore (as god wold also it shuld be) they moue & trou¦ble vs but seide / all though we can not ful¦ly dispyse & forget theym. And trewe it is that we feale & perceaue scāt the thousand part of dure euylles. And yet we feale not those accordyng to the truth and greuous∣nesse of theym / but measure theym by ou∣re opinion / affection / and mynde. ¶The secunde chaptre of the secūde ima∣ge / whiche is the euyll to come or bifore a man. IT shall not a lytell easy thy present euyll what soeuer it be if thou turne thy mynde to consyder thynges to come / whiche are so manye & of suche efficacyte / that vnto them is onlye ascribed the grea∣te & greuous passyō of mynde called feare. For thus some diffine it. Feare is a passyō of the mynde about euyll to come ī so mo∣che that cappostel sayeth / go not about to sa fauoure hyge thynges but feare. And the more vncerteyn this euil is / the greater it is / in so moche that it is a comon prouerbe there is none age paste the stable altough this disease belonge to chylder and babes.
Do that by this ye may gather / that the∣re is no mā sure & fre / from any other man¦nes infirmyte. But what soeuer one man suffereth the same may an other suffer al∣so. To this pertayne all storyes & tragedy∣es of all worldes / & all the compleyntes of this worlde. To this also maye be applyed that certeyn men haue obserued more then iij. hundreth diseases with the whiche mā¦nes bodi mai be vexed If thē there be so ma¦ni diseases / how many accydentes thinkest thou are there that may chaūce vpō oure goodes & vpō oure frēdes? Howe many en¦cōbraūces & turmētes of the soule whiche is the princpall groūde wherin consist all these euylles / & the onely receauer of soro∣we & sadnesse. And the greater a man is & in the more dignite / the more the streyngth & fealinge of this euyll encreaseth And we¦re rayneth pouertie / slaunder & suche other (syth they may sone chaunce) it is nedefull that they be feared euery houre / euen as though they did hang ouer vs / by a lytell threde. Lyke as the swerde whyche dyoni∣sius the tiraunt dyd hāge ouer his geestes hedes Of all these thīges whatsoeuer doth not chaunce vnto the count it for a vanu∣rage
/ and as it were for a comforte of the euil whiche thou art striken with al / that also here thou mayst be compelled to say with Hieremas. It is the merci of god that we are not consumed For whiche so euer doth not come vnto vs / it is kept of by the strong hond of god / whiche compasseth vs with suche power and might (as it is she¦wed in Iob) that Satā and other euylles are wroth that they are kept from vs The¦refore we se howe swetely god shuldt be lo¦ued when any thyng chaunceth to vs For this most louing father warneth vs) b this one euyll) to beholde howe many euylles are aboute to subdue vs / if he dit not defend vs as though he shulde say / sathan and the hole hell of euylles persue to subdue the / but I haue prescribed & set the ende of the see / & haue sayd vnto hym / hyther shall thy swelling waues and come here shal they ce¦ate / and be broken / as he sayeth in the .xxxviij. of Iob. But be it paraduenture that god wil that none of them shall come / yet at the lest that which is called most fearfull of all (that is death) shall suerlye come and nothing so vnsuer as hys tyme and houre / whyche
euyll truely is so greate, that we may se ma¦ny mē whiche had leuer lyue and continue with al those euilles / them ones do dye to haue theym all fynisshed. And to thys one (contempnyng all other) scripture putteth feare / saying / remembre thy last ende & thou shalt neuer synne. To this se howe many meditacyons: howe many bokes: howe ma¦ny meanes: howe many remedies: are yma¦gined / that by the memorye of this one euil they may feare vs from synne / make vs dis∣pyse the world / alleuiate oure passyons / & euylles / and cōfort theym that are vexed / by the comparyson of this horrible & grea∣te euyll / whyche for all that is necessarye. There is no man whiche wolde not desy∣re to suffer all euylls / yf he myght by those auoyde death / for deth holy men did feare ye Chryst hym self went to his deth with fe¦are and bloudy droppes of swette. Final∣ly so horryble is this euyll that the mercie of god neuer toke more diligence / then to comfort oure weaknesse in this mater / as we shall se hereafter. All those thinges are comyn and indiffe¦rent to all men / euen as the benefytes of helth are comyn to theym that are vexed.
Howe be it to the christen there is a newe and speciall cause / to feare this euyll to co∣me which dothe ferre passe all other euyl∣les. And this is it that thappostel deschry∣eth .i. Corin .x. sayenge. Let him that thyn¦keth that he stondeth take hede / lest he fall The wey is so slypper and oure enemyes so myghty / armed with out owne powers (that is to sey with the socoure of oure ow¦ne flessh and of all oure euyll desyres) accō¦panyed with the infinite multitude of the worlde / wyth deuities and pleasures on the reght honde / with fearsnesse / crueltye of mē & displeasures on the lift honde / besy¦des the craft of subtiltie & a thousād weyes to hurte / deceyue and destroye / whiche he is instructe wyth al hym selfe. Thus lyue we / beynge not sure to contynue one my∣nute of an houre in our good mynd & pur∣pose. Saint Cipriane remembring many of the¦se thynges in a pistle whyche he made of mortalyte / doth teache that it is good to de¦syre deth / as a quycke helper to scape these euylles. And trulye when these men were in a goode mynde / and dyd entreate of the¦se infinyte ieopardyes / we do se theym (dis¦pysynge
lyfe and death that is to saye al the¦se foresaid euylles) desyre to dye and to be dyssolued / so that they myghte be loosed fro¦me the multytude of synnes / that are in the¦ym (as we haue sayde in the fyrst image) & into whiche they may fall of the whiche we speake nowe. And truly these .ij. thīges are verey ryghtuouse both to desire deth / & al∣so to set lyght by all these euylles / ye vtter∣ly to dispyse theym / yf god stryke the or mo¦ue the with one of theym / for it is te gyft of god to be moued wyth theym. What true Chrysten is there whiche wold not desyre to be diseased / ye and to dye / whyche seyth and fealeth hym selfe whyle he is hole to be yn synne / and that he may continuelly run¦ne into more and dayly fall in theym / and so to transgresse the specyall and good wil of his most dere father. With thys here and indygnation was Paule vexed and sturred vppe (in the vn∣to the romayns) when he had compleyned that he coud not do to good wicht he wol¦de haue done / but that he dyd the euyll whiche he wolde not haue done / he cryed out. O wretched mā that I am who shal de¦lyuer me frō this bodi of death the grace of
god (he sayde) by Iesus chryst / he doth lytel loue god his father whiche doth not hate more the euill of synne then he doth death / sith that god dyd ordeyn death for this pur¦pose / that it myght at the length fynysshe this euyll of synne / so that deth may be the mynistre of lyfe and ryghtuousnesse / of the whiche we shall speke hereafter. ¶ The thirde chapiter of the thyrdey ma∣ge / whiche is the euyl that is pas¦sed or behind vs. IN thys chiefly / aboue all other doth the swete mercy of god oure father shyne and set forth it selfe whiche is abyll to comforte vs in all veracyon / and ieo∣perdyes. Nether is there any man whiche fealeth the hand of god more ready with hym then when he doth reherse & meditate the yeares of his lyfe past. Saynt Austine sayeth / yf that the choyse were gyuen to a man / that he shulde other dye or elles to lyue hys life passed agayn / as he hath liued it / that he wolde chose rather to dye: seyng his greate ieoperdies & euilles whice (scar¦cely and with great peryll) he hath escaped whiche opynyon is verey true if it be well extemed. Here he may se howe often he hath
done many thinges with out studie and re¦gard / ye clene cōtrary to his purpose. And hath also suffred many thynges with out counceyll and prouision byfore they were done and when they were done / in so mo∣che that (merueyling with hym self) he is cōpelled to saye howe are these thinges co¦me to passe / whiche I neuer thought to do but rather contrary. So that the prouerbe is founde verey true / man purposeth / & god dysposeth / that is to sey bryngeth to passe other thinges then man doth purpose. So that by this one text it is more euidēt then we can denye / that oure life and goodes ar gouerned by the hyghe and merueillous po¦wer / prouision / and goodnesse of god / and not by oure owne wysdome. Here we may perceyue howe oft god hath byn with vs / when we haue nether sene nor felt hym. And howe trewe it is that Pe¦tre sayeth he taketh the charge and prouy∣deth for al vs. Wherfore yf there were ne∣ther bokes nor preachinges / yet oure lyfe hir selfe whiche is ledde thorough so mani perylles and ieoperdies may abundaunt¦ly testyfie and comend vs the godly good∣nesse / most ready and swetist / whiche hath
taken vp and borne vs in his bosom farre beyond all oure prouision and witte. And as Moses in the .xxxij. Deuteronomyon sayeth. The lorde hath kept hym as the ball of hys eye he hath ledde hym about and borne hym on hys shulders. And of this spring all the exhortacions in the psalter / I haue remēbred the olde day∣es. I haue cōsidered in meditacion all the∣se workes & creatures. I shall remembre frō the beginnyng all thy merueilles. And I haue remēbred thy iugemētes & am com¦forted. These & suche other perteyne herun¦to that we maye surely knowe sith that he was them present with vo whē we sawe hym not / nor thought it / that he is also no∣we present with vs / while he semith to vs to be absēt For he that toke vs in suche ne¦cessite with out oure consent wil not forsa¦ke vs in a lytell trouble though he seme to leaue vs / as he sayeth in Esaie. I haue for∣saken the for a mynytte & lytell space / & in greate mercy will gather the agayn & re∣ceyue the. Here maist thou put in these thin¦ges / who was he that toke the charge of vs / so many nyghtes whyle we were sle∣pyng. Who was he that toke thought for
vs as oft as we laboured / played / & dyd in the other infinyte thynges / in the whyche we loke no thought for oure selfe. Or ho∣we long ys the tyme / in the whiche we a∣ke regard to oure selfe The Couetous mā taketh thought to seke money / yet in the se∣king & labouring for it / it is necessary that he put a part hys though. So we may so that all oure care (wether we wil or not) retourneth onely to god / & verey seldome it is that we are left in oure owne prouysi∣on / whyche yet sometyme god doth suffer / that he may lerne vs to knowe his good∣nesse that at the length we may perceyue what grete difference there is bytwene his prouision and ours. So it chaunceth / that he wyll suffer vs sumtyme te be stryken with some lyght dysease / or other euell fay¦nyng as though he holpe vs not (howe be it in dede he dothe euer helpe vs) but yet he forbyddeth that those whyche are ab∣out vs / assaut vs not so fyersly that they suppresse vs / so to tempt vs as hys dere chyldren / whether we wyll commytte to hys prouysyon all the resydue of oure lyfe and to se howe weke & vnproufitable ou∣re care and prouision is / what do we? y /
or what can we proufit oure selfe in al ou¦re life? whiche are not a bill to heale short¦ly a lytell ache in the thyghe: whye then a¦re we so hasty to berydde in a moment frō oure parylles and euilles? and leaue not rather to hym the charge & cure of it / fyth that by hym we are delyuered (oure owne self beryng witnesse) from so many euylles and kept without oure oune {pro}uision. To knowe these thinges is to knowe the wor¦kes of god / to considre and remembre hys workes / and by that remembraunce to be cōforted in all aduersitees. They that kno¦we not this shall runne into the daunger that there is spokē of in the Psalme .xxviij. Bycause they haue not vnderstond the wor¦kes of god and the workes of his hondes thou shalt destroye theym / and not edyfye theym. For they are vnkind to the hole pro∣uision of god gyuen theym in all theyre ly∣fe / whiche in al lytel minycte committe not to hym the hole charge and prouision. ¶The fourth chapitre of the fo∣urth ymage whiche is the euyll beneth vs.
YEt we se none other thing ī al the euilles that we suffer thē that the goodnesse of god is so greate & so redy wt vs that emong the īnume¦rabyl euylles wyth which we are compas∣sed on eueri syde / ye & in whiche we are ful¦li prisoned scāta fewe (nor thei at al times) are suffred to assayle vs / in so moche that the euil wherwith we are sup{pre}ssed is but a warninge of a grete auauntage wt whiche god endueth vs / whyle that he suffreth vs not to be oppressed with the multitude of euilles with the whiche we are beseged. What a myracle is it for a man to bestrykē at on euery syde with infinite strokes / and chaunce at the length to be touched but with one? yee it is a greate grace that he is not stryken with theym all / and a myracle that he is not touchet with many. Ther∣fore the first of those euylles whiche are by neth is death The secunde is hell / yf we shulde consyder the dyuers and vyle deth of other men / wherwith synnars are stry∣ken / we shall sene perceyue wyth howe grete lucre we suffre lesse then oure deser∣uinges. Howe many are strangled wyth halters / galowes / and water / or dye with
swerde / whyche paraduenture haue done moche lesse synnes then we haue done. In so moche that theyre th and mysery may be leyd bifore vs of Christ for an yma¦ge & glasse wheryn we may perceyue / wha∣te we haue deserued For so he answered in the .xiij. of lyke / when there were present that shewed hym of the galyleans whose bloude pylate myngled with theyre owne sacrifice. Suppose ye that these galyleans were gretter synnars then all other galy∣leans bycause they suffred suche punysshe¦ment? I tell you nay / but except ye repent / ye shall all in lyke wise perisshe. Or thyn∣ke ye that those .xviij. Vppon whome the coure in Siloe fill and slewe theym / were synners aboue all men that dwell in Ieru¦salem? I tell you naye / but except ye repēt ye al shall lyke wise perysshe. Nether can we thinke that we ought lesse to be punysshed / whyche haue commytted as great or gretter crymes. Nether the iu¦stice & truthe of god will be for oure cau∣se other vnequall or false / whiche hath or dyned to geue to euery man acordyng to hys dedes / yf we do not preuent and at the lest suffre some lytel euyll pacyently that
is gyuen vs of god most mercyfully for a warnyng / to exchewe the gretest euell. Howe many thousandes are there in hell / and euerlasting dampnation whiche haue not the thousand part of oure synnes: ho∣we many virgyns? chyldren? and whiche we call innocentes? howe many religious prestes? and maryed men? whiche semed tho¦row all theyre lyfe to serue god / & perad∣uenture / falling into one synne are damp¦ned perpetually. We will not dissemble. There is one ryghtuousnesse of god ī eue∣ry synne. He hateth equally & condēpneth synne in who so euer it be founde. May we not here se the inestymable and bounte¦ous mercy of god / whiche hath not damp∣ned vs that so oft haue offended? howe moche I pray the is it that we can suffer in all oure lyfe? to be compared to euerla∣sting payne / whiche they suffer / deseruyng it bone transgression. And yet we whiche haue so oft transgressed are saued. Truely it is a great vnkindnesse and extreme hard¦nesse of vnbeleue / that we so lytell regard and so coldly magnifye these hyghe bene∣fytes of god. Bysydes thys hyther thou mayst applye / so many infydelles / naty∣ons
/ Iewes / infauntes / tho whome if the grace had byn gyuen whiche is gyuē to vs / they shuld not be in hell but in heuyn and shulde moche lesse haue synned thē we ha¦ue. For Crist in the .xi. of Mathewe sth this ymage before oure yes saying / wo be to the Chorosaym / wo be thou. Both sayd for yf the miracles whyche were shewed in you had byn shewed in tyre & Sydon they had repented long a gone in sackeclo the & asshes. Neuerthelesse I say to you it shall be easyer for Tyre and Sidon at the day of iugement then for you. And thou Caphernaum wyiche art lyft vp vnto he∣uyn / shalt bethruft downe vnto hell for yf the myracles whiche haue byn done in the had byn shewed in zodom: they had remai¦ned to this day. Neuerthelesse I say vnto you / it shalbe easier for zodom in the day of iudgement / then for the. We se therfore howe moche prayse & loue we owe vnto oure mercyful god in al the euylles of this lyfe / bycause it is scant one droppe of that we haue deserued. Whiche Iob compareth to the see and the grauell of the see. ¶The fyfte Chapter of the fyfte ymage whiche is the euyll on the lyft hond.
HEre set byfore thyne yies the hole kepe and multitude of aduersaries and euyll men. And first consydre in theym howe many euylles they haue not done / to oure body / goodes / na∣me and soule / whiche they wolde haue do¦ne / except (by the prouisyō of god) they had byn letted. And the hygher any man is in tale & auctorite the more redy at hond he is to be vexed / with the deceytes / souttelty¦es flaunders & tēptacyons of his aduersa∣ryes. And in all these thinges we may vn∣derstonde and proue the honde of god most ready to delyuer vs. And whate merueyll is it though somtyme we be vexed with o∣ne of these euylles? After this cōsyder the euylles whiche are appropryate vnto ou∣re aduersaryes: not to be glad or reioyse in theym / but rather to suffer with theym / and to be sorye for they are subiect indifferent∣ly to these euylles as well as we / as we ha¦ue shewed before. ¶But in this they are more wretched that they are separate from oure company both bodyly and spiritually. This euyll whiche we suffer is nothing to theyrs / for they are in synne in vnbeleue / vnder the
wrath of god vnto the power of the deuell wretched bondmen of vngodlynesse and synne in so moche that yf the hole worlde wolde curse & banne theym: they can desire no worse vnto theym. This well cōside∣red / we shall loue perceyue with howe moche gretter loue we ought to suffer this lytell dysease of the body / in the fayth / in the kyngdome of Christ / and in the seruice of God / whiche in thabundaunce of these cōmodytees and vertues ought scant to be fealt. Theyre mysery also so ought to be so rowed in a Christē and meke hart / that his sorowe seme not to be paynfull / but rather pleasure vnto hym. For so commaundeth Paule in the secunde to the Philippians / let euery man cōsydre not whate is in him selfe / but whate is in other men / let the same mynd be in you whiche was in Christ Ie∣su whiche beyng in the shape of god / toke on hym the shape of a seruaunt / that is to say with a meke and a lowe mynde put on hym oure shape / orderyng hym self none otherwise in oure euylles then yf they had byn his owne. So forgettyng his godhed and other pleasures he made hym selfe of no reputacyon / that he myght be founde in
euery poynt lyke man / separatyng nothing that man had from hym / but onely synne / submyttyng hym self to all other infirmy∣tees. The holy men (streyngthed with this mynde and sturred vp with this ymage) were wont to pray for euyll men / ye and for theyre enemyes. And to do all thinges accorddyng to the example of Christ forget¦tyng theyre owne iniuryes or ryghtuous∣nesse / taking thought howe they shulde de∣lyuer theym from theyre euylles. And with this werre mothe more trouble / then with theyre owne bodyly euylles. As Saynt Petre wrytteth of lot in the secunde Chapitre of the secunde Epistle he beyng ryghtuous / and dwellyng emong theym / in seyng and hearyng / vexed his ryghtuous soule from day / to day with theyr vnryghtuous deades. Here thou seyst whate a depth of euyl∣les appereth and whate occasyon is gyuen to be mercyfull and to suffer with theym / & vtterly to dyspyse oure lytell incōmody∣te / yf the charyte of god be in ve / and howe God will let vs suffer nothing in cōpary∣son to these that they suffer. The cause that these thinges do b tytell moue vs is this
The lye of oure hart is not pure ynough wher with we shulde se howe grete shame and mysery it is for a man to lye vnder syn¦ne / that is to saye to be forsaken of God / & possessed of the deuell. Who is so hard har∣ted that wyll not pytye the myserabyll cō∣dicyon of theym whiche lye before the chur¦che / and in the streates with deformed fa∣ces / theyre noses eaten of / theyr iyes out / & other of theyr membres cōsumed with mat¦ter / fylthe / and corrupcyō / in so moche that the sense can not onely abyde to beholde it / but also the mynde doth abhorre to remem¦bre it. And whate meaneth god by these la¦mentable mōstres of our flessh & lykenesse but to open the iyes of oure mynde that we may perceyue with whate en horrible fa∣cyon the soule of a synnar sheweth out his matter and corrupcyon / though he hym sel¦fe walke in purpyll and in golde / couered with roses / and lylyes / as though he were all redy in paradise. But how many syn∣ners are there in the worlde in cōparyson of one of these deformed persones: Truely these infynite euylles / bothe in gretnesse & in nōbre dispysed ī oure neyghboures doo cause ours (though, it be but one and that
verey small) to seme to vs verey grete & de∣testable. Howe be it also in bodyly tribula¦cyōs they are in worse cōdicyon them we are. For I pray ye what thing can be to theym swete and acceptable (though they had & myght obteyne all thinges that they desired) seyng that theyre cōscience can not be quyet: is there any thing more abhomi¦nable then a grudgyng or byting cōscience For Esaye sayeth in the .lvij. Chaptre: the wicked are as the boyling see / whiche can not be quyet and his floudes do habound into subiection and mourning. And the lor¦de god sayeth / there is not peace (whiche is the verey tranquyllite of conscience) vnto the wicked. Therfore thou mayst se that verefyen in theym whiche is wryten in the xxviij. of Deuteronomyon. The lord shall gyue the a fearefull hart / & deceauyng iyes and a soule cōsumed with sorowe / & thy ly¦fe shall be hangyng before the / & thou shalt feare day and nyght / & thou shalt not trust thy lyfe / in the morning thou shalt say who shall geue me the euentyde. And in the eue¦nyng / who shall geue me the mornyng? Bi¦cause of the feare of thy hart / for thou wal be feared / & for those thinges whiche thou
shalt see with thyne yies. Fynally he that dyd consyder with a good mynde the vtter¦most poynt of euylles / other of his enemy∣es or of his frendes / he wolde not onely forget his owne troubles thinkyng hym selfe that he suffred no thing / but wolde al¦so with Moyses and thappostell Paule breke out and desire that it myght be leful for hym to dye for theym and to be made cursed frō Christ / & to be put out of the bo¦ke of lyfe (as it is wryten in the .ix. to the Romayns) that they myght be delyuered and saued. Christ burnyng with this syre and loue both dyed and went downe to hell for vs leuyng vs an example that we also shulde take thought for other mennes harmes / forgettyng oure owne / ye rather desyring oure owne. ¶The syxte Chapitre of the syxt ymage whiche is the euyll on the ryght honde. ON oure ryghte honde are oure fren∣des by whose euylles and vexations oure troubles are mitygated and aswaged as Saynte Petre teachet in the fyft of the fyrst Pistle sayenge. Resyst the deuell stede¦fast in the fayth / remembryng that ye do but fulfyll the same affliccions / whiche are
appoynted to youre bretheren that are in the worlde. So the cōgregacyon of christē areth in theyre prayers / that they prouoked be the examples of holy men / maye folowe the vertue of theyre passyons / and syngeth solemply / that the holye men haue suffered turmentes / that they myght suerly come to the victorye of martyrdome. By the which wordes and songes of the church we must vnderstōd that the passyons and victoryes that God hath gyuen to his martyres and holy sayntes / ought to be had in memory / that by theyre example we may be quyke∣ned and bolded to suffer those euylles whi¦che they suffred. And yf theyre commemo∣racyon be by vs done to any other entent / whatsoeuer it be / then is it medled with supersticyon & hypocrisie. As is theyrs that honoure theym to thintent that they shul∣de not suffer the trouble & vexacyō / whiche the sayntes by theyr example & memory do teache to be suffred / so that they desire to be made vnlyke vnto theym / whose feastes they celebrate. Right excellētlye doth thap¦postle entreate this place of cōfort in the .xij to the Heb. sayēge: ye haue not yet resysted vnto bloud shedīge striuīge ageynst synne
And ye haue forgotten the consolacyon / whiche speaketh vnto you as vnto chyl∣dern. My sonne despyse not the chastenyn¦ge of the lorde / nether saynt when thou art rebuked of hym: for whō the lorde loueth hym he chasteneth. If ye shall endure cha∣stenynge god offereth hym selfe vnto you / as vnto sonnes / what sonne is that whome the father chasteneth not? Yf ye be not vn∣der correccyō (wherof al ar parte takers) them are ye bastardes and not sonnes. Moreouer seyng we haue fathers of oure flesshe whiche corrected vs / and we gaue theyme reuerence: shall we not moch ra∣ther be in subieccyon vnto the father of spi¦rituall gyftes / and lyue? No maner lernyn∣ge for the present tyme semych to be ioyous but greuous / neuerthelesse afterward it bryngeth forthe the quyet frute of ryght∣uousnesse vnto theym / whiche there in are exercysed. These were the wordes of saynt Paule. Who wolde not be abasshed of the¦se wordes / where he diffyneth playnely / that they are not the sonnes of god / whiche are not vnder his lernyng and correccyon Who can more strongly be cōfirmed / & mo∣re effectuouslye be cōforted / then he that hea¦reth
that they are loued of god whiche are chastened / and that they are the sonnes of god / and endued with the cōmunyon of ho¦ly men / ye they onely are holy whiche suffer and are chastened. This vehement exhorts¦cyō shulde make sufferaunce and correccy∣on to be loued and desyred. Here is no pla¦ce to excuse oure selfe / that some suffer lesse some more for to euery man is gyuen temp¦tatiō by measure / not aboue oure streynght as it is wrytten in the .lxxix. psalme. Thou shalt fede vs with the brede of teares / and geue vs drinke in theares / in measure / whi¦che Paule doth also saye. God is faithfull whiche suffereth you not to be tempted / for ther thē ye be able: ye he wyll put such cha∣unce vnto the temptacyon that ye may be able to resyst. Therfore where as the gret∣ter euyll and temptacyō is / there is the mo¦re cōfort and helpe of god. So that the in∣equalyte of trouble and temptacyō is but onely in the face outwardly and not in the verey thinge. When we nowe at this daye remembre Iohn Baptist shamefully slayne & behedded of Herode / doth it not cōfound vs and make vs abasshed? that he beyng su¦che one (as emōg the chyldren of wymen
there arose not a greter) the onely frende of the spouse the prepare of christes wae / gretter them all the prophetes / was nether slayne by any open iugement / nether yet for any fayned cause (as Christ was accused) nether for to auoyd insurreccyon of the peo¦ple. But was beheded in pryson at the ap∣petyte of a dauncetesse / the doughter of a wretched aduoutrous woman. Let then the shameful deth / of suche an holy persone suche an holy lyfe of suche a Prophete / so wretchedly and vilaynously delyuered in∣to the cruell hōdes of a rybaud that was angry with hym swage and pacyfye al our euyll / where was god whiche suffered euē before his eyes such an horrible dede? Whe¦re was Christ whiche hearyng of it spake neuer a worde? He dyed as though he had byn vnknowen to god / men and all creatu¦res. What suffer we in the whiche we may reioyce? and not rather be vtterly confoun¦ded and asshamed yf it be compared vnto this mannes dethe. Or howe shall we be bold to shewe oure faces / yf we wyll suf∣fer nothynge / syth suche holye men haue suf¦fered suche vyle deth without deseruyng / ye and theyre bodyes after theyre deth hath
ben made a laughing stocke to theyre ene∣myes. Behold (sayeth Ieremyas) they whi∣che had no iugement to drynke of the cup∣pe / drinkyng shall drynke of it / & shalt thou be lest innocent? thou shalt not be lefte in¦nocent / but drynking thou shalt drinke of it. Therfore the heremyte dyd well whiche because he was wont euerye yere to haue sykenesse / and scaped one hole yere without sykenesse / was very sadde & wepte / sayng that God had forgotten hym / & had denyed hym his grace. So necessary and holsome is the correccyon of the lorde to all christē Here we se howe it is nothing that we suf¦fer / yf we cōpare it to the prisons / Iron / fy¦re / bestes / water / and other infynite tor∣mentes / ye yf we ponder well the greuous persecutyons of theym whiche suffer the temptacyons of the deuell beynge present with vs in this lyfe. For there are manye whiche are suffer more sharply and gre∣uouslye them we do / bothe in sprete and bo¦dye. Here some man wyll say in this I cō∣pleyne / that my passyon cannot be compa¦red to the passyons of holy men / bycause I am a synner / not worthy to be compared vnto theym.
They suffered gylties and for innocen∣cye but I suffer for my synnes / therfore it s no merueyle though they suffered all thyn∣ges pacyently and gladly. This saying is verey folisshe / for yf thou suffer for thy syn¦nes thou mayst reioyce that thy synnes be purged. Where not the holy men also syn∣ners? but thou fearest lest thou be lyke vn¦to Herode or to these whiche honge on the left honde. Thou art not yf thou be pacyent / what thīg maketh the differēce bytwene the the¦fe on the ryght hōde & the thefe on the left hōde? but onely paciēce & impaciēt? Yf thou be a synnar / well / the thefe was also a syn∣ner / howe be it his pacyence obtayned the glory of ryghtuousnesse and holynesse. So do thou lyke wyse / for thou cāst not suffer but other for thy synnes / or for ryght¦uousnesse / and bothe these suffrynges make the holy & blessed / yf thou loue theym. Wher¦fore thou hast none excuse left. Finally as thou doest cōfesse / that thou suffryst iustly for thy synnes / thou arte ryghtuouse and ho¦lye as the thefe on the ryghthonde. The knoweleging of thy synne / because it is tru¦the dothe iustifye and make the holy. And
euē then immediatly (after this knowele∣gyng of thy synne) thou doest not suffer for thy synne / but for thy truthe and innocency For a ryghtuous man can not suffer / but for the truthe and innocently. Nowe art thou iustifyed by the knoweleginge of thy synne / and suffering pacyently. Therfore (and that truely and worthyly) is thy pas∣syon and suffering to de cōpared to the suf¦feryng of the sayntes euen as the knowele¦gyng of thy synnes is to be cōpared vnto theyrs. For there is but one truthe of all men the knouwelegyng of synne / sufferyng pacyently of all euylles / and true cōmuny¦on of holy men in all and by all thinges, ¶The seuenth Chaptre of the seuenth ymage whiche is the euyll aboue vs. IN this last ymage we must lifte vp ou¦re hart and assence vp in to the moun¦tayne of Myrthe with the spouse. Here is Iesus Chryst crucifyed the hed of all chry∣sten / the capteyn of all theym that suffer / of whome many haue wryten many thinges And all men (as it is cōuenyent) haue wry¦ten all thinges. His memorye is cōmended vnto the spouse / where as it is sayde. Put e as a sygne vpon thyne arme. The bloud
of this lambe marked on the post doth put awey the stryking aungell. The spouse of hym is commended / because her here is ly∣ke the purpure of a kyng. That is her me∣ditacyon is redde and of purpure coloure by remembryng the passyō of Christ. This is the wodde that Moyses was commaun¦ded to put in to the waters of Marath (that is to say / the bitter passions) and they were made swete. There is nothīg but this passyon maketh it swere / ye deth. As the spouse doth say his lyppes are lylyes distil∣lyng the chief and pure Myrrhe. What pro¦porcyon is there bytwene lylyes and lyp∣pes? syth these are redde and they whyte. Truely it is spoken mystycally / bycause his wordes are most whyte / and pure in the whiche is no bloude bytternesse of enuye or malyce / but they are swete and mylde / with the whiche (neuerthelesse) he doth di∣styll the most pure and chief myrrhe / that is to say / persuadeth most bitter death / whi∣che (euen as the most pure and chiefe Mir∣rhe at one taketh awey all corrupcyō and stynking of the body) taketh awey the cor∣rupcyon and stynking of synne. Of grete power are these most swettest lyppes that
are able to make the most bitter deth / swe¦te / pure / whyte and acceptable. But howe shall this be done? Truely whyle thou he∣rest that Iesu Christ the sonne of god hath (by his most holy touching and passyon) consecrate and halowed all oure euylles / and suffrynges / ye the deth it selfe most ex¦tremest and grettest of all other / hath blys¦sed the curse / glorifyed the slaunder made ryche the pouertye / so that deth is compel∣led to be the gate of lyfe / Curse / the begyn∣nyng of blyssyng. And slaunder the father of glorie / howe canst thou nowe be so harde & vnkynde? that thou wilt not both loue ye & also desy∣re all passyōs & troubles / whiche are deped & purified in the most clene & holy flesshe & bloude of Christ / & so made vnto the holy / innocent / holsome / blessed / & glorifyed. For yf he (by the touchinge of his clene flesshe) hath halowed al waters for baptesme ye al creatures. Howe moche more bi the touchī¦ge of his moste pure flesshe & bloude had he sanctified al dethes / all passiōs / al iniuries all curses / al slaunders / for the baptesme of the sprete or bloude? As he sayeth of the sa∣me baptesme or passyō in the .xij. of Luke.
I must be baptysed with a baptesme / & ho∣we I am payned tyll it be ended? Thou seest how he is payned howe he pantith / how he thirsteth to sanctifye and make lo∣ued passyon and deth. For he seeth that we are feared with passyons / he seeth that deth is feared and abhorred. Wherfore he (as a most meke sheperd / and most faythfull phi¦siseō) goyng aboute to cure oure euyl / doth hast and is payned vntyll his dye that by his deth he myght make theym acceptable & welcome to vs. So that the deth of a Chri¦sten is to be counted lykē to the brasen ser¦pent of Moses which in all poyntes had the facyon of a serpent / but it was clene with∣out lyfe / without mouyng / without veno∣me / without bytyng. So the ryghtuous do apere to theym that a soles to dye / howe be it they lyue in peace. We are like to thinges which dye / Nether is there any other face outwardly of oure deth then of the deth of other thinges. Howe be it the thinges in de¦de are other wyse. For to vs deth is deed. Lykewyse all oure other troubles and ve∣xacyons are lyke the troubles of other thī¦ges / but that is onely in the face outward∣ly. For in very dede oure sufferynges at the
begynning of impassibilite / euen as deth is the begynnynge of lyfe. And this is it that Ihon speaketh of in the viij. If a man kepe my sayenges / he shall neuer so deth. How shal he not se deth Tru¦ely for dying he begynneth lyfe. So that for the lyfe whiche he seeth he can not see deth / here the nyght as the day shall belyghte∣ned / for there is moche more clere lyght of the lyfe whyche we begynne then there is of the lyfe from whyche we be exyled by deth. And all these thynges are confyrmed and stablisshed to theym whiche beleue in Christ / but it is contrary to theym that be¦leue not Therfore if thou kysse / loue / and embrace the cote of Chryst vesselles / water pottes / and suche other that Christ did tou¦che and vse / countyng theym grete and swe¦te relykes / as though they were consecra∣ted & halowed by this thouchyng / whye doest thou not moche more loue / embrace and kysse / the paynes & euylles of this worl¦de slaunder and deth? whiche were not one¦ly halowed by his touching / but also clen∣sed and blissed in his pure bloude / ye and embraced with the will of his hert / his en¦famming charyte and mercy mouing hym
therunto / seyng that in these are moche gre¦ater merytes / rewardes / and goodnesse / thē in those relykes for in these are obsteyned for the / the victory of deth and heel / and of all synnes / and so is it not in the relyques. O that we myght se / and beholde the hert of Chryst / when that hangyng on the cros¦se he was payned to make death deade and despysed howe feruently / & swetely he to∣ke vppon hym paynes and deth for vs that were feerfull and dyd abhorre paynes and deth howe gladly he began to drynk thys cuppe to vs that were dyseased / that we shulde not feare after hym to drynke syth we do so that there chaunced none euyll to hym but onely good by rysing agayn. No doubt chat chyef & pure myrrhe (Cry¦stes lyppes distillyng it and his wordes cō¦mending it) shulde be moste acceptable ād swete euen as the smell of lylses So writeth Petre in the fyrste pystle for asmuche as Chryst hath suffer for vs in flesshe Arme your selues lykewyse with the same mynde Paule also in the .xij. to the Hebrues. Con¦syder howe that he endured suche spea∣king agaynst hym of synners / lest ye shulde be weryed ēd saynt in your myndes. Ther¦fore
yf we haue lerned in the ymages by¦fore (whiche were byneth vs and nere vn¦to vs) to suffer euylles paciently / cruely in this last ymage which is set aboue vs we (being rauysshed in christ lyft vp and set hy¦gher them all euylles) ought not onely to suffer theym / but also to loue / desyre and se¦ke theym. And the ferther of that a man is frome this mynde & desyre / the lesse he hath of Christes passion. As they which vse the sygnes and armure of Christ against euyl∣les and deth / that they might nether suffer nether dye / whyche desires are clene con∣trary to the crosse and deth of Christ wher¦fore it is necessary that what euylles so e∣uer we suffer be consumed & clene brought to nought in this seuenth ymage / so that it shulde not greue vs but rather delite vs and make vs glad yf this ymage perse and entre in to oure hers / or do remayn and sure in oure inward desire and mynde. ¶This mothe haue we spoken of the fyrst table. Nowe foloweth the secunde. TO the secunde table we shal also as¦sygne seuē ymages contrarye to they me that were made bifore. The first shall
be of the inward goodnesse. The secunde of the goodnesse to come. The thyrd of the goodnesse passed, The fourth of the good∣nesse beneth vs. The fyft of the goodnesse on the lyft honde. The syxt of the goodnes¦se on the ryght honde. The ses venthe of the goodnesse aboue vs. ¶The first chapter of the fyrst ymage whi¦che is the goodnesse with in vs. WHo is a bill to numbre the good¦nesse whyche euery man posses∣seth in his owne person? fyrst ho¦we grete are the gyftes of the bo¦die? as beutye streinght helt / q̄cknesse / witte & besydes these in the male the most {per}fai & noble kynde & nature / by the whyche he is mete to exercyse and take vpon hym many thinges priuate / comune and other excellēt actes / whiche woman is nothing mete nor apt to / whathe merueyle is it / yf thou vsing these giftes (thorough the fauoure of god) cenne twenty / or thyrty yere with pleasure shuld suffer & be payned in one of theym for the space of tēne dayes? whate shal we do whiche haue had manye good houres /
and will not be cōtent to suffer one euell? here may we se howe we be endued by he∣pe with the goodly giftes of god. And aga¦yn with howe fewe euylles many of vs be oppressed or touched. Howe be it god almyghtye (not thynking it sufficiēt to haue done this moche for vs) dyd also cast vnto vs rychesse & plenteous abundaunce of all thinges / though not to all men yet truely to many / & to theym spe∣cially that are impotent & weake to suffer euyll for (as I sayde bifore) to theym he gy¦ueth more of the sprete / to whome he gaue lesse worldly & bodyly goodes that there shuld be a certeyn equalite in all thynges & he the ryghtuouse iuge of al thinges. Ne¦ther do grete rychesse so moche comfort a man as a mery & glad sprete. Bisides this / to some he gyueth yssue & children (whiche is a grete pleasure) power / imperye / hono∣ur a name / glory / fauoure / and suche other whyche yf a man vse a longe season (ye though he vse theym but a smal season) they shall sone declare vnto hym whate he shal do in a lytell euyll. The gyftes of the soule are more excelēc then all these as witte / connyng iudgemēt
eloquence / wysdom / and these also (as he dyd the other) he deuideth after an equaly¦te so that he hath recompensed it in the o∣ther / by gyuing theym more quietnesse and gladnesse of mynde. In all these thynges the most liberall hond of god must be considered with gy∣uyng thankes and oure infirmite must be comforted that in this multitude and gret¦nesse of goodes we merueyl not / though so¦me sowernesse be admyxt / for vnto volup∣tuous men / there is no meate acceptable whiche of his nature hath not other some sharpe tast / or elles hys sawce prepared for hym / so that contynuall and onely swetnes¦se is a thing intollerabill. Therfore it was well sayd euery pleasure by his perseuera¦unce maketh a man full of it / and to disda∣yn it. And agayn / it is said. Euen pleasure hir self is a payne: bycause this lyfe is to we¦ke and impotent to suffre cōtinually good¦nesse without the temperature of euyll for the abūdant copie of the goodnesse wherof spryngeth thys prouerbe. Theyre bones must be strong whyche shall suffer good dayes whiche prouerbe I haue often con¦sidered merueyling at the merueylous true
sentence of it / & howe all the purposes and desires of men are clene contrary vnto it / whyche seke nothyng but good dayes / ye when they haue gotte theym they can wor¦se bere theym thē the euyll. For whāte doth god cōmend vnto vs in those thinges / but that the crosse shulde be merueylous / euen in the enemyes of the crosse: Insomoche that we ought to tempore and halowe all thynges by it / euen as we powdre flesshe with salte that it do not putrifie & wareful of wormes werfore thē do not we receyue with a glad hert / thys temperature sent of god / whyche yf he dyd not sente / yet oure ly¦fe whiche is not able to endure with thys contynuall pleasure and goodnesse / wolde desire it of his owne will. Nowe we per∣ceiue howe truely the wise mā sayed of god he that contynueth from the one ende to the other strongly / and dysposeth all thyn∣ges swetely / for yf we consider these good thynges / it shall appere that it is also true whiche is spoken of Moses in the. xxxij. of Deuteronomyon / he bare hym Vppon hys shulders / he ledde hym ab∣out and kept hym as the balle of hys eye wyth thys saying we may stoppe theyre
mouthes whyche vnkyndly chatter that there are mo euilles in this lyfe them good thynges for surely / we neuer lacke good∣nesse nor pleasures / full of proufit & swet∣nesse: but we do moche lacke suche people as shuld vnderstond it with the Prophete saying. The Erthe is full with the mercy of god. And agayn: the erth is full of hys prayse / & in the .ciij. psal. The erth is reple∣nysshed with thy possession / thou hast dely¦ted me Lorde in tese creatures for this cau¦se we syng dayly in the masse: heuyn & erth are full of thy glorye / why so? for there are many good thinges for the whiche he shul¦de be praysed / but that is onely of theym whiche se this fulnesse and replenysshyng for euyn as we sayde of the euylles in the first ymage / that euery mannes euyll was so greate as hys opynyon / and knowelege was in it. Euen so good thynges though they come on vs on euery syde and in a ma¦ner suppresse vs / yet are they no gretter them they are extemed / for all that god ma¦de be verey good / howe be it they be not knowen so of all men. Of this ymage / Iob gyueth vs a fayre & most proufitable example / whyche (when
all his goodes were taken a way) sayde / yf we haue taken goodnesse of the hond of the Lorde whye shall we not also suffer euylles? truely it was a goodly sayng and a myghty comfort in temptacion / for he dyd not onely suffer but was also tempted by his wife to ympacyence / saying vnto hym wilt thou yet perseuer in this innocency? curse the Lorde and dye / for it is manyfest that he is not god whyche so doth forsake the / why them doest thou trust in hym and not rather denye hym / and curse hym / and so to knowelege thy selfe mortall / to who¦me after this lyfe nothyng is remaynyng. These and suche other to euery man hys owne wyfe (whyche is sensualyte) doth prompt and shewe in temptacyon / for the sense sauoureth not that thyng whyche per¦teyneth to god howebeit all these thinges are bodyly goodes / and comen to all men. But a Chrysten man precelleth in other in¦warde goodes which are farre better that is to say in the fayth of Chryst / of the why∣che it is spoken in the .xl. Psalme. All hys glorye is of the kynges doughter whyche is withyn in borderes of gold cumpassed about with varyete. And as we haue spo∣ken
of the euyll of the fyrst ymage / that the¦re can be sene no euyll so grete in a man / but there is a moche worse in hym whiche he can not se. Euyn so the best of all the good thinges that be in a Christen he hym self can not se nor iudge / for yf he dyd per∣ceyue it he shulde be then in heuen / bycau∣se the kyngdome of heuen (as sayeth Chry∣ste) is withyn vs for he that hath faith hath the truth and word of god / & he that hath the worde of god hath god hym self the ma¦ker of all thinges. If these goodes were re¦uelat vnto the soule that he myght feale the botom of theym as they be in verey de∣de / he wolde sone be dissolued from the bo∣dye / for thabundaunce of that swetnesse. wherfore all other goodes art as it were a monysshyng of those goodes (that we ha¦ue withyn vs) whiche he wolde by theyme shulde be shewed vnto vs / bycause thys ly¦fe is not a byll to abyde the glorye of ther yf they were shewed forth. Therfore they are mercyfully hydden of god vntyll they a¦re encreased to theyre perfit state / euen as louing fathers do gyue vnto theyre chyl∣dren sometyme lytell gyftes to play wyt∣hall / wherby they may entyce the myndys
of theyre chyldren to trust for gretter thyn¦ges. Howe be it sometyme they shewe theim selfe and come forth when that the consci∣ence (reioysing / doth cōmytte hym self hol∣ly vnto got / speaketh gladly of hym / hereth his worde swetely & deuoutly / is redy and glad to serue hym / to do good workes / to suffer euylles / and suche other / whiche all are tokens of an infinite and incōparabill goodnesse lying with in / whyche sendeth out thēse swete droppes by a lytell at ones though sumtyme it, chaunce that it be fer∣ther reuelate to soules whyche fall to con¦templacyon / in so moche that they are ma∣de dronkē with it / and can not tell where they are. As S. Augustine & his mother do confesse of theym selues / and many other. ¶The secunde Chapter of the secun¦de ymage whiche is / the goodnesse to come / or byfore hym. THey that are not Christen can take but small comfort of the goodnesse to come / bycause to theym all thynges are vncerteyn for this affect whyche is called hope (by the whyche we are commaunded after mannes confortyng to trust euer for
the best / bithe whiche we take greate ma∣ters in honde trustyng to bryng theym to oure purposse (doth of ten tymes) ye and in a maner alweyes / deceyue vs. As Chryst doth teache in the .xij. of luke of the ryche mā whiche said to his soule. I wil distroy my barnes and bylde gretter / and theryn will I gadre all my frutes and all my goo¦des / and will saye vnto my soule: Soule thou hast moche goodes leyd vp in store for many yeares / take thyne ease / eate / drin¦ke / & be mery. But god said vnto hym: thou sole this nyght will they fetche awey thy foule agayne frō the / then whose shall tho is thinges be whiche thou hast prouyded? So is it with hym that gathereth rychesse and is not ryche in god. Nether yet hath god left the sones of men so / but doth confort theym by a hole suer and perfait hope / that they shall ouer come theyre euilles and obteyne goodnesse And though they be vncertein where good¦nesse t is that shall come / yet they hope styll wythout doubt / by the whyche hope they are susteyned / lest (by falling ynto des∣peratyon) they shulde not be able to suffer theyre present euyll / & so to do worse wher¦fore
this affect of hope whiche is in tempo¦rall thinges is gyuen the of god / not taht he wold haue the stykke therin / but to pro∣cede vnto the hole suer / and parfayt hope whiche is onely vnto hym. And for thys cause god is lūg sufferyng that be may brīg vs to repentaunce / As paule sayeth in the ij. to the Romains. Nether will he suffer that all men be deceyued in this vnperfit & deceytful hope whithe is in worldly ma¦ters / but that they retorne and take the par¦fait and vnfayned hope whiche is in hym. There are bysides these goodes to the Christē .ij. great goodes whiche they shall suerly haue but not without deth and suffe¦ryng for they haue also the comon hope that we spake of / concernyng the fynyshing of theyre present euyll & encreasing of the cō∣trary good / although they do not so gretely regard that / as they do in the increasyng of theyre owne proper good / whiche is the truthe in Christ in the whiche they do pro¦cede from day to day / for the wiche they do both liue and hope. But bysides these as I sayde / there ys .ij. chyef whiche shall come in deth. The fyrst is that in deth is fynys∣shed all the tragedy of the euylles in thys
lyfe / as it is wryten Precio{us} is in the sight of god / the deth of his sayntes. And agayn in peace I shall bothe slepe and rest. And a ryghtuous man yf he be subdewed of deth he shall be in colenesse. And contrary to theyme that are wyked / deth is the begyn∣nyng of euyll. As it is saide the death of syn¦ners is worst / and euylles shall take an e∣uell man in hys deth. So Lazarus shall be comforted whyche hath receyued here his euylles / where as the gloton shall be punysshed bycause he hath receyued here his goodes. So it feloweth that a chrysten whether he die or lyue is euer in better takyng / suche a blissed thyng is it to be a chrysten and to beleue in chryst wherfore as Paule saieth To lyue it is Chryst to me / and to dye it is auauntage / and in the .xiiij. to the Roma. he that lyueth he lyueth to god / and he that dyeth he dyeth to god / whether we ly∣ue therfore or dye we are the lordes. This surenesse hath christ obteyned for vs bycause that he died and rose agayn / that he shulde be lorde both of quykke and dede whiche was a bill to make vs sure bothe in life & deth as the prophete sayeth in the,
xxij. psalme: If I walke in the myddes of the shadowe of deth I will not feare euil¦les bicause thou art with me. And yf that this adauaūtage of deth do but lytell mo¦ue vs / it is a signe that oure faith in Christ is verey weke with vs / for he that doth not well exteme the pryce and value of a good deth / or elles that deth is good / he doth not yet beleue but is ouer moche letre by the ol¦de adam / and the wysdome of the fllesshe yet reynyng in hym / we must therfore la∣boure that we may be promoted to kno∣we and loue thys benefyte of deth. It is a greate thyng that death (whiche is to o∣ther the greatest euyll) is made to vs the greatest auauntage / and except that Cryst had gotten that for vs / whate grete thyng had he done by gyuyng hym selfe for vs. Truely it was a godly worke that he dyd therfore it was no merueyle to hym to ma¦ke the euyll of deth most proufitable for vs Therfore deth is nowe dede to faythfull men / and hath nothyng to be feared for / but hys visar and outward face. And ys euyn lyke to a serpent whyche ys kylled for he hath the ferefull shape that he had byfore / howe be it yn verey dede
there is nothing left but the figure / the euil is dede / and can do no more harme. And as in the .xxi. of Numery God cōmaunded the brasen serpent to be lyft vp by whose sight the quykke serpentes dyd perisshe. Lykewi¦se oure deth by the faithfull beholdyng of the deth of Christ doth perisshe and doth not nowe appere but a certeyn figure of deth. So the mercy of God hath figured all thinges to vs that are weke / that he hath destroyed the power of deth / and (by∣cause it can not be vtterly put awey) hath made it but a verey figure / for the whiche cause it rather called slepe inscripture then deth. The secunde goodnesse of deth is that it doth not onely fynisshe the euilles & pay∣nes of this life / but also (whyche is letter) it maketh an ende of all vice and synne the whiche to theym that be good faithful ma¦keth deth moche more to be desyred then these present goodes wherof we haue spo∣ken / for the euilles of the soule (whiche are synnes) are without cōparison worse thē the euylles of the body. These onely sinnes (yf we dyd sauoure theyme) wolde make deth verey acceptable and loued vnto vs /
whiche thyng yf they do not / it is a sygne that we do not wel perceyue nor hate the euylles of oure soule. Therfore sith thys lyfe is full of perylles / and that synne doth besge vs on euery syde / and sith we can not lyue without synne / deth is best and most expedient whiche loseth vs from the seperilles / and cutteth synne clene awey from vs therfore in the prayse of a ryghtu∣ouse man it is spokē / in the .iiij. of Sapien¦ce. He that pleased god is made beloued / & he (lyuing emong synners) is translated & rauysshed / that malice shulde not chaunge his vnderstōding / nether that fayning shul¦de deceyue his soule for the bewitching of tryfeling doth darken goodnesse / & the vn∣stablenesse of concupiscēce doth ouerwhel¦me the witte wyth out malyce (O howe true these wordes are and dayly ene) it is fone roted and hard to be dystroyed. But his soule pleased god and for that he hasted to bryng hym out from the myddes of ini∣quite. Euen so (thorough the mercy of god) deth whiche was to man the payne of syn¦ne made to the chrysten the ende of synne and the begynning of lyfe and ryghtuous∣nesse wherfore it is necessary that he whi∣che
louith lyfe and ryghtuousnesse shulde not abhorre deth (whiche is the minyster & gate of theym both) but rather to loue it / or elles he can neuer come to lyfe & ryght∣uousnesse / and he that can not loue it / let hym pray god that he may. For therfore a∣re we taught to say / thy will be fulfilled / because we (whiche fearing deth do rather fauoure & loue synne then iustice) of oure power be not abyl to fulfil it. And that god dyd ordeyn deth to be the destruccyon of synne / it maybe gathered of this / that after synne he put deth vppon Adam by and by / ye byfore he cast hym for the of Paradise / to thintēt to shewe vs that deth shuld wor¦ke none euyl but all goodnesse toward vs syth it was put on hym (as a penaunce and satisfaction) in paradice. Truth it is that by the enuy of the deuil deth entered into al the worlde / but in this was declared the hyghe and godly goodnes¦se toward vs / that it was ordyned euen at his first begynnyng / not to hurte vs but to be the payne and destruction of synne to ou¦re grete proufit. This was signyfyed when be had tolde Adam byfore in the precept / that what houre so euer he dyd tast of that
frute he shulde dye / yet after the trāgression he dyd moderate the extremyte and rygou∣re of the precept / nether dyd he speke one syllable of deth / but sayde onely. Thou art erth / and shalt retourne into erth / vntyll thou come ageyne into the lond out of the whiche thou art taken. And (as though he had hated deth) wolde not vouthesaus o∣nes to name it / according to the Prophete layng / for there is wrathe in his indigna∣cyon and lyfe in his wyll. And semed so to speke / that except deth had byn necessary to the distruction of synne he wolde neuer ha¦ue put it vpon man / no / nether yet haue na¦med it. ☞ Euen so ageynst synne whiche brought forth deth / the prouysyon of God dyd so arme deth / that here thou mayst se fulfylled the saying of the Poete. The maker of deth / dyd perisshe by his owne worke / and synne was distroyed and kyl∣led by his owne proper frute (that is to say deth) whiche he begat he hymself / euen as a viper by hyr owne you frute. This is a goodly syght to se howe deth is distroyed / not by an others worke / but by his owne. As Goliath had his he destroy en of wih his owne swerde For Goliath
was the figure of synne / a terrybill gyaunt to all men / except to lytell Dauid (that is to say to Christ) whiche alone dyd ouer throwe hym / and cutting of his hede with his owne swerde sayde: there can not be a¦ter swerde then Golyath hath hym selfe. If then we do remembre these ioyes of the vertue of Christ and the gyftes of his grace / whate shall a lytell euyl vexe vs? syth in that great euyll to come we se so grete pro¦fites and commodytees. ¶ The thyrd chapter of the .iij. ymage whi¦che is the good that is passed or behinde vs THe cōsyderacyon of this good whi¦che is passed may sone be gathe∣red by his cōtrary ymage whiche we spake last of howe be it we will helpe (in this also) hym that desyreth to loke on it. Saynt Austyne in this thing is a grete doar / in his cōfessyōs / where he doth wel recite the benefites of god towar¦des hym / frō the wōbe of his mother. That doth also the excellent psalme. Lorde thou hast proued me / where emong all other he merueyling at the prouidēce of god sayeth Thou hast vnderstōd my thoughes a far∣re of my path / and my downe lyinges thou
hast serched / as though he wolde say / wha∣te so euer thing I haue thouht / and what so euer I haue wrought / or howe moche so euer I shulde obtayne and possesse / nowe I perceyue that it is not done by my witte and polecye / but that they were ordyned by thy prouisyon lōge byfore this tyme / final∣ly. Thou hast sene before all my wayes / & there is no worde in my tongue. Wherin then? in thy power. This we lerne by oure owne experien∣ce / for yf we remembre oure lyfe whiche is passed / shall we not merueyle / that we ha∣ue thought / wylled / done and sayde suche thinges as we coude not se byfore? howe shulde we haue brought theyme to passe / yf we had byn left to oure owne will and power? And nowe fyrst we perceyue and se that his care was so ready with vs / and his prouision so cōstaunt vpon vs / that we coude nether speke / wyll / nor thinke / but that whiche he had gyuen vs. As it is spokē Sapience .vij. for in his hond are both we & oure workes. And Paule / whiche wor∣keth all thinges in all men / whye then are not we (so insensyble and harde arted) a shamed? whiche (thaugh by oure owne ex∣perience)
do e howe carefull the lord hath byn for vs vnto this day / and hath gyuen vs all goodes: and yet cannot fynde in ou¦re hertes to gyue vnto hym the same char¦ged ouer vs in a lytell tryfill / but ordre ou∣re selfe so folishely as though he had forsa¦ken vs / or elles myght forsake vs / doth not the Psalme say on this maner? I truely am edy and poore / the lord taketh thought for me. Saynt Austyne sayeth. Let hym ta∣ke charge on the whiche made the / whiche prouided for the / before thou were. Howe can it be that he shall not prouide for the whiche art a man / syth he prouided for the to be a mā. But thou wilt say we haue the rule of oure selfe as well as god / we graun¦te vnto hym that he made vs (and that scar¦cely) but we haue in oure power the charge of oure selfe / as who sayeth: he made vs / & and by and by went his wey / leuyng vs in oure owne power to rule and ordre oure selfe. ☞ And yf that oure wysdome and prouysyon do let vs / that we can not per∣ceyue this workyng of God / whyle that par aduenture many thynges do chaunce after oure purpose / yet ones turne thy∣ne yie and loke vpon the Psalme whiche
sayeth: My bone is not hyd from the / whiche thou madest in secrete / that is to say. Thou dydest se and facyō my bones in my mothers bely when I was not / when my mother dyd not yet knowe whate was made in her / and my substaunce in the ne∣der partes of the erth / that is to say / the fi∣gure and facyon of my body in the lowest bowelles of my mother was not hydde frō the / for thou didest make it. Whate meaneth he by these wordes? but to shewe vs by this greate example / whate care god hath euer taken for vs? who can glorye that he wrought with god and holy to make him selfe in his mothers bely? Who gaue the mother charge to geue vs myske / to nouris¦she vs / to loue vs / and to exercyse all mo∣therly dewetyes to vs when that we dyd not yet feale oure lyfe? Of this shulde we knowe nothing except we had sene it do∣ne in other / and so therby beleue that we were euen so ordered, Nether shulde we ha¦ue any memory of theym that they were do¦ne to vs / no more them yf they had byn do¦ne to theym that slepe / ye or be deed / and ra¦ther not yet borne / for asmoche as concer∣nyth oure knowelege and memory.
Here we se that without oure helpe the goodly mercyes and cōfortes be mynistred vnto vs. Do we yet doubt and dispeyre to cōmyt the cure and custody of vs vnto hī. Yf this experience do not moue & instruct man / I wot not whate wyll moue him / for we do se this comynly in all yong chyldren set byfore oure yies / so that so many exam∣ples may make vs a shamed of oure folys∣shenesse and hardynesse. Yf we shulde thin∣ke that the lyghtest good and euyll shulde chaunce vnto vs without the singular pro¦uisyon of God. Saynt Petre sayeth. Cast all youre care to hym for he careth for you And the Psalme, Cast all thy care vpon the Lorde and he shall nourisshe the. And S. Augustyne in his cōfessyons to his soule / why stōdest thou vppon thy selfe and doest not stōde? Cast thy selfe to hym / he wil not plucke awey his hond that thou maist fal¦le. And ageyn S. Petre sayeth. Let theym that suffer accordyng to the will of God / commytte theyre soules to hym with well doyng / as vnto a faythfull creator. O yf any man dyd knowe his god after this maner / howe suer / howe quyet / howe mery shulde he lyue? be truely shulde haue
God / knowyng surely that whatsoeuer thing do come or chaunce vnto hym / it is by the dysposicyon and ordinaunce of his swete wyll. The sentence of Petre is sure and stable / he caryth for you / whate can we heare swetter thē these wordes? Ther¦fore cast all youre care (he sayeth) to hym / whiche yf we do not (but wyll oure self ca¦re for oure selfe) whate do we els then goo about to let the prouisyon of God? and to make also oure lyfe sadde / labourouse / be∣red with many feares / cares / and troubles and that in vayne / for we do nothyng pro∣fit here with / but as the Ecclesiastique sa∣yeth. This is the vanyte of all vanytyes / & veryng of the sprete / For thorow his hole boke he speakith in experyence of this thīg whiche he hath moche laboured and attēp¦ted for hym selfe. Howe be it in all his la∣boure he founde nothyng but payne vany∣te and vexacyon of the sprete / so that he cō¦cludeth that is the gyfte of God yf a man eate / drynke / and be mery with his wyfe / that is to say yf he lyue without care and thought / and so be taketh hym selfe to god whiche caryth for all. Wherfore we ought to take none other care vpon vs but this
that we take no thought for oure selfe but cōmytte and leue all oure care & thought to God. All there thinges (as I sayed) a mā may sone gather by the cōtrary ymage / and by remembraunce of his lyfe passed. ¶The fourth Chaptre of the .iiij. yma∣ge whiche is the good beneth vs. HEtherto we haue cōsydered the goo∣des whiche are in vs and oures / here after let vs exteme these goodes which a∣re set, without vs and in other. And first theym whiche are byneth vs / that is to say deade and dampned. Paraduēture ye wol¦de merueyle whate good thinges coude be founde in theym whiche are deade & damp¦ned / howe be it the power of the godly go∣odnesse is so greate in euery place that he she with vs goodnesse and his glory in the most euilles that be. Let vs cōpare theym vnto oure selfe then so we oure inestima∣ble and infinite profites / and cōmodytyes as we may also easily perceyue by the con∣trary ymage of euylles. For the moo euyl∣les of death and hell we see in theym the moo profite we perceyue in vs. And the more vehement and extreme theyr euylles be the more we count oure aduauntage
whiche are not lyghtly to be dispysed and set at nought for they commend to vs the hyghe and bounteous mercy of God. And the ieoperdye is / lest we vnking (settyng ly¦tell by it) be founde worthy to be damp∣ned with theym or worse to be tormented. Therfore the more we se theym sorowe and lament / the more we ought to reioyse in oure selfe of the goodnesse of God / ac∣cordyng to the sayng of Esay. Behold my seruauntes shall eate and you shall be hun¦gry. Beholde my seruauntes shall drynke / and you shalbe tristye. Beholde my serua∣untes shall be mery and you shall be con∣founded. Beholde my seruaūtes shall pray¦se for the reioysyng of theyre hartes / and you shall crye for the sorowe of youre har¦tes: and you shall howle for the contrici∣on of your sprete / and you shall put dow∣ne youre name in an other to my elect and so furth / fynally as I sayde. The examples of theym that do euyll dye and are damp∣ned / as saynt Gregory doth shewe in a dia¦loge / do profyt vs to be a monysshement / and an instructyon that he may be hap∣pye whome other mennes perylles do ma∣ke wise.
Truly this good (bycause it is comenly knowen) doth but litel moue vs / although it ought to be numbred amōge the chyef / & is of greate reputacyon to theym that haue good iugement / syth that a great part of ho¦ly scripture where he speaketh of the wrath iugementes / and thretenynges of God per∣teyne to this place. These holsome instruc¦cyōs / the examples of wretched persones do profitably cōfirme in vs / whiche them chyefly be of power and efficacyte / yf we put on vs the mynde of theym whiche suf∣fer theym / and cōuict oure selfe in theyre stede and place / them shall they flurre vs vp and moue vs to the prayse of the good¦nesse of God / whiche hath kept vs from theym. Let vs also cōferre theym to God hym selfe / so that we may cōfyder the iusti∣ce of god in theym. Though this he harde / yet let vs go about it / for syth that god is a iust iuge / it is expedyent that his iustice be loued and praysed. And so then ought we to reioyse in God / when he distroyeth euyll men both in body and soule / for in all these thinges his hyghe and ineffable iu¦stice she wyth hym selfe. Therfore verey helle also is full of god and hyghe goodnes¦se
/ no lesse then heuen / for the iustice of god is god him selfe / and god is the hyghe good¦nesse. Wherfore as his mercy / euen so his iu¦stice and iugement / most hyghly are to belo¦ued / praysed and preached. This ment Dauid saying the ryghtuo{us} man shall be glad when he shall se auenge¦ment / he shall wasshe his hondes in the bloude of a synner. For this cause dyd the Lord forbid Samuel that he shuld no mo¦re lament Saul / saying howe lōg mornest thou for Saul / syth I haue cast hym dow∣ne that he shuld not reygne ouer Israel? As though he shuld say / doth my wyll so displease the / that thou wilt preferre a mā¦nes with before myne? fynally. This is the voyce of prayse and gladnesse thorough all the Psalter / that the Lord is iuge of wido¦wes / and father of fatherles chyldren / that he shall auenge the pore / that his enemyes shall be cōfounded the wikked shall be di∣stroyed / and many suche other. And yf that any man thorough folisshe mercy will ha∣ue pytye on that wyked bloudy nacyō and hope of infidels whiche kylled the ryght∣uous / ye the sonne of god / by & by / he shal∣be founde to reioyce in theyre iniquite / and
to allowe and fauoure those thinges whi∣che they dyd / and so to be verey worthy to perisshe with theim whose offences he wol¦de not haue punysshed. Let vs therfore hea¦re this tex. Thou oest loue theym that bate the and hatest theym that loue the. A Ioas sayde to Dauid when he dyd ouer moche lament his wyked son an homycyde Absalon .ij. of the kynges .xix. wherfore in this ymage we must reioyce in the pitye of holy men and in the iustice of God whi∣che most ryghtuously doth punisshe the pur¦suer & of pytye / to delyuer his chosen peo∣ple from theym. And so thou seyst that the∣re appereth not a lytle but a great deale of good in theym that are dede and dampned for in theym is aduenged all the iniuryes of the holy men / and thyne also yf thou be ryghtuouse emōg theyrs. Whate merueyle is it then yf (by thy present euyll) he punys∣she thyne enemye / that is to say the synne of thy body? Ye thou must reioyse in this act of the most noble iustice of God / whiche (though thou desire hym not) doth kyll and distroye thy mischeuous enemye / that is to saye / thy synne in thy selfe / whiche yf thou fauoure thou shalt be founde a frende of
synne and an enemye of iustice whiche wor¦keth in the. So that thou mayst fere lest this be also spoken to the. Thou doest loue theym that hate the / and hatest theym that loue the. Therfore euē as thou must reioy¦se with al thy hart in the iustice whiche is feerse and cruell ageynst thy synne. Euen so must thou be glad when it pursueth and punyssheth synners whiche are the enemy¦es of god and all good men. Thou seest no we that principall goodes appere sumtyme in extreme euylles / not for the euylles but for the grete goodnesse of iustice / whiche doth auenge vs, ¶ The .v. chapter of the fyft ymage whi¦che is the euyll on the lyft hond. SOme aduersaryes we haue here in this lyfe (bisides theym of who¦me we haue spoken in the Chap∣tre next before whiche are damp∣ned and made lyke vnto fyndes) whome we must consyder with an other mynde / & we shall perceyue .ij. profites that come of theym. First that they habunde with tem∣porall goodes / in so moche that the Pro∣phetes where almost moued vnto enuy by theyre goodes / as in the Psalme .lxxvij.
My fete be almost moued / my steppes be disparsed / for I haue fauoured the wyked / seyng the peace and prosperite of synners. And after / Beholde the verey synners ha∣ue obteyned the abundauntry chesse in the worlde. And in Hieremye .xii. Truly lorde thou art iust / yf I shulde dispute with the / howe be it. I wyll speke ryghtuous thyn∣ges vnto the / why doth the wey of wyked men prosper? for they are all well / whiche trangresse thy cōmaundementes and lyue wykydly. Why doth he poure so many bene¦fytes vppon theym for nothyng and leseth theym? but to cōfort vs / and shewe howe good he is to theym that are ryghteuous / as the psalme sayeth: he that is so good to euil howe moche more shall he be good to the good? reserued that he punissheth the euil with no vexacyon / and tempteth the good with many troubles / that they may kno∣welege hym to be good to theym / not one∣ly in these present goodes / but also in the se¦crete goodes whiche be to come / and may saye with the same Psalme it is good for me to cleue to the lorde / and to put my ho∣pe in god: As though he shulde saye / be it / that I suffer some thinges whiche I se they
suffer not / yet I trust that god is moche bet¦ter vnto me them vnto theym and so these visible euylles are an argumēt of inuisible goodnesse / that we shuld trust for goodes inuisible / and despise the euylles that we suffer: Euen as Chryst in the gospell / bid∣deth vs to behold the foules of the ayre / & the ly yes of the felde saying / yf god so clo¦the the grasse whiche is to day in the fylde & to morowe shall be cast into the fornace shall he not moche more do the same vnto you / o ye of lytell fayth / wherfore by con∣ferring the goodes with whiche the euyll abounde / vnto the euylles whiche we suf∣fer oure fayth is exercysed / and oure com∣fort (whiche onely is holy) is stablisshed in god so that it is necessary that all thynges worke for the best vnto theym that loue god. The secunde profit (moche more mer∣ueylous) is that all theyre euilles are good vnto vs / god so prouydeht for vs / for al∣though theyre offences be euyll occasyons vnto the weake / yet to theim that be strong they be an exercyse of vertue / an occasyon of resisting of synne / and a greate meryte. Blissed is that man whiche suffereth temp∣tacyon / for when he is proued / he shall re∣ceyue
a crowne of lyfe / where is a greater temptacion then the multitude of mysche¦vous examples? fynally for thys cause the world is called one of the enemyes of the elect people of god bycause that sayth hys entisementes / and wicked workes / he ¦reth vs vp prouoketh vs / & entysith vs frō the wey of god into his wey / As it is wry∣ten in Gen .vi. The children of god dyd se the doughters of mē that they were fayre / and they were made carnall. And in the .xv. of Numeri / The chyldren of Israell did fall with the doughters of the Moa¦bites / so that it is holsome that we euer be suppressed by some incommodyte / lest that we (as they that are weke) offended by the euyll occasions of the worlde shulde fall and synne. So lot is commended of S. Pe¦tre in the secunde of his secund epistell / by∣cause that he suffred moche euyl by the w¦ked examples of the sodomytes / and neuer¦thelesse contynued in his ryghtuousnesse. Necessary it is therfore that euyll occasy∣ons be gyuen / whiche shuld be the occasy∣sion that we shuld resist synne & haue vic¦tory / howe be it wo be vnto the worlde by¦cause of euyll occasions. Dyth then in the
transgressions of other god {pro}cureth for vs so greate goodes: howe moche more ought we to beleue / with al oure hart that he wil turne ouer owne offens to oure profits / though the with & fleshe iuge otherwise. Nether any lesse doth the wolde profit vs by hys other euyll whiche is called aduer∣site / for theym that he cannot, deuoure by hys entisementes / nor incorporate to hym by euyll occasions / he laboureth to dryue theym from hym by troubles and passions and to vexe and inquyet theym by paynes and punysshementes / euer entending other deceytes thorough the example of synne / or elles to auert mennes myndee by pay∣nes ād turmētes. Thys is the monstre thy mer a whose hede is flateryng / and lyke a virgyns this belye deuouryng and lyke a li¦ons and his taile full of deth and lyke a ser¦pentes / for the ende of the worlde / bothe of pleasure and tyranny is venom and deth euerlastyng. Therfore as in the synnes of the worl¦de god hath made vs to fynde profytes. Euen so (that hys persequucyons shuld not be ydell and in vayne) they are ordey∣ned to vs for the encreasing of oure goodes
in so moche / that in that they hurt vs / they are compelled to profit vs. As saynt Augu¦styne dothe saye / concernyng the lytell chyl¦dren whiche were killed of Herode / he con¦de neuer haue done so greate profit & good by hys benefytes / as he dyd by hys hate & enuye. And saint Agatha went reioysyng to the pryson as though she had gone to a dyner saying on this maner without thou make my body to be well handeled of thy turmentours / my soule can not with vic∣tory entre into Paradyse, as the corne wit¦hout he be thrust out of his huske / and be strongly beten in the barne floure shal not belayd vp in the garner. But whate nede vs to speke so moche of this / syth the hole scripture / all the wrytinges and sayinges of the fathers / and all the deades and actes of the holy men are consenting vnto thys that those thynges whyche are most noy∣som are most profytable to theym that be∣leue / so that they be well suffered. As S. Petre sayeth / who is he that will harme you yf ye folowe that whyche is good. And the Psalme .lxxxviij. hys enemy shall no∣thyng prevayle agaynst hym. And the son∣ne of iniquyte shall haue no power to hur¦te
hym / howe shall he not hurte hym syth that many tymes he kylleth hym. Cruely for in hurtyng hym he doth hym most pro∣fit. Therfore wese that we dwell in the myddes of goodnesse on euery syde / yf we be wyse / and also in the myddes of euylles. So are all thynges tempered merueylous∣ly by the hygh prouidence of the goodnesse of god. ¶The syxt Chapter of the syxte ima¦ge whiche is the good on the ryght honde. THis is the congregacion of holy mē the newe creature of god / oure fren¦des and brothers in whome we se nothing but good nothyng but comforte / yf we be¦hold theym wyth a spyrytuall yie for vnto the carnall yie many tymes it appereth all otherwise / as we haue declared in the con¦trary image of euylles. And yet these goo∣des whiche we seyn theym with oure car∣nall yie are not to be dispysed. But in these we may perceyue that we are comforted of god / for the Psalme durst not presume to condempne all theym whiche possessed rychesse in this worlde / saying / If I dyd say thus. Behold I haue reproued the ge∣neration
of thy children. If I wolde haue send that all whiche are ryche / hole and ho¦noured be euyll. I shulde haue condemp∣ned thy holy men for many of theym are o Chappostell also teacheth tymothe that he commaunde the ryche men of this worlde) that they be not proude / not to forbid they¦me to be ryche. The scripture also doth te¦stifie that Abraham Isaack and Iacob we¦re ryche. And Danyell with hys compani¦ons / were also honoured in Babylon. Besi∣des thys many kynges of Iurye were ryche The Psalme therefore consyderyng theym sayeth / If I did say thus: I haue reproued the nacyon of thy children. for (I say) god hath gyuen to his elect the abundaunce of these rychesse to comfort theym / and other with all howe beit these are not theyre spe¦cyall goodes / but they are a sygne and a sha¦dowe of the trewe goodes whiche are fe∣ith / hope / cheryte / and other graces and gyf¦tes whiche all are comune by charyte. This is the communyon of holy men in the whiche we reioyse. And who will not here reioyse / ye though he be ī great sorowes whyche doth beleue (as it is in dede) that all the goodes of ho∣ly
men are his goodes and that his euyll is also theyrs. This image is most swete and pleasaunt / whiche Chappostel to the Ga∣lathians .vi. doth descrybe / saying bere ye one an others burthen and so fulfill ye the lawe of Christ. Is it not good for vs to be here where yf one membre do suffer (as it is said vnto the Corinthians) all suffer with hym. If one mēbre be had in honoure / all membres be glad also Therfore / while I suffer / I suf∣fer not alone / for Chryst and all Chrysten suffer with me. As he sayeth hym selfe / he that toucheth you toucheth the ball of my∣ne yie. Thus / do other here my burthen / and there vertue is myne. The fayth of the congregacyon socoureth my fearfulnesse. The chastyte of other healeth the tempta∣cyon of my lust. The fastyng of other is myne aduauntage. The prayers of other taketh thought for me. And to be short / so all the mēbres helpe one an other that the most honest partes do couer / kepe & honoure the lesse honest. As it is well discrybed vnto the Corinthi∣ās .xij. And a swell I may delyte in the goo¦des of other as in myne owne / and then
truely they are myne yf I be gladde and re¦ioyse in theym. I am foule and fylthy / but they whome I loue and in whome I reioy¦se are faire and beutifull. By the whiche lo¦ue I do not onely make theyre goodes my∣ne / but also theym selues / wherfore vnder theyre glory myne ignominie shall easylie honoured theyre rychesse shall fulfyll my pouertye. Theyre good dedes shall heale my synnes / whate man can nowe dispeyre in synne? who will not reioyse in paynes? whiche nowe doth not beare his synnes or at the lest yf he beare theym / he beareth theyme not alone / but is holpe with so ma¦ny children of god / ye with Chryst hym self Suche a thyng is the communyon of holy men / and the Churche of Chryst. If eny mā do not beleue that this is true he is an in∣fidele / and hath denyed Chryst & his chur∣che: for though thys be not fealt / yet it is so done / ye who is he that fealeth not thys who is in the cause that thou disperyest not that thou art not ympacyent? Thy vertue na truely / but the feloushyppe of holy mē or elles thou were not abyll to bere the lest synne that is / nor yet abyde one worde of man agaynst the / so nygh is Chryst and
the churche vnto the. This is it that we say / I beleue in the holy goost / the holy and pure churche wha¦te is it to beleue the holy churche / but the communyon of holy? wheryn do the holy men comyn? Truely in good and euyll and all thynges. As the sacrament of Chrystes body doth figure it in brede and wine whe¦rof Thappostle spekith saying / we are one brede and one body / who offendeth any ly∣tell part of the body / and hurteth not the hole? whate suffereth the ferthest part of the fote that the hole bodi suffereth not? wa¦te benefyte is done to the feate in the why∣che all the body reioyseth not. But we are one body: therfore whate so euer another sufferyth I suffer & whate so euer benefyte is done to an other / it is done to me. Euyn so Chryst sayeth that whate so euer is do∣ne to one of his left is done vnto hym wha¦te man takyng a lytell peace of breade of the altare wyll not sey that he hath taken brede / or dyspysing any lytell part of hy shall not be named to dyspyse brede. Wherfore yf we sorowe / yf we suffer / yf we dye / let oure yie loke hytherward / and let vs beleue strongly and besure / that not we
or at the lest not we alone: But christ also and his churche doth sorowe / suffer / ād dye with vs. So good is Chryst vnto vs that he wolde not the waye of oure deth shuld be solytarye whiche euery man doth abhor¦re: But (all the churche beryng vs compa∣nye) we entre the wey of passions and deth and the churche doth mare strongly suffer it then we do / so that we may well applye vnto vs the wordes of Helyseus whyche he spake to his forefull seruaunt saying: fe¦are not / there are more with vs then with theyme. And when Helyseus had prayed he sayed Lorde open this childes yies that he may se. And the Lord opened hys yies / and he dyd se / and behelde a mountaynefull of horses and charettes of fyre about Helyse∣us we lacke nowe nothyng but to pray / that oure yies may be opened and that we may fethe churche rounde about vs wyth the yies of the faith. Then haue we noting to feare. As the Psalme sayeth: Mountay∣nes are about it and the Lord in the com∣passe of his people from thys tyme present and perpetually / Amen. ¶The seuenth Chapeter of the seuenth
ymage which is the good aboue vs. I Speake nothyng of the euerlastyng and heuynly goodes whiche the blys∣sed haue in the clere syght of god. Or at the lest yf I touche theyme / it is in the fayth / by the meanes wherof we may onely obtei¦ne theyme. But this seuenth ymage is Ie∣sus Chryst kyng of glorye / rysing frō deth euin as he was the seuenth ymage of euyl∣les / sufferyng / dying / and beyng buryed / he¦re may we se the hyghe and chief ioy of ou∣re hart / and goodes parmanent and stable Here is none euylles at all / for Crist ones reysed from deth / dyeth no more / deth hath no more power ouer hym. This is the chemney of charyte / the fi∣re of god in Syon. As Esay as sayeth cryst is borne for vs / and not that onely but al¦so gyuen vnto vs. Wherfore his resurrecti¦on is myne / ye and all thynges whyche he wrought thorough his resurreccion. And as tappostell vnto the Romayns .viij. most copyously gloryeth sayng howe shall he not wyth hym gyue vs all thynges? whate wrought he by hys resurrectyon truely he dystroyed synne and raysed ryghtuousnesse confirmed deth and restored lyfe / ouercame
hell and brought euerlastyng glorye. The¦se thinges are inestimable and suche as mā¦nes vnderstonding scarce can beleue to be gyuen vnto hym: No more then Iacob whyche (amased euē as though he had wa¦kened out of a grete slepe when he herd sey that his sonne Ioseph dyd reygne ī Egipt) coude not beleue it vntyll they rehersyng all did shewe hym the waynes that were sent from Ioseph. So truely it had byn ve∣ry harde to beleue that suche greate bene∣fytes had byn by Iesu Chryst geuen to vs whiche were vnworthye except that bi ma¦ny wordes / by many wayes and apperin∣ges he had shewed hym selfe to hys dyscy∣ples. So that at the last by great vse and expe∣ryence of hys shewyng and teachyng (as Iacob was by the waynes we be taught so to beleue. Truely Chryst is to vs a true and notable sygne / and wayne whyche is made of god / oure wisdome / ryghtuousnes∣se / sanctifyeng and redempcion. As thap∣postell sayeth I am a snne / but I am cary∣ed in his rightuousnesse whiche is gyuen vnto me. I am vnclene but hys holynesse is my sanctifieng / wheryn I am swetely ca∣ryed
/ I am folisshe / but hys wysdome cary¦eth me / I am synfull and dampnabyll but hys innocency is my redempcion hys good¦nesse is a sure charyot that caryeth me out of perdycion. Thus may euery Chrysten / this stōding that he haue feith) bost of all the goodnesse & merites of Christ: nether ne¦deth he more nor lesse to reioyse in theym then yf he had done theym hym self / and e∣uen so are they hys owne. So that nowe he may ioyfully abyde the iugement of god whyche eyles were intollerable. Suche a noble thyng is faith. Suche profites is get¦teh for vs. Suche glorious children of god it maketh vs. Nether can we be chylder except we enheryte oure fathers goodes. Let then euery Cristen sey with sure trust and confydence: deth / where is thy victory deth / where is thy stynge / that is to sey syn¦ne? for the styng of deth is synne / ād the po¦wer of synne is the lawe. Thankes be to god whyche hath gyuen vs the victory / tho¦rough Iesu Chryst oure Lorde / fynally. The lawe maketh vs synners / And synne maketh vs subiect vnto the sentēce of deth who hath ouercome these .ij. oure iustyce? oure lyfe? nay truely / but Iesus Chryst rys¦sing
from deth ondempnyng synne & deth gyuyng vs his rustyce / and distributing to vs hys merytes / whyche also by puttyng hys bond vpon vs hath healed vs and ge∣uen vs power to fulfyll the lawe to ouer∣come deth / to exile synne and to bothe chyl∣dren of god / to whome be honoure / pray∣se / and thankes wyth out measure / and en¦de. Ammen. Thys is the last ymage in the whyche nowe we (not onely lylt vp aboue oure e∣uylles / but also aboue oure goodes lately also sittyng in the euylles and perylles to vs purchased by the synne ād offence of an other / and encreased by oure owne) nowe fitte and rest vs in the goodes gotten by the rightuousnesse of an other that is of Ie¦sus cryst onely for vs crucfied we are iusti∣fied in his iustice and euen as he is iust & ryghtuous / euen so are we that are alyed knytte / and clene vnto hym by fayth This is he that hath gyuen hym self hole to vs. This is he that pleaseth god. Thys is the most chyef prest / the true bysshop / the good aduocate oure onely mediator / that con∣tinually (neuer ceassing) in the presence of hys father prayeth for vs. And loke howe
impossible it is that he in his iustice shuld not please Euen so impossible it is that we by fayth wherby we cleue vnto his ryghtu¦ousnesse shulde not please. And bi these me¦anes a Chrysten is almyghty / Lord of all thynges / ād clene without all synne. And yf it chaunce that he falle ynto synne? yet is it necessary that they hurt not / but are forgeuen for the iustyce of Christ whyche is not a bill to be ouercome whyche dryeth vp and putteth awey all synne / on the whi¦che also oure fayth doth lene surely bele∣uyng that Christ is suche a one vnto vs as we haue spoken of hym / and moche better then we are able to declare / for he that be∣leueth not this / knowith not Christ nether vnderstondeth whate Chryst proufiteth / neither whate he is good for. Wherfore euen this one ymage yf there were none other / may encrease suche com∣fort in vs yf we behold it with a good ād dylygēt hert that we shall nothing be sory in oure troubles but rather (as though we felt theym not) reioyse & be glade in Chryst that we haue tribulacions with the whi∣che reioysing instruct vs chryst hī self oure Lordes god whiche is blissed for euer. And
¶A deuoute frutefull and godlye remem∣braunce of the passion of oure sauioure Christ Iesu. THere are certeyne which when they exercyse thē selues in the meditacion or remembraunce of the passyon which Christ suf¦fered for man kynde / do nothynge elles but were wode and furious agenst the blinde Iues and Iudas theyr gyde thorow whom he was betrayed (as an innocent lambe) in¦to theyr bloudye and cruell handes (Euen as it is the comen maner of them whych a¦re wonte to lament and bewayle the myse¦ye of theyr frendes to accuse and crye out on those persones whych do the deade) but they nothynge consider them which a∣re the chefe causes of his better deeth and passion. So that surely thys maye better be called a remembraūce of the Iues wyc∣kednes then of Chrystes passion. There are other that haue gathered to gether diuerse cōmodityes which spryn¦ge thorow the diligent beholdynge of thys
passyon / wherof is the sayenge of Albert in euerye mās mouth: that it is better to re∣membre the passyon of Christ once in oure lyfe all though it be but slenderlye / the to fast euerye daye a hole yere to gether: or to reade ouer the hole psalter of Dauid / how he it for all theire politike meanes and stu∣dyouse ymaginacyōs they coude neuer at∣tayne the verye vse and profyte of the pas∣syō of Christ. Nether sought they any thyn¦ge theryn but their awne priuate welth / For some caryed aboute thē ymages / payn¦ted papers / carued tables / crosses and soch other trifles / yee & some felle to soch mad∣de ignoraunce that they thought them sel∣ues thorow soch beggerrye to be safe frō fyre / water and all other perylous ieoper∣dyes. As though the crosse of Christ shuld delyuer them frō soch outward troubles and not rather the cōtrarye. These doo pytuouslye sorowe and mor∣ne for Christ and cōplayne that he was in¦nocent and gylties put to deeth / euen lyke as the wemen of Hierusalem whom Christ hym self dyd reprehende aduertisynge them that they shuld lament them selues & theyr awne children. Nether is it anye meruell
for the preachers them selues are sycke of the same disease / which for the most parte when they encrease this mater / lepe out of the frutefull and holesom storye in to the¦se theyr comen places: how Iesus toke his leaue of his disciples I Bethania. And with what dolorous syghes his mother Marye pityed hym and soth other thinges / on se these that table at length and discant at these plesures rather to the wereynge then edefyenge of the audience / vnto this sorte maye we also adnumbre them which haue defyned and enstructe other what excellēt commodytyes are in the masse / in so moch that the rude & ignoraunte people persua∣ded thē selues that it was sufficient yf they had herde a masse / and that they shuld ha∣ue good lucke what so euer mischefe they went a boute. And there are some which runne so farre hedlinge that they affirme stoutelye that the masse which they call a sacrifice is accepte of god for the worke it selfe & not for his sake that doeth the masse They consider not that god loketh first on the person that worketh / and then after on the worke as thou hast a goodlye ensam¦ple Geue, the fourth of Abell and Cayn.
They consyder not that an euell tre can not brynge forth good frute. Matth. xil. And that on a bromble men can gether no fygges. Matth. vij. They consider not that the masse was institute of Christ to make vs more holye thorow the deuoure remembraunce of his passyon with a pure fayth / and not for any other worthynesse that it hath in it self. How be it though we shuld graunte them that the masse in it self were as good and holye as their couetous∣nes and belyes haue fayned it / yet trulye can it nothinge profyte vs excepte we vse it for the same purposse that Christ dyd in∣stitute it. For what doth it profitte vs that meate and drincke are good and holesom yf we abuse them corruptinge oure natu∣re / yee or what doth it auayle vs that god is God / that is to saye almightye / most mer¦cyfull / good righte wille and alone sufficiēt yf we abuse his goodnes and beleue not in him? It is therfore to be feared lest yf thou be ignoraunte in the true vse of the masse that the moo thou hearest the more thou offendest god abusinge his institucyon and ordinaunce. ¶But these are the verye ryght behol¦ders
of Christes passyon / which cōsyder & marcke in his passyon their awne synnes & enormityes which were the cause & groun¦de of his passyon and deeth / for they are fea¦red / and their cōsciences tremble as sone as they remembre the passyō which feare and tremblynge ryeseth of this that they maye se in the passyon the vehement wrath and ryghtuous punyshement of god the father ageynst synners which wold not for al the abundaunt fauoure that he had vnto his ōne suffer malefactoures to go fre & vnpu∣nyshed but that he must redeme them with his awne deeth / which thinge Esayas .liij. doth also cōfirme sayenge in the person of god the father: for the synnes of my people haue I wounded hī. What then shall be co¦me of vs / syth his most deare and onlye son¦ne is so cruellye entreated? It must nedes be a meruelous and inenartable wrath to¦wardes vs which coude not be pacefyed but thorow the deeth / yee and that thorow the deeth of Christ his best beloued sonne And verelye yf a man do marke diligentlie that the verye sonne of God / the ymage and wysdō of the father did suffer for oure trās¦gressyons / to recōcyle vs vnto his father /
there is no doute but he shall tremble and abhorre his greuous iniquityes. Further more emprent this thinge sure∣lye & graue it in thy harte thou thy selfe / art one of them which on this maner doest tor¦ment and crucefye Christ. For thy synnes haue cast hym in to those tormentes accor¦dinge to the wordes of Peter Actes .ij. whe¦re he amased the Iues as with a thonder clappe sayenge vnto al that where present you haue crucyfyed hym. At which voyce thre thousande men were astoyned & sayed vnto the Apostles. What shall we now do brethren: therfore when thou seyst the nay¦les fastened in the handes of Christ / thyn∣ke that those sharpe nayles are thy euyll deades. When thou beholdest his brayne perced with the ceoune of thornes / thinke that those thornes are thy wycked though¦tes and setle ymaginacyons. And where thou seyst Christ pricked with one thorne / remēbre that thou hast deserued to be pric¦ked a thousand folde moare of the and gre∣uouslye. Where thou seyst his handes and fete thrust thorow with nayles / remembre that thou hast deserued with out cōparison moare cruell payne. And surelye they that
despise the passyon of Christ / shal without ende suffre most greuous tormentes. For the vehement wrath and rightuouse punis∣hement of god (which he well declared in that he wold his onlye sonne to dye for ou¦re transgressions) is no ioyned trifle / but the wyked and vnfaithfull shall proue it in deade. This sorow and tremblinge founde sa∣ynte Barnarde out of Christes passyon / sayinge in the thirde sermone of the birthe of oure lorde. Brethren / the teares of christ do engender in me both shame and sorow¦weth feare. I was playenge with out in chastyante / and in the kinges secrete chaum¦bre there passed ageynst me a sentence of dth. The kinges eare and onlye sonne harde of this and went forthe (layenge a sy¦de his costlye oches and precious diade∣mes) and clothed hym self in sacke cloth sprink kynge asshes on his hed / goynge ba∣efte / wepinge and sobbinge that his ser∣uaunte was condemned vnto death. I be∣hold hym as he hasted out & wondred what now thinge that might be: I enquired the cause & he shewed it me. What shal I now doe? shall I playe stille & nothinge regar∣de
his teares? Trulye excepte I be mad or out of my witte I ought to folow hym / a morne with hym fith he moorneth for me / Behold the cause of shame / frō whence sprī¦geth the sorow and feare verelye when I considre the medecyne and remedye / then of that maye I esteme the quātitye & depth of my synne. I was clene ignoraunt and thought myself hole & beholde the tender chyld of a virgyn & sonne of God almygh∣tye was delyuered into the handes of the vngodlye & cōmaunded to be stayne / that he myght cure with the precyouse baume of his bloude my festred wondes & corrupte nature / we must nedes knowleges grauit∣te that those were greuouse woundes / for the which oure Lorde Christ must suffer and be wounded: yf they had not bene to deeth / yee and that euerlastinge / the sonne of God shuld neuer haue suffered to haue healed them. &c. Euen to dyd Christ monis∣he the wemen of Hierusalem: wepe not for me / but for youre awne selues and chylder He added a cause / for (quod he) yf this be done in moyst wodde / What shalbe do∣ne in drye / as though he shuld saye yf this be done in me which an pure & innocen /
what shall be done in you which are hoel∣lye corrupt and vicyatte? ye maye lerne by this my passyon what ye haue deserued which payne (except ye beleue) ye can not escape / here to maye we well applye the pro¦uerbe: men smyte the whelpe to feare the greate bā dogge: christ was smytē innocēt to geue vs warnynge of oure outragyous vices & enormityes. To this well agreeth the Prophete which sayeth that all the na¦cyōs of the erth shall bewayle them selues vpon hym. He sayeth not that they shall be¦wayle hym / but that they shall bewayle them selues vpon hym. Euen so were they dismayed Actes .ij. as is before rehersed. And the church syngeth: I shall surelye re¦membre it & my soule shal melt with in me And in this sorowfull bewaylinge of them selues ought the faythfull diligentlie to exercyse them selues / for on this hāgeth the hole profyte and vse of Christes passi∣on / that a man maye knowe him selfe / that he myght tremble and repent in beholdin∣ge his greuous enormytes / for trulye excep¦te he come to this poynte / the passyon of Christ doth nothinge awayle hym. This is the pure and perfecte operacyon that the
passyō of Christ worketh with in vs / that we maye be made lyke vnto hym that as Christ was greuouslye vexed both in bo∣dye and soule for oure synnes / euen so that oure cōscience maye scourge and torment vs for oure awne wykednesses which are so many and so greate that they are sone called to memorye excepte we wylbe wyl fullye blynde & not se that which is most present & familyar with vs. Let vs vse an ensample to make the thinge more euydent Be it in case that a certayne kynges sonne were slayne. And the murther ar taken and brought to the sessyōs and accused before the iudge of this capitall cryme / which cō¦fesseth openlye that he hath done the dead / addinge that he dyd it at thy requeste and thou wast the chefe auctor & setter a wor∣ke. Yf thou in the meane ceason were takin¦ge thy pastyme and recreacyon / and soden∣lye were arested and cast in pryson as ac∣cessorye of this murther yee or rather as principall the other beynge but thy myny∣ster and instrument of thy meschefe / wold not euen shortlye thy myrth abate / the co∣loure apale / thy flesshe faynte and tremble Now yf thy cōscience dyd also accuse the &
iustefy ageynst the that thou were iustlye npresned / what raging hell & vnquiet∣nesse shuldest thou then feale with in thy ha. Euen so  not he more shall he be altered which do dyd remembreth the pas∣syon of Christ. For the Iude (although ex¦ecutyon be done on  as malefactours and they abiecte f the face of god) yet we¦re they but the ministres of thy synne / For in verye dead thy synnes nayled him to the crosse and were the hole cause of his payne and doeth / as we haue shewed before. Now yf there be anye so harde and in∣sense e that they can nother tremble no∣ther yet begynne to knowe them selues in the remēbraunce of this bitter passion they stōde surelye in shrode case. For it is necessa¦rye that we be made conformable vnto the sonne of god / that is to saye / that we feale the depth and burthen of synne other in this worlde or in tyme to come / yee and that wee quake / tremble and taste of the deadlye panges which Christ suffered on the crosse. But surelye it is a miserable and pytuous thinge to begynne then to feale them / when we are in the extremite and poynts of deeth. Therfore let euerye man
praye vnto God that he wold vouchsaffe to geue vs his sprete & grace / which maye mollifye oure indurate hartes that we ma¦ye with some frute call vnto remembraun∣ce the passyon of Christ / for I thinke no man is so mad to suppose that we of oure awne power with out the sprete of God can do other this or any other thinge ac∣ceptable to God / for al goodnesse is of god and not of vs. Nether do we teach the this or anye other thinge to thentent that thou shuldest thynke that thou were able to accomplish it of thyne awne power / but onlye to mo∣nyshe the of thy duetye that when thou fea¦lest thyne awne imbecyllite thou mayst de∣syre this grace of God / and thorow his hel¦pe fulfyll that which is required of the. For the cause why those men a fore sayde dyd vnprofytablye handle this passiō / was this: they sturke hoellye vnto their awne power & natural imaginaciōs nether ones desired the grace of god / & so coude they at∣tayne to no profyte. But he that remem∣breth the passiō of Christ on this maner as we haue shewed (all though it be but one houres space) maye well haue the sayenge
of Albarte verefyed vpon hym that he hath bene better occupyed / then yf he had fasted euerye daye a hole yere to gether or els had red ouer the hole Psalter of Dauid / yee & I dare boldlye adde that he hath better be∣stowed his tyme then yf he had harde a hū¦dreth massee / for this goolye remem∣braunce doth euen renue a man and doth testifye vnto his cōscience that he is rege∣nerate and borne ageyne / euen in a maner as wel as baptyme. So that this is the pu¦re and naturall worke of Christes passion to mortifye the old man of synne that ray∣neth / in oure membres to caste out all ho∣pe and cōforte that we haue in creatures / & so depe to brynge a man in to the know∣lege of his synne that he shall come euen to the brincke of desperacyon and thinke that he is forsaken of god. Yet it leaueth hī not there but it brīgeth hym agayne with all cōsolacyon and cōforte & sheweth hym that al his outragyous enormityes are cru¦cifyed with Christ and thorow his deeth put out of the waye that they can neuer ac¦cuse hym more / and that the fathers wrath is pacefyed by his sonnes deeth / and we al (as manye as beleue that Christes deeth
hath payed the raunsome of oure synne) are set at one with god and are become his chil¦der so that he is no more oure iudge which shuld punishe vs for oure inquityes / but wyll he called oure mercyful father which forgeueth his childrens transgressyons. Now syth we can not thus frutefullye remembre Christes passyon excepte we be enspired with grace from aboue (for oure impotent & viciate nature can do no good without the sprete of god) the next reme∣dye to obteyne this frutefull gyftes is to praye and desyre it of god oure father / and all be it he geue it vs not in the same tyme and moment that we wold haue it / yet let vs not despayre and cease from prayer par¦aduenture he holdeth it from the to make the more desyrous of it and to sette the mo∣re by it when it cometh / and that thou maist knowe that it is not in thy power and wil to haue it at thy pleasure / but this is a cle¦re case that he wyl surelye geue it the whē it shall be most expedyent for his glorye & thy welth / which tyme no man knoweth but he alone. Therfore let vs prescribe hī no tyme / but euer submytte oure wlles to his and praye that his wyll be fulfylled
And contrarye wise sumtyme he geueth vs this gyfte before we praye or axe it / nether gueth he vs a al tymes the sprete to pra∣ye / but distributeth that gyfte also / euē a his awne godlye pleasure nether wyll he that it be bounde other to tyme place or any person. When he hath ones receaued the sprete which mollesyeth the harre and bryngeth hym in to the remembraunce of the passyon / fly and by his harte tremblet he lotheth hym selfe and knowlegeth his in¦firmitye / so that the effecte of the passyon is fulfylled in hym in a maner before he be a¦ware. But they that falle to their medita∣cyons and behold this passyō beynge voyd of this sprete which openeth the harte / ta∣ke greate laboures and are diligentlye oc∣cupied but all aboute nought: for they can not her repent not yet perceaue their awne infirmitye / which is the verye ende and ef∣fect of Christes passyon. So mayst thou se that the first with our laboure attayne the frute and profyte of Christes passyon all though it appeare not outwardlye. And the other for all their diligent studye haue nothynge profyted / although they seme out¦wardlye to haue God by the fote. And
thus doth God turne topse turne a / that they which are all daye occupyed in hea∣ringe masses and in remembringe Christes passyon get none auantage / and the other which seme to do none of both / do both in deade and obtayne the hole profyte. Hetherto haue we entreated the crosse and passyon of Christ by the remembraun∣ce wherof we knowe oure infirmityes / ab¦horre oure vices and are clene ouerthrow¦ne readye to falle in to the pitte of despera¦cyon / and now will we touch how oure cōsciences thus wounded and cast doune must be lyfte vppe agayne. ¶When a man begynneth on this ma¦ner to knowe and feale his synnes & trem∣bleth at the hydeous syght of them / let him take good hede that those tremblinge mo∣cyons sticke not to longe in his cōscience for so shuld he falle in to vtter desperacyō But euen as that feare & knowlege of syn∣ne dyd springe out of Christes passyon / so must oure conscience vnlade her selfe agay¦ne and laye all on Christes backe. But be∣ware that thou do not as the vnfaithfull doo / for they when they feale their synne / that their cōscience biteth thē / they runne
to their awne good workes / to satisfactiōs pilgrimages and pardōs / and so vexe theyr meruelouslye their vnquiet myndes to rid them frō theyr burden / but their laboure is in vayne. And yet hath that false cōfidence & trust in satisfactiōs so spred it selfe / that it hath founded manye religious cloystres in christendom / to the vtter destruccyō of all christianite for yf I can make satisfactiō for my synnes / the is christes bloude shed in vayne. Therfore on this maner shalt thou vnlade thy mynde and cast thy synnes on Christ. First thou must faithfullye be∣leue / that Christ suffered for thy sake euen to redeme thy synnes / and that he toke thē on his awne backe and made full satisfac∣cyō for thē vnto his father / as Esa. sayeth liij. the lorde layed on hym all oure iniqui¦tyes & .i. Pet. ij. he bare oure synnes in his awne bodye vpon the crosse. And Paule .ij Corin. v. God made him that knewe no sin¦ne / synne for vs (that is to saye a sacrifice for oure synne) that we thorow him might be that ryghtuousnes which before god is alowed. Now the more that thy cōscience boyleth & ryseth ageynst the / the more shalt thou cleaue to these and soch other cōfor∣table
sentences / and put thy hole fyaunce in Christ an they teach the / for yf thou god aboute thorow thy contricyon / and satis∣faccyon to pacefye and aswage thy ragyn∣ge conscience / thou shalt neuer be in sure∣tye / but after intollerable laboure and toy¦linge thou shalt falle in to vtter desperaci¦on / for the conscience can not be quyet whē he fealeth his synne / but estemeth is grea∣ter thē that we of oure awne power shuld be able to qwench it. Not with stondinge yf he sawe that Chryst which is both god and man had taken them vppon hym and had vaynquesshed them by his deth / yee ād¦tyesinge agayne had triumphed vpon deth hell and the deuell: then shuld he sone per∣ceaue how weake the stinge and power of synne is / for euen as the paynes of his wo¦undes and panges of hys deth do now no more remayne in his bodye: euen so are all oure synnes vanysshed awaye like smoke to this well agreeth the sayinge of Paule Rom .iiij. that Christ dyed for oure synnes and is rysen agayne to iustifie vs. That is the passyon / and deth of Chryst doth open / and declare oure synnes vnto vs and so doth take them awaye / but tho∣row
hys rysinge agayne are we iustefyed and made fre from all oure synnes / yf we beleue. How be it yf we feale oure vnbelefe that we can not be surelye persuaded that the∣se thinges are true / them is the next reme∣dye to falle vnto prayer for this also is in the hand of god nether is it geuē to euerie man but some haue it more & some lesse for god distributeth all at his pleasure. Not withstondinge there are certayne meanes and smale pathes by the which a mā maye haue as it were an entraunce in to this fa¦ith / fyrst turne thine eyes and beholde the hartye loue & bounteous kindnes of chryst which so tenderlye loued the that he wold take on him self all thy synnes / & louynglye enbrace the to hele thy wounded conscien¦ce / yf thou remembre and thinke on thys a¦mitye thy harte shall somwhate be refres∣hed and so shall thy trust in Chryst be the more encreased and stablysshed. After that thou hast perceaued this fer∣uent fauoure that Christ had to wardes the then shalt thou sone marcke what good will the father owed the / for then shall it appeare that Chryst coude not endue the
with such greate benefytes excepte it had bene before so decreed of hys heuenlye fa∣ther / for vnto him did Chryst obey whē he suffered for thy trāsgressions. And so shalt thou se the flamynge cheryte of god the fa∣ther towardes the / and thorow crist shalt thou be so drawne to the father that thou mayst perceaue the sayinge of Chryst. Ioā. iij. God so loued the worlde that he gaue his ōlye sonne for thē tent that none which beleue in hym shuld perysh but shuld haue euerlastynge lyfe. And thys is the true knowlege of god when we beholde / and magnefye not hys puysaunt mageste or his incomprehensible prudence (for they make a man a frayde of God) but rather his cur¦teous and mercyefull beneuolence wher¦in he maye put hys confydence / and maye be hoellye in god renued. ☞ And when thy harte is so confer¦med in Chryst that thou begynnest wyth full entent to hate thy synne not for fe∣are of payne but for the loue that thou hast vnto god because thou woldest not dis¦please hym whych is soch a mercyfull and louinge father vnto the: then is it expediēt that thou take thys passyon for an ensam∣ple
by the which thou maist ordre thy lyfe but this remembraunce is farre vnlike the first / for hetherto haue we recounted it as a secrete mysterye whych shuld worke in vs and renue vs thorow repentaūce / and whē we haue obtayned that profyte then let vs considre it as an ensample or rule to order oure lyffe and workes / euer compa∣ringe them vnto Christes passion on thys maner as foloweth. When thou art dyseased with anye so∣row or maladye: then thynke how smalle that payne is yf thou shuldest comparte it with Christes croune of thorne ād the nay¦les which perced his tendre flesh. When thou art constrayned to doo or le∣aue vndone anye thinge which thou wol∣dest not: then remembre that Chryst was bounde and tossed from post to piller euen as it pleased his cruell enemyes. Yf thou be tempted with pryde & lordly¦nesse: then marke how vnworthelye Crist was mocked / yee and crucyfyed betwene two theues / that he myght be reputed as one of theyr nombre. Yf thou be assayled with wantonnesse or with the lust of the flesh: then behold how
cruellye the tendre flesh of Crist was sco∣urged torne and most pituouslye woūded. Yf thy harte boyle with hate or enuye & be full sette to take auengeaunce: then cal∣le to thy remembraunce how Crist with a lamētable voyce did praye vnto hys father for the / and other his enemyes / whom he myght bi good right haue punisshed perpe∣tuallye. Yf thou be vexed with anye other afflic¦tions whate so euer they are / whether se∣crete or open / take them on good worth & be not disquieted / but thynke with thy sel∣fe on this maner. It were a great shame yf I shuld not suffre paciētlye this smal trou¦ble / syth that Christ my Lorde and sauyou∣re suffered in the garden such panges that he swette droppes of bloude / for whate is more shame then that the seruaunte shuld take his ease and lye sluggeshlye in his bed what tyme his master stondeth in ieoper∣dye of his lyfe. Behold / on this maner mayst thou cō¦forte and stablish thy harte with the passi∣on of christ agenst all vexacyons. And this is the true meditacyon and remembraun∣ce of Chrystes passyon out of whych the a
fore sayde commodityes sprynge. Therfore they that exercyse them selues di¦lygentlye in it / are moch better occupyed then yf they harde a thousande tymes the storie of the passion / or sayet as manye mas¦ses. And these onlye are the true Chrysten which on this wyse do expresse in theyr ly¦fe or manners the name and lyfe of Chryst as Saynte Paule sayeth: they that belon∣ge to chryst haue crucefyed theyr flesh and concupiscentes with Christ. Nether it is ynough that we countre fa¦yte him in oure outwarde be haue oure ād wordes / but we must do oure endeueraun¦ce perfeytlye to expresse hys passion in all oune conuersacyon from the botom of ou∣re hartes which thynge. Paule exhorteth vs vnto Hebrew .xij.. Loke vnto Iesus the captayne of oure faith / which for the ioye that was sette before hym abode the crosse and dispised the shame / & is sette dounne on the right hande of god. Consider therfore how that he endured such speakinge agēst hym of synners / lest ye shuld be weryed or faynte in oure myndes. And saynte Petre .i. Pet .iiij. sayeth for as moch as cryst hath suffered in the flesh / arme youre selues ly∣kewyse
wyth the same mynde. How be it the maner of thys remembraunce is verye rare & out of vse although Saint Paule & Saint Petre make eftsones mention of it. And we haue chaunged it al to gether into an outwarde apperaūce and haue thought it sufficient to behold the story of the passy∣on paynted vpon walles. But there are verye fewe (yee almost none) that call it to theyr remēbraunce for thent to know the∣yr synnes by it / or to quyet theyr tremblyn¦ge consciences / or to ordre and cōpare the∣ir liffe to this ensample. ¶ Thus endeth the meditacyon and fru∣tefull remembraunce of Chrystes passyon which passeth the contemplacyon of Monkes / fryers and Nonnes yee and all other reli¦gious, ¶ We purpossed (Christen brother) to ha∣ue annexed the Christian Libertye / how be it all thinges cōsidered we thought it most profitable for this present world to ioyne rather vnto the ende of this boke a deuoute exposicyon vppon the Psalme Miserere mei Deus
¶An exposicyon after the maner of a contemplacyon vpon the .li. Psalme / called Misereremei Deus. ALas wretch that I am / comfort∣lesse / and forsaken of all men / which haue offended both hea∣uen / and erth / whother shall I turne me. To whom shall If lye for socou¦re? who shal haue pytye or cōpassion on me vnto heauen date I not lifte vppe myne eyts / for I haue greuouslye synned agenst it. And in the erth can I fynde no place of defence / for I haue bene noysome vnto it whate shall I nowe do? shall I despayre? God forbid full mercyfull is god / and my souyoure is meake / and louynge / therfore onlye god is my refuge he will not despise his creature nother forsake his awne yma¦ge vnto the therfore most meke and merci¦full good come I all sad and sorowfull for thou onlye arte my hope / and thou arte on lye the toure of my defēce. But whate shall I saye vnto the fyth I dare not lyfte vppe mine yies? I wyll poure out the wordes of sorow / I will hartelye besech the for mercye and wyll saye.
Haue mercye apon me (oh god) accordinge to thy grace mercye. God which dwellest in light that no man can attayne / God whych are hid and canst not be sene with bodelye yies / nor compre¦hended with any vnderstondinge that euer was made nether expressed with the tōgues of mē or angels. My god: the / whych arte incomprehēsible do I seke: the / which cāst not be expressed do I call vppon what tin¦ge so euer thou arte / which arte in euerye place. I knowe that thou arte the most hye and excellēt thinge / yf thou be a thinge and not rather the cause of all thinge / yf I maye so calle the / for I finde no name by the which I maye name or expresse thyne inenarrable magestye. God (I saye) which arte all thinges that are in the / for thou ar¦te euen thyne awne wysdom / thy power and thy most gloryouse felycyte. Seynge therfore that thou arte mercyfull / what arte thou but euen the verye mercye it sel∣fe? And what am I / but verye miserye? Be∣hold therfore o god which arte mercye / be∣hold myserye is before the / what shalt thou do mercye? truelye thy worke canst thou do
otherwise then thy nature is? And whāte is thy worke? verelye to take awaye myse∣rye / and to lifte vpp them that are in wret¦ched condicyon / therfore haue mercye on me oh god. God I saye which arte mercye take a waye my miserye / take a waye my synnes / for they are myne extreme myserye. Lift vppe me which am so miserable shew thy worke in me / and exercyse thy power apon me. One depth requyreth another / the depth of myserye requyreth the depth of mercye. The depth of synne areth the depth of grace and fauoure. Greater is the depth of mercye then the depth of myserye. Let therfore the one depth swalow vppe the other. Let the bottomlesse depth of mercye swalow vp the profounde depth of myserye. Haue mercye on me oh god accordynge to thy greate mercye. Not after the mercye of men whych is but smalle / but after thy∣ne awne mercye which is greate / which is vnmesurable / which is incomprehensible / which passeth all synnes without compa∣rison. Accordynge to that thy greate mer∣cye wyth the whych thou hast so loued the world / that thou woldest geue thyne onlye
sonne / what mercie cā be greater? what lo¦ue cā be more / who cā despayre who shuld not haue good confidence? god was made man / & crucefied for mē therfore haue mer¦cye on me oh God accordynge to this thy greate mercye bi the which thou hast geuen thy sonne for vs by whych (thorow hym) thou hast takē awaie the synne of the worl¦de: bi which (thorow his crosse) thou hast lyghtened all mē by whē (thorow hī) thou hast redressed all thinges in heauē and erth wash me (oh Lorde) in his bloude / lighten me in his humilite / redresse me in his resur¦reccion. Haue mercie on me oh God not af¦ter thy smal mercie for that is but thy smal mercie (in cōparison) whē thou helpest mē of their bodelie euylles but it is great whē thou forgeuest synnes & dost eleuate mē by thy fauoure aboue the toppe of the erth. Euē so Lord haue mercie on me accordīge to this thi greate mercie that thou turne me vnto the that thou put out my synnes and that thou iustefie me bi thi grace & fauoure. And accordinge to the mustitu¦de of thy compassiōs wype awaye myne iniquyte.
Thy mercye Lorde is the habundaūce of thy pytye / by the which thou lokest gentlye on the poore and wretched. Thy compassy¦ons are the workes ād processes of thy mer¦cye. Marye magdalene came vnto thy fete (good Iesu) she wasshed them wither tea∣res / and wyped them with her here / thou forgauest her and sentest her a waye in pe∣ace / this was (Lorde) one of thy compassi∣ons / Petre denyed the ād forsoke the with an oth / thou lokedst apon him and he wep∣te bitterlye / thou forgauest him and madest hym one of the chefe amonge thyne Apost∣les. this was (lorde) another of thy com∣passyons. The these on the crosse was sa∣ued with one worde. Paule in the furious wodnes of his persecution was called ād by and by fulfylled wyth the holye goste / these are Lorde thy compassyons. The tyme shuld faile me yf I shuld enum∣bre all thy merciable compassyons / for lo∣ke how manye ryghtwyse men there be / ād so manye are thy godlye compassions / There is none that can glorye in hym sel∣fe. Let them all come that are ryghtwy∣se other in erth or in heauen and let vs axe them before the whether they be saued by
theyr awne power and vertue. And sure∣lye all they will answere with one harte / and one mouth sayenge. Not vnto vs (Lorde) not vnto vs / but vn∣to thi name geue all the prayse / for thy mer¦cye & for thy truthes sake for they in theyr awneswerde possessed not the lande / and theyr awne arme or power saued them not but thy right hande and thyne arme ād the lighteninge of thy councenaunce for thou delitedst in the / that is / they are not saued for their awne deseruynges lest any man shuld boste him selfe / but because it pleased the so to be whych thynge the Prophete doth also more expresselye witnesse of the whē he sayeth he saued me because he wold haue me. Sith therfore that thou arth the me god wyth whome is no alteracyon or variablenesse nether art thou chaūged vn¦to darknesse: and we thy creatures as wel as oute fathers whych were borne vnder concupyscence synners as well as we and sith there is but one mediatore and a tone∣ment betwene god and man that is chryst Iesus whych endureth for euer / why dost thou not poure on thy plentuous compassi¦ons vppon vs / as well as thou didest vp∣pon
oure fathers? hast thou forgotē vs? or are we onelye synners: did not crist die for vs? Are all thy mercyes spent & none lefte. Lorde oure god I desyre & hartelye be∣sech the / to put out myne iniquite accordin¦ge vnto the multitude of thy compassions for manye yee & infinite are thy compassiōs that accordynge (I saye) to the multytude of thy cōpassions thou vouchsafe to quēch my synne: that as thouhast draune & recea∣ued innumerable synners / & hast made thē rightuous euen so that thou wilt drawe & take me & make me rightwyse thorow thy grace & fauoure / therfore accordinge to the multitude of thy compassions wype awaie myne iniquyte. Clense & purefye myne har∣te (after all myne iniquyte is put out / and all my vnclennesse clensed) it maye be as a clene table in the whych the fynger of god may wryte the lawe of his loue ād che¦ryte wyth the whych can none inyquyte contynue. Yet wash me more from myne iniquite & clense me frō my synne. I graunte and knowlege oh Lorde thou hast once put out myne iniquyte thou hast
put it out agayne / And hast wasshed me a thousande tymes / how be it yet wash me from myne inyquyte / for I am fallen a¦gayne. Dost thou vse to spare a synfull man vntyll a certayne numbre of his syn∣ne / whych when Peter enquyred / how of then shall my brother offende agenst me and I shall forgeue hym / whether seuen ty¦mes? thou answeredst: I saye not seuen ty∣mes but seuentye tymes seuen tymes takyn¦ge that certeyne numbre / for an infynyte numbre / syth then that a man must forge∣ue so often / shalt thou in pardoninge and forgeuenesse be passed of a man? is not god more then man? is he not better then man yee rather god is the greate Lorde / and e∣uerye man lyuynghe is nothynge but all vanyte. And onlie god is good and euerye man a lyar / hast thou not sayed: In what houre so euer the synner doth repent I will not re∣mēbre any of his iniquities Behold I a syn¦ner do repent and morne / for myne old pre¦uye sores festred within and now are they brokē forth for myne awne folyshnesse. I am depressed and fore broken / I walke in contynuall mornynge I am feble / and ve∣rye
weake / I roored for the sorow of myne harte. Lord all my desyres are before the & my sorowfull syghes are not vnknowne vnto the. Myne harie trembleth and panteth for so∣row / my strength fayleth me and euen the verye sight of myne yies cease from theyr office / wherfore them oh Lord dost thou not put awaye mine iniquitie. And yf thou put it out accordinge to the multitude of the multitude of thy mercyes / yet wash me mo¦re from myne iniquyte for yet am I not per¦feytlye purefyed / finysh thy worke / take awaye the hole offence and also the payne that is due vnto the cryme encrease thy lyght with in me / kendle myne harte with thy loue and cheryte put out all feare. Let the loue of the worlde / the loue of the flesh the loue of vayne glorye / and the loue of myselfe vtterlye departe fro me / yet styll more and more wash me from mine iniqui¦te by the whych I haue offended agenst my neyghbour / and clense me from my syn¦ne that I haue commytted agenst god. I wold haue the put awaye not onelye the faute and payne that foloweth it / but also the occasion and nourishmēt of synne
wash me I saye with the water of thy gra∣cyous fauoure / with water of which he that drinketh shall not thirst for euer / but it shall be made in hym a fontayne of ly∣uinge water runninge in to euerlastynge lyfe, Wash me with the water of my teares Wash me with the comfortable waters of thy holye scriptures that I may be enum∣bred amonge thē vnto whom thou saydest Now are ye clene for my wordes which I haue spoken vnto you / Ioan. xiij. For I knowlege mine iniquite & my synne is euer before mine yies. Although thorow the beholdinge of thy mercye and cōpassyons I maye be bolde to flye vnto the (oh Lord) yet will I not come as the pharise which prayed not but rather praysed hym selfe and despysed his neyghboure: but I come vnto the as the publicane Luc. xviij. which durst not lyfte vppe his yies vnto heauen. For I also do knowlege myne iniquite / and whyles I pō¦dre my synnes I dare not lyfte vppe myne yies / but humblinge my selfe with the pu∣blicane I saye: God be mercyfull to me a synner. My soule wauereth betwene hope
and feare / and somtyme for the feare of my synnes (which I feale and knowelege to be in me) I am ready to despayre / somtyme thorow the hope of thy mercye / I am lifted vp and comforted. Neuerthelesse because that thy mercye is greater then my myserie I wyll euer Lorde trust in the and wil sin¦ge out thy plentuous cōpassyons for euer / for I know that thou desyrest not the deth of a synner / but rather that he were cōuer¦ted and that he wold knowlege his iniqui¦te and forsake his synne / and so come to the that he maye lyue. My god graunte me that I maye lyue in the / for I knowlege my wykednesse / I know what a greuous burthen it is / how copyous / and how ieoperdyous. I am ig∣noraunce of it / I hyde it not but sette it euē before myne yies / that I maye wash it with my teares and knowlege vnto the Lorde myne vnrightwysnes agenst my self: & also my synne which I haue proudlye done a∣genst the / is euer agenst me / & therfore is it agenst me / because I haue synned agēst the And it is trulye agenst me / for it is euen a∣genst my soule & accuseth me euer before the y iudge & condemneth me euer & in euery
place: and it is so agenst me that it is euer before my face and stondeth butte agenst me that my prayer maye not perce thorow vnto the / that it myght take thy mercye fro¦me and hynder thy mercye that it can not come at me: therfore do I tremble and ther¦fore do I morne besechinge thy mercye. Therfore (oh Lord) as thou hast geuē this grace vnto me to knowe my wykednesse and to bewayle my synne: euen so accom∣plysh this thy beneuolence geuynge me a parfayte fayth / and drawynge me vnto thy sonne which hath made a full satisfaccyon for all my synnes. Geue me Lord this pre∣cyous gyfte / for euerye good gyfte and eue∣rye parfeyte gyfte is from aboue comynge from the father of lyght. Agenst the only haue I synned: & haue done that which is euell in thy sight: that thou mayst be iuste¦fyed in thy wordes: & mayst haue the victorie whē thou arte iudged I haue ouermoch synned vnto the alone for thou cōmaundedst me that I shuld lo∣ue the for thy selfe / and shuld loue all crea∣tures
for thy sake. But I haue loued a crea¦ture more then the / louinge it euen for it sel¦fe. Whate is synne / but to loue a creature for it selfe? & what is that / but to do ageynst the? Surelye he that loueth a creature for it selfe maketh that creature his god. And therfore haue I synned agenst the onlye / for I haue made a creature my god. So ha¦ue I cast the awaye / and haue bene iniuri∣ous onlye to the / for I haue not offended agenst any creature in that I haue set my trust or cōfidence in it. For it was not cō∣maunded me that I shuld loue anye crea∣ture for it self. Yf thou haddest cōmaunded me that I shuld haue loued an angell on∣lye for hym self / & I had loued monye for it selfe / then no doute I had offended agenst the angell. But syth that thou only art to be loued for thy selfe (that is to saye with¦out any respecte other of good or euell) and euerye creature is to be loued in the & for thy sake / therfore haue I surelye offended onlye agenst the / for I haue loued a crea∣ture for it selfe. But yet haue I worse done / for I haue synned euen in thy syght. I was nothinge ashamed to synne before thy face. Oh mer¦cyfull
god / how manye synnes haue I do∣ne in thy syght which I wold in no wise ha¦ue done before mortall men / yee that I wold not in any case that men shuld kno∣we. I feared men more then the / for I was blynde and loued blyndnesse / and so dyd I nother se nor once cōsydre the, I had onlye fleshlye yies / therfore dyd I onlye feare & loke on men which are flesh. But thou lo∣kedst on all my synnes & numbred thē / ther¦fore I can nother hyd them frō the / nether turne my backe and flye from thy face. Whother shall I go from thy spryte and whother shall I flye from thy face? what shall I then do? whother shall I turne me whom shall I fynde to be my defender? whom I praye you but the my God? who is so good? who is so gentle? who is so mer¦cyfull? for thou passest with out cōparison all creatures in gentlenesse. It is one of thy chefest propertyes to forgeue & be mer∣cyfull / for thorow mercye and forgeuenesse thou dost most declare thy almyghtinesse: I graunte Lorde that I haue offended on¦lye agenst the / and haue done that which is euell in thy syght / haue mercye therfore on me & expresse thy puysaunce in me / that
thou mayst be iustefyed in thy wordes: for thou hast sayed: that thou camest not to cal¦le the rightwyse / but synners vnto repen∣taunce. Iustefye me Lorde accordinge to thy wordes: call me / receaue me / and geue me grace to do true workes of repentaun∣ce. For this cause wast thou crucifyed / deed and buryed. Thou saydest also: Ioan .iij. When I am lyfted vp from of the erth / I will drawe all vnto my selfe / verefye thy wordes / drawe me after the let vs runne to gether in the swetenesse of thyne oynt∣mentes, Besides that thou saydest: Mat. xi. Come vnto me al ye that laboure / and are laden / and I will ease you. Loo I come vn¦to the laden with synnes / labouringe daye and nyght in the sorow of myne harte re∣fresh and ease me lorde that thou mayste be iustefyed and proued true in thy wordes / and mayst ouercome when thou art iudged for there are manye that saye: he shal haue no socoure of his god. God hath forsaken hym. Ouercome lorde these persones whē thou arte thus iudged of them and forsake me not at anye tyme. Geue me thy mercye and holesome socoure / & then are they vayn¦queshed. They saye / that thou wilt haue
no mercye on me / and that thou wilt cast me clene out of thy fauoure and no more re¦ceaue me / thus art thou iudged of men / & thus do men speake of the / & these are their determinacyons / but thou which arte me¦ke and mercyfull haue mercye on me / and ouercome their iudgementes / shewe thy mercye on me and let thy godlye pitye be praysed in me. Make me a vessell of thy mercye / that thou mayst be iustefyed in thy wordes and haue the victorye when men do iudge the for men do iudge the to be fir∣ce and inflexible. Ouercome their iudge∣ment with mekenesse and beneuolence / so that men maye lerne to haue compassyon on synners / and that malefactours maye be enflamed vnto repentaunce / seynge in me / thy pytye and mercye. Loo I was fashoned in weked∣nes and my mother conceaued me polluted with synne. Behold not Lorde the greuousnesse of my synnes / consyder not the multitude / but loke mercyfullye on me which am thy creature. ☞ Remembre that I am dust / and that all flesh is as wythred haye / for
Loo I am fashoned in wekednes & in syn∣ne hath my mother cōceaued me. My na∣turall mother (I saye) hath cōceaued me of cōcupiscence / & in her am I polluted with original sinne. What is original synne / but the lacke of originall iustice & of the ryght and pure innocencye which man had at his creacyon? therfore a man cōceaued & borne in suche sinne is hole croked and out of fra¦me. The flesh coueteth agenst the sprete. Reason is slender / the wyll is weake / man is frayle and lyke vanite / his senses decea∣ue hym / his ymaginacyon fayleth hym his ignoraunce leadeth him out of the right wa¦ye / & he hath infinite impedymētes which plucke hym frō goodnes and dryue hym in to euel. Therfore original synne is the roo¦te of all synnes and the nurse of all wiked¦nesse / for all be it that in euerye man of the awne nature it is but one synne yet in po∣wer it is all synnes. Thou seyst therfore Lorde what I am / and of whence I am for in originall synne (which cōteyneth al syn¦nes and iniquites in it) am I fashoned / & in it hath my mother conceaued me / syth then I am hole in synnes and enuyroned with snares one erye syde how shall I es∣cape?
for what I wold that do I not / but the euell that I wold not that do I / for I fynde a nother lawe in my membres rebel∣linge agenst the lawe of my mynde / & sub∣duynge me vnto the lawe of synne & deth. Therfore the more frayle and entangled thy godlye beneuolence seeth me / so moch the more let it lyft vppe & cōfort me. Who wold not pitye one that is syke? who wold not haue cōpassyon on hym that is dysea∣sed? Come / come thou swete Samaritane and take vppe the wounded and halfe deed cure my woundes / poure in wyne and oyle sette me vppon thy beest / bringe me in to the hostrye / cōmitte me vnto the host / take out two pence and saye vnto him: what so euer thou spendest aboue this / when I come a∣gayne I wyll recompence the. Loo thou hast loued truth / the vnknowne & secrete thinges of thy wysdō / hast thou vttered vnto me. Come most swete Samaritane / for behold thou hast loued truth / the truth (I saye) of thy promyses which thou hast made vnto mankynde / then hast thou trulye loued: for thou hast made and kepte them / so that thy
loue is nothinge els but euen to do good for in thy selfe thou arte inuaryable & im∣mutable / thou vsest not now to loue and a none not to loue (as men doo) nether doth thy loue so come & goo / but thou art such a louer as doth neuer chaunge for thy loue is verye god. Thy loue therfore wherwith thou louest a creature / is to do it good / & whom thou most louest / to them arte thou most beneficyall. Therfore what meaneth that thou louest truth / but that of thy gra∣cyous mercye thou makest vs promises / & fulfyllest them for thy truthes sake? Thou dyst promyse vnto Abraham a sonne when he was aged / thou falfylledst thy promyse in olde and baren Sara / because thou lo∣uedst truth. Thou promysest vnto the chil¦dren of Israell a lande that flowed with milke and honye / and at the last dydst geue it them / for thy truthes sake. Thou madest a promyse to Dauid sayen¦ge: I shall set vppon thy sete regall one of the frute of thy bodye / and it came euen so to passe / because thou woldest be founde true. There are other innumerable promy¦ses in which thou hast euer bene faythfull because thou louedst truth. Thou hast pro∣mysed
to synners which wyll come vnto the / forgeuenesse and fauoure / and thou hast neuer defrauded man / for thou hast lo∣ued truth. That vnthryftye sonne Luc. xv. that toke his iorney in to a farre cōtre and wasted all his goodes with covetous ly∣uinge / when he came to hym self / he retoue¦ned vnto the sayenge. Father I haue syn∣ned agenst heauen and before the / now am I not worthye to be called thy sonne / make me as one of thy hyred seruauntes, / When he was yet a greate waye of / thou sawest hym and haddest cōpassyon on hym and rannest vnto hym / fallynge vppon his necke and kyssynge hym / thou broughtest forth the best garmenth and puttest a ryn∣ge on his fynger and showes on his fete / Thou kylledst that fatted calfe and ma∣dest all the house merye sayenge / Let vs ea¦te & be merye / for this my sonne was deed and is alyue agayne / he was lost and is now founde. Why dydst thou all this Lorde God? su∣relye because thou louedst truth. Loue therfore (o father of mercyes) this truth in me / which retorne vnto the from a farre countre / runne towardes me & geue me a
kysse of thy mouth / geue me those chefe gar¦mētes / drawe me in to thy house / kylle that fatted calfe that all which trust in the ma∣ye reioyce in me / and lette vs eate to gether in spirituall feastes. Oh Lorde wilt thou exclude me alone and wilt thou not kepe this truth vnto me? yf thou shuldest loke narowlye on oure wykednesse o lorde: lor¦de who myght abyde the? But Lord thou wilt not be so strayght vnto vs / for thou louest truth: yee and that with a feruent & incomprehensible loue. Which is the truth that thou so louest? is it not thy sonne that sayde Ioan .xiiij. I am the waye / truth / and lyfe? he is the verye truth of whom all truth is named in hea∣uen and in erth / this is it that thou hast lo∣ued and in it onlye hast thou delyted for thou dydest fynde it pure & with out spotte and woldest that it shuld dye for synners / kepe therfore (Oh God) this truth / behold I am a greate synner in whom thou maist kepe it / to whom thou maist forgeue manie synnes / whom thou mayst purefye in the bloude of thy Christ / & whom thou mayst redeme thorow his passyō why (Oh lorde) hast thou geuen me this knowlege of thy
sonne / & this fayth of hym? Because I shuld se my redēpcyon and not to attayne it that I myght by that meanes be the more vexed with sorow? God forbydde / but rather that I maye perceaue the remissyon of my syn∣nes purchased by Christes bloude / and so by his grace maye obtayne it. Purge me therfore and redeme me oh Lorde (for thou hast vttered vnto me the vnknowne and secrete poyntes of thy wysdom) that this knowlege maye helpe me & brīge me vnto helth for trulie the philosofers neuer knew these thinges / they were vnknowne vnto hē / yee & vtterlye hid frō thē: and no mā kne¦we these thīges (except a fewe whō thou lo¦nest entyrelie) before thy sonnes incarnaciō The most curyous serchers of the world / I meane the wysemen of this world lyf∣ted vp their yies aboue heauen & yet coulde not fynde this thy wysdom / for thou hast hyd these thinges from the wyse & prudent / and hast opened them vnto babes / that is / to humble fishers and thy holye prophetes which also haue vttered thē vnto vs. And so hast thou vttered the vnknowne and se¦crete thinges of thy wysdom & of thy scrip∣tures vnto me / why do I know thē in vay¦ne?
I know them surelye in vayne yf they profytte me not vnto my helth and saluacy¦on. For the Philosophers when they kne∣we God by his meruelous creatures they glorifyed hym not as god nether were thā¦kefull / but wexed full of vanityes in theyr ymaginacyons and their folish hartes we∣re blinded / when they counted them selues wyse / they became soles / wylt thou suffer me Lorde to be of their numbre? God for¦byd / for thou arte euē mercye it selfe which doth neuer vtterlye forsake any man / fa∣uoure therfore Lorde fauoure and spare thy seruaunt / and commaunde hym to be of the numbre of thy babes / that the vn∣knowne secretes of thy wysdom / which thou hast opened to hym maye leade hym vnto the fountayne of wysdom which is an hye / that thou mayst be praysed in the worke of thy mercye which thou dost ex∣ercyse towardes thy seruaunte (Lorde) which neuer forsakest them that trust in the. Sprinkle me Lorde with hyso∣pe / and so shall be clene / thou shalt wash me / and then shall I be whit¦ther
then snowe. Because Lorde that thou hast loued the truth & hast opened vnto me the vnknow∣ne secretes of thy wysdome / I am well cō¦forted and I trust that thou wilt not cast me out of thy fauoure / but thou shalt sprin¦kle me with hysope and so shall I be clen∣sed. Hysope is a lowe herbe / it is hote and of a good sauoure / which sygnifyeth no∣thynge els / but thy onlye sonne oure lorde Iesu Christ / which humbled hym selfe vn∣to deeth / euen vnto the deeth of the crosse / which with the heate of his feruent chari∣te loued vs / and washed vs from oure syn∣nes in his bloude / which with the redo∣lent sauoure of his beneuolence and right¦uousnes replenyshed the hole worlde. Therfore with this hysope shalt thou sprincle me / when thou pourest apon me the vertue of his bloude: when Christ tho¦row fayth shal dwell in me: when thorow loue I am ioyned with hym: when I shall countre fayte his humylite and passyon / then shal I be clensed frō all myne vnclen¦nesse. Then shalt thou wash me with mine awne teares which flowe out of the loue of
Christ / then shall I sygh vntyll I be werye I shall water my bed euerye nyght with my teares / so that it shall swymme in them and then shalt thou wash me and I shall be whyter then snowe. Snowe is whyte and colde / but Lorde yf thou sprinkle me with hysope. I shal be more whyte then snowe for I shall be tho¦rowlye endued with thy splendent lyght which passeth all bodelye whytenesse. And when I am enflamed with that lyght / I shall for sake all my carnall cōcupiscences colde vnto wordlye thinges / and enflamed vnto heuenlye. Vnto my hearinge shalt thou geue ioye and gladnes and my bro¦sed bones shall be refreshed. Then Lord shall I pray vnto the / etlye (that is in the begynnīge of thy light) shalt thou heare my voyce & I shall heare what the lorde god shall speake in me for he shalt speake peace for his people and shall geue me peace. Lorde thou shalt geue me peace for I haue trusted in the / vnto my hearinge shalt thou geue ioye / and gladnesse / when I shal heare that cōfortable wordes that
marye herde. And what herd marye (I spe¦ake of that marye / whych sate at the fete of Iesus Mat. xxvi.) what herde she: Thy faith hath saued the / goo thy wayes in pea¦ce. Let me also heare that the thefe herde this daye shalt thou be with me in parady¦se / then shall I haue ioye for the remission of my synnes / and gladnesse for thy bounte¦ous and liberall promyses shall I not re∣ioyce / and be glad / when thou shalt geue me two fold for all my synnes? them shall I beginne to taste how swete the Lorde is then shall I lerne to be conuersaunte in he¦uenly thinges and shall saye with the Pro¦hete: how greate and copious is that swe¦enesse Lorde / which thou hast layde vppe for them that feare the / then shall I reioy∣se and be glad and my brosed bones shalbe refresshed. What are the bones which su∣stayne the flesh but the powers of oure sou¦le and reason that bere vpp the fraylte of oure flesh that he runne not hedlonge in to all vyces / that a man falle not hole in to vanyte and so consume awaye. These bo∣nes I saye are sore brosed / for the reason is verye weake / and the will is prone and readye to all myscheue / for euen now the
the flesh obeyeth not reason / but reason must obaye the flese / so that I can not re∣sist vice / for mi bones are brosed. And why are they brosed for they haue forsaken the / the fountayne of liuynge water / and haue digged for them selues casterns ful of thyn¦nes which can hold no waters / for they a∣re not filled with thy grace with out wich no man can lyue well / for without the we cā do no thinge. They trusted in their aw¦e power which is no power and therfo∣re decayed they in theyr awne folyshnesses Therfore let thy power come (Oh Lorde) and then shall these brosed bones be refres¦shed let thy grace come & that faith which worketh thorow loue. Let thy powers & giftes assiste me / & thē mi brosed bones shal be refresshed for my reason shalbe merye / my memorye glad & my will full of ioye / & thus shall they all reioyse / for aboue theyr awne naturall strength / whē they goo ab∣oute any good worke they shall procede & prospere well / nether shall they leaue it vnperfeyte / but thorow thy helpe shall they brynge it to good passe and effecte. Turne thy face from off my
synnes / and wype awaye all my wykednesse. Why lokest thou Lorde vppon my sinnes why numbrest thou them? why consyder  them so dyligentlye? dost thou not know that man is euen as a floure of the feld / why dost thou not rather loke in the face of thy Christ? Alas wretch that I am / why se I the angrye agenst me? I graunte I ha¦ue sinned / how be it for thy gentlenesse ha∣ue mercye on me. Turne thy face from off my synnes. Thy face is nothynge but thy knowlege turne awaye therfore thy know¦lege frō my sinnes I meane not that know¦lege where with thou seist and perceauest all thinges / but that wherbye thou appro¦uest & disalowest all thinges / wherbye thou alowest the workes of the ryghtwyse and condemnest the reprouable synnes of the wyked / know not my synnes on that ma∣ner that thou woldest impute them vnto me and laye them to my charge. But rather turne away thy face from my synnes that thorow thy mercye they maye be quenched loke Lorde on the ceeatuere whom thou hast wrought / loke vpon thyne awne yma¦ge. For I poore wretch haue put vpon
me the image of the deuell (that is synne) turne awaye thy face from the ymage of the deuell and be not angrye with me / and be∣hold thyne awne ymage that thou mayst ha¦ue mercye on me: O mercyfull Lorde / remembre that thou lokedst apon zacheum which dyd clym vp∣pe in to a wilde figge tre to se the. Lu. xix. and thou entredst in to his house whych thou woldest neuer haue done yf thou had¦dest loked on the image of the deuell which he had put on him / but because thou sauest thyne awne ymage in hym / thou haddest cō¦passion on hym and heledst hym. He promi¦sed to geue the halfe of his goodes to the poore / and yf he had falslye deceaued any man to restore it foure folde and he obtay∣ned mercye and health. And I bequeth my selfe euen hole vnto the nothynge reserued And promyse to serue the for euer wyth a pure harte / and will fulfylle my promyse all dayes of my lyfe wherfore then Lorde dost thou not loke on thyne ymage in me al¦so? why dost thou yet consider my synnes. Turne I besech the thy face from my syn∣nes & wype awaye all my wykednesse / wy¦pe awaye all I pray the that none remay∣ne
/ for it is writen he that kepeth the hol lawe & offendeth in one poynte is gyltye in the hole / that is to saye / hath deserued dam¦nacyon / whych is the payne of all synnes that lead vnto deth. Put out therfore all my wykednesse / that none offēde the which shuld brynge me to condemnacion. A pure harte create in me oh god and an vpright sprete make a ne∣we within mee For my harte hath forsaken me / and goeth astraye vtterlye forgettinge his awne helth it is wādred in to straunge countres & en∣sueth vanities & his yies / are in the vtmost coostes of the world I called it againe but it answered me not. It is gone / loste & sol∣de vnder synne. What nv lorde? what shall I saye. A pure harte create ī me god / an hū∣ble harte / a curteous harte / a peaceable har¦te / a gentle harte / a deuoute harte / soch an harte as wil nether do a nother man hurte / nether yet auēge him selfe whē he is offen∣ded but rather do god agēst euill. And soch an harte as will loue the aboue all thinge which will thinke of the / speake of the and thanke the which will delyte in hymnes &
spretuall songes and be hole conuersaunte in heuenlye thinges. Create this harte in me (Oh God) treate it of nothynge / that it maye be of such effiacite thorow grace as nature is neuer able to make it. This gra∣ce cometh onlye frō the in to the soule tho∣row thy creacyon it is the beautye of a pu∣re harte / it draweth vnto hym all vertue and expelleth all vyce / therfore create ī me Oh god a pure harte thorow thy grace / & make a newe an vpryght sprete in mi bo∣wels. For thy sprete shall leade me in to a right waye / which shal purge me from all erthy affectes and shall lyfte me vpp vnto heuē∣lie thynges. The louer & the thynge that is loued are both of one nature. He that lo∣ueth bodelie thinges is wordlye but he that loueth spretuall thīges is spretuall. Geue me a sprete that maye loue the & worshyppe the / the most hye sprete / for god is a sprete & they whych worshyppe hym / must wor∣shyppe hym in the sprete & verite. Geue me an vpright sprete not schinge his awne pro¦fyte and glorye / but the will and glorie of god renewe an vpryght sprete wyth in me renewe it. For my synnes haue qwen∣ched
the fyrst that thou gauest me. Geue me now a new sprete that it maye redresse that thinge whych is inueterate my soule is also a sprete & so made of the that of her selfe she is ryght for of her awne nature she loueth the aboue her selfe and desyreth all thynges for thy glorye / so that her aw∣ne naturall loue is ryght / for it cometh of the / but of her awne frowarde will is it īueterate & polluted causinge her natural loue to decaye. Make new therfore this s¦te & this loue thorow thy grace that it ma∣ye walke ī the right waye accordīge to his nature renue it (I saye) that it maye euer enflame me with heuēlye loue that it maye euer cause me to sighe vnto the / to enbrace the continuallye and neuer to forsake the. Cast me not awaye from thy face / and thy holye goste take not from me Behold Lorde I stande before thy face that I maye fynde mercye I stonde before thy benigne goodnes lokinge for thy fauoura∣ble āswere cast me not cōfused frō thy face who came euer. Lorde vnto the and went awaye confused. Who euer desyred thy
fauoure / and went wyth out it. Surelye thou passest in thy aboundant pytye both the deseruinges and also the desires of thē that praye vnto the / for thou geuest more then men can desyre yee or vnderstonde whē they haue it. It was neuer harde that thou dydst cast awaye from they face any man that euer came vnto the Shall I Oh Lorde be the first that shall be cast awaye from thy face and vtterlye confoūded? wilt thou beginne at me to confounde them that come vnto the? wilt thou neuer more haue mercye and cōpassion? God forbidde. The woman of Canane folowed the / she cryed and made a pytuous noyse / she moued thy dysciples / vnto compassion / and thou hyl∣dest thy peace / she contynued knockynge / she worshipped the and sayd. Lorde helpe me / nether yet woldest thou answere. Thy dyscyples entreated for her sayenge: let her goo for she cryeth after vs. But what was thyne answere Lorde I praye the / what dydst thou answere: for south that she wep¦te in vayne / and laboured for nought / for thou saydst that thou wast not sent but vn¦to the shepe that were perysshed of the hou¦se of Israel.
What shuld this woman do when she ha∣de these wordes? verelye euen despayre as concerninge the grace that she requyred: & yet despayred she not / but trustynge in thy mercye prayed agayne sayenge: Lorde hel∣pe me / vnto wose importunite (Lorde) thou answeredst / it is not good to take the chyl∣drens brede and cast it to hondes as though thou shuldest haue sayed departe from me you Canaanites are dogges / ye are Idola¦tres / the precyous gyftes of he venye fa∣uoure partayne not vnto you I ought not to take them a waye from the Iues whych worshyppe the true and liuynge god / and to geue thē to soch dogges as ye are which worshuppe ydolles and deuels what shalt thou now doo thou woman of Canaan? thou mayst now be a shamed and gette the awaye / for the Lorde is angrye not wyth the alone / but also thy hole nacyon. Oh Lorde god / who wold not haue bene con∣founded and haue pyked hym awaye at the¦se thy wordes? who wold not haue mum¦bled and grugged agenst the? who wolde not haue iudged the to be cruell? And yet did thys woman contynue stille in prayer. She cast not away her confidence / she to∣ke
not these harde wordes heuelye / she was n angrye / but she humbled her selfe the more and abode stylle in her petycion and sayde with good fyaunce. It is truth Lor∣de that thou sayest / but I axe nobrred / I axe not the fauoure that thchyldren shuld haue. I am a litle whe elpe and desyre the tromes whyth falle from thy chyldrens ta¦ble. Let them storys and abounde with mi¦racles / and other gracyous fauours / but let not me be destytute of thys trumme of grace / that my douhter maye be delyuered from the fendes possession for the whelpes do rate of the trummes whych faile from theyr masters tables. Behold wat fayth / whate trust / and what humylyte was in thys women? therfore thou / not dyspleased with her ymportunate instaunce but reioy¦singe in her excellēt constauncie dydst saye O woman greate is thy fayth / be it vnto the as thou wilt. Why are these thynges wryten Lord god? that we maye lerne to trust in the / that me maye humblye and de∣uoutlye continue in prayer / for thou wil geue it yf men be greadye. But the kingdome of heauen suffereth vio¦lence / and they that make violence vnto is
catche it / for what thinges so euer are wri¦ten are writen for oure lerninge that tho∣row pacience and comforte of the scriptu∣res we maye haue hope. Cast me not therfore lorde frō thy face which stond wepinge and way linge daye & night before thy face / not that thou shul∣dest deliuer me frō the bodelye oppression of deuyls / but that thou wilt delyuer my soule frō his spirituall power & dominion. Let me not be shamed (O swete Iesu) for in the onlye haue I trusted I haue no helth or comforte but in the o Lorde / for al haue forsakē me / euē my brothrē & children haue cast me of and myne awne bowels ab¦horre me. I haue no nother helper / but on∣lye the. Cast me not therfore awaye from thy face / & take no thy holye sprete for me There is nomā which can saye that Iesus is the Lorde but by the holye gost therfore yf I call vppon the lord Iesu / that do I in the holye gost / yf I be sorye for my synnes which are passed / yf I are forgeuenesse / this do I verelye. by the holye gost. Therfore I besech the take not fro me thy holye gost / but that it maye be with me / and laboure wyth me / for we wote not what to desyre
as we ough to do. But the sprete helpeth oure infirmityes and maketh intercession for vs / that is / maketh vs to praie with such sorowfull groninges as can not be expres∣sed with tongue therfore take not awaye this thi holye sprete fro me / that he maye teach me to praye / and helpe me in my la∣boure and may cause me to continue in pra¦yers and teares / that at the lengh I maye finde fauoure before thy face and maye ser¦ue the all dayes of my lyffe. Make me agayne to reioyse in thy sauynge helth and strengthen me with a pryncypall sprete. he is a greate thinge that I desyre o Lorde Iow be it sith thou arte god a greate Lor∣de / and kynge ouer all goddes / he doth the iniurye which asketh small thinges of the. All transitorye and corruptible thinges a¦re but small in thy syght: but spyrytuall & euerlastynge thinges are greate / and pre∣cyous. Take awaye the sprete / and soule from the bodye / and what remayneth but most vyle dounge dust & a vayne shadowe therfore euē so moch difference is betwene the sprete and the bodye / as is betwene the
bodye & his shadowe / so maye I conclude that he which asketh bodelye thynges as∣keth but vayne tryfles but he that desyreth spyrituall thynges doth surelye desyre gre∣at thinges / but speciallye he that desyreth thy sauinge helthe / what is thy sauīge helth but Iesus thy sonne? which is verye god / & euerlastinge liffe / why shall I not then as¦ke of the this thy sauyoure / sith thou arte amyghtye and most liberall father / whych gauest hym vnto the deeth of the crosse for me. Now sith thou hast so offered hym for me / why shuld I be ashamed to aske hym of the? It is a great and noble present ne∣ther am I worthie to haue such a gift how be it it becometh thy worthy lyberalyte to geue such noble gyftes / for this therfore ty¦ne ineffable gentlenesse I dare presume to come boidlye vnto the and to desyre thy sa¦uinge helth in whom I myght fullye reioy¦ce. For yf of his carnal father any sonne as¦ke fysh / will he teach him a serpent. And yf he aske an egge / will he geue hym a scorpi∣on? or yf he aske breed / will he geue hym a stone? Now yf carnall fathers beynge euell and synners / wil geue vnto theyr chil¦der good gyftes whych they haue receaued
of the: how moch moare thou heuenlye fa¦ther whych of thyne awne substance arte good / wilt geue a good sprete to thē that desyre it of the? Beholde thy sonne whych is retourned from a farre countre sorowin¦ge and repentinge / asketh of the the fish of fayth / for as the fish lyeth secrete vnder the water / euen so is fayth of such thynges as are not sene / he asketh I saye a true fayth that he maye reioyce in thy sauinge helth: wilt thou reath hym a serpent? wilt thou geue hym the venome of vnfaythfulnes which proceadeth from that old and cro∣ked serpent the deuell I desyre of the o Lor¦de the egge of hope / that euen as out of an egge we hope for a chyken / so thorow ho∣pe / that thou wilt graunte me to come vn¦to the syght of thy sauynge health that out of my hope maye come this holesome sight as the chicke doth out of the egge. I desy∣re the egge of hope / that my soule thorow hope maye be sustayned in this vale of tea¦res and may reioyce in thy sauinge helth. Wilt thou geue me the scorpion of despera¦cyon that as a scorpion hath poyson in the ende of her taile / so I in the last ende of mi¦liffe shulde reserue synne / delytinge my sel¦fe
and taking he my pleasure with the enti¦semētes of this worlde which seme beauti¦full and flateringe / euē as a scorpion doth in the face. I desyre of the also (o Lorde) the breed of Christes cherite by the which he doth com¦munycate hym selfe (euen as breed) vnto all men / that I maye euer reioyce in thy sa¦uynge / helth / wilt thou geue me a stone / that is to saye hardnes of harte? God for∣bid / why shall I them my struste for to de∣syre and / and optayne greate thinges of the o Lorde / seinge thou sturrest me vpp / and byddest me aske and knocke / euen tyll I se me importunate? And what thynge can I aske whych thou shalt be better content with all / or els that shuld be moare hole∣some for me them that thou shuldest make me reioyse in thy sonne oure sauinge helth. Now haue I tasted how swete the Lor¦de is / how easye / and pleasaunte hys bur∣then is. I remember whate peace and tran¦quilite of mynde I was in / when I ioyed in god. And reioysed in Chryst my Lorde and sauyoure / therfore am I now in mo∣are sorow / for I know what goodnes. And commodylye I haue loste / ther∣fore
will I crye more importunatlye: Ma¦ke me agayne to reioyse in thy sauīge helth restore me agayne that thynge whych my sinnes haue lost. Restore me that whych thorow my faute is perysshed in me. Resto¦re me (I besech the for his sake that euer is on thy ryght hande and maketh intercession for vs) thy gracious fauoure / that I maye perceaue that thorow hym thou art pace∣fyed towardes me / that it maye be as a sea¦le vppon my harte / and that I maye saye wyth the Apostle Paule Gala. ij. I am crucefyed with Chryst / I lyue verelye / yet now not I / but Chryst lyueth in me. But because my frayltye is greate / strēght me wyth a pryncypall sprete that no trou∣bles or afflyctions maye seperate me from Chryst / that no feare may cause me to re∣nye the and that no paynes maye make me slyde from the. My strength is not suffycy∣ent to resyst / and fyght wyth that olde ser∣pent / and to preuayle agenst hym. Peter hath taught me how greate oure infirmitye is / he sawe the with his bodely yies (Lorde Iesu) & was most familiarlye conuersaunt wyth the: he tasted of thy glo¦rye in the mountayne / whē thou wast trās¦figured:
he harde the fathers voyce: he sawe thy manifold and wondrous workes / yee and thorow thy power dyd hym selfe ma∣ny miracles. He walked on his fete vppon the waters / and harde daylye thy mightye and swete wordes: he thought hym selfe most feruent and hote in the faith and say¦de that he was readye to go with the both in to preson & vnto verye deeth. And when thou toldest hym that he shuld denye the he beleued the not the trusted in his awne strength / and trusted more vnto hym selfe beynge but a man / then vnto the beynge ve¦rye god. But when the handmayden sayde vnto hym. Thou arte of the same cōpanye / he was afrayde by and by and denyed it. There came a nother mayde and sayed: Surelye thou arte of the same folke: And he denyed the agayne. He coude not stande before wemē / how shuld he then haue stonde before kynges & tyrauntes? And when he was yet once mo¦are enquired of the bystanders and was accused to be one of his disciples / he began¦ne to curse and to swere that he knew the not / what thinke you he sayed? I suppose that he sware by god and by the lawe of
Moses that he knewe the not / addīge such wordes. Thinke you that I am the disci∣ple of this Sama ane which / deceaueth the people which is inspired with the deuil and destroyeth oure lawe? I am the disci∣ple of Moyses / and knowe not frō when∣ this felowe is. Blissed be God that they acused enquyrīge any further / for els wold he neuer haue ceased denyenge the / so that a thousande interrogacyons wolde haue made a thousand staite negacyons: yee a thousand curses and periuryes: yet were these interrogacyons but wordes / what wold he haue done (I praie the) yf they had scourged hym & buffeted hym well? Tru∣lye he wold haue sought & proued all mea∣nes / denyenge / forsweringe / cursinge / and blaspheminge vntyll that he had escaped their handes. But thou most meke Lorde lo¦kedst backe vppon hym and by and by he knowleged his offence. Nether yet durst he lepe in to the myd∣des of them and confesse the to be the son¦ne of God / for he was not yet strengthed with power from aboue / so that with our doute he wold haue denyed the agayne / yf he had sene any ieopardye at hande / therfo¦re
as it was most mere for hym / he went forth and wepte bitterlye. But thou after thy resurrecyon appearedst vnto hym and confortedst hym / & yet kyd he hym selfe for feare of the Iues? he sawe the so gloryou∣slye assendynge vnto heauē & was strengt∣hed by the syght and comforte of Angels / & yet durst he not go abroade / for he had ler∣ned by experyence to knowe his awne fra∣gilite / and had proued his wekenesse. ¶Therfore dyd be tarye and wayte for the holye ghost which was promysed / whē he was come and had fylled Peters harte with grace / then stepte he forth: then be∣ganne he to speake / and then with greate power and sygnes bare he wytnesse of thy resurreccyon. Then feared he nether the hyt preastes nether yet kynges / but reioysed in tribula∣cyons & receaued the crosse with all mth and gladnes. Therfore strengthen me Lor¦de with a principall sprete that I maye con¦tynuallye reioyce in thy sauynge helth / or els can I not beare so manye assautes a∣genst me. The flessh coueteth contrarye to the sprete. The worlde assayleth me on eue¦ryesyde. The deuell slepeth not.
Geue me the strenght of thy sprete that the there maye fallely my syde a thousand an then thousande by my right hande that I maye be a sure and stronge witnesse of thy sayth. For yf Peter whom thou enduedst with so manye fauourable gyftes / dyd fall so wretchedlye / what shuld I doo Lorde which haue nether sene thy naturall pre∣sence: nether haue tasted of thy glorie in the mountayne: nether haue sene thy gracious myracles: ye and haue scarcelye perceaued thy meruelous workes / & haue neuer hard thy voyce / but haue bene euer subdued vn¦der synne therfore strength me with a prin¦cipall sprete that I maye perseuer / in thy seruyce and geue my lyffe for thy sake. I will enstructe the wyked that they maye knowethy wayes / and the vngodlye shalbe conuerted vn¦to the. Ascribe not this oh Lorde vnto presum¦cyō / yf I go aboute to the teach the vngod¦lye thy wayes / for I desyre not to teach thē as I now am wyked / vngodlye / and vnder the bōdes of synne / but yf thou make me a∣gayne
to reioyce in thy sauīge helth: yf thou strenghten me with a principal sprete: and yf also thou sette me fre / then shall I teach the vngodlye thy wayes. ¶Nether is this harde vnto the / which of verye stones canst rayse vp chyldren vnto Abraham / ne∣ther can my synnes be impedimēt vnto the yf thou wilt do this / but rather where sin¦ne is so abundaunte / there aboundeth gra¦ce Paule yet brethinge out threateninges and slaughter agenst the disciples of the lor¦de receaued cōmissyon that yf he founde a∣ny whether they were men or wemē which folowed the & professed thy fayth / he shuld bringe them presoners to Hierusalē. And forth was he goynge lyke a mad harebray∣ne and as a raueninge volfe / for to straye abrode / rauysh and kylle thy shepe. But whylles he was yet in his iorney euen in the hete of his persecucyon / and in actuall doynge of his synne / whyles he was perse∣cutinge the and wold haue slayne thy cho∣sen / hauynge no maner of preparatyue vn∣to grace / nether yet knowlege of his syn∣ne / when with harte and will he was thy∣ne aduersarye / blasphemed and cursed the. Behold the voyce of thy merciable pitye
vnto hym sayeng: Saute / Saule why per¦secute me? by the which voyce he was im¦medyatlye both sayed alonge and raysed vp he was layede alonge and ouerthrow∣ne as concernynge his bodye / but he was raysed vppe with the mynde thou raysedst hym vp that was in the slepe of darke yg∣norauncye and pouredst in thy gloryous lyght in to those yies which were oppres∣sed with this blynde slepe: thou shewedst hym thy sauourable face and endued hym with thy gracyous mercye. Then was he raysed as it had bene from deeth / he ope∣ned his yies / he sawe the and sayed: Lorde what wilt thou that I doo? And after dydst thou sende a shepe to his wolfe / for thou commaundedst Ananias to go vnto hym: And then was he baptysed and anon was he replenyshed with the holye ghoste and was made a chosen vessell to beare thy name before kynges / nacyons and the chil¦der of Israel. And with out delaye he en∣tred in to the synagoges & preached thy na¦me stoutelye / affirmīge that thou arte Chri¦ste / He disputed / preuayled and confounded the Iues. Behold Lorde euen streyte of a persecutoure / thou madest hym a preacher
and such a preacher that laboured more thē all the other apostles. O / how greate is thy power / yf thou wylt of a wyked man make a ryght wyse / or of a persequntoure a preacher / who shall forbyd the? who shall resyst the? who maye saye vnto the / why dost thou so? All thinges that thou woldest haue thou made in heauen and in erth /  these and in all bottomlesse depth. Therfore impute it not to arrogācye yf I couete thorow thy power & not thorow myne awne to teach the wyked thy wayes for I knowe that I can offer nothynge which cā be so acceptable ī thy godlye sight this is the most pleasaunte sacrifice / & also for my singulare profite / now yf thou chaū¦ge me in to a nother man / thē wyll I teach the wyked thy wayes / not the wayes of Plato & Aristotle / not the intricate & sole proposycyōs of mānes witte / not the instru¦ctions of philosophie / not the paynted wor¦des & vayne coloures of the rethoricyans. Not wordlye maters & policyes / not vnfru¦tefull wayes of vanitye / not wayes that l¦ad men īto deeth: but thy wayes & thy {pre}cep∣tes which lead vnto lyffe / nother wil I te∣ach thē ōlye one waye but manie waies for
manye are thy cōmaundmentes / how be it all the wayes ende in one / that is in loue & charite / which doth so cōbynde the fayth∣full hartes / that they haue one mynde and one will in god. Or els maye we vnderstā¦de by thy manye wayes / the diuerse maner of lyuinge / wherin euerye man walketh ac¦cordinge to his vocacyō: some maryed / so∣me lyuinge chaste in wedowhod / some vir¦gyns and so forth / these walke after diuer∣se wayes vnto their heuenlye inheritaunce euerye man chosynge one in the which he maye best subdue his rebellious membres. Thus will I teach the wyked thy wayes accordinge to their capacite and cōdicyon. And the vngodlye shalbe cōuerted vnto the for I will preach vnto them not my selfe / but Christ crucyfied: and they shalbe con∣uerted not vnto my prayse / but vnto the geuynge the all honoure and prayse / they shal leaue their awne wayes and come vn¦to thyne / that they may walke in them and so cōsequentlye attayne vnto the. Delyuer me from bloudes (oh God) the God of my hefth / and me tongue shall triumphe vppon thy
ryghtwysenes. I am stifled in moch bloude / and frō the depth of it shall I crye vnto the Lorde / lor¦de herke vnto my voyce. Tarye not lorde for I am euen at the wynte of deeth / this bloude that I speake of are my synnes / for as the bodelye lyffe cōsysteth in bloude / euē so is the lyffe of a synner in his synne: poure out the bloude / and the beest dyeth: poure out the synne knowleginge it vnto God / & the synner dyeth and is made rightwyse. Nether am I wropped in bloude / but ouer whelmed & drouned in bloudes / full strea∣mes of bloudes do driue me vnto helle / hel¦pe me Lorde / lest I perysh. Oh god which gouernest all thinges / which onlye cāst de∣lyuer me / in whose hande is the sprete of lyf¦fe / tyd and purge me frō these bloudes. De¦lyuer me from bloudes (oh God) the auctor of my helth / God in whom onlye cōsysteth my saluacyō. Delyuer me Lorde / as thou de¦lyuerest Noe from the waters of the floude Delyuer me as thou delyuerest Loth from the fyre of Sodom. Delyuer me as thou de¦lyueredst the chyldren of Israell from the depth of the red see / delyuer me as thou de¦liueredst
Ionas from the belye of the wha¦le / delyuer me as thou deliuerest the thre children from the furnace of burninge fyre Delyuer me as thou deliueredst Peter frō the peryll of the see. Deliuer me as thou de¦liueredst Paule frō the depe of the see. De∣liuer me as thou hast deliueredst infinite synners frō the power of deeth / & from the gates of hell. And then shall my tōgue tri∣umphe thy ryghtwysenes / that is / for thy ryghtwysenes which I shall feale and per¦ceaue in me thorow thy gracious fauoure For thy rightwysenes (as thappostle sayeth Roma .iij.) cometh by the fayth of Iesus Christ vnto all & vppon all thē that bele∣ue in hym / then shall my tōgue triūphe in praysinge this thy ryghtwysnes / cōmendin¦ge thy fauoure / magnifyenge thy pitye kno¦wleginge my sinnes / that thy mercye maie be declared in me which wold vouchsaffe to iustefye soch a greate synner / & that all men maye knowe that thou sauest them which trust in the & deliuerest thē frō extre¦me anguysh & aduersyte o lorde oure God. ¶Lorde open thou my lyppes: and then my mouth shall shewe
forth thy prayse. Thy prayse is a greate thinge o Lorde / for it proceadeth out of thy foūtayne wher¦of no synner drinketh. It is no gloryous prayse that cometh of a synners mouth / de¦liuer me therfore frō bloude (oh God) the god of my helth & my tōgue shall magnifye thy rightwysenes. And thē shalt thou lorde open my lippes & my mouth shall shew forth thy prayse / for thou hast the kaye of Dauid which shettest & no mā openeth / & openest and no man shetteth / therfore open thou my lyppes as thou openedst the mouthes of infantes and suckelinges / out of whose mouthes thou hast stablyshed thy prayse. These trulye were thy Prophetes / Apost∣les and other sayntes which haue praysed the with a syngle and pure harte & mouth / and not the Phylosophers and oratou∣res which haue sayed / We wyll magnefye oure tongue / oure lyppes be in oure aw∣ne power / who is oure god? They opened their awne mouthes / and thou openedst them not / nether yet stablishedst thy prayse out of their mouthes. Thy infauntes Lor∣de praysed the and despysed them selues.
The Philosophers went aboute to prai¦se them selues and magnifye their awne na¦me. Thy suckelinges extolied thy fame & glorye which they knew thorow heuenlie fauoure. The philosophers knowinge the onlye by naturall creatures / coulde neuer perfeytlye expresse thy renowne. Thy sayn¦tes magnefied the with their harte / mouth & good workes. The Philosophers onlye with wordes and theyr awne sotle ymagi∣nacyōs / thy chyldren haue spred thy glorye thorow out all the world. The Philoso∣phers haue enstructe but a fewe of theyr awne adherentes. Thy frendes with spre∣dinge thy glorie haue cōuerted innumera∣ble men from synne vnto vertue and vnto true felicite. The Philosophers nether kne¦we true vertues nether yet true felycite. Thy beloued haue preached openlye thy bounteous gentlenes and merciable fauou¦re / which thou shewedst in thy deare son∣ne vnto all the worlde. But the Philoso∣phers coulde neuer attayne to knowe it. Therfore out of the mouth of infauntes & suckelinges hast thou stablyshed thy pray∣se. For it hath euer pleased the to exalte the humble and bringe lowe the proude / now
seynge thou dost euer resyst the proude / ge∣ue me true humilite that thou maist stablish thy prayse by my mouth. Geue me a chyldes harte / for excepte I turne backe & become as a chyld I can not entre in to the kyngdo∣me of heauen / make me as one of thy infaun¦tes or suckelinges / that I maye euer hange on the teates of thy wysdome for thy teates are better then wyne / and thy wysdome better then all rychesse / so that nothynge can be compared vnto it / for it is to men an infinite treasure which they that vse a∣re made parte takers of the frendshippe of God / therfore yf thou make me a child then shalt thou stablish thy prayse in mouth for then shalt thou open my lyppes and my mouth shall shewe forth thy prayse & shall perfeytlye declare it euen as thou hast pu∣blished it by the mouth of thyne infauntes and suckelinges. If thou hadst desyred sacrifices I had suresye offered thē but thou de¦lightedst not in burnt sacrifices. My mouth lorde shall shew for thy glo∣rious fame / for I knowe that this thingeis most acceptable vnto the / syth thou sayest
by the Prophete Psalme .xlix. the sacrifice of prayse shall glorifye me / and by that mea¦nes shall I be entysed to shew hym my sa∣uynge helth / therfore will I offer prayse vn¦to the / euen the prayse of infauntes and suc¦kelynges for my synnes. And why shall I offer for my synnes rather prayse then sa∣crifice? for yf thou haddest desyred sacrifi∣ces I had surelye offred them / but thou de∣lyghtedst not in burnt sacrifices / cāst thou be pacefyed with the bloude of calues / or gootes: will thou eate the flesh of bulles / or drinke the bloude of gootes? Other dost thou desyre golde which possessest heauen and erth? other wilt thou that I sacrifyce my bodye vnto the which desyrest not the deeth of a synner / but rather that he were conuerted and lyue? Neuerthelesse I wyll chasten my flesh in a measure that thorow thy grace it ma∣ye be subdurd vnto reason and obey it / for in this poynte also yf I passe measure and bringe my bodye so lowe that it is on apte to serue my neyghboure and to do that offi¦ce which is apoynted me of god / it shall be imputed vnto me for synne. Let youre ser∣uynge of god be resonable sayth the apostle
Roma .xli. And thou hast sayed also by the Prophete I require mercye & not sacrifice Ose .vi. Therfore shall my mouth shewe forth thy prayse / for this oblacyon doth ho∣noure the / and sheweth vs the waye vnto thy sauynge helth. My harte is readye (Oh God) my harte is readye / it is readye tho∣row thy grace to do all thinges which are pleasaunte vnto the: this one thinge haue I founde most acceptable vnto the / that wyll I offer vnto the / that shall euer bein my harte / on that shall my lippys euer be harpinge. Yf thou haddest desyred a bode∣lye sacrifyce I wold surelye haue geuen it the / for my harte is readye thorow thy gra∣ce to fulfyll thy wyll: but in such burnt sa∣crifice hast thou no delyght / Thou madest the bodye for the sprete / therfore seakest thou spirituall thinges and not bodelye / for thou sayest in a certayne place Prouer. xxiij. My sonne geue thyne harte vnto me / this is the sacrifice that pleaseth the. Let vs offer vnto the an harte repentinge with so¦row of oure synnes and enflamed with the loue of heuenlye thynges and then wylt thou desyre no more / for with such a sacrifi¦ce wylt thou be content.
A sacrifice to God is a broken sprete / a contrite and humble har∣te thou shalt not despyse (o God). A broken sprete & not broken flesh plea∣seth the (o Lorde) for the flesh is broken and vexed because he hath not the carnall thin∣ges that he desireth / or els fealeth in hym¦selfe such thinges as he hateth. But the spre¦te is broken & vnquyeted for his faute / be∣cause he hath offended agenst God whom he loueth. He soroweth that he hath sinned agenst his maker & redemer / that he hath despysed his bloude / that he hath not regar¦ded such a good & louynge father: this bro∣ken and sorowinge sprete is vnto the a sa∣crifice of most swete sauoure which not withstondinge hath his cōfeccyon of most bitter spices / euen of the remembraunce of oure synnes / for whyles oure synnes are gathered to gether in to the mortoure of the harte / and beaten with the pestle of cō∣punccyon / and made in to prouder & wate¦red with teares / therof is made an oynt∣ment and sacrifice most swete which redo∣lent offerynge thou wylt not despyse / for thou wilt not despyse a contrite & humble
harte. Therfore he that breaketh his sto∣nie harte which is made with the most har¦de stones of synne / that he maye therof pre¦pare an oyntmēt of repētaunce in abūda∣unce of teares / not despayringe of the mul¦titude & greuousnes of his sinnes / but hum¦bly offeringe this sacrifice vnto the he shal in no wyse be despysed of the / for a broken & humble harte wilt thou not despyse oh god. Marye magdalene whych was a no∣table synner made such an oyntment: and put it in the alablaster boxe of her harte: she feared not to entre in to the Pharesees house / she humbled her selfe flatte before thy fete / she was not a shamed to wepe at thy mele tyde / she coude not speake for in∣warde sorow / but her harte melted īto tea¦res / with the which she washed thy fete / she wyped thē with her here / anoynted thē with oyntmente & ceased not kyssinge them who euer sawe such a nother thinge? ye or who hath euer harde of a thinge lyke vnto this. Surelye her sacrifice pleased the well and was so acceptable that thou prefer∣redst it aboue the Pharyse whych in hys awne syght was ryghtewyse / for it maye  gathered of thy wordes. Luce. vij.
That there was so moch difference betwe¦ne the rightewissenes of marye and the pha¦rise as there was difference betwene the∣se: to washe the fete with water / & to wash them with teares: to kysse one on the face and not to cease to kysse the fete: to anoyn¦te the hed with oyle / and to anoynte the fe¦e with most precyous oyntmēt: yee moch more precelled he the pharise / for he ne∣ther gaue the water / kysse nor oyle. O grea¦te is thy power Lorde / great is thy myght which declareth it selfe most cheflye in spa¦cinge / and hauynge compassyon. Now se I well that a contrite and meke harte thou shalt not despyse oh Lorde. And therfore endeuoure I miselfe to offer such am harte vnto the Neter is it ynough that I saye so outwardlye / for thou arte a god which serchest oure hartes & reynes. Accepte therfore thys my sacryfyce: and yf it be vnperfeyte / amende thou the defau∣te whych onlye arte of power that to do: that it maye be a burnt sacrifyce / all hole enflamed wyth the here of thy bounteous cheryte that it maye be acceptable vnto the or at the leste that thou despyse it not for yf thou despyse it not I know well that
I shall finde fauoure before the / and then shall none of thy sayntes other in heauen or erth despyse me. Deale gentlye of thi fauourable beneuolence with zion Let the wal¦les of Hierusalem be bist agayne. Because it is wryten Psalme .xviij. vnto the holye man thou shalt be holye / & wyth the innocent shalt thou deale innocentlye with the pure and chosen shalt thou do pu¦relye / and with the wyked shalt thou playe ouerth warte: I am verye desyrous that al men were saued and that they shuld com vnto the knowlege of the truth: whych thī¦ge were verye necessarye for them and al∣so for my profyte / for by theyr prayers ex∣hortacyons / and examples I myght ryse from this filthye synne / and be prouoked daylye to procede vnto better. I besech the therfore oh Lord although I be a synner / that thou of thy fauourable beneuolence woldest deale gentlye wyth zion: that the walles of Hierusalem myght be bylt agay¦ne / zion is thy church / for zyon by interpre¦tacion signifieth a footehill or a place whe¦re a man maye se farre aboute hym:
And euen so thy church thorow the grace of the holye gost beholdeth a farre off the glorye of God accordynge to the capacite of this lifte / and therfore sayed the Apost∣le .ij. Corinth .iij. all we with an vncoue∣red face beholdynge as in a glasse the glo∣rye of the Lorde / after the same ymage are transformed from glorye to glorye as by the sprete of the Lorde. Lord god how small is thy church at thys daye? almost the hole world is fallen from the there are many mo myscreauntes then christen. And yet emonge the chrysten how many are there which forsake worldlie thī¦ges & seke the glorie of the Lorde. Surulye ye shal finde fewe / in comparyson of them which are addicte to wordlye thīges who¦se god is theyr belye & glorye to theyr sha∣me and confusyon / Deale gentlye Lorde of thy fauourable beneuolence wyth zyon that it maye be encreased both in multitu∣de & in good lyuynge. Beholde frō heauē & deale gentlye as thou arte wont to do that thou wilt send emonge vs the fyre of thy cheryte / whych maye consume all oure sunnes. Deale Lorde accordynge to thy fauourable beneuolence / and do not with
vs after oure deseruinge / nether yelde thou vs agayne accordynge to oure iniquytyes but ordre vs accordinge to thy greate mer¦cye. Thou arte Lorde oure father and rede¦mer / thou arte oure hope / and euerlastyn∣ge helth. Euerye man desyreth goodnes of he / yf thou geue it them / then shall they ga∣ther it: yf thou open thy hande all shalbe fylled wyth plentye / when thou turnest a∣waye thy face / then are they astōnyed: whē thou gatherest in theyr breth then are they deed and returne in to erth. And agayne when thou brethest on them / then are they created a new: and thus renuest thou the face of the erth Psalme .ciiij. Lorde I pra∣ye the whate profyte is there in the damna¦cyon of so manye thousande men? Hell is fylled and thy church doth daylye decrease Aryse Lorde / why slepest thou so longe, Aryse / and differe not vnto the ende / Dea∣le gentlye of thy fauourable beneuolence with zyon / that the walles of Hierusalem maye be buylded agayne / what is Hieru∣salem (whych by interpretacyon signifieth the vysion of peace) but the holye congre∣gacion and citye of the blessed whych is ou¦re mother? Her walles were decayed whē
Lucifer with his aungels fell / in to who∣se places are the rightwyse men receaued. Deale therfore gentlye (oh Lorde) with zy¦on / that he numbre of thy chosen maye shor¦tlye be fulfylled / & that the walles of Hye∣rusalē maye be edefyed and finyshed with newe stones whych shall euer prayse the and endure euerlastinglye. Then shalt thou accepte the sa¦crifice of ryghtwysnes / obsaeions & burnt offeringes: them shal they laye vppon thyne altare wanton casues. When thou hast delt gentlye of thy fauou¦rable will & beneuolence with zyon / then shalt thou accepte the sacrifice of rightwis¦nes / for thou shalt consume it with burnin¦ge fyre of thy loue & cheryte / & so acceptedst thou the sacryfyces of Moses and Helias. And then acceptest thou the sacrifyces of rightwysnes / whē thou fattenest with thy grace the soules which endeuoure them sel¦ues to lyue ryghtwyslye / what profiteth to offer sacrifices vnto the whē thou accep∣test thē not oh Lorde? How many sacryfi∣ces
offer we now a dayes whych are not pleasaunte vnto the but rather abhomina∣ble? for we offer not the sacrifices of ryght wysnes / but oure awne ceremonyes: and therfore are they not accepted. Where is now the glorye of the Apostlee? where is the valyaunte perseueraunce of martyrs? where is the frute of preachers? where is that holye simplycyte of them that vsed to lyue solitarye? where are the vertues and workes of the Chrysten which were in ol¦de tyme? Then shalt thou accepte theyr sa∣crifyces / when thou shalt decke and gar∣nish them with thy grace and vertues Also yf thou deale gentlye with zyon of thy fauourable beneuolēce / then shalt thou delight in sacrifices of ryghtwysnes / for the people shall beginne to lyue well / to kepe thy cōmaundemētes & to deale iustlye & so shall thy people be endued wyth thy bene∣fyted & blessinge. Thē shall the oblacious of the preastes & of the clergye be accepta∣ble vnto the / for they shal forsake their car¦nall affeccyon & endeuoure thē selues vn∣to a more perfeyte liffe / & so shall the oynt¦mēt of thy blyssinge descende vppon theyr heddes. Then shall the burnt offerynges
of the relygious be pleasaunt to the / for they shall cast out all drousye sluggeshnes and false confidence / and be hoellye enfla∣med and made perfayte with the burninge fyre of goddes loue. Thē shall the bisshop∣pes and preachers put calues vppon thy∣ne altare / for after they are consummate in all kynde of vertue and replenysshed wyth thy holye sprete / they shall not feare to ge∣ue theyr lyues for theyr shepe what is thy∣ne altare swete Iesu but thy crosse where vppō thou wast offered? what sygnifyeth a wanton calfe / but oure bodye. Therfore thē shall they put calues on thyne altare / whē thei shal offer theyr awne bodies vnto the crosse / that is vnto all afflictions & euē vnto the verye deeth for thy names sake. Then shall the church florish and dilate her coostes / then shall thy prayse be noy∣sed from the last ende of the worlde / then shall ioye / and gladnesse fulfyll the hole worlde. Then shall thy sayntes reioyce in glorye & shall make mirth in their māciōs waytin∣ge for vs in the loude of the lyuynge. Accō¦plish in me euē now Lorde that thē / which I so ofte name / that thou maist haue com∣passiō
on me accordinge to thy greate mer∣cye / that thou mayst receaue me for aburnt sacrifice of rightwisnes for a holie oblaciō for a sacrifice of good lyuinge / and for a cal¦fe to be offered on thyne altare or crosse / by the which I maye passe from thy vale of miserye vnto that ioye which thou hast pre¦pared for them that loue the. Amen. ¶To fyll vp the leffe we haue touched certayne places which we thou most neces¦sarye to edefie the congregacion of Christ. ¶Of fayth. FIrst dere brethren ye ought to geue diligent hede that you maye purelye vnderstonde what fayth is and what fru∣tes procede out of her / And to cōclude the summe in fewe wordes / fayth is a sure per∣suasyon & full knowlege that God for his truth and ryghtwysnes sake wyll fulfyll such promyses / as he hath made vnto vs of his mercye and sauoure / which sure persua¦syon must be geuen from god .i. Corin. xij. For it can nother be goien by mannes po∣wer / nether yet retayned. Therfore with feare and tremblinge performe that helth which is begōne in you / for it is God that worketh in you both the wyll and also the deed / euē at his awne pleasure. And se that
with all mekenes ye submitte youre selues vnto the vocacyon of god / not sekynge the libertye of the flesh / nether yet despysinge good workes / for fayth doth mortefye the flesh and her workes / and the sprete of god which resteth in a faythfull man helpeth oure infirmitye and sighteth with out in∣termissyon agenst synne / the deuell and the worlde. ¶The power of fayth: THe power of fayth is to iustefye vs: that is / to dispoyle vs from all oure vices & laye them on Christes backe which hath pacefyed the fathers wrath towardes vs: and to endne vs with a nothers right∣wysnes / that is Christes / so that I and all my synnes are Christes / and Christ with all his vertues are myne / for he was bor∣ne for vs and geuen vnto vs. Esaye. ix, Ro¦ma. viij. To obtayne this rightwisnes god the father requireth nothīge of vs but that we beleue hym and make hym no lyar. He that beleueth that God of his mercye hath made vs these promises and that for his tru¦thes sake he will fulfylle them / he setteth to his seale that god is true. But he that bele∣ueth not or douteth of this (as moch as in hym is) he maketh God a lyar .i. Ioan. v.
for why shuldest thou doubte in hym excep¦te thou thoughtest that be were a lyar and wolde not kepe his promesse which he ma¦de? Now yf thou counte god (which is the verye truth) to be a lyar / arte thou not wor¦thy a thousande damnacyons? ¶The worke of fayth. FAyth worketh by charite / for when my raginge conscience which fealeth hr synne is pacefyed and sette at one with god thorow fayth / then remembrynge the feruēt loue of god towardes me I can not but loue my neyghboure agayne / for there is no man that hartelye loueth the father & can hate the sonne / and all though the son∣ne be naught and vnthriftye / yet for his fa¦thers sake he will helpe to better hym and euen lamēt and be sorye for the sonnes wy¦kednesse. Lykewyse yf we hartelye loue God for his infinite benefytes done vnto vs / then can we not hate that creature which he hath made after his awne lyke∣nes / whom god the father loueth so tender∣lye that he gaue his awne sonne vnto the deeth to redeme hym / yee & whom he hath adopted (thorow Christ) to be his sonne & heyre. Nowe all be it we se no kindnes in this man for which we shuld loue hym / yet
hath God shewed vs kindnes ynough for the which we ought to loue hym and so∣coure hym at all tymes. Let vs therfore lo¦ue hym for the loue that god his creatoure hath shewed vs / and beare his infirmitye yf he faule let vs lyfte him vp agayne / and endue hym with oure wysdom and all ou∣re workes / euen as Christ hath done with vs / and this is an euydent token that thou louest god / when thou louest thy brother / .i. Ioan .iiij. and seakest all meanes / to hel∣pe hym / these are the good workes that fo∣low fayth / and are euydent tokens that thy fayth is ryght and pure. Thus seest thou how good workes / flowe out of fayth tho¦row cherite. And cherite or loue is the ful∣fyllinge of the hole lawe. Roma .xiij. ¶Good workes. AMong good workes the chefe are: to be obedyent in all thinges vnto Kyn∣ges / Princes / Iudges / and soch other offy∣cers as farre as they cōmaunde ciuyle thin¦ges / that is to saye such thinges as are indif¦ferent / and not contrarye vnto the cōma∣undementes of god / for then must we ra∣ther obaye god then men / Actes in the fyfte chapter although we shuld lese both oure substaunce and lyffe therto: To honoure
rulers: to promote peace: to praye for all co¦minaltyes. And to applye all oure studyes to profyte them. The nexte are: to be obedyent vnto fa∣ther and mother: To prouide for oure hou¦scholde both nourishinge oure familie with bodelye sustenaunce / and also to enstruct them with the worde of God / and so to be their gouernoure carnall and spirituall. Then must we loke how we ought to be haue oure selfes towardes oure neyghbou¦res knowleginge that al the gyftes which are geuen vs of god / are not geuen vs for oure awne selfe but for the edefyinge of the congregacyon .i. Corin .xij. and yf we bestowe them not on that maner we shall surelye geue a rekenynge for then before the Lorde. Emonge these ought we to haue respect vnto the preachers and mynistres of the worde / that they maye be had in ho∣noure & well prouyded for. And aboue all thinges good brethren addresse youre sel∣ues vnto that necessarye worke prayer.

And let all men cast their peniwor∣thes before Luc .xiiij. And euerye daye that they are notvexed let them counte that wō¦ne / and loke euerye houre when the crosse shall come / for this is a playne case / God scourgeth euerye sonne whom he recea∣ueth.
