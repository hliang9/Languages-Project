ENGLANDS Tears and Lamentation For her lost Friend PEACE, AND Her comfort for the continuance of TRVTH: OR Truth and Peace justly pleaded for, and truly Petitioned for, by him that is neither Factious nor self-affected; but onely de∣sires the prosperity of his Country, and that Peace and the Gospel may be joyned together, without which we shall never expect to live in Unity. London, Printed for William Ley. 1642.
A Moderate Plea for Truth and Peace, or Truth and Peace reconciled. WEre I indewed with the demure and seraphi∣call patience of Solomon, or inriched with the glistering Rethorique of Aristotle, then might I hope to perswade this depraved di∣ssipated age, to lay aside there study of par∣ties to part all, and sweetly insinuate per∣swasive reasons, that might win the spirits of this irratio∣nall rage, seriously to lay their hands on their hearts, be∣fore the dayes come wherein we may all say we have no pleasure in them, and weigh in deepest Judgement the direfull judgements that begin to pain and pinch us all, and look upon them not only as the fruits of pernicious counsell and Counsellors, but the black web of all our weavings, the sad presages of Jerusalems, Germanies, Ire∣lands line drawing over England, let every one mend one, each party quarrell with their own persons, and every man look into his own bosome, and he shall there see and read the tokens of an angry God: England hath abused the height of sweetest and dearest mercies, and in stead of be∣ing alured and won to serve that God who hath been the Donor, Jesuram hath waxed fat and kicked, and in the middst of our mercies we have forgotten the God of our mercies, and therefore (as Chrisostome sadly and seriously) it is just with God, that we that would not remember our God nor our selves, should be plagued in forgetting both, and now Ephram is against Manasses and both against Judah, and most against God, O how happy should I think my self if I might write a word in due season, and all woud look on it as apples of gold in pictures of silver, that while some are earnest Proctors for a pernicious peace
without Christian tearms, in a word most neglect truth under pretended zeal for peace, and many are posessed with zeal without discretion, and the generall seek neither with christian moderation, Oh times! Oh manners! what strange times are we falen into, that none or few are found really to be fillii veritatis & alum in pacis, lovers of truth & peace: it is a Paradox in our age to love both, dreadfull must be our condition and bitternesse in the end, if there be found never a Moses that hath a fire of holy zeal, to re∣buke and correct the people for Idolatry, and a meek mind to pray and seek their peace. Is not every man that i wor∣thy the name of a Christian resolved into grief, to see the winters distemper of our age, which is such, that the love of many if not most is grown cold to truth and peace, truth much obscured, depraved, blemished, prejudic'd, undermined, discountenanc'd, surprised: peace very cra∣zie and sadly shaken, not only with rumors of wars and preparation for war, study of sides and parties to pierce us all, not only great diuision of thoughts, pertinacy in opi∣nions breeding disaffections, and now disaffections dread∣fully flaming into open contentions and hostilities, so far as from the strife of pens and tongues, writing and dispu∣ting, we are come to the terror of war, each party conten∣ding who shall obtain that—wofull self destroying, wch without God work wonders, will make none but death Victor I say, but let these tast but a little of the miseries of war, they would know it is there, as Socrates said it was in marriage, applying the similitude of the fishes, they that are without the net would fain be in, but they that are within would more fain be out, they that finding some discontent in peace called for war to ease them, would do as the old man did in the fable, who being heavy laden, threw his burden down and called for death to take him out of the world, but when death appeared ready to sa∣tisfie
his desire, to put it off, desired him to help him up with his burden, as though he had called him for no∣thing else. Oh blessed peace thou crownest thy yeere with thy goodnesse, and thy paths drop fatnesse, and blessed hast thou bin ô England, and our eyes might have been bles∣sed in beholding thee in the triumphs of peace, where we have seen plenty triumphing over famine in the country, riches triumphing over poverty in the Citie, learning tri∣umphing over ignorance in the University, Justice almost triumphing over vice in the Kingdon, and the King tri∣umphing over danger in the loyalty of his Subjects: these are the triumphs of peace; and the God of peace restore and continue this peace, that the fury of war may never turn this Paradise into a Wildernesse, nor make England which hath been a Map of Majestie to other Nations, a Map of confusion, and let us say, beati pacifici, after our Saviour, blessed are the peace-makers for they shall be called the Children of God, and let the blessing of our heavenly fa∣ther crowne His Majesties Royall head with gray hairs; the silver crown of age, let God create the fruits of the lips peace, let that pretious ointment which was richly shed upon the head of our high Priest Christ Jesus, de∣scend to the skirts of his cloathing, with an influence of like vertue, that as our Saviour healed the womans issue of blood, so he may stanch the bleeding wounds of Church and state, that hath put it self under his protection, and that his sacred Majesty may speedily decline all pernici∣ous counsells, and deliver into the hands of justice, all crafty Achitophells, that Prince and people may shout for joy, in seeing the nuptiall day of peace and truth, which hath as great a share in both as the former truth being the foundation, peace the lovely structure and building, the same Christ that said blessed are the peace-makers, with the
same blessed mouth said blessed are the pure in heart, which cannot be enjoyed without truth; though it be granted, which is as much as can be granted, that peace is the feli∣city of the Saints of heaven, the glory of the blessed An∣gells, the desire of nations, the royalty of God himself, yet let wise men consider, that without truth, these heights and the highest with reverence be it spoken, were but as sounding brasse and a tinckling Symboll; if peace be the felicity of the Saints, if truth were not in it would not it's beauty wither? it's silver become drosse, and it's gold tin? say it be the glory of Angells, were that glory worth the having, if this ingredient were not in it: & let the height of honor be set as a crown of incomparable gold, and preti∣ous stones on its head, and let men men believe it is the royalty of God himself, yet without this let us cover our faces in speaking being we are not: Truth is the most tran∣scendent glory of the devine Majesty, if we may say God is capable of degrees, all the glorious attributes of God receive there being from this, which if I speak as it is, is no lesse then God himself in his height of blessednesse, this truth is the increated light of the Intelectuall world, shining from God to Angels and men, and let mens hearts harp on this, that peace is the desire of nations, what is peace without Truth? not peace but the shadow of peace enjoyed without truth loved, is to use So∣lomons; phrase like a jewell of pearl in in a swines snoat, and let me speak and all England hear, had truth blessed truths fundamentalls at least bin holily and thankfully re∣ceived, peace had never departed, had truth been better welcome and more desieed by all, peace had never taken it's leave so suddenly and sadly, and the only way to have
peace restored in purity and perfection, is to purge our hearts, and then seek Gods peace, and if none this blood not of nation but of our nation purge us; then blessed shal we be that are in such a case, ye happy that have the Lord fully and reconciledly for our God, and then the other I say of truth and peace as the author of both in another case, those whom God hath joyned together let no man dare to put asunder, as men naturally incline to follow that Petition with ardency, Lord send peace in our dayes, so let them with as much fervency and sincerity, contend for that of Davids, that righteousnesse and peace may kisse each other, and let that heart, tongue and hand, sinck, pe∣rish, and wither, that will not say Amen. Truth and peace like a loving couple, they seek the pre∣servation of each others estate, and like Hypocrates twins they laugh together, and are like affected: survey their sweet congruity, and you will say as a lovely couple, it were sin and pitty to part them, truth and peace being bona publica & universalia,Docte Gau∣den in his sea∣sonable Ser∣m n before the truely Honor∣able Huose of Commons. truth for the soul, peace for the body and state, every one hath a share and interest in thē, Prince, Peers, and people: Behold with judicious eyes, and weigh with judgement the vanity, folly, misery, im∣possibility of reall injoyning one without the other, pon∣der, and ponder wisely, meekly, moderately, ruminate with serious and saddest thoughts on this, all ye that neg∣lect the fair opportunities of peace, and look upon it with a foolish disdain like a coy dame on a loving sutor, whom after she hath slighted and neglected, would upon second thoughts gladly imbrace with dearest affections when too late, but other guests will soon be invited, nay come ry∣ding on the wings of the wind; and peace will dwell with∣in our wals and plenteousnesse in our palaces, therefore let not any sons of Belial blow any longer the fire of con∣tention, and in seeking their own ends, endeavour to end
all. Let not the Prince wage war rashly, but remember the advise given to Augustus, to repeat all the letters of his Alphabet when he was angry before he do any thing, and our dread Soveraign should do well to try all his letes, all his learning, all his skill first, all his Counsell, before he ingage his Royall Person, loving and loyall Subjects, in an unnaturall war; and let him not proceed to war im∣placably; Hercules club they say was made of Olive, an embleme of peace, and peace must there be desired where war cannot be warranted, Oh that God would perswade his Royall heart not to go to war, but as An dronicus pro∣ceeded to the execution of justice with the saying of St. Paul, in his mouth and heart, non quod volo bonum facio, &c. the good I would I do not, and the evill I would not that do I, and resolve with our Saviour, if my right eye offend me and my people, I will pluck it out, and if my right hand offend justly, I will cut it off, better one or few I ac∣count dear should perish then the whole body be inevita∣bly lost, and let our right Honorable Parliament say as they have often, so God may be glorified, the King truly ho∣noured, Haman hanged, the people blessed in the injoy∣ment of truth and peace, let our honour lye in the dust, our estates wast, our pleasures and profits be known no more. And let all men pray for King and Parliament, and that those that God hath joyned together, those may be accurst that ere part asunder, and let none sinfully prefer an unwarrantable unjust peace, before a just war, least the just God teach them better divinity by the rod of severi∣ty; all know God justified Israels war, with his Brother Benjamine, and commanded warr with Amalech; Warr in it selfe is an appeale to heaven by a sword, when other wayes of Justice upon earth, either by witnesse, oathes, or Leagues are made voyd, and invallid; and Religion is a
greater happinesse then peace, Religion is just so much the best of blessings as God is the best of beings, a p;entifull table to feede the body without profitable discours to feede the minde, is little better then a manger, Israel had 3. crownes as Talmud observes, of the King, of the Priest, of the Law, but the crown of the Law was the chiefe of the three; in a word let peace and truth be in all mens lives and loves, truth as the roots, peace as the fruits, and ;et a;; desire nothing more then that the sonne of GOD may raigne, and that with and under the sonne of GOD the King may command, and we as good subjects to the Christ and the King, may obay, so prayes he that loves truth and peace. FINIS.
