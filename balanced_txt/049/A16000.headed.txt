¶ The prophete Ionas / with an introducciō before teachin¦ge to vnderstōde him and the right vse al∣so of all the scripture / and why it was writ¦ten / and what is therin to be sought / and shewenge wherewith the scripture is loc∣ked vpp that he which readeth it / can not vnderstōde it / though he studie therin ne∣uer so moch: and agayne with what keyes it is so opened / that the reader can be stopped out with no sotilte or fal∣se doctrine of man / from the true sense and vnder∣stondynge ther∣of.
W. T. vn to the Christen reader. AS ye ēvious Philistenes stop∣ped ye wesses of Abraham ād filled them vpp with erth / t put ye memoriall out of mīde / to ye entent yt they might cha∣lenge y• grounde: even so the fleshly mīded ypocrites stoppe vpp the vaynes of life w∣hich are in y• scripture / wt the erth of theyr tradiciōs / false similitudes & lienge allego∣ries: & y• of like zele / to make y• scripture th∣eyr awne possessiō & marchaundice: and so shutt vpp the kingdome of heven which is Gods worde nether enterīge in thē selues nor soferinge them that wolde. ¶ The scripture hath a body with out / ād within a soule / sprite & life. It hath wt out a barke / a shell ād as it were an hard bone for y• fleshly mynded to gnaw vppon. And within it hath pith / cornell / mary & all sw∣etnesse for Gods electe which he hath cho¦sen to geve them his spirite / & to write his law & y• faith of his sonne in their hertes. ¶ The scripture cōteyneth. iij. thīges in it first y• law to cōdemne all flesh: secōdaryly y• Gospell / yt is to saye / promises of mercie
for all yt repent & knowlege their sinnes at the preachīge of ye law & cōsent in their her¦tes that the law is good / & submitte them¦selues to be scolers to lern to kepe the lawe & to lerne to beleue y• mercie that is promi∣sed thē: & thridly the stories & liues of those scolars / both what chaunces fortuned thē / & also by what meanes their scolemaster t∣aught thē and made them perfecte / & how he tried the true from the false. ¶ When ye ypocrites come to y• lawe / they put gloses to ād make no moare of it then of a worldly law which is satisfied with y• outwarde worke and which a turke maye also fulfill. Whē yet Gods law never cea∣seth to cōdemne a man vntill it be written in his herte and vntill he kepe it naturally without cōpulsion & all other respecte saue only of pure love to God and his neybou∣re / as he naturally eateth whē he is an ho∣ngred / without cōpulsiō & all other respec∣te / saue to slake his hongre only. ¶ And whē they come to the Gospell / the∣re they mīgle their leuen & saye / God now receaueth vs no moare to mercie / but of
mercie receaueth vs to penaunce / that is to wete / holy dedes yt make them fatt belies & vs their captiues / both in soule and body. And yet they fayne theyr Idole y• Pope so mercifull / yt if thou make a litle money gli∣ster in his Balams eyes / there is nether pe¦naunce ner purgatory ner any fastīge at all but to fle to heven as sweste as a thought and at the twinkellynge of an eye. ¶ And the liues stories and gestes of men which are cōtayned in the bible / they reade as thīges no moare perteynīge vn to thē / then a take of Robī hode / & as thīges they wott not wherto they ferue / saue to fayne false discāt & tuglinge allegories / to stablish their kingdome with all. And one y• chefest & fleshliest studie they have / is to magnifie y• sayntes aboue measure & aboue y• trueth & with their poetrie to make them greater then euer God make them. And if they fix de any infirmite or synne asscribed vn to y• saintes / that they excuse with all diligēce / diminushīge the glorie of ye mercie of God & robbinge wretched sinners of all theyr cō fo: te / & thinke therby to flater the sayntes
and to obtayne their fauoure & to make spe¦ciall aduocates of thē: even as a man wold obtayne y• fauoure of wordely tirantes: as they also fayne the saintes moch moare cr∣uell then ever was any heathē man & moa¦re wrekefull and vengeable then y• poetes faine their godes or their furies yt torment y• soules in hell / if theyr euēs be not fasted & their images vifited & saluted wyth a Pa∣ter noster (whych prayer only oure lippes be accoynted with oure hertes vnderstōdin¦ge none at all) and worsheped wt a candell & y• offerīge of oure deuociō / in y• place whi∣ch thei haue chosen to heare y• supplicaciōs & meke peticiōs of their clientes therin. ¶ But thou reader thīke of ye law of God how yt it is all together spirituall / & so spiri¦tuall yt it is neuer fulfilled wt dedes or wer¦kes / vntill they flow out of thyne herte wt as greate loue toward thy neyboure / for no deleruīge of his ye though he be thine eni∣mie / as Christ loued y• ād did for the / for no desertīge of thyne / but evē whē thou wast his enimie. And in ye meane time / thoroute all our infancie & childhod in Christ / tyll
we e growen vpp in to perfecte men in the full knowlege of christ & full loue of christ agayne & of oure neyboures for his sake / af¦ter y• ensample of his loue to vs / remenbir that y• fulfillynge of y• law is / a fastfayth in christes bloud coupled wt our professiō & submyttīge ourselues to lerne to doo better ¶ And of y• Gospell or promises which th∣ou metest in y• scripture / beleue fast y• God will fulfill them vn to y• / and that vn to y• vttemost ott / at the repentaunce of thyne herte / whē thou turnest to hym & forsakest euell / even of his goodnesse & fatherly mer∣tie vn to the / ād not for thy flatterlge hym with ypocritish workes of thyne awne fay¦ninge. So yt a fast faith only with out res∣pecte of all workes / is the forgeuenesse both of the synne which we did in tyme of igno∣raunce with luste ād cōsent to synne / & also of all the synne which we doo by chaunce & of frailte / after yt we are come to knowlege ād have professed y• law out of oure hertes. And all dedes serue only for to helpe oure neyboures & to tame oure flesh that we fall not to synne agayne / & to exercice oure sou∣les
in vertue / & not to make satisfaction to God ward for ye synne yt is once paste. ¶ And all other stories of ye bible / with out excepciō / are y• practisinge of ye law & of the Gospell / and are true and faitfull ensam∣ples & sure erneste yt God will euen so deale with vs / as he did with thē / in all infirmi¦ties / in all temptaciōs / & in all like cases & chaunces. Wherin ye se on ye one syde / how fatherly & tendirly & with all cōpassion god entreateth his electe which submitte them selues as scolers / to lerne to walke in the wayes of his lawes / & to kepe thē of loue. If they forgatt thē selues at a time & wēt astraye / he sought thē out & fett thē agay∣ne with all mercie. If they fell & hurte thē selues / he healed thē agayne with all com¦passion & tendernesse of hert. He hath ofte brought greate tribulation & aduersite vp∣pon his electe: but all of fatherly loue onlye to teach thē & to make them se their awne hertes & ye sinne yt there laye hid / that they might aftirwarde feale his mercie. For his mercie wayted vppon thē / to rid them out agayne / assone as they ware lerned & come
to y• knowlege of their awne hertes: so that he neuer cast man awaye how depe so euer he had sinned / saue thē ōly which had first cast y• yocke of his lawes frō their neckes / with vtter diffiaunce & malice of herte. Which ensamples how cōfortable are they for vs / whē webe fallen in to sinne & God is come vppō vs with a storge / y• we dispe∣are not / but repēt with full hope of mercie after y• ensamples of mercie yt are gone befo¦re? And therfore they were written for our lernīge / as testifieth Paul Ro. xv. to cōfor¦te vs / y• we might y• better put oure hope & trust in God / whē we se / how mercifull he hath bene in tymes past vn to our weake brethern y• are gone before / in all theyr ad∣uersities / neade / temptaciōs / ye & horrible synnes in to which they now & then fell. ¶ And on y• other side ye se how they y• har¦dened their hertes & synned of malice & re∣fused mercie y• was offered thē & had no po¦wer to repēt / perished at y• later ende with all confusion & shame mercilessely. Which ensamples are very good & necessary / to ke¦pe vs in awe & dreade in tyme of prosperite
as thou maist se by Paul. j. Cor. x. that we abyde in the feare of God / & way not wild and fall to vanities ād so synne ād prouoke God and bringe wrath vppon vs. ¶ And thridly ye se in that practise / how as god is mercifull & longesoferynge / euen so were all his true prophetes & prechers / beringe the infirmities of their weake bre∣thern & their awne wrōges & iniuries with all paciēce & longesoferinge / neuer castinge any of thē of their backes / vn tyll they syn¦ned agenst y• holygost / maliciously persecu¦tinge y• open & manifest trouch: cōtrary vn¦to the ensample of y• Pope / which in sinnin¦ge agenst God & to quench y• trueth of his holy spirite / is euer chefe captayne and trō¦petblower / to sett other awerke / ād seketh only his awne fredome / liberte / priuilege / welth / prosperite / profite / pleasure / pasty∣me / honoure & glorie / with y• bondage / thr∣aldome / captiuite / miserie / wretchednesse & vile subiectiō of his brethern: & in his awne cause is so feruent / so steffe & cruell / that he will not sofre one word spoken agenst his false magiste / wily inuenciōs ād iuglynge
ypocrisie to be vnaduēged / though all chri¦stendome shuld be sett to gether by the ca∣res / and shuld cost he cared not how many hundred thousande their lives. Ow y• thou mayst reade Jonas frute fully & not as a poetis fable / but as an obligacō betwene God and thy soule / as an ernist peny geuen y• of God / yt he wil helpe y• in time of nede / if thou turne to him ād as the word of god y• only fode ād life of thy soule / this marke & note. First count Jonas the frend of god ād a man chosen of god to testifie his name vnto y• worlde: but yet a younge scolar / weake & rude / after y• faciō of y• appostles / while Christ was yet with them bodyly. Which though Christ taught thē euer to be meke & to vmble thē selues / yet oft stroue amonge them selues who shuld be greatest. The sonnes of Ze¦bede wold sitt / the one on the right hōde of Christ ād the other on y• lifte. They wold praye / that fire might descēde from heuen / and consume the Samaritanes. ¶ Whē Christ axed who saye men that I am / Peter answered / thou arte the sonne
of the lyuinge God / as though Peter had bene as perfecte as an angell. But imme∣diatly after / when Christ preached vnto thē of his deeth & passiō / Peter was angre & rebuked Christe & thought ernestly yt he had raued & not wist what he sayde: as at another time / when Christ was so feruēt∣ly busied in healinge y• people / yt he had no leyser to eate / they went out to holde him / supposinge that he had bene besyde him sel¦fe. Ande one yt cast out deuels in Christes name / they forbade / because he wayted not on them / so glorious were they yet. ¶ And though christ taughte all waye to forgeue / yet peter after longe goenge to sco¦le / axed wether men shuld forgeue. vij. ty∣mes / thynkinge yt. viij. tymes had bene to moch. And at y• last soper Peter wold have died with christe / but yet within fewe how∣res after / he denied hym / both cowardly & shamefully. And after y• same maner / tho∣ugh he had so lōge herd that nomā might auenge him selfe / but rather turne y• other cheke to / then to sinyte agayne / yet when Christ was in takīge / peter axed whether
it were lawfull to smyte with y• swerde / ād taried none answere / but layed on rashly. So that though when we come first vnto y• knowlege of the trueth / and the peace is made betwene God & vs / & we loue his la∣wes & beleue & trust in hym / as in oure fa∣ther & haue good hertes vnto him & be born anew in y• sprite: yet we are but childern ād younge scolars weake & foble & must have leysar to grow in y• spirite / in knowlege / lo¦ue & in y• dedes therof / as younge childern must have tyme to grow in their bodies. ¶ And God oure father & seolemaster fe∣deth vs & teached vs accordinge vnto the capacite of oure stomakes / & maketh vs to grow & waxe perfecte / & fineth vs & trieth vs as gold / in y• fire of temptaciōs & tribu¦lations. As Moses wittneseth Deutero. viij. sayēge: Remēber all y• waye by which y• lord thy God caried y• this. xl. yeres in y• wildernesse / to vmble the & to tēpte or pro¦ue the / y• it might be knowen what were in thine hert. He brougt the in to aduersite & made y• an hongred / & then feed y• with mā which nether thou ner yet thi fathers euer
knew of / to teach y• that a mā liueth no thy bred only / but by all that proceadeth out of the mouth of God. For y• promises of god are life vnto all y• cleaue vnto thē / moch moare thē is bred & bodyly sustinaunce: a y• iourney of y• children of Israel out of egy¦pte in to y• londe promised them / ministreth the notable ensamples & yt aboundātly / a doeth all y• rest of the bible also. How be it / it is impossible for flesh to beleue & to trust in y• trueth of gods promises / vntyll he ha¦ue lerned it in moch tribulacion / after that God hath deliuered hī out therof agayne. ¶ God therfore to teach Jonas & to shew him his awne hert & to make him perfecte & to enstructe vs also bi his ensample / sen him out of y• lande of Israel where he was a prophete / to goo amonge y• heathē people & to y• greatest & mightiest citie of y• world thē / called Niniue: to preache yt within. xl. dayes they shuld all perish for their sinnes & that y• citie shuld be ouerthrowē. Which message y• frewil of Jonas had as moch po¦wer to doo / as the weakest herted womāin the world hath power / if she were cōmaun
ded / to leppe in to a tobbe of lyuinge snakes & edders: as happely if God had cōmaun∣ded Sara to haue sacrificed hir sonne Isa∣ac / as he did Abrahā / she wold haue dispu∣ted with hī yer she had done it / or though she were sirōge ynough / yet many an holy seint coud not haue sound in their hertes / but wold haue disobeyed ād haue runne a∣waye frō y• presens of yt cōmaūdemēt of god wt Jonas if thei had bene so sirōgly tēpted. ¶ For Jonas thought of this maner: loo / I am here a prophete vnto Gods people the Israelites. Which though they haue gods word testified vnto them dayly / yet dispite it & worshepe God vnder y• likenesse of cal¦ues & after all maner facions saue after his awne worde / & therfore are of all naciōs y• worst & most worthy of punishment. And yet god for loue of few yt are amonge them & for his names sake spareth them & defer deth them. How thē shuld god take so cru∣ell vengeaunce on so greate a multitude of them to whome his name was neuer prea∣ched to ād therfore are not y• tenth parte so euel as these? If I shal therfore goo preach
so shall I lye & shame my selfe & God the to and make them the moare to dispice god and sett the lesse by him ād to be the moar cruell vn to his people. ¶ And vppon that imaginaciō he fled frō the face or presens of God: that is / out of y• contre where God was worsheped in & frō prosecutynge of Gods cōmaundemēt / and thought / I wyll gett me a nother waye a∣monge y• hethen people & be no moare a pro¦phete / but lyue at rest & out of all cōbraun∣ce. Neuer y• lesse the god of all mercie which careth for his electe childern & turneth al vn to good to them & smiteth thē to heale them agayne & killeth thē to make thē al¦ue agayne / & playeth with thē (as a father doth some tyme with his yoūge ignoraunt childern) & tempteth them & proueth them to make them se theyr awne hertes / proui∣ded for onas / how all thinge shuld be. ¶ When Jonas was entered in to the shep∣pe / he layed him downe to slepe ād to take his rest: that is / his cōscience was tossed be∣twene the cōmaudemēt of God which sent him to Niniue / & his fleshly wisdome that
dissuaded & counseled hym ye cōtrary & at ye last preualed agēst ye cōmaundemēt & cari∣ed hym a nother waye / as a sheppe caught betwene. ij. streames / & as poetes faine the mother of Meliager to be betwene diuers affecciōs / while to aduēge hir brothers de∣eth / she sought to sle hir awne sonne. Whe¦re vppon for very payne & tediousnesse / he laye downe to slepe / for to put ye cōmaunde¦ment which so gnew & freate his cōscience / out of minde / as y• nature of all weked is / whē they haue sinned a good / to seke al m∣eanes with riot / reuell & pastyme / to driue ye remenbraunce of synne out of their thou∣ghtes or as Adā did / to couer their naked∣nesse with aporns of pope holy workes▪ But God awoke hym out of his dreame / and sett his synnes before his face. ¶ For when y• Lott had caught Jonas / thē be sure yt his synnes came to remēbraunce agayne & that his conscience raged no lesse thē ye waues of the se. And thē he thought that he only was a sinner & ye hethen that ware in ye shepp none in respecte of him / o thought also / as veryly as he was fled frō
god / that as verily god had cast hi awaye▪ for y• sight of y• rod mal eth y• natural child not ōly to se & to knowlege his faulte / but also to forgett all his fathers olde mercie & kindnesse. And then he cōfessed his synne openly & had yet seuer perish alone thē y• y• other shuld haue perished with him for his sake: and so of very desperacion to haue li∣ued any lenger / bad cast him in to y• see be∣tymes / excepte they wold be lost also. ¶ To speake of lottes / how ferforth they are lawfull / is a light questiō. First to vse thē for the breakinge of strife / as when par¦tenars / their goodes as equally diuided as they cā / take euery mā his parte by lott / to avoyde all suspiciō of disceytfulnesse: & as y• appostles in y• first of y• Actes / whē they sought a nother to succede Iudas the tray∣toure / &. ij. persones were presentes / thē to breake strife & to satisfie al parties / did cast lottes / wheter shuld be admitted / desiryn¦ge god to eper thē & to take whō he knew most mete / seynge they wist not wheter to preferre / or haply coude not all agre on et∣her / is lawfull ad in all like cases. But to
abuse them vn to y• tempiinge of God & to cōpell him therwith to vtter thinges whe∣rof we stōd in doute / when we haue no com¦maundemēt of him so to do / as these hethē here dyd / though God turned it vn to his glorie / can not be but euell. ¶ The hethen sepinē asstonied at y• sight of y• miracle / feared God / prayed to him / of¦fered sacrifice & vowed vowes. And I dou∣te not / but that some of thē or haply all ca∣me therby vn to the true knowlege & true worshepinge of God & ware wōne to God in theyr soules. And th{us} God which is in∣finite mercifull in all his wayes / wrought their soules health out of y• infirmite of Io¦nas / euen of his good will & purpose & loue wherewith he loued them before the world was made / & not of chaunce / as it appereth vn to the eyes of the ignoraunt. ¶ And that Jonas was .iij. dayes & .iij. ni∣ghtes in the bely of his fish: we cā not ther by proue vn to te Iewes & īfideles or vn to any man / y• Christ must therfore dye ād be buried & rise agayne. But we vse y• ensam∣ple ād likenesse to strength the saith of the
weake. For he that beleaueth the one can¦not doute in y• other: in as moch as the hād of God was no lesse mightie in preseruige Jonas aliue agenst all naturall possibilite & in deliuerynge hi safe out of his fish / thē in reysynge vpp Christ agayne out of his sepulchre. And wemaye describe y• power & vertue of y• resurrecciō therby / ac Christ hī selfe boroweth y• similitud̄e therto Mat. xij. sayēge vn to y• Jewes that came abou∣te him & desyred a signe or a wōder frō he∣uen to certifye thē that he was christ: this euell & wed lockebreakīge naciō (which bre∣ake y• wedlocke of faith wherwith they be▪ maried vn to God / ād beleue in their false workes) seke a signe / but there shal no sig∣ne be geuen thē saue ye signe of the Prophe∣te Jonas. For as Jonas was. iij. dayes ād iij. nightes in the bely of the whale / euē so shall the sonne of man be. iij. dayes &. iij. ny¦ghtes in the herte of the erth. Which was a watch word / as we saye / & a sharpe thre∣ateninge vn to y• Jewes & as moch to saye as thus / ye harde herted Jewes seke a sig∣ne: loo / thys shalbe youre sygne / as Jonas
was reysed out of the sepulchre of his fishe & then sent vn to the Niniuites to preach y• they shuld perish / euen so shall I ryse agay¦ne out of my sepulchre & come & preach re∣pentaunce vn to you. Se therfore when ye se y• signe that ye repēt or else ye sha suerly perish & not escape. For though the infirmi¦ties which ye now se i my flesh be a lett vn to youre faythes / ye shall yet then be with out excuse / when ye se so greate a miracle & so greate power of god shed out vppō you. And so Christe came agayne after y• resur∣recciō / in his spirite & preached repētaunce vn to them / by the mouth of his appostles & disciples / & with miracles of y• holy gost. And all that repented not perished shortly after ād were for y• most parte slayne with swerde ād y• rest caried awaye captiue in to all quarters of the world for an ensample / as ye se vn to this daye. ¶ And in lyke maner sens the world be∣ganne / where soeuer repentaunce was of∣fered and not receaued / there God toke cr∣uell vengeaunce immiediatly: as ye se in y• loud of No / in the ouerthrowēge of Sodō
& Gomor & all the contre aboute: & as ye se of Egipte / of the Amorites / Cananites & afterwarde of the very Israelites / & then at the last of the Jewes to / ād of the Assy∣riens and Babysoniens and so thorout all the imperes of the world. ¶ Gyldas preached repētaunce vn to y• o de Britaynes that inhabited englōd: they repented not / & therfore God sent in theyr enimies vppō thē on euery side & destroyed thē vpp & gaue the lōd vn to other naciōs And greate vengeaunce hath bene takē in that lande for synne sens that tyme. ¶ Wicleffe preached repētaunce vn to ou∣re fathers not longe sens: they repēted not for their hertes were indurat & theyr eyes blinded with their awne Pope holy right∣wesnesse wherwith they had made theyr soules gaye agenst the receauinge agayn of y• woked spirite that bringeth. vij. worse then hym selfe with him & maketh y• late  ende worse then the beginninge: for in open sinnes there is hope of repentaunce / but in holy ypocrisie none at all. But what folo∣wed? they slew their true & right kinge ād
sett vpp▪ iij. wrōge kīges arow / vnder wh∣ich all the noble bloud was slayne vpp ād halfe the coniēs therto / what in fraunce & what with their awne swerde / in fightīge amonge thē selues for y• crowne / & y• cities and townes decayed and the land brought halfe in to a wyldernesse in respecte of that it was before. ¶ And now Christ to preach repētaunce / is resen yet ōce agayne out of his sepulchre in which the pope had buried him and kep∣te him downe with his pilars and polaxes and all disgysinges of ypocrisie / with gyle / wifes and falshed / ād with the swerd of al princes which he had blynded with his fal¦se marchaundice. And as I dowte not of y• ensamples that are past / so am I sure that greate wrath will folow / excepte repētaun¦ce turne it Backe agayne and cease it. ¶ When Jonas had bene in te fishes bely a space & the rage of his conscience was so∣mewhat quieted ād swaged and he come to him selfe agayne and had receaued a lytle hope / the qualmes & panges of desperaciō which went ouer hys hert / halfe ouerco∣me
he prayed / as he maketh menciōin the texte sayēge: Jonas prayed vn to the lord his god out of the bely of the fishe. But the wordes of that prayer are not here sett. The prayer y• here stonde th in the texte / is the prayer of prayse & thākesgeuēge which he prayed and wrote when he was escaped and past all ieopardie. ¶ In the end of which prayer he sayth / I will sacrifice with the voyce of thankesge∣uenge and paye that I haue vowed / that sauinge cometh of the lorde. For verely to cōfesse out of the herte / that all benefites co¦me of God / euen out of the goodnesse of his mercie and not deseruinge of oure dedes / is the only sacrifice that pleaseth God. And to beleue that god only is the sauer / is the thynge that all the Jewes vowed in theyr circumcision / as we in oure baptim. Which vowe Jonas now tawght with experiēce / promiseth to paye. For those outwarde sa∣crifices of bestes / vn to which Jonas had haply asscribed to moch before / were but fe¦ble & childish thinges & not ordeyned / that the workes of thē selues shuld be a seruice
vnto god / but vn to the people / to put thē in remembraunce of this inwarde sacrifice of thankes & of faith to trust and beleue in God the only sauer. Which significacion when was awaye / they were abhomina∣ble and deuellysh ydolatrye and imageser∣uice: as oure ceremonies and sacramentes are become now to all that trust & beleue in the werke of them and ar not taught the significacions / to edifye theyr soules with knowlege and the doctrine of God. ¶ When Jonas was cast vppō lond agay¦ne / then his will was fre ād had power to goo whother God sent him & to doo what God bade / his awne imaginacions layed a parte. For he had bene at a new scole / ye ād in a fornace where he was purged of moch refuse & droshe of fleshly wisdome / which resisted y• wisdome of god & led Jonases wil cōtrary vn to y• will of god. For as ferre as we be blynd in Adam / we can not but seke & will oure awne profitt / pleasure & glorie. And as ferre as we be taughte in the spri∣te / we can not but seke & wyll the pleasure and glorie of God only.
¶ And as for the. iij. dayes iourney of Nini¦ue / whether it were in length or to goo rou∣nde aboute it or thorow all the stretes / I cō¦mitte vn to the discreciō of other men. But I thinke that it was then the greatest citie of the world. ¶ And that Jonas wēt a dayes iourney in the citie / I suppose he did it not in one daye: but wēt fayre & easyly preachīge here a ser¦mon & there a nother & rebuked the synne of the people for which they must perishe. ¶ And when thou art come vn to the repē∣taunce of the Niniuites / there hast thou su∣re ernest / that how soeuer angre god be / yet he remembreth mercie vn to all that truly repent and beleue in mercie. Which ensam¦ple oure sauioure Christ also casteth in the teeth of the indurat Jewes sayenge: the Ni¦niuites shall rise in iudgemēt with this na¦cion and condemne them / for they repented at the preachynge of Jonas / and beholde a greater thē Jonas here / meanynge of hym selfe. At whose preachinge yet / though it were neuer so mightie to perce the herte / & for all his miracles therto / the hard herted
Jewes coude not repent: when the heathen Niniuites repented at the bare preachynge of Jonas rebukinge theyr synnes with out any miracle at all. ¶ Why? For y• Jewes had leuēded the spi¦rituall law of God and with theyr gloses had made it all to gether erthie ād fleshly / and so had sett a vayle or coueringe on Mo¦ses face / to shodowe and darken y• glorious brightnesse of his contenaunce. It was syn¦ne to stele: but to robbe wedowes howses vnder a coloure of longe prayēge / & to pol∣le in the name of offeringes / and to snare y• people with intollerable cōstitucions agēst all loue / to ketch theyr money out of theyr purses / was no synne at all. ¶ To smyte father ād mother was synn: But to withdraw helpe frō them at theyr nede / for blynde zele of offeringe / vn to the profytt of the holy phareses / was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kyn∣ne chose wheter they will synke or sweme / while thou byldest and makest goodly fun¦daciōs for holy people which thou hast cho¦sen to be thy christe / for to sowple thy soule
with the oyle of theyr swete blessynges / & to be thy Jesus for to saue thy soule from y• purgatory of the bloud that only purgeth synne / with theyr watchīge / fastīge / wol∣ward goinge & rysynge at mydnyght etc. where wyth yet they purge not them sel∣ues from theyr couetousnesse / pryde / lechu∣ry or any vyce that thou seyst amonge the laye people. ¶ It was greate synne for Christ to hea∣le the people on the sabboth daye vn to the glorie of God hys father / but none at all for them to helpe theyr catell vnto theyr awne profett. ¶ It was synne to eate wyth vnwashen handes or on an vnwashen table / or out of an vnwashen dish: but to eate out of that purifyed dysh that which came of brybery / theft & extorsion / was no synne at all. ¶ It was exceadynge meritorious to ma∣ke many dyscyples: But to teach them to feare God in hys ordynaunces / had they no care at all. ¶ The hye prelates so defended the ryght of holy church ād so feared the people with
the curse of God & terreble paynes of hell / that no man durst leaue the vilest herke in hys gardeyne vntythed. And the offeryn∣ge and thynges dedycat vn to God for the profitt of hys holy vycars where in soch estymacion and reuerēce / that it was moch greater synne to sweare truly by them / thē to for swere thy selfe by God: what venge∣aunce then of God / and how terreble and cruell damnacion thynke ye preached they to fall on thē that had stolen soch holy thī∣ges? And yet sayth Christ / that ryght∣wesnesse ād faith in kepynge promise / mer∣cie and indyfferent iudgement were vttur∣ly troden vnder fote and cleane dispysed of those blessed fathers / whych so mightely mayntened Arons patrimony ād had mad it so prosperous ād enuironed it and walled it aboute on euery syde with y• feare of god / that noman durst twech it. ¶ It was greate holynesse to garnysh y• se pulchres of y• prophetes & to cōdemne their awne fathers for sleynge of them: and yet were they thē selues for blinde zele of their owne cōstituciōs / as ready as their fathers
to sle whosoeuer testified vn to them / the same trueth which the prophetes testified vn to theyr fathers. So that Christ cōpa¦reth all the rightwesnesse of those holy pa∣triarkes vn to the out warde bewtye of a paynted sepulchre full of stench and all vn¦clennesse wythyn. ¶ And finally to begyld a mans neyboure in sotle bargeninge and to wrappe and cō∣pase him in with cauteles of the law / was then as it is now in the kingdome of y• Po∣pe. By the reason where of they excluded the law of loue out of theyr hertes / ād cōse quētly all true repentaunce: for how coude they repēt of y• they coude not se to be sinne? ¶ And on the other syde they had sett vpp a rightwesnesse of holy workes / to clense theyr soules with all: as the Pope sanctifi∣eth vs with holy oyle / holy bred / holy salt / holy candels / holy dome ceremonies ād ho¦ly dome blessynges / and with what soever holynesse thou wilt saue with the holynes of▪ Gods worde which only speaketh vn to the herte and sheweth the soule hir fithy∣nese and vnclennesse of synne / and leadeth
hir by y• waye of repentaunce vn to y• foun∣tayne of Christes bloude to washe it aw∣aye thorow faith. By the reason of which false rightwesnesse they were dysobedient vn to the rightwesnesse of God / which is the forgeuenesse of synne in Christes blou¦de and coude not beleue it. And so thorow fleshly interpretynge the law ād false ima¦gined rightwesnesse / their hertes were har¦dened ād made as stony as clay in an hote surnace of fire / that they coude receaue ne∣ther repentaunce ner faith or any moyster of grace at all. ¶ But the hethen Niniuites / though they were blynded with lustes a good / yet were in those. ij. poyntes vncorrupte and vnhar¦dened / & therfore with the only preachinge of Jonas came vn to the knowlege of their synnes and confessed them & repented tru∣ly & turned euery man from his euelldedes & declared theyr sorow of hert & true repen¦taunce / with theyr dedes which they dyd out of faith & hope of forgeuenesse / chasty∣singe their bodies with prayer & fastinge & with takinge all pleasures from the flesh:
trustynge / as god was angre for their wer kednesse / even so shuld he forgeue them o hys mercye / yf they repēted & forsoke their mysse fyuinge. ¶ And in the last ende of all / thou hast yet a goodly ensample of lernynge / to se how erth ye Jonas is styll for all hys tryenge in the whales bely. He was so sore displeased because the Niniuites perished not / that he was wery of hys lyfe and wished after the deeth for very sorow & payne / that he had loost the glorie of his prophesienge / in that his prophesie come not to passe. But god re¦buked him with a likenesse sayenge: it gre∣ueth thyne hert for the losse of a vile shrob be or spraye / wheron thou bestoweddest no loboure or cost / nether was it thyne hand∣werke. How moch moare then shuld greue myne herte / the losse of so greate a multitu¦de of innocētes as are in Niniue / which are all myne handes werke. Nay Jonas / Jam God ouer all / and father as well vn to the hethen as vn to the Jewes ād mercifull to all and warne yer I smyte: nether threte I so cruelly by any prophete / but that I wyll
forgeue yf they repent ād ax mercie: nether on the other syde / what soeuer I promyse / wyll I fulfyll it / saue for theyr sakes only whych trust in me and submitte them sel∣ues to kepe my lawes of very loue / as na∣turall chyldern. ON thys maner to read y• scripture is y• right vse therof & why y• holy gost caused it to be writtē. That is yt thou first seke out y• law / what god will haue the to doo / interpretinge it spiritually with cut glose or coueringe the brightnesse of Moses face / so yt thou fele in thyne hert / how that it is damnable synne before god / not to loue they neyboure that is thyne eni¦mie / as puerly as Christ loued the / and y• not to loue thy neyboure in thyne herte / is to haue cōmitted all ready all synne agenst him. And therfore vn tyll that loue beco∣me / thou must knowlege vnfaynedly that there is synne in the best dede thou doest. And it must ernestly greue thyne hert and thou must washe all thy good dedes in chri¦stes bloude / yet they can be pure and an ac∣ceptable sacrifice vn to God / and must de∣sire
god y• father for his sake / to take thi de¦des a worth & to pardō y• imperfectenesse of them / & to geue the power to doo thē better and with moare feruent loue. ¶ And on the other syde thou must serch diligently for the promises of mercie which God hath promised the agayne. Which. ij. poyntes / that is to wete / y• lawe spiritual∣ly interpreted / how that all is dānable syn¦ne that is not vnfayned loue out of the gr∣ownde and botom of the herte after the en∣sample of Christes loue to vs / because we be all equally created ād formed of one god oure father / and indifferently bought & re∣demed with one bloud of oure sauioure Je∣sus Christe: ād that the promises be geuen vn to a repentynge soule that thursteth and longeth after them / of the pure and fa¦therly mercie of god thorow oure faith one¦ly with oute al deseruinge of oure dedes or merites of oure werkes / but for Christes sake alone and for the merites ād deseruin∣ges of his werkes / deth and passions that he sofered all together for vs & not for him¦selfe: whych. ij. poyntes I saye / if they be
written in thine herte / are the keyes which so open all the scripture vn to the / that no creature can locke the out / and with whi∣ch thou shalt goo in and out / and finde pa∣sture and fode euery where. And yf the∣se lesons be not writtten in thyne herte / then is all the scripture shutt vpp / as a cor¦nell in the shale / so that thou mayst read it and comen of it and reherse all the stories of it and dispute sotilly and be a profoun∣de sophister / and yet vnderstond not one Iot therof. ¶ And thridly that thou take the stories & liues which are cōteyned in the bible / for su¦re ād vndowted ensamples / yt God so will deale with vs vn to the worldes ende. ¶ Here with Reader farewell and be com∣mended vn to God / and vn to the grace of hys spryte. And first se that thou stoppe not thyne eares vn to the callynge of god / and that thou harden not thine herte begy¦led with fleshly interpretinge of the law & false imagined and ypocritish rightwesnes¦se / and so the Niniuites ryse with the at ye day of iudgement & condemne the.
¶ And secōdarily if thou finde ought amis¦se / when thou seyst thy selfe in the glasse of Gods worde / thynke it cōpendious wisdo∣me / to amende y• same betymes / moneshed & warned by the ensample of other men / ra¦ther thē to tary vntill thou be beten also. ¶ And thridly if it shall so chaunce / that y• wild lustes of thy flesh shall blynd the and carie the cleane awaye with them for a ty∣me: yet at the later ende / when y• god of all mercie shall haue compased the in on euery syde with tēptaciōs / tribulacions / aduersi∣ties & cōbraunce / to bringe y• home agayne vn to thyne awne herte / & to set thy sinnes wich thou woldest so fayne couer & put out of mynd with delectaciō of voluptuous pa¦stymes / before y• eyes of thy cōscience: then call y• faithfull ensample of Jonas & all ly∣lie stories vn to thy remēbraunce / ād with Jonas turne vn to thi father that smote y•: not to cast y• awaye / but to laye a corosie ād a eeatige playlier vn to y• pocke that laye o & fret inwarde / to draw y• disease out & so make it appere / y• thou mightest feale t∣y seckenes & y• daunger therof & come & re
leaue the healynge playster of mercie. ¶ And forget not yt what soeuer ensample of mercie god hath shewed sens y• beginnin¦ge of y• world / the same is promised the / yf thou wilt in like maner turne agayne and receaued it as they dyd. And with Jonas be a knowen of thy synne & cōfesse it & kno∣wlege it vn to thy father. ¶ And as y• law which freteth thy cōscien¦ce / is in thyne herte & is none outwarde thi¦ge / evē so seke within in thine herte / ye play¦ster of mercie / the promyses of forgeuenesse in oure sauioure Jesus Christe / accordinge vn to all the ensamples of mercie that are gonne before. ¶ And with Jonas let thē that wayte on vanities & seke god here & there & in euery tēple saue in their hertes goo / & seke thou y• testamēt of god in thyne hert. For in thyne hert is the worde of y• law / & in thyne hert is y• worde of fayth in the promises of mer∣cie in Jesus Christe. So that yf thou cōfes∣se with a repentynge herte & knowlege ād surely beleue yt Jesus is lorde ouer all syn∣ne / thou art saffe.
¶ And finally when the rage of thy cōsci∣ce  ceased and quieted with fast faith in the promises of mercie / then offer with Jo∣nas the offeringe of prayse and thankesge∣uinge / & paye the vow of thy baptim / that God only saueth / of his ōly mercie & good∣nesse: that is / beleue stedfastly & preach cō∣stantly that it is God only that smyteth / and God only that healeth: ascribynge y• cause of thy tribulation vn to thyne awne synne / and y• cause of thy deliueraunce vn to the mercie of God. ¶ And beware of the leuē y• saith we haue power in oure frewill before y• preachinge of y• Gospell / to deserue grace / to kepe y• law / of cōgruite / or god to be vnrightwesse. And fie with Jhon in the first / yt as y• law was geuē by Moses / euē so grace to fulfill it / is geuē by christe. And whē they saye oure de¦des with grace deserue heuen / sae thou wt Paule Ro. vj. y• euerlastīge life is the gifte of god thorow Jesus Christ oure lorde / & yt we be neade sonnes by faith Jhon. j. & ther∣fore heyres of god with christ Ro. viij. And says that we receaue al of god thorow faith
that foloweth repentaunce / & yt we doo not oure werkes vn to god / but ether vn to ou∣reselues / to fley y• sinne that remayneth in y• flesh & to waxe perfecte / ether vn to oure neyboures which doo as moch for vs agay¦ne in some other thīges. And whē a mā ex¦ceadeth in giftes of grace / let hī vnderstōde that they be geuē him / as wel for his wea∣ke brethern / as for him selfe: as though all the bred be cōmitted vn to the panter / yet for his felowes with hym / which geue the thankes vn to theyr forde / and recompen∣ce the panter agayne with other kynde ser¦uice in theyr offices. And when they saye that Christ hath made no satisfaccion for the synne we doo after oure baptym: saye thou wyth the doctrine of Paule / that in oure baptym we receaue the merytes of Christes deeth thorow repentaunce and fayth of which two / baptim is the sygne. And though when we synne of fraltie af∣ter oure baptym we receaue the sygne no moare / yet we be renewed agayne thorow repentaunce and faith in Christes bloude / whych twayne / the sygne of baptym ever
contynued amonge vs in baptisynge oure younge childern doeth euer kepe in mynde and call vs backe agayne vn to oure profes¦sion if we be gonne astraye / & promiseth vs forgeuenesse. Nether can actuall synne be washed awaye with oure werkes / but wi∣th Christes bloude: nether can there be any other sacrifice or satisfaccion to Godward for them / saue Christes bloude. For as moch as we can doo no werkes vnto God / but receaue only of his mercie with oure re¦pentynge fayth / thorow Jesus Christe ou∣re forde and only sauer: vn to whom & vn to God oure father thorow him / and vn to hys holy spirite / that only purgeth / sanctifieth & was∣heth vs in the innocēt bloude of oure re∣demption / be prayse for ever AMEN.
¶ The Storie of the prophete Jonas. The first Chapter. THe worde of the lorde came vn to the prophete Jonas ye sonne of Amithai sayenge: ryse & gett the to Niniue that greate citie & preach vn to thē / how that theyr wekednesse is come vpp before me. ¶ And Jonas made hi ready to fle to Th∣arsis frō the presens of y• lorde / & gatt hym downe to Joppe / and founde there a sheppe ready to goo to Tharsis / & payed his fare / & wēt aborde / to goo with them to Thar∣sis frō the presens of the lorde. ¶ But y• lorde hurled a greate winde in to y• se / so that there was a myghtie tēpest in these: in so moch yt the shepp was lyke to goo in peces. And the mariners were afra∣yed & cried euery man vn to his god / & cast out y• goodes yt were in ye sheppe in to y• se / to lighten it of thē. But Jonas gatt him vnder the hatches & layed him downe and lombrede. And y• master of the sheppe ca∣me to him & sayd vn to hī / why slomberest thou? vpp / & call vn to thy god / that God maye thinke on vs / that we perish not.
¶ And they sayde one to a nother / come & lett vs cast lottes / to know for whose cau∣se we are thus troublede. And they cast ot¦tes. And y• lott fell vppon Ionas. ¶ Thē they said vnto hī / tel vs for whose cause we are thus trowbled: what is thine occupaciō / whence comest thou / how is thy cōtre called / & of what nacion art thou? ¶ And he answered thē / I am an Ebrue: & the lord God of heuen which made both se and drie land / I feare. Then were the men exceadingly afrayd & sayd vn to him / why diddest thou so? For they knew that he w∣as fled from the presens of the lorde / becau¦se he had told them. ¶ Then they sayd vn to hym / what shall we doo vnto the / that these mayecease frō trowblinge vs? For these wrought & was trowblous. And he answered them / take me and cast me in to these / & so shall it lett you be in reste: for I wotte / it is for my sa∣ke / that this greate tempest is come oppon you. Neuerthelesse the men assayed wyth rowenge to bringe the sheppe to lande: but it wold not be / because these so wrought &
was so trowblous agenst them. Wherefo∣re they cried vn to the lorde & sayd: O lorde latt vs not perih for this mans deeth / ne∣ther laye innocēt bloud vn to oure charge: for thou lorde even as thy pleasure was / so thou hast done. ¶ And thē they toke Ionas / & cast hī in to y• se / & the se lefte ragynge. And ye men fea∣red the lorde excedingly: & sacrificed sacrifi∣fice vn to the lorde: and vowed vowes. ¶ The seconde Chapter. BUt y• lorde prepared a greate fyshe / to swalow vp Ionas. And so was Ionas in ye bowels of ye fish. iij. day∣es &. iij. nightes. And Ionas prayed vnto y• lord his god out of y• bowels of the fish. ¶ And he sayde: in my tribulacion I called vn to the lorde / and he answered me: out of the bely of hell I cried / ād thou herdest my voyce. For thou hadest cast me downe depe in the middes of the se: & the floud cōpased me aboute: and all thy waues & rowles of water wēt ouer me: & I thought y• I had be ne cast awaye out of thy sight. But I will yet agayne loke towarde thy holy temple.
The water cōpased me euē vn to the very soule of me: the depe laye aboute me: ād the wedes were wrappte aboude myne heed. And I wēt downe vn to the botome of the hylles / & was barred in with erth on euery syde for euer. And yet thou lorde my God broughtest vp my life agayne out of corru∣pcion. When my soule faynted in me / I th∣ought on the lorde: & my prayer came in vn to the / even in to thy holy temple. They yt obserue vayne vanities / haue forsakē him that was mercifull vn to them. But I wil sacrifice vn to the with the voce of thankes¦geuinge / & will paye that I have vowed / that sauinge cometh of the lorde. ¶ And the lorde spake vn to the fish: and it cast out Ionas agayne vppon ye drie lande. ¶ The. iij. Chapter. THen came the worde of the lorde vn to Ionas agayne sayenge: vpp / ād gett ye to Niniue that greate citie / & preache vn to thē the preachynge which I bade ye. And he arose & wēt to Niniue at ye lordes cōmaundmēt. Niniue was a greate citie vn to god / cōteynīge. iij. dayes iourney
¶ And Ionas went to & entred in to y• citie euen a dayes iourney / and cried sayenge: There shall not passe. xl. dayes but Nini∣ue shalbe ouerthrowen. ¶ And the people of Niniue be leued God / and proclaymed fasiynge / ād arayed them selues in sackeloth / as well the greate as the small of them. ¶ And y• tydinges came vn to the kinge of Niniue / which arose out of his sete / and did his apparell of & put on sackcloth / & sate hī downe in asshes. And it was cried ād com∣maunded in Niniue by y• auctorite of y• kin∣ge ād of his lordes sayenge: se that nether mā or beest / oxe or shepe tast ought at al / & that they nether fede or drinke water. ¶ And they put on sackcloth both man ād beest / & cried vn to God mightily / ād tur∣ned euery man from his weked waye / and frō doenge wrōge in which they were acu∣stomed / sayenge: who can tell whether god will turne & repent / & cease from his fearce wrathe / that we perish not? And when god saw theyr workes / how they turned from theyr weked wayes / he repented on ye euell
which he sayd he wold doo vn to them / ād dyd it not. ¶ The. iiij. Chapter. WHerfore Ionas was sore discontent ād angre. And he prayed vn to the lorde ād sayd: O lord / was not this my sayenge when I was yet in my contre? And therfore I hasted rather to fle to T∣harsis: for I knew well ynough that thou wast a mercifull god / ful of cōpassion / long yer thou be angre and of greate mercie and repentest when thou art come to take pu∣nishment. Now therfore take my life from me / for I had leuer dye then liue. And the lorde said vn to Ionas / art thou so angrie? ¶ And Ionas gate him out of the citie and sate him downe on the est syde theroffe / ād made him there a bothe ād sate thervnder in the shadowe / till he might se what shuld chaunce vn to the citie. ¶ And y• lorde prepared as it were a wild vine which sprāge vp ouer Ionas / that he might haue shadowe ouer his heed / to deli∣uer him out of his payne. And Ionas was exceadynge glad of the wild vine.
¶ And the lorde ordeyned a worme agenst the springe of y• morow mornīge which smo¦te the wild vine / that it wethered awaye. And assone as the sonne was vpp / God prepared a feruent cest winde: so that y• son¦ne bete ouer the heed of Jonas▪ that he fain¦ted agayne ād wished vn to hys soule that he might dye / and sayd / it is better for me to dye then to liue. ¶ And god sayd vn to Jonas / art thou so angre for thy wildvine? And he sayde / I am angrie a goode / even on to the deeth. And the lorde sayde / thou hast compassion on a wild vine / wheron thou bestoweddest no laboure ner madest it growe / which sp∣range vp in one night and perished in ano∣ther: and shuld not I haue compassion on Niniue that greate citie / wherin there is a multitude of people / euen aboue an hundred thousande that know not theyr right hand from the lyfte / besydes moch catell?
