A DECLARATION of the iust causes of his Ma∣iesties proceeding against those Mi∣nisters, who are now lying in prison, attainted of high treason. AS his Maiesties fa∣therly care hath euer bene so great towards his people and louing Subiects, as he hath not onely bene care∣full to gouerne them by iust and aequitable Lawes, but likewise hath euer had a speciall respect to the true and right information of their minds as touching all his publique Actions and proceedings: So for this pur∣pose he hath euer frō time to time by pub∣lique Declaration and Proclamation inter∣preted and explained to all his louing Sub∣iects his true intention and sinceritie of his meaning, that thereby his Subiects know∣ledge of his will, and of the grounds moo∣uing him thereunto, being ioyned to their
duetifull and naturall inclination of obedi∣ence, a reuerent loue together with a feare to offend, might bee continually encreased and nourished in their hearts, their obedi∣ence not proceeding of a naked feare, but from a feare mixed and strengthened with loue for good reasons, and founded vpon a good conscience and cleare knowledge of the trueth. And as this his Maiesties fatherly care hath euer since his maioritie of yeeres most clearely appeared in all the points of his Highnesse gouernment in this his king∣dome of Scotland: So now vpon that late occasion of the Rebellious and traiterous misbehauiour of some particular Ministers within this Kingdome, his Maiestie conti∣nuing his former louing custome towards his Subiects, hath thought conuenient to set out this present declaration for satisfacti∣on of his Highnesse Subiects of all rankes, concerning his Maiesties course and procee∣dings in this case. And because he hath iust reason to con∣ceiue, that if any of whatsoeuer estate or de∣gree
of his Maiesties Subiects bee so vndu∣tifull, as to haue any scruple of the Iustice and necessitie of his Highnesse proceedings herein, it doeth onely proceed of ignorance or mistaking the trueth of his Highnesse actions: His Maiestie is therefore moued to thinke that there can be no so good and sure way for true information of all his Sub∣iects, as to set downe vnto them the true state of the question, together with all that hath followed and risen thereupon, The mistaking whereof (his Maiestie doth assure himselfe) is the onely cause from whence all scruples in some mens hearts (if any be) doe spring and proceed. His Maiestie for the three or foure last yeeres together before his departure out of this Kingdome, being caried with a most ardent Zeale and earnest Affection to the aduancement of Gods glory and establish∣ing of the Religion presently profest, neuer spared to vndergoe in his owne most Royall and sacred Person almost intolerable paines and fashery for preuenting of all disorders and corruptions which crept into the
Church, and for setting downe and esta∣blishing such a solide and comely forme of gouernment as might be able to preserue the puritie of our Profession, and procure the establishing of a solide Peace and quiet∣nesse in the Church. And for that cause he was euer present at all the frequent Mee∣tings and Assemblies of the Ministerie in this kingdome. And if his Maiesties affaires and other incident occasions had bene such as he could not bee able to keepe the ap∣pointed place and dyet to the which hee had called the assembly, his Highnesse did euer carefully prorogate and continue it, to such other time and place as his leasure might permit him to be present at the said meeting. And as his Maiestie by those his traueils had already put this our Church in a good beginning and forwardnesse of a good order and frame: so he no way doub∣teth, but if he had made any longer stay a∣mongst vs, he would with Gods assistance haue brought it by this time to a reasonable and expected perfection. But such is the malicious enuy of the euill disposed sort,
grudging at the progresse of any good mat∣ter, that some of those Ministers who euer had bene hinderers and crossers of that good worke as farre as they durst, euen in his Maiesties owne presence, conceyting with themselues, that now in his Highnesse absence from this Countrey (with whom they supposed all memory and regard both of Church and Common wealth had bene altogether forgotten and neglected) and that by reason of the assignment of a day in the moneth of Iuly last past, for keeping of an assembly (betwixt the appointment whereof and the time it selfe, interuened that most happy and necessary cause of his Highnes going into England) they thought a very fit occasion was offered to them for prosequution of their intentions. And there∣fore they endeuoured, to the vttermost of their power, to reuerse and ouerthrow all those good orders and godly Constitutions formerly concluded for keeping of good or∣der in their Church, And partly by secret suggestion of false calumnies to the simple and ignorant, and by plotting and combi∣nation
with those of more turbulent spirits, who knowing that their owne inhabilitie would impede them to be any way prefer∣red, made choise with the Camel to drinke in muddy water, and by perturbing of mat∣ters rather to ouerthrow all good order, then that by setling of the Church-gouern∣ment, the vertues of others, and their vices and imperfections should be clearely disco∣uered and distinguished. Therefore to assure themselues the bet∣ter of the compassing of this their desseigne, they spared no time, nor left no meane vn∣assayed to preoccupy mens opinions, to an∣ticipate their votes, and to make vp a strong Faction against the meeting of that assem∣bly, thereby fully intending to bring the estate of this Church to a most euident con∣fusion and disorder. Vpon some notice of the which mischie∣uous Plots and Machinations, his Maiestie considering, that his absence from that fu∣ture meeting of Assembly, and the neere approching of the time appointed for kee∣ping thereof were embraced by those tur∣bulent
spirits as fit opportunities and good occasions offered vnto them so to ouer-rule that matter by thus preparing and packing vp of Votes beforehand, that howsoeuer the better sort should oppose themselues thereunto, yet they should be sure to make the estate of this Church without any rule at all: And therefore his most excellent Maiestie continuing in that fatherly care which hee euer caried to this Church and Realme, by his Highnes Letter signed with his owne hand, directed to the Commis∣sioners of the generall Assembly, signified vnto them his speciall Pleasure and will, That that meeting and assembly appointed to haue beene the second of Iuly now last past, should be deserted; and that no new Indiction should be made either of day or place without his Maiesties consent. And thereafter hee desired, that some of the Bi∣shops, and also some of the best, wisest, and most religious of the Ministery, should repaire towards his Maiestie with all con∣uenient speed, That his Highnesse with their aduice might not onely resolue vpon
all such grounds as were fittest and most ex∣pedient for the setling of the Peace of the Church, but might also appoint some fit and conuenient day and place for holding of a new Assembly. Vpon the receipt of the which Letter, the said Commissioners of the Assembly, by their Missiues directed vnto all the Presbyteries of the Kingdome, certified them of his Maiesties pleasure and will, concerning the deserting of that Mee∣ting; Willing them that they should not in any case send their Commissioners to keep that day formerly appointed, and now by his Maiesties warrant deserted, but that they should expect the appointing of a new day and place for keeping of an Assembly. But so farre were some of the Ministerie from making any accompt of his Maiesties dire∣ctions (a thing most detestable in any sub∣iect, much more in any of the Ministerie, whose Doctrine, Life, and whole Actions ought to be Lanternes to others of all duti∣full obedience to their Prince) as by the con∣trary, in plaine contempt thereof, most se∣ditiously they conuened at Aberdene. And
being guiltie to themselues of their owne inhabilitie, vnworthinesse, and small giftes, conioyned with a bad inclination, they be∣ing in despaire that in doing good they should euer become memorable, and ouer∣ruled with a burning desire of vaine glory, resolued by ouerthrowing the gouernment of this Church, and by inducing all disor∣der thereinto, to make themselues (at least for their euill) famous with that sometime burner of the Temple at Ephesus. And how∣soeuer the aduertisement of his Maiesties Pleasure and will for the deserting of the said Assembly sent by the Commissioners, was dutifully receiued and willingly obey∣ed by the whole Presbyteries almost of this Kingdome; Yet some fewe Ministers (not exceeding the number of eighteene or nin∣teene persons at most, ouer-ruling the rest of their poore brethren of their eight or nine seuerall Presbyteries, ouer whome, by rea∣son of their said brethrens simplicitie, and their owne craftinesse, they had got in time past very much aduantage, & had them in a manner tyed to their girdles to consent to
any thing whatsoeuer) so brought it to passe, as by their procurement, the Decla∣ration of his Maiesties pleasure was con∣temned, and they themselues chosen Com∣missioners to that Meeting, which by his Highnesse commandement was deserted. And wee of his Maiesties Counsell fea∣ring that the presumption of these fewe (howsoeuer in words professing, yet in their deedes directly impugning his Maiesties Authority Royall, vnder a coloured pretext of their zeale to Religion, which alas is now most detestably abused as an ordinarie co∣uer and excuse for euery treason and tres∣passe) thus conuening without regard of his Maiesties command made to the contrary, might be a dangerous preparatiue to the whole Estate, considering that those who should be the teachers of others, were now become the onely violators of their obedi∣ence to their most gracious and religious Souereigne: Therefore wee directed Sir Alexander Strayton of Lawrenston Knight to the said Borough of Aberdene, with speciall warrant and commandement to prohibite
and discharge that fewe number of Mini∣sters from conuening at all; and also by a speciall Missiue written vnto them, wee sig∣nified his Maiesties pleasure concerning the deserting of that Diet. Notwithstanding the publication of which charge at the Mar∣ket Crosse of Aberdene the day before their meeting, they being all in Towne, and of the deliuerie of our Letter; the next day thereafter they being all conuened, were so farre from carying any respect to the charge which was directed and executed in his Maiesties name, or to the Missiue sent from vs, or to the bearer being his Maiesties Com∣missioner in Church affaires; as the first be∣ing contemned directly, the Letter was su∣perficially answered, and the bearer (whose presence at all their doings was ordinarily most necessarie) was neuerthelesse at this time excluded foorth of dores all the time of their keeping that Assembly till the end thereof. A particular relation of all which circum∣stances being faithfully made to his Maie∣stie, his Highnesse tooke occasion with his
owne hand to pen a Declaration, whereby not onely all pretext of excuse or defence which may be pretended by these Ministers is clearely refuted, but also their proud con∣tempt and disobedience is made so mani∣fest, as we do fully assure our selues, no scru∣ple of doubt will remaine with any who is not peruersly preoccupyed to distrust all veritie. The Declaration wee haue presumed to insert in this place, as it came from his Ma∣iestie himselfe, and is this.
BEcause this vnruly handfull of Ministers that made the fashion of keeping of this pretended Assemblie, together with their Associates and Allowers, do so much bragge of the equitie of their cause, and wilfully maintaine that the ground of their proceedings was most iust and necessarie, and if any errour was there∣in, it was onely in forme, which proceeded out of necessitie, in respect of the vnlawfull re∣straint of their liberty, as they alledge: we haue herefore thought good to set downe most suc∣cinctly and shortly the vine Anatomie of their actions, and the true state of their cause; to the intent that power being ioyned to reason (as e∣uer hath bene our constant forme of proceeding) in all our gouernment, their nakednesse being truely discouered, the due punishment to be in∣flicted vpon them may the better appeare in their owne colour as well as their transgression. And therefore whereas they bragge of warrant of conscience, warrant of lawe, the due obser∣uation of their owne customes and liberties, and the respect of the weale of the Church, as the
true Motiues of this their vnruly and seditious contempt; The contrary of all these shall bee made clearely to appeare. And first for warrant of conscience for their generall Assemblie, which they terme the Counsell of God, in the whole olde Testament they will not claime to any warrant of a gene∣rall Assemblie; And in the whole newe Testa∣ment they can alleage no warrant for generall Assemblies, but that conuention of the Apostles at Ierusalem mentioned in the Acts of Apostles, which indeed was an vniuersall counsell of the whole Church, and no wayes like to a particu∣lar Scots generall Assemblie: and therefore they must leaue the Scripture, and haue recourse to the example of the Primitiue Church for war∣rant of particular Nationall Counsels, To which warrant we are assured that they will be asha∣med to claime, in regard many Rites and Cere∣monies, such as Vestiments, Crosse and Confir∣mation, will bee found in the same Primitiue Church which they do vtterly abhorre. And since the Emperours (how soone they became Christians) had the onely vndoubted authoritie in their persons of conuening generall Counsels,
which neuer was taken from them while the Pope ascended to the height of his abominati∣ons; how much lesse ought that authoritie bee denied to a Christian Monarch in the assemb∣ling of a Nationall Councell of his owne Sub∣iects, who hath farre greater and iuster Domi∣nion ouer his owne people, then any vsurping Emperor could claime ouer the face of the whole Earth? And if they will alleadge the new purest writers of our dayes, professours of our Religi∣on, That by their missiue Letter both to the Prince, and State of the Church of Scotland, they haue wished the holding of frequent As∣semblies in that Countrey (but alwayes by the kings permission) as a meane whereby both do∣ctrine and discipline might be maintained with∣out disturbance, and much good thereby procu∣red in the Church of God; yet these very argu∣ments of theirs doe declare, that they onely per∣swade it by way of aduise as a thing very conue∣nient, and did not set it downe as a rule of neces∣sitie and an infallible law. Next as to the warrant of our Law in that kingdom, It is first to be generally obserued, that no priuiledge that any King giues to one particu∣lar
body or state within the kingdome of conue∣ning & consulting among themselues, is to be vn∣derstood to bee Priuatiuè giuen vnto them, and so the King therby depriuing himselfe of his own power and prerogatiue, but onely to be giuen Cumulatiuè vnto them (as the Lawyers call it) without any way denuding the King of his owne power and authority. As for an instance (which hath bene too frequent in all this Ile these yeeres past, sauing the pleasure of God) Euery Burgh Regall haue their owne times of publike mer∣cates allowed vnto them by the Law, and the Kings priuilege: but when the plague happened in any of these townes, did not we by proclama∣tion discharge the holding of the mercate at that time for feare of infection, and yet thereby did no preiudice to their priuiledges, neither did any of them ineptly murmure, much lesse enter into that high contempt as to say they would obey the Kings Lawes in keeping their priuiledges, and not the particular restraint thereof at that time for necessary causes? And as to the nature of their particular pri∣uiledge in holding of assemblies, they haue in this their last pretended Assembly broken the
limitations of that priuiledge that is clearely set downe in the first Acte of the Parliament, in the 92. yeere, which is the latest and clearest warrant for their Assemblie. For there it is spe∣cially prouided, That as wee giue them licence for holding of their Assemblies once in the yeere or ofter as occasion shall require, (which proues that all their power onely proceeds from vs) So must it not bee conuened without our owne presence or then of our Commissioner, nor no day nor place set downe for the next Assemblie but by Our or our Commissioners appoyntment, except we bee not pleased neither to goe in our owne person, neither to send any for assisting the sayd Assembly. And how these limitations haue bene obserued by them at this time, let the world iudge, first in not onely refusing the presence of our Commissioner, but most contemptuously and iniuriously barring the doore vpon him, and next in setting downe the dyet of the next Assembly, without either his priuitie or con∣sent. And as to the third point of their iustifying themselues by the warrant of the constitution & custome of their owne Church, we would know
what warrant they haue for holding of a new assembly without the presence either of the mo∣derator of the last; or of the ordinarie clarke of the assembly; The Clark specially at that instant being dwelling in the same towne where they conuened. For their custome hath euer bene, that the moderator should call for all the Com∣missioners name by name, should see their com∣missions frō their Presbyterie, should giue them the lytis for election of a newe moderator, and make their names (the parties being remoued) freely to be voted among them; but first of all the moderator ought to preach vnto them, and out of the word of God teach them their duetie at that meeting. But as this their pretended Assembly was kept in contempt of our autho∣ritie royall: So had it (praysed be God) no be∣ginning at the word of God, without the which order in their proceeding, we would know what might let as many sundrie generall Assemblies to be conuened at one time in diuerse places of that countrey, as there are seuerall numbers of ninteene ministers through the countrey: And so there should be at one instant farre moe ge∣nerall Assemblies in Scotland one against ano∣ther,
then euer there was Popes in one time in our aduersarie Church. And if they would al∣ledge that the straitnesse of these euill dayes (wherein they liue) compelled them to omit di∣uerse of their auncient and lowable customes, that cannot but imply a direct accusation of our tyrannie, for which this answere may suffice, That besides our knowen sinceritie in religion and constant loue to do Iustice to all our people: They can neuer alledge that they did so much as to send a petition either to our selfe, or in respect of our absence to our Counsell there, for per∣mission of this Assembly. For whereas they al∣ledge that this day was continued by vs and the Commissioners of the Church without affixing a new dyet; we thinke the least they could haue done, had bene humbly to haue craued the ap∣pointing of a new dyet, and patiently to haue ex∣pected either our answere or our Counsels there∣upon, rather then by this their outrageous con∣tempt to haue proclamed either our vniust per∣secution of them, or else (which is the truth) their arrogant and seditious disobedience. And lastly, how carefully they respected the weale of their Church in this course, it is mani∣fest
to the world: First, by needlesse irritating against them their ancient, lawfull, religious and most mercifull King, whereas they might haue come to their owne end by their mild behauiour and due obedience. And next by making as needlesse a separation betwixt all the rest of their learned, wise, graue and duetifull bre∣thren, and them, who for their parts are in this case according to their qualitie as farre lightlied and disgraced by them, as we are diso∣beyed. And thirdly, by bringing on a publike scandall hereby vpon their profession, as rebel∣lious to so religious and iust a King, whereby the aduersaries of our religion (who like roa∣ring Lions goe about to watch such opportuni∣ties) may fill their new bookes and pamphlets with such scandalous memorials against our re∣ligion. And lastly, what charitie they haue by this their behauiour vsed towards their puri∣tane brethren in this countrey, they them∣selues may easily gesse, hauing by this their con∣tempt done nothing else, but animated and spur∣red vs to the straiter animaduersion and order taking with them; lest otherwise, as they are both fauourers of one discipline, so they may
some day by their example (if they had as great libertie) giue proofe of their like disobe∣dience and contempt of our authoritie. NOw leauing it to euery one to ob∣serue both the Patience and Pietie of a most puissant Prince; His Pati∣ence, that after so great a contempt com∣mitted by so meane, base, and abiect per∣sons, who were neuer any way remarkable as men of great gifts, but were specially noted of too great a desire to bee made fa∣mous, if by no other meanes, yet at least by their troubling and ouerturning of mat∣ters: And although his Maiestie had most iust cause of offence against some of them for their great ouersight in former time, and that others of them had most vndutifully in that same action made breach of some pro∣mises made by them vnrequired, to his Ma∣iestie himselfe very fewe moneths before: Yet so superabundant was his lenitie and patience towards them, that after the com∣mitting of the contempt, they were not committed presently, but suffered to staie
at home at their owne houses: neither were they presently brought to their answere; but his Maiestie most patiently in hope of their repentance was pleased a long time to supersede the ordinarie course of Law a∣gainst them. And herewithall his Maiesties Pietie doth most cleerely shine, that beeing euen since his infancie a most gratious nurse-father of the Religion professed, and protector of the professors, but specially of the Teachers of the same; And notwith∣standing that the contempt committed was so hainous, as by the ordinarie course of Iu∣stice, his Maiestie might presently haue bin auenged of those disdainers of his Authori∣tie and Royall commandements: yet so farre was his Maiestie from any rigorous proceeding against them, as by the contra∣rie, to the intent to recall them backe, who were now so farre astray out of the path∣way of obedience, (a most pittifull, yea a most abominable thing in a Minister) it pleased his sacred Maiestie most gratiously of himselfe to set downe that former Decla∣ration, that vpon the view thereof, these
Ministers might see their offence, confesse their guiltinesse, and craue pardon. Where∣in howsoeuer some of them were euer all their life, and likewise at this time so ram∣mage, that they could not be recalled by a∣ny lure; yet were sixe or seuen of that number of nineteene which first conuened, so moued and touched with that open Dis∣couerie made by that Declarator, of their o∣uersight, as in all humilitie before the Lords of his Maiesties Councell then present, pro∣testing their great sorrow for their offence, excusing themselues vpon their ignorance, and purging themselues of all wilfulnesse in that action, they besought their Lordships to bee mediators at his Maiesties hands for a pardon to them. Who presently vpon their humble submission (according as his Maiestie had beene pleased to signifie his will and minde to his Councell) were dis∣missed, and sent home to their houses to at∣tend their charge and ministerie ouer their owne flockes. So farre was his Maiesties heart from intending any rigour against any of that Profession, as by the contrarie, by
his Maiesties present pardoning of them vpon their submission, it doeth manifestly appeare that his Highnesse was farre more willing and readie to embrace their peni∣tence with clemencie, then they could bee capable to deserue the same; imitating herein his great King the king of all kings, who neuer desireth the death, but the a∣mendment of the sinner. And yet it is most true, that those so dismissed vpon their humble submission and repentance, were men of no lesse gifts, but of farre greater sin∣ceritie, knowen good life and conuersation, and nothing inferior to those others which remaine still obstinate, but in vnquietnesse of spirit, hautinesse of minde, and desire of breaking the Peace of the Church. But be∣fore any further bee touched of their con∣uenting before any Iudge, or that any rela∣tion bee made how by their pertinacie of maintaining the first fault (beeing a most presumptuous riot) they came next within the compasse of no lesse offence then Trea∣son: it is not vnmeete that the very point of their first crime, for which they were
brought in question, to answere before his Maiesties Counsel, were cleerely set downe, as well to refute those vaine subterfuges of excuses and pretexts they make for their obstinacie, as to remooue from the godly, religious, and well disposed Subiects, all scruple of any such matter whereof those ministers and their fauorites by lying ru∣mors would sowe the seedes amongst the simple sort, whom they very well know, and wee often finde to be too credulous of euery false report. As therefore the keeping of a generall Assembly was not the matter in question: so is it of veritie, that by this accusation a∣gainst these disobedient ministers, there was nothing laid to their charge concerning the lawfulnesse or vnlawfulnesse of a generall Assembly, nor yet of the power and limits thereof; but that they had vnlawfully made a priuie Conuenticle, not onely directly re∣pugnant and against his Maiestie and Counsels charges and direction, but euen as well against the continuall custome and practise of the Church, as their present con∣sent
which was well witnessed by all the Presbyteries, abstaining from directing any Commissioners thither, sauing that small number of Presbyteries already recited, whereof they were the Commissioners, for they not onely disobeyed his Maiesties Au∣thoritie, who had discharged that time and place of meetings, but euen the will and di∣rection of their owne Church, whose disas∣senting to their proceeding, was not onely manifested by the Commissioners of the generall Assemblies letter, certifying all the Presbyteries of the deserting of the said As∣sembly, but also the Church did by their not sending of Commissioners to that diet, cleerely demonstrate their obedient ac∣knowledgement and acquiescing to his Maiesties wil in that behalfe, of whose pow∣er and lawfull Authoritie in appointing or continuing the times and places of meeting of Assemblies they neuer doubted, beeing so often practised, (as is already rehear∣sed) in his Maiesties owne person, and de∣clared to be his prerogatiue by that same Acte of Parliament by which they are
warranted to keepe the saide Assemblies. And if those Ministers who stand so obsti∣nate in defence of th' assembly (which they must confesse hath onely warrant from that Statute in 92.) would consider how farre the Prince may dispose of the meetings of the Parliament it selfe, as either to prolong, hasten or desert the meeting thereof; and beeing conuened, may dismisse the same without doing any thing at all therein; What foolish prerogatiue and superemi∣nence is this (seeing they must needes ac∣knowledge themselues subalteme) which they would claime aboue the most supreme, high & Honourable meeting of the whole Kingdome? except it be, as so many Popes in their owne conceit, they would exemps themselues altogether from all Saeculart power. And so the particular cause where∣upon these Ministers were conuented be∣fore vs, was nothing else, but that they most seditiously, contemptuously, and in plaine disdaine of his Maiesties Princely com∣mandements and auctority Royal, did con∣uene themselues in a priuy conuenticle,
which they (wronging not onely his Ma∣iestie but the Church, as is already declared) prowdly, seditiously, and most falsly termed and maintaine to bee a generall assembly, notwithstanding of his Highnesse pleasure and will signified to them and their Presby∣teries by missiues from the Commissioners of the generall assembly, that the meeting appointed at Aberdene should desert; And notwithstanding of the prohibition by pub∣lique Proclamation at the Mercate crosse of Aberdene, and of our Letter sent vnto them by the said Sir Alexander Strayton. And how vnlawful and vnduetifull their pretended excuses are, being grounded as they alledge, vpon the feare which they conceiued of the suppressing of their assem∣blies, and ouerthrow of their discipline by the deserting of that assembly once appoin∣ted, let the world iudge; since not onely his Maiesties zeale and care for the mainte∣nance of the Religion is well knowen to all men, but euen in speciall his great loue to this people, in not intending to lay vpon them any new formes or ceremonies, is well
manifested of late, by that Proclamation which his Maiestie hath caused to be pub∣lished for clearing of all such doubts out of his peoples heart: The tenour whereof followeth. WHereas we haue euer since it pleased God to establish vs in the Imperiall Crowne of great Britaine, equally regarded the good of both the late Kingdomes of Scotland and England, now happily vnited in our royall person in one Monarchie, euer minding to main∣taine and continue the good and lowable cu∣stomes and Lawes whereby each of them hath bene these many ages so worthily gouerned: ne∣uerthelesse some malitious spirits, enemies to that common tranquillitie so much desired by vs (forgetting the many proofes both publique and priuate, which we haue giuen of that our gratious affection to that our natiue and anci∣ent countrey of North Britaine, of the free∣dome, libertie and priuiledges whereof we haue at all occasions taken so speciall a patrociny, as the solemne assemblies of the Estates of South-Britaine,
and Commissioners from the Estates of both Kingdomes haue bene eye witnesses) haue not bene ashamed to labour to peruert the minds of our best affected Subiects, That whereas the insolent and factious cariage of some of them hath merited most seuere ani∣maduersion, the would insinuate themselues in the commiseration of the multitude, by assu∣ming vnto them a glorious profession of the maintayning of the Priuiledges and auctorised Discipline, intended by vs (as they affirme) to be vtterly ouerthrowne by a suddaine and vnseasonable laying vpon them at this present the Rites, Ceremonies, and whole Ecclesiasti∣call order established in the Church of this part of our Kingdome of Britaine. And as we haue euer carefully regarded how conuenient it is to maintaine euery Countrey in that forme of gouernment which is fittest and can best a∣gree with the constitution thereof, and how dan∣gerous alterations are without good aduice and mature deliberation, and that euen in matters of order of the Church, in some small Ilands vn∣der our Dominions, we haue abstained from suffering any alteration: So doubt we not, but
our good Subiects will neuer be that credulous contrary to the knowen trueth, which hath euer appeared clearely in all our Actions, as to bee in any doubt, but as in all our proccedings we haue bene a Patrone of Religion and Iustice (two inseparable conseruers of all Monarchies,) So hath all our study and care euer bene to retrench and reforme all courses that caried any preiu∣dice to that integritie whereat wee haue euer aymed, and as by so many good Lawes set forth in our gouernment, Iustice hath attained to an∣other perfection and splendor, then it had in a∣ny our predecessours times, and with painefull and vnpleasant businesse, we haue in the disci∣pline of the Church taken away innumerable abuses and corruptions, which if they had not bene remedied, had brought the puritie of Re∣ligion in extreeme danger. Yet wee hope that none dare be so impudent as to affirme that by our Soueraigne power, or absolute commande∣ment wee did the same (although wee enioyed our auctoritie a freely as any King or Mo∣narch of the world) but as the disease of the Ciuill body was euer cured by the aduice of our three Estates, So the defects of the Church by
the helpe and counsell of those who had greatest interest in them, So as the presumption of our by-gone actions in our administration, whiles we were present, the proofe of our fatherly care towards that part of our Kingdome since our residence here, may bee sufficient to secure vs against all such malitious calumniations. And how euer in rule of pollicie wee cannot but iudge it conuenient that two Estates so inseparably conioyned, should be drawen to as great confor∣mitie in all things as the good of both may per∣mit; And that no Monarchy either in Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall pollicie hath yet attained to that perfection, that it needs no reformation, or that infinite occasions may not arise whereupon wise Princes will foresee for the benefit of their States, iust cause of alteration: Yet are wee and haue euer bene resolued, not to make any sud∣daine or hasty change in the gouernment of that part of our Kingdome, either Ciuill or Eccle∣siasticall, but with graue aduice and consent of our Estates, and the wisest and best sort of them whom it most properly concerns, much lesse to trouble them with any vnnecessary alteration of indifferent and Ceremoniall matters, and that
vpon such foreseene aduantages, and preuenti∣on of confusion and euill to come, as the greatest enemies of all Peace, obedience to Princes, and order in all gouernments shall not obtrude any inconuenient to the contrary. And as by Gods holy assistance, we haue drawen that part of our Kingdome out of infinite troubles, factions, and cruell barbarities, and reduced the vtter∣most borders and confines thereof to Gods obe∣dience, and acknowledging of our Lawes; (an Estate neuer heard of before, since this Iland hath bene inhabited) So by the same diuine prouidence and our fatherly care ouer the whole Iland, we intend to transmit the same in good order, happy quietnesse, and flourishing pollicie to that posteritie wherewith God hath blessed vs, and after them to the worlds end; Like as for the more verification of our Honourable intention, and to stop the mouthes of these vn∣quiet spirits, raysors of that false scandall of al∣teration, We haue appointed a generall assembly to be holden at Dundee the last Tuesday of Iu∣ly, whereat we expect reparation of those disor∣ders in so farre as belongeth to their censure,
and to bee freed in time comming of all such calumnies. Giuen at our Honour of Hampton Court the xxvj. day of September 1605. yeeres, In the third yeere of our raigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. AFter the publication and imprinting of which Proclamation for indiction of a new assembly, it being still ho∣ped by vs that those Ministers remayning in Ward, vpon the sight of their owne offences, with repentance for the same, should humbly haue besought his Maiestie for pardon; yet did their obstinacie still continue, iustifying all their proceedings, as if they had committed no crime at all. Whereupon wee of his Maiesties Counsell, fearing the imputation of vnduetifull and vndiligent seruants, if by this our procrasti∣nation (vpon vaine hopes) of the triall of their offence, wee should leaue it vnder the hazard of euery ones censure to be iudged by the multitude, according as their parti∣cular conceits should lead them; It was
therefore thought meete to call them to their answere before vs, for that their most seditious, proud and contemptuous diso∣bedience to his Maiesties commandement and prohibition. Being called vpon and all present, and enquired what defence they would make for themselues, either to iustify or excuse that their intollerable riot and contempt, first by speach, and then by writ they gaue in the declinator following, as disclayming themselues altogether from any subiection to his Maiestie, and his Counsell, making all their actions of what∣soeuer sort (by their owne interpretation) to be meere Spirituall, and that their mee∣ting the second of Iuly last at the Borough of Aberdene, was such an essentiall Ecclesi∣asticall matter, warranted by Gods word, that therein they did no offence. And if any they had done, the Counsell of any se∣cular Prince was no way to iudge them, but their owne assembly. A most lewd & vaine position; It beeing a certaine and infallible Maxime in the Law, that their answer could not exceed the limits of the Libell and ac∣cusation:
And therefore they being onely accused at that time for such a priuate and vnlawfull misdemeanour, their declinator could not but directly deny his Maiesties auctoritie in that particular point. Where∣of we haue likewise set downe the tenour. MY Lords of secret Counsell; Pleaseth your Lordships, The approbation or disallowance of a generall Assembly, hath bene, and should bee a matter and cause Spirituall, and alwayes cognosced and iudged by the Church, as Iudges competent within this Realme. And seeing wee are called before your Lordships to heare and see it be found and declared, That wee haue very contemptuously and seditiously conuened and assembled our selues in a generall Assembly at Abeirdein the first Tewsday of Iuly last, and therefore the said Assembly, and approbation thereof decer∣ned and declared to bee vnlawfull, as at more length is conteined in the summonds executed against vs thereanent; We in consideration of the premisses, and other reasons to be giuen by vs, haue iust cause to decline your Lordships
iudgement, as no wayes competent in the cause aboue specified. And by these presents we sim∣pliciter decline the same, Seeing wee are most willing to submit our selues to the triall of the generall Assembly onely Iudge competent. By these presents Subscribed with our handes as followeth, At Edinburgh the 24. day of Octo∣ber, the yeere of God 1605. yeeres, Sic subscri∣bitur: M. Iohn Forbes, M. Iohn Welsche, M. Ion Monro, M. Androe Duncane, M Alex∣ander Stranchane, M. Iames Greig, M. Wil∣liam Forbes, M. Robert Yongston, M. Na∣than Inglis, M. Charles Ferme, M. Iames Irwing, M. Iohn Scharp, M. Robert Durie, Iohn Rosse. THis Declinator being repelled, and they hauing vsed some other friuo∣lous defences with more losse of time then vttering of any matter, at last all being repelled, they were found to haue conuened most vnlawfully contrary to his Maiesties warrant and charge giuen to the contrary. And being returned to their se∣uerall prisons, vpon aduertisement giuen to
his Maiestie of the whole proceedings in that Processe before the Counsell, and of that proud presumption of those ministers in propounding the said Declinator, with∣out any respect to that Acte of Parliament made in Maij 1584. or any paine which they incurred by doing therof (which was, That any persons either Spirituall or Tem∣porall presuming to decline the Iudgement of his Maiestie and his Counsell in any mat∣ter whatsoeuer, shall incurre the paine of Treason) therefore his Maiestie presently sent his Royall direction to his Counsell, that the ordinary course of Iustice accor∣ding to the Lawes of this his Highnesse Realme, should proceede against those mi∣nisters, who by the propounding of that Declinature had made a plaine denyall of their subiection to his Maiestie, and of his Royall power and Authoritie ouer them. Whereupon sixe of them being then in pri∣son within the Castle of Black-nesse, were vpon the tenth of Ianuarie last brought to his Maiesties Borough of Lynlithgrw, and there presented vpon panel before his High∣nesse
Iustice being the ordinarie Iudge of all matters Criminall, who had ioyned to him a great number of Noblemen and others of his Maiesties Counsell by his Highnesse Commission to assist the said Iustice in that matter. And their Inditement being groun∣ded vpon that first Statute made in Maij 1584. and vpon that their presumptuous Fact in declining the Counsels iudgement when they were first brought to their an∣swere, they were then demanded what they could say for themselues before the matter should passe to the tryall of a Iurie. And notwithstanding that some of their owne brethren, vpon earnest request to the Coun∣sell hauing obtained Licence & permission to conferre with them and perswade them to an humble submission and penitence; as likewise that their two principall Procu∣rators and Counsellors at Law not being a∣ble to perswade them to this same course of humility wherein they dealt with them ear∣nestly, did vpon their obstinacie directly re∣fuse to pleade for them; and lastly notwith∣standing that they were publikely admo∣nished
by the Iudge the very time of their standing at the Barre, that putting off that maske ot wilfulnesse (the onely thing which so blinded them from sight of their owne follies) they would humbly craue his Maie∣sties pardon, of whose great Clemencie, in case of their submission, all that were pre∣sent, had very great hopes and vttered great assurances: Yet such was their malignant and indurate obstinacie, as hardening their hearts against all these publicke and priuate perswasions and admonitions, they wilful∣ly persisted in iustifying their Actions; Ha∣uing still the assistance of so many Counsel∣lours at Law as would stay with them: and the only thing they could alledge for them∣selues why they should not go to the tryall of an Assise, was, that the said Statute of Maij 1584. was thereafter interpreted and limitted by a particular clause of a Statute made in 1592. wherein it is declared that the said Act made in 1584. against the de∣clyning of the Counsels iudgement, shall no way be preiudiciall nor derogate any thing to the priuiledges which God hath giuen to
the Spirituall office-bearers in the Church, concerning heads of Religion, matters of Heresie, Excommunication, collation or de∣priuation of Ministers, or any such like es∣sentiall Censures, specially grounded, and hauing the warrant of the word of God. And herein they doe alleadge that their meeting at that time in Aberdene being an essentiall censure, warranted by Gods word, they might lawfully decline the Counsels iudgement from taking cognition therein. Whereunto it was answered by his Ma∣iesties Aduocate of that his Highnes King∣dome, That that their defence was to be repelled, because the keeping of an Assem∣bly at a certaine time and place, and the ap∣pointing of another assembly of new, con∣trary to his Maiesties charge, and against the will and command of his Highnesse Counsell of this Kingdome, and notwith∣standing of the disassenting of his Maiesties Commissioner; much lesse the keeping of that petty Conuenticle in the towne of A∣berdene that second of Iuly last past, is not any head of Religion, matter of Heresie,
Excommunication or essentiall Censure whatsoeuer; and so being no way vnder that limitation, must of all necessitie come vnder the generalitie of the former Statute in the 84. and they must haue incurred the paine of Treason for declining the Coun∣sailes Iudgement, being called to their an∣swere vpon their contempt. And likewise in that same very clause of interpretation of the former Acte, howeuer it is declared that the sayd Statute shall no way make deroga∣tion to the Priuiledge that the office bearers in the Church haue giuen them concerning Religion, Heresie and other Ecclesiasticall censures (wherein his Maiestie will be euer farre from the assuming vnto himselfe any Papall and tyrannicall Authoritie ouer the expresse word of God) Yet doeth not that clause inferre such a Priuatiue of his Maie∣sties Souereigntie, as may denude him of that lawfull power which Christian Kings haue ouer the Churches that are within their dominions. The matter going to the triall of an Assise, these sixe are found guilty of high treason, and returned to their seuerall
prisons. And therfore as hereby this proud contempt and disobedience of this small handfull of ministerie (to the very great griefe and sorowe of all the well disposed of that profession in this kingdome) is clerely and truely set downe (that the ignorance thereof should not be the occasion of mis∣taking by any, of the most iust and necessa∣ry causes enforcing this hard proceeding a∣gainst them) so are the said wilfull and ob∣stinate persons to be left to their iust punish∣ment for their deserts, whereunto they haue most contentiously constrained his Maie∣stie, and in a maner extorted the same a∣gainst his will. And neuerthelesse since there is no con∣tempt whatsoeuer, but hath the owne fa∣uourers, no folly but by some patronised and allowed, and that vpon vaine curiositie (notwithstanding of their knowledge to the contrary) some will not sticke to main∣taine Paradoxes and defend absurdities, which (howsoeuer in matters friuolous and of no moment might be ouerslipt & not re∣garded) yet in such matters concerning his
Maiesties royall Auctoritie, and the excu∣sing or iustifying of high and proud con∣tempts by any sort or ranke of persons, so farre should wee of his Highnesse counsell (in our duety and alleageance to our Prince and Souereigne) bee from any sort of care∣lesnesse or negligence, as hereby wee haue thought meete to signifie his Maiesties spe∣ciall pleasure and wil, that he doeth streight∣ly command & charge all his Highnes sub∣iects of this his Kingdome (of whatsoeuer ranke, place, calling, function or condition they be) that none of them presume to take vpon them, either in publique or priuate, to murmure or call in question in any sort, this his Maiesties prerogatiue, and auctoritie Royall, or the lawfulnes of this proceeding against the said Ministers, or any way to make constructions, or to mis-interprete that acte of Parliament of the yeere 1584. concerning the declining of his Maiesties and his Counsels iudgment, otherwise then the same is made cleare and manifest by this present decision of the Iustice in the tri∣all of the said Ministers, with certification to
them that shall contrauene the same, that they shalbe really punished in the qualitie of seditious persons, and wilfull contemners of his Maiesties most iust and lawfull go∣uernment. Giuen at Edinburgh the seuenth day of March, Jn the third yeere of his Maiesties raigne of great Britaine, France and Jreland. 1606.
