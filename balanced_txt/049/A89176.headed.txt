A mis-le King, and a memorable PARLIAMENT. THis present occasion so opportunely befitting me, I am resolved to treat of that which hath been omitted, and slipped out of memory long since, concerning divers and sundry changes and alterations in England in former times: Nor will it be any wayes burthensome to write of that, whereby every good and carefull Reader may learne to avoid diversities of miseries, and the danger and feare of cruell death. I will there∣fore speake of that which hath laine hid in the darksome shade of forgetful∣nesse, concerning men who have been led away by the deceitfull path o Covetousnesse, and have come to a most shamefull and ignominious death: a famous example to deterre all men from practising those or the like courses. ABout the yeare of Christ 1386. at such time as Richard, the second of that name, then in prime of his youth, swayed the Imperiall Ser of our Realme, there flourished famous in his Court certaine Peeres, though some of them not of any honourable descent, yet favoured by fortunes; by name, Alexander Neil; Archbishop of Yorke; Robert Veee, D. of Ireland; Michael de la Poole, Earle of Suffolke, then Lord Chancellour; Ro∣bert Tressilian, Lord chiefe Justice of England; and Nicholas Brambre, some∣times Major of London. These men being raised from mean estates, by the speciall favour of the King, and advanced to the degree of privie Counsellours, were the men who had the only rule of the Common-wealth; which they, under the King, governed for some small space, with carefull diligence, meriting thereby deserved commendations. But not long did they thus steere the Ship of the Kingdome: for many of them being of inferiour ranke by birth, not having their veines dignified with the streames of noble blood; they were the soo∣ner enticed with the fibidinous baits of voluptuousnesse, and infected with in∣satiable itch of avarice: insomuch, that despising the authority of the King, and neglecting the commodity of the Realme, but onely desiring to keep up the Revenues of the Kingdome, so wrought, that by their policie, the King is impoverished, the Treasury exhausted; the Commons murmure at the mul∣tiplicity of Tenths; Levies, and Subsidies; the Peeres repine to see themselves
disgraced, and their inferiours honored; and in a word, the whole Kingdome endures an universall misery. The Nobility seeing the miserable estate wherein the Kingdome lay, blee∣ing as it were to death, urged their King to summon a Parliament; which was done shortly after. In which amongst many other Acts, the afore-named Michael de la Poole is dismist of his Chancellorship; and being accused of di∣vers and many points of injustice, as Bribery, Extortion, and the like, he was soon cast into the Castle of Windsor, and all his lands, which were of no small Revenue, were consiseated to the King. Neither did the Parliament here give over, but provided further for the whole State; by the mutuall consent of the King and Prelates, Barons and Commons, with an unanimous conjunction, they constitute and give plenary and absolute power to certaine Commissio∣ners, as well of the Spiritualty as Temporalty, for the ordering and disposing of the publique affaires, according, as shall seem best and most necessary for the desperate estate of the Common-wealth, to depresse civill dissentions, and to pacisie and appease the grudgings of the people. Of the Spiritualty were chosen the Archbishop of Canterbury, the afore∣named Bishop of York, the Bishop of Ely, lately made Chancelor of England, the Bishop of Winchester; Bishop of Hereford, Lord Treasurer; Bishop of Exeter, Abbot of Waltham, and the Lord Iohn of Waltham. Of the Laity were elected the Duke of York, the Earle of Arundel, the Lord Goltham, the Lord Scroop, and Iohn Devoureux Knight: these as men e∣minent in vertue, were chosen by the generall Suffrage, and sworn to carry themselves as dutifull and obedient subjects in all their actions. And it was further enacted, That if any should refuse or disobey the Ordinances so made for publick good, the punishment of his first offence, should be the cosiscation of his goods; and for the second, the losse of life. Thus disposing of all things for the best, the Parliament being dissolved, euery man returned to his owne house. Soon after, the afore-named Chancelor, with others of their consederates, being moved with implacable fury against the Statute of the late Parliament, they buzzed into the Kings eares, that the Statutes lately enacted, were very prejudiciall to the honour of his Crowne, and much derogatory to his Princely Prerogative: insomuch that he should not have power, without the consent of the new-appointed Commissioners, to doe any thing befitting a King; no, not so much as to bestow a largesse, a principall meanes to gain the peoples love, upon any, though never so well deserving. By these and other the like impious instigations, with which the Divel (as never unmindful of the end of those, who by their lives do prove themselves) did continually supply them, they practised to annihilate and disanull these
Acts of the Parliament, which seemed any wayes to abbreviate or curb their usurped authority. And first, by their serpentine tongues, ambitious projects, flattery painted out with glosing discourses, and covered over with the shadow of vigilan for the good of the Kingdome, they so be witched the noble inclination of the youthfull King, whom they induced to beleeve, that all the ill they did, was a generall good, that he began to distalte, and at last to abhorte the last passed Acts, as treacherous plots, and most wicked devices. Next, they studied how to ingrosse all, or the most part of the wealth and ri∣ches of the Kingdome into their own coffers; and to the same end, dealt so cunningly, yet pleasingly with the King, that hee gave to the D. of Ireland, Iohn of Bloys, the heir of the Dutchy of Britaine, and his ransome; to others, Townes; to others, Cities; to others, Lands; to others, Money, amounting to the summe of 100000 Markes, to the great impoverishment both of King and Kingdome: neither did these King-eaters and Realm-devourers any thing regard it, but setting unskilfull and insufficient Captaines and Gover∣nours over Townes and Forts so obtained, gave occasion to the enemies of the Crowne to surprise them, and dispossesse the King of them. Thirdly, vilifying the dignity of the King, contrary to their allegeance, they drew the King to sweare, that with all his power, during his life, hee should maintain and desend them from all their enemies, whether forraigne or domestick. Fourthly, whereas it was enacted by the last Parliament, that the King at certain seasonable times, and when his leasure would permit him, should sit at Westminster with his Councell there, to consult of the publique affaires; through the perswasions of the aforesaid Conspirators, hee was drawne into the most remotest parts of the Realme, to the great disparagement of the fide∣lity of those honorable, grave, and faithfull Peeres, late made joynt Commis∣sioners, in whose hands the whole safety and prosperity of the Common∣wealth did recide. And when as the Lord Chancelour, the Lord Treasurer, Keeper of the Pri∣vie Seale, or any other of the Privie Councell, came to relate any of their owne actions, or the state of the Realme, they could not bee granted free ac∣cesse, unlesse they related the businesse in the presence and hearing of the conspirators, who were alwayes ready to upbraid them if they uttered any thing that displeased them, and to command them for any thing (though most nefarious) that did content them: for thus could they the sooner learne and dive into the acts of the Commissioners, and the better find evasions for their accusations: Furthermore, when as the King in company of the Con∣spirators went in progresse towards the parts of Cheshire, Wales, and Lan∣cashire, they made proclamation in the Kings name, throughout the Shires as
they journied, That all Barous, Knights, Esquires, with the greatest part of the Communalty able to beare armes, should speedily repaire to the King for his defence against the power of the Comissioners, chiefly of the Duke of Glo∣cester and the Earle of Arundel; because they above the rest, did with their chiefest endevours, study to suppresse & quell the devices of the conspirators. Fifthly, contrary to the aforesaid Acts, they caused the D. of Ireland to bee treated chiefe Justice of Chester, thereby selling justice as they listed, con∣demning the guiltlesse, and remitting the guilty, never respecting or looking unto the equall ballance of justice, but poizing downe the scales with heaps of Bribery. Sixthly, by the procurement of the confederates, they caused certain honest persons, who would not consent to their extortions, to be called and summo∣ned to their Court, and thereto answer to certaine false accusations, where∣with they were unjustly charged by perjuring hirelings; of which men so ac∣cused, some were put to death, some cast into prison, all were vexed and trou∣bled with delayes, length of their journey to and fro, and excessive charges; neither were they eased of any these burthens, unlesse they would part with round summes of money to the D. and his Complices. Seventhly, they gave pardons under the Brod Seal, to Felons, Murderers, and such like, only with this condition, that they should murther any whom∣soever they thought did mislike their exaction. Eighthly, they taught the countrey of Ireland to look to its pristine estate, I mean, of having a King; for they plotted how to have the Duke created King of Ireland: And for the confirmation of which their designe, they allured the King to send his letters to the Pope. Ninthly, the aforesaid Nicholas Brambre, in the time of his Majoralty, cau∣sed two and twenty to be falsly accused of Felonies, and laid into Newgate, under pretext and colour of divers crimes, and in the silent and dead time of the night to be fast bound, and by a strong hand to be carried into Kent, to a place commonly called Fawlocks, and then to have their heads struck off, ex∣cept one who being favoured by the murtherers, safely escaped; the blood of the test died the streames of a small Rivelet adjoyning. Tenthly, soon after, to adde one mischief to another, they sent letters under the Kings Sigret, to the Major of London, by Iohn Rippon Clerke, with a certain libell, or schedule inclosed in the said letters, the tenor of which is as followeth. That the afore-named three Commissioners, viz. the Duke of Glocester, the Earles of Arundel and Warwick, and other of the Councell, were to bee arrested, indicted, condemned, and put to a lamentable death as being such as had conspired against the King, against his prevogative & against his Crown and Imperiall dignity; and to this they did in a manner constrain the King to
assent unto. Upon receit of these letters, the Major and Aldermen of the Citie of London, called a Common Councell, wherein they consulted what course were best to be taken in this matter; and after long debate, pro & con, it was on all sides agreed, to deny and not to suffer that cruell and unheard of Tragi∣call Complot to be executed. It ever happeneth, one wicked act drawes on a second, and that second a third, and so forwards, till the weight crackes the supporter. Therefore the sail Conspirators being blinded with rashnesse, principally sent letters by Iohn Godfrey Knight, to the King of France, the Kings adver∣sary, to conclude a five yeares truce, should come over to Callis, and from thence should send for the Duke of Glocester, the Earles of Arundell and Warwick, and for some other of the Commissioners, as though the King were unwilling to determine of any thing without their advice; and being thus circumvented, should be condemned as traytors, and so put to an ignomi∣nious and cruell death. And for doing and performing of these things, the King of France was to recover all the Castles, Townes, and Lands lying in these countries, and be∣longing to the King of England. To prove these things to be true, there were certaine writings produced by the Commissioners, wherein were con∣tained letters from the King of France to the King of England, and from the conspirators in the King of Englands name, to the King of France. Moreover, there were other letters intercepted, directed to the said King of France, the substance whereof was, to incite the King of France to leavre a puissant power into England, against the Duke of Glocester, the Earles of Arundel and Warwicke, and the rest of the Commissioners, and all those that did either countenance or favour the said statute and Commissioners. Now here concluding their divelish conspiracie, the five aforesaid conspi∣tators departed from Westminster to the Castle of Nottingham, and sent a Writ for Robert Beale, Lord chiefe Justice of the Common-Pleas, Iohn Holt, Reger Fulthorp & Will. Burleigh, Judges of the said Court, and for John Locton, the Kings Serjeant at Law: who being come into the Councell-chamber, not knowing what they were sent for, the aforesaid conspirators caused the gates and doores of the Castle to be shut, and then propounded these que∣stions following unto them. First, whether those Statutes, Ordinances, and Commission, made in the late Parliament at Westminster, were derogatory to the Kings dignity and Kingly Prerogative; and, because they were to be punished who did procure those Constitutions, and did incite and move the King to consent unto them, and did as much as in them lay to hinder the King from exercising his Royall Prerogative. To these and other the like questions, with a joynt consent they answered,
death as traytors, or else to endure some capitall  witnesse of which assertion, being terrified with the feare of present death, the aforesaid Judges, together with Iohn Carey, Lord chiefe Baron of the Exchequer, they signed and sealed a certaine writing in man∣ner of a Protestation, in presence of these witnesses, Alex. Nevil, Archbishop of Yorke, Archbishop Bangor, Robert Duke of Ireland, Michael Earle of Suf∣folke, Iohn Rippon Clerke, and Iohn Blake Fruiterer, dated the 19 of September, Anno Dom. 1387. in the 11. yeare of the reigne of K. Richard 2. Then were they compelled to sweare, that they should keep the passages undiscovered, upon pain of death; and so they had licence to depart. And that which is worse, they caused the King to sweare, That in his pro∣per person, with his whole power, he should take revenge of the Duke of Glocester, of the two Earles and their adherents, by causing them to bee put to death. But, God inspired into the hearts of the aforesaid Duke of Glocester, the Earles of Arundel and Warwicke, the spirit of valour and magnanimity, who seeing the heap of ills that daily did arise by the practices of those cospirators, they set almost in every part of the Kingdome, intelligencers, who should apprehend all Messengers, and intercept all letters of the Kings, or that went under the Kings name, and should send them to the Commissioners. And thus did they come to have intelligence of the whole plot of the con∣spirators; all their Letters being indorced, with Glory bee to God on high, on earth peace, and good will towards men: and by comming to the knowledge of each circumstance, they found, that the Kingdome was at the point of de∣struction; according to that Evangelicall saying, Every Kingdome divided a∣gainst it selfe, shall be dissolved: Wherefore they sought for a remedy; every man according to his ability, levied a power for the preservation of the King and Kingdome: all which forces being united, amounting to the number of 20000. fighting men, and couragiously resolving to frustrate all the intended designes of the conspirators, and to open the nut by cracking the shell, they divided their Army, committing part of it to the Earle of Arundel: who by night marched away with his Forces, and pitched his tents neer to Lon∣don, there fortifying himself in the Forrest adjoyning, till such time as he had gained more convenient time, and greater force, by the comming of his con∣sorts. On the other side, the conspirators intending to prevent their purpo∣ses, by power of a certaine Spirituall Commission, and by vertue of certaine Letters Patents in the hands of the Conspirators, though nothing to the pur∣pose; yet to blind the people, they caused to be proclaimed throughout the whole Citie of London, that none upon paine of the forfeiture of all their goods, should neither sell, give, or communicate privatly or publickly, victual, armour, or any other necessaries to the Army of the Earle of Arundel, but
should barre them of sustentation, comfort, or help, as Rebels to the King and countrey. But on the other side, they began to feare, when they were denied their hoped-for aid by the Major and Communalty of the Citie of London. And againe, they were troubled at the rising of the Commoners, to invade them. Wherefore they counselled the King to absent himsent from the Parliament, (which was to begin at Candlemas next, according as the King and Commissioners had appointed it) and not consult of the af∣faires of the Kingdome, nor of his owne Estate, commodity or discom∣modity, unlesse the Duke of Glocester, the two Earles of Arundel and War∣wicke, with the rest of the Commissioners, would sweare, That neither they, nor any in their name, should accuse them, or urge any accusation against them. Not long after it happened, that the King, with the aforesaid five Con∣spirators, came from his Mannor at Sheeve, to Westminster, to Saint Edmonds Tombe, for the solemnizing of a Pilgrimage. The Major and Aldermen of the Citie of London met him on horseback sumptuously attired, honoring him very much. And when they came to the Mewes, they descended from their horses, and went bare-foot to the Tombe of S. Edmond; where as the Chaplaine of the Commissioners, with the Abbot and Covent, met them with a stately Pro∣cession. In the mean time, the three Noble-men, viz. the Duke of Glocester, and the Earles of Arundel and Warwicke having mustered their Troopes on the fourteenth of November, in the same yeare, at Waltham Crosse, in the County of Hertford, and from thence sent for the Commissioners that were there at Westminster in Parliament with the King, sending an accusation in wri∣ting to the King, against the aforesaid Conspirators, viz. the Archbishop of Yorke, Duke of Ireland, Earle of Suffolke, Robert Trisilian, and Nicholas Brambre; wherein they accused them of high treason: which their appel∣lation they did offer to maintain, and that they were willing to prosecute the same; and to prove it to be true, they caused also the rest of the Commissioners to subscribe, as parties to their appellation. When these things came to the eares of the King, he sent unto them, re∣quiring to know what their request was, and what they wished to have been done: They returned answer thus: That they did desire, that the Traytors which were alwayes about him, filling his eares with false reports, and did daily commit insufferable crimes and injuries, might be rewarded with con∣digne punishment. And likewise craved, that they might have safe liberty of going and comming to his grace. When the King heard their request, he gave them is Royall consent, and commanded them to appeare at Westminster; and the King sitting on his
Throne in the great Hall, the three aforesaid Peeres Appellants with a great troop of Gentlemen, entred, & making three lowly obeysances, on their ben∣ded knees, they reverenced the King: and drawing neere (the cause of their comming being alledged) they there againe appealed the Archbishop, Duke of Ireland, Earle Treasurer, and Brambre of hightreason, according as they had done before at Waltham Crosse; but they betaking themselves to the private corners of the Palace, even as Adam and Eve from the presence of God, not having the heart to appeare, to justifie themselves. The King called forth the Appellants, to prove and prosecute the Appel∣lation, prescribing them a day and place for the triall, which was to be on the day after Candlemas day; and in the mean time, the King commanded them upon their Honours, not any party to molest the other untill the next Par∣liament. The Duke of Ireland, under the guide of his grand Captaine the Divell, marching into Cheshire, Lancashire, and Wales, raised a new power, amoun∣ting to the number of 6000 fighting men; from thence marched towards London with his Army, with a furious intent and resolution to performe his bloody designe. And whilst these plots were laid, the Appellants being sud∣denly advertised thereof, raised a great power, and joyning with them the Earle of Derby, and the Earle of Nottingham, and other Commissioners, marched with long and wearied marches into a field neere a village called Whitney, at a place called Lockeford Bridge: In which field the Duke of Ire∣land was with his Army, having a river on the one side of them, whereas they stood ready prepared to give an overthrow to the Appellants, and displaying the Kings Standard, contrary to the Lawes of the land. When they saw the Army of the Appellants march down from the mountaines, like a Hive of Bees, and with such a violent fury, fear benummed them, and they were so amazed, that when they should give the assault (God not suffering the effu∣sion of blood) they stood like a Hive of Bees, or a flocke of Cattell with∣out a head, without any stroke given, they flung down their Armes, and yeel∣ded themselves to the mercy of the Appellants; and a few being slaine, and some drowned in the river, gave an easie victory to the Conquerours. When the newes of the victory was blowne to the eares of the rest of the conspirators, who were then stricken with feare, and carefull for their pre∣servation, under covert of the night, they fled by water to the Tower, draw∣ing the King along with them. On the other side Nicholas Brambre with a bold and resolute courage, in the Kings name, caused all the gates of the Citie to be shut against the Apel∣lants, and to be guarded with an able and sufficient Watch: But these wor∣thy and dauntlesse members of the Common-wealth, marched towards Lon∣don to confer with the King; but when they heard that the said Nicholas
Brambre had caused the gates of the Citie to be shut against them, and to be strongly guarded, and that the whole Citie did purpose to keep them out, they stayed their resolution. On the 27 day of September, they encamped themselves in Clarkenwell, within the liberties of the Citie of London. And when as the Major, with the Citizens, came unto them with pleasing words, promising unto them all that the Citie could affoord with reason and equity; the Duke of Glocester said, Now I know, that liers speak nothing but lies, neither can any man hinder them from the relating: whereupon by a joynt consent in the evening, they removed their tents, and pitched them before divers gates of the Citie. On the morrow there happened an enterview between the King and the Appellants, so far, that they opened their mindes one to the other: but be∣cause the King loathed to speak with them, with such a rabble of men, and in regard of an intolerable boldnes, & some quarrell which was like to arise; and on the other side, refusing to go out of the Tower to speak with them, and the Appellants fearing some violence or wrong to be offered to them, would not speak with the king without a strong guard of valiant warriors. Therefore the most wise of the Appellants, after divers disputations had, resolved to go and confer with the King: but first they sent a strong Troop well armed, to search al the Corners & Caves of the Tower; and relation being made of the safety of the place, with a selected band of valiant Cavaliers, they entred the Tower; and seizing the gates, & placing a guard, appeared before the King; and there the third time appealed the aforesaid conspirators in the same sort and forme as before: which appellation being ended, the King swore, That he would ad∣here to their counsell as a good King, and a just Judge, so farre as the rule of Law, Reason, and Equity did require. Then it was published and made knowne in the presence of the King, and throughout the Dominions, that on the morrow after Candlemas day, the a∣foresaid conspirators should personally appeare, to answere to the appella∣tion, whereby they were charged of so many treasons. They expulsed divers of the Officers of the Houshold; viz. in the place of John Beauchamp, Steward of the Houshold, they appointed John Devon∣vex, Knight, one of the Commissioners; Peter Courtney, Knight, was made Chamberlaine in stead of Robert Duke of Ireland. And the foresaid John de Beauchamp, Simon de Burleigh, Vice Chamberlaine, Iohn Salisbury, Thomas Try∣net, Iames Barats William Ellingham, and Nicholas Nagworth, Knights; and Officers of the Clergy, (viz.) Richard Mecford Secretary, Iohn Blake Deane of the Chappell, John Lincolne Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Iohn Clif∣ford Clerke of the Chappell, were kept under arrest too, and were as parta∣kers in the aforesaid Treason; for that they knowing and having intelligence of the said Conspiracy, they did not discover them.
And thus this hideous brood of Monsters, so often shaken, was quite over∣throwne. And on the Vigill of the Purification of Saint Mary, in the Privy Cham∣ber at Westminster, be joynt consent of all the Commissioners, the aforesaid Iohn  Iohn Holt, Roger Fulthorp, William Burleigh, Iohn Locton, and Iohn Carey were displaced from their Offices, and without any further adoe arre∣sted of Treason, and by the command of the Chancelor were clapt into the Tower; and Roger Carleton in the place of Belknap, Walter Clapton in the place of Tressilian, were constituted. The great Parliament began the second of February following, in this manner: All the Peeres, as well of the Spiritualty as of the Temporalty, being assembled in the great Hall at Westminster, the King soone after came and sate downe in his Throne; and after him appeared the five Noblemen Appel∣lants, (the fame of whose admired worth ecchoed through all the Land) en∣tred the House in their costly robes, leading one another hand in hand, with an innumerable company following them; and beholding where the King sate, all at once, with submissive gestures they reverenced the King. Brambre was taken a little before, and cast into the Gaole of Gloucester. The Clergy then placing themselves on the right hand, and the Nobility on the left hand of the King, according to the ancient custome of the High Court of Parliament; the Lord Chancelor standing with his back toward the King, by the Kings command declared the cause of their summons to the Parlia∣ment: which being ended, the five aforesaid Appellants arising, declared their aforesaid Appellation by the mouth of Robert Pleasington their Speaker, who thus spake: Behold, the Duke of Gloucester comes to purge himselfe of trea∣sons which are laid to his charge by the conspirators. To whom the Lord Chancelor, by the command of the King answered: My Lord Duke, the King conceiveth so honourably of you, that he cannot be induced to beleeve, that you, who are of affinity to him in a collaterall line, should attempt any treason against his sacred Majesty. The Duke with his foure Companions, upon their knees humbly gave thankes to the King for his gracious opinion of their fi∣delity. Then after silence proclaimed, they arose, and delivered in certain Ar∣ticles in writing, wherein were contained the particularity of the Treason. When the Articles were read, the Appellants requested the King, that sen∣tence of condemnation might be given against the Conspirators, and they to receive the guerdon of their deserts; which the King promised to grant. And when the third day came of their proceedings against the Conspira∣tors, the Lord Chancelor in the name of the Clergy, in open Parliament made an Oration, shewing that they could not by any meanes be present at the proceeding, whereas there is any censure of death to be passed. For
the confirmation whereof, they delivered in a Protestation, which being read, they spake, That neither in respect of any favour, nor for feare of any mans hate, nor in hope of any reward, they did desire to absent themselves; but onely that they were bound by the Canon not to bee present at any mans arraignment or condemnation. They likewise sent their Protestation to the Chappell of the Abbey, where the Commons sate; which was allowed of. And then, when the Appellants called for justice against the Conspirators, the Lords of the Spiritualty arose, and went into the Kings Chamber neere adjoyning. But the King being moved in conscience, and in charity, perceiving that in every worke they are to remember the end; and being willing (contrary to the rigour of the Law) to favour rather these that were guilty, then the actors in that Treason, if they were able to alledge any thing in their defence caused the Processe to cease: but the Peeres (being earnest) requested, That no businesse past, present, or to come, might be debated, untill this Treason were adjudged; to which Petition the King graciously granted his as∣sent. On the 11. day of February, when nothing could be alledged, nor no wit∣nesse produced, in justification of the conspirators, but that the definitive sentence of Condemnation must be pronounced against them, the aforesaid Iohn Devoreux, Marshall of the Court, and for that time the Kings Lieutenant, adjudged them this heavie doome; That the said Archbishop of York, Duke of Ireland, Earle of Suffolke, Tressilian, and Brambre, should be drawne from the Tower to Tyborne, and there to bee hanged upon a Gibbet untill they were dead, and all their Lands and Goods to be confiscated, that none of their posterity might be by them any way enriched. On the 12. day of February, which was the first day of Shrovetide, Nicho∣las Brambre appeared in Parliament; and being charged with the aforesaid Articles of Treason, he craved favour to advise of Counsell learned, and some longer time for his more full answer to his accusation: But the Judges char∣ged him to answer severally to every point in the Articles contained: where∣unto Brambre answered, Whosoever hath branded me with this ignomini∣ous marke, with him I am ready to fight in the Lists, to maintaine my inno∣cency, whensoever the King shall appoint. The Appellants hearing this couragious challenge, with resolute counte∣nance answered, That they would willingly accept of the Combat, and there∣upon flung downe their Gages before the King; and on a sudden the whole company of Lords, Knights, Esquires, and Commons, flung downe their Gages so thicke, that they seemed like Snow in a Winters day, crying out. We also will accept of the Combat, and will prove these Articles to be true to thy head, most damnable Traytor, and so they departed for that day.
And although the Appellants were not idle in the night, yet on the next day, to aggravate their Appellation against the Conspira ors, there came di∣vers companies of the City of London, complaining of the manifold inju∣ries they had suffered by Brambre, and other Extortions and Exactions where∣with they had beene daily charged. But before they proceed with his tryall, they were stayed by most unfor∣tunate Tressilian, who being got upon the top of an house adjoyning to the Palace, and had descended into a gutter onely to looke about him, hee was discovered by certaine of the Peeres, who presently sent some of the Guard to apprehend him, who entring into the house where hee was, and having spent long time in vaine in looking for him, at length one of the Guard stept to the Master of the house, and taking him by the shoulder, with his dagger drawne, thus said, Shew us where thou hast hid Tressilian, or else re∣solve thy dayes are accomplished: the Master trembled, ready to yeeld up the ghost for fare, answered, Yonder is the place where he lyes, and shews him a round Table covered with branches of Bay, under which Tressilian lay close covered; when they had found him, they drew him out by the heeles, wondring to see him, as Vipers use, to weare his head and beard o're-grown, with old clowted shooes, and patched hose, more like a miserable poore beg∣gar, then a Judge. Tressilian being come into the Hall, was asked what he could say for him∣selfe, why judgement should not passe upon him for his treason so often com∣mitted, he became as one that had beene strucke dumbe, and his heart was as it were hardned to the very last, and would not confesse himselfe guilty of any thing: And for this cause the Parliament arose, deferring Brambres try∣all till the next day. But Tressilian was without delay led to the Tower, that he might suffer the execution of the sentence passed against him. Immediately Tressilian is upon a hurdle, and drawne thorow the streets of the City, with a wonderfull concourse of people following him, at every furlongs end he was suffered to stand still to rest himselfe, and to see if hee would confesse and report himselfe of any thing, but what hee said to the Fryer his Confessor is not knowne, neither am I able to search it out; when he came to the place of execution hee would not climbe the Ladder, untill such time as being soundly beaten with bats and staves, he was forced to goe up, and when he was up, he said, so long as I doe weare any thing upon me I shall not dye, wherefore the Executioner stripped him, and found certaine Images painted like to the signes of Heaven, and the head of a Devill pain∣ted, and the names of many of the Devils wrote in parchment, the exorci∣sing toyes being taken away, and he was hanged up naked, and because the spectators should bee certainly assured that hee was dead, they cut his throat, and because the night approached, they let him hang untill the next
morning, and then his wife having obtained a licence of the King, tooke downe his body and carried it to the Grey-Fryers, where it was buried. On the morow sentence was likewise pronounced against Brambre, who being drawne upon a hurdle from the Tower to Tyborne thorow the City, shewed himselfe very penitent, humbly craving mercy and forgivenesse at the hands of God and men, whom he had so grievously offended, and whom he had so injuriously wronged in time past, and did earnestly desire them all to pray for him; when the rope was about his necke ready to be turned off, a certaine young man, the sonne of one Northampton, asked if he had done justice to his Father or not, for Northampton was sometimes Maior of the City of London more wealthy and more substantiall then any else in the City, him did Brambre & Tresilian accuse of Treason and Conspiracie against the State, and condem∣ned him to die, being dispoiled of his estate, he himself at length hardly escaped, to whom Brambre answered and confessed with bitter tears that what he did was most vile and wicked, and with an intent onely to murder and overthrow the said Northampton, for which craving pardon of the young man being suddenly turned off, and the Executioner cutting his throat, he dyed. These men being dispatched, the Parliament discontinued their procee∣dings against the rest of the Conspirators till a more convenient time, and tooke into their considerations other more weighty affaires of the weale publicke, they made the Earle of Arundell Lord Admirall, giving him autho∣rity to resist and to repulse either by Sea or Land the enemies of the Crowne wheresoever he should inde them. And it was further agreed on, that for the appeasing of all private discon∣tents (if any were) the King and the rest of the Appellants with the rest of the Commissioners should dine together in the great Hall, which they did, and there was great joy at this reconciliation throw all the Kingdome. When these things were concluded, they then began this arraignment of the Traytors, whereupon John Blake and Thomas Vske were indicted on the fourth day of March, who although they were men of inferiout quality, yet were they found to be parties in the said Treason; Vske was a Sergeant at Armes, and was indicted amongst the Conspirators, so that being late made Sheriffe of Middlesex he had indicted the five Appellants and the Commissi∣oners as Traytors, and Blake was an Intelligencer of Tresilians, one that used to goe and come between the Conspirators, and relate the state and successe of the treason from one to another. And when they could say nothing to prove themselves cleare, sentence was pronounced upon them as their Masters were before them, they were carried to the Tower, and from thence were dragged at the horse tayle to Tyborne, and there hanged. But Vske obtained this favour, that his head was cut off after he was han∣ged
and set aloft upon Newgate for Fowles of the aire to take repast. On the sixth day of March there were called to answer, Robert Belknap, John Holt, Roger Falthorpe, William Burleigh, John Locton, and John Carey Ba∣ron of the Exchequer for their conspiracie against the Commissioners at Nottingham, but because it is not needfull to rehearse every part of their in∣dictment, they were all condemned like as the rest. Whilst the Peeres were trying them, the Clergie were retired into the Kings Chambers, but when word was brought to them of the condemnation of the Judges, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Winchester, the Chancellor, the Treasurer, Lord Keeper of the Privie Seale arose hastily and went into the Parliament House, powring forth their complaints before the King and the Peeres humbly upon their knees, beseeching them for the love of God, the Virgin Mary, and of all the Saints, even as they hoped to have mercy at the day of Judgement, they should shew favour, and not put to death the said Judges then present, and bitterly bewayling their iniquities in whose hearts the very life, soule, and spirit of our English Lawes lived, flourished and appeared, and there appeared great sorrow both on the one part of the Complainants and also of the Defendants. The Duke of Gloucester, likewise with the Earles of Arundel, Warwicke, Nottingham, and Derby, whose hearts began to be mollified, and joyned with them in their latnentable Petition. At length upon the intercession of the Clergie, the execution upon the persons was ceased, and their lives were granted them, but were sent to the Tower to be kept close prisoners. On the twelfth of March, being Thursday, it happened that the afore∣said Knights, Simon de Burleigh, John de Beauchamy, James Baroverse, and John Salesbury were brought into the Parliament House where their accusations was read, proved, they found guilty, and not any way able to cleare them∣selves. From this day almost till the Ascension of our Lord, the Parliament House was only taken up with the tryall of Sir Symon Burleygh, for three Appel∣lants, viz. The Duke of Glocester, the Earles of Arundel and Warwick, with the whole House of Commons, urged that execution might be performed ac∣cording to the Law: and on the other side, the King and Queen, the Earles of Darby and Nottingham, and the Prior of Saint John his Uncle, with the major part of the upper House, did labour to have him saved. There was also some muttering amongst the common people, and it was reported to the Parliament that the Commons did rise in divers parts of the Realm, but especially about Kent, in favour of the said Sir Simon Burleigh, which when they heard those that before spake and stood for him, now flew clean from him, and by joynt consent on the fifth day of May, sentence was
pronounced only against the said Sir Simon, that he should be drawne from the Tower to Tyborne, and then to be hanged till he were dead, and then to have his head strooke from his body. But because he was a Knight of the Gaiter, a gallant Courtier. powerfull, and once a Favourite of the Kings, and much respected of all the Court, the King of his speciall Grace, was pleased to mittigate his doome, that he should only be led to Tower-hill, and there be beheaded. On the twelfth of May, the Thursday before Whitsontide, in like manner were condemned John Beuchamp Steward of the houshold to the King, James Bereverous, and John Salsbury Knights, Gentlemen of the privie Chamber, whereof the two first, viz. John Beuchamp, and James Bereverous were behea∣ded on Tower-hill, but John Salsbury was drawne from Tower-hill to Ty∣borne, and there was hanged. On the same day also, was condemned the Bishop of Chichester the Kings Confessor, but because of his great dignity, he was pardoned. And also concerning the translation of some Bishops, because Pope Vrban the sixth, after it came to his ears, that the Archbishop of York was condem∣ned to avoid all hope of Irregularity, he created him Archbishop of S. Andrews in Scotland: which Archbishop was under the power of Scots, enemies to the Crown; and in the gift of the Arch-Pope: and because the Pope did chalenge halfe the title of all England to maintaine his wars, but although he craved it, yet he was denied: therefore he dealt warily and craftily; hoping to make up his mouth by the translation of Bishops: the Bishop of Fly then Lord Chan∣cellor, was made Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Dublin succeeded in his place; the Bishop of Bath and Wells in his place: the Bishop of Sarum in his place, and the Lord John of Waltham Lord-keeper of the privie Seale in his place; and this by his translation of Bishops he gained himself much money, according to the laws of the Canon; and when this came to the ears of the Parliament, that such a sum of money should be transported out of the Land, they strove what they could to hinder it, but could not, because the Clergie gave their consent. On the last day of May, the King appointed both Houses to meet at Kee∣mington whereas they made a conclusion of all the trialls of the said treason, granting license to Thomas Trenet, William Ellingham, and Nicholas Nagworth Knights, Richard Metford, Iohn Slake, Iohn Lincolne, Clerkes to put in bail pro∣vided they were sufficient, and to go into a place of England where they li∣sted, without any let or hindrance of any of the Kings Officers. Moreover, the six Justices, with the Bishop of Chichester, who stood condemned with them, were sent into Ireland, there to remain for a tearm of life, & thus they were di∣vided, viz. Rob. Belknap & Iohn Holr in the Village of Dromore in Ireland, not to remain as Justices or any officers, but live as banished offenders, not to
be out of Towne above the space of two miles upon paine of death? but the King out of his gracious bounty was pleased to give a yearly annuity of 40. pound to Robert Belknap, of twenty markes to Iohn Holt, during their lives; and to Roger Fulthrope the King allowed forty pound, and to William Bur∣leigh forty pound during life, confining them to the City of Dublin, granting Burleigh the liberty of two miles, and to Fulthrope three miles for their re∣creation, John Carey and John Locton with the yearly allowance of twenty pound during life, are confined to the Towne of Waterford with the like li∣berty, and the like penalty; And the Bishop of Chichester is likewise sent to Corke, there to remaine with some allowance, and the like penalty. On the third day of June, which was the last day of the Parliament, the King, the Queen, the Peeres of both Estates with the Commons, came to the Abbey at Westminster, whereas the Bishop of London, because it was his Diocesse sung Masse, and the Masse being ended, the Archbishop of Canterbu∣ry made an Oration concerning the forme and danger of the Oath, which be∣ing, although the Peers and Commons had taken the Oath of Allegiance, and homage to the King, yet because the King was young when they tooke Oath anew (as at the first) at his Coronation. These Ceremonies being performed, the Metropolitan of England with all his Suffragans there present, having lighted a Candle, and putting it under a stoole, put it out, thereby excommunicating all such as should seeme to di∣staste, dislike or contradict any of the fore passed Acts in the last Parliament; And the Lord Chancellor by the Kings appointment, caused all that were present to sweare to keep the said Statutes inviolably whole, and undissolved, as good and faithfull Liege-people of the Kings, and the forme of the Par∣liament was observed throughout all the Realme. On the morrow, which was the fourth day of June, many courteous falu∣tations and congratulations having passed betweene the King, the Nobili∣ty, and Communalty, the Parliament was dissolved, and every man returned home. And now let England rejoyce in Christ, for the net which was laid so cun∣ningly for our destruction, is broken asunder, and we are delivered. To God be the praise for all. This Parliament begunne at Westminster 1386. in the tenth yeare of the reigne of King Richard the second. FINIS.
