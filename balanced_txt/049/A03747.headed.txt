CAllophisus, being brought by the greatest perfection in an other to the smallest liberty in himselfe, hauing the foundation of his choice so firme as it cannot decaye, and finding the place of his im∣prisonment so stronge as he cannot escape: wilbe at the Tilts ende vp∣on the two and twentie day of Ianuarie next ensewing, at one of the Clocke in the afternoone, there to defend and mainetayne against all men whosoeuer, for sixe courses a peece, the whole sixe, or any of the sixe Articles which fol∣low, whereunto he challengeth all, that either Honnor any Lady, whom they may bragge of for any woorth: or serue a Mistresse, which hath reason to boast of her selfe for any beautie, by these first three Articles. 1 The fyrst, that his Mistresse is for Beautie of her face, and the Grace of her person, the moste per∣fect creature, that euer either the eye of man hath beheld, the Arte of Nature hath framed, or the com∣passe of the earth hath enioyed. 2 The second, that it is as impossible for any other whosoeuer, to abide the beames of his Mistresse looke, as for the Clowdes to endure the shining and appearing of the Sunne, and that the one dooth not sooner vanish at the shewing of the Sunne, then the other will sodenly fade at the presence of his Mistresse, 3 The thirde, that the perfections of his Mistresse, are in number so infynite, in quality so excel∣lent, and in operation so effectuall, as she by the helpe of them, and they by the direction of her, doo make more men without liberty, and more bodyes without harts, then any, or all the women in the world besides. And because Callophisus douteth that the taking vppon him a quarell which is so iust on his syde, will make that he shall haue none to defend the contrary against him, and that the woorthynesse of his mistresse will steale away the Seruaunts of other Ladyes, he will with one onely assistaunt, challenge all that either haue opinion in the constancy of theyr looue, or assuraunce in the greatnes of their affection, by these other three Articles. 4 The fyrst, that Callophisus for his faith will yeelde to none, and for his loyalty dooth thinke himselfe abooue all, and in these two respects pronounceth himselfe moste woorthy to be accepted into fauor with his Mistresse▪ or to receiue grace at the hands of the fayrest. 5 The second, that the good will and affection of Callophisus to his Mistresse, is for impression so deepe, for continuaunce so lasting, and for passion so extreame, as it is impossible for any other to carry so perfect looue, or to conceaue the like affection. 6 The thyrde, that those aduentures and hazards, which cannot but be moste sower, to any other for the pleasing of any Lady (whom they Honour) are moste sweete vnto him, for the contentment of the Mistresse whom he serueth. And if they neither will contend with him for the superioritie of his Mistresse in woorthy∣nesse, nor for the prerogatiue of himselfe in affection, hauing not theyr iudgement vayled with so perciall an humor as may leade them to resist of manifest and open trueth, and doubting a bad successe in a wrong opinion, because Veritas vincet omnia, then will he, & his sayd assistant, with all such, runne sixe courses, to ioyne with them in honouring of his Mistresse, which hath no equall, and expressing of his affection which cannot be matched. WHereas this challenge of Justes, was signifyed by way of deuise before her Maiestie, on Twelfe night last past, to haue been performed the fifteenth daye of Ianuarie, her Maiesties pleasure is for diuers considerations, that it be deferred vntill the two and twenty of the same moneth, and then to be held at Westminster, the accustomed place. Proclaimed by the sound of Trumpet, and a Herauld. Imprinted at London by Iohn Charlewood.
