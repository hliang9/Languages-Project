And whereas the greatest number of the workmen and other per∣sons imployed in the trades aforesaid are soe very pore and nedy, and of meane condition as no pecuniary mulct can take hold of them, and likewise so rude and disordered as noe or∣dinary or ciuill censure can moue them to yeelde obedience to rule or gouernment. And therefore some sharpe and se∣uere coertion and constraint must necessarily be vsed towards them in many cases. Therefore our will and pleasure is, and wee doe by these presentes will and ordaine: That if any per∣son
or persons now vsing, or which shall hereafter vse or ex∣ercise, within the said realme of England, or dominion of Wales, the said Art, Trade, or Mistery of Ship-wrights, or other the workes or trades aforesaid shall obstinately resist and withstand the gouernment of the said Maister, Wardens and Assistants, or their lawfull deputy or deputies, and shall after admonition and warning giuen vnto them, or any of them in that behalfe wilfully persist in such disobedient course either by deceitfull working or by vnlawfull departure from, after they haue bene hired, or within the time or times of their retainor, or shall by combination, conspiracies, or o∣ther vnlawfull practises, seeke to ouerthrow, destroy, and bring into contempt the powers, preuiledges, and authori∣ties by these presents giuen and granted to the said Maister, Wardens, and Cominalty, and their successors for the vni∣uersall benifit and good of our said Realme, dominion and subiects.

And for so much, as a great part of the said Art or Mystery are continually for the most part imploied, and attendant vpon the seruice and nauigati∣on of vs our heires and successors. We therefore of our espe∣ciall grace, doe will and grant for vs our heires and succes∣sors. That the saide Maister, Wardens and Cominalty, or any of them, or their, or any of their successors shall not at any time or times hereafter be informed, put, placed, or im∣pannelled in or vpon any Assizes, Iuries, Inquests, or at∣taintes whatsoeuer,Freedome from Size or Sessions before any Iudges, Iustices, or Com∣missioners of vs, our heires or successors out of the Citties, Townes, Boroughs, Parishes or places where they or any of them doe or shall happen to dwell, vnlesse they haue lands or tenements lying out of the said Citties, Townes, Bo∣roughs, Parishes or places, by reason whereof they or any of
them ought to be charged, nor shall at any time be pressed or inforced to serue vs our heires or successors as Land-soldi∣ers, but doe absolutely and freely discharge them and euery of them from any such seruice and attendance. And wee doe further by these presents, for vs our heires and successors straightly charge and commaund all and euery Sheriffes, Bai∣liffes, and other officers of vs our heires and successors that they & every of them doe from time to time forbeare to put or impanel any of the said Maister, Wardens, and Cominal∣ty, or any their deputies or apprentises, in or vpon any such Iuries, or inquests as is aforesaid, contrary to our said mean∣ing & intent, vpon paine of our displeasure, & of such paines, penalties, and imprisonments as by the lawes of this our Realme can or may be inflicted or imposed vpon them or any of them for their contempt, in doing contrary to our royall pleasure and commandment in that behalfe. And whereas the Master, Wardens, and Cominalty of the said Art or Mis∣tery of Ship-wrights of Redrith aforesaid, and their and euery of their deputies and apprentises being continually for the most part charged and chargeable to be ready and prouided at an howers warning vpon diuers seruices and imployments as well at the Sea, for the necessity, defence, and safety of our realmes and kingdomes, and for the use and imployment of our Marchants for continuance and increase of trade and commerce with forraine Nations, for the benefit and pro∣fit of vs and our subiects, as also to giue attendance within our Kingdomes for the new building, repairing, and trim∣ing as well of the Shippes, Pinnaces, and vessels of vs, our heires & successors, as also of the Ships Pinnaces, and vessels of our Marchants and subiects. Therefore our will and plea∣sure is. That if it shall hapen the said Maister, Wardens, and Comminalty, or other persons, which by the true intent and meaning hereof are and ought to be discharged from such seruice vpon Iuries or Inqests, shall by Sheriffes, Bailiffes or other officers, ignorantly or wilfully be put and impan∣nelled to serue vpon Iuries, and Enquests, contrary to our
true intent and meaning, in that behalfe, in certaine our for¦mer Letters Pattents graunted, and also in these presents re¦nued. And that any of the said persons beeing absent from their houses, and places of habitation, at such times as they were, or shall bee sommoned or warned to appeare vpon a∣ny such Iuries or enquests, could not, nor cannot plead or alleadge the said former Letters Pattents nor these presents, or the priueledges and authorities hereby giuen and granted vnto them, for their discharge in that behalfe, whereby di∣uers issues, fines, and amercements are many times retur∣ned against them, contrary to our true intent and meaning: Wee doe therefore graunt for vs, our heires and successors, vn∣to the said Master, Wardens, and Comminalty, and their suc∣cessors for euer: That if any issues, fines, and amercements shall be returned, forfeited or imposed by, or vppon any of the said person or persons of the said Corporation, Trade, Art, or Mistery, for or in respect of not doing, or not performing of any of the said seruices or other things whereof they are hereby exempted or freed, or mentioned to be exempted or freed: That then the same person or persons, his, or their heires, executors, administrators and assignes and euery of them, and all his and their landes, tenements, goods, and chattels shall be for euer freed and discharged of and from the same issues, fines, and amerciaments, and euery of them. And wee doe require and commaund the Barons of our Es∣chequer that in respect of the pouerty of many that are to be releeued in this case, they giue them all expedition and ease in the proceedings and pleading for their discharge in that behalfe.Submissi∣on to the Charter. And because this Corporation of Ship-wrights hath bin principally instituted & made for the mainteinance and encrease of Nauigation and for the better and more sub∣stantiall making, building and repairing of ships, and also for the trayning vp & instructing of Ship-wrights, Ship-carpen∣ters, labourers, and workemen to make them more ready, able and skilfull for seruice, All which things do very greatly con∣cerne the defence, safety, wealth and profit of our selfe, our
Kingdomes and subiects. Therefore wee doe not onely straightly charge and command all and euery person and per∣sons which are or shall be of the Cominaltie of this Corpo∣ration.

And forasmuch as the pouertie of Ship-wrights and persons belonging to the said Cor∣poration is now much more increased then in former times, and not able to be releeued, supported and maintained, by the duties and reuenues of the said Corporation which heertofore they haue had, or were enabled to haue, being so small in yeerely value.Power to purchase.
