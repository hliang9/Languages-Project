The Fife mde warlike melody, The ensignes were displaied: Oh either side they curredge cride. The king was not dismaied. But like a Souldiour and a king, A standard he did take: And slew the man that bare the same, Which made his enemies quake. Let canons rore and Muskets shoote &c. The Duke de Maine for all his power. Was forste from field to flie: His heeles were better then his hands, He fought so valiauntly. His power was stricken with such feare, That they did flie in haste: Whereby the king did win the field, His enemies were disgraste. Let canons rore and Muskets shoote &c. He and his power did follow them, Full fiue howres in the chase: From eight at morne til toward night. He fought in the enemies face. This victory he did obtaine, Such was his good succes, And many thousand enimies slaine, Report saieth sure no les. Let canons rore and Muskets shoote &c. What tents and furniture for warre, What treasure and iewels rich: Hereby the king and soldiours got, You may suppose was miche. And prisoners taken of account, As you shal: shortly heere, VVho for their reason to their king, I thinke will pay full deere. Let canons rore and Muskets shoote &c. See here the handy worke of God, VVho harmles saude the king. And sent him treasure in great store, And euery warlike thing.
