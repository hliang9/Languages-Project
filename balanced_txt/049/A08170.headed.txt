A NEW SVRVEY OF THE AFFAIRES of EVROPE. WITH Other remarkable accidents, not yet published by the ordinary Posts, but faithfully collected out of Letters of credit and good Relations. LONDON, Printed for Nathaniel Butter, Bartholomew Downes, and Thomas Archer. 1623.
From Constantinople. WHereas you haue a long time expected some relation of newes, and discourses con∣cerning the affaires of Europe; alas, you must consider what you doe, when you come into a well furnished Garden, you see the frost and the snow hath nipped the flowers, and there is scarce any ap∣pearance either of sweet herbes or flourishing plants: only the roots remaine safe in the ground, and peraduenture at the spring through the warmth of the Sunne, and the nature of the soile assume as it were new life, and shew forth some beautifull hansomnesse, so hath the winter delt with the affaires of Europe, the Souldiers haue beene glad of refreshing, and the Princes taken care to make them strong with ease and quietnesse, but now the Spring comming for∣ward, and the storme of cold ouer-blowne, you shall see peraduenture the roots to receiue a strange freshnesse, and new businesse, shew you a face both of terrour and pleasure: till when I will be bold to vnseale certaine Letters which shall tell you of certaine well manured grounds, which euen this winter haue brought forth
some flowers, and simple although they proue Antipathies in nature to some constitutions: the Letters then from Constantinople assure vs thus much, that whereas Daout Bashaw, the setter vp of Mustapha, after the strangling of Osman, who had married one of the daughters of the Empresse, proiected not onely the gouerne∣ment of the Empire, but the ouerruling of the Emperour: yea peraduenture the aduancing of his posterity to the throne of Othoman, by foi∣sting in a sonne of his own, and then to strangle the yong brothers of Osman, and so to follow with the death of Mustapha. The new Viceer, called Huzein Bashaw, comming from Gran Cairo, as a giuer of Antidotes to the poison of these turmoiles, had no better meanes to ad∣nance the frame of his greatnesse, then to call Daout Bashaw & the Empresse in question for so perfidious a plot, and dangerous a treason: The woman either transformed her selfe, and so was obscured: or corrupted the Officers of State, & so was remitted; or confessed all to the princi∣pall Mufty, and so was pardoned. But the Ba∣shaw, the Ianisaries not enduring his Apology, was presently cut in pieces: so that Mustapha after many changes is now in the hands of Hu∣zein Bashaw, who taking example by the for∣mer affrightings, hideth as yet his panther ta∣ients of policy concerning the augmentation of his owne honour, and falleth directly to the
setting vpright the staggering Common-wealth, and adding as it were a tincture to the beauty of the Othoman glory, wherein he hath proceeded in such a manner, and with so rare a discipline, that when hee sacrificed as it were 200. Ianisaries, who had beene delinquents in the murther to the ghost of Osman, all the rest endured the punishment and gaue a plaudit to his loyalty. Mustapha in the meane time sits like a shadow, and is glad of the peace which Huzein Bashaws gouernment hath established, louing him because he hath effected the obser∣uation of the Souldiers toward him, and fearing himselfe because he hath already seene what the malignity of time hath done, and the insolent Souldier is ready to put in practice. For euen the other day when the people were distasted with Mustaphus pusillanimity, and re∣membred the heroicke sprightfulnesse of mur∣thered Osman, when they heard of the tumults of Asia, and the suspicious reuolts of the Ba∣shawes of Aleppo and Babylon, when some had whispered in their eares, O what a difference is there betweene the magnanimous countenance and maiesticall presence of Osman, and the de∣iected aspect of Mustapha, who men would iudge to be fitter for a Monastry then a Palace; or to pray in a Cel rather then rule in a Throne: they suddenly called for the sight of Osmans brethren, who very politikely without any delay
Huzein Bashaw brought out of the Serali, and aduanced in the Hippodrame, assuring the souldiers, that neither it was Mustaphaes pleasure, nor any motiues of Superiours, ei∣ther to obscure them or disappoint them: onely there was reason by no meanes to dis∣locate Mustapha now raigning, considering their young yeeres, and the suspitious trou∣bles of the confining Princes. For if any new tumults should arise out of the aduan∣tages of disorder, God knowes what the Persian might doe in Asia and Arabia, and the Emperour and King of Poland in Hun∣gary and Transiluania, considering they had al∣ready thriued against their enemies on euery side: therefore he commanded them to qui∣etnesse and silence, and demand of him an account of the Princes, when occasion should serue. In this manner was his wisdome so sea∣sonable, that the flames of this new sedition were delicately quenched: the Princes retur∣ned to the pallace: Mustapha established in the Throne, himselfe preuailed with their good opinion, and the whole body of the Ianizaries recouered from the growing infection of re∣uolts and disorder, so that the city was sud∣denly quieted, and all good gouernement obserued. Much about this time, which was in Octo∣ber last, some will haue the Persian Embassa∣dor
to ariue; as well to gratefie the new enthro∣nized Mustapha, as to renew the old and cu∣stomary treaties of peace: some againe say there was no new Embassador, but that the Ligier there, had seuerall directions from Per∣sia, both to present the Emperor certaine gifts, and to gratefie the Viceer for his indulgent care ouer the Common-wealth, in so dange∣rous and suspitious times of innouation. And also to associate himselfe with the English Em∣bassador, and present him with a Target of gold, and other gifts in behalfe of the Sophy his Lord, and by reason of the seruices, the English had done him at Ormus, who there∣upon tooke a conuenient time, and by way of Visitation came vnto him, vsing these or the like speeches. My Lord I am commissioned from my great Master, The Persian Ambassador to the English Ambassador. the Sophy of Persia, not onely to visit you, but gratefie you with such presents as befitteth him to bestow, and you to receiue: the motiues arising from the high deseruings of your nation, and the noble renoune of your Prince: For if Marchants or if you please Marchants Factors, can merit so well of fame, as to equall great Commanders in heroick acti∣ons, what doe the Nobles and Gentiles deserue, who questionlesse giue good example to the rest, and cannot but reioyce the kings heart to
haue such subiects, and worthy souldiers: but to the purpose. The trafficke of silke being long since setled at Ormus, the Portingalls pos∣sessing certaine places about Iasques, on the Easterne side of the Persian Gulph, and chal∣lenged by the great Mogull of the hither India, not only debarred all commers as men say, but by extraordinary meanes, and force surprised the Castle, and Iland of Ormus: which when my great Lord vnderstood after mature con∣fideration, as vnwilling to endure the indigni∣ty, besides the losse of his prerogatiues and customes, hee capitulated with the English, and vpon certaine conditions by way of salary entertainement, admitted them to his seruice, and committed the managing of the affaires to their endeuours; so an army was prepared, but because the Castle could not be obtained, nor the Iland cleered without great Ordnance, and that the English ships lay so conueniently in the Gulph, hee likewise hired their Ord∣nance, and after many skirmishes, time and their owne valour, mounted two hundred peeces, and banded three hundred men, who demea∣ned themselues so valiantly, and bestowed their shot so effectually, that by degrees wee were Lords of the Iland, and absolute Masters of the towne; the Portingals not able to endure the encounters, nor braue assaults without losse and some slaughters.
Thus by degrees they won the Iland, and ex∣pulsed the Portugals out of the Towne, nothing remaining but the fortified Castle, which was de∣tained but a while; for the defendants foreseeing an vtter destruction by holding out, considering our Persians were euery where so malitious and violent against them, gained the sauing of their liues by orderly composition, and so quite aban∣doned the place, and we were quickly masters of all; which without flattery or other insinuation, it pleaseth my great Master to attribute to the wis∣dome and vnmatchable valour of the English, and for which he hath recompenced euery man accor∣ding to his deseruing, and is contented that the trafficke for Silke shal remaine free to the English, and halfe the customes of the Towne and Iland of Ormus be as it were a yeerely compensation to the East India Company at your City of London. And thus much for Constantinople. From Poland. You haue often heard how the Tartars and Cossacks of Bogdonia and Poland liue for the most part vpon spoile and robberies of Merchants, ex∣cept the wars imploy them, or they imploy them∣selues to the seruices of other Princes, which cu∣stome it seemes they still retain: for euen the other day as bad men (though enemies) soone agree to commit outrages, & any villanie to enrich them∣selues: so did they combine to forrage into Russia, and went so farre, and preuailed so well, that if an embucy from Mosio had not acquainted King Si∣gismond
with the mischiefe and forcible attempts they had questionlesse kindled a fire which a great deale of water could not haue quenched: but thus disappointed at that time, and vnderstanding of a truce and limited peace betweene the King of Po∣land and King of Sweden, and that also the Empe∣rour of Germany, though there were great prepa∣rations for warre, was vnwilling to entertaine them, or to indure their vnrulinesse either in Hun∣gary or Bohemia, they went another way to worke, and concluded with the Tartars to lay a Plot vp∣on the City of Leopolis, which being discouered by certaine poore Pedlars men and women of the same trade the Inhabitants preuented. For vn∣derstanding of their abode and places of associati∣on, they made a braue sally, and by the assistance of the Villages, not onely dissipated their meetings and disappointed their pretended villany, but put diuers of them to the sword, and by many fearfull slaughters compelled them out of those Confines, so that they were enforced to hide themselues in the woods, and flie to the borders of the blacke Sea. From Transiluania. AS after great windes and fearefull tempests, though the ayre is calme, and they seeme ap∣peased, the Sea yet remaines turbulent, and the billowes mount a great while: so fared it with the
businesse and affayres of Turky, though the Citie was quieted, and the Ianizaries seemed appeased, yet euery man was almost affrighted, and the whis∣pering Troops amased the Bashawes, as if the con∣fining Princes were vp in armes, not onely to take reuenge, as acting one anothers part on such tray∣tors as durst lay hands vpon their Prince, and such a Monarch; but to worke their owne ends for such places, and recouery of such Countries, as the Turkes had vsurped both in Persia and Chri∣stendome. Wherupon the Vizier Hazein Basshaw by way of preuention very cautelous demeaned himselfe, and in the name of his Emperour Mustapha sent out his seuerall Ambassadors for the renouation of those ancient contracts & conditions of peace betweene the Princes of Asia and Europe, and yet retayning the maiesty of the Othoman glory, hee insinuated with none, but the Persian, and Empe∣rour of Germany: onely hee laid a strict command vpon the Basshawes of the Prouinces, both to maintaine the dignity of the Common-wealth, and the peace of the Cities. Among whom the Ambassador that came to the Emperour, not onely obtayned a resolute combi∣nation of peace, but a faire admission of amitie, in∣somuch that the Transiluanian Prince had a relax∣ation of his tribute, and augmentation of his go∣uernment, so that hee thought it meet to com∣pound with the Emperour, that he might the bet∣ter preuent the incursions and abuses of the Iani∣zaries, if they should in this turbulent time either
breake into Hungary, or trouble his owne Coun∣try: but the Basshaw of Buda being as carefull as himselfe, had alwayes preparations ready, both to intercept the malignity of time, concerning his own rebels, and the terror of trouble from the Cof∣sacks of Poland: in all which he was countenanced by the Emperor, and emboldned through this new combination of peace betweene the Empe∣rour and the great Turke. From Vienna. THe Emperor as it were thriuing in all his de∣signes, in the acquisition of the Palatinate, and the preuailings of Bauaria, especially in the ap∣peasing of a seditious tumult in Prague, where he shewed them the power of a stronger arme, and taught them this discipline, that the end of treason was death, and punishment attended the delin∣quents against the law; seemed yet weary of ex∣tremities, and practised another way, yea diuers o∣ther waies (as I may say) to corroborate his great∣nesse, and reconcile the affaires of the Com∣monwealth. First, he proclaimed peace and qui∣ernesse to all that would returne to his obedience. Secondly, he admitted the Prince of Anholt and many Lords into his fauour; yea he repealed the proscriptions of the Marquesse of Iaggendorf, the Counts of Thorne father and sonne, and others who had maintained Glatz, and the reuolted Townes of Morauia against him; who yet stood on their guard, and kept themselues secure in their fast holds. Thirdly, hee countenanced the Prote∣stants
in Vienna and many other places, whereby they continued their assemblies, so that you shall haue 50. Coaches at a Sermon: and in Stiria, Ca∣rinthia, Corrinola, Croatia, they meet without feare or danger, yea they pray for their brethren in the Valtoline: all which he endures, and sees a great alteration by this quiet course and conniuency. Fourthly, he hath changed many gouernors both in Morauia and Silesia, and written to the Bishops to be as sparing in their authortty, as may stand with the dignity of the Romane Church. Fiftly, hee hath proclaimed diuers Diets and Assemblies at Auspurg, Regenspurg, Ratisbona, and other places, whither he hath gone with his Empresse in person, and beene entertained with triumphs, inuiting as it were the Princes of the Empire to maintaine their accustomed solemnities, and decide the pre∣sent controuersies for the rectifying the disorders of the Common-wealth. Last of all, perceiuing a kind of thinnesse in these Assemblies, and that nei∣ther Saxony, Brandenburg, Brunswicke, Hess, nor many other Princes graced the places with their presence; he caused the Empresse to write vnto the Duke of Saxony; whose Letters were to this effect: My Lord: The Empresse Letter to the Duke of Saxony. I will neither meddle with the Em∣perors affaires, nor your discontents; nay I would not haue so much liberty giuen to a woman, for feare of irregularity, especially in transcendent bu∣sinesse, and aboue the short reaches of her sex. l will onely challenge my owne rights, and take vpon me to defend the honour and prerogatiue
which belongs to my place: I had thought then that for my sake you would haue come to the Dy∣et at Regenspurg, and out of noble respects either welcomed me into the Country, or giuen good example to others by your obseruation. When I was in my Fathers house, I haue heard Gonzala boast of Saxonies loue, and although we had suffi∣cient matter to talke of your greatnesse, yet wee left all to thinke of your honor and affinity to the Emperor. How comes then this slacknesse to vi∣sit me that am Gonzalaes sister, and Ferdinandos wife? Is it because you are offended or distasted with the affaires? Come a Gods name, and leui∣ate these tumors; shew your griefes, and iustifie your Apology, and by the faith of a Princesse, whose innocency warrants your safe conduct, I will not leaue kneeling before his Imperiall Maie∣stie; nay our Ladies Altar, vntill a perfect recon∣ciliation be made, and your Honor acknowledged to be a great supportation of the Empire. From the Valtoline. It hath beene heretofore generally proclaimed that whosoeuer would obey the Church of Rome, and submit to the Spanish gouernment, should haue restauration of estates, and quietnesse of life; but many contested against it, and the preuailers turned their admonitions into fury, and ran ouer the Country with slaughter: some they beheaded & set vpon poles; some they cut out their tongues, some they punished in other manner, and some they sent into the inquisition at Millane; amongst whom as the Souldiers in their searches lighted
vpon certaine Ministers, and Noblemen and wo∣men, there was a Gentlewoman of great yeares in the rancke of our Ladies, fourescore at the least, na∣med Maddona Paola, who was at the first intrea∣ted by many perswasiue reasons to forsake her Re∣ligion and come to the vnity of the Mother Church: but her reply was the Story of the three Children, who would not kneele to Nabuchadne∣zars Image, and when they added the terror of the punishment, shee smiled in their faces and told them they should see the Angell to protect her, which answer they imputed to frenzie and the dotage of her yeares, and so all enrag'd and ex∣asperated, they reuiled her and condemned her to the fire, yea to bee burnt in a publike Piazza: so the inquisitors went cautelously to worke, and not only bound her hands but gagd her mouth, and so brought her to the stake among them all: but it should seeme the fire had quickly power of her cordes and her hands were as quickly at liberty, so that ere shee dyed shee shewed such signes of ioy & alacrity of spirit, such a liuely countenance, such clapping of her hands, such lifting them vp to heauen, such pointing to the people, and then to heauen, that ere she was confumed to cynders, the thousands of people shed as many teares, and departed a way murmurring and discontented. In this estate standeth the whole Country of the Grizons at this hower, and so by the aduice of the Swiffe, they haue implored the Maiesty of France, the Signory of Venice, the King of Denmarke, the Princes of Germany, and the States of the vnited
Prouinces, to speak cheerful things to their soules, and not to see them subiect to the authority of strangers. From Naples. AFter the arriuall of the Duke of Alua, as Viceroy, and that the Seas were filled with Gallies and Turkish Carmisans, which Hazein Bas∣shaw had sent abroad to watch the proceedings of Christian Princes in this time of turbulency on all sides: the gouernment was so searcht and looked into, and yet with that affability and insinuating care, that the mutinies and seditions formerly rai∣sed, were now appeased, the famine preuented, the Merchant welcomed, diuers Noblemen dis∣charged out of prison, the factions reconciled, ma∣ny debts payed, the money enhawnsed, and a ge∣nerall reformation followed, which once establi∣shed, then beganne a muster in Calabria, Brutia, Apuleia, yea Cicilia it selfe, and at last certaine troopes of horse and Companies listed for any new emploiment, as the directions of Spain should giue them notice: but as yet they heare of no filuer Fleet arriued: so that in truth, though ru∣mour haue beene too lauish in ouer-numbring the Souldiers: yet there is a great probability, that there shall an army be raised in Italy to attend the Duke of Feria in his proiects at Millane, where at this houre there is a great suspition of reuolting, as you shall heare in due place.
From Rome. They write from hence, that there was neuer so Wise, Honourable, and iudicious a Counsell about the Pope, as is now, nor were there Cardinals in their Conclaue so reposed, and addicted to reformation before: Insomuch that many enormities haue beene punished, and both Priests, Fryers, and Curtezans, restrained from that former iustifying of their impi∣ous liues in so publicke a manner, yea many good de∣crees haue of late beene enacted, and sundry Consti∣tutions sent abroad to be practised. 1 First, that there was a new Bull proclaymed, for auoyding all deceit and partiality in Electing their Popes. 2 Secondly, that those wonderfull fulminations against Heretickes, should not be executed with Fire and Sword in so publique a manner as was wont: in∣somuch, that whereas the most expected the Bishop of Spalato should haue beene condemned to the Fire, hee was pardoned, reconciled, and admitted to enioy his honours and substance. 3 Thirdly, Cardinall Burghesius falling out with a Iesuite, called him busie body, and tolde him to his face, that if euer the Church suffered Diminution and decay of glory, it might thanke the Iesuites, who had beene the cause of all the combustions of Europe. 4 Fourthly, that although the rotten branches of the Vine were to be broken, pruned, and cut off, yea cast into the Fire, which is meant by obstinate Here∣tickes: yet was it no Doctrine of the mother Church
to destroy innocent soules with the refractary wic∣ked, nor slaughter ignorant Nouices before admoni∣tory counsell, and aduise for their conuersion. Last of all, that the Cardinals should maintaine their eminent Dignity and places, how euer men ex∣cept against their originals. From Venice. The affaires of the Grizons ouer-clouded with so many misfortunes, drawe them from the line of Na∣ture to the meanes of preseruations, and so by the co∣adiutement of the Swisse their neighbours, they not onely acquainted their confederates with the mise∣ries, that had plunged them into the gulph of discon∣tent, but implored the assistance of many Princes to remember the Antiqua foedera, & not suffer them to be forsaken in this losse of their Liberty, and troubling of their conscience: amongst whom it is said, that one Andrea Planta was sent to the Signiory of Venice with intimation of their Estates, and imploration of their helpe, who was so well entertained, that his mes∣sage was not onely accepted, but many faire promi∣ses returned to their satisfaction: his Message had these or the like passages. The Grizons message to Venice. HIgh and Mighty: I come not to renouate your memoryes, concerning the combination be∣tweene vs, and the amitv of our Countries, nor to meddle with the cause of Religion, which of it selfe were sufficient to moue a pitty: but to plead the policies of State, and vrge an ancient position by way of Caution: Tum tuares agitur, paries cumproximus ar∣det, your Marchants cannot Traficke into Germany, and vent the commodities of your Countrey, for now
all is stopt, or blockt vp, so that you must with a vigi∣lant eye fore-see the danger to come and preuent the worst: you see what is done already, neither could the Snow of the mountaines, nor the Mountaines themselues, the passages of the Woods, the cut out∣wayes, the steepy ascendings, the plashing of the pines, the anfractus of the Hilles, the roaring of the Waters, the danger of the pits hinder them, but they are come thus farre already: They began with the Fort Fuentes, they continued with their Garrisons in many places, and now they haue ended in a manner with the possession of our whole Territories, so that if this inundation be not stopped, iudge your selues, whether it will flow, if it breake down the bankes, & if we be not relieued in time, may it not proue a rub to gall others, aswell as our selues: therefore I leaue it to your further consideration, and so without either ag∣grauating the cause, or exasperating the aduersary, I conclude, that there is no husbandry in letting these plants ouerspread the ground. To this effect was the Message of the Grizons, but their Answer was not published, onely it was whispe∣red, that if the King of France did not send the Duke de Rohan, as principall Commaunder, they would in∣uite Count Mansfeld to vndertake the busines, and be Lieutenant Generall of those Forces, which should be there imployed: in the meane while they fortefied all the maritine Townes of Histria, and Dalmatia, filled the Gulph with Gallyes, and sent two Galenzes to lye betweene the point of Calabria and Candy. From Geneua. The great resort of Noble men and women out of Germany, the Grizons and France in the time of these
troubles and persecutions to Geneua, as a sanctuary hath filled both the Towne so the Countrey, that a great dearth and famine followed, insomuch that Wheat exceeded our rates, & a Bushel is worth twen∣ty shillings sterling, whereupon the Magistrates fea∣red some greater mischiefe, as that the Duke of Sauoy would take aduantage on their distresse and pestring of people, because they heard of diuers Mustrings, and that the King of France determined to meet him at Lions: But God hath the keyes of the hearts of Princes, and openeth and shutteth them at his plea∣sure: so they heard no more of hostile inuasion, nor a word was whispered of any proiects against them, not withstanding they stood on their guard, and besides their continuall Prayers within, had as continuall Garrisons and watches without, so that withall care and diligence they fortified their Ports, and manned their Fortifications: yea such was the especiall fauour of God towards them, that all other prouision bare low prices, and for all this scarcity of Corne, their ve∣ry neighbours and aduersaries, I meane the Catholike Cantons and Bazill it selfe, supplyed their wants, and contributed money to their reliefe. From Spaine. They write from Spaine, that howeuer the Souldi∣ers in their fury haue proceeded in the Valtoline, yet haue the Inhabitants bin offered faire Conditions of Peace, & remaining in quiet possession of their estates so they will disclaime the dependancy on any other States, & acknowledge the King of Spaine their Lord and Protector: but whereas report hath sent abroad diuers Thousands of Duckets to pay the Soldiers, and discharge some Debts of importance and accompt,
the truth is, the siluer Fleet is not yet arriued, but ra∣ther is so watched by the Holanders in those parts, that they cannot make that speede as is desired, so that there is as great complaining for want of money, as euer before, notwithstanding the King not onely enlargeth his Court, but hath proceeded very nobly in diuers reformations, and set downe especiall ordi∣nances for the augmentation of his owne honour, and detention of the Subiect in modest rules of duty and obseruation, so that neither can euery man come to the Court as they were wont, nor those that come, passe to such places, as they accustomed. From Fraunce. It hath pleased God so to diuert the King from pro∣secuting the warre against his Subiects, that heere is euery where a cheerefull face of concord and amity, and we doe not heare of any man that hath opposed against the message of the Swiss and Grizons, but that the King is willing to admit of their imploration for the defence, or if you will regayning the Valtoline, for which purpose there hath beene reciprocall Em∣bassies betweene the Duke of Sauoy and him, as farre as sending of Presents, and resolution to continue a peace: but they neuer met in person, onely the Prince of Piemont and his wife haue beene at Lions, and great ioy is made on all sides for the hopes men haue to thriue in their expectation, especially considering the Archbishop of Rheimes proposeth nothing, but obe∣dience to the Church, and an Vnity in Religion, disclaiming the Iesuites, intermedling with State matters, and pestilentiall deuises, to set all in an vp∣rore againe: there hath passed diuers courtesies be∣tweene
Duke Hespernon, the Prince of Condy, the Duke of Guise, and others of that side: and the Dukes Rohan and Subiss, with the Duke of Bulloigne himselfe: as for the mustring of Souldiers, and great preparation of diuers Armies, there is no such matter as yet, more then a coniecture, that if the King will vndertake the businesse of the Grizons, it cannot be done without sufficient forces, and worthy Commaunders. From the Palatinate. The waters haue come downe so fast this Winter, that they haue remoued Tilly from Frankendale, where that worthy Sergeant Maior Borregh hath not onely defended the place, but made many sallyes to the en∣damaging the Enemy, and supplying his own wants: but as I beleeue, neither Bauaria or he hath a purpose to continue there. For they neither fortifie them∣selues, nor repaire the decayed places, or broken ram∣parts, but rather demolish such holds as may be made inexpugnable, especially the Castle at Heidelberg, and the new Sconce at Mainhem, with other places which Captaine Dexter had bestowed great paines about. The Duke of Bauarta himselfe is gone to his owne Country to meete the Emperour and Empresse, who appointed to come thether, & giue the Ambassadors of Saxony and Brandenburg audience. From Cullen. The daily forraging of the Country by the Enemy on both sides, hath raised diuers hurliburlies i Cullen, so that the Bishop hath quite abandoned the Towne, and the whole lands of Westphalia Wast, Luke, and Mank, lye exposed to the fury of the Souldiers, who spate
not to spoile both friends and foes, and although Gonzales with Graue Vanderberghen haue pretended to follow Mansfeild, and driue him out of Freesland, for which purpose they came as farre as Lingen; yet they haue smally preuailed more then common intercepti∣ons, as the troopes haue taken aduantage of one ano∣thers weakenesse lying in Garison: yet they say, that Gonzales hath surprised the Towne of Rossendorpe, be∣longing to the Hauns Townes: As for Mansfeild, hee remaineth like a rocke vnmooueable, 12000. strong, well armed, and as it should seeme resolued to prose∣cute any action or attempt. From Amsterdam. Here is great preparation of shipping both for the East and West Indies, and as great ioy for the agree∣ment betweene the States and East India Company  London. They feast one another, and haue met i their Churches with publicke prayers and thankesgi∣uing: yea, the report of the businesse at Ormus in Per∣sia, is here so frequent, and well entertained, as if they had beene sharers in the glory of the English: but be∣cause they imagine the Portingals will prouide for re∣couery in some stronger and sufficient manner, they likewise prouide by way of preuention, extraordinary ships, prouision, and Mariners for the same place and purpose, and so determine to ioyne with the English in those parts, if neede be: so that here is a iustificati∣on published, that they neither looked on in their dangerous fights, as Neuters, nor will hereafter giue way vnto any wrong or indignity, which shall be of∣fered them.
From Antwerpe. The comming downe of the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Brunswick, and Graue Henry to Breda, and so to ouer-looke Bergen with all her fortifications, which were presently to be repaired, raised a fearefull hurli∣burly in Antwerpe, as if the Towne were already besie∣ged, or some Treason discouered amongst the Inhabi∣tants, which feare of theirs was much augmented by the many Ships in a readinesse at the mouth of the Scheld, where the Prince of Orenge lost some of them, and diuers horses by an vnlookt for Frost, and so the breaking of the Ice vpon a suddaine: whereupon Spi∣nola and his Captaines taking some aduantage vnder tence of making all sure, would haue put in extra∣inary troopes of Horse, and Companies of Foot  the Towne: but the Inhabitants answered, They and a Castle or Citadell already, mand to commaund : what neede then any more for  Spinla ot yet satisfied, vrged the necessity of manning their Ports in this suspicious time, and therefore onely de∣sired admittance of foure Companies to keepe their Courts of Guard about the Ports with the Burgers: bt tht was also denied, till at last vpon etter deli∣beration they admitted 4. Companies into the Town, but not to guard the Ports; who were no sooner pla∣ced, but Spinola conferres with the Commander of the Citadell, and so demaunds a lone of 120000. pound sterling in so gentle a manner, as they knew not what to say, but that they were not able to disburse it. FINIS.
