THE Emperors New Declaration AGAINST The Most Christian King: OR, THE Further Avocatoria and Inhibitoria against the Crown of FRANCE. Published by the Diet at Ratisbon. WE Leopold, by the Grace of God chosen Ro∣man Emperour, always the enlarger of Em∣piros; King in Germany, of Hungary, Bo∣hemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, and Sclavonia, &c. Arch-Duke of Austria; Duke of Burgundy, Stiria, Criinthia, Crain, and Wirtemberg; Count of Tyrol, &c. send Our Imperial Grace to all Our and the Holy Empire's Electors. Princes, and States. Vassals, Inhabitants, Citi∣zens, and Subjects, and to all and every Superiour and Inferiour Officers and Common Souldiers of Horse and Foot. All and every of the same, may easily call to mind, how that We, by the Crown of France's Invasion of the Holy Empire in the last Year 1688. contrary to all Trea∣ties of Peace, and without any just Appearance and Cause, and through the Barbarous Hostilities attending that Inva∣sion, were induc'd not only to send out Our Imperial Mandata Avocatoria and Inhibitoria through the Empire, but also by the Unanimous Consent and Advice of the joynt Electors, Princes, and States, out of an Absolute Necessity to publish a General War of the Roman Empire with that expresly, powerful, and binding Command, that no State, Vassal, Inhabitant or Subject of the Holy Ro∣man Empire, should engage himself in the Service or Pay of the Crown of France, or its Adherents and Abettors, or their Abettors, or keep any Correspondence or Com∣merce with the same, much less suffer its Ministers and Emissaries, or afford any Assistance or Retreat to any such like Persons, but to be Industrious to do them all sort of Injury; all which is more at large express'd in the afore∣said Avocatoria, and the thereupon ensuing Declaration of War, to which We anew graciously refer Our selves. Now considering that daily Experience teaches Us, that the Crown of France does not only at present continue its Hostile Enterprizes, but also fills the Holy Roman Em∣pire, Our beloved Country of the German Nation, with such barbarous and dismal Tyranny, and inhumane Cru∣elties, as were never heard of in any Heathen or Turkish Wars, and which ought to be pass'd oven in silence in a Christian. History; So that it seems that the French endeavour as much as in them lies, not so much to reduce the Ger∣man Nation under their Yak, as utterly to destroy and root it out; of which a clear and unanswerable mark is, that contrary to all Faith, and Word, and Promises past, they have made that horrible Desolation and Destruction of the Ancient Cities of Spiers, Worms, Manbey, Offen∣brg, and several others; wherein some have behaved themselves with that Rage and Fury, that besides the burn∣ing and pulling down of Houses, they also opened the very Graves and Tombs, and not so much as excused the Bones of the Roman Emperours and Kings, who had there rested for some hundreds of Years; nay, have not so much as lest one stone upon another of the Ancient Re∣ligious Houses. Wherefore We have, so much the more carefully to prevent that neither directly, nor indirectly any help be given to such wicked and Ʋnchristian Under∣takings, after mature Deliberation held, and with the Consent and Advice of the joynt Electors and States, thought it necessary to augment and exrend Our above∣mentioned Mandata Avocatoria and Inbibitoria, which We here renew in their whole Contents, in the follow∣ing manner. And first, We herewithal do afresh earnest∣ly Command, Will, and Require, by the Roman, Impe∣rial, and Absolute Power Invested in Us, that not only the Inhabitants, Subjects, and all such as belong to Us and the Roman Empire, that are in Civil and Military Ser∣vices of the French King, or his Allies, and privately and openly are Abettors, or assisting to their Abettors in any Part whatever, that they immediately after the Publication of these Our Imperial Avocatoria, upon the Penalties and Punishments expressed in Our former Avocatoria, repair into the Holy Roman Empire, Our Hereditary Kingdom and Territories, but also that they from this time forward, and as long as the present War shall last, shall not suffer themselves to be employed for any other, whoever it may be, than their Country, and its presentand future Allies, who actually are in the present War against the declared Enemy of the Empire, upon pain of incurring the same Punishments; much less suffer them to List them, but wholly to forsake all Foreign Services. On the other side, they who shall willingly Obey these Our Mandata Avoca∣toria; and repair in due time to Us or their Princes, Lords, and Superiours, shall be accommodated and assisted ac∣cording to Justice and their Quality. In the second place, We Command, by vertue of the same Imperial Power, with the Unanimous Consent of the afore-said Electors and States, that no French Ambassadours, En∣voys, Ministers, their Retinue and Emissaries, nor any of the same nor other Nation, not only may not be suffered by any Electoral, Princely, or other Courts and Cities in the Empire; but also that no French-man, nor French∣woman, Spiritual or Secular, of high and low Degree, be for the future admitted into Religious Benefices, Cloysters, and Colledges, or into Service, and such as are in already, to be dismissed, upon pain of incurring Punishment, saving that so far as concerns the Spiritualty, their Heads, Superiours, and Ordinaries, will undertake and answer for them, that they shall not attempt any thing injurious or disadvanta∣gious to Our Interest, and that of the Empire, by Cor∣respondence, or in other kinds: excepting nevertheless such Secular French, as have resided many years in the Empire, or withdrew thither through Motives of Conscience and Religion, and have been received into the Protection of some of the States of the Empire, and have hitherto in all Places industriously paid the usual Duty and Submission to their Lords and Superiours, and have further lived according to the present and other Or∣donnances of Us and the Empire. In like manner, in the third place, no Germans, whoever they may be, or under whatever Name, Denomination, or Pretext it is, shall have leave, or be at liberty to Travel in France. And We likewise, in the fourth place, shall immediately account for Enemies of the Empire all and every such Foreign Power, as shall, to the Advantage of France, under what∣ever colour or occasion it may be, Attack any State or Al∣lie of the Empire, at present, or in the future, during this War; and as they are to be immediately reputed Ene∣mies of the Empire, so shall no German serve the same, but much more be bound immediately to forsake such Ser∣vice.
and repair to and be employed for his Country against the Common Enemy of the Empire. We Will & Command, in the fifth place, That all Trade and Traffick, Exchange, Correspondence, in whatever manner it may be, as well by Water as by Land, shall be wholly and universally bro∣ken off with the Enemies of the Empire without the least Connivance; and not only the States of the Empire, ac∣cording to the Oath whereby they are bound to Us and the Empire, shall stedfastly and strenuously adhere here∣unto, but also Our and their Subjects are in like manner by their Duty bound thereunto; and then further, Ours, the Empire's, and each Places respective Fiscals are to proceed summarily, and in high Fines, & bodily Punishments against the transgressors and neglecters of the same. And if any Commodities, Ships, Waggons, Horses, and other Car∣riages shall be caught in the Fact, all the same, as also the Money-fine, shall be forfeited, one half to the Informer, and the other to the Prosecuting Fiscal. We likewise for∣bid, in the sixth place, the Importation of all Manufa∣ctures of France, and such-like Toys; as also French Wine, Brandy, Oyl, and other Products and things, whether that they are brought immediately from thence, or through other Lands into the Empire in all Places, and particularly in the Maritime and Trading Towns, upon incurring the severest Penalties, and with Confiscation; nay, and after Discovery, severe bodily Punishment; and require that to this end, in all Passages on the Borders, as also in the Toll and Cu∣stom Places, where Merchants and their Goods are wont to pass, they proceed with astrict and thorough search, without Respect of Persons, or further by other means establish such convenient Order, that this Prohi∣bition may thoroughly, and without Exception, be ob∣served for the future, especially in the Principal Maritime, and trading Towns, that so for the avoiding of all De∣ceit, no such Commodities may pass, otherwise than upon the Credible Attestation of the Magistracy of the Place where the same were made, or whither they were carry∣ing, from the second, third, or fourth hand, upon pro∣ducing and knowing the first Atteslation. Wherefore We also seriously and earnestly Command all and every Gene∣ralities of War, Colonels, and other Commanding Offi∣cers, who are in Our Service, and that of the Holy Em∣pire, or its Electors, Princes, or States, that they as little as other Superiours, shall go about to grant any Protectoria, or Letters of Leave to any Domestick and Foreign Tra∣ders, who shall sollicite and insinnate into them for the liberty of Tradicking with French Commodities for a short time, or only for some days: Nor shall the same be granted by any Ambassadours, or other Foreign Ministers, residing by Permission in the Empire; but in case they be already granted, they shall ipso facto be esteemed void, and of no use, and no notice is to be taken of them. But so far forth as concerns French Commodities that were in the Empire before the Publication of the first Imperial Inhibi∣toria, the same shall be used in the following manner: That, whereas in some Circles in those matters due Preparations have not been already made, which if so, then to be dispos'd of for the Publick Use, each Merchant or Shop-keeper shall be bound after the day of the Publication of these Additional Imperial Inhibitoria, in eight, or at the farthest in fourteen days, to give in and deliver to his Magistracy, a Cata∣logue and Register, upon Oath, of all such French Com∣modities and Manufactures he has by him, upon pain other∣wise of Confiscation of the same, and then to expect what Term, which without weighty cause, shall not easily be pro∣longed shall be granted him for his selling of the same in the Land or City where he inhabits; which he is obediently to perform: And what he shall still have lest after the expi∣ration of the Term, he shall in a short time export out of the Empire, also Sub poea Confiscationis, or free himself of the same b consignation, or making them over to the Magistracy till time to come. Wherefore We Command all the Superiour Land Regencies to take in hand, and go about the  Observance, by Money-Fines, or bodily Punishments, against their Transgressing Subjects, Citizens, and Persons enjoying Protection; and so proceed to make such further praise-worthy and sufficient Preparations, that this wholsome Design may tend to the Profit of Our Coun∣try and immediate Damage of the declared  of the Empire; and also that the like Decrees be ¦nuously and stedfastly executed. But pa Admonish and Command in the seventh Place,  every the Superiour Land Regencies, to  most Diligence, that no Corn, Horses, Po Brimstone, Salt-Peter, and all other counter¦modities be carried and transported out of the  where-ever it be, nay, not so much as into F Neutral Countries, without leave granted upon ∣tant Considerations. We also admonish in the  Place, as well all Spiritual as Temporal Re earnestly to Command their Subjects, Citizens, ∣tection-men, that they, particularly the Merch and Trading People, do not forward suspected  and Packets addressed to them, but deliver the  their Regency and Magistracy, and they to take care  them, according to their Place and Duty; as also  Ours, and the Empire's Post-Masters, Post-Officers  others, Commissioned to carry Letters, are hereby  Commanded that they each with his own Name  stamp the Letters and Pacquets they receive; and if  harbour any Suspicion, immediately, and without any  and no less to the performance of their aforesaid Duty  up such Letters & Packets to the Regency of the Pl in case also, in the Ninth Place, any of the States or ∣bers of the Empire, not being under the Enemy's  shall not perform his bounden Duty, according to  and other Imperial Conclusions, or is already in a ∣lity, or in particular Treaties with France, or shall  hereafter; he or they so offending, shall be pro against with all Severity, by depriving them of all  and Benefices holding of the Empire, according to  Tenour of Executions, and other Imperial Ordon and also the Common Laws. As also no less, in the  Place, against all others, who act contrary to this Ord∣nance, either through manifest wilfulness, or the p of Publick Good, shall be stript of all their ∣tances and Lands, Prerogatives, Rights, Substance, Go and Wealth, Offices and Dignities; and also if they  ∣ken, be punishined Body and Life, and the absent Offi in their Effigies, and they and their Posterity make  capable of bearing any Title, and their Arms  defaced, as also uncapable of Church-Preferments,  Gentility, and Knight-hood, nay, and liable: any Punishment directed by the Regency proclaimed through the whole Empire, and the same shall be ∣ted upon due notice given in all the respective Parts  likewise finally Command all Superiour and Inferiour,  well Ecclesiastical as Temporal Regencies, Ancients, ∣veditors, and other Over-seers, to make known all ∣said to whom it may concern, and enjoyn them to ∣dience. And since it is very difficult, nay, wholly ∣possible to make such General and Particular Ordo as may provide for all Occasions that may happen,  before could not be fore-seen, all and every Some Regency, in their Respective Countries, are free and ∣powred, according to the juncture of Times, Persons,  other Circumstances, to enlarge these Avocatoria in∣hibiteria, and so to apply them to such un-sore-seen ∣casions, as shall promote the Publick Welfare, and th true intention to do Damage to the Enemy of the ∣pire; but not to take them away wholly, or in part,  so to compleat and fulfill them as far as lies in each  Power, and as shall shew his Fidelity and Love to his  Country; and lastly, avoid the above-mentioned P and Punishments. According to which, each one is to ∣gulate himself, and that we earnestly enjoyn. Given i Our and the Holy Imperial City of Augsburgh, the  of October, Anno 1689.
