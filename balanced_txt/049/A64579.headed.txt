THE PARABLE OF THE BLACK-BIRDS. And the MAGPIES Vindicated. ALL Sublunary Things are subject to Muta∣tion. A late Vulturean, to confirm which Maxim, is become a Black-bird; who listening to Interest, having chang'd his Note, whistles to the Second Part of the same Tune, ractis'd by the Black-birds in Forty One, (viz.) Down with the Magpies. But I find He, like the Owle, rather than Starve  the Wood, will submit to Catch Mice in the Barn; nd had rather live privately under the disguise of a lack-bird, then expose himself to the Publick danger  being thought (in these times) a Vulturean. SInce Nature seems Retrograde, the World's Metamorphos'd, Honesty turn'd Policy, each entence a Paradox, and each Satyr a Parable; hings looking all with Visionary Aspects, as if las, in a Rage, had cast the Globe from his wea∣ Shoulders, and turn'd the World Top-side∣rvy: I cannot but wonder; and yet Conform, ch others, to amuse the Age with a New Dream, gested after an old Method. And since Parables e become Accustomary, and Fables Fashionable, ntertain you with One, as followeth: 'Twas on a Time, when the Eagle, Soveraign  the Birds, began to inspect into the Grievances his Feather'd Subjects, from whom he had re∣v'd many Complaints, especially from the ck-birds; who pretended great Impositions re laid upon them by the Magpies, whose Ju∣e, Fidelity, and Allegiance, the Eagle had par∣larly observ'd; and plainly discover'd the Black-birds to be full of Hypocrisie, Malice, Co∣vetousness, pretended Zeal, Ignorance, and Am∣bition. The Eagle, with all Care, Equity, and Good Conscience, began Impartially to Examine into the Cause of this Irreconcilable Difference be∣tween Them, that he might Redress those Inju∣ries the Black-birds had sustain'd by the Magpies; and that they might become Friends, and Roust peaceably each upon his own Branch, one by another. The Black-birds, by this time, had whistled out all the Infamy against the Innocent Magpies, that the Malice of such Hedgbirds could contrive; whose desembling Notes mov'd the Owles, Cuckoes, Herns, Buzzards, Crows, Ravens, and Jackdaws, to be inclinable to pity their Complaints. Upon this, the Eagle, with his Doves, Pheasants, Nightingales, Golfinches, and Linnets, through a strickt inquiry, fathom'd their Designs, and clear∣ly discover'd the Cause of their Discontent, and Envy against the Magpies; who retaining no man∣ner of ill-will against their bitter Enemies the Black-birds, sought by all means to reconcile their Enmity, and establish an amicable Friendship be∣tween them; procuring them all such Grants of Privileges, as was requisite for the Ambitious Black-birds to be Masters of. But these Rebellious Birds, whom no Favour could win, no Reason Convince, or any Submis∣sion Pacifie, were still soaring to be Masters of the Magpies Branches craving all Preferments of the
Eagle, and whistling aloud, with strain'd Throats, Down, down, with the Magpies; pluck out the White Feather's from their Wings; they are Marks of the Vulture's Cruelty; Down with them; Quick, quick, quick! This Notorious whistle of the Black-birds, being heard through all the Adjacent Woods, Groves, and Hedges, greatly alarm'd the Hawks, Kites, Batts, Screech-Owles, and Night-Ravens; who, un∣acquainted with the Whining Deceit, the conceal'd Malice, and self-ended Subtilty of the Black-birds, ask'd them the Reason, Why they alarm'd the Woods with so dreadful a Whistle? Who an∣swer'd in great Flocks, which darken'd the very Trees they sat on, The Magpies are bringing Vul∣tury upon us, with Consent of the Eagle; Down with them, down with them! Which confus'd, Answer so amaz'd the Inquisitive Flock, that they all fell on screaming in discord, to shew the dreadful ap∣prehensions they lay under; promising the Black-birds, they would Perch by them, and use their Bills, and their Claws, for their Preservation to the utmost. Some of the Eagle's Loyal Doves, murmuring at the Treasonable Whistles, the Notorious Villanies, and Rebellious Proceedings, of the Black-birds, flew with all speed to the Eagle's Court, to inform him of their Treachery and Conspiracy against him, and his Government; which the Eagle hear∣ing, issued out Proclamation sign'd with his broad Claw, to impower the Feather'd Quire to make choice of Two Members for every such Grove, Wood, Bower, and Wilderness, where they had severally taken up their respective Habitations; that should present, and lay open, their Grievan∣ces before Him, and they should be redrest. The Black-birds whistling over the Eagle's Pro∣clamation, immediately took Wing, distributing themselves over all Woods, Groves, &c. under the Eagle's Dominion; advising all other Birds to make choice of such Members, as would pluck down the Magpies; for that they design'd to bring in Vultury upon them; which if they took not special care to prevent, they should not Roost safely in their Arbours, without the danger of destruction. This Rebellious Stratagem of the Black-birds, whistled such amazement into the Ears of the Cre∣dulous Choristers, that they pickt out none but, what were fit Instruments to carry on the Trea∣sonable Designs of the Black-birds. The day appointed by the Eagle's Summon the Members whistled out by the Black-bird consisting of Geese, Woodcocks, Canary-birds, an Waterwagtails, assembled themselves together, an Perch'd upon an Ancient Oak in a Neighbourin Grove, in the Eagle's Palace; where the Eagle, at∣tended by his Loyal Doves and Magpies, met the in his Royal Splendour; where he made to them a most Gracious Speech, expressing Himself wit all the earnest Affection becoming the Royalty  a Soveraign Bird, to his Winged Subjects; declar∣ing how Industrious his Magpies and Himself were to preserve their Laws and Liberties from the op∣pression of the Vulture; and that he would con∣descend to any thing they should propose, tha might establish their safety upon a more sure foun∣dation; and that it was plainly evident, the Blac-birds discontent proceeded from no other cause than Jealousie and Ambition; and therefore desi the Assembly of Birds there present, as he hop they were dutiful and faithful Subjects to Him,  Concur in all things requir'd for the Good  Safety of his present Government, under whi he desir'd, that they might enjoy all Pea Plenty, and Satisfaction. But the Black-birds, having whistl'd out daPrinciples into the Ears of the Feather'd Assembl that the Eagle's Gracious Speeeh availed nothi with them, so that they all flew out into gre Murmurings and Disorders, crying out, Do with the Magpies, away with Vultury. Upon this the Eagle thinking himself not safe his old Nest, took Flight, with his Doves and Ma∣pies, to a Wood forty Miles distant from his fo¦mer Residence. In this Interim, the Rebellious Black-birds whistling forth an Oration throughout the Eagl Dominions, That He, and his Magpies, design a Total Ruine of all the Birds of the Air, by int∣ducing Vultury amongst them; exciting them  Rebellion against their Lawful Soveraign the Eag and his Magpies. This Wild Note of the Black-bir so tickl'd  Ears of the Credulous Flock of Poultry, that th whetted their Beaks, and sharpned their Claw and siding with the Black birds, Levy'd War agai
veral Skirmishes, and Pitcht Battles they had, many English Cocks falling on the Eagle's fide; and many Owles, rds, and Cuckoos droping on the other; till, t last, by a as war, many Rebellious fowls standing up in vindication  Blackbirds, they grew too strong for the Eaglci's Party; at last, they took Prisoner, with several of his Loyal Doves, Magpies, Erecting a Court of Judicature by their own Ille∣mate Authority, placing Hawks, Herns, and Buzzards on the ; and Impanell'd a Jury of Black birds, Owles, and Wood∣; by which they try'd the Eagle; who made a Royal and ous defence; but, notwithstanding, he was brought in  by the Woodcocks, and had his head Chop'd off by a One∣ Hedg-Bird, upon a block erected by his own Nest, for  Purpose. This villianie of the Blackbirds being Effected, was Mourn∣ sung by the Nightingales and Goldfinches, throughout all the ves in Christendom, which reduc'd the Trait'rous Blackbirds er such an Odium for their Infamy, that their name grew eful to all birds in all Nations. t here was not the Period of their Villanies: For the ing Eaglet, (who by lawful Inheritance should have succeed∣ in the Soveraignty, which the Villanous lackbirds, by their -thirsty means, had snatch'd into their own Possessions) was  to Escape into Foreign Thickets, left the same fate of his ecessour should have been barbarously impos'd upon hiim. Now, the blackbirds, in the Eaglet's absence, began to flock a feather, and Consult the safest way to Continue the Govern∣ent in their hands, and exclude the Young Eaglet; in order to ich, they Chose an Old subtle Hawk, to Rule over them as tector, who immediately Run his Nose where the Old Eagle  set his Breech, and thankfully embrac'd the honour the ack-birds had confer'd upon him. The Loyal Magpies and Daws, who had escaped the Fury of  Old Hawk, and his Accomplices, were in Banishment with  Eaglet, during the time of the Hawk's Protectorship; which nued for some space of Time; till at last he sickened in lting Season, and dyed of the Pip; who was afterwards g up, to Scare the Blackbirds out of Paddington-Fields. he Blackbirds, at the Death of their Protector, began to bout in great Confusion, knowing not well who to place uthority over them; at last after a general Debate, it was ght fit to Confer the Honour of the Protectorship upon the ng Hawk, (still bearing an Exorbitant hatred against the es Posterity) but finding themselves uneasie under the Government of the Young Hawk, thinking him not rightly d to their designs and purposes, they Re-assumed the Au∣ith of the Throne into their own hands: Hpon which, y discontents sprung up amongst the Eagletonians; who e mighty desirous, that the Young Eaglet might be restored his ightful Soveraignity: and a Loyal Dove, that wanting no∣g but oppertunity to effect this purpose; who having some sands of good Old hardy true bred English Cocks under his amand, was resolv'd (if occasion required it) to try one ng Blow with the Blackbirds, to restore the Eaglet to his one; who having assurance of the Fidelity of the Doves, pies. Cocks, and most Birds of the better Rank and Quality, ntur'd to quit his Forreign solitariness, and Assume the glo∣s Soveraignty of the Birds, which lawfully Descended to Order to effect this Enterprize, he Consulted with his friendly Doves and Magpies, for the Management of this weighty Affair; who encouraged and advised him, by all means, to lay hold of the Present Opportunity to do himself that Justice, which the Blackbirds, if in Power, would never Condescend to do him. This so Animated the Royal Virtues of the Eaglet, (who want∣ed neither Greatness, Goodness, or Activity to perform a Noble Action) that He Immediately concurr'd with Them, and took his flight from his wandring desert, attended with a Train of Loyal Doves and Magpies, who had conveniently shar'd the fate of their most belov'd Eaglet; He had no sooner Pearcht upon the Bough, in the Precincts of his own Soveraignity, but the Nightingals Linnets, and Goldfinches strain'd their harmonious Throats, to warble him a hearty welcome from his wandring Exile. This News was soon spread by the Eagletonians through all the Neighbouring Groves and Bowers; which being Chirped in∣to the Ears of the Blackbird, soon made them quit the Doves and Magpies lofty Cedars, and shroud themselves under their Old Cover, Shrubs, and Hedges, to hide themselves from the Justice of the Eaglet, which their Villanies had long deserved. The Loyal Birds plucking of their Rusty Feathers, which the discontent of a long War had continued on them, they Spruc'd up their Chimes, and, with unanimous Joy, met the Eaglet, and so Conduct him with all Splendour and Safety, to the Throne of his Royal Ancestours; which was effectually performed with all Splendour and Solemnity imaginable. The Eagle then thought fit to send forth his Gracious De∣claration, to assure his Feathered Subjects, of his Goodness and Mercy towards them, even to the Rebellious Blackbirds; which gave them such Heart, that they began to have the Confidence to peep their Mischievous Noddles out of the Bushes, which had deserved to have been set up for Scare Crows, had not the Eagles goodness been greater than the Blackbirds Merit. The Eagle, by this time, being firmly seated in the Throne of his Ancestours, giving his Subject all the Prospect of a Con∣tinued happiness under his Government, and the Blackbirds giving all assurance of iheir Fidelity and Aliegance to the Eagle, by humble addressees, fill'd with all Protestations of their Loyal∣ty; which the Eagle, for some time, believ'd, till he dis∣cover'd some sparks of Reason to the Contrary. The Government had not rested long in this Peacable State, when the Blackbirds, seeing the Eagle continue the Lover of his Ancestors to the Magpies, reassum'd their worsted Infidelity, and began to conspire the Death of the Eagle: To accomplish which, they (at a time when the Eagle visited a Neighbouring Royal Grove, as his Annual Custom) ambuscad∣ed themselves in a Ryfield, when the Eagle, with his atten∣dance was to fly by: But He through the Quickness of his Eye, and sharpness of his Judgment, discover'd their desigin trapping some in a Gin for their Insolence. The Blackbirds seeing their Plot disbover'd, and Infamy for ea o'er the Eagle's Dominions, began to exasperate their Malice so against him, that they use all possible means to disparage his Royal Virtues, by taxing him with the same Crimes, with which they had wrongfully accused his Predecesor; which made the Eagle stretch forth his Talents, for his own secu∣rity: Thus they continued plotting and contriving many Years  bring the Eagle, and the Magpies, to whistle to the Blackbirds
une; but their Designs were all frustrated by the Eagle and Magpies policy. At last, the Eagle tir'd with his tedious Reign, and very much disturb'd with the Insolence of the Blackbirds, soar'd up into the Lap of Jove, and left his Soveraignty to the Ostrich; whom the Blackbirds, as well as the rest of the Feather'd Choire, admitted very peaceably to the Throne; all things carrying a fair prospect of his own Glory, and his Subjects Happiness. But, at last, the Blackbirds fixing their Eyes upon the splendid plumes of the Illegitimate Peacock, began to withdraw that Loyalty and Affection, which till that time, they had paid with seeming great Devotion to the Ostrich. The Peacock, seeing himself so ador'd by the Blackbirds, began to display his Gawdy Wings and Tayl before the Sun, amidst the Admiring Crew of Flattering Spectators; who Addrest him with all Submission add Applause; entreating him to take upon him the Patronage of a Flock of Fowls, which so much Admir'd and Ador'd him. The Peacock, Proud of the Favours he had obtained of them, Return'd them thanks for the great Honour they were willing to Confer upon him: the restless Blackbird, now having the Gaudy Wings of the Peacock to shelter their ill Designs, by prevailing Whistles, they perswaded the silly Bird to believe, he is Right Heir to the Soveraignty of the Birds, or that the Ostrich was an Usurper, a Tyrant; and that he joyn'd with the Vulturans, to destroy the Rights and Priviledges of the Blackbirds, and the rest of the Feathered Subjects, by supporting and maintaining Vultures in each Grove and For∣rest, contrary to the Laws and Statutes Established in former Ages by the Eagles; and therefore, ought not to continue in the Possession of the Throne, which by Right was the Peacocks: This pleased the unthinking Peacock, who asked the Blackbirds, if they would stand by him, and he would Invade the Domini∣of the Ostrich, and Reduce their Laws and Liberties, by Force of Arms, to the same State, as they were when the Hawk Govern'd? They all Answered, Down with the Ostrich! Ʋp with the Peacock! Down with the Ostrich! Ʋp with the Peacock. Upon this, the Blackbirds fitted themselves for a Rebellion against the Ostrich, with all expedition Imaginable, and assur'd the Peacock of their fidelity and Readiness to serve him, with their Bills, and Plums, in the support of this Rebellious Expe¦dition; desiring the Peacock to Proclaim open war against the Ostrich, and declare his Title to the Kingdom of the Birds; and that they would Immediately come in, and stand by him, in defence of his Right, and their own Liberties, to the last blood in their bodies. The Peacock, deluded with the deceitful Notes, whistled to him by the Blackbirds, immediately proclaims War against the Ostrich; and Pearches, with his Birds of Battle, on the Western side of his Dominion; which News was soon brought o the Ears of the Ostrich, who sent out an Army o Sprightly Birds; who making a Vigorous Onset upon the Blackbirds, and heir Peacock, soon defeated their small force, and put them ll to flight: The Peacock, for his safety, flew into a Pease∣eld, where he was discover'd, and took Prisoner, and sud∣denly after, by the order of the Ostrich, had his Head twisted ff for High-Treason: And many of the Blackbirds Followers ad the misfortune to be choakt with Hempseed. The Success of this Victory, added much to the Magnani of the Ostrich; to Whom all Partys, with great submition, ∣gan to acknowledge their Allegiance, and especially Blackbirds. The Ostrich thinking himself now so safely seated in his Th that no Birds were able to contend with him, or Power rem him, begins to consult all Stratagems, with the Vulturean B to Introduce Vultury amongst them; which design being ∣derstood by the Doves and Magpies, they Consulted all means imaginable, for the Prevention of Vultury comin upon them, and the rest of the Birds: Whereupon the Ostrich, as a means to effect his Design-Hand, Publishes a Declaration for LIBERTY for Blackbir, Woodcocks, Owls, Vulturians, &c. thinking, by that means  give opportunity for Vultury, to grow perswasively upon  Doves and Magpies, till by this means he growing strong eno to contend with them and the rest of the Feathered Choi but these Stratagems were no ways effectual: For the M∣pies apprehending the Designs of the Ostrich▪ Chattered it  all the Birds in the Air, and that not only they, but the Bla∣birds, &c. might beware against such proceedings. And  Magpies being more Inquisitive in this Affair, then the Ostr thought necessary, were seven on them committed into a Cag which made excellent sport for the Blackbirds, who Whistl all the Merry Tunes in their Budget, to see the Magpies un such Confinement. The Ostrich now began to Rule very Tyrannically o're  Subjects, entertaining and advancing the Vulturians and Bla∣birds chief Preferment about his Court, and likewise place th in Authority, over all Woods and Groves, &c. throughout  whole Dominion: And to carry on his Design the better,  advised his Mate to steel an Egg out of a Cuckcoes-Nest,  hatches it her self, to Cheat, the Doves and Magpies; who  knowing she had not Lay'd-in many Years before, was v much discontented such a trick should be put upon them Whereupon a Foreign Spread Eagle, being inform'd of th Illegal proceedings of the Ostrich, and his Mate (and at  Request of several of the Feather'd Choire) came over, w many Martial Birds of the Ayr: And Invaded the Ostric Territories: Upon which the Ostrich being taught with Reflec∣ons of his past Follies, and unkindness to his Loving Subject had not the heart to contend with the Spread Eagle, who p∣peared in their Vindication; but immediately taking Wi flew over to the Vulture, craving shelter under his Win leaving his Subjects to be Guarded and Redrest by the Spre Eagle; Whose care is daily to repleat that Happiness amon them, which the Ostrich, in his Reign destroy'd, if not obst∣cted by the Restless Murmurs of the Blackbirds.
