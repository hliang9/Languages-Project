DIRECTIONS TO KNOW where any Towne you desire to find out lies in the Mapp immediately. IF you desire to finde out in the Mapp, the Towne of Knockfergus I looke in the Alphabet, and I finde the Towne, and finding the Towne, I see in the Booke, it lies in longitude 16. degrees, and 24. minutes in latitude, 54. degrees, and 36. minutes: bring with one of your fingers a strait line from the degree and minutes of the longi∣tude, and with another of your fingers, a strait line from the degree and minutes of the latitude till these two lines meete in a square, and there you shall see the Towne of Knockfergus: this is a rule for all other
Townes that you desire to know where they lie in the Mapp. Directions to finde the distance from one Towne to the other in the Mappe. IF you would know how farre Dublin is from Knockfergus, take a pair of Compas∣ses, and put them to the Scale of Miles at the foot of the Mapp, extend them as long as the Scale is, which is 40 miles: every black, and every white being a mile: Then measure from the Towne of Knockfergus to the City of Dublin, and so many times as it is the length of the Scale, so many times 40 miles it is from one Towne to the other: Or if you would see any other Towne that is not so much as 40 miles distant from Dublin, then take the measure from Dublin to the Towne you would know, and then set your Compasses to the Scale of miles, and you shall see how many miles it is by the Compasse, counting every blacke a mile, and every white a mile, and that is the distance: by this you may know the
distance of any one Towne to another. If you would know by the Book what Province any Towne you looke for is in: the name of the Province is set downe by the Towne in the Book. How to know the longitude, and the latitude, and the degrees, and the minutes. ON the top of the Mapp of Ireland, you shall finde written longitude, and on the side of the Mapp of Ireland, you shall finde written latitude, the degrees are mar∣ked with figures, the minutes are the black and the white: that you see every blacke is 4. minutes, and so is a white; at every twentieth minute there is a small stroke: there is three of them small strokes between every degree, which is 60 minutes, which makes a degree, every black and white be∣ing 4. minutes.
IRELAND. IRELAND is situate under the tenth and twelfth climates: The longest day being 16. houres and more: It standeth to the west of Britaine, being of length from South to North neere foure hundred miles, and in bredth two hundred miles: the most usuall name amongst wri∣ters is Jernia, he moderne Hibernia, the English Ireland, the Inhabitants Eryn-land, which in their language signifieth Westerne land: It is environed on all sides with the sea, having on the South part the Virginian sea; on the west, the main westerne Ocean; on the North, the Deucalidonian sea; and on the East, the Irish sea, which divideth England and Scotland from Ireland.
This Island or the soil, it is full of moun∣taines, hills, woods, bogs and lakes, but abundantly fruitfull, as may be seen where the industry of man playeth the Midwife with the Earth, in helping her to bring forth. It nourisheth no venomous beasts, so that a man may sleepe securely under a hedge, and in the open field upon the ground: All the breed thereof except wo∣men and gray-hounds, are lesser then in England. The native people are generally strong, and nimble of body, carelesse of their lives, patient of cold and hunger, implacable, in enmity, savage, cruell, trecherous and su∣perstitious, easily adicted, and extreamly laborious, especially those commonly cal∣led the Kernes or wilde Irish; but such as are bred with the English and Scots are more civilized. Since the first plantation there, of our English, the people have been governed by a Vice Roy, who wee usually call the Lord Deputy, to whom there commeth no Vice
Roy in Europe more neer the M jestie and Prerogative of a King. Ireland is divided into foure Provinces, 1. Munster. 2. Connaght. 3. Vlster. 4. Lemster. and these into 32. Counties. The Metropolis of Ireland is Dublin, seated on the hiffe in Lemster, wherein is an Vniversirie: This City after the English conquest was people by a Colony of our Bristoll men.

THE BLOODY ATTEMPTS Vpon the Kingdom of IRELAND in general, and on DUBLIN in parti∣cular; and how it first began. UPon the three and twentieth day of October 1641. the Castle of Dublin should have beene surprised, (as at that time it might easily have been) for there was no fear or suspition of Treachery, there being at that time 400. Irish Papists elected out of most parts of Ireland, desperate persons, designed and appointed for that bloudy and desperate attempt, all lodging and sculking in several places of the City and Suburbs, waiting and expecting the time and watch-word, when to give the onset. One of their own Country-men at that time, ab∣horring so foul and detestable a Treason, revealed it to Sir William Parsons Knight and Baronet, Ma∣ster of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Sir Iohn Borlase Knight, Master of the Ordnance, both Lords Justices of the Kingdom of Ireland. The party who discovered the plot, had been formerly a servant to Sir Iohn Clotworthy, but at the time when he revealed their designe, he served one Capt. Mack-Mahowne an Irishman, who lodged at
the signe of the artichoak, vulgarly called S. Ma∣ries Abbey in the suburbs of the City of Dublin, The servants name was Owen Mack-Connel, who being with his master Capt. Mack-Mahown, in a house in Cookstreet, at the lodging of the Lord Mack-Gueere, also an Irishman in the City of Dub∣lin. Vpon the two and twentieth of Octob. being the night before: his master did then and there reveal the whole plot unto him in the presence of the Lord Mack-Gueere, and others. This Owen Mack-Connel had married an English woman, by whom he had children living in the County of Antrim, in the Province of Vlster, and she was and is a Protestant; assoon as Owen Mack Connel had heard and understood the plot, and their damnable intentions, with a sad countenance asked his Master what should become of his wife and poor children, he replyed in these words: hang her English Kite, we will get thee a better Wife: But the Company perceiving that his thoughts were troubled at the relation of this horrid Tra∣gedy, now to be acted on the stage of Ireland, that within few houres was to be in a flame of confusi∣on, the word to be given, that, man, woman, and child should have been butchered the next morn∣ing: the poor mans heart failed him at this hellish and barbarous massacre, whereupon these bloody Villains, perceiving by the alteration of his coun∣tenance that he approved not, or rather, like a man
amazed, startled at such a bloody motion, as to im∣brue his hands of his owne dearest wife and chil∣dren, and that that is more, of his owne Country and Kingdom, they began to bethink themselves what to do with him; they resolved to make him drunk, and thereupon enforced him unnaturally, to drink so much that he could hardly drink more, yet they plyed him close, he desired to be excused, they to give him his load powred it downe his throat, he resisting such unreasonable violence, there steps towards him one Donal Mack-Gueere, saying, will you not drink your liquor, see if you dare deny to pledge me? thereupon set a pistol to his brest with two bullets, the pan being primed with powder and brimstone, that so it might not fail to speed, twice it was offered against him, and took no fire, whereupon Capt. Mack-Mahown stept in and said, let him alone, God will not suffer him to be killed, he will be on our side I warrant ye. They after∣wards led him from the lord Mack-Gueers lodging to Capt. Mack-Mahowns lodging, but the poor man, faining himself more drunk then he was, and taking the advantage of the time and place, wil∣lingly fell down in a dirty channel, and was so bemired with mud, that none would help him up, but with much adoe he crept out of the kennel, and reeled to the stoop of a door, and sate downe to sleep, he seeming to sleep, the fellow which was left with him to watch with him, departed,
which this Owen Mack-Connel perceiving, assoon as ever his back was turned, with a bold resolution arose up, and went to the Marchants key in Dub∣lin, between eleven and twelve of the clock at night to Sir William Parsons house, one of the Lord Justices of Ireland, where knocking at the doore, the Porter knowing him, demanded of him what he would have, he answered he must needs speak with his Lord, the Porter replyed his Lord was in bed, It is no matter answered Owen Mack-Connel, I must and will speak with him, for my businesse concerns both King and Kingdom; then the Por∣ter let him in, wondring to see him in such a pic∣kle, still he hastened the porter, until he had called up one of his Lords Gentlemen, who got up spee∣dily, and went into his Lords bed-chamber, where he acquainted his Lord with the earnest desire this Owen Mack-Connel had to speak with him concer∣ning a businesse of weighty consequence, but would not reveal it to any but his Honour, where∣upon he was called up & had accesse to my Lord, unto whom he discovered the whole plot, which was to be executed the same morning at 9. of the clock, this being between twelve and one. At the first the Lord Parsons did seem to slight it, but Owen Mack-Connel confidently affirmed the thing to be true, and withal told him thus, my lord I have discharged my duty and my conscience, look you to it; I will go back to my master, because neither he, nor the rest shall suspect me.

Your Lordship shall find my lord Mack-Gueere at M. Cadowgans house, and Capt. Mack-Mahowne at the Artichoak, whither I now goe. This Owen Mack-Connel going to his masters lodging, takes dirt in his hands, and besmuts his face, that they might think he had tumbled over and over in the dirt: whose approach into the room (where many were assembled together, drinking; for they in∣tended not to go to bed) was so ridiculous, that the company burst out into such a laughter, the place rung of them round about: and to welcome him home, the company fell to their old course, to make him drink more, but he told them that he must needs go into the yard, so they suffered him but commanded two of his companions to attend him, and bring him up again, but they let him go into the yard by himself: no sooner was he in the yard, but he leaped over the pale, and so escaped.
A true Description of sundry sad and lamen∣table Collections, taken from the monthes of very credible Persons, and out of Letters sent from Ireland to this Citie of London, of the perfidious outrages and barbarous cru∣elties which the Irish Papists have com∣mitted upon the persons of the Protestants, both men, women, and children in that Kingdom, since Anno Dom. 1641. THe Irish nation is a people both proud and envious. The Commonaltie ignorant and illiterate, poor, and lazie: and will rather beg or starve, then work; and therefore fit subject for the Priests and Iesuits to spur on upon such bloudy actions and murtherous designes. It is too well known that the Irish have mur∣thered of the Protestant party in the provinces of Vlster, Leinster, Connaght, and Munster, of men women, and children, the number of fifty thou∣sand, as it is credibly reported by Englishmen, who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do protest upon their oaths, that there are above five thousand families destroyed. The Irish have most murtherously and trayte∣rously surprised them upon great advantages, and
without respect of persons, either of age, youth, or infancie, of young men or maids, or of old men or babes, stript all to their skins, naked as ever they were born into the World, so they have gone out of the World, many starved to death for want of food and rayment; the Irish have shewed them no more compassion, nor so much as they do to their dogs. At Belturbait in the County of Cavan, the Po∣pish Rebels demanded the Town, on promise that if they would surrender, they should passe free with bag and baggage: On serious considerations of the inhabitants and the Governour, they were perswaded to yeeld it up, which when they had done; they sent about twenty or thirty to guard them; when they had guarded them seven miles from the Town, they seised on them, robbed all the Protestants, being between five hundred and a thousand persons, men, women, and children: who submitting themselves to their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they stript them all naked, and turned them into the open fields in bitter cold weather, not affording them one of their lowzy rags to hide those parts which even nature com∣mands to be covered. In London-Derry, belonging to the Londoners, Sir Philem Oneal promised under hand and seal to let the poor Protestants passe with bag and bag∣gage, onely to part with their Town: yet this

persidious Rebel stript man, woman, and childe, took their clothes for a prey, and sent them out naked, without a shirt or smock to their backs: this was one of their works of mercy. But the ten∣der mercies of the wicked are cruel. The Lord Macquires brother at the beginning of the rebellion, for the first fortnight commands his souldiers to give quarter to women and chil∣dren, but to massacre all the men. The Handlowans came to Tom-regis, divers of them assaulted the Castle, of which Captain Saint Iohn was Commander, he with his son got away with some difficulty, leaping over the wall, they fearing they might fetch some supplies, took the Captains wife, and set her on the wall, having stript her to her smock, who was big with child, and within an hour of her deliverie, that in case the Captain and his son should have assaulted the Towne, his wife should have been the white at which he must have levelled. M. Trafford a minister, was assaulted by these bloudy wolves, who desired but to call upon God, yet they would admit no time, but fell on him, and hackt him to peeces. Sir Patrick Dunstons wife ravished before him: they slue his servants, spurned his children till they died, bound him with rouls of match to a board, that his eyes burst out, cut off his eares and nos, teared off both his cheeks, after cut off his armes

Luttrell was basely betrayed by an Irish boy that he had bred up in his house: who when he was at dinner, was surprised by threescore o those Irish unmercifull villains, with a company of whores and bastards that followed them which this boy let in at a back door, where pul∣ling him and his wife from the Table, and fou small children, and one sucking at her breast: stript them naked, and then thrusting them in a violent manner out of dores, threatned to kill them if they went not speedily away. So they departed, being ashamed to be seen of their ser∣vants, towards Dublin, hoping to find some o their friends in the way to relieve them, but the farther they came, the more miserable they were, meeting their loving friends robbed (by others) in the same manner, which struck in them such a∣mazement and fear, that their hearts failed them, so that being naked and hungry, helplesse and hopelesse, the poor Infants crying in their eares, they sate down under a hedge and died: The same day some Horsemen riding that way to coast the Countrey, met this youth, unto whom hee told this sad story, and led them to this lamenta∣ble sight, where they beheld the true love of man and wife, embracing each other in their death: the three eldest children dead, but the sucking

childe was alive preserved through heat, bein between them both, and grabling and gaping fo the dead mothers breast. So the Troopers took up the childe, carrying it to a nurse, and bestow∣ed some clothes upon the English youth. In the County of Roscommon, there fled in∣to the parish Church eleven score of the English, men, women, and children, where they remain∣ed three daies and nights without any sustenance, till they were almost starved: so that at last they were forced to commit themselves to the cruelty of the Irish, who stript them naked, after drove them through the Towne like so many harmlesse Lambs over a Bridge at the Townes end, having before broke downe one of the middle arches, where a strong water runneth, so that either they must leap in, or come back, their intent being there to murther them, as they did: For the poor wretches being sick, weak and faint for food and sleep, some returned back, whom they killed with∣out mercy, others they thrust into the water, who were drowned: some that could, did swimme towards the shore, and there, inhumane villains, they ran and met them before they could get to land, and knockt them on the head in the wa∣ter. Master Blundry a Minister they hanged, af∣ter pulled his flesh from his bones in his wifes sight.

In the County of Tyrone was the cruellest mur∣ther of all the rest, committed by some Souldi∣ers upon the bodies of one M. Charles Davenant, his wife, and two young children. The villain which first entred the house was known to one of the servants in the house, to be commonly cal∣led Thady O Swyllivane, somtime a servant to this M. Davenant, and lived not far from Dungannon, in the County of Tyrone. The servant that knew him could speak good Irish, and so escaped, being an eye-witnesse of these passages ensuing. This Swillyrane and his rout broke in forcibly into the house, where they found M. Davenant with his wife and children, they immediately seised upon him and his wife, and bound them both fast in their chaires, making a great fire, after they stripped the two children, slue them in the sight of their parents, and after rosted them upon spits before their faces, they were compelled (poore souls) to behold that cruelty which they could not help: after they stript his wife, forcing her most uncivilly and unmercifully before his face: and afterward cut her throat: the distressed Gentleman being over pressed with the lamenta∣ble sight of the death of his wife and children, stri∣ved and strugled in his chair where he was bound, hoping they would have kild him, chusing rather to die any death, then to live any longer. So when  had made an end of his wife and children,
the Lord Blany forced to ride 14 Miles without Bridle or Sadell to saue his life, his Lady Lodged in Strawe beeing allowed 2• a day to releue her & her Children, slew a kindsman of hers and hanged him up before her face 2 dayes telling her she must expect the same, to terrifie her the meere. intaglio print of a hanged man and a woman with two children Mr Dauenant and his Wife bound in their Chaires Striped the 2 Eldest Child¦ren of 7 years old rosted them upon Spittes before their Parents faces Cutt heir throte and after murdred him. intaglio print of a man and woman tied to chairs and two children being roasted on a spit
in this barbarous manner, they untyed him and stript him, and afterwards murthered him. At the Borough of Kello, the Rebells surpri∣zed the house of one Arthur Robinson, hee him∣selfe being at that time in Dublin, he not knowing that the Rebels were risen in those parts there, in∣tending to have gone home to his wife and family, before his appointed time to return home, a Mes∣senger prevented him with heavy tidings, even his only Daughter, whom hee quickly knew, though she were much disguized, for the Rebels had slaine most of his family, robbed and pillaged the house, after they had stripped his wife and ra∣vished her, they sought out for this young Vir∣gin, who had hid her self in a barne, where the Villanes found her; but she made what resistance shee could, and with a knife shee had (unseene to them) wounded one of them, which the rest per∣ceiving, seized upon her violently, stripped her, & then bound her with her arms abroad, in such manner as she could not help her selfe any way, and so destoured her one after another, puld the hair from her head, and cut out her tongue, be∣cause shee should not report the truth and their cruelty, but the maid could write though she could not speak, and so discovered their inhumane usage to her and her mother. The maid was sent with a letter from her father in Dublin, to her uncle at Mynhead in Somersetshire.

In the County of Fermannagh, Mr Champion was betrayed by an Irish Villaine (his Tenant) whom he had saved twice before from the gallows: the rogues name was Patrick Mack-Dermot, who find∣ing one of his Companions, brings him to Master Champion's house, and tells Mr Champion that hee found this thief stealing of his cattle: the Gentle∣man knowing this Mack-Dermot, said unto him before one Mr Iremonger, I am glad thou art turn'd from a thief to catch a thief; whereupon hee re∣turned him this answer, that Hee was no more thief than himselfe. No sooner had he utter'd these words in the Court, before his house, but there rushes in upon them a great number of rebells, who stabd Mr Champion before he could get into his house: but their fury went further, for they wounded him with their Skeins in thirty places after he was dead, and then cut off his head while the rest ran into the house after Mr Iremonger, they fell upon him, and ran him thorow: Then the Rebells entered the house, and killed more, his wife's sister and her brother in law; his wife was down on her knees to beg a sheet, to put her hus∣bands dead body in. And other friends that came to visit him, lost their lives. In the County of Monaghan, one Master George Foorde, a great company having gotten into a loft over a stable, when he with his wife and Familie were gone to Church, hid themselves till they

came home, watching their opportunity, first se upon him without any words, and then entered the house, bound all the servants, till they had found Mistris Foord, whom they stript naked, and bound, taking from her her keys, having also her husbands keys, and opened every Trunk and Box in the house to finde their money, where they sound but little to that they looked for; wherefore they began with threats to kill her, if she did not tell them, but alas she could not, then they fell a torturing her, heating a pair of Tonges in the fire, and clapping them to the soles of her feet, and palmes of her hands, so that with the pain thereof she d. After she was dead, they ript her body to see if shee had not swallowed any gold into her guts; and so when they had pillaged the house, and carryed away with the Horses and Carts, all that was worth the carriage, they unbound the Irish servants, (which they before had bound) and murthered such of the English as they pleased, and then departed. They have set up Gallows five miles distant in diverse places, on purpose to hang up the Prote∣stant Spies: they ave likewise set women and men on red hot Gridirons to make them confesse the mony and goods they had, or whether they have hid or sold any. They have cut off mens privy members, and stopt their mouths with them, that they might

commit such horrid villanies without noyse. These bloudy Papists forced the Protestants to pull off their clothes, and then killed them, on purpose, that they might have their clothes with∣out holes. They have forced (as is reported) some to turn to their cursed bloudy Religion, and then perswa∣ded them that they were fittest to die, and then treacherously kill their bodies, and doe what in them lies to kill their soules. Others they have wounded to death, and then left them languishing, their bellies being ript up and guts issuing out. An Irish Rebell (as a credible friend reports) snatcht an innocent babe out of the arms of the mother, and cast it into the fire before her face, but God met with this bloudy wretch: for before he went from that place, he brake his neck. Another, Rory Macqueere, who came into an English Gentlemans house, and found him in his bed, and there began to cruciate and torture his naked body to make him confesse where his trea∣sure lay, which when this poore distracted Gen∣tleman acknowledged, they cruelly killed him, and then stript his wife naked, and turned her out of doors, took his daughter and satisfied his beast∣ly lust on her, deflouring her, cut off her garments by the middle, and then turned her to the mercy of the common Souldiers, to bee abused at their pleasure.

The Protestant Troopers marched out of Dublin, to view the Coasts, they espied a Rebell hewing a woman in so horrid a manner that it was not possible to know her, having acted his Devillish part, he triumph'd over the dead corps, and washed his hands in her bloud, whereupon the Troopers apprehended this barbarous villain in the very act of crueltie, and brought him to Dublin with his hands all bloudy, and was ad∣judged to be hanged immediately, hee ascended the Ladder, and would not stay till the Executi∣oner turned him off, but desparately leapt off and hanged himself. These Villains take children and tosse them with pitchforks like dung into Rivers: one was an eye witnesse who saw a cruell wretch, throw a woman crying with teares one way, and he Childe with a pitchfork another way. They have cruelly murdered women great with child, and then left them in ditches, to the fu∣ry of their dogs, who have eaten the children out of the bowels of the mother. They inslave poore protestants under them, making them work like horses all day, digging and delving for them, and then are shut up all night, not knowing what wages, whether life or

A Minister seeing his wife abused, and his chil∣dren roasted, desired them to put him out of his extremity of anguish, to see such crueltie on those so neer him, they most inhumanely cut his tongue out of his head. Seventeen of those barbarous monsters came to a Ministers house, where they violently fell on him and his wife, stript them naked, bound them back to back, then cut off his privy members, af∣terwards ravished his wife on his back, and then inhumanely cut their throats. Women were delivered whiles they were hang∣ing. One ripped up, and two children taken away and all cast unto, and eaten by swine. Another stabbed in the breast, her childe sucking. They forced 40. or 50. Protestants to renounce their profession, and then cut all their throats. Christians have been eaten by Dogs, and Dogs tearing children out of the womb; the bloudy be∣holders relate such things with boasting. Two were said to be buried alive, and others that had been long buryed digged up; they saying that the Church could not be consecrated whiles Hereticks bones lay therein. And in the Church of Newtown was a childe boyled alive in a Caldron. Divers women and children murdered, lying

The rebells met with a Protestant Minister at Kells, by name Mr Sharpe, who had three children, two of them on his back, and did most barba∣rously hack, cut in peeces, and murther him, thrust∣ing into his body three o four pikes together, and then threw him into a ditch of water, where they left him. Captain Bryan mac Mahon, of Tehollan, said, hee would hang any that could speak English: And a Priest said that all the English must be hanged, and being asked why, hee said, meat was scarce, and they would not be at the charge to keepe them. FINIS.
