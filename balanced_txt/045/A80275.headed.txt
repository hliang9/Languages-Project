A Compendious NARRATION OF THE Most Examplar LIFE OF THE Right Honourable and Most Vir∣tuous Lady Mary, Late Coun∣tess of Shrewsbury. Faithfully Collected out of the Wri∣tings of a most Learned and Worthy Person who attended her many Years: By a Gentleman, who by reason of his long acquaintance and much conversation with her can testifie the truth of all that is here related. Printed in the Year, 1677.
Her Birth and younger years. IT was in the year of our Lord 1599. on the 4th of October, that this our Island, and particularly the City of Westminster, was honoured by the birth of this Lady truly Noble by all Titles. It was in the house of her great Uncle by the half-bloud Sr. Tho∣mas Parry Chancellor of the Dutchy, that she first began her course of mor∣tality, which she so holily past over; and it fell out to be in a room which had been formerly a Chappel dedica∣ted to God in honour of the most bles∣sed Virgin Mary his Mother, and on the Feast of the glorious Patriark St. Francis; a proper time and place for the birth of a person so much addicted to passe her time in the house of God, and so true an Imitatresse of the ver∣tues of that great Queen of Heaven,
and that humble Saint. And as this happy creature (whose life I am now exposing to publick view) was far from giving trouble to others throughout the whole course of her life, so also did she give none to my Lady her mother in her very birth, who though she had suffered hard la∣bours of all the rest of her children, and of some of them dangerous; yet in bringing her into the world, seem∣ed as it were exempt by particular dis∣pensation from that common curse layd by God upon the whole sex: Her descent was very Noble on all sides; her father was Sir Francis Fortescu of Salden Knight of the Honourable Or∣der of the Bath, a Gentleman of a very ancient knightly Family, he being an heir of Sr. John Fortescu of the Privy Council to Queen Elizabeth and King James, and descended lineally through a race of noble Auncestors (many of whom had served their Princes in e∣minent charges both Military and Ci∣vil, and were allyed by their marria∣ges
to several of the Nobility;) in the 15th generation from Sr. Richard For∣tescu Knight, who came into England with the Norman conquest. Her Mo∣ther the Lady Grace Fortescu, as emi∣nent for her virtue as her birth, was of the most illustrious Family of the Mannors, Earls of Rutland and Lord Roos, she being grandchild to Thomas Niece unto Henry, and Aunt to John, all Earls of that place. To this advantage of bloud God had added that of so amiable, and sweet a disposition, and of so solid and live∣ly wit and judgment, that she was grateful to all persons, and very capa∣ble of any knowledge, which her sex is wont to possess: this she made ap∣pear, in her perfect and easy learning even of those ornamental qualities, which took up the least of her thoughts, and in which (according to the fashion of other Ladies of conditi∣on in those times) she was in her younger years brought up; Though after her being married (out of her
great modesty, and almost continual application of her self to employments of a higher strain) she never, but in just and unavoidable occasions spent a∣ny time in things of that nature. But it is not my business here to play the Herald, and to blazon her extraction, or to dwell upon those in∣feriour transitory advantages of flesh and bloud; my aym is to paint out the ornaments of her minde, and to shew how near she was allied by her vertues to those Princes of heaven, the constant attendants on the Throne of God. Of those great virtues, which were so e∣minently practised by her in her riper age, she gave many auspicious prog∣nosticks even from her infancy, her love thereof and inclination to all acti∣ons of piety growing up in her with her years, and even preventing them. No child could be more exactly duti∣ful to her parents, in compliance with whom she applyed her self with that zealous diligence and success to the gaining of a perfect knowledge and
understanding of all the mysteries and articles of her faith and duties of a Christian, as also of the grounds of all the Ceremonies used in the Holy Church, that she was capable in her very childhood of declaring and ex∣plaining them to others, and even then gave so great a testimony of so unusu∣al a maturity of judgement both in her comportment, and all her actions, that she was thought fit, and actually had leave of judicious and learned Ghostly Fathers to receive the most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, before she was yet arrived to ten years of age. And finally, she grew to that degree of Christian perfection even before she could write young woman, that she had an ardent desire to give over the world, as soon in a manner as she was entred into it, and dedicate her self to God by imbracing a religious life for love of him. But her parents nei∣ther giving way rashly to those desires of hers, nor daring expresly to oppose them, in regard of their great piety,
caused the case to be consulted with Learned Religious men! And upon the casting up of all circumstances, wherein her delicacy of constitution, and continyency in point of health had a great part, they advised her to satisfy her self with leading a virtuous life in the way of a secular calling: where∣upon she knowing that obedience (in some cases) is better then sacrifice, and weighing this truth in her wise heart, that no body (since he is a party) is fit to be a Judge in his own ways, applied her self to walk as perfectly as she could in that state, to which her pa∣rents, both spiritual and temporal, ad∣vised her: And in consequence to these counsels and advise, she was be∣stowed by her friends in Marriage at the age of 16. upon that Noble Person John Tallbot then Esquire, and after∣wards Earl of Shrewsbury, Nephew and Heyr to that most Saintlike and Learn∣ed Lord, George Earl of Shrewsbury, who resolving to live wholly to God even in the world (as to all mens admirati∣on
he did) disposed his Nephew in Marriage to this Lady, and setled his whole Estate upon them and theirs. And in that condition she lived most happily and holily (as will hereafter appear) above nineteen years. The manner how she daily and constant∣ly spent her whole time after she was married. WHen once this Lady was setled in the state of Marriage, she did so order and frame the course of her life; that living here upon earth, her conversation might be truly said to be in heaven: Of this not only all her days, but even hours and mo∣ments were convincing testimonies. As soon as she rose in the morning, which was Winter and Summer at an early hour, before she thought of her dresse (the first and chief business of worldly Ladies) or spent any the least time in that or any employment or dis∣course whatsoever, whereunto the
duty of her calling did not precisely o∣blige her, she prostrated her self on her knees, and in that devout posture passed a full half hower with profound silence of the tongue, but with vehe∣ment affection of the heart, in offering to God that gratefull Incense of de∣vout prayer, accompanied with acts of an ardent love of his divine Majesty, of a most sensible gratitude for all be∣nefits, and an entire resignation of her self, and all her concerns unto his di∣sposal, and likewise with a most hear∣ty and zealous oblation of all her acti∣ons, thoughts, and words to his ho∣nour and Glory; and for the Petiti∣oning part of her devotion, it aimed not at temporal blessings, but only at the obtaining of his grace to avoid sin; and rather then to incur the guilt of any that was mortal, she most con∣stantly and earnestly supplicated him to be deprived of all worldly advanta∣ges, and pleasures whatsoever, and e∣ven of what is most dear to all man∣kinde, life it self; which with all sin∣cerity
of heart she professed her self much readier to loose, then his grace and favour, whereof sin was only ca∣pable to dispossess her. After this time of recollection, and a short space spent in her dress, where∣in she never studied in the least degree either pomp or vanity, but kept her self within the compass of a modest decency, she repaired to her Oratory, only used for divine service, and there passed the far greatest part of the re∣maining time till dinner (which was usually about Noon) in prayer and such other exercises of piety as suited with that place. The Afternoon was no less piously spent then the morn∣ing, for rarely did she employ her self less then six hours during those two seasons in those holy actions in that place just before-mentioned, which was dedicated to Gods service. Her going abroad to take the ayre, (which sometimes she used to do, out of her accustomed hours of devotion, which were regular and
constant, in order to her own and chil∣drens health) never interrupted these her pious imployments; for even all that time, as far as a civil compliance with others (which she never viola∣ted) would allow of, was totally spent in them. Neither was her time of working, wherein she employ'd her self most, (except in her devotions) any distraction to her continued exer∣cises of piety, since that imployment was usually ever accompanied with the reading of some spiritual book in order to her dayly advancement in virtue. But neither prayer nor any other employment occasioned her omission of that great duty which lay upon her in looking after the government of the Family which my Lord by reason of her great prudence committed wholly to her care. For she frequently visited all the Offices of the house, both to see good orders kept, and to enquire what was wanting in any kinde: In her timely supplying whereof, as she was
most Conscientiously wary in avoid∣ing all wastful expences, so was she truly generous and noble, in not suf∣fering the meanest of the servants to want any thing, that was usually al∣lowed to any one who served in a most plentiful house; And I am sure I may say by experience and knowledge, that this charge of hers was managed with so singular a conduct, that during her life, my Lords constant hospitality and plentiful way of house-keeping, as al∣so the number and quality of his at∣tendants, corresponded to the full to the greatness of his quality; And all this within the compasse of his Estate and Fortune, and according to the rules of a most orderly Christianlike discipline. And of this generous hos∣pitality the poor were constantly in great numbers (I may say multitudes) most ample partakers. Her time after supper before her go∣ing to rest was as religiously spent as the rest of the day; For she always was emploied about an hour after her re∣tirement
to her chamber (which was ever at an orderly hour) in the exami∣nation of her conscience, and such de∣votions, and other acts of piety as she had used at her first up-rising, and so closed the day in the same religious manner as she had begun it; And this time of recollection passed so sweetly with her, that she would hardly be brought to believe that it lasted above a quarter of an hour, but when it was performed, she made it her business, by avoyding all unnecessary distra∣cting discourses, to keep her heart fix∣ed all night upon him, with whom she had been then so devoutly parlying. And she was so indefatigably con∣stant in these her daily devotions, that when she was hindred, (either by journeys, visiting, or receiving the visits of Friends, or any other just occa∣sion,) from performing them at her ac∣customed orderly seasons, she would rather deny her self time to take that corporal sustenance, and rob those hours from her rest, which her ten∣der
constitution required, then ever willingly be guilty of any least omissi∣on of any part of them. Even her childbeds and times of greatest weak∣ness were never any bars or lets to her continual devout employments in such manner as her condition would per∣mit. She began the first pains of her labour, with a most humble and peni∣tent confession of her sins, and as soon as possible, after her delivery, she caused the Hymn of those eminent Saints and Doctors St. Ambrose and St. Augustine called te Deum to be said by her, she an∣swering alternatively every other verse; to the end that to Almighty God might be rendred most humble thanks for her safety, and that his mercy might be implored to take that childe into his particular care from whom she had received that blessing, esteemed one of the greatest of a Ma∣trimonial state. And that she might not be totally debarred from partaking personally of all the Churches devoti∣ons during her lying in, she caused
the Litany to be said every evening in her chamber, and spent much of the day in glorifying God, partly by vo∣cal, and partly by jaculatory prayers and aspirations, and all those holy exercises that were consistent with her strength and ability. And though she could not at that time till she were Churched be present at the divine ser∣vice (a devotion never omitted by her at other times) nor receive the most Blessed Sacrament, yet did she not fail daily, even during the time of her be∣ing confined to her bed, to spend that whole time when that service was ce∣lebrated (which she took care to have signified to her) in prayer, with the same preparation, devotion, and appli∣cation of her thoughts to those high Mysteries there commemorated, as if she had been actually present at it, and endeavouring to do it at least in a spiritual manner by disposing her self thereunto in the same way, as if she had been really to receive the effect of her longing, according to her con∣stant
custome at all times, when she went not to this holy Communion; whereunto she rarely or never omitted (the months of her childbed only ex∣cepted) to have recourse twice at least, if not thrice every week; And her soul did so truly rellish the delicious∣ness of this divine Banquet, that she would even have daily feasted her self therewith, had not her great humili∣ty induced her to comply with those guides of hers in spiritual matters, who judged it not fit for those of a secular calling, since even Religious Persons of that sex, and of the other, Priests only excepted, are very rarely allowed that priviledge. Neither did she ever approach this Sacrament without an extraordinary devotion, having first, according to St. Pauls advise, proved her self by a most strict examen of her conscience, and also a most penitent and humble confession, as the abun∣dance of tears, usually shed by her, when she frequented that Sacrament, might sufficiently testify, and which
often issued from her eyes in plenty when she discoursed of her own im∣perfections; and she did even like and ther David water her bed with tears when her (I may truly say) too ten∣der conscience accused her of an thing that seemed to her to carry th appearance of a sin, though it real∣ly were not such. And though all th chiefest part of her days were (as hat been sufficiently testifyed) spent i prayer and other pious and devout em∣ployments, yet were those of Com∣munion passed over altogether (in  manner) in such exercises; she usua∣ly then (as much as possible) totall retiring and withdrawing her se from all worldly business and conver∣sation. And her posture in her pray∣ers was for the most part so much up∣on her knees, that at her death, the were found as hard as any board, o (like to what was said of St. James th Apostle) to have more resemblanc with the skin of a Camel, then wit that of a Lady tenderly brought up, a
she was, and had a most pure skin and delicate constitution. Her lively Faith and great Charity. AMongst her other daily devotions she never omitted to offer particu∣lar thanks to God for that great and singular benefit of her having been bred up in the Catholick Faith, which she knew to be the foundation of ju∣stice and sanctity, and without which she knew it was impossible to please God, and that it was only to be obtain∣ed by his gift; And therefore her soul was always full of gratitude for that great blessing, and she was frequent in giving devout testimonies of it. And so zealous was she in the professi∣of this only true faith, that when she heard of any that suffered death, im∣prisonment, losse of temporals, or any other vexation for that cause, she fol∣lowing the counsel of St. Peter, would glorifie God in them, and with a pious affection and emulation lament
her own cause, for that she had nev yet been thought worthy to suffer an thing for confessing Christ befo men, who hath so graciously prom sed to confess such before his Father  heaven. Neither was this lively faith of he unaccompanied with a truly ferve Charity which as it is the Queen  all virtues, and so necessary th without it no other could be grate in the sight of God, and Faith it se were dead, so was it the study of th Noble Lady to excell therein. And though her great desire of d dicating her self to the service of A mighty God in the course of a relig ous life, and (that not being thoug fit for her by her parents and di ctours) her endeavors to turn a se∣lar life into a monastical, by her co∣tinual spending her time in exerci of piety, and so many hours daily prayer, as hath been already relate be most convincing and undenia testimonies of her most ardent love
his divine Majesty which is the prime nd chief branch of this greatest (if we may believe St. Paul) of the Theo∣ogical virtues; yet for a farther evi∣dence how streightly that pure soul of ers was linked to him with that gol∣den chain of charity, she never stain∣ed that white Stole of Innocence, which she received in Baptism by the committing of any one mortal sin, ei∣her in thought, word, or deed, hroughout the whole course of her ife; and by consequence never lost is grace and favour during all that ime; And though all those who were cquainted with her will finde no dif∣ficulty to believe this as a most real ruth, (so very faint-like were her ctions and conversation) yet is it so credibly attested by one who had the ost reason of any to know the in∣ward state of her soul, (as having had he guiding thereof for many years, nd having during that time been made more then once partaker of all he passages of her life wherein her
conscience was concerned) that it can∣not be brought in doubt by any rea∣sonable person whatsoever. And her aversion was so great from offending God, that though a most tender-heart∣ed mother, she would frequently of fer up her children to his divine Ma∣jesty, humbly and earnestly supplica∣ring him rather to take them out of the world, then ever to permit them to stain their souls with any morta sin; so much did she prefer his ho∣nour before the inclinations of flesh and bloud, and the fulfilling of hi holy Law above all the contents and comforts, which worldly people s much dote upon. Nor did her arden love of God appear only in her avoid∣ing of mortal sin, and her sollicitud that others should do the same, bu also in her vehement desire of ren∣dring her self eminent in the practis of all manner of virtues, meerly t please him; and the vehemency  these desires would transport her to  frequent lamenting of her own neg∣ligence
and tepidity, and expressing er sense thereof to to her spiritual irectour, whose assistance, and ad∣ise she would crave in order to a to∣al refraining from offending God, e∣en by any the least imperfection, and ow at length she might attain to hat height of virtue that might in∣ble her to be, and continue wholly is. For his sake and for love of him he honourd all the saints because they were his faithful servants, and in the rst place the Virgin Mary his most lessed Mother, because she before all thers was the most grateful to him. he did not honour them as Gods but s attendants upon his throne, and ho through the special assistance of is grace have attained the beatifical ision for all eternity; for if it be ot only lawful but laudable, nay e∣en of obligation, and therefore plea∣ing to God, to honour and reverence any here upon earth, who by their inful lives may have incurred his
high displeasure, much more grate∣ful must it be to him who is wonder∣ful in his Saints, to honour the whom he hath honoured, with ma king them co heirs with Christ, an who now are subject no more t the fraylties of humane nature, co tinually glorifying him in that hea∣venly Jerusalem whereinto nothing defiled with the least spot can eve enter. And when she read their live and actions, and saw therein how the had forsaken the world, and trample upon the delights thereof, and ded cated themselves totally to the servi of his divine Majesty, she would b as it were inflamed with a desire  imitating them, and expressing he love to God, in as high and perfe a manner as they did, and wou grow unsatisfyed with her self for n having followed the inclinations sh had in her tender age of entring in a religious state, till she was secure by those, that guided her conscienc that her obedience to her parents i
the choise of her course of life was more acceptable to God, (considering how maturely and piously they had weighed all circumstances) then a compliance with her own desires, though they seemed to sway her to that which carried an appearance of greater perfection. To the end there∣fore that she might serve him with as much perfection, and in the exactest manner that was consistent with her calling, and to prevent her love to him from proving cool in the least measure, she often and with great favour renewed her good purposes, of all her daily pious exercises and employments, and especially against great and solemn Feasts, when his greatest mercies and benefits were celebrated by the Church; and she would be then particularly sollicitous to crave the advise of her spiritual Directour, what acts of pennance or other devotions she should use, where∣by to solemnize those holy times, in the most agreeable manner to his di∣vine
Majesty, to the end she might gain encrease of his grace, whom she with all constant gratitude owned to be so large-hearted in bestowing his favours upon all such, as begged them devoutly, and prepared themselves worthily to receive them. In fine, so great was the love which this most pious Lady bore to her Lord and God, that it put her upon making purposes of fasts, and other austere and laborious acts of virtue, that far ex∣ceeded her strength and ability; and so little indulgent was she to her self, out of her desire to perform any thing, though never so hard, that she thought tended to his honour, on whom her love was only bent, that she was wil∣ling to look upon all those purposes as obligations in conscience, till she was assured by those who were her guides in spiritual matters, that they were not such; but that she was rather ty∣ed from doing any thing that might be prejudicial to her health, wherein the good of many were concerned!
And though the same love of God prompted her to obey her spiritual Directors for his sake, who for hers and all of us was obedient to the death of the crosse, yet had the memory of those sufferings of his, such an influ∣ence upon her heart, that she was de∣sirous to imitate him as much as she might, and carry her crosse after him according to his divine invitati∣on, as far as her weak strength would permit; and therefore would come as near to the observation of any peni∣tential purposes, as she was in any manner permitted; so that where fast∣ing was denied as to the matter of the quality of her meat, she endea∣voured to supply it by moderating the quantity thereof, and the ab∣staining from all kinde of delicacies in her diet; and the like she did in all other purposes that tended to mortification. But in all others not judged (by reason of inconsistency with health and ability) unfit, she was most zealously constant in the
performance of them, and particu∣larly in her recourse unto the holy Sa∣craments, at certain times, when any special favour of God to her self, or this Nation in particular, or the Ca∣tholick Church in general, invited her grateful heart to expresse a resentment of his mercies. Her Charity to her Neighbour. FRom her most ardent love of Al∣mighty God, and her constant de∣sire of expressing it, proceeded her so eminent practise of that most a∣greable virtue to him, (I mean) her so very exemplar Charity to her neighbours, which mounted to so great an height, that she was never satiated with imparting all both spiri∣tuall and temporal comforts, that were possibly to be offorded by. And to de∣scend to those particulars, which may convince this truth, she was never seen, or known to refuse an alms, when it was asked, neither was ever
the necessity of any person represented to her, to the removal of which she did not contribute with a most cheer∣ful and bountiful hand; And it was a matter of complaint, and grief to her, whensoever any of her domestical ser∣vants, as sometimes it hapned, con∣cealed the requests of any necessitous persons, although relieved by them∣selves; and she was so zealously fear∣ful of losing any occasion of feeding and cloathing Jesus Christ in his little ones, that to prevent it, she always lodged moneys in the hands of her Porter, and others, for relief of the poor, over and above that plentiful alms which was constantly given at the gates. And besides these acciden∣tal expressions of her great charity which were nevertheless very fre∣quent, and as it were daily, she had diverse persons, her constant Penti∣oners, whom she wholly maintained, and though sometimes by reason of her change of dwelling, they were far ab∣sent from her person, yet they were
never so from her thoughts, for she was as sollicitously careful to see them provided for in all kindes, as if she had been expresly obliged to do it under pain of sin, and she descended so far as with the labour of her own hands to make many necessaries for their cloathing, the which she also fre∣quently did for many of her poorer servants, over and above their compe∣rent usuall allowances: she was so ex∣act an observer of the laws of true Christian charity, that she was never willing to hear those who demanded an alms for Gods sake suspected for counterfeits, for she was as tender in preserving their good names, as she was in relieving their necessities, and therefore as much as possible hindred the strict examination of things o that nature. And although some times some were discovered and pro∣ved to be such, yet upon consideration that the true motive of Alms was not to whom, but for whose sake it was given; she would not dismiss them
without being made partakers of her charity: for she would urge, that most probably their great want was the true cause why they dissembled lameness, blindness, and such like infirmities, and that therefore to take away such a temptation their necessities were to be relieved. And my Lord her husband was very complying with her in this compassionate relieving of others ne∣cessities, and particularly when he was a winner at horse-races or other Divertisements, he most cheerfully, upon her suggestion and request (which she never failed to make him) employed no small part of his win∣nings upon these charitable offices. Neither was her charity only ex∣pressed in relieving the pecuniary wants of the poor, but also in an extra∣ordinary diligence to contribute to the cure and ease of the sick; To promote which pious work, she provided her self yearly, at fit seasons, of all those medicinal things, which are usually applied to the relief of corporal infir∣mities;
and she was no less carefu in providing, then liberal in bestow∣ing them, whensoever necessity re∣quired: and so great was her chari∣table compassion of sick persons, tha she not only afforded them bountiful remedies for their diseases, but eve charged those servants about her ow person not to fail of giving them a necessary attendance; and to encou∣rage them in so good an action by ex∣ample, she did frequently visit th meanest of her own domesticks, an others; even when the loathsomness of the disease, and rooms where the lodged, were capable to divert thos who were indulgent, in pleasing thei senses, from coming near them; a did both minister remedies and othe assistances with her own hands, an spend much time in praying by the bed-sides, and endeavouring to giv them all spiritual comforts that sh was capable of affording them. Neither was her compassionat sense of the sufferance of prisoners les
hen that which she shewed to have of the wants and infirmities of others, for she was highly charita∣le in the relief of all those (al∣though meer strangers) whom she eard to endure that great calamity of restraint of liberty. All her promises made even in her oung and tender age that tended to he relieving of others necessities, or night be conducing to their advan∣ages either spiritual, or corporal, hough not made with that delibe∣ation that might oblige her (under in) to performance, were as religi∣usly observed as vows, and even so xactly (if not scrupulously) that he was hardly ever satisfied to have sufficiently complied with those no∣way-obliging promises, without the udgment, and authority of her piritual Directour; and she would requently regret her own too dull mitation of that famous patriarch
of Alexandria, John sirnamed th Almes-giver for his great liberality in acts of charity. If then Alms be of so great force and virtue, as to cleanse and purif the soul, which no Christian ca doubt of that gives credit to hol Scripture, where it is said, Give Alme and all things be clean unto you, Luk 11.41. and as water quencheth fire so doth Almes extinguish sin; and  the mercifull shall finde mercy, Ma 5.7. and he that giveth but one dr of water for the love of God shall n lose his reward: Mar. 40.10.4 How pure must her soul be, who bowels were so full of compassion and whose hands were ever open  the poor; and what accumulated r∣wards shall she receive from t bounty of God, who was so mero∣ful, and bountiful to his poor,  cheerfully cloathing, feeding, and v∣siting them, or rather him in the
For it may be truly said fo this La∣dy, what Job declared of himself, that she denied not to the poor what they desired, nor made the widdows eyes expect, nor did she eat her bread a∣one, but made the poor partakers with her. This therefore being so great a ruth, and so known by all that knew her, there will remain no wonder, if when she was taken out of this world, and translated to a better, there to enjoy the reward of hose great virtues, which the mer∣cy of God had plentifully infused in∣o her happy soul. The poor people n all places where she had lived, but especially in Worcestershire, where y reason of her longer abode, she ad met with more occasions of xercising her Charity, did general∣y lament their losse with all possi∣le expressions of sorrow, as con∣eiving themselves by her death de∣rived of a most indulgent Mother; which part she truly acted to the
life amongst all, whose necessities obliged them to have recourse to her assistance. But her charity was not only ex∣ercised in relieving the corporal di∣stresses of others, but flew an higher pitch, and made it self appear in a most ardent zeal of assisting the spiri∣all wants and remedying the mala∣dies of the soul: Her ever constant, and (as it may be truly called) in∣flamed desire of reclaiming all per∣sons from sin, whom she knew it con∣cerned, and procuring them all those helps from others, which her sex rendred her incapable to afford them in her own person, were undeniable arguments how extraordinary he zeal was of gaining souls to God. Of this truth many of her acti∣ons of this kinde might be particu∣larized, were it not too unnecessari∣ly to swell this Relation with en∣deavouring
to make that appear, whereof all that knew her were suf∣ficiently convinced: Howsoever, it it will not be impertinent to touch briefly upon one of these her Acts of charity, in regard Almighty God did give such a signall evidence, how grateful it was in his divine eyes, by a most wonderful, if not mira∣culous preservation of her from a strange and dangerous accident which followed immediately after the per∣formance of this good work. For having been to visit a Noble Gentle∣man her near Kinsman, whom she knew to have fayled contrary to his judgment, by humane frailty, and to have led a life too conformable to such a failing, and having (which was the sole end of her visit) with earnest pious admonitions, and fer∣vent prayers powred forth to God by his bed-side (to which his infirm condition had confin'd him) proved successful in her endeavours, and
wrought so good an effect, that he became a most perfect penitent, by re∣conciling himself to God, and so made a most happy end; having (I say) done this most charitable work, in her Return to her own House, in a certain steep descent, near an high unfenced bridge of stone, her coach-horses grew so unruly, that one of them kick'd down the coach-man from off his box, and ran violently to the bridge, and running in their full carrier over it, the coach fell suddainly into the River; and so high was the bridge, that it turned twice round in the falling, and at length lighted directly upon the wheels in the River, and in such a part of it as was shallow, though ve∣ry near the deepest part, which was capable to have overwhelmed it, had it been many yards higher then it was. In the fall the foremost horses broke their tackling, and escaped the precipitation, but of the two
wheel-horses, both of which, fell with the coach, the one, (and he who did the main mischief by kick∣ing down the coachman) broke his neck and was killed, the other fell with the coach without the least hurt. All those who knew this place, and particularly those who attended her, and were eye-witnes∣ses of the accident, and saw how free from all harm their Lady and her Wayting-Gentlewoman (which was all the company she then had with her in the coach) remained after it, would not call this so total a preservation by any other Name, then that of a Miraculous delive∣rance; and certainly it can admit of no other interpretation, but of a malitious attempt of the Devil a∣gainst her, for having got a soul out of his power (of which he had been too long possessed) and a most particular tract of the divine Provi∣dence, in rendring his malice inef∣fectual.
For God was only in her thoughts when she was falling (as she confessed to one who had pow∣er to ask her) she being then actu∣ally employed in making acts of love to his divine Majesty to render thanks to whom for his so highly merciful a preservation from this so great disaster, was the first thing she did after her return home, before she spoke to any one whomsoever; she repairing immediatly to her Ora∣tory to this most Christian-like Ex∣ercise, and there reciting with great Devotion that pious Hymn (called Te Deum) composed by those great Saints and Doctors of the Church St. Ambrose, and St. Augustine, and used by all the faithful in solemn Thanksgivings to God for his bles∣sings and manifold mercies: these her high acts of charity so universally extended, render it needless to re∣late how incessant the care was that she took in the instruction of her
children in all the mysteries and duties of Christian Religion, which she would personally perform her self, as soon as they came to those years that rendred them capable thereof. Even as soon as they began to make any shew of speaking, she was sollicitous, that before any other word, they might learn to pro∣nounce the holy, and divine name of Jesus, to which all knees bow, whether in Heaven or Earth, or else∣where, and that their prayers might be the first discourses that they might use, that so they might begin in the first place to speak to God, to whom the first and chief honour is due; and in their Nurses arms, when they were at any time brought home, her first caress was, to signe them with the signe of the Cross, and immediately to carry them to her Oratory, to offer them to his divine Majesty and beg blessings for them. And as their age encreased,
she did not fail to encourage them, no less by word then example, to the exercise of all virtues, and par∣ticularly to a liberal, and compassi∣onate relief of the poor, which Christ doth so expresly own as done to himself. Neither was she wanting to act the part of a Mother in this kinde towards the meanest of her servants, to whose being catechised, and taught all Christian duties, she with constant zeal contributed even personally, when need required, and of whose exact performance of all those Obligations to which ei∣ther the laws of God or of his spouse the holy Catholick Church, tye her children; she was so pious∣ly sollicitous, that they wanted nei∣ther frequent admonitions to en∣courage them to good, nor such re∣prehensions as were requisite to alter them from all evil. And all things relating to the discharge of their domestical employments were by her
most Christian-like providence so ordered, as that they might not prove any hindrance to their atten∣ding to the service of God, or ren∣dring him all due honour, by being present at divine service, and all o∣ther holy exercises, at times appoin∣ted, by that authority which he hath left here on earth, assisted by his ho∣ly spirit, to guide and govern the spirituall kingdome of humane souls. Seeing therefore it hath been made appear so evidently, how high and even supererrogatory a charity she shewed both in relieving the corporal necessities, and also in contributing so efficatiously to the spiritual ad∣vantages of others, It cannot cer∣tainly enter easily into the sus∣pition of any rational person, but that she was equally careful not to do any one the least imaginable In∣jury; I am sure it would be inju∣rious to her for any person to har∣bour
such a doubt in his breast. For how sensibly tender her conscience was in all that concerned the re∣putation of others, there are as ma∣ny witnesses as persons, that knew her, who all with one mouth, avow that she was never heard to speak any the least word, that might tend to the diminution of the credit of any one whatsoever, nor ever to use any deriding expression or re∣proach even in the reprehension of the meanest of her servants; But on the contrary side, her tongue was ever ready (how wary soever she was in avoyding much discourse) to defend the reputation, and excuse the faults of others against those ma∣ny who are too apt both to misre∣present, and misconster the actions of their neighbours, and too uncha∣ritably to rip up the memory of their failings; And all her reprehensions even for the greatest faults were ac∣cording to Christs counsel, private∣ly
given, for the concealment of their imperfections, and were season∣ed with so much sweetness, that her anger was not only innocent but virtuous; And in composing all dif∣ferences (which sometimes happen in such numerous Families as hers) between her servants, she was a ve∣ry Angel of peace, and was exactly careful, that even those of the best quality that attended her, might do right to the very meanest without all partiality. Her Other Virtues. WHen good principles are laid, the consequences are general∣ly ever clear: so that it seems a kinde of demonstration, that so live∣ly a faith, and so exemplar a Cha∣rity as her soul was adorned with, must necessarily be accompanied with all other virtues; so fervent a lover of God could not but take
delight in the practise of all that which is agreeable in his sight. How∣soever I will endeavour briefly to shew how eminent she was in all kindes: And to begin with that rarely to be found perfection in the feminine sex of this latter age (mo∣desty); she excelled therein in so high a degree, that her conversati∣on and comportment, might seem commendable ever in a veiled vota∣ry, much more in one of a secular calling; nothing ever appeared in her habit or dress, that might not merit a praise from the most scru∣pulous observer of the rules of that virtue: And so careful was she that none under her charge might offend therein, that she permitted not her children to reade any books, without an assurance from her spi∣ritual guides, that there was nothing in them contradictory to faith, or destructive to modesty, much lesse did she allow them either to haunt
any company, or use any divertise∣ment that might in the least degree endanger the violation of that so much praised virtue by all pious per∣sons, and particularly commended by St. Peter the holy Apostle in these words, that the chaste conver∣sation of Christian Ladies was to be in fear, and their trimming not to be outward, as consisting in the curling of their hayr, 1 Pet. 3.4. adorning themselves with cu∣rious and costly clothes, but in the inwardness of heart, which is hid∣den, and the incorruptibility of a quick and modest spirit, which indeed is highly rich in the sight of God. Neither was her humility lesse ce∣lebrated by all that knew then her Modesty; For she not only made ap∣pear this high virtue, truly high be∣cause so eminently practised by the highest of all Creatures, the Mother of God, in avoiding as much as pos∣sibly
her condition would permit, all things either of oftentation or pomp, whether it were in apparel, or any other real vanity, and in treating all persons of what rank soever with all imaginable sweetness and affabili∣ty, though without any indiscreet diminution of that dignity in which God had placed her, and which no Lady knew better how to comply with then her self, but in that quintessence of this divine virtue, humbleness of heart, which still mo∣ved her to undervalue her self, and to expresse to her ghostly Directour, so much affliction of minde, for her want of worth to merit those many blessings God had bestowed on her, both spiritual and temporal, upon account (as she would frequently urge even with abundance of tears) of her many sins and imperfections, insomuch that he was forced for her comfort to use many perswasive dis∣courses and reasons, (which her life
and practise rendred abundantly convincing) that she looked upon her few imperfections with magnify∣ing glasses (for no great sins ever stained her pure soul) and not through Opticks, which made a true discovery of them. But as this true humility of hers would not permit her to take any notice of her own virtues, but kept her heart still fixed on the conside∣ration of her own unworthiness: (And so great did her own (small) faults appear in her own sight, that the very reflection on any the least imperfection filled her eyes with tears, and her heart with sor∣row) so on the other side, no bo∣dy was an higher magnifyer and esteemer of the virtues of others; and principally when they shined in persons of High degree, and would often bewail her self for not imitating such patterns, and parti∣cularly
she honoured, and frequent∣ly celebrated in her Discourse that remarkable example of great Ladies for piety, who truly trampled upon the pride and vanity of this world, the Countesse of Arundel (of the Lord D'Acres Family by birth;) be∣twixt whom, and her self there had passed many Testimonies of mutual kindness. And also that most ex∣cellent Lord, the immediate Prede∣cessor and Uncle of her Husband; George Earle of Shrewsbury, of whose great perfections she was many years an eye-witness: upon whose death she forthwith repaired to her ghostly Father, not with a heart filled with joy, according to the u∣sual strain of worldly Ladies, for the honour that was thereby des∣cended to her, but full of a deep sense of her own unworthiness to succeed so Saintlike a person in so eminent a degree, and therefore ear∣nestly begged the assistance of his
prayers, that she might not soyle that honour by her sins, but in some small measure (at least) imitate so good a president. Neither was she less eminent in that high virtue preferable before sacrifice (Obedience,) in imitation of our Blessed Saviour and divine Ma∣ster, who for us was made obedi∣ent to the death of the crosse, and who (though above all laws) was for our sakes content to subject him∣self to humane Ordinations. And she did not only practise this virtue in so high a manner (as hath been already related) in never having been guilty of any mortal breach of his holy Commandments, but also by a most exact submission to all the Pastors and Prelates of his holy Catholick Church, to whom he hath committed the cure of souls, and those particularly, to whom by virtue of that authority she had com∣mitted
the regulation of her own conscience, and spiritual concerns, with whom she frequently consul∣ted about those matters, and never failed in a strict observance of their advises and directions. And as to the duty of her own calling, and most punctual compli∣ance with the obedience due from a wife to a husband, I may affirm, without being contradicted by any one that knew her (and her own constant family exceeded 60. per∣sons) that the fault would lye at the mens door if all marriages were not happy, if all wifes did but imitate her example: For as she was most prudent in offering in an humble manner such advises up∣on just occasion, as she judged con∣ducing to my Lord her husbands advantage, so did she ever with all cheerfulness submit to his determi∣nation. And if he were at any time
indisposed in health, she not only expressed the tenderness of a most af∣fectionate wife, in her sense of his infirmity, and her sollicitous provi∣ding of all remedies for his recove∣ry, but ever performed all the du∣ties of a servant in his attendance; All which he hath with much gra∣titude frequently acknowledged, af∣firming, that during the speace of above nineteen years wherein she li∣ved his wife, she never gave him the least cause of disgust; but that he received much constant content from her agreeable and complasant conversation; and much benefit from her frequent, prudent, and pious counsels; and most of all from her exemplar practises: And I am sure no person whatsoever, whether domestick, or other, whe∣ther of the same Religion or a dif∣ferent, had any difficulty to believe him; For so high was the esteem of her virtues amongst all, that e∣very
ones mouth was full of her praises; And one Noble person (though of a different Religion) who made a condoling Visit to my Lord after her death, speaking in the general language, used by all, when she was the Theme of the discourse, said to him, that he had no just cause to grieve for one who lived like a Saint upon earth, and now shined like an Angel in heaven. Her last sickness and Death. AS her whole life was spent to∣tally (in a manner) in succes∣sive acts of piety, and devotion, so did it please Almighty God in re∣compence of her virtue, to grant her a most happy, and Christian∣like conclusion of it. Her very last employments, before she was consi∣ned to her dying Chamber and bed, was a whole night (to wit, that of Christmasse) spent, according to
her custome, in acts of devotion, she then joyning like a dutiful childe with her holy Mother the Catholick Church, in celebrating the birth of the Saviour of the world, and having then with her wonted pious preparation received the holy Eucharist. Immediately after so many hours spent in such exercises, going to retire to her rest, she found her self seised with a most unusual coldness, and with so violent an heart sickness, that she concluded it to be mortal; yet nevertheless as she had all her life shewed her self in a most exem∣plar manner a truly loving wife, so would she now give dying Testi∣monies of it; For neither would she quit my Lords chamber and Bed (which she conceived her self a∣bout to quit for good and all) nor yet give him any disturbance in it, but with all patience suppressed the
complaint of her sickness in silence, not permitting any the least noise to be made, by speech or otherwise, or her bed to be warmed, or any act of indulgence to be used to her self, that might tend to the disquieting of him, whom some indisposition had caused to retire sooner; but lay quietly, full of pains, and as full of acts of con∣firmity to the divine will, till he a∣waked; then imparting to him the dangerous condition wherein she conceived her self, and with that tenderness that became so truly in∣dulgent, and affectionate a parent, recommending her children to his favour and care, she desired in com∣pliance with that obligation which lay upon her, to make use of those means which God hath appointed for the preservation of health, that Phisitians might be sent for, which my Lord being struck to the heart with that sad Good morrow she had given him, did not fail to do with
all diligence, as knowing too well how much it concerned him to pre∣serve so great a treasure. And though she had by my Lords care the constant attendance of two or three of the ablest Doctors then in Oxford (London being at too great a distance) and that they at the beginning seemed hopeful of her recovery, and failed not in the ap∣plication of all those Remedies their Art could suggest; yet it pleased God to render their endeavours in∣effectual; for the violence of her sickness encreased so fast upon her, that according to her own opinion, who by his Divine permission had taken a righter measure of her own Infirmity then they had, it proved the means of freeing her within a few days, of all the cares that at∣tend a transitory life. Her pains were extream, seasing
her in the most sensible part (the prime seat of life) her heart, and her patience was equal; for she was never heard to complain of, or la∣ment her condition; but whensoever she was asked concerning it, her on∣ly answer was, as it pleased God; upon whom her heart was wholly fixed: and in continuall applicati∣ons of her self to him, and in fer∣vent prayers to implore his mercy and grace, the whole time of her sickness was spent. On the last day whereof, being the feast of the Holy Innocents, she received Extream Unction with ad∣mirable devotion, being so present to her self, as to answer exactly to the Lytanies, and to reach out her own hands to be annointed. The next day being the feast of St. Thomas of Canterbury, that famous Martyr and Champion of the Church,
(a day that was ever wont to be spent by her in a manner totally in devotion) about six of the Clock in the morning, just precisely at the conclusion of those devout prayers (called the Recommendation of the soul) used by the Catholick Church in the last Agonies of her children, did this great Servant of God end this mortal life, giving up her soul to him, whom she ever loved, served, and obeyed with her whole heart, as hath been (I suppose) sufficiently evidenced by many most remarkable and undeniable testimo∣nies. And I think I may without diffi∣culty gain credit, when I shall tell you, how universal a consort of La∣mentation there was in all that Fa∣mily, at the approach of her death, when every one was considering how great a loss they were to un∣dergoe; not any but sensibly shared
in this affliction, seeing no children could have a more tender or careful Mother, no servants a more Indul∣gent or charitable Mistress, nor no Husband a more affectionate, and obe∣dient Wife. After her Death it appeared evi∣dently to those who had the ordering of her body for buriall, that she had not only made a righter judgment of her danger, then her Physitians, but also of the quality of her Infir∣mity, which shewed it self by the great evacuation of bloud at her mouth, to have been an Imposthume; she having several times, some years before, intimated that she conceived, that there was one gathering about, or near her heart, where she felt her greatest torment. She lived 36 years, 2 months, and 26 days, and her Corps were with all convenient decency carried
to Albrington in Shropshire, a Town belonging to the now Earles of Shrewsbury, and the usuall place of Sepulture of that branch of that fa∣mily, unto which that Earldome hath been descended these four last generations, and there it was inter∣red in a Church dedicated to God in honour of St. Thomas of Canterbury, upon whose Feast she died, and laid in the self-same Vault with that of the late most Learned and holy George Earl of Shrewsbury, formerly mentioned, whose virtues she did so effectually imitate. She left behinde her 4 Sons and 3 Daughters (having buried 2 Sons during her life) to wit, the Lord George Tallbot, who died in his youth∣ful age, and inherited the heroicall spirit of his great Name, but left no issue behinde him; Francis the second Son, Earl after his Father, a Gentle∣man generally esteemed by all wor∣thy
persons, and as much lamented by all such; who hath left issue, Charles the present hopeful Earl, and one other Son, and a Daughter the picture both in her face and humour of her Father: Edward the third Son kill'd in the late Civill Wars in the service of his King at the Battle of York; and Gilbert the fourth and youngest Son still living. Her 3 Daughters were the Lady Frances, the Lady Katherine, and the Lady Mary, all were most praise∣worthy for their excellent dispositions and virtuous comportments; the two first dyed in their young age without issue; the Lady Mary is still living, and hath issue one Son by her first husband (the grandchild by the Fa∣thers side of Thomas Lord Arundell of Wardour, and Count Imperial, and by the Mothers of the Lord Viscount Montacute) and both Sons and Daugh∣ters by her second husband the bro∣ther
and heir apparent of James Lord Studly and Earl of Castle-haven. Gods holy Name be blessed for having given her the Grace to leade so holy a life, and make so happy an end, and may we by his grace and favour through the mercies of Christ profit by the example of her virtues. FINIS.
