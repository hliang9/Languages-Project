THE Armies Proposalls TO THE PARLIAMENT OF THE Common-wealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. LONDON, Printed, and are to be sold in Fleet-street, 1659.
TO THE Supream Authority OF THESE NATIONS, THE PARLIAMENT OF THE Common-wealth of England. The Humble Petitions and Proposals of the Officers under the Command of the Right Honorable the Lord Lambert, in the late Northern expedition. Humbly sheweth, THAT whereas we with o∣thers, who desire to fear the Lord in these Nations (though by our provocations we are ripe for destruction) have been again saved by the Lord, and have had a late view of his appearances as of old, in the beholding of whose gracious footsteps as we cannot but re∣joyce,
so our souls tremble least the fruit and birth of all (which the Lord may expect, and his people long earnestly for) become abortive now in the day of our deliverance; we do therefore present unto your Honors consideration, these ensuing Proposals which we do humbly lay be∣fore you. I. That the Humble Petition and Address of the General Counsel of Officers at Wallingford-house to the Parliament, which was so unani∣mously and cheerfully agreed unto, and approv∣ed of in a day of our greatest confusions, may not be laid asleep, but may have fresh life given unto it; It being (upon further and cleerer grounds) still upon our hearts as the best and on∣ly expedient, yet offered (notwithstanding many assayes) to a happy and durable settlement be∣ing a fixed and firm fence and boundary (un∣der God) for the securing of the Civil and Spi∣ritual Liberties, which the Spirit of the Nation is unwearied in travil, not onely to invade, but up∣on every opportunity (as we we have often seen, and lately had a cleer evidence of) is ready to attempt the ruin and destruction of the same. II. That whereas God having given a Spirit to the Army sixed and faithful to the interest of his people, and our good old cause, when many who had been friends, were either Apostates, Malig∣nants or Newters, joyning with the old Enemy, leaving the Parliament and Army, and their few active friends singly to conflict with their late difficulties, and having now no such hopeful way,
like to prevail, and ruin, and frustrate what we have so long contended for, as by working divi∣sions in the Army, making breaches, begetting misunderstandings, and dissolving its Union (wherein, under God, it's strength lies) We do therefore as the most effectual means, for the maintaining of the Discipline and conduct there∣of, and preserving its Union inviolable, humbly Propose, That his Excellency the Lord Fleetwood may be settled Commander in chief of the Armies, his Commission expiring within a few months; That the Lord Lambert be the General Officer, and chief Commander of the Army next under him: Also that General Desbrough be the chief Officer of the horse under them, and that Gene∣ral Monck be the chief Officer of the Infantry, they being persons, under whose conduct, cour∣age, and fidelity, we have had eminent success, victories and deliverances in the days of great straits, and have been signally blest and owned by the Lord, to whom, and not to man be the honor of all. III. That having had very sad experiences of a grand Apostatizing and Newteral Spirit gone through the Nations, and amongst many of those who were intrusted for the safety thereof, very few acting or appearing in several Counties, for the preventing the Plots, and suppressing the powers of the enemy in their late Rebellious de∣sign; and many others not onely faultering, but falling in with them, were by a total ruin, was threatned, and had been effected, had not the
Lord in mercy prevented it. We therefore hum∣bly Propose, that there may be a diligent inquiry in all parts by faithful men, imployed to that pur∣pose, what intrusted Persons have been guilty of any contrivance, or acted against the Common∣wealths interest, and that they may be proceed∣ed against accordingly; and likewise what per∣sons upon wicked purposes have been Newteral in such a distracted day, when their assistance accor∣ding to their imployments and trust, would have been no less useful then seasonable; and that all such may be removed from their places and im∣ployments, Civil and Military, and that such who on the contrary have in this juncture of your discomposed affairs, declared their owning of this interest, either in the County Troops, Militia, Volanteers, or otherways, may be look∣ed upon as friends, incouraged, satisfied, their Arrears protected from injuries, countenanced by you, and as they are capacitated, invested with authority in their several Countries. IV. That in the late Insurrections, some con∣siderable Corporations have not onely added, a∣betted, and countenanced the enemies designs, but also have made use of the Armes lodged with them, and themselves appeared in the rebellion, willingly receiving the numerous affections of all engaged therein: Therefore we humbly propose, That such Corporations may be discountinan∣ced, and that you would be pleased to give your signal mark of disfavor against them; as also for the future, so to regulate Corporations, that
such persons well qualified according to the Go∣vernment of a well constituted Common-wealth may be invested with the authority of Magistracy in every Town, that so the footsteps of Monar∣chy may be rased out. V. We humbly offer, that all persons whatso∣ever, Magistrates, Ministers, or others, who have openly, or secretly stirred up, or provoked the inhabitants of these Nations to war and com∣motion against the Parliament, and particular to the late Insurrections, which is too visibly appa∣rent, many of them having not onely been abet∣ters, but in their persons appeared with instru∣ments and weapons of war (as some of us know) may be proceeded against, as you in your judge∣ments think fit. FINIS.
