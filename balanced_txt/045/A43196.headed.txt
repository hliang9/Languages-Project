HEALING QVERIES FOR SICK CHVRCHES. That is, Some seasonable thing begun, whereby the Present Breaches in Churches may be Repaired: Future Rents and Divisions prevented; and so all the Lords People have Communion not in darknesse but LIGHT. PUBLISHED, By a FRIEND to the Virgin Daughter of Zion. Jer. 8. 22. Is there no Balm in Gilead? Is there no Physitian there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? London, Printed in the Year, 1658.
To all the GATHERED CHVRCHES in England, Scotland and Ireland, PEACE with HOLINES be wished. Men, Fathers and Brethren, I May say in Jacobs words: Why do ye look one upon ano∣ther? Behold I have heard that there is Corn in Aegypt, Gen. 42. 12. Parents as they are deeply affected with their Childrens afflictions: so they are carefull to use what means they can for their recovery. It is very pious and Christian, for the divisions of Reuben there be great thoughts of heart. Indeed our eyes cannot weep enough for the breaches among brethren: yet this is but part of our duty. Get thee up (saith God to Joshua) wherefore lyest thou upon thy face? Josh. 7. 10. Not blaming him for his mourning, but telling him there was more work to be done. There are three Reasons (which I shall name) why I have published these Queries. First, that they may be of some use to Pastours and Teachers of Churches: who are most concerned in seeking to heale the breaches among them. Now I do not see away more probable for healing, than to look into the Cause of their differences. As for example, when some Brethren are not satisfied about the place of TRIERS; cannot comfortably joyn in communion with Souldiers: Nor with such as have civill Offices under the present Go∣vernment: think it a PUBLIKC SCANDALL to Religion, that Church-members should be Jaylors and Judges of the Saints; and
shew no cause why they persecute them: Here it is the Ministers duty in a speciall manner to appear, where such offences are taken. And by sound Doctrine prove (if he can) that these scruples and questions do arise through the ignorance, and weaknes of the Brethren, and that they are offences taken, but not given. Secondly, Of some use to such Brethren as desire to keep themselves pure, and not be partakers of other mens sins: I hope without any fur∣ther enlargment, those who know what it is not to defile their gar∣ments, God will inable them to make a fruitfull improvement of these Queries. Thirdly, Because I do intend to prosecute this subject about Chur∣ches a little further; These Queries concern Churches already con∣stituted: But I have something to publish for their sakes, who are not yet in Church fellowship. Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to Harvest, Joh. 4. 35. Here I shall shew (so far as may be hinted by Queries:) first, what things are necessary that Saints agree upon as uniting principles: secondly, what things (as differences) may be born with: thirdly, what Opinions and pra∣ctises are destructive to the peace and growth of Churches, which here∣after shall be constituted. Because of the house of Jehovah our God, I will seek good for thee, Psal. 122. 9. But in the queries one thing I forgot; Whereas some Church Offi∣cers a while since took great liberty and boldness to write against the misdemeanour of the late King, and in their Sermons, had often that Text, Judg. 5. 23. Curse ye Meroh, &c. What is the reason that Do∣ctrine is now laid aside? I move this question, to the end that such who are herein concerned may vindicate themselves: For it is gene∣rally said, if that which they wrote and preacht against the King, had been done sincerely, and in the fear of God, they would now by Preach∣ing and Writing, as earnestly perswade people to lcome forth to the help of the Lord against the mighty, as they did then. The close is thus, so that I may be any way usefull for the overthrow∣ing of Iniquity, in Church and State, and the advancement of righte∣ousness in both, I have my end: With me it is a very small thing to be judged of mans judgment: my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.
Healing Queries for sick Churches. Question I. WHether in a Church rightly constituted, every member is not alike under the power of Christ, given to the Church; that is, whosoever breaks the known laws of Christ, ought to be admonished and dealt with according to Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, . 16. 17. 1 Thess. 3. 14. Levit. 19. 17. Gal. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 1. 20. Quest. II. Whether such Church Members as know any of their Brethren (in the same fellowship with them) walk disorderly to the dishonour of God, the scandal of Religion, and hardning wic∣ked men in their sins; do not wrap themselves in the sin and guilt of their Brethren; yea, and are murderers before God, if they seek not to reclaim them, according to the Rules of the Gospel, Lev. 19. 17. with 1 Joh. 3. 15. Ezec. 3. 18. Jam. 5. 19. 20. Gal. 6. 1. Quest. III. If a Brother or Brethren sin openly, and the same is known to the whol Church, but the Church useth not the means and way, which Christ hath appointed for the humbling and re∣covering of such scandalous members: The question is, whether the whole Church be not leavened, and her holy things polluted? yea, further, it may be queried by what Gospel promise such a People can expect the presence of Christ in the midst of them, so long as they remain thus rebellious against the Lord, and the whol lump leavened: 1 Tim. 5. 20. Hag. 2. 12, 13, &c. 1 Cor. 5. 6. Isa. 1. 11. to 17. Josh. 7. 12. Hab. 1. 13. Jer. 7. 8, 9. Gen 35. 2, 3, 4. Amos 3. 3. Quest. IV. Whether Churches are to take Cognizance of the Sins mentioned by Paul in 2 Tim. 3. 2, 3, &c. and more particular∣ly, whether it be their duty to enquire and judge, who are the Traitours and Covenant breakers, there foretold to be in the last dayes; briefly, whether Churches, (as Churches) ought to judge the Actions of their members in civill things, that is, about the lawfulness of mens Callings, Places, Offices, Administrations,
Maintenance? suppose it be State Affairs, (as they call it) what hath the Church to do with her members in such a case? 1 Cor. 6. 2. 1 Thes. 4 6. Phil. 4. 8. 1 Cor. 10. 32. 33. 2 Tim. 4. 5. Rev. 2. 2. Heb. 10. 24. Quest. V. Whether such Church members walk not scanda∣lously and bring a publick dishonour to the Name of God, who joyn and act with the open Enemies of the Gospel against the Saints; that is, persecute their Brethren, apprehend them, and cast them into prison, will be their Judges and Jaylors, and yet have no matter of Crime to lay to their charge? If so, whether then it be not a great sin and shame to that Church, who keeps in her bosom any open persecutors of the Lords people, Psal. 50. 18. Obe. v. 11, 12, 13, &c. Mat. 24. 48, 49, 50. Act. 9. 4, 5, Mat. 25. 39, 40 43, 45. Ps, 93. 5 1 Pet. 2. 12 Quest. VI. In case the greater number of a Church shall tolerate and allow apparent sin, in some members, and not deal with them for the same? what is the duty of the other part (howsoever the lesser) knowing the walking of such members to be very scanda∣lous and sinfull (and yet born with by the greater number) that they may keep themselves pure, and not be partakers of others mens sin. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 2 Tim. 3. 2. 3. 5. Hos. 11. 12. 1. Tim. 5. 22. Hos. 2. 2. Rev. 3. 4. Or thus, If known scandalous persons are in a Church, and the Church is dealt with for suffering the same? whether that Church may lawfully be left and separated from, by Brethren (many or few, yet so as the lesser number) who have used all due means and wayes (so far as their duty is) to have the Church pur∣ged of such defilements? but the Major part will not heare, but rather abets the sinners and justifies the wicked? Again, if the greater number in such a case may be left, the question is whether as a true Church, or a company of Rebels, and the visible Church. State remain with the better part, though fewer in number, Rev. 2. 5. Jer. 7. 11, 12. Mat. 21. 13 Eccles. 9. 18. 2 Chro. 15. 2. Prov. 17. 15. Jer. 28. 16. Quest. VII. Whether a Church lying under the guilt of much sin should not please God far more to execute justice and judge∣ment, that is, purge out the old leaven, and destroy the accursed from among them, than to pray, preach, fast, break bread, &c. Yea more, so long as judgment is neglected, and nothing done against scan∣dalous walkers? where is there any promise that the Lord will
accept of their sacrifices, as Prayer, Preaching, Fasting, &c. Prov. 21. 3. 1 Sam. 15. 22. &c. Isa. 1. 11 Hos. 6. 6. Mic. 6. 6, 7, 8. Isa. 33. 5. Mic. 3. 10, 11, 12. Jer. 7. 21. 23. Mat. 23. 23, 24. Mat. 5. 23, 2. Rev. 2. 12. Jam. 4. 8. 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Quest. VIII. Seeing it is well known how the Churches have been charged with Apostacy publickly to the world, and in them (as it is asserted) the second Apostacy is fulfilled, set down in 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2, &c. It is queried, why some thing is not published for their vindication; Besides it is desired that they will declare, 1. What Apostacy that is of which Paul there speaks, 2. To what time it is to be applied, 3. How it doth appear that such Churches as are fal∣len in with the present Government, have not by it made that A∣postacy. 4. What is meant by these words in the Text from such turn a side, 2 Pet. 3. 15. Josh. 22. 10, 11. Tit. 1. 9. Act. 11. 2, 3, 4. &c. Quest. IX. Whether such Pastors and Teachers of Churches, as joyn with this present Government, and have much worldly ad∣vantage by it; do not by their silence shew either great ingrati∣tude to their Lord Protector, being as they say a nursing Father to them (if they can justifie the Power and Government which he hath taken up:) or otherwise, whether they give not just occasion unto People to think they cannot justifie him, by Law, Reason, Religion, &c. and so it is rather of coveteousness than Consci∣ence, that they are faln in with him; besides by their silence, whe∣ther they deal not the more unworthily with their Nursing father, (if they can defend him) considering they well know, how the most conscientious Christians in the Nation are altogether dissa∣tisfied about the present Government. Prov. 27. 10. & 22. 1. Quest. X. Whereas that place Rom. 13. 1, 2, &c. is by our Bre∣thren often brought against us (as they know it was once the spe∣ciall objection of Royalists against them and us,) Let every soule be subject to the higher powers, &c. Here we shall propose a few things, 1. If the higher powers must be submitted too, because they are or∣dained of God, and are Gods Ordnanceiv. whether it be not meant, so far as they are lawfully constituted, & do govern according to reason and just laws, preserve their peoples Liberties, Persons and Estates; Again, when they prove Traitors to the Nation, and are the Devils Agents, whether they may not be severely punished
for it. 2. Because these who resist lawfull authority and just commands receive to themselves condemnation; it be not a non sequitur; Ergo, Usurpers must be submitted too, and unjust commands obeyed. 3. Rulers must be obeyed, because they are not a terror to good works but to evill, v. 3. Whether this be a good consequence, when they are profest enemies to good works, and do evill continually with both hands; therefore they must be obeyed. 4. Seeing the Magistrate is to be obeyed, because he bears not the sword in vain, he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evill, v. 4. Here the query may be, if he seek to ruin, spoil, and enslave the people, gives liberty to all manner of unrighte∣ousnes, bears the sword not onely in vain, in reference to the pub∣lick good, but draws it forth upon those that are good, and be∣cause they are good, whither it be the intendment of this text, therefore he must be obeyed. 5. Whither that which is not the Ordi∣nance of God, but rather of the Devill, and the meer sin, and pre∣sumption of men, is within the compasse of this Text. 6. Whe∣ther that which is no point or part of the Magistrates lawfull po∣wer ordained of God, but Diametrically repugnant to it, as Tyran∣ny, Oppression, Violence, &c. is within the Verge of this Text, and to be obeyed for conscience fake. 7. Whether all the powers intended in the text, said to be ordained of God, are not circumscri∣bed and bounded with certain rules of Law, Justice, and Honesty, within which they must contain themselves, and if they passe be∣yond those limits, they are none of Gods Ordinances; Consider of it, take advise and speak your mindes. Judg. 19. 30. Prov. 22. 21. Quest. XI. Whereas one special cause of the present differences divisions, and rents in Churches, is this; namely, That souldiers and others, who have places under the present Government (being Church members) are not called to an account as evill doers: The question is, whether it be not the duty of Churches, (especially the Officers) for the satisfaction of their offended Brethren, to give some rea∣sons, that howsoever there is offence taken at Souldiers and o∣ther State Officers, yet they have the word of God to warrant their practise in holding communion with them, Isa. 8. 20. 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17 Tit. 1. 9. 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25. Acts 20 2. 2 Cor. 1. 4. 1 Thess. 2. 7, 8, &c.
Quest. XII. In like manner, where as it is well known that the place of Tryers. (as it is commonly called) hath given offence to many pretious Christians, and occasioned much trouble in some Churches, no lesse than division; the query is, whether it be not the Duty of such TRIERS as are Church-members to prove (if they can) what they act in that particular business to be lawfull by the Word of God, 1 Cor. 10. 32, 33. 1 Pet. 5. 2, 3. 1 Cor. 8. 12, 13. & 9. 22, 23. 1 Thess. 5. 22. 1 Joh. 2. 10. Isa. 57. 14. 2 Cor. 8. 21 & 13. 7. Quest. XIII. Whereas in the dayes of the late King, many ho∣nest men for refusing to submit to an Arbitrary Power, and Ille∣gall Taxes, and standing for the Rights and Liberties of the Peo∣ple, suffered very much in their Liberties and Estates, and were counted for it, Good Patriots to their Country: The question is, if in Churches there are some Persons, who shall promote an Arbi∣trary Power, and seek to destroy the civill Rights and Liberties of the People? whether this be not a Scandall to Religion, and a matter which the Church is to take notice off, and to deal with such members as offenders, 1 Cor. 6. 8, 9. 1 Tim. 1. 13. Job 24. 2. Psal. 50. 18. Deut. 19. 14. & 27 17. Prov. 22. 28. Phil. 4 8. 1 Thess, 4. 12. Quest. XIV. Whether in all Ages the Lord hath not had some glorious work proper to every Generation;* Whereas Mr. William Bridge, preaching lately at the Charterhouse, May 23. 1658. Told his Hearers, That there is now a Gene∣ration work, a generation Truth, and generation Sins. Whether it be not the du∣ty of all Pastors and Tea∣chers, clearly to declare unto their people, when the proper Work, Truth & Sins are of this generation. Psal. 40. 10. Jer. 23. 28. Rom. 1. 18. if so, what is the Work now, as most proper to the Saints of this Generation; Acts 13. 36. 2 Tim. 3. 1. 5. Or thus, whether to bear wit∣ness to and for the glorious and visible King∣dome of Jesus Christ, and to hold forth a pub∣lick Testimony against the present Powers of the World, that they shall be all broken to pieces, and the Lord alone exalted as King of Saints and Nations; be not now a Work more proper to the Churches and People of God than it was to Saints in former Ages; Dan. 2. 44 & 7. 13, 14. & 12. 8, 9, 10. Rev. 22. 10. Act. 1. 6, 7. Isa. 35. 5. Quest. XV. Whereas Rev. 11. 16. There is mention made of the twenty foure Elders, but the foure living Creatures, are left out of the Text; The question is, whether it may not probably be
concluded from the place, (comparing our present experience with it) that neer or about the expiration of the Fourth Monarchy, when the Kingdoms of this world, are to become the kingdomes of our Lord and his Christ; there will be a generall declining of Church-Officers from the work of that Generation, and the Brethren, (not in Office) more faithfull than their Pastors and Teachers, in holding forth a publick Testimony to the glorious Kingdom and and Reign of Christ, Psal. 8. 2. Isa. 26. 2. Jer. 50. 45. 1 Cor. 1. 26, 27. Isa. 29. 9. 10, 11, 12. 18. & 43. 27. Rev. 12. 4. Joel 3. 15, 16. Quest. XVI. Whereas the late divisions and rents in many Churches have risen from Souldiers and others, who have places un∣der the present Government; It be not necessary that all Churches (as yet free from the occasion of such trouble) do well consider what they do, before they admit Souldiers and others (so much excepted against) into Church Fellowship? Again, for others who either intend to joyn to some Church already gathered, or to constitute themselves a Church? Whether it do not likewise ve∣ry much concern them to avoid that thing which others have been so much prejudiced by: As a wise man will not run his Ship upon that rock, on which he sees another Vessel is split before his eyes. Prov. 22. 3. Ezra 4. 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 5. 6. Quest. XVII. Whether Churches in such a day as this is, should not make diligent enquiry, what it is that hinders their glory and growth? What it is that keeps the bad in, and the good out? whence it is that they do not experience so much life, sweetnesse, and divine Presence in Church Ordinances as formerly they did? Again, would they be conscientious, and sincere in searching for the cause? then, whether it would not be found: First, Negli∣gence in some Officers, who look more after the world than after the walking of their Flock, and seek to keep up state and pompe in their own Family, more than purity and holines in the house of God. Secondly, Arrogancy and Pride in some Members who be∣ing Statesmen, are like the Sons of Zerviah, too hard for the rest: For through fear some dare not speak to them of their scandalous walking; others by gifts and preferment have their mouths stopt,
though not their consciences, others care not for it, as if (Caa∣like) they were not their brothers keeper, Thus though the wicked∣nes of some Church members be like Gehazis leprosie upon the fore head of the Church; and the world cryes shame on it; yet the Church hath neither an ear to hear, nor an ey to see, Lam. 3. 40. Josh. 7. 5, 6. 2 Cor. 7. 9, 10, 11. Ezec. 3. 4, 5, &c. Mat. 18 7. Quest. XVIII. Whether unfaithfulness among Churches in neglecting their Christian Duty each to other, that is, not admo∣nishing one another of the great corruption, which they see crept into Churches (especially the deceitfull walking of some Church-Officers, who were winked at, when they openly sought by LET∣TERS and other wayes to corrupt the Churches) hath not (by the just hand of God) brought many troubles and divisions upon them: Again, if a Church be corrupted by suffering scandalous persons in it, what is the Duty of a Sister Church knowing the same to, be true? And how far, and how long may a Church hold communion with any Church, which keeps scandalous per∣sons in communion howsoever admonished of it. Quest. XIX. Whether the stop, that hath been put to the Lords work, and the good old Cause once famous in the three Nations, with what present oppression and persecution is amongst us: hath not been raised and continued in a speciall manner, by some Church-members; And whether such Church members have not been more false to the Interest of Christ and his People, then any o∣ther people, and betrayed the most glorious Cause that ever was in the world. Jer. 11. 15. Quest. XX. Whether Pride and Covetousness (so much con∣demned in holy Scripture) are sins to be born with in Churches? If not, what is the reason that few (if any) Church members, though never so apparently proud and Coveteous are called to an account for such sins. Besides, whether for Pride and Coveteous∣nesse, some WITHIN do not far exceed most WITHOƲT; Prov. 8. 13 Hos. 5. 5. 1 Joh. 2. 16. Isa. 2. 12. Mal. 3. 15. 2 Tim. 3. 2. Jam. 4. 6. Psal. 10. 3. 1 Cor. 6 10. Ephes 5. 5. Luk. 12. 15. Col 3. 5. Isa. 5. 11. Ezec. 16. 48. 51. 1 Cor. 5. 4 Thou canst not bear them that do evill, Rev. 2. 2. Quest. XXI. Whereas the Name of God and Religion, lies under so much reproach everywhere, by reason of the Apostacy, Hypo-
hood of Professors; for many hereby are hindred from joyn∣ing to Churches: Others hardned in errour and sin; yea, many by this occasion are become Libertines, Blasphemers, Atheists, and what not? Query is, How far it is the duty of Churches, publick∣ly to appear in vindicating the great name of God, and wiping off that scandal and reproach which lies upon the truth & them too. Exo. 32. 32. Josh. 7. 9. & Psa. 122. 9. & 137. 5, 6. Numb. 25. 13. Joh. 2. 17. Neh. 2. 3. Prov. 22. 1. Quest. XXII. That some Brethren at this time not holding forth a faithfull Testimony, against the corruptions crept into the Churches, and shewing the Churches their evill and sin: so far as their light and duty is: whether this be not one great cause, that the abuses and corruptions now in Churches are not reformed? Further the Query is, In what souldanger that member is, who hath made a solemn Covenant before the Lord with his Brethren to practise all known Gospel order, Christian  & duties, both to the Church and every individuall member, shall notwithstanding (contrary to the light of his own conscience) break that Cove∣nant so solemnly made in the principall part of it. Prov. 14. 25. Ezek. 2. 7. Isa. 58. 1. Jer. 23. 22. Ephe. 17. 15, 16, 17, 18. Rom. 1. 31. Psal. 15. 4. Rom. 21. 27. and 22. 15. 1 Joh. 3. 20. Ruth. 3. 18. Isa. 30. 9. and 63. 8. Quest. XXIII. Our last Query shall be; first, Whether there be not good ground to think, when the Lord shall bring forth his judgements against the Nations of the world, he will begin at his own house; Jer. 25. 18. 29. Eze. 9. 6. Amo. 3. 2. 1 Pet. 4. 17. Secondly, Whether the Lords controversie at this time against Churches, be not their neglect of judgement? Isa. 59. 4. 9. 14, 15. Thirdly, Whether there be any way (following the Word of God) for Churches to escape publique judgments, than to purge out unclean persons and things? Josh. 7. 13. 26. 2 Sam. 21. 14. Rev. 2. 5. 16. J. 1. 15. FINIS.
