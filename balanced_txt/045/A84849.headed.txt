THE LORD GENERAL'S LETTER To the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of LONDON, Concerning the ARMIEs advance up to the City of London; and desiring the Advance of 40000 li. presently, for pay of the ARMY. My Lord, and Gentlemen, BEing upon an immediate advance with the Army to∣wards London, we thought good hereby to give you no∣tice thereof; For the grounds and necessity leading us hereunto, we referre you to our late Remonstrance, and to our late Declaration concerning the same. We have only this further to adde, that as we are far from the least thought of plunder or other wrong to your City, or any the places adjoyning (which we hope your former experiences of us will give you cause enough to credit us in,) so for the better prevention of any disorder in the Souldiery, or of any abuse or inconvenience to the inhabi∣tants in the quartering of the Souldiery at private houses; wee ear∣nestly desire, that you would take a present course for the supply of Money to pay those Forces, while wee shall be necessitated to stay there, upon which we assure you we shall so dispose of them into great and void houses about the City as much as may be possible, as that few or none of the inhabitants shall be troubled with quarter∣ing of any Souldiers at all. And for this purpose we desire, That forty thousand pound may be forthwith provided upon the securi∣ty of your Arrears to be ready to be paid out to the Forces to mor∣row night if possible. And wee shall be ready to receive from you any intimations for the further prevention of hurt, or inconvenience to the City in this businesse, I remaine Windsor, ult. Novemb. 1648. Your Lordships most assured friend and servant, T. FAIRFAX. For the Right Honourable the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-councell of the City of London. 1 Decemb. 1648. Imprimatur. Gil. Mabbot. London, Printed for Lawrence Blaiklocke. 1648.
