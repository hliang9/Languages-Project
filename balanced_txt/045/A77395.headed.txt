I Shall not trouble you with the Narrative of the many pious actions of this noble Lord in his minority: he was much beloved of the Commons, he had a publique spirit, his expe∣rience was great: hee travelled beyond the seas, and acted well at home. When times began to be reformed, he was made a Privy Counsellor; and the King raising Fores a∣gainst the Parliament, this good Earle was looked on with great affection, and England had great hopes to be eased by him, for none was more in the affections of the people. Iuly 12. 1642. The Parliament being acquinted that the King had besieged Hull, with many Horse and Foot, that his Forces were trenching themselves, and had 24 peeces of Canon to plant against the Towne, both Houses voted the 22. of Iuly 1642.

The Parliament having placed Deputy-Lieutenants for the se∣verall Counties of the Kingdome, gave Commissions to the Earle of Pembrooke, E. of Stamford, the Lord Say, Lord Brookes, Lord Roberts, Lord Willoughby of Parham, and others.

His Majesty came against Warwicke, and playd against the City with Batteries, and Prince Rupert landed at New∣castle with Armes from beyond Sea, and the Commission of Array was laboured for in Kent, but prevented: a party of Horse & Foot being sent by his Excellency, took Cobham house, the Block-houses at Gravesend, the Bridge at Rochester, and Dover Castle, and se∣cured other parts of the County.

The Funerall Elegie, of the Obiets of his Excellency Robert Earle of Essex. VVHat dismall accident is fall'n of late. That fills with grief our Kingdome & the State? Sure it must be some universall blow, That makes a Sea of teares the land ore-slow. Or as and Earth-quake had great Brittaine shooke. Men are amaz'd, or else seeme Plannet strooke.
This weeping deluge, this eyes inundation, Bewrayes some mighty blow is given our Nation. T'is so, and such a stroke cannot befall On one the like whom we a Subject call. And therefore reader, if thou knowst not why Sad sorrow hath possessed each mans eye Then know that griefe this Land hath over-spread, Upon distracted thoughts of Essex dead. Oh! 'tis too true: have we not reason then, To mourn untill we have his like again? Two Kingdomes (next unto the King) 'tis knowne, On this good Peere had their affections thrown. But what avails high Eminence and Place. The Kingdomes favour, and the peoples grace? These are supports, but no preheminence Gainst Death, to be a Buckler or Defence. For why? If any, or if all of these Could have put by this blow, or given some ease To this lov'd Lord, there's few within this Land, But would have lent him both a heart and hand. But he hath made a happy change in this, An earthly Earldome for a Crown of Blisse. He liv'd well, purposely to dye well too. And as his purpose was he so did doe. Death brings good men where good men should abide, If wicked men were good, they should have dy'd. We take our turnes, it skills not where or when, Provided that we dye to live againe. Scotland a friend, London an Interest. In this maine losse is too too manifest. You Souldiers that good Essex did attend, Let these lines to your sorrowes solace send. That though you have a curelesse cause of care. Yet in your griefes three Kingdom's beare a share. And in sweete peace let rest his noble Dust. untill the Resurrection of the just. When Soule aad Body both conjoyn'd againe. In never ending glory shall remaine.
FINIS.
