THE STATE OF A CHRISTIAN, lively set forth by an Allegorie of a Shippe under Sayle.Prov. 31.14. Iob 9.26. Isay 23.1. Rev. 8.9. MY Body is the Hull; the Keele my backe; my Necke the Stem; the Sides are my Ribbes; the beames my bones; my flesh the plankes; Gristles and ligaments are the Pintells and knee-timbers; Arteries, veines and sinewes the severall seames of the shippe; my blood is the ballast; my heart the principall hold; my stomack the Cooke-roome; my Liver the Cesterne; my Bowells the sinke; my Lungs the Bellowes; my teeth the Chopping-knives, except you divide them, and then they are the 32. points of the Sea-card both agreeing in number; Concoction is the Caldron; and hunger the Salt or sawce; my belly is the lower Decke; my kidnies Close Cabbins or receptacles; my thighes are long Galleries for the grace of the ship; my armes and hands the Canhookes, my midriffe is a large Parti∣tion or Bulk-head; within the circumference of my head is placed the Stee∣ridge roome and chiefe Cabbins, with the Round house where the Master lyeth, and these for the more safety and decency are inclosed with a dou∣ble fence, the one Dura mater something hard and thicke, the other Pia mater very thinne and soft, which serveth in stead of hangings; The eares are two doores or Scuttles, fitly placed for entertain∣ment; the two Eyes are Casements to let in light; under them is my mouth the Stowidge or Stewards roome; my lippes are Hatches for receit of goods; my two Nostrills serve as Gratings to let in ayre; at the one end stands my chin which is the Beakehead; my forehead is the upper decke; all which be∣ing trimmed with my fat in stead of pitch, and haire in stead of Ockham, are coloured with my skinne. The fore-decke is humility; the stearne Charity; active obedience the sailes; which being hoysed up with the severall Yards, Halliers and Bow∣lings of holy precepts and good purposes, are let downe againe by fickle∣nesse, faintings, and inconstancy; Reason is my Rudder; experience the helme; hope of salvation my Anchor; passive obedience the Capstaine; holy Re∣venge the Cat and Fish to hawle the sheate Anchor or last hope; feare of of∣fending is the Buoy; vertues are the Cables; Holy desires and sodaine eja∣culations the shroudes; the zeale of Gods glory is my Maine-mast, preme∣ditation the foremast; desire of my owne salvation the Mizzen-mast; saving knowledge the Boltesprit; ircumspection a sounding line; my Light is illu∣mination, Iustice is the Card, Gods word the Compasse; the meditation of lifes brevity a Foure-houre glasse; Contemplation of the Creatures the Crosse-staffe or Iacobs staffe; the Creede a Sea grammer; the life of Christ my Load starre; the Saints falls are Sea-markes; Good examples Land-markes; Repen∣tance Pumps out the sinke of my sinnes; a good Conscience keepes mee cleane; imputative righteousnesse is my Flag, having this Motto (BEING CAST DOVVNE WE PERISH NOT) The Flage-staffe is sincerity; the ship is victualed afresh by reading, hearing, receiving; Bookes are Long-boates; Letters are little Sciffes to carry and recarry my spirituall merchandize; Per∣severance is my speede, and patience my name, my fire is lust, which will not be cleane extinguished; full feeding and strong drinke is the fuell to main∣taine it, whose flame (if it be not supprest) is jealousie; whose sparkes are evill words; whose ashes is envie; whose smoake is infamie; Lascivious talke is as flint and steele; Concupiscence as tinder, opportunity is the match to light it; Sloath and idlenesse are the Servants to prepare it. The Law of God is my Pilot; Faith my Captaine; Fortitude the Master; Chastity the Masters mate; my will the Coxen; Conscience the Preacher; Application of Christs death the Chirurgion; Mortification the Cooke; Vivi∣fication the Calker; Selfedeniall is an Apprentice of his; Temperance the Ste∣ward; Contentation his Mate; truth the Purser; thankefulnesse the Pursers mate; Reformation the Boatswain; The 4 humors, Sanguin, Choler, &c. are the Quarter masters; Christian vigilancy undertakes to supply the office of Starbord and Larborde watch; Memory is Clerke of the Checke; Assu∣rance the Corporall; the Armour Innocency; the Mariners Angels; Schis∣matickes are searchers sent aboard; my understanding as Master Gunner culls out from those two Budgecaskes of the New and old Testament cer∣raine threates and promises which is my onely powder and Shot; and with the assistance of the Gunners mate, holy anger against sinne, chargeth my tongue, which like to a peece of Ordnance shootes them to the shame and o∣verthrow of my spirituall Adversaries. My Noble Passengers are Ioy in the holy Ghost & the peace of Conscience, whose retinue are divine graces; my ignoble or rather mutinous passengers are wordly cogitations and vaine delights, which are more than a good many; besides some that are arrant theeves and traytors, namely pride, envie, pre∣judice▪ but all these ile bid farewell when I come to my journeis end, though I would but cannot before. Heaven is my Country, where I am registred in the Booke of life; my King is Iehovah; my tribute Almesdeeds; they which gather it are the poore; Love is my Countries badge, my language is holy conference; my fellow companions are the Saints. I am poore in performances, yet rich in Gods acceptation; The founda∣tion of all my good, is Gods free Election; I became bound into the Corpo∣ration of the Church to serve him in my baptisme; I was inrolled at the time when he first called me: my freedome is Iustification, it was purcha∣sed with the blood of Christ, my evidence is the earnest of his spirit; my priviledges are his sanctifying Graces; my Crowne (reserved for me on high) is Glorification. My Maker and Owner is God, who built me by his Word which is Christ, of earth which was the materiall: he fraught it with the essence of my soule which is the Treasure; and hath set me to saile in the sea of this world, till I attaine to the port of death, which letteth the terrestriall part into the harbour of the grave, and the celestiall into the kingdome of hea∣ven; in which voyage conveniencie of estate is as sea-roome; good affections serve as a tyde, and prayer as a a prosperous gale a winde to helpe for∣ward. But innumerable are the Impediments and perills; for here I meete with the proffers of unlawfull gaine, and sensuall delights as so many Sirens; the baites of prosperity (as high bankes) on the right hand or weathershore, and there with evill suggestions, and crabbed adversity (as Rockes) on the left hand or Lee-shore ready to split me; the feare of hell like quickesands threaten to swallow me; Originall sinne like weedes clog me, and actu∣all transgressions like so many Barnacles hang about me, yea every sinne I commit springs a new leake; my senses are as so many stormes of raine, haile and snow to sinke me; lewd affections are roaring billowes and waves; selfe-confidence or to rely upon any thing but divine assistance, is to lose the bolt-sprit; Restitution is heaving goods over board to save the ship; Melancholy, is want of freshwater; the scoffes of Atheists and contempt of religion in all places, is a notable becalming; the lewd lives and evill examples of the most a contagious ayre; Idlenesse furres it, and is a shrewd decay both of Hull and Tackling. Moreover sayling along and keeping watch (for they that are Christs friends you know must looke for all they meete to be their enemies) we no sooner looke up but presently we ken a man of warre, and then we must be for warre too, and provide for a skir∣mish. Now the Gallyon that hath our Pinnace in chase, and alwayes watcheth for advantages to surprise it, is the Piracy of hell, the synagogue of Sa∣than; her fraight is Temptations and persecutions, with all the Engines of mischiefe; in which the Devill is Master; mlice the Masters mate; cruelty the Captaine; Murder the Cooke; Flattery the Calker; profanenesse a quarter master; riot the Steward; never content his mate; pride the Cockeson; superstition the Preacher; hypocrisie the Boatswain; covetousnes the Purser; lust the Swabber; fury the Gunner; presumption the Corporall; sedition the Trumpeter; drunkennesse the Drummer; vices are the sayles; custome the Maine-mast; Example of the multitude the Foremast; Lusts and passions the Cables; blindnesse of mind the Rudder; hardnesse of heart the helme; the wisedome of the flesh the Card; the mystery of iniquity the Compasse; the five senses, or if you will scoffing Atheists, prophane fowle-mouthed drunkards, and all the rab∣ble of hell are the Marriners; lewd affections the Passengers; little con∣science the Load-starre, she hath two Tyre of great Ordnance planted in her, heresie and irreligion (being either for a false God or none) Oathes blasphemy and curses are the powder and shot, which they spit against all that worship the Lambe, or fight under the ensigne of faith; her armour is carnall security; the Flag in her top, is infidelity, the motto (There is no God but Gaine) Her ballast which keepes her upright, is ignorance; most of her tackling she has from Rome, and Amsterdam; Antichrist as Pilot, steares her in such a course that she goes on swiftly, proudly, securely, scorning and scoffing (Sennacharib like) to heare that any Lord should deliver this poore pinnace out of her hands; yet in the sequell this silly Pinke having the insurance of Gods omnipresence, findes not only succour from the Stock of the Churches prayers, which like another Merchant man comes in to the rescue, but likewise that Gods Almighty power and providence is neare at hand as a strong Castle of defence to free her, whereby she escapes even as a bird out of the snare of the hunter, to prayse the Lord, who hath not given her as a pray unto their teeth, that would have swallowed up all quicke, but delivered her from such swelling waters, flouds of affliction, and streames of persecution, as else had gone over her, and even drowned her soule, as it is Psalme 124, while this great Gallion (though, it seeme like that Invincible Armado) flyes, and (having no Anchor) when the stormes of Gods wrath arise, downe she sinkes to desperation, and perisheth in the bottomlesse pit or burning lake of fire and brimstone, where weele leave her to receive a just recompence of reward.
