And that the poorer sort may be first provided for, with speciall direction to the Committee of Lords and Commons ap∣pointed for that service, to take care for the preventing of the cut∣ting downe and spoyling of mens woods by disorderly persons without any lawfull Authority, which hath beene, and is so much daily practised and complained of.

And that all Deputy Lieutenants, Iustices of the peace, and other Officers whom it shall concern, be required to take speciall care for the preventing hereof, and for the apprehending of such per∣sons who shall offend therein, that they may be brought to con∣digne punishment. And the severall owners of such woods are required to see this Order duly executed; and all owners of woods liable to the said Ordinance, are hereby strictly required and en∣joyned not to sell, cut down, or carry away any of the said woods liable to the said Ordinance, before the same be duly executed on paine of further answering their contempt herein to both Houses of Parliament. It is Ordered by the Committee of Lords and Commons, that this Order be printed, and published in all Parish-Churches and Chappels, by the Par∣sons, Vicars, or Curates of the same, within the compasse abovesaid.
