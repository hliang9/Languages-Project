To the Right Honourable, our right worthy and grave Senatours,  Lord MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and COMMONALTY of the City of LONDON, in Common Council assembled. e most humble PETITION and ADDRESSE of divers Young men, on the behalf of themselves and the APPRENTICES in and about this honourable City. Most humbly sheweth, IT hath pleased the good and only wise GOD for our and the Nations crying sins, to manifest His displeasure for many years together against these once flourishing, now sadly divided, distracted, and almost ruined Nations: and yet, blessed be GOD, this Honourable City hitherto hath been no proportionable sharer in the Calamities which our Brethren in other parts of these (now miserable) Nations have suffered; which are now aggravated by our Divisions, and such a general decay of Trading, as doth exceed the worst of former times; All which we look upon, as a most sad presage of some heavie and dismal Judgment very near at hand, if not our sudden ruine: together with the destruction and utter dissolution both of Church and State, which will inevitably ensue as a just reward upon our multiplied provocations, under the most signal manifestations of GOD'S most gracious presence, and the most engaging mercies that ever People did enjoy (unlesse it please our most gracious GOD, whose Name hath been exceedingly dishonoured by the Violation of sacred and solemn Oaths) amongst us to work our deliverance out of this contexture of dangerous mischiefs, into which we have already wound our s: or which, as the inundations of mighty waters, may suddenly break-in upon us: and being sadly sensible of the calamities, under which the three Na∣ groan for want of a well-ordered and established Government: We being Members in the same Political Body cannot but sympathize with the rest of Brethren: And forasmuch as your endeavours may contribute very much there to, and the well or ill management of your Talents, in the discharge of Trusts, may now make these Nations happy, or else leave them irrecoverably miserable: We hold our selves obliged in conscience to GOD and our ntry, both by the Laws of GOD and the Land, in the behalf of our selves and all good and peaceable People in the Land, and the many thousands  know not their right hand from their left; and in the behalf of the Children unborn, who in time to come may have cause to blesse or curse the day of r birth for your sakes, do make  this humble Addresse to you, as the only means under GOD now left us to redresse these growing mischiefs, which make and the three Nations, in these times of our great trouble, cry unto you (as those of Macedonia did in the Apostles Vision) Come and help us. And,  beseech you, our most grave and worthy Senatours, as you tender the welfare of these bleeding Nations, to stand in the wide gap of our Breaches, with r prayers, improving your Counsels, and every Talent (which God hath reposed in you) for the Honour of GOD, and the Peace of His Church by a  Reformation; and we question not but our most gracious GOD will then break through the thick clouds of these black and dark providences, and re∣ unto us our Judges as at the first, and our Counsellours as at the beginning, with the abundance of the blessings of Peace, that Judgement may run n our streets, and Righteousnesse as a mighty stream. And we humbly desire the two great Pillars of the Land, Magistracy and Ministery, may be rted and encouraged: In order unto which, we humbly present to your grave and serious considerations, st, The Priviledges of the Gospel which we do enjoy at this day in the faithfull preaching and dispensing of GODS holy Word and Sacraments, together  he Labours of so many of His faithfull Servants in the Ministry, and the liberty of these sacred Ordinances, being the best and choicest of our National gs; in respect of which, we may well say (with holy David) God hath not dealt so with any Nation: which with thankfulness we desire to acknow∣  as a great mercy to this Land: And should the LORD remove His Candlestick out of his place (as we have just cause to fear He will, unlesse we do pent Then may we indeed complain with Phineas his wife, The glory is departed from our Israel, and a dark and dismal night of black and gloomy gnorance, Errour and Prophanenesse will invelope our valley of vision. And to the end that this choice Blessing (which we account more precious than ur lives) may be conveyed to Posterity, We most humbly desire the Ministery may be countenanced and encouraged, the Universities upheld and main∣ained, which have nursed many famous Preachers for Piety and Learning in this and former Ages, and your Authority used for the terrour of evil-doers,  ut the praise of them that do well. Secondly, We esteem and assert as our undoubted birth-right, the Freedom and Priviledges of our Parliaments, as being the great Charter of the People f England, which we account equally dear with our Lives, in the enjoyment of which we yet hope under GOD to see a happie and lasting Settlement oth in Church and State: Therefore we most humbly desire that a new Election may be made, or else that those worthy Gentlemen, chosen to serve s Members in the late free Parliament, may be restored to their Priviledges, and sit without disturbance or force from the Army. That they may consider  is evil time, what England, Scotland and Ireland ought to do, which (with submission to your Grave Judgments) we humbly conceive to be the st probable means under GOD to establish the true Protestant Religion, reform the Laws, secure our Liberties, and preserve our Lives and outward ernments, to promote Learning, and encourage Virtue; whereby Peace with our neighbour Nations may be renewed and established, the Army sa∣fed, their Arrears paid, and Trading restored. In all which, most grave and worthy Senatours, your own concernments (aswell as ours) are so deeply ged, that we perswade our selves you will be instrumental to further our Desires, by all peaceable and lawfull means; And we hope it will put an end to  Divisions, which (if GOD in mercy prevent not) may soon break out into another Civil War, and render us as a prey to a forreign enemy: For, a King∣ divided against it self cannot stand. Now we leave it unto you, our most grave and worthy Senatours, duly to consider if you part with these our great National Blessings, whether you will not discover a palpable breach of Trust, and leave your Names for a reproach to the Generations following, who will in the Ages to come rise up and call you blessed, if you be carefull to preserve them now, and convey them to Posterity: And now We beseech the LORD to strengthen both your hearts and hands, and give you wisdom from on high to direct you in all your Consultations, as may be most for the Honour of GOD, the Peace of His Church throughout the World, and the Settlement, Safety and Happinesse of these poor Nations; And by His Assistance we resolve to stand by you, and with you to the utmost hazard of our lives, and all that is dear unto us, to promote the same. Monday, 5. December, 1659. THis day the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council being assembled, the fore-recited PETITION was presented by several Young men and Apprentices, in the behalf of themselves and several thousands which have subscribed the same; the which being received, was ordered to be read, and thereupon a Committee chosen to consider thereof, and to give theirs speedy Report unto the next Court concerning the same. At the same Court it was likewise Ordered, That the Lord General Fleetwood should be desired to draw off the Souldiers unto their several Quarters; it being then also Ordered, That every Common Council man in his several Precinct, should give notice to the House-keepers within the same, that they should keep their Servants and Apprentices at home, thereby to preserve the Peace of the City.
