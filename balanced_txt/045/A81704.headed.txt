A Seasonable Caution, FROM The North to the South▪ BY A Plain Countrey Man, Inhabiting amongst the Northern Hills, from whence the Lord sent forth many of his Servants into the Nation, with the Message of the Gospel, in our Day, whose Going Forth was as the Morning, their Light springing forth as the Day who hath Lived to see the Finishing and Dissolution of many of them, and the Vail of Darkness and Apostacy coming on again, as the Practice and Deport∣ment of many, in divers Publick Meetings in several Parts of this Nation (Who have contended for Form) have sufficiently demonstrated, contrary to the Practice of the True Church in her Purity. The Consideration of which drew him to write these following Lines, though in a plain and simple Stile, being most agreeable to his Capacity, and not in∣consistant with Truth. Desiring the Reader to observe, when he speaks of the Churche's Apostacy; that he means, of that Ruling, or rather Over-Ruling Party, with their Prose∣lites, who call themselves, The Church, that have Judged the Faithful to God, out of Unity, the True Church understanding no cause for such a Censure, except they want submitting Friends Affairs to their written Rules: which I take to be a Mark of Apostacy. Gods Great Appearance broke forth in our Day, Whose Messengers to this Effect did say; A Witness in each Conscience God did place By the Inshinings of his Light and Grace, Did shew to each one, when they went astray Which if obey'd, would lead them in the way Of Life Eternal, which should never dye, In which, all's Happy to Eternity. But if against this Light we did Rebel, Horror of Conscience & the Pangs of Hell Would seize our Souls, and heavy on us lye, And be our torment to Eternity. Thus hath the Lord laid open to each view, And th'Way of Life & Death unto all shew Wherein his Justice greatly doth appear, And when he comes to Judgment, will be clear And each one's Blood required at their own hands, Who having Knowledge, and broke his Commands. But this hath been a Mistery Through Ages, in Apostacy. But th' Night of Darkness nearly spent, His Messengers with's Word he sent,
That God his Will to Man imparts By's Light in secret of their hearts; Touching Gods Worship they inform In Spirit and Truth we must perform; All fain'd, form'd Worship here must fall, Inventions, which some, Worship call. Thus Gospel-Trumpeters he sent Out of the North, which Clouds did rent, And by their Trumpets certain sound, Many awaked which lay bound I'th Grave of Sin, to Glorifie His Omnipotent Majesty: So powerful was this Voice and Call, Terror on Young and Old did fall; And when his Presence did appear, Faces turn'd pale, hearts struck with fear. This dreadful and yet joyful Sound, Did through these British Isles abound: Many to seek God then inclin'd, That knew not th' Light in Darkness shin'd This Pearl lay hid long under ground, Though sought for, yet by few was sound; But in the Lords appointed Time, The Light out of Darkness did shine, And then out of Obscurity Break forth with great Celerity; And when the Darkness thus declin'd, Son 'mongst the Northern hills did shine, And in such splendor to behold, The Fame thereof i'th South was told; Whose Rising was to Admiration, Which was confirmed through this Nation, From which Illuminating Rays, Both North & South his Name may praise. Then Reformation did begin, And th' New Creation known within, Then of New Heavens & Earth could tell Where Truth and Righteousness do dwell: The Deserts then came for to yield More Plenty than the Fruitful Field. God in his Servants by his Word, Wrought this effect, which thus occur'd; Being with Righteous Armour clad, And Gospel-Preparation shod, Whose Vessels he did Sanctifie, That they his Name might Glorifie; He choosed the plainer sort of Men, Which he prepar'd for's Preachers then, Who were not Learn'd Rabinical, Yet taught of him who did them call: Some Call▪d from Wife, and Children small, Who in Obedience gave up all; And in the Faith and Power they went To unknown Place and Faces sent, And th' Saving-Gospel to them Preach't, Which in his Name & Power they Teach't, And through it many a Conscience Reacht. Others he Rais'd in younger Years, Who Faithful Witnesses appears, And from their Fathers House did take, And Skilful Preachers likewise make, For to divide the Word aright, Who in his Counsel walkt Ʋpright: Both Young & Old who kept their Station, Prophets and Preachers to their Nation: And what I here do testifie, Both North and South may verifie. Their Godly Labours he did bless, Ʋnto the Churches great Success; Who then came Flocking in apace, Turn'd Inward to Gods Light and Grace; To which his Servants did direst, Knowing 'twould Righteousness effect; In less than half an Age of Time Thousands did flock to Gods Ensign Of Light, his Ministers held out, Which People gather'd then about: And in short time our Eyes did see Church-Gather'd numerous to be; And in more Beauty now appears Than She had done hundreds of Years; Her Lights did shine, their Lamps did burn Which shew'd her Wilderness Return: So obvious in the World was She,
Described then by Innocence, Adorn'd with Vertuous Ornaments, Perfum'd with Odoriferous Scents, That 'twere great Pity that e're She Again to th' Wilderness should flee. 'Twould many a Spirit wound and goar, Considering this Estate before, In this same Age and Time to see, Entring again Apostacy; And when that we do call to mind How Good the Lord hath been, and Kind, And that in Her Reveal'd hath been What Good Men wisht, and have not seen: It rests upon them as a Seal, That's true to Israel's Commonweale; Remembring those joyful Days, Resembling Years of Jubilees: When She did keep a Holy Day, Like as the Sacred Writ doth say, Then from her Labours She doth cease, Resting in Him who gave her Peace: How unto Her did People hye, As Doves into the Window fly, Most amiable to behold Flocks Gathered, Resting in the Fold, Sweetly in Him taking Repose In Innocence, fearing no Foes, Nor in the Fold was pushing any, Though into it were gathered many, Which then came flocking far and nigh, To hear her Wisdom from on high: No jarring then there did appear, Th' Great Shepherd of the Flock was there: Each one in Peace possest his Vine, Her Ministers amidst her shine, Which did the Heavenly Image shew Most pleasant in the Church to view: Many strong Pillars in her stand, Supported by th' Almighties Hand. Then in those glorious Gospel-Rays Was seen on's Throne th' Antient of Days, And great and little Stars appear, Shining in order in their Sphere:
Then in the Church Sincerity, Was priz'd above Formality; And Praise ascends as with one Voice, Together th' Morning Stars rejoyce, And then in her the Light did shine. Opening deep Misteries Divine; Such sacred things reveal'd hath been, As Vultrous Eye hath never seen, When I look back for to aspect, These Days, my Soul, greatly affect, My Spirit, they almost inspire, And on my Altar kindle Fire, Who knew these things, and yet forget, May for the Kingdom prove unfit. Then th' Church of Glory wore a Crown, But now, alas! her Sun goes down; She in great Splendor then did shine, But now her Beauty doth decline; Once cloath'd with comly Ornaments, Dis-robing now sends forth ill Scents; Some that in her as Light shin'd clear, Now growing dim, like Clouds appear: But wo unto that Man or Place, That brought upon Christs Church, Disgrace Better 'tad been, if they, or he Had sunk i'th bottom of the Sea. How happy had She been this day, If She had kept i'th Antient Way, Th' Nation for her sake been blest, And She her Peace in God possest; Then had she still wore Glories Crown, Her Sun had not been going down. This former Glory is past and gone, And Tyranny i'th Chuch comes on, When Antient Pastors mostly sleep, Who into th' Fold gathered the Sheep; Whose sense of loss of them is deep, Which cause their Flocks in secret weep, When Conscience must to Slavery Mens Rules Imposed to walk by: This Faith and Conscience doth invade, Which Truth and Reason should perswade;
When we the Gospel did receive, Our Conscience witness to it gave: Is't Gods, or Mens Way that's chang'd now, That of this Test she'l not allow; The Truth, it will the Test indure, And th' more it's try'd, appeareth pure; But I do take it for their Pride, Who on ambitious Wings do ride, Who would have Faith pin'd on their Sleeves, That say, Believe, as th' Church Believes. Yet if they'l right Distinctions make, Wee'l grant it, and for Truth it take; But if She'l make Laws, and compel, And out of her all such expel, And cast out of her Ʋnity Who with her Rules can't comply, As such, in Her we cannot believe, Nor pin our Faith upon Her Sleeve. But in this Practice Sbe hath been, Our Ears have heard, and Eyes have seen: Therefore let none offended be, We say, This is Apostacy. Will she prescribe a Form wherein he must remain, That th' Heaven of Heavens of old could not con∣tain? No such Commission yet we have, Obeying Her, New Laws can save. And since these things i'th Church took place Dayly on her hath come disgrace; And greatly there is cause to fear The Wolves again the Flock may tear. Her late Procedur's not the way That the Flocks into the Fold did draw, Nor like his Voice, nor like his Call, Who is great Shepherd over all. Th' Pretended Church usurping Power, Gives Satan advantage to devour: Drawing from the Life of Restoration, To practice Excommunication Of those who do true witness bear Ʋnto the Truth of God in Fear; This is not the Spirit which is free, Ordain'd for Captives Liberty;
Who have Gods Messengers Rejected, They and their Message disrespected, And sowing of Divisions Seed, Have made the Churches sorely bleed; 'Tis they that brought her to this State, That Brethren Excommunicate: By Innocence how is she known, Whose Practice hath such Rigor shown, And yet can give no reason why, But Her Prescriptions not walkt by; And this hath caus'd Her thus to Rage, Like as some did in former Age: Mother Ignorance, though old, I fear May yet Conceive, and Children Bear: But yet I hope there thousands be, That serve God in Sincerity, What e're Assemblies may decree, Can to Inventions how no Knee, Whose Faith and Hope in God doth stand, Fears not Excommunications Brand: But looking back, still think upon The Glory of those Days are gone, Compared with these present Times, Might cause my Pen write pensive Lines, When those who had th' Gospel to preach, Have not been suffered it to teach. This often soundeth in my ear, That Famine of the Word draws near, The greatest Judgment that can fall Ʋpon a Poople, Great or Small. Then such too late may call to mind, How to Gods Servants they were unkind; And since to them they lend no ear, They from the Lord no word may hear, And this there is more cause to fear Than the sharp smiting Sword or Spear. And for to see the Churches Rent, In gathering which many were spent. This is none of the meanest Crimes, As may be known in future Times, And Children unborn may weep, When the Gospel Planters fall asleep;
If in this Land Christ be not found, Nor to be heard the Gospel Sound, Then doubtless woful Days come on, When once the Gospel Sound is gone, People may wander far and nigh, And Springs, Fountains, shall be dry, Then withered shall be their Goard, When ther's a Famine of the Word: But God deliver us, I pray, We never see this woful Day: A wounded Spirit would us grieve, When there is no one to Believe. Sad Symptoms of these things appear, This Judgment may be drawing near; When as the Church so busie be, To Compel to Conformity: When written Rules must be our Guide, Which th' Spirits Leadance lays aside: And when Church Orders must take place, Above the Inward Truth and Grace: Else to what end do they decree To sentence out of Ʋnity, Only for Non-conformity: Forcing to Practice (is blind Zeal) That which the Lord doth not Reveal: Her Practice shews if she had Power, She'd force her Cup like to the Whore: Then from the greatest to the Least, None buys nor sells, but th' Mark o'th Beast Yet's hop'd there's many would not sup Of the Abomination Cup; But such Procedure may procure True Church for to remain obscure: The Whore would then great painting make, And for the Spouse her self will take, And many by her be misled, True Church to th' Wilderness being fled: These things these Times too much concern, Although some may against it spurn, Yet I their Censures do not fear, Nor frowning Countenance austere: All Judgment to the Son commit, Who Judge of Quick and Dead shall sit. Further 'tis in my Mind to say, And witness bear to the antient way, The Light of th' Sun which God had sent, Did and doth Summon to Repent; No other way he hath made known, Which leadeth to Salvation, Subjection to this Light within, True Reformation doth begin; It calletb for Sincerity, And to walk in Integrity, To serve God with an Ʋpright Heart, And from each evil way depart; This is that Antient Way and Path, Through Ages walkt the Righteous hath; And yet the New and Living Way God hath revealed in our Day; No Devil into this Transform, Though call i'th Church for Ʋniform, Into Impos'd Formality May enter greatest Hypocrisy, And into Ceremonial Rites May enter greatest Hypocrites; But into th' Light and Grace within, Hypocrisy ne're enters in: No Outward Forms preserib'd can save, Nor Ransome any from the Grave; Therefore there ought great care to be, To what is prest-Conformity: Conformity avails no whit, But to the Mind of Christ submit: Grant this, why is their laid such stress On Outward Rules, Conscience to press▪ If not obey'd, then out they cry, Th' Church with you hath no Unity. It is a weakly Ʋnity That consists in Conformity, Stronger's the Bond, Surer's, the Tye, Where Truth is Cords of Ʋnity; Gathered Assemblies understand Conscience's not bound to your Command, Neither to you doth appertain To Compel Conscience, or Restrain
In point of Worship it is not fit Mens Rules decreed should govern it; It appertains to God on high, Who Rules on Earth and above the Sky. Conscience it is a Receptacle What God to Man doth preach, And in Man, that's his Tabernacle, Who his Statutes doth teach. Therefore who doth this Place assume, They are Ʋsurpers and presume His Throne for to ascend, And greatly God offend, Who through his Spirit of Truth & Grace, For himself sanctifies this Place. This I would add e're I give o're, Not knowing where I may write more; For Time seems short alotted here, When we be gone, and disappear; Gods Servants do haste off the Stage, The Lord seems to cut short this Age; Though he by them great things hath done, Their Time was swift, as Posts that run, Whose Course seem'd Run before ripe Age, Which something may to us presage, Though as a Secret it be seal'd From all but to whom God Reveal't: Many who have the Vineyard drest, Now in the Fathers bosome rest: And from their Labours now do cease, In full Enjoyment of Heavens Peace; And lasting Joys, which never fail, Whil'st we their Absence here bewail: But their blest Memory makes us glad, Mixing our Joys with Sorrows sad. And that which further satisfie, Death could not break our Ʋnity. And when our Pilgrimage is at an end, Hope to partake with them, Joys that tran∣scend: And in the interim do cast in this Mite, Them to make known to future age delight. Heavenly was their Society, Great Patterns of Piety, Meeting together to converse, Would many heavenly things rehearse, Making deep Misteries appear Ʋnto our Ʋnderstandings clear, Opening to us the Heavenly way, Clear as the Light is at Noon Day. Twas no small Mercy, may we say, That we were brought forth in their Day, Nor the least Mercy that we see, A Remnant of this Stock yet be, Who th' Gospel Truth do still aver, And from the Antient Path not err: In contemplation of this deep, Both Heart rejoyce, and Eyes do weep; And Matter still it doth indite, 'Twere endless for my Pen to write, For that a Depth there doth remain, Which Tongue nor Pen can ne're explain: And yet I faint to think upon Th' danger of th' Flock when they are gone; Though God is able to supply, If they alone in Caves should lye, Then on his Graces sufficience: Let's all have our Dependence. Here I shall rest and make an end, And all unto this Grace commend; Councel that's antient and profound, And through this Nation once did sound. Being inclin'd thus to rehearse These solid Truths in simple Verse, Needing no flourishing Elegance, The Subject of it self's, Substance. Wrote in the 10th. Month, 1682. G. D.
