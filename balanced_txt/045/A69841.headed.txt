A Curious COLLECTION OF Musick-Books, Both VOCAL and INSTRVMENTAL, (and several Rare COPIES in Three and Four Parts, Fairly Prick'd) by the Best MASTERS. Formerly designed to have been sold by way of Auction: But the Reason of its being put off, was, That several Gentlemen, Lovers of Musick, living remote from London, having a De∣sire for some of this Collection, and could not be there, they are here set down in Order, with the Rates, being lower than could be afforded otherwise. The Collection is to be sold by Henry Playford, at his House at the Lower End of Arundel-Street in the Strand; where the Collection may be viewed four Days after the Publication in the Gazette. All Gentlemen and Ladies that Desire any of these Collections, sending in time the Number and the Price, may have them de∣livered, they being designed to be sold off in a Fortnight. Catalogues may be had Gratis, of Mr. Knight Bookseller in the New-Ex∣change in the Strand; Mr. Carr at his Shop at the Middle Temple-Gate in Fleetstreet; Mr. Salter Instrument-Seller on the North-side of St. Paul's Church; Mr. Hindmarsh Bookseller against the Royal Exchange in Cornhil; at Mr. Henry Playford's Shop near the Temple-Church; and of Mr. Dolliff Bookbinder in Oxford.
