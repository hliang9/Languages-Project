Si Signior, I know not What countryman invented, but they say There be Chopinoes made with such rare art, That worne by a Lady when she meanes to dance, Shall with their very motion sound forth musicke, And by a secret sympathy with their tread Strike any tune that without other instrument, Their feete both dance and play.

Bo. Will the Lords suffer him. Co. Or lose their mirth, hee's knowne in every science, And can abuse em all, some ha suppos'd He has a worme ins braine, which at some time Oth' Moone doth ravish him into perfect madnesse, And then he prophesies, and will depose The Empeorr, and set up Bethalem Gabre. Bo. Hee's dead, I hope he wonot conjure for him. Co.

May expect too long, Farewell Coronell. Exeunt. Enter Lady Rosomond, and Lady Honoria. Ros. Why doe you so commend him? Hon. Does he not Deserve it? name a gentleman in the Kingdome, So affable, so moving in his language, So pleasant, witty, indeede every thing A Lady can desire. Ros. Sure thou dost love him, Ile tell his Lordshippe when I see him agen, How zealous you are in his commendation. Hon. If I be not mistaken, I have heard Your tongue reach higher in his praises Madam, How ere you now seeme cold, but if you tell him My opinion, as you shall doe him no pleasure, You can doe me no injury, I know His Lordship has the constitution Of other Courtiers, they can endure To be commended. Ros. But I prethee tell me, Is not love whence this proceeds, I have I must confesse discourst of his good parts, Desir'd his company. Ho. And had it? Ros. Yes, and had it. Ho. All night. Ros. You are not I hope jealous, If I should say all night I neede not blush, It was but at a Ball, but what of this? Ho. Ene what you will Ros. I hope you ha no patent To dance alone with him, if he ha priviledge To kisse another Lady, she may say He does salute her, and returne a cursie To shew her breeding, but Ile now be playner, Although you love this Lord, it may possible He may dispose his thoughts another wayâ–ª Ho. He may so.
Ros. Who can helpe it, he has eyes To looke on more than one, and understand Perhaps to guide, and place his love upon The most deserving object. Ho. Most deserving, This language is not levill with that friendship, You have profest, this touches a comparison. Ros. Why doe you thinke all excellence is throng'd Within your beauty. Ho. You are angry Lady, How much does this concerne you to be thus Officious in his cause, if you be not Engag'd by more than ordinary affection. I must interpret this no kinde respect To me. Ros. Angry, ha, ha. Ho. You then transgresse against civilitie. Ros. Good Madam why? because, I thinke, and tell you that another Lady May be as hansome in some mans opinion, Admit I lov'd him too, may not I hold Proportion with you, on some entreaty. Enter Lord. Lor. They're loude, Ile not be seene yet. Ros. What is it that exalts you above all Comparison? my father was as good A gentleman, and my mother has as great A spirit. Ho. Then you love him too. Ros. Twill appeare No greater miracle in me I take it, Yet difference will be, perhaps I may Affect him with a better consequence. Ho. Your consequence perhaps may be denied too, Why there are no such wonders in your eye Which other composition doe not boast of, My Lord no doubt hath in his travells clapt As modest cheekes, and kist as melting lippes.
Ro. And yet mine are not pale. Ho. It may be they blush for the teeth behinde them. Ro. I have read No sonnets on the sweetnesse of your breath. Ho. Tis not perfum'd. Ro. But I have heard of your tongue exalted much, Highly commended. Ho. Not above your forehead, When you have brush'd away the hairie pentehrush, And made it visible. Lo. Ile now interrupt 'em. Theyle fall by the eares else presently. Ho. My Lord. Lo. What in contention Ladies? Ro. Oh my Lord you'r welcome. Lo. Expresse it in discoverie of that Made you so earnest, I am confident You were not practising a Dialogue To entertaine me. Ho. Yet it did concerne you. Ro. Do not you blush, fie Madam. Lo. Nay and you come to blush once, and fie Madam, Ile know the secret, by this kisse I will, And this. Ho. You were kis'd first, discover now At your discretion. Ro. My Lord we were in jest. Ho. It might ha turn'd to earnest, if your Lordship Had not interpos'd. Lo. Come out with it. Ro. We had a difference. Lo Well said. Ro. About a man ith' world, you are best name him. Ho. You have the better gift at telling secrets. Lo. Yet agen, come Ile helpe it out, there is A gentleman ith' world, some call a Lord. Ro. Did your Lordship over-heare us? Lo. Nay nay, you must stand too't,
One, whom you Love, it will appeare no greater miracle In you I take it, one no doubt that hath Travel'd, and clapt as modest cheekes, and kis'd As melting lippes, thus farre ime right, but what Name this most happy man doth answer too, Is not within my circle. Ho. Yet you know him. Ro. Not to retaine your Lordship ith' darke, Confident you'le not accuse my modesty For giving you a truth, you shall not travell Beyond your selfe to find his name, but doe not Triumph my Lord. Lo. Am I so fortunate, Then love I doe forgive thee, and will cherish The flame I did suspect would ruine me, You two divide my love, onely you twoâ–ª Be gentle in your Empire heavenly Ladies, No enemy abroad can threaten you, Be carefull then, that you maintaine at home No civill warres. Ho. How dee meane my Lord? Lo. You are pleas'd to smile upon me gentle Lady, And I have tooke it in my heart more than Imaginary blessings with what pleasure Could I behold this beautie, and consume My understanding to know nothing else, My memory to preserve no other figure. Ro. My Lord, I am not worth your flatterie. Lo. I flatter you? Venus her selfe be judge, To whom you are so like in all thats faire, Twere sinne but to be modest. Ro. How my Lord? Lo. Do not mistake me, twere A sinne but to be modest in your praises, Heres a hand, nature shew me such another, A brow, a cheeke, a lip, and every thing, Happy am I that Cupids blinde.
Ro. Why happy? Lo. If he could see, he would forsake his Mistresse To be my rivall, and for thy embraces Be banish'd heaven. Ho. My Lord Ile take my leave. Lo. If you did know how great a part of me, Will whither in your absence, you would have More charitie, one accent of unkinde Language from you, doth wound me more than all The mallice of my destinies, oh deare Madam, You say you'le take your leave of your poore servantâ–ª Say rather, you will dwell for ever here, And let me stay and gaze upon Your heavenly forme. Ho. I can be patient To heare your Lordship mocke me, these are but A course reward for my good thoughts. Lo. This tis to use plaine dealing, and betray the inside Of our hearts to women, did you thinke well of me So late, and am I forfeited already, Am I a Christian? Ho. Yes I hope my Lord. Lo. Make me not miserable then, deare Madam, With your suspition, I dissemble with you, But you know too well what command your beauty Has upon me. Ho. Give me leave My Lord to wonder you can love me, With such a flame you have exprest yet shee, Your mistresse? Lo. You are both my Mistresses. Ro. I like not this so well. Lo. There is no way but one to make me happy. Ho. I wish my Lord I had the art to effect What you desire. Ro. Or I. Lo. It is within Your powers.
Ho. Speake it my Lord. Lo. Since it is so That Ime not able to determine which My heart, so equall unto both, would chuse, My suite is to your vertues, to agree Betweene your selves, whose creature I shall beâ–ª You can judge better of your worths than I, My allegiance shall be ready if you can Conclude which shall ha the supremacie; Take pitty on your servant gentle Ladies, And reconcile a heart too much divided, So with the promise of my obedience To her that shall be fairest, wisest, sweetest Of you two, when I next present a lover, I take distracted leave. Exit. Ho. Why, this is worse than all the rest. Ro. Hee's gone, And has referr'd himselfe to us. Ho. This will Aske counsell. Ro. And some time I would be loth To yeeld. Ho. And I, Cupid instruct us both. Exeunt. Actus Secundus. Enter Barker, Freshwater, and Gudgine. Bar. ANd what made you to undertake this voyageâ–ª Sweete Signior Freshwater. Fr.

Bo. No body heares, why harke you Lady, could You love me, if I were lesse honourable? Luc. Honourable? why you cannot be so base As I would have you, that the world might say My marriage gave you somewhat. Bo. Say you so, Vnder the Rose, if that will doe you a pleasure, The Lords doe call me cosin, but I am. Luc. What? Bo. Suspected. Luc. How? Bo.

He loves you both, he told me so, And laughs behind a vilard at your frailtie, He cannot love that way you imagine, And Ladies of the game are now no miracles. Hon. Although he use to raile thus, yet we have Some argument to suspect his Lordships tongue Has beene to liberall. Ros. I finde it too, and blush within to thinke How much we are deceived, I may be even With this May-Lord. Exit. Hon. But does his Lordship thinke We were so taken with his person. Bar.

That I might examine, And doe my judgement right betweene you two nowâ–ª How much he would come short, you have an eye Worth fortie of his, nose of another making; I saw your teeth ene now compar'd to which, His are of the complexion of his combe, I meane his boxe, and will in time be yellower, And aske more making cleane, you have a shew Of something on your upper lippe, a Witch Has a Philosophers beard to him, his chinne Has just as many hounds as haires that ever My eyes distinguish'd yet, you have a body And unpromising in his slashes, one May see through him, and for his legges they both Would but make stuffing for one hansome stocking, Th'are a Lords I will be sworne, I dote upon him, I could wish somewhat, but I me sworry sir To trouble you so much, all happie thoughts Possesse you.

Ma. Howes this? Co. Oh impudence unheard, pardon Madam My tedious silence, the affront grew up So fast I durst not trust my understanding That any gentleman could attempt so much Dishonour to a Lady of your goodnesse; Was this your project to make me appeare Guilty of that I hate beyond all sacriledge, Was it for this you pray'd my company, You todpoles? tis your presence charmes my sword, Or they shall quickly pay their forfeit lives, No Altar could protect 'em.

Could your corrupted natures finde no way But this to recompence her noble favours, Her courteous entertainements, would any Heathens done like to you? admit she was So just to say she could see nothing in you Worthy her deerer thoughts as to say truth,
How could a creature of her wit and judgement Not see how poore and miserable things You are at best? must you impudent In such a loud, and peremptory manner, Disturbe the quiet of her thoughts and dwelling Gentlemen rather hinds scarce fit to mixe, Vnlesse you mend her manners with her drudges.

To call you Mistresse, till the happier title Of wife crowne his desires. Luc. I must confesse, This has wone much upon me: but two words To such a bargaine, y'are a gentleman, Ime confident would adventure for me. Co. As farre as a poore life could speake my service. Luc. Thats faire and farre enough, I make not any Exception to your person. Co. Body enough I hope to please a Lady
Luc. But. Co. To my fortune. Luc. To that the least, I have estate for both. Co. Though if hold no comparison with youre, It keepes me like a gentleman. Luc. I have a scruple. Co.

What is your meaning Lady? Luc. I doe not urge you for the time to come. Pray understand, have you beene honest hitherto And yet because you shannot trouble friends To be compurgators, Ile be satisfied; If you will take your owne oath that you are. Co. Honest of my body? Luc. Yes sir, it will become me to be carefull Of my health, Ile take your owne assurance, If you can cleare your body by an oath, Ile marry none but you, before this gentlewoman. Co.

Bo. He did so tis a truth. Lo. And did you take it? Bo. Take it: he gave it me my Lord, I asked not for it. But tis not yet reveng'd. Am. Tis truth we suffer'd A little, but the place protected him. Bo. It was no place indeed. Ma. Now since you had the greatest burden in The affront. Bo. The blow? Ma. Right, wo wod know whether your resolution Be first, to question him, for our cause appeares Subordinate, and may take breath till you Ha call'd him to account. Bo. I proclaime nothing, And make no doubt the Coronell will give me Satisfaction like a Gentleman. Am. We are answer'd, and take our leave my Lord. Lo. We shall meete at the Ball anon gentlemen. Ma.

I my good Lord? Lo. Thou most unheard of coward, How dare you bost relation to me? Be so impudent as to name, or thinke upon me, Thou staine to honour, honour? th'art beneath All the degrees of basenesse: quit thy father, Thy suppos'd one, and with sufficient testimony, Some Servingman leapt thy mother, or some Iuggler That conjures with old bones, some womans tailor, When he brought home her petticoate, and tooke measure Of her lose body, or Ile cullice thee With a bottome. Bo. Good my Lord. Lo. Be so baffoul'd?
In presence of your Mistresse, tis enough To make the blood of all thou knowest suspected, And Ile ha satisfaction. Bo. My Lord. Lo. For using of my name in Ordinaries, Ith' list of other whom you make your priviledge, To dominere, and winne applause sometimes With Tapsters, and thread-beare Tobacco Merchants, That worship your gold lace, and ignorance Stand bare, and bend their hammes, when you belch out My Lord, and tother cosin in a Baudihouse, Whom with a noyse you curse by Iacke and Tom, For failing you at Fishstreete, or the Still-yard. Bo. My very good Lord. Lo. Will you not draw? Bo. Not against your honour, but you shall see. Lo. And vexe my eyes to looke on such a Land-rat, Were all these shames forgotten, how shall I Be safe in honour with that noble Lady, To whom I sinne fully commended thee, Though twere not much, enough to make her thinke I am as base as thou art, and the Coronell, And all that have but heard thee call me cosin, What cure for this you Malt-worme? oh my soule How it does blush to know thee, bragging puppie, Dee heare me thunder, and lightning, what Nobilitie my predecessors bosted, Or any man from honours stocke descended; How many Marquesses and Earles are numbred In their great family? what coates they quarter, How many battells our forefathers fought? Tis poore, and not becomming perfect gentry To build their glories at their fathers cost, But at their owne expense of blood or vertue, To raise them living monuments, our birth Is not our owne act, honour upon trust, Our ill deedes forfeit, and the wealthy summes Purchas'st by others fame or sweate, will be
Our staine, for we inherit nothing truely But what our actions make us worthy of; And are you not a precious gentleman, Thou art not worth my steele, redeeme this love Some generous way of undertaking, or Thou shalt be given up to boyes, and ballets, The scorne of footeman, a disgrace more blacke Than bastard, goe to the Coronell. Bo. I will my Lord. Lo. But now I thinke ont twill be necessarie, That first you right my honour with the Lady, You shall carry a letter, you will do't? Bo. Ile carry any thing. Lo. Expect it presently. Exit Bo. Such another conjuring will make me Beleeve I am illigitimate indeede, This came first keeping company with the blades, From whom I learnt to roare and runne away: I know tis a base thing to be a coward, But every man is not borne to be a Hercules, Some must be beate that others may be valiant. Exit. Enter Rosomond, and Honoria whispering, Sr. Marmaduke, and Sr. Ambrose following. Ro. Let it be so, they will else be troublesome. Ma. This cannot I hope displease you Lady, tis No new affection I protest, although This be the first occasion I tooke To expresse it. Ro. You did ill in the impression, Although your bashfulnesse would not permit you To speake in your owne cause, you might have sent Your meaning, I can make a shift to read A scurvie hand, but I shall tell you sir. Ma. Prethee doe. Ho. Ist possible your heart hath beene tormented In loves flame, and I the cause. Am. Your beauty hath the power To melt a Cithians bosome, those divine
Beames would make soft the earth, when rugged Winter Hath seal'd the cranies up with frost, your eye Will make the frigid region temperate, Should you but smile upon't: account it then No wonder if it turne my brest to ashes. Ro. I see you are in love by your mention, And cause I pitty a gentleman should lose His passion Ile acquaint you with a secret. Ma. The Lady Honoria? Ro. What misfortune twas You did not first apply your selfe to her That can reward your love, and hath a heart Spacious to entertaine you; she does love you Vpon my knowledge strangely, and so Commends you in your absence. Ma. Say you so Lady? Pardon I beseech you the affection I profest to your Ladiship, twas but A complement, I am sorry I protest. Ro. Oh tis excus'd sir, but I must tell you, Perhaps you wonot finde her now so tractable Vpon the apprehension she was slighted; But to prescribe you confidence were to Suspect your art, and bold discretion. Ho. Tis as I tell you sir, no Lady in The world can speake more praises of your body? Shee knowes not yet your minde. Am. Ist possible? Ho. And yet because she saw your complements Directed so unhappily to me, I know not how youle finde her on the sudden, But tis not halfe an houre since you possest The first place in her thoughts. Am. Shall I presume, You will excuse the love I did present Your Ladiship? it was not from my heart, I hope you will conceive so. Ho. A slight error.
Am. I am a sham'd on't. Ho. Tis sufficient That you recant no more neglect. Ro. You are pleasant. Am. Be you so too; Ile justifie thou shalt Have cause. Ro. To wonder at you, whats your meaning sir? Am. Sweete Lady, What thoughts make sad your brow? I have observ'd Your eyes shoote clearer light. Ro. You are deceiv'd, I am not melancholy. Am. Be for ever banish'd The imagination of what can happen To cloud so rare a beautie, y'are in love. Ro. In love, who told you so? Am. But thats no wonder, We all may love, but you have onely power To conquer where you place affection, and triumph ore your wishes. Ho. I love you, y'are strangely sir mistaken, Put your devices on some other Lady, I ha beene so farre from my affection to you, That I ha laboured I confesse to unsettle The opinion of my Lady Rosomond, Who I confesse loves you, and that extreamely. Mar. How? she love me? then I ha made fine worke. Ho. What cunning shee is mistresse of to hide Her strange affections, or what power she has, She does flie into your armes I know not. Ro. Are you so dull? Why, this was but to try your constancie, I have heard her sweare you are the proprest Knight, The very Adonis: why, she has got your picture And made it the onely saint within her closet, I blush at your credulitie. Am. Ist e'ne so? I have undone my selfe with her already, Pardon me gentle Madam, I must leave you.

Strange? Bo. D'ee not conceive it? so many drops of mine, So many gentlemen, nay more, who knowes Which of these might ha beene a Knight, a Lord. Luc. Perhaps a Prince. Bo. Princes came from the blood, And should I hazard such a severation Against a single life, tis not I feare To fight with him by these hills, but what wise gamester Will venture a hundred pound to a flaw'd sixe pence?

To marry you, which act must make you Lord Of me and my estate, a round possession, Some men have gone to hell for a lesse matter. Co. But I wonot be damn'd for twenty thousand
Such as you are, and every one a million, And I the authoritie of a Parliament To marry wo'yee all, I wod not buy This flesh now I ha sworne. Luc. I thinke so Coronell, Blesse me? twenty thousand wives, two'd nere Come to my turne, and you'd not live to give The tithe benevolence. Co. They would finde Pages, fooles, or Gentlemen-Vshens. Luc. Then upon the matter, You being not willing sir to take your oath, I may be confident you are not honest. Co. Why looke upon me Lady, and consider With some discretion what part about me Does looke so tame you should suspect me honest, How old dee thinke I am? Luc. I guesse at thirty. Co. Some ith' world doubted me not so much, At thirteene I was ever plumpe and forward, My drie Nurse swore at seven, I kist like one Of five and twenty, setting that a side, Whats my profession? Luc. A Souldier Co. So examine a whole army, and finde one Souldier that hates a hansome woman, we cannot march Without our bagge and baggages, and is it possible, When we come home where womens pride, and all Temptation to wantonesse abounds We should lose our activitie? Lu. You souldiers are brave fellowes. Co. When we have our pay, We vow no chastitie till we marry, Lady Tis out of fashion indeede with gentlemen To be honest, and of age together tis sufficient, We can provide to take our pleasures too, Without infection, a sound body is A treasure I can tell you, yet if that Would satisfy you, I should make no scruple To sweare, but otherwise you must pardon us As we must pardon you. Luc. Vs sir. Co. Yes you, as if you Ladies had not your fagaries,

But if men had no more wit, and honesty, They wod let fall their stings on something else, This is discours'd, but when Corantaes faile, Or newes at ordinaries, when the phlegmaticke Dutch Ha tane no Fisher-boates, or our Cole-ships land Safe at New-Castle, y'are fine gentlemen, But to conclude of that we met for your honesty, Not justified by an oath, as I expected, Is now suspended, will you sweare yet. Co. Why, I thought you had beene a Christian? widdow Have I not told you enough, you may meete one Will forfeit his conscience, and please you better, Some Silke-worme oth' Cittie, or the Court, There be enough will sweare away their soule For your estate, but I have no such purpose, The warres will last I hope.

He could secure my opinion by his oath, That he was honest, I am bound in honour Not to goe backe, y ave done it, I am yours sir, Be you a witnesse to this solemne contract. Co. Are you in earnest Lady, I ha not sworne. Luc. You have given better truth, He that can make this conscience of an oath Assures his honesty.
Co. In minde. Luc. Whats past I question not, if for the time to come Your love be vertuous to me. Co. Most religious, Or let me live the Souldiers dishonour, And die the scorne of gentlemen, I ha not Space enough in my heart to entertaine thee. Luc. Is not this better than swearing? Co. I confesse it. Luc. Now I may call you husband? Co. No title can more honour me. Luc. If please you Ile shew you then my children. Co. How, your children? Luc. I ha sixe that call me mother. Co. Hast, faith? Luc. The elder may want softnesse to acknowledge you, But some are young enough, and may be counsell'd To aske your blessing, does this trouble you? Co. Trouble me? no, but it is the first newes Lady Of any children. Luc. Nay, they are not like To be a burden to us, they must trust To their owne portions left 'em by their father. Co. Where. Luc. But of my estate, I cannot keepeâ–ª Any thing from 'em, and I know you are So honest, you'd not wish me wrong the Orphans, Tis but sixe thousand pound in money Coronell Among them all, beside some trifling plate And jewels worth a thousand more. Co. No more? Luc. My Ioynture will be firme to us, two hundred Per annum. Co.
