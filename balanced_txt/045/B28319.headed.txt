THE PRESENT CASE OF Our English Wool, And the MANUFACTURE of it, Humbly offered to the Consideration of the PARLIAMENT. THat our English Wool, and the Manufacture of it, for these many Ages past, hath not only been the Wealth and Publick Stock of our Kingdom, but the chief and principal Support and Maintenance of our Trade and Commerce with all our neighbouring Kingdoms and States, we need not here make it any part of this to prove; the present decay thereof, both in the low price of our Wool at home, and in the sinking of our English Cloath-trade abroad, give us sufficient experience of this truth. What Care and Industry hath been used by our Kings and Parliaments in former Ages, to preserve and encourage this Woollen Manufacture of our own growth, and to engross it wholly within the bounds of our own Nation, for the employing of our Poor, and for the furnishing us with such a Staple-Commodity which should enable us by the return thereof to bear up a Trade with other parts of the world for their Commodities which we wanted, without exhausting our Money, the several Acts and Statutes of Parliament made in the Reigns of King Edward the Third, Richard the Second, Edward the Sixth, Queen Elizabeth, and King James, may sufficiently inform us: And no question, had not the late unhappy and destructive VVar (the onely Cause of this and all other Miseries the Nation at this day can complain of) broken out upon us, there would doubtless have been the same (if not greater) care taken for the Preservation of this Trade, in all our later Parliaments; and not have suffered it thus mi∣serably to be abused both in the Making and Selling of our Cloath. The engrossing whereof into the hands of a few private persons (called Factors) set up in the late Rebellion at Blackwell-hall, adds much to the hindring and decaying of this our Trade, by the want of that Freedom our Clothiers in all former times ever had to Dispose and Sell their own Cloath themselves. The Complaints of those, with what may be the Causes of the low price of our VVool, the which is more largely discours'd in some few sheets, called A Treatise of Wool and Cattel, is humbly offered to the Judgment and Consideration of this present Parliament, the onely High Court before whom this Case can come for Redress. There can be no greater or more prevailing Argument used to beg your Care of this great Business, than to minde you of the industry and diligence of your Predecessors in all former Parliaments ever since the Manufacture became our own, to preserve it to our selves; and of what an unvaluable Con∣cern they ever lookt upon it to be to the Interest and Trade of this Kingdom, that the endeavouring the Abuse of it in some Cases hath been made Felony. But if to encourage your zeal herein, we should offer to your Consideration, how much your private, and every Members particular Concern is linkt even to this very Trade, and that the low price of our Wool (as at this day) makes your Rents come in so slow, and some perhaps not at all, and brings all the Lands and Estates of the Kingdom concern'd therein, to a far less Value now than they were at when this Trade had an encouragement, and was in Reputation in the world. VVe cannot but hope we shall yet, by your great VVisdom and Prudence, live to see the same restored to its ancient Credit and Esteem again; and to have your chief and principal Care for its Increase and Advancement, as well by removing all Causes of its decay on the one hand, and by promoting the general Use and VVearing of our own Cloath, and spending of our VVool among our selves, on the other; as by improving those present opportunities we have at this day with our Neighbours (more than possibly we may meet with at another time if this be omitted) to advance this VVoollen-trade, by procuring that part of the Manufacture thereof now abroad, to return to its natural Soil, where for these many Ages past it hath onely flourish'd, and hath been the great business and employment for our People, the Staple-Commodity of our Nation, and the chief and principal Support of our Trade. The Reasons of the Low price of our VVool, and Decay of this Trade, will be humbly offered to that Committee your VVisdoms shall appoint to examine it.
