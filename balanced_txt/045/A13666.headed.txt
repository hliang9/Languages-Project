A SHORT Inuentory of cer∣tayne Idle Inuentions ❧ THE Fruites of a close and secret Garden of great ease, and litle pleasure. By C. T. IMPRINTED AT London in Fleet-street by Thomas Marsh. 1581.
❧ TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIP∣FVLL I. R. C. T. WISH∣ETH LONGE AND prosperous lyfe, to the glory and pleasure of Al∣mighty GOD. AFter I had be∣stovved some parte of my inforced ydle time in draw¦ing these few and friuolous lynes of most vayne and y∣dle inuentions, onely of purpose to occupy my mynd, which otherwise, by occasions vvas subiect to receyue a more troublesome & greater incom¦brance: and then bending my selfe to a further intent, to bestow the sowre fruictes of these my ydle gatheringes (thoughe from a place of small plea∣sure)
of some such of my friendes, whose curtesye I supposed woulde vouchsafe very wel to accept of them and in euery perticular poynt to par∣dō my folly: knowing that a litle mite was as wel accepted at the poore wo∣mans hands, comming with a willing mynde, as the great and costly prea∣sēt was at the handes of the rich. I thē setled my selfe vnto a further conside¦ration, and this I wayghed and consi∣dered with my selfe, if I should rash∣ly take vppon me to send vnto one or two, or many of my friends, this litle būdle of trifling toyes: not vnlike but in a short time it might be drawn frō one friende to an other, and so at the lenghth cleane out of the hands of my frendes, into the mouthes of some o∣thers, where perhappes it may bee so champt & mumbled, as it shal cleane be altered from the deacēt forme and shape of mans meate, and made loth∣some to the sight of euerye man, and onley fitte for the mouth of the Hogg. Wherby (beyng desyrous to proceede
in my purpose) I toke occasiō to enter into the imagination of the nature & dispositiō of mā with this intent, that if happily I could find the ciuil & ho∣nest inclinatiōs of some, able to waigh in equal ballance, & coūteruaile with the vnciuil, & dishonest dispositiō of o¦thers, thē would I ye more willingly be bold to aduenture ye publishing hereof to some of my frends, according to my former meanig: & now after a litle de∣liberatiō takē therin, euē as the faulk∣ner, who presently after euery flight, doth hye and hasten hymselfe to take the fruicts of his game from the foote of his hauke: I in the lyke maner cal∣lynge my wittes togeather, haue de∣maū ded a iust accompt of them what they haue gathered accordyng to my purpose, to serue my turne, or at the least to resolue my mynde, and as the Hauke doth open hys foote to yeelde the pray vnto his mayster, sometyme very e gentlye, and sometyme not so easelye, wythout some stryuinge, and wrestynge: euen so also haue
they in the same manner, accordinge to their skill now opened themselues in this sort vntome, as hereafter follo¦weth. According to your appointment wee haue bestowed some time in trauay∣ling and wandringe to and froe, and haue not onely trauest the large and wyld field of this world, but as neare as wee coulde, haue also beaten euery little scrubbe and bushe, wherein to our iudgementes any likely hoode of any thinge was to bee seene, whych possibly might serue your turne. And now as touching those things vvhych at this tyme doe onely concerne our charge, and serue for your purpose, which onely bee pennes and tongues, thus much wee haue gathered togea∣ther of the behauiour & dispositiō of mē therin. In ye opē field we haue sene to the plaine sight of the worlde, that there bee a very greate and infynite number of menne some wyth pennes in they r eares, bendynge themselues onely vnto vvrightinge, some wyth
bookes in their hands, and with great delighte bestowinge all theyr tyme wholly in studye. Some others vvee fynde neyther with Pen, nor Booke, but only with a lump of flesh in their mouthes, so restles, as it seemeth sel∣dom or neuer willgly cōtent to take any rest: of these some be restles onely of zeale & ernest good wil, cōtinually to do good, or els of pleasure to recreat themselues or delight their Fryends, withoute vtterynge at any tyme any cause of offence: some others agayne with their naturall and mother witts do alwais busy & beate their braines, and most vainly occupy their tougues onely in carpinge and snatching, (do∣ing nothing themselues) continually at other mens doinges. On the other syde, of those which geue their minds onely vnto wrightinge, we fynde the dispositions of them bee also diuerse, some to set forth and make playne vn∣to the ignoraunt and common people continually the heauenly and deuine misteryes, onely for the pleasure and
comfort to the Soule of man, some to wryghting of such necessary matters, which onely touch and concerne a cō∣mon wealth, beyng as needful for go∣uernment, as the other is necessarye for comfort other some onely touchg the safe keping and healthful preserua¦tion of mans body, which be the Phi∣sitions. But leauinge to report any further vnto you, of necessarye wri∣ters, we fynd an other kynde of peo∣ple in the plaine and open field, which geue themselues very often to write of pleasure, only to refresh somtimes the weary witts as wel of themselues, as of diuers other men, beyng perhaps long incombred before, with matters of greatter wayght, which for recrea∣tion sake was neuer thought a thinge greatly amisse. Of these we fynd ve∣ry many, which do greatly please and delyght the humoure of the common people, without any iust cause of of∣fence at all, more vnto one man then to another. And now to report vnto you no other
vvyse in euery poynt then according to truth, vvee cannot iustly say, that in the open field wee haue seene anye honest or wyse man, that will take v∣pon him by his penne willingly to iu∣stefye anye vndecent, dishonest, or vncomelye thynge, as wel for mode∣styes sake, as for the preseruation & safe keepinge of their credits: for they know Litterae scriptae manēt, that wri∣tinges remayne a long time, & be al∣wayes verye stronge testimonyes a∣gaynste euerye manne. Therefore wee fynde all menne striue to wright them in as good, and comely order, as possibly they canne. Wee speake generallye euerye manne, because we haue learned this in the worlde, that amonge those kynde of menne, with whom the commendable exer∣cise of wrighting is mostly, & to best purpose vsed; whosoeuer is founde to write otherwise thē according to ho∣nesty and good order, they would not haue him taken or reputed among ho∣nest or wise mē, as a man, but rather as
a rare deformed and mishapen mon∣ster, they thinke no greater discredit can any way fall vpon them, then to haue such a one to beare the name of a companyon amyng them. But yet ful well it is knowne among many of the wyse and learned penmen (and to wel if it might be holpen) yt many nimble witted marchauntes (though besydes very clownish & dul mannered dolts) vnder the counterfect habits of graue and ciuile callynges, doe oftentymes intrude themselues into that cōmen∣dable exercyse, wyth such dishonest and vnseemely behauiour, as the wise are no lesse ashamed, then grieued to thinke of that wicked abuse, thoughe they haue not alwais power to worke redres according to their good willes. But they say, it is taken for a rule in∣fallable among them, that wit, subtil∣ty and wickednes: be thre such louing Brothers, as seldome or neuer to bee founde a sunder: and that wisedome, pollicy, and honest behauioure on the other syde, be thre of the like. And of
our selues we finde by common expe¦rience, that there is no greater vvyc∣kednes in the world, then doth dailye proceede from the witty mā: and yet (beyng as blynd in wisedome, as the man is in sight that hath lost both his eies) when any thing coms from him craftely and wittely deuised, eyther by penne or speach, or any other way: he verely perswades himselfe, that at all handes, he is greatly extold for hys wit, but contrary to that blynde ima∣gination of theirs, wee fynde that a∣mong the wise and learned, they bee had in continuall disdayne: for they say, that neither wit nor learning de∣serues anye reuerence at anye tyme, where honestye wanteth, and as for wisedom, vvhich in the latine tongue is tearmed Sapienti, it beareth conti∣nually with him the substance and sa∣uor of al goodnes, or otherwise it must loose the name, and therefore euer to be had in great reuerence. But to bee shorte, besyde all this, wee fynde by greate hunting and seekinge in euery
corner, & by beating in many bushes, that there is yet an other kinde of peo¦ple which commonly lyke hedgecre∣pers, lye lurkinge in huggermugger, neuer once ventringe out into anye playne or open fielde, if by chaunce they come abroad they come so secret lie, as neuer seene eyther with pen in their eares, with bokes in their hāds, or scarcelye with any tounge in their mouthes: if by chance they wright or speake, it is alwayes in clowdes, in li∣bel manner, and to the defamation, & discredite of some one or other par∣ticular and special man. But these and all other sortes of euill disposed men, wee fynd in this worlde (the good go∣uernment is such) that continuallye they be driuen to silence, and that the wyse and learned men do alwayes go∣uerne the rest, and be the other neuer so subtil or nimble witted, yet cōtinu¦ally they do kepe thē in subiectiō & awe: and therfore thus much now we may boldlye say, that what soeuer is set forth by any mā either for necessi∣tyes
sake to a cōmon wealth, for plea∣sures sake to the wryter, to gratify his friends, & delight hiselfe, or for any o∣ther reasonable or lawful cause (if com¦ly & honest, & any thing tollerable be¦sides, so it be not to ridiculous,) ye mot wise & best learned mā wil least of all condemne him, but rather allowe his forward and willing mynde, for they know it is no commō thing, for euery man to be singuler. Conceyuing thus much, vpō this cō∣sideatiō thus had with my self, I find that though in nūber the wicked & e∣uil disposed men do far surmount the good, yet by auctority, and by good gouernment, the good doth alwayes waygh downe the apparant euils: and God forbide that any apparante wic∣kednesse shoulde euer beare anye sway It hath alwaies bene seene, that one wise and learned man, haue euer bene hable to kepe a thousande other wittye naughty packes continuallye in subiection, and though they starte out somtimes by stealth like the dod∣mond,
or Snaile, yet being once but toucht, they are alwaies fayne to pu home and shrinke in their Horns a∣gayne: and God forbid, that in anye Christian common wealth it shoulde euer be found otherwyse. Therefore now I haue found for my purpose that whatsoeuer I, or any other man shall take vpon hym eyther to speake, or wright, or any other way howsoeuer∣to put in acte: it is onely necessarilye required at euerye hande, that it de∣serue not the iuste rebuke or blame of the vvyse, and honest disposed manne: and as for those which bee contrary, who feareth them, I fynde must feare euery blaste of wynde: for do a manne wel, or do he ill, they will be as ready to fynd faultes, and to blame him, as the wynd wil be to blow vppon him. Wherefore now I haue taken such co∣rage hereby, as I haue imboldned my selfe to fulfill the earnest desire of my mynde, to direct at this tyme, this litle tryfle vnto you, and if the small matter herein contayned, with my
duty and goodwill, may but deserue to be taken in good part at your hāds, wherof I nothing doubt: & also of the wyse, and indifferent reader, whiche hartely I doe desyre, and lightlye to passe ouer some vayne, and vnusuall wordes, which perhaps in diuers pla∣ces here in may be found: then haue I obtayned the substance of my desyre: thus leauing to imagin of, & to answer any other obiectiōs which perhappes may bee inuented agaynst mee,) least beynge to tedyous in troublīg you to much, I here end: and as by duty boūd duringe life to be at your commaun∣demente, do most hartely commende you vnto almighty God. From London the thirde of October. 18.
TO HIS VERY Louinge and especiall friende, olde Oliuer Fyndfault, of Englande, in the countye of Europe Gent. William Woulwell, in most friendlye manner sendeth most hartye greetinges. IF I shoulde so lightlye lett this passe, as hereby to geue fre scope to you my friend and to euerye o∣ther cleheaded penmā, (flowing by dayly practice and experience, in all cunninge, and curious conceiptes, perusing this small pamphlet, which claymeth no other tytle then a toy,) to condemne ye inuentor hereof I should great∣ly iniury him, and not vnworthely of greate folly might condemne my self, in that I haue so rashly thrust him so nakedlye into ye mou∣thes of so manye, wheras perhaps if I had
geuen him warninge thereof he might more strongly and better haue furnished himselfe, but as naked as I founde him, so nakedlye strayght wayes did I prefer him. And ther∣fore the truth is, a very friend of myne beyng driuen from all the benefytes and pleasures of this world, and inforced contrarye to the ordinances and rules of nature to hyde and harbor himself (though as a gultles guest) in a most solitary and dumpish desert, beyng therwith drawen from all ioy and felicity, in in any worldly necessary practise, and rather indeuoring himselfe to recreate, refresh, and delight his mind with some toysh conceipts, then otherwise (being so incōbred) to charge it with any matters of importance or weight for his owne solace and pleasure, bestowed some part of that his ydle tyme in certayne playne and light toyes of inuentiō, not much vnlike therein vnto a certayne ydle kinge in Persia, who in his progresses, did nothig els but continuallye cutt, and whittle stickes, to dryue awaye the tyme. And by reason of my dayly recourse vnto him, beyng priuye ther∣vnto, I craued and obtayned the coppye of this now extant, the which I diuers times and ofte perusynge ouer, toke occasion as a toy, to lyke so well, as I procurde it to the presse, with this title as you see, and thought it as a tokē worthy to send vnto you, to read
whether beyng led there unto, by the greate & good affection I bare to the maker, or by de∣sart of the matter, I know not: but wel wee both know, it is the naturall incliation of friendes, one alwayes to thinke the best of an other. Therefore as I know the first in∣uentor hereof ment nothing lesse, then to put this forth to the publicke construction of the world, to hasarde or aduenture the allowing or disalowing therof: I wil not take vponme to geue out any showe of commendatiō ther∣in at all. Fyrst because I knowe it was not made to that intente, and besydes, least if it should happen to be cōdempned of others as a vayne and tryfling toy, I should therewith also be condempned to haue made a partiall and vnworthye prayse. But syr (if you can rightly consider it) as by the least byrde that flyes in the ayre, by the least fish that swims in the Sea, and by the smallest worme that creepes vpon the earth. The omnipotent & mighty power of God doth as fully & playne appeare, as by the hougest and greatest mō∣sters that beares life in this worlde: euen so by the smalest booke that can be written, by ye most babling ballet that can be made, and by the least word that can be spoken, his strāge and wonderful workes in mā, with his most liberall and incomparable guiftes vnto thē
do as perfectly set forth and shew themselues as by the greatest volume yt euer was writ∣ten, by the wayghtyest or wysest concept that euer was made, or by the most eloquente or learned oration that euer was vttered. The honest wyse and ciuil man doth as little des∣pyse the worst and meanest begger that goeth by the waye, as he geeatly honoureth ye chee∣fest & greatest prince that ruleth in ye world, euen so here the indifferent and wel disposed myndes, wil as litle trippe, or spune at thys stumped, lame, and hauinge toy, as they would greatly fawne vppon, or runne after a more fyne or pleasaunt inuention. But ther is an old prouerb Figulus Figulo inuidit, one Potter hateth an other, the which to auoyd, these may be sufficiently to assure you, in that I know you are a craftes man in that arte, that as for this vnskilful potter, this small trifle and toy is the first that euer hee made, who wil not iustify it to be lawful nor good, in that he was neuer prentice thereunto, and for any he intendes, I dare bouldly say shall be the last, vnlesse it be a little cup or cruese for his owne mouth▪ yet syr if your friendly actions hadde at anye tyme bene▪ agreable vnto your continual colourable showes, you would haue inabled him long before this by your friendly instructions, worthye of your felowship and company.
But vnderstanding he had, though to verye small and litle purpose, some smacke in this your art, as only to take your vessels in hand and to reade them ouer, you alwayes shooke hym of, demaunding a double fee for the tea∣chinge of your skill, much like to amusition, who vsed to take of hysschollare, which had learned before they came vnto him, double soulare, deuble that he toke of others, which neuer learned before, sayinge that hee tooke double paynes with them, as fyrst to make them forget that they had learned before, and then to teach them perfectlye agayne: who if now he were alyue shoulde surelye fynde as small resorte of schollers, as I thinke you do in that you are so curyous in your art. Ther¦fore to imagine this short, and vnpleasaunte sounde, here at this tyme presented vnto your audable and pleasaunt eares, to be but as a preludium, vnto other conceytes, & that he wil stryue to marre your markets, with a∣ny such lyke rough hewen, or mishapen ves∣sels, it shal be in vayn, for be intendes nothig lesse. And as for this small conceipt, here at this tyme, being cast in a very litle mould, & wherin great want of an artifitial workman must needes appeare: I hope you will not stryue to condemne, but rather excuse, though it hath neyther heade to begynne, handle to houlde by, nor foote to stand vpon & though
perhaps neare aboute the end you shall find it very imperfect, and so ful of secrete chinks and litle crantse, as it wil hardly hold liquor without leaking: but if your graue head shal esteeme it as an ydle toy, imagine it (as it is) the fruictes of an ydle place. For phisicke sake I know you haue swallowed many vn∣pleasant and bitter pylles, for friendship sake you may as wel at this time digest this tri∣fling and ydle toy. But if you shal answeare mee, that your such Phisical rescerpts haue alwaies inforced you to vse the pap of an ap∣ple, or els to roule them in suger, otherwise they might haue stucke in your throate: then for answeare agayne, I can but aduise you, for the more easy digesting of this my friend∣ly conceipt, sent onely as a token vnto you & to the rest of my friendes, to roule it in styd of an apple, in the sott asd slyppery pappe of your gentle pattence, or otherwyse (in stead of a suger lofe) in some sweete and sugred spice of your most frienly interpretation: and in this (for the old acquayntaunce of longe tyme continued betweene vs) I hope I shal not fayle but misse of your willing & friend∣ly conformity: and therfore now, since I haue sufficiently declared vnto you, the cause of ye publishing herof, with the dispositiō and in∣tent of the deuisor, and least I shoulde make this my foretrottīg shew or preamble (which
rightly should be but a breefe declaration of what is to come) longer then this his whole rase which is very short, and consideryng my old lesson (worthy in euery act to be remem∣bred and obserued) quod satis est sufficit, I commend me vnto you, you vnto God, and these few lines following vnto your friendly construction. Your assured friend VVilliam VVouldwell.
A SHORT PRELVDIVM to the friendly Reader. Interpone tuis interdum gadia curis TO mingle mirth sometymes vvith care and vsyng neither of them to much Preserues thy body vvel in health, it keepes thy mynd in perfect state. To glutte in sorrovv day and night from day to day, from yeare to yeare, Thou drovvnst thy selfe in drousy moodes, it syngles thee from all thy vvites The hotchpot for varietyes sake is oft accepted of the best And taken as a daynty dish if kyndly mixt vvith diuers tastes Resceites of all preseruatiues vvhere shall you fynde more fyt for health Then vvher the skilful mixtures be in dayly practise to be made. A sugred svveete and syluer sound the musicke mixt doth alvvayes yeeld VVith harmony so heauenly, vvherein no man but greatly ioyes. And here to make a vvindovv fight, out of my mynd, novv to your eyes Since mixtures make all thinges so good, let this my hotchpot beare no blame.
A flickeryng flye vvith fettered feete, fast tyde in scrauling Spyders vveb, A stinking seate of flattering Fleete, vvhere arse he can put out his nebb. A byrde, a beast, more meeter may the vvitles vvoodcock paynt himselfe VVhom beaten seamen did assaye, so oft to vvarne from shollovv shelfe, A guiltles guest and harbored longe in hollovv caue of hardest stone, VVith patience novv doth salue his vvronge. and vvis it vvere his harme alone, From thence this ydle toy doth spring vvher vvere greene nimble vvitseed sovvn Greate crops of toyes that field might bing, and ranke, if oft it vvere not movvne. VVe see vvhen grovvnd is nevvly layed, vvith vveedes and thistles fyrst it springes, VVhen sutes in loue be fyrst assayd, it fyrst vvith triflyng toyes begynnes, Before vvee come to mannes estate, in childish toyes longe tyme vve spend And after then our youthul rate, vve vvalke as vvild til nere our ende.
VVho vvil strong houldes attempt to vvin, do first vvith vveaklinges trye their strēgth, And so the strykers all begin and grovv to courage great at length. Before the souldiour presse to vvarres he musters fyrst in sport to trye And there if fit, the boulder dares aduenture then in field to dye. VVe likevvise see vvhen plants do spring, before their leaues can spread abrode, First forth their litle buds must bring, and then at length their bovves they lode, Thus euery thing if rightly vvayde, vvith tryfles small doth fyrst begin Rightly therfore it is not sayd, this tryfling toy great blame doth vvinne. A needful thing in common vvealth no man, nor vvoman thinkes to long. VVhich soule or body bringes to health but still more more is all their song A tryfling toy in priuate sporte if tedious vvorkes vvithout delight, Blame not therfore this ioy though short vvhich needles here is brought to light.

THe godly, polliticke, & wise gouern∣ment of the one, wt the wicked, subtil, & diuilish illutions of the other, euer since their beginning & first entring into field of worldly fight, which was when Adam at the first subtle intisement, & temptinge tounge of Eue, fyrst puld the Apple of ye tree, is by many learned and godlye auc∣tors far mor aptly discribed, better set forth, more largelye & playnly publyshed then possibly by anye here at this tyme, can be spoken or imagined. And the lyke I may say of euerye other particular theame, in this shorte, & small pamphlet hereafter following. For euery litle strayte and norrowe path which here is taken woulde most easilye conduct and playnly lead a most cunning and perfite penman into a moste ample, and large field most pleasant and necessa∣ry. And therefore leauinge that wyde and fertil field wherin most sweete, holesom, and necessarye flowers of greate good, and requisite matters might bee gathe∣red (as to intreate now at this present of
these three vyses and fower virtues, with the substance of euery other mat∣ter hereafter followinge,) I rather bende my iourney forthwith according to the tytle of this toy, into a more se∣crete and syldome used garden, where I intende not to gather of all sortes of flowers such plenty as to make therof a great and goodly garland, but rather more likely no flower of plure at al. For wel do I know, that hardly should I finde (were I in place neuer so plen∣tifull) such a flower of pleasure or de∣lyght, which hath not alreadye hereto∣fore, by some or other bene presented vnto many tender noses, who perhaps if agayne they should be tryed with the lyke, would rather stop their noses, & disalow therof, beyng so oft cloyde with such accustomed sauors, thē they would prayse the sweetnes thereof were it ne∣uer so pleasaūt, which we dayly see by great experience, as for example this for one amonge many others may well bee noted, yt when wanton youth most
wyldlye flyinge here and there exercy∣sing the youthful winges of his vncon∣stant and flickeringe mynd, frō place to place, light happily vpon some fertile, and pleasaunt ground, where he fynds great plentye of sweete and comforta∣ble flowers: then settelynge his mynde according to the humour of his eye, hee syts him downe as it were vppon some one chois spetial moulehil neere vnto to the flower he best delytes: and there resting his bodye from tyme to tyme, (though with a restles mynde) rather willing to feede the desire of his wantō eye. in stil perusing & beholding his cho∣sen & long eye bitten flower, then to sa∣tisfy his hungry and needy stomacke, wt any other nourishing or necessary food: at length after many bashful, & priuate attemptes, sometyme handling ye stalk & oftentymes kissing the leaues: gathe∣ring vp some crummes of courage, sud∣daynly takes it vp by the rootes, & ca∣ryes it cleane awaye: which lightly hee kepes for a tyme most louingly, some∣while in his hand, somewhile in his bo∣some
and strayght in his lap, somtyme to his nose, some tyme to his lips, & not vnlike but somtyme to his bed: for that he wakes no soner in ye morning then he desyres to haue it neere his nose, to bee short, his delightes be such therein, as who knows not that he esteemes it be∣fore all other growinge herbes, or flo∣wers vnder the sunne: he loues it accor∣ding to the old saying of the poet Ana∣creon, as a sweete mischiefe, and with the saying of Propertius, as a sweete ty∣ranny because he indureth his tormēts willingly, & is sildome content to settle or quiet his mynde where he lyues, but alwayes there where hee loues. Hee stickes not for the loue thereof to aduē¦ture the ouerthrow of his owne body wt Roderick of Spaine, who lost his king∣dome for the loue of Camma: or to en∣terprise the deathe and destruction of a straunger, with Retormodicus, who o∣uerthrewe ye whole state of the Lacede∣monians for the loue of Scedasus daugh¦ters, & wt Cateline, who slue his owne sonne for the loue of Orestilla. And all this not withstandinge, after a whyle,
his eager sight beyng once satisfyed, a the rest of his senses which before toke their delightes: grow as greate to mi∣slikingr as before in theire first begin∣ning they kyndled and grew to loue, a thing no lesse straunge vnto all such as stil remayne free their flower to chose, thē it were miraculous for ye hot moūt Aetna, to become the cold hil Caucasus, & whose lo soeuer, it is to tread ye world do not vnlikely stūble oftentymes vpon many such (though lost and cast away) pleasant and sweete flowers. This ex∣ample the worlde ouer is dayly seene. And therefore now, since that such fa∣mous inuentions be so cunningly deuy∣sed, and seuerallye knyt vp togeather, you may for a pēny haue in your pocket choyse of many prety toyes at al times to delight you. I know it were now in vayne for me to striue to gather ye like, though my inforced ydle leasure might wel serue therūto, for in yt it should be superfluous, it woulde rather greatly yr thē any thing at al delight: but my
intent is (though I bee longe in com∣ming therto) in this my chosen and so∣litary Garden, to pick out ye most try∣flyng and vaynest weedes that possiblye may be foūd, and therwith to make (to passe my weary tyme) a small and litle poesy, the rather for that I know, many be so cloyde with pleasaunt and sweete sauors, as they oftentymes seeke for most filthy and sinking weedes to sinel vpon. But as I woulde not stryue be∣yonde my skill to pricke this ful of ple∣asaunt and delectable flowers, euen so would I be loth to poyson it with such vnholesome and sinking weedes as it should yeeld too fylthy or yrksome a sa∣uour. Therfore if I be not deceyued, it shal yeeld very barely any sauor eyther sweete or lower at all: and in o doinge as the sweetenes shal litle delite you, ye sower tast shall as little offende you. And therfore to be short, leauing these circumstaunces and endles rownd run∣ning about the bush. The first begin∣ning hereof (though more brieflye then cunningly) showes the weake and fble
entring of man first into this wicked worlde nourished vp, and safelye kept by three chosen nurses (though in more soft and gentle bandes) not much vn∣like to the pore captiues and prisoners vnder the custody and chaynes of theire appoynted gaylors, vntill the Session dai of their gail deliuery: wher straight they reseaue their iudgemēts (as by the law rightly condempned) to bee led into the wyde wildernes of this wretched world, wher (as pilgrims) passyng lōg youthful and wearye tyme, some lyght happely into the hands of good & God∣ly disposed men, some into the hands of most cruel tyrāts, whose simple, sēceles & bruish mynds serue thē cōtinually to tormēt and destroy ye next vnarmed na∣weake men, yt by chaunce fall into their deuilish dints, in reuēge of some iniury done vnto them before theyr equals, or superiours: from the which I pray god deliuer me, & preserue al others. Some agayne are chosen and placed in princely seat of rule: some in place of diuine coū∣sell, some in place to ourish and seede
a cōmon wealth, some to cure the sick, and diseased bodies, and some continu∣ally in place to deceaue the whole world with whom no sticklers at any time, as yet coulde euer preuale, til death him selfe in proper person, coms to play his most playne and vnskilfull quarters, as hereafter in this small Pamper, doth more playnly & briefely appere, a thing though vnfily intermingled with such idle and vayne inuentions, and though vnaptly bearyng the title aboue named in that the name of god ought neuer to be so taken in vayne as once to bee na∣med vnder the title of such a toy: yet my intent, and matter therin considered, it shall not bee greatlye amis, if by the reader it may be construed to the best: (which I desire) for I stryue not to iu∣stefy the perfectnes therof, informe, in style, in matter, or in any thyng. And therefore I may not otherwise but cō∣mend it (as a tryling oy) vnno the best and most friendly construction.

ANd therfore the necessary & wayghty force hereof consi∣dered, who could most cun∣ningly or closly conuay him∣selfe into the sight of this most cruell &
cōtinual battaile) bearyng alwaies be∣fore his body, true faith, as his buckler, & placing constancy as a sure bulwarke of defence, should doobtles daily behold far more wonderful wracke, & destruc∣tion, with more secrete subtil pollicies & deceiptes, thē through ye whole world in any our accustomed bloudy conflicts, betwixt man & mā, he could possibly see al dayes of his life. No blowes be ther to be seene, no noyse to be hard, no vaūt of victory at any tyme to bee made, the slaughter be it neuer so great, is euer st and scilēt. Al deadly wounds being there daily and howerly infinite and in∣numerable one only Phisition doth al∣wayes cure, who farre beyond all art, doth so continually strengthen and re∣fresh all those incāped and fightynge souldiers, as from the tyme they first pitched their field vnto this day the bat¦tayle neuer quailde, nor yet till the last hower euer shall. But now beyng out∣ward (as an vnskilfull passīger of this my shorte and easye iourneye, yf I should contrary to my farmer promise,
forsake my playne and easy trot, and so∣denly fal into a more swift, and curious pace, intending to leape and runne be∣yond my limits into this wyde fielde, & world of continuall warre. Uppon my returne agayne, you woulde certaynly expect a perfect & true report of some great and wonderful newes, the order and manner of their field, with discrip∣tion of some notable late battaile, and conquest, with many other questions, which (for want of experience) I cānot imagine: and then if my iudgemēt, dis∣position, eloquence, and memorye (he chiefest tooles, and instruments of eue∣ry cunning and perfect wise messenger) being tried with the touchstone of some artificiall workeman: shall appeare so vtterlye voyde of anye good, or perfite mettall, as in no parte able to per∣fourme what is loked for,  shall iust∣ly be condempned, in so foolishly disclo∣sing mine owne imecility & weaknes: which otherwise by scilēce I might stil haue cōcealed. Therfore I wil not take vpon me as a messenger of any skill, to
make any report therof. But whosoe∣uer can wysely and wel dispose himself shal more fitly be his owne messenger. And ther may behold the innumerable number of worldlinges, hauinge conti∣nually their desyred fort in view, dayly marching forward therunto, howe by many subtill and secrete pollicyes they they be alwayes forestald, & stopt theyr waye, and shall playnly see, agaynst e∣uerye lone and single man, thre most stronge and mightye aduersaryes, the world, the flesh, and the deuil, who cō∣tinually keepe themselues most strong∣ly in armes, hauinge wonne ye rule and dominion of the greatest parte of the worlde, onely leauing a most narrow & straight lane vnto this our fort and ca∣stle of rest, wherin standes Vertue, be∣yng at continuall warre and defiance a∣gainst those deadly and mortal enemies of man, as strongly and as surelye fur∣nished against them, as possiblye may be. With continuall becks and signes: not fayling dayly and howerly to sende her secrete priuy scoutes, and messen∣gers
from man to man, to instructe and geue vs knowledge of that narrowe and secret way, and therwith neuer re∣fuseth, to such as be willing to followe her to accompany and assist them, with what strength she can possibly make▪ to safecanduite and leade them through ye thickest of theire ennemyes. But this vertue (beynge a continuall and open fiend vnto vs) with all her most & strō∣gest furniture of munition and defēce, is dayly met withall, and incountered and yet strongly abides those continual conflictes, sometyme escaping with vi∣ctorye, and sometyme with losse: but most syldome doth she returne conque¦red vnlesse the dissemblinge Captiue (whom her purpose is to safecunduit & defende) most cowardlye quayles, and shrynkes from her by the way. The pore souldiour, is no soner espyed by his diligent dayly attendantes, the world, the flesh, and the deuil, to be cre∣aping a way vnder the bāner of vertue, but strayghte they flye vnto him with as sure hold as possible may be, & then
beyng faynt harted, easy to be assured, by their glorious and subtill outwarde showes of deceyt, hee easily lets goe his hould by vertue, and yeeldes to their ty∣xaous (though secrete) fleshly, & car∣nall tugges. But contrariwyse if he be so strong of courage not easy to be cari∣ed by any secrete or subtil whyrlwynde, or so wary in wisdome and foresight, as to eschew all their forewarned snares, and willing to withstand those his en∣nemyes vnto death, then shee most lo∣uingly, and readily imbraceth hym, as her adopted child: and then to beholde how gently and easily she lyke a natural mother, drawes hym by little and little, out of the tearynge Teeth of those most cruell tyrantes, and how cunningly and carefully shee striues to cary him safely throughe their daungerous and cruell force, it woulde doubtles dryue all her strongest ennemies most earnestlye and faythfully to loue, honor, and obay her, euen to the end. And thus in vewynge the secret and cunning warres bētwixt the world and
this our mortall life, (wherein much more may bee vnderstode, then by this ydle pen, can possibly bee vttered) our subtill and secrete ennemyes wee shall the better eshew, and our safest way to the castell and seate of euerlasting rest, shall more easilye learne, which (as seemes is not the broade and common beaten way, but rather a very narrow and sildome troden mossey lane. And as our foresayde aduersaries with al their armye, and might be dayly remayning in the one, geuinge vs continuall re∣pulce in all attemptes vnto this our e∣uerlasting fort: and trayninge vs lyke dronken myse into theire flatterynge pytfalles of euerlastinge destruction: Euen so our most louing and naturall friend vertue. with al her power conti∣nually possesseth the other (which is ye narrow lane) alwayes readye on the o∣ther syde, there to resceaue vs in. And theruppon is it written, though other∣wyse. as wel it may be vnderstood) Patet quae perdit. &c.
❧ The friendly gree∣ting and comminge togeather betwene Idlenes, & a student. THe godly & wel dis∣posed man, satlingeStudent. hymselfe both in bo∣dy and mynd, (bow∣yng as faythfully the knees of his hart, as many do faynedly in most dissemblynge manner the knees of their outward bo∣dyes) vnto his deuoute meditations, & prayers, is very sensably to his feeling as he certaynlye thinkes, pulled often∣times by the head oft times by the legg▪ and some tyme by other parts of the bo∣dy. It is not a thinge strange or rare to be heard of, that most straunge & terri∣ble visions haue also appered vnto such kynd of men, to moue them vnto terror and feare of purpose to remoue them from their such deuotion and prayer: who it is, or what it is, that doth worke
and bryng such continual lettes, and i∣cumbraunces vnto them, I leaue to the graue and learned deuynes, whose pro∣fession (for want of knowledge)  nei∣ther dare, nor can take vpō me to shew: yet for my playne and short opiniō ther∣in, I thinke it is the secrete snatching, and priuy byting degge of hel. But the godly and holy men are so day∣ly & hourly bittn therwith, as come ye deuil himselfe, his dog, or his damme, or what saynt soeuer of his hee listes to sende, the ofter they fele themselues bit¦ten, and snatcht at, the ofter and more greatly do they take occasiō therby, not onely to pray the more deuowtly, but al∣so more hartelye to reioyce vnto them∣selues, knowing that the deuil, with al hys companye of Angelles, is neuer so diligent and eager in busyinge himselfe to winne, but where he lighteth in such running company of gamsters, as he is alwayes in feare to loose, which ys ne∣uer among dysers, and carders, nor yet in any alchouse, or ryplynge pastymes,
neuer in any feasting, or banketinge, nor in braue and gorgious showes, nor yet in any one delyght, or worldly pleasure at al, for in some of these, as in continu∣all dysing and cardinge, which is neuer without swearyng and staring, in con∣tinuall feasting and banketting whiche is neuer without dronkennes, and glut∣tony with such lyke, he is neuer in fear among thē, as once to loose. But which of them soeuer can best and most clean∣ly beare his ale, or with hys cunninge slaightes and ingling trickes, deceaue most, and win of all the rest. he denill for his part is sure at the end as cleanly to beare him, and as cunninglye to win them all, and as in worldly delytes hee lykewyse resteth hymselfe quiet, neuer offering any trouble or disquiet vnto a∣ny of them, onely in hope that the plea∣sures of the world wil be sufficient in∣strumentes to drawe them also to the bente of hys bowe, as well as if he him∣selfe were in presence among them: & this appeiseth his bottomles and insa∣tiable gulph,
desyrous if possibly he might to drown and draw vnto himselfe, the pore inno∣centes and soules of al the worlde. But there be many godly and well disposed men, who by the continuall helpe, and inspiration of the holy Ghost, haue at all attemptes as great cunninge to pre∣uent hym, as he hath alwayes subtillye in seeking to tempte and deceaue them: they neuer muse or start at anye of hys sodayne or secrete shadowes, but conti∣nuallye laboure and bend themseues to withstand his such wicked deuises. And now to shew my present and secret trouble, euen so in the verye same man∣ner, though not setling my selfe in the lyke Godlinesse of deuotion, as before mentioned, yet bendyng my selfe vnto a worldly and necessary studye, I feele e∣uen now of late very censably & playnly many secret and priuy twitches, but by whom I cannot imagine (hearing nor seyng any thing at all,) as for the deuil I hope it is not, for man or woman it cannot possibly be: and therfore (desy∣rous to follow as nere as I canne, the
steppes of these godly, and well dispo∣sed mē,) what soeuer it is, vntil I hear further therof, I wil not so easily be o∣uercome. Idlenes. Sir to driue you from your dumps and great admirations, it is euen I. Studient. Friend Idlenes, I may not say wel∣come. But since you are come, geue me your hande: what was the cause, that you so oft & so secretly puld me by the sleeue, that I could neuer neither see, nor heare you? Idlenes. Oh syr, it was for verye mere good will which I did beare, as alwayes I haue borne most willingly vnto you. For loking priuely and peping ouer your shoulders, and seynge you so ear∣nestly
besyde your booke. I thought wt my selfe, if sodaynlye I shoulde haue blowen out my trumpet, or haue brea∣thed any loude sounde, or synging into your eares, or if sodainly I should haue appeared vnto you, I mighte perhaps haue so frighted, and driuen you vnto such a sodayne start and terrible feare, as durynge your lyfe euer after, you mighte thereby haue fallen into some wonderful and great paulsey: and ther∣fore in the most gentle and frēdly man∣ner I coulde, I easily and priuily (fea∣ring your such disturbance) puld you by ye sleeue: Whereupon hearynge you so grauely beginning your grounde, and running such descant vpon the Deuill, hys dogge, and his damme, I stoode a longe tyme (as though greatle ama∣zed) expectinge your laste stroke, and how you would make your close: wher∣by at length, I might plainly perceyue you in a manner likened mee (though not named) vnto the Deuill and hys dogge, which (consideryng my continu∣all
friendlye mynde towardes you) I could not chuse, but take very vnkynd∣lye. Student. Friend iniury, I knowe you haue not bene so baselye brought vp in beggers bosome with ignoraunce, but that you do as well know the order and course of this worlde, as the greattest learned, & most famous Clarke of all: your white heade, and many yeares in greate expe∣rience haue brought you sufficiēt know∣ledge, to counteruayle the best: conti∣nuall companye and oft handlynge doe bryng the wyld and brutish beastes, at ye length to be tame: and manye Byrdes, as Parattes, and Pyes, with such lyke oftentymes to speake. Experience tea∣cheth vs, that companye many tymes doth worke greate wonders: and what is it that company will not cause, The old Prouerbe is, that companye often∣tymes doth make many olde men verye good cookes: and my frend take you frō
company take your heade from your shoulders. Somtyme like a roge, and shakeragge, halfe naked, a man may fynd you daūcing among beggers, some while brawling, and fighting, and some time cracking of lice, somtime in mean apparaile, in tauernes, and tipling hou∣ses, tossing, and swilling, and cracking of crownes, sometyme agayne, in most braue and gorgious attyre, a companiō with the best: to be short, of what estate or calling is he of, into whose company sometyme or other, you haue not intru∣ded your selfe. Therfore beyng so well acqnaynted, as I know you are with the natures, and dispositions of all men, it semeth verye straunge vnto me, that now you shoulde seeme so ignorant of me, as to take anye thing vnkindly whatsoener I haue spo∣ken of you: for you know right wel, that notwithstanding most men are content secretly oftentymes to entertayne you, yet few or none at any tyme, but roges and knaues, dare for their credits sake, openly allow or commend you: it can not
bee also vnknowen vnto you, that you haue alwayes bene cronacled to be yt au∣thor and mother of all mischiefe & vice, calling your wits togeather, and remē∣bring your selfe, you know more herein thē I can tel you. Therfore neuer take the wordes of your friende, when they seeme to offende you, but rather hys mind. For notwithstanding my former speech I wil not be to curious, nor shye of your company, a wyse mā (I know) sometyme wil admit of the simple foole and prating knaue to sit at hys bord, the one to make sport in laughing, ye other in talkinge, and both to passe away the tyme: for a yonge man to bee alwayes graue, vntil his very roote beginnes, & growes to bee gray: were surely in my concept as greate a follye in hym, as if alwayes he should be ydle. Therfore my friend, since now you haue so gently, so aduysedly, and so friendly presēted your selfe vnto me, and beynge I knowe the messenger and seruante, and atturney of an atturney, discourage not your selfe at any thing I haue spokē, but euen as
bould as you would be with the great∣test acquayntāce you haue, be euen now as bould with mee, & acquaynt me with the cause of your comming. Idlenes. Syr as you haue sayd I confesse in e∣uery part it is true, I fynd now greate reasō doth wish me to take in very good part what soeuer ye haue alreadye spo∣ken, or shal hereafter euer speake. A QVESTION, BY IDLE∣nes put forth to the Studente. SIr, if my vayne and ydle motions, shoulde not trouble your graue and well occupyed mynde, I woulde with your patience craue your aduyse and iudgement in a matter (though verye common and easy) wherin at this time my ydle braynes be some thing basyed.
Student. My busines is not so greate, but I may very wel afford to graunt you au∣dyence, and also answeare you if neede shal so require, & therfore let me heare your mynd, and shew mee the trouble∣some and clammye way wherein you, sticke, and if my skill may possiblye worke you out a more playne and easye passage, you shall not lōg misse of your such earnest desire. Idlenes. Sir, since your curtesy is so great to bend your self so gently, & so friendly towards me, I hope I shall not neede in hast to scrangle my wittes togeather in vtteryng my mynd at this tyme vnto you, for I haue so oftentymes hereto∣fore, & euen now of late to my cost, foūd ye old prouerbe to be true, that hast ma∣keth wast as now wherin I may chuse I wil rather crepe with the snayl, then runne with the Harte: for wee see by experience, that the slowest going: Asse ys alwayes the surest bearynge beast,
the slowest winged hauke (if any thing good besides) doth commonly shew the best sport, and kepes her selfe longest from any mischaunce: for hast we see yt many of the femenine sex, haue sodayn∣ly fallen backwarde to many incurable and great mishaps, and of men, as ma∣ny haue tumbled headlonge forwarde, puttinge themselues in daunger of as greate perril. do wee not dayly se, that many for hast offer to put meate into their mouthes, gaping full wyde, and yet puts it besydes? and many wt spone meates, before their mouthes can be o∣pen, chop the spone agaynst their teeth, and all to besquatter their lippes and beardes if they haue any? do not manye drinke so hastely, as sometime very sud∣denlye they almost quackle, and choke themselues, and then (if ashamed) wil say I haue drunke a crum? haue you not knowen diuers men, and sometyme many women, to fare ye worse for their snatching. Such as can tary tyme and leasure do cōmonly fare best, & yet I a∣gree ye tarier thinks always long, vnto
what tyme this tarying must haue re∣latiō, I leaue it vnto them of that kind. But to descant a litle further vppon this playne and hasty ground: if I shal not trouble you to longe: haue you not heard that sometyme a man hath falue in company by channce with a woman, as it were vppon the frydaye, and hath beddid her vpon saterday, wedded her vppon Sunday, and al torepented him∣selfe vppon munday? if repentaunce in such be differd for 2. dayes, it is a mar∣uayle, but if for a weeke, it is a greate wonder: such is the nature of hast, sone rype, sone rotten, sone hot, sone colde, sone done, sone repented, the wordes of auncient and wyse men are oftentimes heard among vs, but little regarded of any: they haue set downe this for a rule Quod semel faciendum, diu deliberā∣dū: whatsoeuer is but once to be done, and once done, neuer agayne to bee vn∣done, doth alwayes require greate de∣liberation, and long to be considered of before▪ but the Elephāt being a houge and brutish Beast without reason, doth
better obay and follow this rule by na∣ture, then we hauing reason can by oft and continual perswasions: for hee kno∣wing by nature, that if once he chaunce to fall downe he must neuer loke to rise agayne, doth loke so narrowlye to his footīg, as he neuer setteth step without greate deliberation: when the naturall rest of sleepe coms vpon him, he gets him presētly vnto some tree, and therto leaning himselfe so taketh his rest. And is the fall of the Elephant greater to ye earth, then the fall of a man into a curst Xantippa, or into the handes of an e∣gregious shrew? verily I thinke it cā¦not possibly be, is it not then needful for the man to looke with the Elephant, twise aboute him before hee leape: the wyse man sayth insipientis est dicere: &c it is a greate show and token of an vnwyse man, when you hear him say, if I had knowen this or if I had knowen that, for if rashiye he bec sped, it is the best wisedome quietly to whist himself. I remember a familiar example of a very wyse and playne man in the coun∣trey,
who for his patience in bearinge that Kynd of affliction, hath bene kept a long tyme in remembraunce: hee and hys wyfe keeping continuallye so close togeather, as sometyme fast tyde toge∣ather by the eares: vnderstandinge the place and tyme appoynted, where such a famous and learned mane shoulde preach, they agreed in due time louīgly to goe togeather arme in arme, and cheeke by checke, pressing so in that lo∣uing maner as nere to the Preacher as possibly they coulde. And after a whyle the Preacher entringe into greate dis∣course of many matters, seruing fit for his text, among diuers other thinges fell into speach how Christ beare hys crosse, and after many learned and god∣ly exortatiōs opened therin, he remem∣bred the sayinge in the scripture: Who soeuer wil bee my seruant, must take vp his crosse and follow me: at which words this honest man hauing his wife arme in arme, as though sharply prickt with a sodayne motion, sayd immediat∣lye vpon a sodayne vnto the Preacher:
Syr, that will I with all my harte, and thervpon presently hosting vp his wyfe vppon his shoulders as well as he coulde, with al speede began to depart, but the preacher and the rest of the con∣gregatiō, blamīg him as little for that his zealous and godlye mynde, as they greatly maruayled at that his strange & rare example, caused him to be staide and eased of hys heauy burden, and af∣ter this the preacher proceeding to hys purpose, and finishing his Sermon, he caused this honest man and his wyfe to brought before him in the presence of ye whole congregation, and knowing him by report to be a very wyse mā, demaū∣ded openlye of him the cause of this so∣dayne motion: he boldly and openly an∣sweared him. Why syr was it not your saying, that he that wil be the seruante of God, must do as christ did, in takinge vp his crosse & following him, and that our crosse that we most beare, is ye tro∣bles and afflictions of this worlde: the preacher answeared him it was true, & so was the saying of the scripture, then
sayd the honest man, if this bee true I hope I haue not offended, if I wil be a seruant vnto God, I must needes cary some crosse, and troubles of this world for I haue hard, that Nullus sanctorū coronatus sine flagello vel certamine, and for my part I haue no other crosse, nor trouble in this world but only this my deare wyfe, who is as diuilish a dame, as curst a shrew, as madd a ma∣kin as euer puld man by bearde, and if you haue any other crosse to tell mee of then her, which I must beare, I hope God wil pardon mee, and so must you, for I know I shal not be able to liue to endure ye burthē▪ I liue (God knowes) full hardly and wearely with this. The preacher sayd vnto him: honestman I know you are counted wise, I find it is for your honest and good behauiour ye you be so wel estemed of, and not for any gret knowledge or vnderstāding which I thnyke you will clayme vnto your selfe: it semeth you haue better vnder∣standing in your husbandry, in your oc∣cupation, or in some other handcrafte,
whatsoeuer it is, then you haue in the knowledge of any Diuine reasons, but liuing honestly and wel (as appears by your good report) and being so willing and diligent to geue eare vnto your tea∣cher, in that I know euery man cannot be a cunninge clarke (for then manye a theefe should escape the allous) I do fynde the lesse cause to blame you, but rather I am to instruct you according to the truth, which is my office & to be∣stow my tyme in teaching the ignorant people. Therfore you must vnderstand that to beare the crosse and troubles of this world, it is not to beare them vpō your shoulders, but you must beare thē that is, you must indure them, and take them with a quiet and patient mynde, & as a punishment sente from God, for your sumes. then sayde the honest man vnto him againe. Sir, I confesse my ig∣norance, and do wish that I hadde more knowledge, as for your counsaile I wil willingly fellow as nere I can, my comming was to the same purpose: but whereas you say, I must not take nor
beare, the worldlye afflictions vpon my shoulders, but indure them wt a patient mynde, I say that if you had my wife, or such an other but for one yeare, you should fynd, you must not onely indure with a patient mynd, but you should al∣so haue ynough to doe, to beare of both with head, shoulders, back, & legges, and euery other part of your body: ther∣fore, sir, you speake well, and lyke one of great learning but of litle experiēce, and God forbid that you should haue ye like experience herein as I haue foūd, and perhappes many other. The prea∣cher makinge hast to bee gone, and lea∣uinge anye further at that tyme to ex∣hort hym, sayde, at his departure: ho∣nest man (as it seemeth) you are won∣derfully incumbred with a merualous curst and diuilish shrewe, farr worse as appereth most true, then the common sorte of shrewes, for they bee all tolle∣rable ynough, and by this your report which beareth indeed some credit, beīg so honest a man, I must needs say, this
wyfe of yours is intollerable, therfore you may do well for your more quiet, & better ease, to seke some lawful sepeta∣tion betwixte you, and that is the beste counsayle that I, or any man els in this case canne geue you: for thoughe I haue no experyence, yet by reason I fynd there is no stryuinge with a diui∣lish dame. I hope there bee not manye such in the worlde, and so I leaue you. Then sayde the other agayne, for all your good counsayie hetherto I harte∣ly thanke you. But now whereas at ye wynding vp, you seme to geue me coū∣sayle to leaue my deare wyfe. Which is onely the crosse I haue in this worlde, wherby I must goe in ye world to come to lyfe euerlasting. I thinke your doc∣trine therin not to my best commodity, and then taking his wyfe by the hande, sayd vnto her, come wyfe, lette vs goe home togeather agayne, as louingly as wee came forth: and since I haue now learned that thou art the only mean to bringe mee to heauen. I will now che∣rish thee more then euer I did before.
but I hope I shall not neede: for if I do by chaunce sometyme forget you, I hope you wil not forget your selfe, and now because you fynd that I haue some greater care of you, then heretofore I would be loth you should now seeke, by pensiuenes to shorten your owne lyfe, for then I may be thought to kill you wt kyndnes. In this order during his lyfe did this wyse manne content himselfe, with hys vnaduised and hasty choyse. More hast then good speede is neuer to be liked, soft fyre maketh sweete malt, but to take hast after another sēce, they say a hasty man maketh a hasty womā, a gentle and soft manne doth alwayes make a soft and gentle woman: the ha∣sty man in rebuking his wyfe openlye. resembles him that spyts into ye winde and receyues it agayne vppon his face: but perhappes you wil say that none be of that mnd but women: yes truely it is the mynd of many wyse men: for exā∣ple sake, loke wher you can fynd a wise man, that to the sight of the world, and in very deede will not allowe his wyse
to be mayster when she list, and then on the other syde, looke where you can find a foole whose wife will not tremble to speake, and be affrayd to loke asyde of any man in ye presence of him. The wise scholmayster sayth, it is neuer meete to keepe that child in to much awe & feare which by nature is so gentle & tractable as the mildes of his face, doth alwaies confesse his fault, and euen so sayth the wyse man of the woman, that shee yeel∣ding alwayes ye man to be her head, and by nature commonly subiecting herself willinglye vnto hym, it were a greate fault to keepe her also in continual sub∣iection, and therfore amonge wyse men it is alwayes taken for a rule, the hum∣ble must euer be exalted: among the o∣ther sort they must be contented to bee alwayes oppred, and troden downe, yet sometyme wee see the most harebraynd of all is surely yokt, and stept with the Goose from creepinge through euerye hedge, or scarce to goe out of anye nar∣row dore.
But looke which way wee will, ey∣ther one waye or other, to what sence soeuer this woorde Hast is best & most fittest to bee wresed (vnlesse that it be a hasty pudding.) I cannot possiblye y∣magine or thinke whiche waye, or by what meanes it canne well bee allow∣ed of. Wee dayly see by commō experince hasty men neuer wante woe, and what thing soeuer is done with ouer much hast, is commonly repented by leasure. Therefore Syr, I will not at this tyme fall sodaynlye into the depth of my desyre here at thys tyme with you, for pleasures sake onely: since it is the first tyme of our meeting togeather, by your patience we wil walke a little to∣geather by the waye: and sith that time doth serue vs both so well, I would bee gladde to craue your short opinion here∣in. I haue harde it a question. (beynge dyuers tymes▪ my selfe in companye) whether it is better to bee ydle, or to be ill occupyed.
Student. Friend ydlenes, not vnlyke but you haue bene in companye where this and many other lyke friuolous questions haue commonlye bene canuased to and froe, and nothing at all vnfit for your e∣ducation. But if I should take vpō me to answeare this your question, and yeeld a reason of some betternes in the one of your propositions, I hadd neede to pul some logition by the sleeue, as you haue done mee, and craue his ad∣uyce, as yon intende to do myne: for as I take it in this your question is inclu∣ded an equiuocall and doubtfull sence, which requireth the artificial tooles of Logicke, to make it smooth and playne as wel to the eare as to the eye, and I meane not at this tyme to wade to far, and so wantonly with you, I will take your wordes as the lye: and as by com∣mon attendment they are to bee taken, and so shall you briefly heare myne opi∣nion according to your desire: you are not to learne, that one question may be answered by puttīg forth an other: ther¦fore
my frend, admit a mā should bring you two crowes, and demaunde of you whe∣ther is the whiter, beyng both (as com∣monly they be) as blacke as a cole: were it possible your skyll could reach so far to yeelde a reason the one to bee whiter thē the other? if I knew you were a lo∣gitian, I woulde not doubte but you might do som thing wt your cūning fal∣latiōs: but beyng as you are, you must be contente to take onely your mother wit, and leaue that skilfull art, and by your natural reason you shall hardlye proue blacke to be whyte, or naught to be good. Therfore your question being this, whether it is better to be ydle, or ill occupyed, I may answeare you brie∣fly, nether barrel better herring: wher you would haue one thinge better then another, you must first allow the one of them to be good: for better is a degree of comparison from good, and neither of these do good. How then can I iudge which of them is better: Idlenes. If I may be bolde to interupt your
talke, how would you behaue your self if this question were demaunded, of you in the presence of such who haue no artificiall skyll in reasoning at all, as if you were amonge a number of women woulde you not swarue a whitt from art, and fal to some vayne and ydle rea∣sones you knowe full well that they are neuer brought vp eyther in Logicke or Rethoricke. Therefore amonge them, eyther you must talke according to their vnderstā∣dinge, or els continuallye bee scilente, which would argue much ignoraunce, or rather great dulnes in you. Student. If I were in companye of neuer so many, I confesse I could haue very lit∣tle to say, I do but I shoulde be as the Oule amōg a number of birdes, rather amazed to heare theire continuall chir∣ping, then any waye able to answeare such kynd of questions.
Idlenes. Why sir, and would you also lye as the Oule doth, vppon your backe, and crye too witt, too woo? I woulde wish you rather to lye grouelyng vpon your belly to hyde yonr bashful face. Student Nay frend iniurye, I am no crooked byld byrde, I mynd not so to crye, ney∣ther to fall forward nor backward, the place should be very flippery if I kept not my footing, and besides, I woulde not grratly sticke to endeuor my selfe to yeeld the best reasons I coulde to feede theire phantasies, but I am not yet a∣mong them, we may talke therof at lea¦sure: I am now onely in ye cōpany of an idle pack, & haue graūted to debate som matters wt you, according to our 2 fan∣tasies at this tyme alone. And therfore now to proceede towards the end of my answer vnto your headles question, I must put you in mynd of a sentence out of Tully, for beyng as I haue sayd, that your question is of two euils, we must proue which is the least, and not ye best, for saith he, duorū malorū minimū ma lum est elegendum.
of two euilles the least is alwayes to be chosen. Idlenes Once agayne you must pardon me, I must be bold to interrupt you. You say it is the sayinge of a wise man, that of two or many euils the least is alwayes to be chosen: surelye that your speech doth fall out verye well at this tyme to serue my turne: for euen now am I to∣ward a wyfe, and I haue stood in great doubt a long tyme with my selfe, whe∣ther were better to chose a bigge boun∣ser, or a litle lowbithgroūd: but by this your speech I fynde now the ende of my doubte. Nowe surely I wil seeke out the least woman that possiblye may bee founde in a cuntrey: and if I may fynde such a one as may serue my turne, and yet skāt able to reach vp to my midle, I wil thinke I haue found the most preti∣ous iewell in the world: for of two euils you say the least is alwayes to bee cho∣sen.
Student. Why frend Nimblechaps me thinks you seeme rather ready to play with ye shadowe of euery thing then wiling to vnderstand the substantiall matter in a∣ny thing: can you rightly gather vpon my speech that a woman is euill? if you do well vnderstande mee, you shal finde nothing lesse, but rather that shee is for the most parte one of the greatest good thinges in this world, and most necessa∣ry of any thing els besydes. Idlenes. Syr in what I spake of a woman I bilt no part of my speech vpon yours I bilt only vpon my owne ground, your speech was but an introduction vnto me: but if it be as you say in your coun∣trey (as for all countryes I am sure, you haue not trauailed) then do your countrey and myne greatlye differ: for where you say, she is one of the greatest
goods in the worlde, there is this olde saying with vs. Femina rara bona, sed si bona digna corona, a woman is sosil∣dome and so rarely good, that when she is good indeede, she is worthy to wear a crowne of gold: and besides, wher you say, she is most necessary of any earthly thing▪ that sowndes something like one way to bee true: for wee haue an other old saying with vs, that drawes verye neere vnto that purpose, which is this that fire, water, and a woman be three of the most necessary euils in world. with many other lyke olde sayinges, which were to long to bring in questiō. Student If al your many, other lyke old, and dūstical sayings be like vnto these two, none of them all would bee worthye the repeting, for of these the one is meerlye false, the other not rightly vnderstoode: for wheras you say, that fire, water, & a woman, be three necessary euils: that is cleane contrary, for they be three of the necessary goods in this world, for ye preseruing and keepinge of mans lyfe,
and besides by common reason it is a thinge very vnceasable, that any euill thing can bee necessarye, it is rather a thing to be thought necessary, that ther were no euill at all: but in way of rea∣soning some wil say, that good beares not his name but in respect of euil, and how should good be knowē if euil were not, and that one cōtrary doth alwayes set forth and shew an other, & therefore necessary with manyother stronger re∣asons then here can bee made, yet they shal be but arguments of deceit, for as black is a colour of it selfe wtout white & white wtout bearinge seueral names for knowledge of the one from ye other, euen so is good a vertue of it selfe with∣out euil, and euil a vyce of it selfe with∣out good. Therfore I haue sayd no euil can any way be necessary and now since a woman by your confessiō is necessary how wil your rusty sentenses make her to be an euil? my friende, you may see howe your olde fayinges (a number of them, by cōtinuance of time be so great¦ly corrupted, as most of thē, (bearing a
show of truth, in that they be olde) are very false. And nowe as to your other sentence, Fem. rar. bon. sed si bon. dig. coron. your interpretation herein is cleane contrary to the true meaninge. For rightly it is thus to be vnderstood A womā is a rare good (that is to say) so rare a good thing, as the like is hard∣ly, or not at al to be found againe in this world, but if good, worthy of a crown of Gold: that is thus to be vnderstoode on the other side, that (since in euerye kynd there be alwayes some which bee euil) if the woman bee good (shee is so necessary) she is thē most worthy to be had in greate estimatiō before all other earthly thinges, and therfore it is sayde shee is worthy to be crowned, and now my thinks tyme growes away very fast I hope we neede not continue any lon∣ger in these your slippes, and wanton bywayes leading cleane from our pur∣pose, you may finde how rashlye you haue bene ready to conceaue amisse: & therfore now once agayne to enter into
your question if you will suffer mee to proceed: as I haue sayd of two euilles the least is to be chosen, and now which is the least euill, to bee ydle or to be yll occupyed, that must bee our question: & for this tyme I thynk myne opiniō wil draw very neere vnto your good liking: For in my conceypt of the twayne, to be ydle is the least euil, and yet I must a∣gree, that ydlenes is the mother of all mischiefe, the roote of all sinne the hād∣mayd of the deuil, and the deuils stael, as the oule is for the byrder vnder his lyme bush or hydden nett. But to way according vnto common reason so long as a man is ydle hys mynd is occupyed about nothing of effect, eyther good or bad, and during that tyme in quality he very much resembleth the Jacke daw, whose nature is beyng the most vnhap∣py and ydle headed byrde that flyes, con∣tinuallye to plucke strawes from some thatcht house or other, snapping at eue∣ry flie which comes in his way, or ram∣ming of euery litle cranny he fyndes wt some baggagely stuffe. For when shall
you see the ydle man: but eyther he is doyng his neighbour, or next stander by some petty mischiefe, catching at flies, playing with strawes vnder his feete, champing them with his teeth, or els busied about some other like ydle occu∣pations: beyng ydle the mynd alwayes runneth wildly about after euery row∣ling glint of the eye, and beinge well markt, it makes the man appeare as if he were mad, and beyng long continu∣ed oft tymes it bringes him to madnes indeede, for then he is a ready host and sit receptacle to entertayne all wicked imaginations, & hath stable romth plen∣ty for the deuil, & as many horss as he wil bring, and whether you think ye de∣uil daunsing vppon horsbacke within a man wil make him mad or no, I leaue it to your iudgement: we may learne by a familiar example of a simile: daylye in experience among vs, that greate incō∣ueniēce doth come by ydlenes For loke vnto those places where greate infecti∣ons of plagues and other lyke diseases do raygne: haue you not continuallye there the aduyce of wyse & learned phi∣sitions,
in any case neuer to goe abroad wt an empty & ydle stomacke (lest infec∣tiō fynding it empty coms in & take his place filling it ful of filthy corruption, & therby bryngeth your body soner to de∣cay: they wish vnto euery man a thinge most easy alwayes ready to bee hadd) a cup of ale & a tost in a morninge, which hath euer bene thought very holesome, & good to kepe the stomacke occupied, though continuall tipling ale knightes in places of misrule do greatly someti∣mes abuse it: yet of it self being mode∣ratly takē it is neuertheles to be allow¦ed, & it is worthy of cōmendation, as ap¦peareth by this old verse following: sa∣nat, confortat, exhilarat nobilis ala, & dat iucundū, nappalis ala viruū. Thus you may s to kepe your body in perfect health, it is ye most necessary thinge ye is required at your handes, to kepe it still from emptines: & euen so is it wt your mynd, if you wil kepe it in good order, admit as seldom as yon cā ye cōpany of ydlenes: for beynge ydle you are like a man yt knoweth a number of mad men
to stand in a place with naked swordes in their handes and yet venters sarke naked among them and so is killed: and woulde you not iudge this wilfull man guilty of his owne death? surely hee is, and although hee cannot liue agayne to this worlde to receaue worldly punish∣mēt, for that his so haynous offence, yet in hell hee is sure to hange, which is a place of punishment euerlasting for all such like obstinate, desperate, and wic∣ked offenders and euen so is it with you when you are ydle, for then you hazard your selfe thus far, you know full well that beyng ydle if the deuil be not with you presently, he wil not long ary frō you: and then if obstinatly you will still continue in ydlenes, and make him a∣way to creepe further and further, into your heade, and so at length to possesse your whole bodye, are not you then as guilty of your owne death as he which kylles hymselfe? if you continue so lōg in ydlenes, til the deuil (creping so clos∣ly as you can neuer perceaue him) be∣gins
to dip in his foot, then surely you are almost past remedye: but you may sometyme perchaunce bee ydle, and et presently fall to some exercise agayne, and then it wil be the lesse hurtful vnto you, so long as no vice hath taken posses∣sion: and now by this means, since ydle∣nes is but a possibility to drawe a man to wicked sin: and the other, which is to be ill occupyed, is a sinne in act already committed, thoughe (as I haue sayd) they be both so naught as neuer to be allowed: yet of the two in myne opini ydlenes is the lesse euil. Idlenes Now truly syr, my goodwil stande vppon thornes, till it hath yeelded d thanks according to your deserued our∣tesye, and were it not for the common proue be which daily is had in remem∣braunce, that tomuch of anye thinge is starke naught, I would doubtles sēd some tyme wherein it should app are, I shoulde not bee myndful of this your
frēdly coūsayle: but knowing your hast vnto other affayres, least I should kepe you to long, I will brieflye proceed ac∣cording to the first cause of my commīg vnto you: and therefore now sir, this is ye other matter, wherin I am to craue your aduise. The liuely and cunninge workman∣ship in the forme and fauoure of a man, so far passeth, and excelleth all carthlye and artificiall skill, as it is not meete to be named in any spech of comparisō, with any earthly or worldly thing: and therfore here I dare but faintly speake therof: yet for experience and learning sake, let me be bould here at this tyme to craue this one thing of you, to single out and chose secretlye vnto your selfe ye most amiable and well fauoured face that possibly may be seene, with the ra∣rest and most cumly parsonage that by any meanes can be found, admitting ye workemanship of nature so perfectly set forth in hī, as not to be reprehēdable, so much as in one title touchīge his forme & beautye, and then (committinge your
external cēses, wt the cumlines & beau∣ty of his outward parsonage to scilēce) conuay yt secret insight of your profoūd iudgement into ye inward partes of the said cumly man, & if there after a while hauing made sufficient serch and view in euery corner, you fynd yt nature hath not so much as vouchsaft one dram of wit in his head, nor so much as on good qualitye in his mynd, I praye you then dissemble not your conceipt in him, but tel me playnly how you woulde esteme of the man. Student Your request is verye reasonable, though somthing hard, yet not so hard as necessary to be vnderstood: I acompt it hard because (though nature beareth ye name) God is the cheefest workman, of this most cunning and skilful peece of worke, which here you haue described. Therfore if sodainly I should geue any rash iudgemēt therin, my such vnaduy∣sed answer would procure ye lesse credit vnto my speech. But to satisfy your re∣quest, my opinion is this: Admittinge
him to be according to your description wel fauored and cumly of personage, if therwith he hath neyther wit, nor anye one commendable or skilful quality be∣sydes, yet you ought not any thinge at all to despyse him: for though he differs perhaps greatly from you in beauty & fauour, and somethinge in comlines of shape (wherin he far excelleth you) and you perhaps differ lykewyse from him as greatl in witt with many skilful & cunning qualityes of the mynd, where∣in on the other side you do as farre passe and goe beyond him. et in truth you be both made of one mould, and he that gaue vnto hym that comely parsonage & shape of man could as wel haue geuē him the vnseemliest shape, and forme of the most vgliest beast in the worlde, frō whō also your great giftes of wisdome and vnderstanding, doth likewyse pro∣cede, whom as wel he could haue made a very natural foole. and therfore to be short, though shauing entred according to your request into the boweiles, and inward partes of this man) I do plain∣ly
se that wisedome & those qualities to be wantige in hym, which do flow in you, and that goodly and cumlye parso∣nage which is in hym, to be lykewyse wanting in you: yet I can no way see a∣ny great difference of estimation which rightly and lawfully cā be had or made betweene you: he is as prfite a man in euery part ether outwardly or inward∣ly▪ to serue that intent and purpose, for the which he was made as you, and you as hee. Idlenes. Sir (not in maner as reprehending you, but with most harty thankes) you haue troubled your self further then my intent was in this motion at the first to haue troubled you, & done more then I durst desire you: my meaning was not to haue craued your iudgemēt and opi∣nion in the dutiful & equal estimation, which euerye man ought to beare one
toward an other, in that wee be al bro∣thers, and as children of one father: but according to the common course of the world (which is, as forreiners & straun∣gers, euerye man to pull out his nexte neighbours throat, for the gayninge to himselfe a halfepenny) how here would you iudge he should be estemed. Student. As for my trouble it hath not bene greate, for your thankes I do as litle looke, and your mynde I do very well now vnderstand, and as for myne opini∣on in him accordig to the cōmon course of the world, it may so fal out, that you & I therin shal mecte both in one mind, for the way is so playne as a blynd man almost may easily keepe ye path I think hee shall bee taken and reputed in this worlde as a gaye and goodlye paynted sheath made at the fyrst for some choyse & special good mettalled kniues which now (by misfortune beyng lost, or rash∣ly cast awaye) is amde full of dyrtye
drosse, and rotten stickes: or otherwyse as a braue and lofty house, erected per∣happes at the first, and mayntayned longe by some famous, wyse, and no∣ble Prelates, and now inhabited, by a most infamous, ignoraunte, and base packe of spendalles. Who certainly be perswaded (bearyng so goodly a house vppon there heads, thoughe they haue litle witte therin besydes: and commō∣ly as litle money in their purses) that they bee all in such generall and great estimation: as they iudge ye very birds of the ayre, which by chaunce light vpō their houses, comes of purpose to yeeld them honor. Wheras of truth, if some liberall spa∣ring wyse mē were in their roumthes, and by chaunce commttinge some such wanton and prodigall ouersight, they would rather think to themselues, that those byrdes came for to accuse them of their vayne and prodigall folly. But contrary to their such most ignoraunte and blynde perswations, the Worlde,
doth altogether disalow and condemne them tough perhaps nere vnto theire such statelye and gallante seats, many knauish dissembling & slattering mar∣chauntes, wil subtelye geue them ma∣ny a cap and legge, more for there meat and drinkes sake, then eyther for loue or feare, which the prodigall man doth sydome see or vnderstand, nor yet doth remember the old prouerbe, no craft to the clouted shoo, which (but by  graue wyse, pollityke, and liberall sparinge mē) neuer was nor euer shal be kept in any good or peaceable order, where one blynde man leadeth an other, they both  commōly into some dyke, wher two or many fooles be, and one of them appoynted to ouersee an other. They ne¦uer seaue scratching or byting. Wher among many ignorants that haue smal vnderstāding, as litle wit, & lesse know∣ldge in any thinge at all, one of them notwithstanding doth alwaies guide, & teach an other, how can they finde, or if as lynd men by chaunce they stumble vppon and finde, how can they keepe ye
right & playn way, vnto what place soe∣uer they seeke: what ioy would therbe (thinke you) among the pore britching boyes, and grammer schole children, if it might be lawfull for one of them to gouerne and teach an other, how ioyful would they be if they might haue more maysters then one or two, or halfe a do∣sen: for then many a waghalter would be in good hope, that when one of his maysters for some offence should goe a∣boute to britch him, some of the o∣thers perhappes for affections sake wil laboure as fast to saue him, wherof be∣ynge deuided, they may fall into some iarre among them selues, and thereby the vnhappy wagg may happily escape a scowring. Truly to be short, I think in euerye thinge, one ignoraunte must needes leade an other ignorantlye, one blynd man doth leade an other blyndly, one foole an other foolishly: pake and put to geather many crafty and subtill men, ther shall be nothing but deuising continually to wrangle, and one to de∣ceaue an other: knitt likewyse to toge∣ather
a knotte of knaues, you shall see nothing but cosenage, quarellig, braw∣ling and fighting. Perhaps you wil say to me, then ioyne wyse men togeather, and they no doubt must nedes very wel agree: but the corruption of this world is such, as I fynd by experiēce (though it be agaynst reason, in that wisdome is so sure and perfect a guide vnto them) that they wil oftentymes, and greatly iarre. But where you wil haue ye wis∣dome and pollecy of man to beare anye sway, place him not to gouerne and cō∣maund his equals, and much lesse his superiours. But whom is hee to com∣maund and rule? let him bee in place of auctority aboue them, and then eyther for feare or loue they wil obay him. Admit the chiefe captayne in a fielde of equal countenaunce, auctority, and rule with manye of his Souldiers, thinke you that they would lēg agree. I think rather that the whole campe by theire continual disagrementes, that I am in as greate auctoritye as thou: and I as thou▪ would very easily and soone be o∣uerthrowen
and therfore according to wisedome and pollicy, one cheefe & head schole mayster in euery schole, doth al∣waies and only bear the greatest sway, though somtime he hath diuers vshers vnder hym: one chief gouerner and ru∣ler in euery field (thoughe with many vnder captaines and petty leaders) and not without great counsayl of wyse and experte men, doth alwayes beare the sword of rule, and euen so in euery like. But wher you would haue ye blinde man wel ledd, let his leader be of per∣fite and sound sight, wher you wil haue the crafty dissemblinge, and subtill man the simple fooles, the veryest knaues, ye common clowted shooes, and all o∣ther sortes what so euer, kept in their dutyfull due, and cumlye good order, I woulde not haue you couple togea∣ther like to like, though the olde say∣ynge may bee hadde in remembraunce. Simile amat simile, for it is most com∣monly proued to be true, that man oftē∣tymes loueth that, which commonly doth him most harme.
But commit them vnder the gouern∣ment and rod of the most grauest, wyse, and pollitick vsshers that possily may be ound. Wherby the more likely you shall keepe them in awe: and thus my friend to finish my answeare vnto your question, as hear you may perceaue, ye great wisedome and graue gouernmēt is not onely needfull and requisite, but very necessary for the mayntenaunce of euery godlye & gorgious house, and as well for the gouernment of a common welth, and that no man (haue he neuer so gallant or braue a seate) is esteemed in this world and common wealth wor∣thy of rule, honor, and dignity, vnlesse hys wysedome and pollicy in good go∣uernment be agreable therunto, euen so is it with your welfauored and par∣sonable man, which accordinge to your discription wanteth both witte and all good quantyes. Idlenes. Sir you haue not now only resolued
me of my question but you haue entred (according to your saying yt we shoulde both meete in a mynde) into the verye same path wherein  my self had deter∣mined to walke before a turn or two: for though my question was of a most wel∣fauored and strayght de man, yet ye cause therof was this owtward gorgi∣ous, & inwarde naked house, which you haue here decribed, wherof intending to vse some speach vppon a sentente of ye most famous and learned ratour M. T Cicero I thought good to be boulde first to creepe (by the sayd simile of the man) into some part of your iudgemēt therin: wherin now with moste hartye thankes you haue verye wel serued my turne Student. If I haue any way pleasured you, I am very glad but whereas it seemeth by your wordes, your intent was to vse some speach, let not anye thinge that I haue sayde, hinder or stay your procee∣ding
for if it be well or any thinge tollerable I wil allow therof: if otherwyse I wil wish it amended. Idlenes, Sir nothing doubting of your friendly acceptaūce and good counsayle: this is the sentence whereupon I first groun∣ded my purpose and intente. M. T. Cicero. Non domo dominus, sed domi∣no domus honoranda est. Idlenes VVho list to build a lofty house, intending there a portly state Had neede lay vvel his vvits in souse, to keepe them fresh vvithin his pate.

Therfore novv let vs (as I say) since tyme of pleasure serues so vvel Goe passe avvay this pleasant day vvith him that beares avvay the bell. Student. Oh friend I sigh to heare your vayne, and hovv this vvanton vvorld is bent To bring a virtue in disdayne, vvhich is vvhen vvealth is vvisely spent. For then it ought to be of right,
accompted liberality VVhen othervvise in vvisedomes sigh it is but prodigality, If this vvhich you haue sayd be true as seemes experience hath you taught VVisdome might make your hart to ru that you so oft such vice haue sought. Idlenes, VVhy syr, say you thus of to this, as though it vvere a payne to heare Young men delight in fantasies vvith honest mirth and daynty cheare. Student. I truely it is thought a payne to all vvile en that euer vvrote That heads so young should beat their brain to stroy such as they spye to doe: For vvisdome vvarneth vs to reach the ignorantes hovv to auoyde Destruction, yea vvracke, or breach epying them thervvith annoyde And not to trippe the blynd man dovvne,
vvith ioy to see him umbling there For so you may deserue the crovvne of knauery vvhich many vveare, The vvhich I vvould be loth to see my frend should vveare atoken playne Of foly fyxt in him to bee. vvhich vvith the vvise bread great disdayne But since vve be all vvell agreed to passe sometime in pleasant cheare VVe vvil not seeme to hunt for neede nor yet to buy our sport so deare That vvith returne our friendes shall see our credits are so crackt vvith shame As some svveete syrupe suckers be. for then of right deserue vve blame. Such vvanton steppes vvevvil not tread▪ as to allure our friendes to charge. Since captayne Vanity such doth leade, as loue to cloy their friends at large For by such oyes as you haue namd, it is vvell knovvne that many men Of much greate vvealth haue bene so lamde, as novv to begging they must leane.
VVho therfore vvill be partener. vvith such vayne vvanoring heads at all, Must thinke himselfe the vvoithier to beare such blame as doth befall. But if you vvill take my aduyse, vvith such delightes as I thinke good VVe vvill not chuse our fae so nise, nor yet such Oste of vvanton mood. The auntiēt house vve all knovv vvel, vvhich shoring standes vppon the hill, VVhere such vvere euer vvont to dvvel, as alvvayes had their vvit at vvill: They euer tooke delite to leane vnto the saying of the vvise, That measure is a meary meane and please al men of honest guise, VVhich hath them taught to guide so right, that house in hospitality, As come or goe by day or night. they vvil not feed your iolity But for all plenty of good fare, no place to bountye more is bent, You shall not there fynd dishes bare

And can your vvhes so vvind at vvill, as to be fitt at each rebound. To mayne vvith some prety skill the balle of vvit vvhich tost is round. For there you shal not only haue your hunger fed vvith holesome cheare▪ But you shal fynd delight to craue such pleasures oft to see and heare. It is not like your gluttons fare vvhich happily lasteth for a yeare For here a vvise man rules vvith care, and scrapes avvay all folly cleare. Therfore since novv vve be so light as apors, vvhich the sunne dravves vp To be alluerd by vveather bright, let vs first drinke of follyes cup.
And then if all agree thereto this ydle tyme to passe avvay, As marchpaind mouthed vvantons do vve vvil soone spend this pleasaunt day And thus vvee see in euery place most men to this haue greate desire. VVith vvho shall shovv the lustiest face in costly, fyne, and braue attire, VVhich yeeldes them honor as they thinke, in places vvhere they be not knovvne▪ And so from place to place they slinke. and vveares perhaps more then their ovvne VVherby such thankles gluttons feede themselues ful oft in many a place VVhere many such as haue more neede dare not for shame once shevv their face. For he that vveares not cloth of gould vvith atten, veluet, or such like Must not among such gay be bould, as though he should his mates there seeke VVhen he perhaps that vveares his cote most playne i oft the better man, VVhich vvise men alvvayes vvel do note: and yet mend none do vvhat they can.
But such as pedlers packes do bear if they by vvealth aduaunced be He that should spy them fitting there, and tell them of this fond decree.

And yet to end I do admit the meanest man deserue may vvell Among the best sometyme to sit if vvealth be vvonne by great trauell. Or els by virtue of learning vvhich doth the meanest man of all (As our experience dayly bring) to honor high most easely call. VVherto vvhen they aduaunced be, by force of virtues paynful trade. They vvel deserue in their degree such honor as by lavves are made And yet from vvhence the vines do spring of all virtues that euer vvere, As in the scholes of deepe learning, ea reasōs svvarme, vvho best should bea

And he vvhose vvits most vvisely vvrest nobility longest to preserue, Must best be thought among the rest of right his honor to deserue. Idlenes SIr, you haue nowe bound me by dutye to gieue you most hartye thankes that thus friēdly you haue bene contente (for this short time) to banish your selfe frō your so earnest, graue, and profound studye, to accom∣pany me with your friendly conceipt in thse my dayne and ydle inuentions. And therfore now lest I should so long here at this tyme keepe you walkinge
with mee in this my path of vanity, as hereafter when wee shall haue like oc∣cation to trouble you in crauinge your cōpany agayne, you shall be vnwilling to graunte the spendinge of any time (which is ye most precious ewell in the whole world) with such an endles bu∣sye, and ydle runninge brayne: I leaue heare at this tyme to trouble you any further, commending you vnto God, & to your seate and chayre of studye from whence you came. Student Friend Idlenes, though perhaps I am not so curious or coy in spending of my tyme for good felowship and com∣pany sake, as you suppose and think me to be: yet I may not any waye blame you, but rather do very well allow of this your such ready conceipte, & reaso∣nable speech, wherin you seeme not on∣ly vnwilling greatly to assure or intise me vnto any folly: But also as loth, long to hould or kepe mee in anye path
of ydlenes or vanity. For true it is, that notwithstāding most willingly hether∣to, I haue concented to bestowe both tyme and speech accordinge to your re∣quest: yet as true it is, I would be ve∣ry loth to consume or spende any longe tyme in such friuolous and vayne deui∣ses. Thoughe for the companye of my frend I can somtyme be cōtent to wade wt him in some smoth, cleare & shallow flash of folly: yet I confesse I would be very loth to aduenture so far with him as to swim in any rongh, darke, or bot∣tomles pit or puddle of wicked & fylthe vice. I would bee loth with a kinge to drowne in follye, though with my me∣anest frend (as I haue sayd) I can bee content to wade therein: willinglye I would not (if I could otherwyse chuse) goe to farre in any thing. But bearing alwayes in mynde the warninge of a wyse manne to leaue the Racke, and Maunger, and to take a snatch and a∣waye, with small hyndraunce vnto any of my wayghty affayres. I can at anye
tyme in anye honest and cumlye toye of delighte or pleasure, recreate my selfe and accompany my frend. But now as seemes vnto mee, per∣happes you haue an ydle and wanton turne or two secretly to walke by your selfe, wherein you would not haue mee willingly behold your gesture: & there∣fore cunningly crauinge the riddaunce of my companye (as though for feare of offence) you commēd me to my chayre, whereunto beyng verye well content to graunt you your such secrete, and cun∣ning request, I am as willing to goe, and in likemanner as you commended me vnto God, I also in the same friend∣ly manner, commend you not vnto him but to your owne inuention. Wishinge you to remember your owne coun∣sayle now in your selfe, & not to walke to long in any your pathes of vanity. Yet I doubte verye much (friende I∣dlenes) to disswade you frō vanity, for it wil most certaynly perswade a great number to accuse mee of vayne follye,
and perhaps I may so deeply incurre  displeasure of so many as durynge lyfe euer after, (turne which way I will) the blame of my such folly▪ shall stil con∣tinually be blowen in my face: for set∣ting curiosity asyde, to be playne, when your thicke, and bushye beel heade (in shape much like to a hedge hogge halfe vnclosing himselfe, and shewinge his bare and naked face) lieth rowled vnder an aperne, and tumbling in your sweete harts and wantōs la, busying the wabling belclarppe of your so vayn and ydle body, so greatlye to her good lyking and pleasure euery wa, as shee seemeth not onely loth to leaue your company, but rather longing stil to cō∣tinue her such pastyme, in playing with the soft and gentle prickes of that your rowlinge and ydle pate, and sometyme perhaps at your oft request and flatte∣ring intisement: yeelding wt her smoth and tender lips to honor your hard and bruselled mouth. If then (this merry gale of wynde, this sturring betwixte you, cuppling your ships to gether, and
sayling outward in your voiage of de∣lighte) you bluntly by chaunce shoulde boulte cute this my friendly perswasiō (though secretely vouchsafed vpō you) moning my speach the cause of your de∣parture, vnto that your louing & wan∣ton mouse, and in the middest of al your pleasure offer so to departe, then shall my secret, (though vndeserued) & pin∣ching paynes begin, then shall I be so toste from tounge to tounge, frō mouth to mouth, from place to place, and so sharply and shrewishly shakē vp amōg so many, as doubtles it were a thousād tymes better for any man, in the like pitiful case a mong them (though not as a dogge) to be tost in a blanket: they will say, let olde grayberde keepe his counsayle to himselfe. We will craue at his hands, his graue aduise, whē we thinke good: because now by continu∣ance of tyme, he is become frō a clarke to a parrish priest, could he now be cō∣tent to haue no clarkes at all? could hee now fynd in his hart to be reader, sin∣ger and belringer, and al in his parish
alone, surelye it were not amisse if hee were wel applyed, and kept to his tac∣kle but one moneth, and then no doubt wee shall see him come creeping lasisy home with weary limnies: and then yf any man wil offer to take a rope out of his hand, you shal see hee will be as re∣ady & as willing to let it goe as euer he was in his life to take it vp: then short∣ly after, you shall heare he wil as open∣ly publish it, to be a deede of charitye to helpe the weake and surcharged mā, as he hath alreadye secretly whispered in disalowing the wanton seruice of the stronge and youthful bodyes, and then will confesse that a helping hand is e∣uer to be blamed, & espetially in those thinges which must needes be done. Therfore waying wel the vanity of his speech, let vs not so easilye parte, as to breake of all good company for a white hayre. Frend Idlenes I know this wil be their saying: & besydes this, I know you haue many hāgers on, very diligēt & daily studients, desirous to immitate you in this your ydle art, and to learne
your cunning slayghtes in rockinge in Venus lappe, prickinge in, and pick∣lyng out sometymes pinhes out of her picase, thrumming of apern strings & with many other ydle deuises: and ther fore friend iniury, since in disswadinge you accordinge to my former speech, I shal seeme toper swade many a thousād from that which they wil be verye loth to leaue, and in so vaynly wastinge my wynde shall appeare as much an ydle packe as the best, I recante my former perswasion, and thus do commend you only heare vnto your naturall, vayne, & ydle inuentions. Idlenes. Sir you seeme so gamesome & plea∣saunt in this your reply vppon my late and friendly farewell, as I thinke you could be cōtent to remainestil wt me, ba∣thing your selfe in this my lasye tub (as you terme it) and vessel of ydle vanity: therfore know this I am not so inclind vnto yt vice of ingratitude, I haue bene so
vnciuisly or so vnmannerly brought vp▪ that when any man friendly vpon good wil, as though desyrous of my compa∣ny, shal come vnto me, that then after  whyle eyther by secret speeches or cu∣ning gestures, I wil seeme so weary of him, as rather desyrous of his routh then of himselfe, for truly it is nothing agreable eyther vnto my nature or to my bringing vp and much lesse, when I my selfe shall be first desirous of his company. But I must confesse you are blameles, though you did mistake me, for you cannot be so well acquaynted wt my nature and meanīg in any thing: as I am with the naturall disposition of you, and of all ye world besides. I agree well with you, if I were according to the common nature and disposition of men, beyng in company wt my friendes and familiars, I woulde sometymes wish, and perhappes willinglye caue rather their roumth then their compa∣ny. For admitting I weee as other mē bee, and as you your self in your youth∣full dayes heretofore haue bene: then
perhaps and not vnlike but it might be with me as it hath bene with you & ma∣ny others, that some famous learned, & skilfull Astronomer, hath latelye bene with me, and by his or her misticall and wonderfull straunge knowledge, hath geuen me certaynly to vnderstand, that such a tyme, day and hower, and in such a place there shal without fayle appear vnto me very secretly a glorious, braue and goodly blasing starre: and that the place where it shal appeare, must needs be free, and cleere of al company, other∣wise it will shew it selfe but as a playne and common star, without any blasing or stemming at all. Perhappes I haue appoynted secretlye to see some tum∣bling cast, with some pleasant and me∣ry slayghtes of iugling trickes, and to draw more nerer vnto natural & playne vnderstāding, not vnlike but I haue ap∣poynted to kis some pretye wench in a corner: and now admittyng al this to be true (as in many men it is daily seene, would any of my friendes, or acquayn∣tance blame me, to shew thē cunningly
some colour of desire to craue for a time rather their roumth then their compa∣ny, I thinke none. There is also an o∣ther kynd of people, which do likewise and very often cunningly craue the rid∣daunce of company, which be in ye En∣glish frase, the cormugions and coue∣tous carles of this worlde, their natu∣ral disposition is, fyrst to scramble and scratch togeather if he cā a liuing equal with the best yeman, gentleman, or squyre in his countrey, then stryuing to shroude himselfe vnder some ragged & little cottage, to serue no further then onely for necessity, or if a large or fayre house, then keeping his dores continu∣ally shut as though neuer at home, con∣tenting hymselse willinglye, and all his houshold perforce with a sparinge and pinching dyet, doth chiefly feede and al¦togeather delight himselfe wt the oft tel¦ling and cōtinual sight of his money, as young men commonly do themselues, in the sight of their louers. And now ad¦mit some young heads and merye com∣panions knowing his abilitye & vnder∣stāding
his miserable & beggerly mind husying their brayns cūningly to work him som slayghty, prety, & slipry trick, doe agree among thēselues vpon some high & festiual day, knowing yt thē per∣haps he hath a peece of biefe, a calues ad or an oxe foote in ye pot, & do apoint  meeting of many neighbours ye verye same tyme to dyne with him, bidden by a messenger in very good & due order, as though very sollomly biddē by him: then dinner time drawing nere, seruice beyng done, & euery man departinge to his house, this pore, miserable & wret∣ched miser doth sit stil in his seate fea∣ring greatly that if sodaynly he should thronge or presse out among the thick∣est, some or other would so cūingly mi∣nister such occation of talke with him, as eyther to shame him or els to inforce him home to dinner, but after a whyle looking oftentymes backward ouer his shoulder, and spying some stil remay∣nig behynd, not musing a litle at ye mea¦nig therof, at lēgth rise th vp, & pulling his cap in his eyes, passeth away by thē
sneaking, as though he had nothinge to say or meddle with any of them all: but then euerye man rysinge vp▪ with him, greatly to his admiratiō, and honoring him with cap and legge, accepting that hys gesture as a stately and graue be∣hauiour in him. Some of them acco∣pany him check by cheek with friendy commendation, and great thankes for his vnwonted and friendly curtesy: and the rest following after hard vppon his heeles, playnly to his sight intendinge to accompany him home to dynner, as they thinke like bidden and welcome guestes, but as he thinkes like malla∣pet impudent, and sausy marchaunts: if now it were possible to beholde euen at this instant, with our outward eyes, the strange thoughts and ymaginatiōs of this pore, distressed, and miserable miser. I think the meriest company of stage players, that might be founde in a coūtrey, would hardly make more sport then he him selfe would do alone: for to see how glummishly hee glyeth aside, like a bere at a sake, and how manye
stoppes and turnes he makes before he comes home, and how priuily he bāneth them, wishing the Deuill and his dam to choke them all, the sight thereof no doubt, if it were possible one horse face might laugh at an other, woulde make any horse in the world to break his hal∣ter, I can but wish that I hadde eyther Apelles or Zeuxes skil, in the science of paynting and that I could as perfectly paynt him, with his countenaunce ac∣cording to my imagination, as Zeuxes paynted his grapes, or as Apelles his sheete, which were so cunninglye done on both partes, as euer since to bee had in great estimation, but neuer to bee paternd: the one of them Zeuxes, (as our bookes do report) amonge many o∣ther of his notable workes, paynted (as before named) a naked boy with a būch of grapes as though growing vpon his shoulders, which were so perfite to the outward sight, as the very byrdes of the ayre, came and lited vppon the boyes shoulder & continually picked vpon the grapes, and though they found no sa:
yet as appeared by their oft resort, they could not be perswaded, but ye grapes they must needes bee, and in that they could neuer pick out any iuice, they see∣med rather to impute it to ye bluntnes of the bylles, then to the drynesse of the grapes: for they went continually to a stone which was fast by, and alwayes whet their bylles and so still continued their resort vntil it was taken awaye. The other paynter Apelles hearing of this excellent peece of worke, destred Zeuxes that a day might be appoynted of meetinge betwixte them two before some gentlemen of their friendes & ac∣quaintāce, and to passe away somtyme, and to delight the sight of their friends desyred him to bringe of his workes, what he thought good, & that he would do the like, wherunto Zeuxes agreyng at ye day appoynted among many other wonderful, straūge, and notable works he brought this naked boy wt ye grapes vppon his shoulders, Apelles amonge diuers other lyke wyse very cuning and skilful works, brought a table couered
with a white sheete, & then in viewing euery man the others workes, Apelle greatly commended ye perfit colour and forme of the grapes, & nothing disalow∣ing of al the rest: & then Zeuxes cōmen∣dinge likewise (no otherwyse then iust cause doth require) the perit workmā∣ship in each point of Apelles, desired af¦ter all yt he would take away the white sheete which couered his table, for hee would be glad if he might to see all, thē Apelles smiling to hymself sayd, friend Zeuxes, since you are so desirous, I wil not be so ingrateful as to deny you: yet my meanīg was whē I first brought it not euer to vncouer it, because I founde some fault with my selfe therin, & ther∣fore was the more loth to show my fault vnto straungers: but since you haue don all this at my request, I wil not herein denye you yours: therfore euen at your pleasure goe and take it of your self, for I will bee loth to condempne my selfe, I hadd rather an other manne shoulde condempne me. Then saide Zeuxes, na friende Apelles, if so bee yt you doubte
any discredite therby. I will not desire it for any money. But Apelles answea∣ringe: I force not for the discredite a∣mong my frendes: take it of and spare not. Then Zeuxes drawing nere vnto it as one with chyld, til he had seene what was vnder, layd both his handes vppon it at both sides, catchinge to take holde of the sheete, and suddaynly finding it to be but a paynted colour and no sheete in truth turnde him aboute agayne, with great admiration, & sayd among thē al, that wheras Zeuxes had cūningly (as the world thought) deceiued the birds. Apelles hath here more cūningly decei¦ued Zeuxes, for where as in truth I thought to haue takē of a shete, I haue but scratchte at a paynted coloure of white: & thus with many other pleasant and prety conceiptes Apelles at yt time bare away the bell. And now if I had lyke skil vnto eyther of these, whether thinke you that my tme spent in payn∣ting of this man would be lost or no. But it is wel knowen (the more is the pitye for this man) I am neither A∣pelles
nor Zeuxes, but playne ydlenes. And therfore nothinge meete to paynte him out so orderly as the natural shape and countenaunce of the manne doth re∣quire. But leauing the pleasant show vnto the cunning paynter, & admitting this to be true (as I thinke it hath bene put in vse) could you or any man els blame this sylly miserable, & wretched mucke∣munger or the world to be rather desy∣rous of the roumth thē of the company of these secret inuited & bidden guestes: surely for my part I thinke you cannot but rather you must holde him excu∣sed. Therfore syr, to conclude this my lōg and tedious speech perhaps vnto you. If I were (as I haue sayde before) a∣greeable with the common course and nature of men, you might wel haue ga∣thered by my speech, that I was desy∣rous of your roumth and cleanlye ryd∣daunce. But myne estate & callinge is such, as no company, be it euer so great can impouerish me, or diminish or take
away any delite from me at all. For the more cōpanye, the greater is my riches and delite if they wil contēt themselues with mee and any dyet: I am none of Shamfastes children, I blush not who¦soeuer lookes vppon mee. And therfore thinke not that I did commend you vn∣to your study, because I was desirous (as you tooke it) to daunce a turne or two priuily or wantonly alone. For since you seeme so willinge and contente with my company, with al my harte, I will make you partaker in all the reste of my causes, which at this tyme I intende to bringe in question, & besydes, rather then you shal thinke me (as you haue thought) weary of your company. If you wil accept of this my arte and symple skyll. I came and will afford you, for euery hower in the day, for euery day in the yere, and for euery yeare durynge your lyfe, seueral que∣stions, with many pretye conceiptes at all tymes to busy and occupye your selfe withall: as presentlye shall appeare, yf you will vouchsafe vnto mee your
friendly audience. Student Friend Idlenes, you say, and true it is, that you are acquaynted with ye na∣ture and disposition of all estates, far better then I am, or euer shal be able to conceiue, and that by reason of your lōg experience and continual company with all men: then must I needes now think and certaynly perswade my selfe, that you are not now vnacquaynted, nor to learne the qualityes of a knaue. There is an old saying and oftentymes founde to be true. ni, fa, pa, con: admitte you were a teacher of the common people, or a scholemayster ouer manye children as no doubt somtime you are, beyng a great medler, and busye bodye in any thing, & dayly intruding your selfe into euery vocation, & calling from ye high∣est to the lowest whatsoeuer, as a most ydle & mery cōpanion: staring as bold∣lye vppon a Kinge as you doe vppon the meanest & playnest begger: if a man
may aske you a questiō: how would you open vnto the common people, or howe would you teach your younge schollers to vnderstand the meaninge of these 4. wordes, ni, fa, pa, con. Idlenes Sir I am no more nice in aunswea∣ring then I am in putting forth. But to tell you the truth (which I thinke you do already know) it pertaynes nothing at all vnto mee to be a teacher, though sometymes I confesse I am in compa∣ny with manye wyse and learned men. for where I acompany most, there they learne and teach least: & litle or nothing tendinge to goodnes, is euerbrought in question, vnlesse it be at a verye greate chaunce: and then also am I fayne to de∣part as one whose companye is so little esteemed, as though nothing necessary at all, & yet the meaninge of this shorte sentence, me thinkes I shoulde easilye vnderstande, and the rather because I haue hard it oft. I think (to be short) it
is as much to say: as, Nimia familiari∣tas parit contemptū. And by this may a scholler easily vnderstād the meaning and for the instruction of the common people, it is as much to say, as tomuch familiarity breedeth contempt. Student. Friend Idlenes I see you are not al∣togeather an ignoraunte, thoughe you confesse your selfe neuer to bee in com∣pany wher any godnes is taught: as it seemeth knowledge comes to you by in¦spiration, but wherof I know not: you haue hit the right way of play instru∣ction to a Scholler: but as to the com∣mon people, you haue left it as raw as you found it, though you haue spoken it in English, for the ignoraunt & commō people do as wel vnderstand English, for the most parte, as they vnderstande greeke: though somtime vnderstandīg nothing they verily thinke they vnder∣stand all: and vnderstanding as much as a block, they thinke the greatest doctor
in the world can hardly amēd them, yet they will saye, is it not english? and am not I an English man? why then I pray you may not I vnderstād it? but it may be aunsweared, are ther not many En∣glish men ignorauntes? yes, why may not you then be an English ignorante, but there is an old prouerbe, ignorance is an enemy to knowlege, it is common¦ly seeme, an ignorant man wil alwaies fynd faults and dissalow of those things wherein hee hath no skill, and fyndes a fault where no fault is to be found, and especially when impudency is ioynd vn∣to his ignorance: for then he will profes him self before eyther his prince or any wyse or learned counsaile, thinking his owne wit (when he is a very foole) to be best of al? but as ye old saying is: who is so bould as blynd bayarde? who thinks he knowes more then hee that knowes nothing at al: for the wise & learned wil say, hoc solum scio quod nihil scio. I only know this yt I know nothīg at al. And the foole sayth, what know not I? whereuppon the wise man sayth with
the Phisition it is time for wise men to hold there peace, when euery foole will be a Phisition. And therfore my friend to make this plain English more plain as wel vnto you as to the common peo∣ple: whereas you say, to much familiari¦ty breedeth contempt: this is yet as I haue said hard lattine vnto ye cōmon peo¦ple, for it is impossible euer to be to fa∣miliar wt a wise & honest mā, how ther∣fore now can this sentence seemetrue in al, since it can not be sometyme to much it can not alwaies breed contempt: and therefore though the sentence of it selfe be true, yet to ye cōmō vnderstāding you haue opened it to darkly. ye plain english is this: to much familiarity bredeth cō∣tēpt, yt is, to be checkmate at any time, & haile fellowe to much wt a knaue or a foole, and no doubt hee wil take therby such impudēt courage, as after a while you shal fynde to bee most true, that he will not greatlye sticke in anye compa∣nye what soeuer, to spyt in your mouth when you passe the Streetes talkinge
with your frend, he wil not be ashamed to come and colle you about the neck, if you chaunce in frendly manner to geue him but one friendlye worde, or merye looke, you shal not fayle of a thousande agayne, with many a counterfet wrong shapen & croked countenaunce if so cur∣teously sometime by chaunce you enter∣tayne him as to set him at your borde, you shall fynd him somtime in your lap when you would wish him further of: if at any tyme for your pleasures sake, you wil vouchsafe to talke with him in the presence of his betters. Afterwad perhappes when you shall be reasoning with your friend, hee wil be ready with his sausy toung to haue a choppe at e∣uery word that shal proceed from your mouth, and thinks it a glory vnto him if he be a meane man, your inferiour a knaue or a foole, that he may so boldlye chop logicke with one that is so farre aboue him, and his better, And what is the cōmon speach some∣tyme of the veriest knaue in a country? will not he say, (being alwayes in quar¦rell
and continuall ar with his neigh∣bours, geuing them oft tymes his own name) the proudest aue of you al shal offer mee no wronge, I can goe to my Lorde and to my adye, and to the best gentleman in the shire early or late, to dinner or to supper, or at any tyme whē soeuer I Iust, I can speak as boldly vn∣to thē as I can vnto my faltar friend & brother, when a thousand such drum∣medaries and playne knaues, as you be, must stand at ye dore, or if you chāce to come in, then with cap in hand, and many a low curtesie. And therfore you playne knaues of ye countrey: how dae you abuse me (he might say) the capi∣tal and captayne knaue of the worlde: & how can the pore countrey mā answear him since oftentymes they fynd and see these his sayings to be true. They haue nothing u the world to say, but when ye knaue is out of sight, then to whisper a∣monge themselues, and say, the more knaue ye better luck: it we could as cun∣ningly play ye knaues, as he, we should eate sometyme veneson, and haue other
good theere among the best, as wel as hee: but since our bringing vp hath not bene to beare cunninglye two faces in one hood: or like the subtill woulfe, to goe wrapt in a lambes skinne, or like a crafty and flatteryng knaue to keepe continuall company among gentlemen in auctoritye and rule, as though hee were the honest est man in the worlde: wee must content our selfe as many ho∣nest poore men do, to put vp, daylye in∣iurye and wronge at manye an arrant knaues hande. The crafty knaue doth continually picke out more friendship with his Tounge then the simple man euer could with his inforced and lamen table teares. Yet we must needes agre that teares at all tymes are not to bee pitied, for often tymes in a man they be token greate dissemblinge, vnlesse his cause bee the greater, and to a womā some will say they be natural, and take away her teares, take away her lyfe: & therfore the lesse to be blamed, though sometyme she weepes for euery tryfle: for wee see by experience that she wil
wepe & laugh, and both with one mynd oftentymes very hartely, and that most cōmonly wtout any disgrace to her cre∣dite or fauour at all: it shewes playnly that she wil sone be angry & soone plea∣sed, and therin she kepes stil ye nature of the soft and gentle child, & he yt offers a child wronge, hath but small witt and discretion: it hath sildome bene seene, yt mallice coulde neuer rust in a womans hart: where it continually ebs & slowes there remayneth litle corruption ye con∣tinuall runninge riuers we see alwaies most cleere at the bottom, & the stāding puddles continually ful of ilth: cast as much grauel & stones into ye one as you can, and shortly after with one flow you shall see it as clean at the bottom as it was before: cast as much and as litle as you wil into the other, if you come 7. yeare after you shal fynd it stil at ye bot∣tom. this stāding puddle we se is neuer cleane, but once in 7 year it hardly esca∣pes vnfyde, either wt a muckrom or wt a swords poynt. The other we see it so cōtinually cleer, as it needes not to bee side.
in the one we see duckes and geese con∣tinually swilling and bibling for todes▪ in the other we see fisher mē with their siluer hookes continually anglinge for fish, with greate pastime and pleasure, the one is for the hogge to wallow in & sometyme for the Oxe and the Cow to drink in, yt other for gentlemen to hake at, & sometymes perhappes to watter their nagges in: & thus if your eye sight be any thing clear, you may plainly see that teares at a womans eye, be tokens in her a myld and gentle hart, cleare at the bottom from all enuye and malice, though sometymes perhappes at ye first it beginnes of a curst and a shrewish sto∣make, as for disgrace which sometimes it bringes vnto the fauour of her face, it is with women as it is with men: it is a comly sight in some man to looke a loft like a lyō, in some other it is a thing very vnseemly. Speech and continuall talking, be∣cōmeth some men very wel: few words or rather continuall silence, becom∣meth an other man as well, it is a good
sight to see some men in costly and gor∣gious apparel, according to the vanity of the tyme, to see other some it is as good a sight as to see a curre dogge in a satten dublet: for a prety spaniell it is a great deale better. Is it not a good & commendable sight to behold some mā in his side gowne and white sirples, and euery way besides in the best and most cōly attyre which pertaineth to a graue and diuine minister? Doth not a shorte coat a payre of hye buckled shooes, and a capp with a butten on the crowne, be∣come an other man as well in his voca∣tion (as the countrey husband man) is it not as good a sight to see an egregi∣ous offender, and a common breaker of the Princes lawes punished accordinge to his offence, as it is to see the obediēt and true subiect, continuallye cherished and made of? to be short, what soeuer is thought cumly for an honest man, is neuer thought meete for a knaue, and though somtime he puts it on it makes hym appeare but a counterfet. Put a beluet coate vppon a knowen naturall,
and common foole, is he not more to be laught at then if hee were in his pyde cot: bringe an egregious and knowne knaue in place to play the part of an ho∣nest man, were it not a thing rather to be laught at then commended? vnlesse he ment neuer to reuert agayne, which is ildeme seene? in the behauioure of man, there be manye iestes, and expe∣rience teacheth vs that euery one of thē becomes not euery man alyke. But al∣wayes according to the natural dispoti¦tion and bringing vp of the man, they yee de their comly and vncomely grace in him, euen so is it (to come vnto my purpose) as I haue sayd amonge ye wo∣men: for that which doth verye well set forth & become one woman, doth as greatlye disgrace & disuiger an other. but there a straw: in that I know (as I haue sayd, women be soone angerd, and then without a sodaine ebbe, theirharts wil sone sinck in sorrow, therfore I wil not meddle to far with them. yet thus much I hope I may boldlye say wt the philosopler, who spake more in cōmen∣dation
of the teares of a woman (beyng rightly wayed) then I wil at this tyme vtter, yt a teare at som womās eye doth yeelde far more beautifull and comelye grace vnto the fauour of her, then the fayrest and best dyamond that may bee found doth vnto ye pretiest ring, or most pretious iewel in the worlde: and ther∣vpon that philosopher said, that a teare in many a womans eye is a pearle in a mans. But leauing the Philosopher wt all his skill, they neuer proceede harte∣ly from them (I think surely) with out som great cause of vnkindnes or greefe. But as is said, wt men no doubt, for the most part it is taken for dissemblinge, & yet oftē we see, they are inforced therto by naturethough it cā not excuse them. But frend Idlenes, this leads vs with the Lapwing cleane from our matter, touching ye behauiour of a knaue, & the construction of my late demaunde, and whereunto I haue replyed according to your answer, as I haue thought good: for I haue shewed you a more playner Construction of the sentence whiche
I putte forth vnto you, then you in my iudgement did make at the first & ther∣fore now what think you of my construc¦tion made thereof. Idlenes. Sir to geue vp shortly myne opinion (being very loth o hinder or interrupt your purpose in any spech at this time) to my knowlege, you haue opened no more thē is true: but whether you haue declared al ye truth therof or no I know not. Student No friende Idlenes I meane not to beate my braynes to open all yt is true, for if I could do so I might fill a house or rather a whole coūtry ful of books, which were vnfit for anye ydle bodye to take in hand. But admittinge (as you haue graunted) that all I haue sayd is true, I haue sufficiently obtayned my desire, for then I hope as you in youre
first question propoūded vnto me, crept into my iudgement, by a simile, & ther∣by (as you sayd) gathered myne opiniō in a further matter which serued your turne: euen so now haue I as well ser∣ued mine, in that you haue confessed my construction of the sentence put forth vnto you, to be true in euery poynt: for now I thinke you wil easily see & soone confesse your owne fault. Therfore frend iniury cal your wits togeather, and remēber wel your selfe when you first tooke occasion to presse your selfe into my companye, desirous as you seemed verye friendlye to craue sometime of cōference with me, finding your speech and behauiour so agreable vnto my good lyking, I was content to entertayne & admit you into my society and companye, as heretofore hath ap∣peared, and to allow of your familiar & boulde speech, as if you had bene my chiefe companion and mate: & now you vaūt of your victory, that you haue won me to lye bathinge my selfe with you in your lasy and ydle tubbe with your al∣lurīg
sweete water of vanity. And now as though I would not wish ye spēding of one hower willinglye without your company: you offer your selfe to hange about my necke, as though you were with mee hayle fellowe wel met. But frend ydlenes, when I first entertained you (I finde now as a boulde geast) I ment nothīg lesse, nor yet do I mind, to wrap you (as gentlemē & gentlewomē o their ribonds & chaynes) aboute my neck. I would be loth to be sene caryīg you (as begers do their childerē) vpon my back: therfore since vpon thys small familiarity vouchsafed vpō you (as one of shameles childrē) you begin to creep vpō my backe, no doubt you wil shortly fulfil my former speach, to spit into my mouth. But friend ydlenes, neither my neck nor my mouth be any fit places for you, I haue otherwayse to imploy thē: & now setting partiality aside, be your owne iudge whether the old saying, to much familiarity breedeth cōtempt, be here found true in you or no: and when you know your selfe to bee the vaynest
member in the word, then stryue not to dallye any further with me in defēding or answearing of any thing, for I mynd no longer to trouble my selfe, nor to spend any more tyme in hearynge your ydle deuyses: therfore wher as you say, you can feed me with ydle questions e∣uery hower in the day, euery day in the yeare, and euery yeare duryng my lyfe, if I wil but graūt you audience: I wish you rather to bestow them and your selfe also wher you list: and thus in stid of audiēce I grant you here my roūth. It hath bene an old sainge, many geese many birdes, many womē many words: but you haue idle talk plēty for a whole countrey, both of mē & womē, therefore sone as to late, I yeeld vnto you ye game betimes. Idlenes. If I shoulde thus bee lefte at euerye hand, I might wel then go and seeke a companion in the Skyes. But this is nothinge straunge vnto mee, for I am
oftētimes thus banished and sent away & yet after a while presently sometime and priuily intertayned agayn. But since now for a tyme I am very lyke to be left here all alone, I wil im∣ploy my self according to the ydlenes of the place. Idlenes Primus iucūdus tolle-RANDVS, ATQVE secundus tertius est vanus: sed fetat quatridi∣anus. Primus.

Disorder marreth euery thinge so doth misvvearyng of your ringe, Cost is comly vvher order is good order therfore should not misse And such as vveare them as they ought the vvorthier then shall they be thought But some men thinke and so do I that natures flesh vvhen it is bare, VVithout such pearles or paultery if fayre, is fittest for the glare.

VVhat castle, tovver, or strongest hold yeelds not in vievv of princely force, And stoupes vvith crackes as vveake & ould to geue him vvay to take his course. And graunt him, though a countrey small of trusty strong and faythful hartes He neuer feares as once to fal, though all the vvorld besides take parts

VVhere liberall Artes do all take roote from thence Phifitions most do spring A trade vvhich if they vvin, doth booe them greatly all, much vveath to bringe He vholly lyeues vpon his art, VVh  all his age He hath no  mart assvvage.

He spareno king for all his strength, nor any man for pollicy Nor VVoman for beauty at the length but calles in time them all to dye. Therfore my haruest tyme sayth he, doth neuer cease some vvhere to fall But ype, or rotten as you be, my cyth in fyne cleare sheeres dovvne all▪ Youthful age. But youthful age, thus death doe blame, And shootes this boult vvith vvanton aime, That vvere I Death or Death could be

If Death did manlike deale his dole, he could not shevv that cruelty To hayle such into vgly hole vvhich loke on him so pitiously. But vvantons some perhaps vvil say that vvomen they haue hartes most strong And oft sing merily careavvay soone after many a paynful prong, VVhich can not vvell vvith reason be, fince dayly sight doth teach vs this, They neuer naked vveapon see but streyght they faynt vvorse skeard then hur Her strenghe of body is most small the vveakest man that may be founde If any strength he hath at all, soone tryps her dovvne, she treades so ligh Therfore me thinkes great reason might▪ persvvade this raging Death to spare Such vveaklinges from that paynfull plight, to choke them vvith such sovver fare.
Then can by arte be vvel displayde, to Death claymes neere affinity Therefore the louer rightly sayde and can by none be vvel denayed That sure it is a deadly payne to loue and not be loued agayne.
