And the prohemye of the auctour begynneth. Myn auctour wryteth in this prohemye That many men / haue trauayled here tofore To she we by reason and auctoryte That it is grete wytte / and wysdome more For euery maner wyght / of woman bore To lyue in fraunchyse / at his lyberte Than seruaunt to hym selfe / and thrall to be

And afterwarde retorned neuertheles Home to theyr lande / in grete prosperyre Whiche they tyll now haue holde in lyberte Unto theyr owne vse / prouffyte and auayle Wherfore folkes of many a nacyon Lyuynge in seruage / constreyned with trauayle Desyred to haue theyr habytacyon In fraunce / and there vnder domynacyon To lyue in wele / lyberte / and rest Wherby it grewe / somtyme the noblest Realme of the worlde / that knowen were or founde. Moost fayre in buyldynge / and inhabyte best The whiche in treasure / and scyence dyde habounde Then for asmoche / as they be fre at leest Prudent in fayth / in lyuynge holyest They sholde theyr subgets / in fraūchyse kepe & vse After theyr lawe / and neuer to refuse Ageynst all trouthe / and inconuenyent It is certayne / and nothynge charytable God knoweth well / the lorde omnypotent A man to haue / a custome reasonable Onely for hym selfe / ryght prouffytable And for his neyghboure / vse it otherwyse Suche vsage sholde / all well dysposed men dyspyse Herofit groweth that lyberte is lost In people voyde / of reason and scyence And thus vyces and synnes reygneth most Some gyue to vertues lytell reuerence Wherin to god / do they ryght grete offence
The comyn wele / in generalyte All men sholde loue of perfyte charyte Why it is thus / a man may reason make Who loueth not his wele pertyculerly Hath but a lytell wytte I vndertake Whan he may haue a prouffyte syngulerly Hurtynge none other creature therby And wyll not helpe hym selfe whan he so may But wylfully dooth cast his grace away A fole is he / that wyttynge wyll go Into a caue / a dyche / or elles a pytte Whiche is aboue / bothe narowe and strayte also And all within / full wyde and depe is it So that whan he therin / is fall and shytte Out may he not / for there he must abyde As wylde bestes do in forestes syde Trapped and taken / ryght so this crature In lyke wyse / thrugh his owne neclygence Is in the dyche / where as he must endure Lyke as these bestes / whiche gladly wolde go thens Sekynge the wayes with all theyr delygence Out to auoyde / but so it wyll not be Tyme is not then / forth of the dyche to fle Thus one may say / and therupon conclude By suche as in to maryage be brought And herupon to make a symylytude Unto the fysshe whiche hath his pasture sought And in a lepe / that is oft wygges wrought Is take / and out can not escape net wynne

Though it so be / that folkes se before These wedded men / within the lepe enclosed In poynt to droune & drenche / yet not therfore Wyll they forbere / ne tyll they be innosed As houndes be of bones / it is supposed There is not one / by other can be ware Tyll they be take / and holden in the snare Thus what by foly / fortune or destene A man may se the people euery day Demeane themselfe / forsakynge lyberte And shortely after that / repenteth they Desyrynge it to haue / but they ne may At ony tyme / vnto suche grace attayne And all to late / for them is to complayne Moche more herof / myn auctoure dooth declare In his prologue / or that he wyll begyn To she we these .xv. Ioyes / but I must spare By losse of tyme / there is nothynge to wynne But pouerte / vnthryftynes / and synne Wherfore in wordes rude to make an ende And of these Ioyes to wryte now I entende Some men do call these Ioyes sorowes grete But yet they take them well in pacyence For of necessyte they must forgete The care / trouble / sorowe / payne and offence The whiche they suffre at the reuerence Of theyr wyues / whiche they may not forsake And though they oft / mysse vse theyr eloquence Lytell regarde therto a man sholde take
