Of the Eclipses this present Year, 1668. FOur Eclipses hapneth this Year, 1668. Two of the Sun, and two of the Moon. The first of the Moon, and last of the Sun will only be seen of us in Britain. That of the Moon begins the 16 day of May, about 2 hours in the morning, and ends about 5 in the morning. That of the Sun hapneth upon the 25 day of October, about the 12th hour of the day. The Plagues incident this year, are these: 1. The plague of Poverty, when a man hath not a peny in his purse, credit with his neighbours, nor a hole to hide his head in. 2. The Plague of Discontent, when a Husband shall find cold chear, and hot words from a scolding Wife. 3. The Plague of Contention, when a Travailer hath a long journey, a tyred horse, and little money. 4. The Plague of Marriage, when a woman possesseth a husband that is very poor, yet jealous: young, yet a cholerick fool. 5. The Plague of Debt, when a man hath much to pay, little to discharge, and an unmercifull Creditor. 6. The Plague of Hunger, when a man sees or smelle good chear, and hath an excellent stomack, but knows not how to get it. 7. The Plague of Ingratitude, when a man hath much wealth, and no wisdome; much coyn, and no conscience; continual health, and no grace to return thanks unto him that bestowe it on him.
