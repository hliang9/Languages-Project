A ROYALL STORY, FOR LOYALL READERS. For they intended mischiefe against thee, and imagined such a device as they are not able to performe.

Ejaculation. MAy God and his Annoynted the King, and all that are God's, and his Annoyn∣ted the King's, forgive me, if in these thoughts, whilst they were yet invisible, or now that they are become legible, I have offen∣ded him, or them: humane fraielties excepted, I hope I may appeale to Heaven, the searcher of all hearts in poynt of my integrity, in the matter of Loyalty, and in the honest and hearty intendment of these Papers; Lord, continue and encrease all good designes in my breast, untill they come to that perfection thou wilt please to accept: And O thou, whose proper worke it is, to make the peo∣ple of one house to be of one minde, and to whom 'tis equally possible, to make those of one or more Kingdomes to be so too: Blesse (in thy time and way, and that in the time and way present, if it be thy holy will) these distracted, devided Kingdoms, with composed, united mindes; that after so hor∣rible, and so long a seperation from thee, by Re∣bellion, Blasphemy, Sacrilegde, Murther, and all o∣ther deadly sinnes, we may once againe, enjoy thee
our God of Peace, in Peace, and by thee, thy Vice∣gerent our King, and under him, our Church, our Lawes, our Liberties, and our mutuall Loves, through Jesus Christ the eternall sonne of thy love, in whom thou hast loved us first. Amen. Now know I that the Lord helpeth his Annoyn∣ted, and will heare him from his Holy Hea∣ven, even with the wholesome strength of his right hand. NAy, nay! forbeare, forbeare Gentlemen; judge not that ye be not judged; 'Tis not to you, high flying Youths, but to the so∣berly Loyal soules, who have candour as well as judgement, that I intend these; for your parts, you were ever too rash in your actions, and uncharitable in your censures for my conversation: Pray pardon me that I am by mischance rusht into your company; indeed, I was looking for a more grave society; you know I affect not yours, and I am not ignorant that you hate mine; therefore if you take ill this my misfortune, pray tell me be∣fore I go, 'tis not generous, to calumniate behinde
any mans back; if I have offended, I am ready to cry you mercy, or give you any handsome satisfa∣ction in its defect, meane while, I kisse your hands Gentlemen, and leave you to the wise mans first Course, eate, drink, and be merry: yet may I finde you hereafter to be recollected, or but once be∣calmed amidst the surges and surfets of your sinfull excesses, I shal then present you with his second course; but remember, that for all these things you must come to judgement, and I'le adde too, that you know not how soone, the times are dangerous, swords are drawne, and the thread of mans life, as twas ever soone cut or knapt asunder, so it seems now to be environed with Armies of weaponed and engin'd men, at contest, which shal give first that fatall blow, and as the tree fals, so it lies, as life leaves, death and Judgement find; Vestigia nulla retrorsum, who rememembreth thee in the grave? saith valiantly holy David; shal the dead praise thee? no, no, the living, the living, they shal prayse God: Therefore damne not, sink not now, lest you sink and be damned for ever: God wil not blesse, nor the King accept such persons; some of you know it from Breda, and I could tell you more from His Majesties owne mouth to an acquaintance of ours; His Majesty now stands up∣pon His Fathers headlesse shoulders, and sees the plagues attending the cursing, drinking, debaucht crew which help'd bring to the Scaffold
the barbarously murthered (but most blessed Mar∣tyr) CHARLES the first, who saw indeed in His time, and sorrowed for, but could not help, the vics of His Armies and abuses of His Commisio∣ners and Governours, the former His gracious Meditations let you and all the world know. As to the latter, I am satisfied from His owne sacred lips, when upon occasion of my giving His Majesty (according to the duty of my command) an ac∣count of affaires and persons in the West of Eng∣land, His Majesty (deare King) was pleased passio∣nately to tell me, that he was confident the relation I gave was just, and patiently he added (Oh the mirrour!) that he was reduced to that unhappy condition, as to be forced to trust Knaves and knew not how to help it. Our present King, CHARLS the second (such a Son to such a Father, as I believe the world never paraleld) though reduced certain∣ly to as much necessity, as ever so great a Prince was, what time as he went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdome to another people, (God suffering no man though to do him wrong a∣broad) he became an object of pitty (mixt with ad∣miratiō) from all the nobly disposed persons in the world, and an object of scornings & lashings of the Independent English tongues, especially in Holland, that had never seen him, but such as with the Queen of Sheba (hearing of his fame) came to behold the magnanimity of his courage, and the constancy of
his vertues in the banishment from His other Roy∣all possessions, became astonished, and either re∣turned convinced, penitent and Loyall, or else seized with horrour, went home trembling in their soules, at the sight of His sacred Pre∣sence, that I have charity to hope, an holy ope∣ration from His Majesties divine influence, will steale them also by degrees to their own salvation; yet this King (strangely happy, and I know not how it comes to passe) in this low condition, (as it seemed to the world) was then (now His Majesty is in power is more) a strict reprehender of vice, and a vigilant observer of those who became too sawcy with Majesty (clouded in fortune onely, not in face) and kept up by his owne grace and pre∣sence, a Kingship perfectly in himselfe, not disco∣vering the least passion for the absence from His Crownes, which was the greater conquest then of the world, and that desire of His Martyr'd Father hath therein taken effect, when he wished, rather that he might prove CHARLES le bon, then CHARLES le grand; indeed as the world alrea∣dy knowes Him CHARLES the good, for I be∣lieve, that goodnesse is now leading His Majesty by the hand to greatnesse (having sought the King∣dome of Heaven first, the rest shalbe added,) and according to the old Prophesie, as he is e Carolo Carolus, so he wilbe shortly Deo annuente Carolo magno major; and that I alwayes saw with the eye
of faith; but since the beginning (stilo novo) of June 1650. Gods immediate hand hath guided the King visibly to the eye of sense and reason (yet a∣bove comprehension too:) And at this day His Majesty, by the conduct of Heaven, is arrived, from the most uncertaine (I may say desperate) condition, wherein His Majesty then was, to so great a degree of glory, as was then wholely de∣spaired of by most, that ever he would have com∣passed in this world; for, what clouds were over His Majesties affaires at Breda! after a treaty there began with the Scots Commissioners? to effect which treaty, there was no small difficulty atten∣ded His Majesty at Jersey, where His Majestyes Privy Counsell, Lords, and Counsell at Law were divided in opinion; nay, the Duke of York, that most hopefull and illustrious Prince was perswaded in judgemēt, for the King to declare against all treaties with that party of Rebell Scots, His Highnesse and the discenting Lords, relying wholely with Gods blessing, on the formerly almost miraculous Mar∣quesse of Montrosse, who was then gone to kindle a loyall fire by His Majesties Commission, in the Highlands of the Scottish Nation, but Gods wayes are unsearchable, and his works past finding out; the Kings heart is in Heavens hand, and he dispo∣seth it as Rivers of waters, which way soever plea∣seth him; and though most think it tedious to wait on Gods providence in the weary steps which
must be taken, about the meanders, dividings, and unitings, turnings and returnings of the streames (after many miles straggling, passing againe neare the same place) and though almost all that look not with the eye of faith more steddily than the eye of reason, not only lose the current when it entereth the concaves and hollowes of the earth, but their hopes too, and are possessed with despayre of ever seeing those refreshing waters breake out any more: yet the hand of God brings them to life a∣gaine, though they channelled under many an hill and rocky cragge, hee cuts a way to their appea∣rance, and satisfieth the world by experience, That his leading Providence never leaveth them untill they bee sefely brought to the Sea, their Centre, where they embosome in the greatnesse and glory of the triumphant Ocean. Blessed bee God, that leaveth not his Anoynted comfortlesse, nor our Soveraigne Councellesse; He himselfe whose name is Mighty, Councellour, proves his Councell; de∣signing strangely, first to winnow and try the Kings fayth by affliction, laying low that founda∣tion, whereon he intends to erect so glorious a fa∣brick, as ever since (and before) Heaven hath been modelling in our gratious King, whose heart divi∣ded in the division of his friends and Councell, u∣nites againe in God, who strongly enclines his soul to treat, with the illest look't and falsest hearted party that ever drew breath, in that noble Nation
of Scotland, in almost all whose Countenances, a∣ny man that durst look in their faces (which I con∣fesse I could never scarce doe, without feare and trembling, for our deare Kings sake) might visibly read treachery and most abominable falshood; their Priests Prayers and Preachings, premising nothing but slavery to the King, and their groanings and whinings, only to gull the silly flocke that could have so much unchristian patience as to hear them. His Majesty by this Treaty, if hee could not con∣vince them into an agreement, (which if any thing, unlesse a contract to lay down his life, and (which was infinitely dearer) his Honour, he was resolved to bring them to, if not,) yet his Majesty would leave them excuselesse in whatsoever might be the consequence, that so they should by their owne ir∣religious, and avaritious capitulations, and sawcy rejections, affronting their Maker in the person of his Anoynted, draw their owne guilt, and their owne bloud, upon the pates of them and their po∣sterities. The King during this Treaty, had a hard taske, to comport with variety of tempers and constitutions, so, as to keepe them, though enemies one to another, friends to himselfe. The Com∣missioners often grew peremptory; but at such time, his Majesty would quickly awe them into some reverence, by letting them know hee was their King. His Majesties old friends, that all wi∣shed one end, yet unhappily divided in their opi∣nions
of the meanes thereunto conducing, grew to asmuch jealousie and enmity one with another, as ever the Presbyterians and Independents were at: So, that the friends to the Treaty, looke on the op∣posers, as enemies to the King, and the other party reciprocally on them, that not onely the declarers, became averse one to another, but the moderate or neuters, (who waited for the Kings Highway) ha∣ving their soules bound up in Buffe of obedience to Him in eyther, became neglected or mistrusted of both; yet the Treaty goes on, the antipathy under∣mines the whilest, and it is beleeved Marquesse MONTROSSE was perswaded from thence, by pri∣vate instructions from eminent persons, to make a bolt or a shaft of his businesse, to winne the horse, or lose the saddle; breake the Treaty by Conquest, or at least attempt something to make the Treaters more modest, which his Excellency putting in ex∣ecution during the Treaty, fayled of those friends in Scotland, and of those supplies of horse, armes, men, and (as the sinew of all warre) money, from Forreigne Kings and Princes, which probably had the Treaty never began, or had beene then ended, he would have found, and have beene accompani∣ed with wonted successe. But his Excellency (all these things falling under a strong fate) became most unfortunately taken in his first designe, was carried Prisoner to Edenborough, where hee was met with the Sentence of Condemnation, to bee
hanged by the common Hangman, (O unworthy bloudy Judges!) which he cheerefully embraced, and they most barbarously put in Execution with all speed, to hasten his death and glory and their owne sinne and shame together, and that power which the Kirke onely feared in the person of that gallant MONTROSSE, being now layd low, they resolve to break all treaties with the King, but in the nick the Commissioners had con∣cluded with His Majesty, and His Majesty was re∣moved with them from Breda towards Scotland; His Majesty no sooner came to Hounslowdike (an house of the Prince of Oranges neare the sea side) in order to his voyage, but His Majesties cares were there saluted with the unwelcome newes of the death of that incomparable MONTROSSE, the deep sense whereof so pierced His Majesties Royall heart, that there could not but arise new conflicts within His Princely soule: The opposite Lords 'tis probable take this advantage to renew their arguments of disswasion: And His Majesty was no doubt at a great straite what to resolve; to take notice of pittyed MONTROSSE either by word or looke, (I may say) His Majesty durst not, (though he dared do any thing heaven should com∣mand) lest then the squinting Commissioners should grow jealous of his love to them, by any kindnesse His Majesty might shew to his deare MONTROSSE'S memory; if His Majesty should
goe with them now, He saw well, that that party that had contributed to the Execution of his Royall Fathers Person, had already executed his owne pre∣sent power in His Commission to brave MON∣TROSSE; and therefore if His Majesty went, 'twas with apparant danger to His owne life: If he stayd he knew not which way to turne him∣selfe, that yeare must needs be quite lost, for all the Offers and Officers from Denmark and Swe∣den, and all other asistance, the Scots had rejected, as able to do the businesse (they intended) alone; besides, His Majesty should be strangely look'd on the world over: And more then this, His Maje∣sties word was passed, and no other visible means left for His Majesty to bee active towards His Crownes at present; after all which considerati∣ons, Heaven inclines the Kings heart, and His Majesty most cheerfully approves, and on Sunday morning 9. of June (stilo novo) 1650. before the Sun appeared, was His Majesty taking Coach for Trehagh, and so to take shipping, divers of His Majesties Lords and Servants having beene aboard three or foure daies before in His Majesties ship, and divers of the Scots Commissioners and Priests had beene as long in their ship; a noble young Lord and my selfe having on the Saturday evening come off from His Majesties Ship, were onely af∣ter His Majesties departure from Hounslowdike left there behinde, condoling His Majesties condi∣tion,
and following him with our prayers for Hea∣vens protection: His Majesty had not been gone two houres, (my Lord and my selfe retiring to the next harbour to refresh before we tooke Boat for the Hague) but in comes a waggon full of those Priest-ridden Commissioners, and those Commissi∣oner-ridden Priests) such a Gallimofery of ill looks I know not how to expresse them) enquiring strict∣ly for His Majesty, whom we soon let know, that His Majesty was newly gone, at which they seemed much troubled, and going into the next roome to us, they drew out their papers and perused them, in consultation what next to do, by which and their ill-boding countenances, we easily guessed that they had brought some new tormenting Pro∣positions, and so, soone after we heard, they had received, sent to them from the power in Scotland, after Marquesse MONTROSSE was shamefully butchered, which 'tis believed were so much high∣er then formerly, that His Majesty could not with honour have granted, but would rather in probabi∣lity have dissolved the Treaty, which was their de∣signe, intending (as tis thought, having now freed themselves of their feares of MONTROSSE) no more complyance with His Majesty, rather choo∣sing to adhere to the fortune of their swords: But a good providence had (before these tormentors could recover the Sea shore again) safely conveyed His Majesty on Shipboard; so the Commissio∣ners
they take Shipping too, and His Majesty (with three ships only of Hollands men of Warre) sets sayle for Scotland, relying on heaven as His best Convoy, under the shaddow of whose wings he shall not miscarry, which brought him, in his time to a desired Port: His Majesty had no sooner quitted the Holland shore, but the three new-built English rebell Friggots (the best that ever were) called the faithfull Speaker, the President, and the FAIRFAX, came upon the Holland Coast in quest of the King, sending to the Hague, they found the King was newly gone, thereupon set sayle North∣wards in pursuance of His Majesty, whom after they had sought two dayes, with a brave gale of winde they came upon the North Coast of England neare Scotland, where missing the Kings Fleet, they called a Counsell, at which 'twas concluded, that if the King had the same winde with them, (whereof there was no doubt) then His Majesty by that time must needs be in Scotland, setting sayl a day (at least) before them, so the Counsell resol∣ved to sayle according to their former orders to∣wards the West of England, quitting all hopes of their old trade of King-catching for that bout. This Relation ANTH. YOUNG Captaine of the President made to me. Whereas His Majesty was three and twenty dayes at Sea, blessed (as it pro∣ved) with contrary windes, and crossed (as they thought then) with calmes; so that His Majesty
was forced to put into an Island, in the King of Denmarks dominions, for fresh provisions, where His Majesty himselfe in a disguise went on shore, and soone returned, and at length they came neare the Scottish ground, very far Northwards (so far that they out went night, being able to read under decks the smallest print, when 'twas least light) and when the King with his Fleet came to the mouth of Straboggy on one side of the harbour, a squadron of the English Rebell Ships, which had layen there∣abouts, as an ambushment for his Majesty (have∣ing their expectation of him wearied) then sayled outwards on the otherside, so neare were they meeting each other, that they on the shore looked with no small admiration, whilst one party was sayling in, and the other out; But by reason of a thick Scottish mist that then fell, they were indis∣cernable each to other, at least the Rebell English did not espy the Royall Fleet, God being to them as to the Israelites of old, a cloud to conceale them from their English Enemies; indeed Scotch ones had then possession of his Majesties Person, as more clearely every day appeared; for before his Ma∣jesty was permitted to land, they offered a disloy∣all violence to his Majesties righteous Soule, and 'tis admirable to observe, the wonders that God wrought in the deepe for His Majesties Preservati∣on so far, for in all probability, had His Majesty not set saile when he did, (neither sooner nor later)
had He had one gale of winde more, or one calme lesse, or any thing but what God did (now appa∣rently) then allot for Him, His Majesty had beene made a prey to His devouring Enemies, or entom∣bed in the monumentall Ocean: But his Majesty (thankes be to God) safely lands at Straboggy in the Highlands, being entertained the first night by the Loyal Marquis HUNTLEY, at his house, and that being so far Northwards, proves no small ad∣vantage to His Affaires; for the people all the way came in to see, seeing admire, and admiring love with honour their distressed (but made by Gods blessing on their affection a most hopefull) Prince: Whereas had His Majesty landed nearer St. John∣stones (if possibly he could) yet in all probability it had been very unhappy; for when His Majesty comes thither, though they salute him with haile Master (King of Jewes indeed) yet they cut Him short in reallity, not admitting His Majesty to sit in their Councels, either of State or War, nor to be in the Army, because the Souldiers were so taken with (and fond of) Him, which the Kirke were jealous of, lest in time He should get their Crowne from them, for they resolve, that at best He shall have onely the name of King, the Soveraigne pow∣er is fit to recide in the Kirke alone, those inspired sonnes of Government; and if His Majesty can but once bring His faith to that spirituall pitch, as to believe as the Kirke believes, He shall not need
trouble Himselfe with any thing else. They'l ease His head of cares, and His shoulders of all Kingly burthens; His Majesty shall need onely Signe and Seale what they please, and Himselfe may hawke, hunt, and enjoy those Noble Recreations suitable to His Youth the while, and if this will not con∣tent Him, He shall be brought to the Stoole of Re∣pentance, heare God and Himselfe (his Annoyn∣ted) blasphemed in their next belching prayers, and afrighting preachments (as an Antidote against which His Majesty might not be permitted to take any of His Orthodox Divines, either English or Scottish Chaplaines over with Him) and His En∣glish, and many Scotch Lords, Officers, and house∣hold servants are banished the Court. His Maje∣sty must further then, be humbled under the pride of these spirituall Trumpeters, but it shall be sayd to be for the sinnes of His Fathers house, and the Idolatry of the Queen his Mother: Indeed His Ma∣jesty must (must was never used for a King in this sence before) doe whatsoever they'l have Him doe, if He intend to have any rest in life, or respite from death. Well, His Majesty (wise as an Angell) acts now the part of a Subject, heares, sees, and sayes nothing, Blessed be God, that hath endued so yong a body with so prudent a minde, with so meeke a soule, a soule so humble, that I am confi∣dent God reveales his secrets to Him, as he hath promised to doe to those that are so qualified to re∣ceive
them, but he resisteth the proud, and the lof∣tinesse of the Kirkemen foreruns their destruction; God so infatuates their Counsels, as that in the great pride of their hearts, notwithstanding CROM∣VVELL had entered the Kingdome of Scotland, with a potent Army, from whom surely they ex∣pacted little mercy, yet in the nick of time before they should have fought with him, did this Kirk-Faction, proudly presuming upon their owne strength, and being bewitched with an opinion of their owne righteousnesse, disband and cashiere divers thousands (the best Officers and Souldiers) of their Army, resolving to carry on the worke, onely with their owne spirituall Bumkins, an heard of untutor'd Disciples, and these were of the Kirks teaching to fight Ex tempore, as they should bee unpremeditately, by an impulse of spirit put upon it; CROMVVELL notwithstanding findes him∣selfe too weake for these Kirkers, and resolves, as privately and as speedily as he may, to ship away his traine, his wounded, and his sick men at least, if not all his infantry and so breake away with his horse, to which purpose hee makes towards Dunbarre, where the English Fleet lay ready; the Kirkers, (principled in this particular purely like Cowards, who naturally presse hard upon a running party, no holding them from pursuing such as flye, more then perswading them to engage handsomely against a party that will stand, but)
those zealous hotspurs follow violently CROM∣VVELS reere, before he could ship his Artillery, and encamp so neare to their Army, that CROM∣VVELL sending a party to a passe in his way to England, to see whether it were open, and finding it possessed by the Scots, and himselfe necessitated to fight or yield dishonorably, resolves to make a desperate venture, and expect the issue of a bold attempt; (Audaces fortuna juvat, timidos{que} re∣pellit:) had those Kirkers learnt our English Pro∣erbe (as they may do in time) give them rope and they'le hang themselves, they had then certainly been better advised, then to make an Enemy either desperate or contemptible, or to put that in hazard by a fight, which they might (upon the matter certaily) have compassed by forbearing, had they possessed their soules in patience; but it seemes they wanted that beliefe, which keeps people from making hst, and they finding CROMVVELL to be but in a stinking condition, his Army being ex∣treamly weakened with the Flux, (which so vio∣lently seized upon them, that 'tis sayd they were oced to march with their breeches untrussed in heir hand, ready to give (not fire, but) water or bloud at a minutes warning. They pursue the chase whilest the scent was hot, and CROMVVEL ng thus streightned, wisely gives the first blow, so they go too't: Now fight Dog, fight Beare, nei∣ther barrell better herring, tis ten thousand to one,
but if Traytors be beaten, Rebels prove Conque∣rours: The matter receives a sudden issue, whe∣ther by Gods immediate providence, that this way (and no other) his and the Kings Enemies, should at this time, destroy his and the Kings Enemies, by their infatuated division of interests, (Quos Deus vult perdere, dementat prius:) or whether as a meanes thereunto conducing, some of the Scots Officers (as 'twas believed) proved treacherous, or whether onely out of improvidence or necessity, the season being wet, and the Scots Army very weary, the foot generally having not their matches lighted, and were (non vino, sed somno sepulti,) all sleepy and drowzy, when CROMVVELL by the assistance of that fate, which constantly appeares with active soules (vigilantibus, non dormientibus) gave them betimes in the morning a resolute and unexpected charge (mixed with a frightfull sur∣prize) and put the whole Army into such a confu∣sion, that though there were on each party many slaine, (of the Scots most) yet I can hardly call it a Battell, for unlesse Major Generall ROBERT MONGOMERY (yongest son to the Earle of Eg∣lington) had with a body of Horse under his Command, and the Atholl Regiment of foot, which were all cut off, maintained the field a while (which by both sides they are acknowledged to doe very gallantly) the businesse had scarce received a dispute; however (ultra posse non est esse) MONGO∣MERY
was over-powred by the adverse Horse, (which indeed was their maine strength) CROM∣VVELL proves victorious, slew as 'tis generally about 4000. on the spot, and tooke about 00. Prisoners (besides the wounded men which turned off, to a very great number) amongst the rest, Leivtenant Generall LUMSDALE, sayd to be a very good Officer, and stout, was taken, but the unchristian usage which the common souldiers of the Scotch Party received, in their Imprisonments, from those that led them away captive, by fami∣shing and surbating them in their cruell and tedi∣ous overmarchings towards Newcastle, and then quartering them in a great Cabbage field, when they came there, before they could otherwise be disposed of, suffering the poore creatures, to have nothing to eate bu their owne flesh, or that as raw food, (too cold for over heated bodies,) the Cabbage leaves and  to satisfie their hungry appetites, there the sad Scots eate & dye soon, most of them, and the rest live a while longer, and doe worse (by degrees they all perished) under that Monster, Sir ARTHUR HASELRIGGE Gover∣nour, whose  in this, and his barbarous carriage at Chichester thentofore (where after Ar∣ticles made, and the Towne delivered to them, he barbarously caused Musketeers to give fire in at a window, upon Sir CHRISTOPHER LEVVK∣NER the Governour, (differing onely with Sir
ARTHUR in Argument after liberty given of dis∣course, and other then unarmed Officers, being in a roome quietly together) and his vile carriage in other places, during this Warre (which got a habit in him, by being unnaturally cruel to his owne Mo∣thers sonnes, from his Youth) make him appeare one of the most unparalleld Rebels in this adulte∣rous Generation, and may forever discourage any from taking quarter from so base an Enemy, (chu∣sing rather to fall into the hands of God, then man, (whose very mercies are cruel) by attempting the highest actions that may hope to be crowned with a noble life, or an honourable grave) But thus ends the maine Scene of the chiefe Act in this Tra∣gedy betweene CROMVVELLS and the Kirkes Factions, Saints both of the new Edition, and I hope of no great duration, onely CROMVVELL hath the luck to be the longer liver, and having snuft out the glory of the Kirkes new light, which heere expires in a stinke, possesseth himselfe of the City of Edenborough, and Towne and harbour of Lieth, presently garrisoning Lieth, and besiedging the impregnable, well ammunitioned, and provisi∣oned Castle of Edenborough, whereof one DUN∣DAS was the unworthy (Governour, who (after some inconsiderable siedge) through the corrupti∣on of reward or cowardize, or both, delivered it up to CROMVVELL, upon Articles, and continued afterwards under his protection, where for the pre∣sent
he inherits the shame, and may heereafter re∣ceive the reward of an unfaithfull servant to a gra∣tious Master. The King this while is where he was, at St. Johnstones, not being before admitted to the Army, whereof the remainder now repaires towards him, and possessing the Towne and Castle of Sterling, which cōmanded the Bridge over Firth River into the County of Fife, the Armies have time now to breath and to looke one upon another: The Kirke Army thus growne weake in their num∣ber, (not in the confidence of their Clergy) the Loyal Highlanders, and those Northerne Gallants under Marquesse HUNTLEY, the Earle of ATHOL, and Livetenant Generall MIDLETON, begin to modell themselves for His Majesties Service; the King knowing their ancient Loyalty, receives fresh hopes of good towards Him: But the Kirke are as crosse of His Majesties interest still, as before, and for the Kings sinnes, and for the sinnes of his Fa∣thers house (they say still) it must needs be, or for theirs in having to doe any thing with Him, that this great overthrow and straite was come upon them: His Majesty well perceiving their villany, was very solicitous to cast Himselfe and Cause up∣on Gods Providence, and the fidelity of those Nor∣therne Nobility and Gentry, and to that purpose removed Himselfe, with some of His servants, privately from St. Johnstones towards them, the faithfull Lord NEVV: BURGE, Livetenant Colo∣nel
of His Majesties Regiment of Guards, with all those loyal soules that would goe with Him, de∣clares to waite upon His Majesties Person, and fol∣lowes Him; but by a Providence (working all for the best in the end) His Majesty was overtaken by some of the Kirkes more moderate friends, who partly by argument, and partly by their greater number in Armes, use a kinde of violent perswasi∣on, and prevaile with His Majesty to returne to St. Johnstones, promising all the Honourable Recep∣tion that's possible; and now indeed, and not be∣fore, (another Power appearing) His Majesty is admitted to sit in Councell with them: But Sir JOHN BROVVNE with a part of the Kirke Army must needes go to reduce the Northerne Forces un∣der MIDLETON, His Majesty is desired to com∣mand them to disband; yet the matter was com∣posed by Gods blessing upon His Majesties Wise∣dome and Intercessions without blowes: The King they agree shall be crowned the first day of January, which being happyly performed, he be∣came the New Yeares Centre then, to which all parts of the Circumference made addresse, and the great worke which His Majesty begins to labour at, is to bring all Parties and Interests to reconcile in Himselfe, (Hic labor, hoc opus est) which, whilst His Majesty is doing, by way of digression I take liberty to let you know, that CROMVVELL and the Councell of State of ENGLANDS New Com∣mon-wealth,
this while doe not lesse bestir them∣selves, not onely by open force, but by all manner of secret treachery, and Machivillian policy, to sub∣vert and destroy our most hopefull King: One of their cursed workes of darkenesse being more emi∣nently come to light, was thus damnably contri∣ved: MORS, an active Villaine, when formerly servant to Sir WILLIAM ERMYN of the North, deceased, a notorious vermine, that whilst he live∣ed, was alwayes knawing at the roote of Monar∣chy, and Viper-like eating away to his owne inven∣tions, through his mothers bowels; but he is dead, and his servant MORS, receiving a double portion of his wicked spirit, after his (feared descention) departure, bestirs himselfe in His Masters and Grand-fathers errand, the more industriously, designed by the infernall Councell of White-Hall, (which now is become a den of Thieves, and a cage of every uncleane Bird) That he should pre∣tend himselfe since the murther of our King to be a great Convert, the Engagement to be faithfull to ENGLANDS Common-wealth, established with∣out King or Lords, he should by no meanes ap∣prove: So that being wholly dissatisfied with the present Power, and to avovd the penalties for non∣conynce, he quits the Kingdome, and takes an hu to himselfe, Wife, and Family at Callais in France, where he had not beene above a moneth or so, but under pretence of his conversion, be∣coming
acquainted with some of His Majesties Friends, expresseth a great desire he had to go to Paris to gaine the honour of kissing our Queenes hand, and to offer Her Majesty his service, which they very readily encourage him in, and addresse him to some of Her Majesties servants, upon which he comes to the Queenes Court, and was brought to Her Majesty, who gave him Her hand to kisse; MORS takes the confidence to discover the deepe sence he had of Her Majesties sufferings, and the extreame sorrow wherewith he was affected, for the barbarous murther of Her King and Husband, confessing he had been so unhappy, as in the time of Warre, to act in his sphere for the Parliament, believing their thoughts towards His Majesty had been equally innocent with his, which though up∣on better consideration he found injudicious, they had nothing of that guilt in their intentions of (which proved the sad consequence of all their actions) His Majesties death; yet inasmuch as he was sometime so unfortunate as to move or breathe in that wicked way, he knew nothing too hazard∣ous for him, by way of expiation for his former offences, to venture against CROMVVELL, (or any other, but) him he looked on as the great Dictatour and Commander in that high mischiefe, and if her Majesty pleased to command him, he would either by poyson or stob, though with the certaine losse of his owne life, give a period to
CROMVVELLS dayes. Her Majesty (the Mir∣rour of Her Sex for constant love and loyalty to Her King and Husband) pierced to the heart with this fresh renewing of her griefe, in the losse of her incomparable King and Consort, after She had re∣collected Her selfe, answered, that he might ap∣prehend that offer as some satisfaction to himselfe, but she had better learnt Her Saviour, and would not by any consent of Hers, take the matter out of Gods hands, who had sayd vengeance was his, and he would repay, in whose due time, She expected to see their ruine that had committed that unheard of murther, the Fountaine of Her and all Loyall Subjects misery, the shame of Christen∣dome, and the astonishment of the known World, to which MORS replies, that though her Majesty was not pleased to accept of his service in that par∣ticular, yet, by that, he hoped her Majesty believed he would then be ready to doe any thing lesse dan∣gerous; wherein he might serve her Majesty to∣wards a publick good, and her Majesty he con∣ceived must needs have affaires of weight with the King, and to send to His Majesty, as he under∣stood she did by the way of Holland, was very un∣certaine, tedious, and expensive, as a quicker dis∣patch; if her Majesty could think of any service he could doe, in that or any thing else, he would un∣dertake to go from Calais to Dover, and so by land, much sooner, and in respect of his knowledge in
the North, much safer he believed, and would ven∣ture his life to carry Letters or message from Her Majesty to the King: Her Majesty glad at all times to have opportunity to present her duty and love to her Sonne the King, and at that time having some more immediate businesse with His Majesty, embraceth MORS his offer, and prepares Letters to the King; MORS no sooner receives them (with promise of all sidelity and secrecy) but posts away for England; at Whitehall he ac∣quaints his Black Masters how far he had succeeded in this dark designe, (at which Hell and they tis to be supposed kept a private thanksgiving) MORS receiving fresh encouragement and instructions, hyes away for the North, and in great pretended privacy comming into Lieth, there hee disguiseth himselfe into womans apparrell, in that habit cun∣ningly passeth over the water to Burnt Island, where after he was harboured, he sends to the Go∣vernour, imparting the matter to him, that hee came from the Queene, &c. and desired his assi∣stance that he might be presently fitted with mans cloathes againe, and accommodated with Horses and Guides to goe to the King, then at St. John∣stons, the Governour glad of the employment, doth accordingly: MORS no sooner comes to Court, but there meets him a Major, an English Gentleman, who (knowing him most maliciously active formerly, against the King) saluted him,
asking him whether he were a Convert, MORS tels him the same kinde of lamentable story of his sadnesse which before he had told the Queene, and that the Queene had honoured him with Letters to the King, which hee was in great hast to deliver; the Major joy'd at his conversion presseth him to drink a Cup of Scotch Ale with him upon the Guard, before he went in to the King, when they came into the Court of Guard, the Major chargeth the Captaine of the Guard with him as a Spye, and causing him presently to be searched, there was found nothing about him, but those Letters from the Queene, which the Major (leaving MORS a prisoner) presents to the King; His Majesty see∣ing his distressed Mother Queenes hand, receiveth them joyfully, and askes for the Messenger, the Major thereupon tels the King what a dangerous person MORS (that brought them) was, of a dis∣position so implacably malicious, that he could not sleep (as the Psalmist sayes) unlesse he had done (at least contrived) mischiefe, and humbly begged the King, that he might be tried as a Spy, for he wus confident he came upon some horrid designe, such another person not being to be found for their pur∣pose; His Majesty advising with his Counsell, and being pressed by many arguments from the Major, granted a Commission of life and death to certaine persons according to the forme of that Kingdome, who calling MORS to triall as a Spy,
he pleaded not onely not guilty, but rather merit in running so great a hazard, to do the King service in a time so dangerous; but the Judges found cause enough to condemne him, and told him they were justified in themselves for what they did upon the evidence given; yet that he might justifie them also to the world, they caused a rack to be brought before him, and Souldiers with lighted matches, told him he was as a dead man already, yet if hee would confesse his intentions, he might receive mercy, else (whether guilty or not guilty at present, must bee betweene God and his Conscience) they would burne his hands and feet with matches, as far as they would burne, that done, they would rack him one joynt from a∣nother, untill he should confesse, or if not confesse, they would execute him at last. MORS seeing death at the doore, and that better dye in an ingeni∣ous confession, then in so much guilt to throw bo∣dy and soule headlong, he, without either the mat∣ches burning his flesh, or the rack torturing his bones, freely confessed the designe was layd by the States of England, and that he had undertaken for reward, to slay innocent bloud; and either by poyson he was to have done it whilest he stayd in expectation of an answer to the Queenes Letters, or if he could not effect that, then, when he recei∣ved his dispatch from the Kings hand, he was re∣solved to have given a fatall blow. MORS thus
having confessed, being condemned, was remaun∣ded to prison: before Execution, the Lord LO∣THIAN (CARRE) His Majesties Secretary, mis∣trusted alwayes for a Juggler with the English Rebels, tells the King that this MORS was the first person condemned to dye by the Kings immediate Power, and humbly propounded, how acceptable a thing it would be to God and man, in his first action to shew rather mercy then judgement; His Majesty answered, that His owne inclination did naturally prompt Him, rather to pardon then pun∣ish Offendors, yet at that time he would not out of that regard remit MORS, but His Majesty would looke upon his Lordships Proposall, as a desire, and His Majesty did not thinke fit to deny a Nobleman of Scotland, the first request that should be made to him after His Coronation; MORS therefore for his Lordships sake should live and not dye, for which his Lordship returned thanks to the King, and within few dayes was repayd it to him∣selfe by CROMVVELL, who had sent his Lord∣ship a Letter gratulatory, which comming by a providence to be made knowne to the King, His Majesty therewith acquainted the Earle of Eglin∣ton, Colonell of His Majesties Regiment of Horse∣guards, (who is my Relater of the story) and pre∣sently His Majesty signed a warrant to the Jaylor, expressing, that though MORS were pardoned, yet that he should keep him close prisoner still,
which warrant His Majesty left to the Earles care, who soon sent it to the Prison, else MORS had been freed; CROMVVELL hereupon by letter disow∣ning the act of MORS, yet at the request of MORS his wife, being great with child, was contented to exchange any one of three Scotch Lievtenant Coolnells (which he named) for MORS: His Ma∣jesty seeing CROMVVELL interest himselfe so farre in the businesse, whom His Majesty had little cause to believe, to be of so gentle a nature, as to exchange an Enemy for an Enemy (as MORS (had he been heartily the Queenes servant) was) at the request of a great belly, denies to exchange him for any of those there, but if Lievtenant Gene∣rall LUMSDALL might be exchanged for him, His Majesty would release MORS, and not else: CROM∣VVEL considering the quality of the Persons (I believe) so unequall, and fearing all the world would then conclude him guilty of MORS his hor∣rid and bloudy intention, (which upon the former grant of a Lievtenant Colonell for his exchange, they had cause enough (besides the native proba∣bility) to imagine) refuseth to exchange LUMS∣DALL; so MORS continued prisoner, where I leave him, (without descanting on so unchristian an enterprize, or aggravating their crime by the Queenes Candor, which doubtlesse made it more out of measure, sinfull) and I heartily wish him, and all that had, or have hands or hearts in so foule
an intention of bloud guiltinesse against so gracious a Prince, either by their actions of open and rebel∣lious hostility, or obscure treachery, hearty and timely repentance before they go hence, and be no more seen. And I blesse God for this mercifull deliverance of his annoynted our King: For, This also commeth forth from the Lord, which is wonder∣full in Counsell and excellent in working. I take leave (begging pardon for this tedious wandring) to returne to His Majesty, whom I finde to have passed strange difficulties, this while with admira∣ble dexterity, and blessed successe. He hath now, God be thanked, made a generall Reconciliation, & enemies to shake hands as his friends, the valiant Earle of Cleveland, and his English Nobility. Of∣ficers and servants, are after so long a banishment from His Majesties presence admitted to their du∣ty, Lords, Faithfull WENTVVORTH and WIL∣MOT, lye in their turnes in His Majesties Bed∣chamber, as in His former freedome: And now the great men of Scotland that were excommuni∣cated from King and Court, returne to their King, and Duke HAMILTON, Marquesse HUNTLEY, Earle of ATHOL, Livtenant Generall MIDDLE∣TON, and the rest, have their sentences recalled, and draw into union with all the moderate of the Army party, so that the power of the Kirkers (which I take to be a mungrell Faction, generated between rigid bytery and Indepency) is now
vanished, now the King as King, commands with∣out the Dictates of those pretended spirituall Guardians, and all Loyal Soules, whose heart God hath touched, (not otherwise designed for the Kings service) repaire from all Parts, to take their fortunes with His Majesty, who shines in Armes, in the Field of Honour, where he is sprung up as a Light for the Righteous, and joyfull gladnesse for such as be true hearted: And though in His way to His Crownes, many Clouds of Disasters may bscure His Light, and by interposition of the Moone, this Sun may sometimes be eclipsed, yet doubtlesse He shall by the goodnesse of God, His Guide, breake through all againe, (as Rivers that often interre, yet still rise with their refreshing streames) at length, a strong earnest of which mer∣cies to come, are Gods deliverances of His Majesty from dangers past, and therefore let every one that's faithfull, continue to doe his Duty, and leave the issue to Gods disposall, who certainely will arise in his owne time, and have mercy upon Sion, and we hope, that time will shortly come, for why? His servants think upon her Stones, and it pittieth them to see her in the dust, as which dust before the winde, shall the Enemies of God and the King, in due time be, and the Angell of the Lord scattering them. FINIS.
