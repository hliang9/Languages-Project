CROMVVEL and his CONFEDERATES, whereby they have a long time abused and cheated both the Houses, City and Country; and the wicked and treasonable things they have done, and unwarrantable means they have used to carry on their own ambitious Designs.

THE Machivilian Cromwellist AND Hypocritical perfidious New Statist. THe Machivilian Practises and Jesuitical Policies of the Cromwellists and Independent Confederacy, in the Houses, Army, City and Country, to accomplish their own ambitious ends, and engross all power into their own hands, by wicked, unjust, and most diabolical means, have been sufficiently laid open to the world by Mr Edwards in his Gangraenaes; and their own Champion, Iohn Lilburn, in his Iglers discovered, his Letters to Cromwel and others; The Anatomy of the Army; The Grand Design or Discovery of that form of Slavery intended, and in part brought upon the free people of England, by a powerful party in the Parliament, and L. G. Cromwel, Commissary General Ireton, and others of that Fa∣ction in the Army; tending to the utter ruine and inslaving of the English Nation: and by other late printed Papers of their own Friends, the Agitators in the Army and City, who charge the Head of that Faction Cromwel (cryed up for the holiest Saint on earth without the least dissimulation, guile or falshood) with these remarkable treasonable Hypocrisies and Contradicti∣ons, detestable both to God and Men. 1. With making many solemn and deep Protestations in the House of Commons, in the presence of Almighty God, upon his faith and honor, that the Army should really disband when ver the House should give but the least order or intimation;
And yet at the same time giving secret order and directions to his Creatures in the Army, not to disband upon any terms, but to keep together and march up to London to force the Hous and City, and compel them by fear to comply with all his un∣just desires and designs. 2. With plotting and ordering in his own Lodgings, at a great meeting there on Monday night before Whitsonday last, the securing of the Garrison, Magazine, and Train of Artillery at Oxford▪ seising the Kings own person at Holdenby, and remo∣ving him thence into the Army; and giving order to Cornet Iyce, with is much speed and serecy as might be, to effect it; which he accordingly did by his special direction; and yet like a subtil Fox▪ proteted to the Hous, the King and others, that it was done both without his Knowledg and approbation. 3. With impeaching the XI Members, and pressing theirs and ohers suspenton from the House before any charge or proof of guilt (contrary to all Law, all rules of Iustice▪ and the Houses Votes) only to strengthen his own Faction in the House, though he knew and acknowledged them to be innocent of the Crimes pretended, in private: and yet exhibiting and printing a most false and scandalous Charge against them, to wound their reputations in publick, by charging them with such crimes, of which he knew himself more guilty then they. 4 With charging the wel-affecting Lords and Commons, who continued sitting and acting in the Houses, when the Spea∣kers and some Members (under pretext of a force past and en∣ded some two or three days before their departing thence) by his Solications and Menaces treacherously withdrew them∣selves from the Houses to the Army; and the Militia, Com∣mon Councel, and Citizens of London, for providing only for their own self-defence by Votes and Ordinances of both Houses; with no less then Treason, in levying a New War against the King. Parliament and Kingdom: When as he and his Confe∣derates only were truly guilty of it, both in seising upon the Kings own person and rescung him from the Commissioners of both Houses by a strong party of the Army; in causing the whole Army to march up to London in a warlike and assailing posture against the Houses express Orders, and forcing them to
repeal their Votes, Ordinances, and yeeld up their Members to their fury; and after that, in marching up with the Army it self to the Houses doors, and City, in triumph, against the Hou∣ses express Letters and Orders, wih the fugitive Members whom they engaged to live and dye with them in that quarrel, and in possessing themselves of all the Works and Forts about Westminster and of the Tower of London, removing the City Guards, and setting new of their own upon the Huses; march∣ing through the City with their whole Army, like Conquerors, and then throwing down their Line and Forts, fist raised for the Houses defence, in a most scornful manner, and beleguring the disrmed King, City and Houses ever since, with the whole body of the Army (which they have doubly recuited to the peo∣ples infinite oppression) to captivate them all to their tyrannical pleasures: Which is a treasonable levying of War, and High Treason in good earnest, uncapable of excuse, transcending that of the impeached Members and Citzens. 5. With forcing the Houses to pass an Ordinance, on the 20. of August last, for declaring all Votes, Orders and Ordinances, passed in one or both Houses, since the force on both Houses, Iuly the 26. until the 6. of August, to be null and voyd; by reason of a force upon the House of Commons, by a company of unar∣med boys and apprentice, only on Iuly 26. towards the Eve∣ning; who vanished that night and never appeared after: not∣withstanding the Speaker and Commons House met and sate the very nxt morning without any disturbance, met securely a the Fst the nx day in Margarets Church, where the Speaker protested, against the honor of his going to the Army under pretext of this forc, as a most dishonorable and unworthy act, which he would rather dye in the House, then be guilty of, to Sir Ralph Ashton and other; and the Friday following most of the Mem∣brs met, elected a new Speaker, and voted and sate without the least violence or disturbnce from the City; til the sixth of August, and passed all Votes, Oders and Ordinances, freely without any colour of force; upon which grounds this Ordi∣nance of repeal, after long debate▪ was by the major voyce of the Commons House passed four or five times in the Negative, and layd aside, and so ought not by the Rules of Parliament or Ju∣stic
to be revived. And yet he and his Confederates enforce the Houses to pass this repealing Ordinance upon a meet pre∣tence of force, by a fr greater armed force and violence then that of the Apprentices, which they made the only ground of this Ordinance of nullity and repeal, enforced to pass against the haire in this manner. First, by a Treasonable Remonstrance from his Evcellency Sir Thomas Fairfax and the Army under his command, sent to the Houses from the Head-quarters at Kingston, August 19. (but dated the 18.) in which p. 18. they take notice of the Commons carrying it in the Negative against this Nulling Ordinance, and thereupon used such high and trea∣sonable Menaces and Expressions against the Members continu∣ing in it during the Speakers absence, as no age nor persons e∣ver heard or read the like; threatning to take them as prisoners of War, and try them by Martial Law; inhibiting them or any of them, to intrude themselves to sit in Parliament, til they had cleared themselves from giving their assent to any of the Votes, Orders or Ordinances, past in the Speakers absence, and to take speedy and effectual courses to restrain them from being their own, theirs, and the Kingdoms Iudges, and to bring them to condign punishment. Secondly, they put double Guards the next day upon both Houses, who openly threatned at the Doors, to pull out all the Members by head and shoulders that sate and voted in the Speakers absence, if they presumed to intrude themselves, or but enter into the House; Whereupon more Members by fear refrined the House, and went presently out of London, then those who fled to the Army. Thirdly, all the Officers, that were Members, came that morning from the Army into the House, where Cromwel and they made very high and menacing speechs which danted many. Fourthly, Colonel Desborough came with a party of 1000 Horse drawn up in a body to Hide∣park-Corner, threatning to force both the Houses and Members, if this Ordinance passed not. And by this Treasonable force, ractise and Declaration, was this nullifying Ordinance, against a thousand-fold less force, forced to pass the House when thin nd empty, by head and shoulders, against the Rules and Free∣dom of Parliaments, through a thin House of Commons, whn most of the Members were kept and driven away for∣cibly
from it, by the whole Army and their Guards, And to evidence to all the world & posterity, that this Ordinance was wrested from the Houses by meer violence, it was even then by Special Order of the Houses, printed and published with that Treasonable thundering Declaration against the House and Members which procured it; dated the 18, sent the 19, of Au∣gust, and read that day and the next in the Houses, and the same day (being the 20th) compelled the House to pass it. Which Or∣dinance declaring all Votes, Orders and Ordinances of one or both Houses to be null and voyd, if procured by force, being thus more forcibly procured then any it repelled, must needs be Felo de se, and declare it self to be more voyd and null then they; which being for the most part made, when the Houses were free by a unanimous Vote, without any division of the Houses, will re∣main firm and valid; notwithstanding this new forcd Ordi∣nance, promoted and carried on, il i passed with greater force then any it repeals. Besides these detestable Machivilian and Hipocritical practi∣ses of Cromwel and his Confederats, be pleased to consider on∣ly of three or four more; which wil manifest them the grea∣test Machivillists and Hipocrites under heaven, never to be cre∣dited or confided in hereafter. 1. The first is, his gulling and deluding his own Confede∣rates and Creatures, the busie Agitators imployed by him, to mutiny the Army into publike Rebellion; who underwent the greatest adventure with the hazard of their necks, to accom∣plish his designs upon the King, Parliament and City, who ha∣ving served his turn; he now most ungatefully casheers, and endeavours to suppress, postatizing from his first principles and pretences of seeking the Kingdoms welfare and peoples Free∣dom, to advance himself, his kindered and allies, though with the Kingdoms and Agitators ruin, playing the meer Jugler, and Hocus-Pocus with them; as their Advocates, Lilburn, Henry Martin, Scot and Rainsborough complain most bitterly, and others of their Fraternity, in sundry of their Pasquills. 2. The 2d is, his and his Confedrates treachery and villany towards the Lord Mayor, Alderen and imprisoned Citizens of London, to whom though they promised all fair quarter in∣dempnity
and security of their first approaches to, and match through the City in triumph; yet soon after they cause them suddenly to be impeached of high Treason, committed to the Tower and other prisons; expell the Recorder (without any legal proof or hearing, from a sudden Report from a packed Committee of those who engaged with the Army) out of the House, and send him to the Tower to accompany the Mayor and Aldermen, where they yet detain them prisoners without any further prosecution; and all this to bring in an Indepen∣dent Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and others of their own Fction, into their plces, and keep them from acting in the City, and be∣ing chosen into publike Offices; In pursuance of which de∣sign, he and they have endeavoured, and lately threatned, to bring up the Army to quarter in the City this Winter, under pretext of levying Arrears; but in truth to bring in what Com∣mon-Councel-men, and other Officers they pleased, of their own Faction, upon the New Elections, and make Allen and Ewick Aldermen; That being prevented of this design, Mr Speaker must discover a New Plot to seize upon the Tower by a company of horse and foot (who must drop out of the clouds) & the Houses too; to bring up the Army to guard them til the new elections be past. But this not taking, and proving as false as he that discovered it, there upon a new Ordinance must be suddainly drawn up, and passed in a moment before any no∣tice of it, to deprive the City and Citizens of their free electi∣ons of their City Officers and Common Councell men, and make many of the best affected among them, who had any hand in the Cities Engagement &c. uncapable to be elected them∣selves, or give any voyce in the election of others; to exclude the Presbyterians and Anti-Sectarists, and bring in a New In∣dependent recruit of Cromwels and the Armies Confederates, to undo and betray the City, Parliament and Kingdom, and en∣thrall them to their bondage; which their Confederacies, En∣gagements and Treasons against the King, Houses, City and Kingdom, must make them capable of all Offices and Prefer∣ments, and disable them from none. 3. The 3d is▪ his and his Confederates in the Armies damn∣ble Hypocrisie and Dissimulation▪ both towards the Houses,
City and Country, and eer cheting them of their money nd free quarter. At first he and thy pretended, that if the Hou∣ses and City advanced but so many moneths pay for the Soul∣diers, they should all presently disband, and not trouble the Country more with Free quarter or Taxes, and that they would pay their quarters out of it. Whereupon the pay desired, was sent and received, and yet never a Souldier disbanded, but new recruits, even of Cavaleers against the Parliament, entertained without the Houses Order, nay against it; and no quarters at all discharged: Since which, upon sundry complaints of the Countries oppression by free quarter, they have four or five several times, at least upon receipt of so many weeks pay set down, faithfully engaged to disbnd their supernumerry For∣ces, lessen the Army, and pay their quarters; yet no sooner is the money desired, received▪ but they refuse to do either, and grow more high and insolent in their demands then ever▪ and more oppressive to the Country. At the last general Rn∣dzvouz▪ they made the like promise of disbanding and paying quarters, upon the recipt of forty thousand pounds, which with much difficulty was procured and sent (though the Forces in Ireland, in great want, and auall hard service against the Rebels, are like to perish for want of pay, while these Idle droans devour all the money the Houses can rake up by any means) and thereupon some supernumerary Forces and Re∣cruits were actually disbanded, and word sent of it to the House▪ but within a day or two they were all agin entertai∣ned, and others to boot, by Ordr from the General and Coun∣cell of War, corary to their Egagement, and the Houses Or∣der; and not one penny payd the Country for ee quarter and within two or three days after, a new Represntation (ful of Ar∣rogancy and Insufferable language) must be sent▪ to the Houses, wherein they demand the sixty thousand pounds monethly tax, to be augmented to one hundred thousand; justify their not disbading the supernumeraries, augmented by them now to such a number▪ that the whole Kingdom can neither pay, nor qurter them without ruin. And now they make demnds of new sums, and then thy wil obey the Houses Orders just as they did before; and thus they cheat the Parliament, City and
Country of their money, and free quarter too; and though they pretend themselves no Mercenary people, but publike spirited Saints, who regard no pay but higher ends; yet they stick not impudently to press the Houses over and over, against their Votes, and vote it in their Councel of War in opposition to all the Houses; That all Deans and Chapters, Lands, Forrest-Lands, the remainder of Bishops Lands shl be sold, the fines of the Impeached Citzens, and Lords (whose only Treason is, that they are Rich and Faithful to their Country, and opposite to their real Treasons) and the third pat of all Delinquents, of he Excse too, in course, designed for payment of their preten∣ded Arrears, since their refusal to disbnd▪ and yet must have one hundered thousand pounds a moneth levyed on the King∣dom, besides, for present pay, to maintain them in their muti∣nies and Rebellions, and ruin the Parliament, King, Kingdom, and dying Ireland. 4. His detestable malicious Chargng the XI Impeached Members most falsly, with The Particu∣lar Charge of he Army.holding private intelligence with the Kings party, drawing up and sending Propositions privately to the King, for settling of a peace without the Houses privity; hol∣ding Correspondency with disaffected persons, to put conditions up∣the Parliament, and bring in the King upon their own terms; undertaking to do more for the King then the Army would do; obstructing the relief of Ireland, favouring Delinquents and Ma∣lignants, giving no accompt for the great summes of money they received, driven away the Parliament Members. And thereupon by violent mans enforced them to quit the House (and some of them the Kingdom too) though innocent, and not convicted of any of those crimes. And yet himself and his Creatures in the Army, at the self same time and ever since, holding private intelligence with the King and his Party; admitting them into the Armies quarters, and there keeping Cabinet Counsels with the chiefest of them, drawing up, and sending Propositions pri∣vatly to the King without the Houses privity▪ holding correspon∣dency with Sir Edw. Ford, Sir Iohn Bently Ashburnham, Legg, Dr Hammond, Dr Sheldon, and other desperate Malignants, and confederating with them to put conditions on the Houses, and bring in the King upon his own terms; undertaking to do
more for the King then the Scots or Presbyterians, removing him from Hampton Court to the Isle of Wight (put into the hands of Colonel Hammond for that purpose some moneths be∣fore) to accomplish his designs the better; obstructed Irelands relief boh with men and money almost a year together, and in∣tercepting all the moneys, that should now supply the pressing necessities, to pay his mutinous idle Army, for undoing the Kng∣dom and eating out the Country▪ pleaded openly in the House for the exemption of the greatest Malignants in Arms out of the first and second Articles, because the Army had (without the Houses privity) engaged to mitigate their fines and interceed in their favor, though they aggravate the pretended offences of the injuriously impeached Lords and Citizens to the highest, pressed their exemption out of the general pardon and Act of Oblivion; and desire the confiscation of their whole estates: hath hithero given no Accompt of the vast sums of Money, Horse and Arms he hath received from the State, professing that he cannot do it: and driven many of the faithfullest Parliament Members both out of the House and Kingom. And therefore deserves to be suspnded, imprisoned, cast out of th House, and driven out of the Kingdom as a most Treacherous Impostor and Traytor to the Parliament, City and Kingdom, whose ruine he endevors, to prevent his own. This is the Faith, Honesty, Sincerity and plain dealing of these Cromwellists and Machivilian Saints; the infamy of the Gospel; the shame of Christianity; the Sinks of all Hypocrisie, Fraud and Treachery, and unsatiable Gulfs of avarice, whose consciences are now so free and large, that they can swallow down the geatest sins, contrive and carry on the grossst Villanies and Treasons against their King and Country, Church and State; betray and impech their best and dearest Friends, blow up Parliaments, make use of any Iesuitical Policies, an unlawful means and instruments, to accomplish their exemplary, tempo∣ral and eternal ruine, if they repent not speedily, which God give them Grace to do in time. FINIS.
