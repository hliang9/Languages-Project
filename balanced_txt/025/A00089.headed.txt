In the yeer of the Reign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, the Sixteenth. And now Published for the due observation of them, by His Majesties Authority under the Great Seal of England. LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. 1640.
CHARLES, By the grace of GOD, King of England, Scot∣land, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting. Whereas our Bishops, Deanes of Our Cathe∣drall Churches, Arch-deacons, Chapters and Col∣ledges, and the other Clergie of every Diocesse
within the severall Provinces of Canterburie and Yorke, being respectively summoned and called by vertue of our severall Writs to the most Reverend Father in God, Our right trustie, and right wel∣beloved Counceller, William, by divine providence, Lord Arch-bishop of Canterburie, Primate of all England, and Metropolitan, And to the most Re∣verend Father in God, Our right trustie and wel∣beloved Counceller: Richard, by divine providence, Lord Arch-bishop of York, Primate and Metro∣politan of England respectively directed, bearing date the twentieth day of Februarie, in the fif∣teenth yeer of Our reign, to appear before the said Lord Arch-bishop of Canterburie in Our Cathe∣drall Church of S. Paul in London, And be∣fore the said Lord Arch-bishop of York, in the Metropolitan Church of S. Peter in York the four∣teenth day of April then next ensuing, or elswhere, as they respectively should think it most conveni∣ent to treat, consent and conclude, pon certain diffi∣cult and urgent affairs contained in the said Writs; Did thereupon at the time appointed, and within the Cathedrall Church of S. Paul, and the Metro∣politan Church of S. Peter aforesaid, assemble themselves respectively together, and appear in severall Convocations for that purpose, according
to the said severall Writs, before the said Lord Arch-bishop of Canterburie, and the said Lord Arch-bishop of York respectively. And foras∣much as We are given to understand, that many of Our subjects being misled against the Rites and Ceremonies now used in the Church of Eng∣land, have lately taken offence at the same, upon an unjust supposall, that they are not onely con∣trary to Our laws, but also introductive unto Po∣pish superstitions, whereas it well appeareth unto Vs upon mature consideration, that the said Rites and Ceremonies which are now so much quarrelled at, were not onely approved of, and used by those learned and godly Divines, to whom at the time of Reformation under King Edward the sixth, the compiling of the Book of Common Prayer was committed divers of which suffered Martyrdome in Queen Maries dayes) but also again taken up by this whole Church under Queen Elizabeth, and so duely and ordinarily practised for a great part of her Reign (within the memory of divers yet living) as that it could not then be imagined that there would need any Rule or Law for the observation of the same, or that they could be thought to savour of Popery. And albeit since those times, for want of an ex∣presse
Rule therein, and by subtile practises, the said Rites and Ceremonies began to fall into disuse, and in place thereof, other forrain and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in; Yet foras∣much as in Our own Royall Chappels, and in many other Churches, most of them have been ever con∣stantly used and observed, We cannot now but be very sensible of this matter, and have cause to con∣ceive that the authors and fomentors of these jea∣lousies, though they colour the same with a pretence of Zeal, and would seem to strike onely at some sup∣posed iniquity in the said Ceremonies; Yet, as We have cause to fear, ayme at Our own Royall person, and would fain have Our good Subjects imagine that We Our Self are perverted, and do worship God in a superstitious way, and that we intend to bring in some alteration of the Religion here esta∣blished. Now how far We are from that, and how utterly We detest every thought therefore, We have by many publike Declarations, and otherwise upon sundry occasions, given such assurance to the world, as that from thence We also assure Our Self, that no man of wisdom and discretion could ever be so beguiled as to give any serious entertainment to such brain-sick jealousies; and for the weaker sort, who are prone to be misled by crfty seducers, We
rest no lesse confident, that even of them, as many as are of loyall, or indeed but of charitable hearts, will from henceforth utterly banish all such causlesse fears and surmises, upon these Our sacred professi∣ons, so often made by Vs, a Christian Defender of the Faith, their King, and Soveraign. And there∣fore if yet any person, under whatsoever mask of zeal or counterfeit holinesse, shall henceforth by speech or writing, or any other way (notwith∣standing these Our right, hearty, faithfull, and so∣lemn protestations made before him, whose Deputy We are against all and every intention of any Po∣pish innovation) be so ungracious and presumptu∣ous as to vent any poisoned conceits, tending to such a purpose, and to cast these devilish aspersions and jealousies upon Our Royall and godly proceedings, We require all Our loyall Subjects, that they forth∣with make the same known to some Magistrate, Ec∣clesiasticall or Civill; And We straightly charge all Ordinaries, and every other person in any authority under Vs, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perill, that they use no palliation, conni∣vence, or delay therein; but that taking particular information of all the passages, they do forthwith certifie the same unto Our Court of Commission for causes Ecclesiasticall, to be there examined, and pro∣ceeded
in with all fidelity and tendernesse of Our Royall Majestie, as is due to Vs their Soveraigne Lord and Governour: But forasmuch as We well perceive that the misleaders of Our well minded people, do make the more advantage for the nourish∣ing of this distemper among them from hence, that the foresaid Rites and Ceremonies, or some of them, are now insisted upon but onely in some Diocesses, and are not generally revived in all places, nor con∣stantly and uniformly practised thorowout all the Churches of Our Realm, and thereupon have been lyable to be quarrelled and opposed by tem who use them not; We therefore out of Our Princely incli∣nation to Vniformity and peace, in matters especi∣ally that concern the holy worship of God, proposing to Our self herein the pious examples of King Edward the sixth, and of Queen Elizabeth, who sent forth Injunctions, and Orders about the divine Service, and other Ecclesiasticall matters, and of Our dear Father of blessed memory, King James, who published a book of Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiasticall; and (according to the Act of Parliament in this behalf) having fully advised herein with Our Metropolitan, and with Our Com∣missioners authorised under Our great Seal for causes Ecclesiasticall, have thought good to give
them free leave to treat in Convocation, and agree upon certain other Canons necessary for the ad∣vancement of Gods glory, the edifying of his holy Church, and the due reverence of his blessed Myste∣ries and Sacraments: that as We ver have been, and by Gods assistance (by whom alone We reign) shall ever so continue carefull and ready to cut off superstition with one hand, so We may no lesse ex∣pell irrverence and profanenesse with the other, whereby it may please Almighty God, so to blesse Vs, and this Church committed to Our govern∣ment, that it may at once return unto the true former splendour of Vniformity, Devotion, and holy Order, the luster whereof for some yeers by past hath been overmuch obscured, through the devices of some ill affected to that Sacred Order, wherein it had long stood from the very beginning of the Reformation, and through inadvertencie of some in authority in the Church under Vs: We there∣fore by vertue of Our Prerogative Royall, and Supream authority in causes Ecclesiasticall, by Our severall and respective Letters Patents under Our Great Seal of England, dated the fifteenth day of Aprill now last past, and the twelfth day of May then next following, for the Province of Canter∣bury; And by Our like Letters Patents dated the
seven and twentieth day of the same mneth of Aprill, and the twentieth day of the moneth of May aforesaid, for the Province of York, did give and grant, full, free, and lawfull libertie, licence, power and authoritie unto the said Lord Arch-bishop of Canterbury, President of the said Convocation, for the Pro∣vince of Canterbury, and unto the said Lord Arch-bishop of York, President of the said Con∣vocation for the Province of York, and to the rest of the Bishops of the said Provinces, and unto all Deanes of Cathedrall Churches, Arch-deacons, Chapters and Colledges, and the whole Clergie of every severall Diocesse, within the said severall Provinces, and either of them, that they should and might from time to time, during the present Parliament, and further during Our will and plea∣sure, conferre, treat, debate, consider, consult, and agree of and upon Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, as they should think necessary, fit, and convenient for the honour and service of Almighty God, the good and quiet of the Church, and the better government thereof, to be from time to time observed, performed, fulfilled, and kept, as well by the said Arch bishop of Canterbury, and the said Arch-bishop of York, the Bishops, and
their successours, and the rest of the whole Clergie of the said severall Provinces of Canterbury and York, in their severall Callings, Offices, Functions, Ministeries, Degrees, and Administrations; As by all and every Dean of the Arches, and other Judges of the said severall Arch-bishops, of Courts Guardians of Spiritualties, Chancellours, Deanes and Chapters, Arch-deacons, Commissaries, Offi∣cials, Registers, and all and every other Ecclesia∣sticall Officers, and their inferiour Ministers what∣soever, of the same respective Provinces of Can∣terbury and York, in their, and every of their di∣stinct Courts, and in the order and manner of their, and every of their proceedings, and by all other persons within this Realm, as farre as lawfully be∣ing members of the Church it may concern them, as in Our said Letters Patents amongst other Clau∣ses more at large doth appear. Now forasmuch as the said Lord Arch-bishop of Canterbury, President of the said Convocation for the Province of Canterbury, and the said Arch-bishop of York, President of said Con∣vocation for the Province of York, and others the said Bishops, Deans, Arch-deacons, Chapters and Colledges, with the rest of the Clergie, having met together respectively, at the time and places before
mentioned respectively, and then and there, by ver∣tue of Our said authority granted unto them, treated of, concluded, and agreed upon certain Canons, Or∣ders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, to the end and purpose of Vs limited and prescribed unto them, and have thereupon offered and presented the same unto Vs, most humbly desiring Vs to give Our Royall assent unto the same, according to the form of a certain Statute or Act of Parliament made in that behalf in the 25th. yeer of the Reign of King Henry the eighth, and by Our said Pre∣rogative Royall and Supream authority in Causes Ecclesiasticall, to ratifie by Our Letters Patents under Our great Seal of England, and to confirm the same, The Title and Tenour of them being word for word as ensueth.
Constitutions and Canons Eccle∣siasticall, treated upon by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, Presidents of the Convocations for the respective Provin∣ces of Canterbury and York, and the rest of the Bishops and Clergie of those Provin∣ces: And agreed upon with the Kings Majesties Licence in their severall Synods begun at London and York 1640. In the yeer of the Reign of our Soveraign Lord, CHARLES, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, and Sixteenth. I. Concerning the Regall power. WHereas sundry Lawes, Ordinances, and Constitutions have been for∣merly made for the acknowledg∣ment and profession of the most lawfull and independent authority of our dread Soveraign Lord, the Kings most Excellent Majestie, over the State Eccle∣siasticall and Civil: We (as our dutie in the first
place bindes us, and so far as to us appertaineth) enjoyn them all to be carefully observed by all per∣sons whom they concern, upon the penalties in the said Laws and Consttutions expressed. And for the uller and clearer instruction and in∣formation of all Christian people within this Realm in their duties in this particular; We do further ordain and decree, That every Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Preacher upon some one Sunday in every quarter of the yeer at Morn∣ing prayer, shall in the place where he serves, treat∣ably, and audibly read these explanations of the Regall power here inserted. THE most High and Sacred order of Kings is of Divine right, being the ordinance of God himself, founded in the prime Laws of nature, and clearly established by expresse texts both of the old and new Testaments. A supream Power is given to this most excellent Order by God himself in the Scriptures, which is, That Kings should rule and command in their severall dominions all persons of what rank or estate soever, whether Ecclesiasticall or Civill, and that they should restrain and punish with the temporall sword all stubborn and wicked doers. The care of Gods Church is so committed to Kings in the Scripture that they are commendd when the Church keeps the right way, and taxed when it runs amisse, and therefore her government belongs in chief unto Kings: For othrwise one man would be commended for anothers care, and
taxed but for anothers negligence, which is not Gods way. The power to call and dissolve Councels both na∣tionall and provincial is the true right of all Christi∣an Kings within their own Realms or Territories: And when in the first times of Christs Church, Prelates used this power, 'twas therefore onely be∣cause in those dayes they had no Christian Kings: And it was then so onely used as in times of persecution, that is, with supposition (in case it were requird) of submitting their very lives unto the very Laws and Commands even of those Pagan Princes, that they might not so much as seem to disturb their Civill Government, which Christ came to confirm, but by no means to under∣mine. For any person or persons to set up, maintain, or avow in any their said Realms or Territories re∣spectively, under any pretence whatsoever, any in∣dependent Coactive power, either Papall or Popu∣lar (whether directly or indirectly) is to under∣mine their great Royall office, and cunningly to overthrow that most Sacred ordinance, which God himself hath established: And so is treasonable against God, as well as against the King. For subjects to bear Arms against their Kings, offensive or defensive, upon any pretence whatso∣ever, is  the least to resist the Powers, which are ordained of God: And though they do not invde, but onely resist, St. Paul tels them plainly, Thy shall receive to themselves damnation.
And although Tribute, and Custome, and Aide, and Subsidie, and all manner of necessary support and spply, be respectively due to Kings from their subjects by the Law of God, Nature, and Nati∣ons, for the publike defence, care and protection of them: yet nverthelesse, subjects have not onely possession of, but a true and just right, title and propertie, to, and in all their goods and estates, and ought so to have: And these two are so far from rossing one another, that they mutually go toge∣ther, for the honourable and comfortable support of both. For as it is the dutie of the subjects to supply their King: so is it part of the Kingly of∣fice to support his subjects in the property and free∣dom of their estates. And if any Parson, Vicar, Curate, or Preacher shall voluntarily or carelesly neglect his duty in publishing the said explications and conclusions, according to the Order above prescribed, he shall be suspended by his Ordinary, till such time as upon his penitence he shall give sufficient assurance, or evidence of his amendment; and in case he be of any exempt jurisdiction, he shall be Censurable by his Majesties Commissioners for Causes Ecclesia∣sticall. And we do also hereby require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other inferiour Priess and Mini∣sters, that they preach, teach, and exhort their peo∣ple to obey, honour, and serve their King; and that they presume not to speak of his Majesties power in any other way then in this Canon is expressed.
And if any Parson, Vicar, Curate, Preacher, or any other Ecclesiasticall person whatsoever, any Deane, Canon, or Prebendarie of any Collegiate or Cathe∣drall Church, any member or Student of Colledge or Hall, or any Reader of Divinity, or Humanity in either of the Universities, or elswhere, shall in any Sermon, Lecture, Common place, Determination, or Disputation either by word or writing, publikely maintain or abett any position or conclusion, in op∣position or impeachment of the aforesaid explica∣tions, or any part or article of them, he shall forth∣with by the power of his Majesties Commissio∣ners for Causes Ecclesiasticall, be excommunicated till he repent, and suspended two yeers from all the profits of his Benefice, or other Ecclesiasticall, Academicall, or Scholasticall preferments: And if he so offend a second time, he shalbe deprived from all his spirituall promotions, of what nature or degree soever they be. Provided alwayes, that if the offence aforesaid be given in either of the Universities, by men not having any Benefice or Ecclesiasticall preferment, that then the delinquent shall be censured by the ordinary authority in such Cases of that University respectively, where the said fault shall be com∣mitted.
II. For the better keeping of the day of his Majesties most happy Inauguration. THe Synode taking into consideration the most inestimable benefits which this Church enjoyeth, under the peaceable and blessed government of our dread Sovereign Lord, King CHARLES; And finding that aswell the godly Christian Emperours in the former times, as our own most religious Princes since the Reformation, have caused the dayes of their Inaugurations to be publikely celebrated by all their Subjects, with Prayrs and Thanksgiving to Almighty God; and that there is a particular form of Prayer appointed by authority for that day and purpose; And yet with all considering how negligent some people are in the observance of this day, in many places of this Kingdom Doth therefore decree and ordain, that all manner of persons within the Church of Eng∣lan, shall from henceforth celebrate, and keep the morning of the said day, in coming diligently and reverently unto their Parish Church or Chappll at the time of Prayer, and there continuing all the while, that the prayers, preaching, or other service
of the day endureth; in testimony of their humble gratitude to God for so great a blessing, and dutifull affections to so benigne and mercifull a Sovereign. And for the better execution of this our Ordinance, the holy Synode doth straitly require and charge, and by authority hereof enableth all Archbishops, Bishops, Danes, Deanes and Chapters, Arch-dea∣cons, and other Ecclesiasticall persons, having ex∣empt or peculiar jurisdiction; as also all, Chancel∣lors, Commissaries, and Officialls in the Church of England, that they enquire into the keeping of the same in their Visitations, and punish such as they shall finde to be delinquent, ccording as by Law they are to censure, and punish those who wilfully absent themselves from Church on Holy∣dayes. And that the said day may be the better observed, We do enjoyn, that all Church-wardens shall provide at the Parish charge, two of those books at least, appointed for that day, and if there be any want of the said book in any Pa∣rish, they shall present the same at all Visitati∣ons respectively.
III. For suppressing of the growth of Popery. ALl and every Ecclsiasticall per∣sons, of what rank or condition soever, Arch-Bishops, and Bi∣shops, Deanes, Arch deacons, all having exempt or pculiar juris∣diction, with their severall Chan∣cellours, Commissaries, and Officials, all prsons intrusted with cure of soules, shall us rspectivly all possible car and diigence by conferring private∣ly with th parties, and by ensures of the Church in inferiour and higher Courts, as also by com∣plaints unto the Scular power, to reduce all such to the Church of England, who are misld into Popish superstition. And first these private Conferences shall be per∣formed in each severall Diocesse, either by the Bi∣shop in person, if his occasion will permit it, or by some one or mor learned Ministers at his speciall appointment, and the said Bishop shall also designe the time and place of the said severall Conferencs, and all such persons as shall be present therat which if Recusants refuse to observe, they shall be taken for obstinate, and so certified to the Bishop.
And if the said tie and place be not observed by the Minister or Ministers so appointed, they shall be suspended by their Ordinary for the space of six moneths, without a very reasonable cause alleadged to the contrary. Provided that they be not ent above ten miles from their dwelling. If the said Conferences prevail not, the Church must and shall come to her Censures, and to make way for them, the said Ecclesisticall persons shall carefully inform themselves in the places belonging to their severall charges, of all Recusants above the age of twelve yeers, both of such as come not at all to Church, as also of those who coming sometimes thither, do yet refuse to receive the holy Eucharist with us, as likewise of all those, who shall either say, or hear Masse: and they shall in a more especi∣all manner enquire ot all those, who are ither dangerously active to seduce any persons from the Communion of the Church of England, o sditi∣ously busie to disswade his Majesties subjects from taking the oath of Allegiance, together with all them who abused by their Sophistry, refuse to take the said oath. And we straighly command all Parsons, Vi∣ars, and Curates, that they carefully, and severally present at all Visitations, the names and surnams of the delinquents of these severall kindes in their own parishes, unde pain of suspension for s mo∣neths. And likewise we straightly enjoyn all Church-wardens and the like sworn Officrs whatsoever,
hat by vertue o their othes, they shall present at the said Visitations the names of such persons, whom they know or hear of, or justly suspect to be delinqent, in all or any of these particulars, and that under the pains of the highest censures of the Church: that so these delinquents may be legally cited, and being ound obstinate, they shall be ex∣communcated, and such excommunication shall be pronounced both in the Cathedrall Church of the Diocesse, and in the severall Parishes where such Recusants live, and every third moneth they shall be again publikely repeated in the places aforesaid, that all may take notice of those Sentencs. And because there are places which either have, or pretend to have exemptions, in which such de∣linquents do usually affect to make their aboad; Therefore we enjoyn, that all Bishops shall within their severall Diocesses, send unto such places one or more of their Chaplains, or some of their offi∣cers whom they may relie on, to make strict inquiry after ofnders in those kindes, who diligently re∣turning their information accordingly, the said Bi∣shop shall certifie such informations to his Metro∣politan, that the aforesaid proceedings may forth∣with issue from some higher Courts in these cases, whereof by reason of the said exemptions the inf∣riour Courts can take no cognisance Bu if neithr Confrring nor Censures will pre∣vail with such persons, the Church hath no way left but complaints to the secular power; and for them we saitly enjoyn, that all Deanes and Arch-deacons,
and all having inferiour or exempt Juris∣diction, shall every yeare within sixe moneths af∣ter any Visitation by them holden, make Certifi∣cate unto their severall Bishops, or Archbishop, (if it be within his Diocesse) under their Seale of Office, of all such persons who have been presen∣ted unto them as aforesaid, under pain of suspension from their said Jurisdictions by the space of one whole yeare. And we in like manner enjoyne all Archbi∣shops and Bishops, that once every yeare at the least, they certifie under their Episcopall Seale in Parchment, unto the Justices of Assise of every County in the Circuits and within their Diocesses respectively, the names and sirnames not onely of those who have been presented unto them from the said Deanes, Archdeacons, &c. but of those also who upon the oathes of Church-wardens and other sworne men at their Visitations, or up∣on the information of Ministers imployed in the said Conferences, have been presented unto them, that so the said intended proceedings may have the more speedy and the more generall successe. In particular, it shall be carefully inquired into at all Visitations under the oathes of the Church-wardens and other sworne men, what Recusants or Popish persons have been either married or bury∣ed, or have had their children baptized otherwise then according unto the Rules and Formes esta∣blished in the Church of England; and the names of such delinquents (if they can learne them, or
otherwise such names as for the time they carry) shall be as aforesaid given up to the Bishop, who shall present them to the Justices of Assise, to bee punished according to the Statutes. And for the education of Recusants children, since by Canon already established, no man can teach Schoole, (no not in any private house) except hee bee allowed by the Ordinary of the place, and withall have subscribed to the Articles of Religion established in the Church of England; We there∣fore straightly enjoyne, that forthwith at all Visi∣tations there bee diligent enquiry made by the Churchwardens or other sworne Ecclesiasticall Officers of each Parish, under their oathes, who are imployed, as Schoole-masters to the children of Recusants; and that their severall names be pre∣sented to the Bishop of the Diocesse, who citing the said Schoole-masters shall make diligent search whether they have subscribed or no; and if they or any of them bee found to refuse sub∣scription, they shall bee forbidden to teach here∣after, and censured for their former presumption; and withall the names of him or them that enter∣taine such a Schoole-master, shall be certified to the Bishop of the Diocesse, who shall at the next Assise present them to the Judges to bee proceeded against according to the Statutes. And if they subscribe, enquiry shall be made what care they take for the instruction of the said children in the Catechisme established in the Book of Common Prayer. And all Ordinaries shall censure those
whom they finde negligent in the said instruction; and if it shall appeare, that the Parents of the said children doe forbid such Schoole-masters to bring them up in the Doctrine of the Church of En∣gland, they shall notwithstanding doe their duty; and if thereupon the said Parents shall take away their children, the said Schoole-masters shall forthwith give up their names unto the Bishop of the Diocesse, who shall take care to returne them to the Justices of Assise in manner and forme afore∣said. And because some may cunningly elude this Decree, by sending their children to bee bred be∣yond the seas, Therefore wee ordaine that the Church-wardens and other sworne Ecclesiasticall Officers shall likewise make carefull enquiry, and give in upon their oathes at all Visitations, the names of such Recusants children, who are so sent beyond the seas to be bred there, or whom they probably suspect to bee so sent: which names as aforesaid shall be given up to the Bishop, and from him returned to the Judges as aforesaid, that their Parents, who so send hem, may be punished accor∣ding to Law. Provided alwayes that this Canon shall not take away or derogate from any power or authority already given or established by any other Canon now in force. And all the said Complaints or Certificates shall be presented up to the Judges in their severall Circuits by the Bishops Register, or some other of his Deputies immediately after the publishing of his Majesties Commission, or at the end of the
charge, which shall bee then given by the Judge. And this upon paine of Suspension for three moneths. This sacred Synode doth earnestly intreat the said Reverend Justices of Assise, to bee carefull in the execution of the said Lawes committed to their trust, as they will answer to God for the daily encrease of this grosse kinde of superstition. And further, we doe also exhort all Judges, whether Ecclesiastical or Tempoall upon the like accompt, that they would not admit in any of their Courts any vexatious Complaint, Suit or Suits, or Pre∣sentments against any Minister, Churchwardens, Questmen, Sidemen, or other Church-Officers for the making of any such Presentments. And lastly, we enjoyne that every Bishop shall once in every yeare send into his Majesties High Court of Chancery, a Significavit of the names and sirnames of all such Recusants who have stood excommunicated beyond the time limited by the Law, and shall desire that the Writ De excommu∣nicato capendo might bee at once sent out against them all Ex Officio. And for the better execution of this Decree, this present Synode doth most humbly beseech his most sacred Majesty, that the Officers of the said High Court of Chancery, whom it shall concerne, may bee commanded to send out the aforesaid Writ from time to time as is desired, for that it would much exhaust the particular estates of the Ordinaries, to sue out se∣verall Writs at their owne charge. And that the
like command also may be laid upon the Sheriffes and their Deputies, for the due and faithfull exe∣cution of the said Writs, as often as they shall be brought unto them. And to the end that this Canon may take the better and speedier effect, and not to be deluded or delayed; We further decree and ordaine, That no Popish Recusant, who shall persist in the said sen∣tence of Excommunication, beyond the time pre∣scribed by Law, shall be absolved by vertue of any Appeale in any Ecclesiasticall Court, unlesse the said partie shall first in his or her owne person, and not by a Proctor, take the usuall Oath De parendo Iuri, & stando mandatis Ecclesiae. IV. Against Socinianisme. WHEREAS much mischiefe is already done in the Church of God by the spreading of the damnable and cur∣sed Heresie of SOCINI∣ANISME, as being a com∣plication of many ancient Heresies condemned by the foure first generall Councels, and contrariant to the Articles of Religion now established in the
Church of England: And whereas it is too ap∣parent that the said wicked and blasphemous er∣rours are unhappily dilated by the frequent di∣vulgation and dispersion of dangerous Books written in favour and furtherance of the same, whereby many, especially of the younger or un∣setled sort of people, may be poysoned and infe∣cted: It is therefore decreed by this present Sy∣node, That no Stationer, Printer, or Importer of the said Books, or any other person whatsoever, shall print, buy, sell, or disperse any Booke, broa∣ching or maintaining of the said abominable Do∣ctrine or Positions, upon paine of Excommunica∣tion ipso facto to be thereupon incurred: And wee require all Ordinaries upon paine of the Censures of the Church, that beside the Excommunication aforesaid, they doe certifie their names and offen∣ces under their Episcopall Seale to the Metropoli∣tan, by him to be delivered to his Majesties At∣torney Generall for the time being, to be procee∣ded withall according to the late Decree, in the Ho∣nourable Court of Star-chamber, against spreaders of prohibited Books. And that no Preacher shall presume to vent any such Doctrine in any Sermon under paine of Excommunication for the first of∣fence, and Deprivation for the second. And that no Student in either of the Universities of this Land, nor any person in holy Orders, (excepting Graduates in Divinity, or such as have Episcopall or Archidiaconall Jurisdiction, or Doctors of Law in holy Orders) shall be suffered to have or reade
any such Socinian Booke or discourse, under paine (if the offender live in the University) that he shal be punished according to the strictest Statutes pro∣vided there against the publishing, reading, or maintaining of false Doctrine; or if he live in the City or Country abroad, of a Suspension for the first offence, and Excommunication for the second, and Deprivation for the third, unlesse he will abso∣lutely and in terminis abjure the same. And if any Lay-man shall be seduced into this opinion, and be convicted of it, he shall be excommunicated, and not absolved but upon due repentance and abju∣ration, and that before the Metropolitane, or his owne Bishop at the least. And wee likewise en∣joyne, that such Bookes, if they be found in any prohibited hand, shall be immediately burned: and that there be a diligent search made by the appointment of the Ordinary after all such Books, in what hands soever, except they be now in the hands of any Graduate in Divinity, and such as have Episcopall or Archidiaconall Jurisdiction, or any Doctor of Lawes in holy Orders as afore∣said; and that all who now have them, except be∣fore excepted, be strictly commanded to bring in the said Books, in the Universities to the Vice-chancellors, and out of the Universities to the Bishops, who shall returne them to such whom they dare trust with the reading of the said Books, and shall cause the rest to be burned. And we farther enjoyne, that diligent enquiry be made after all such that shall maintaine and defend the
aforesaid Socinianisme, and when any such shall be detected, that they be complained of to the se∣verall Bishops respectively, who are required by this Synode to represse them from any such pro∣pagation of the aforesaid wicked and detestable opinions. V. Against Sectaries. VVHEREAS there is a pro∣vision now made by a Ca∣non for the suppressing of Poperie and the growth thereof by subjecting all Popish Recusants to the greatest severitie of Ecclesi∣asticall Censures in that be∣halfe: This present Synode well knowing that there are other Sects which indeavour the subver∣sion both of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England no lesse then Papists doe, al∣though by another way; for the preventing thereof doth hereby decree and ordain, That all those pro∣ceedings and penalties which are mentioned in the aforesaid Canon against Popish Recusants as far as they shall be appliable, shall stand in full force and
vigour against all Anabaptists, Brownists, Separa∣tists, Familists, or other Sect or Sects, person or persons whatsoever, who do or shall, either ob∣stinately refuse, or ordinarily, not having a lawfull impediment (that is, for the space of a moneth) neglect to repair to their Parish Churches or Chap∣pels where they inhabit, for the hearing of Divine Service established, and receiving of the holy Com∣munion, according to Law. And we do also further decree and ordain, that the Clause contained in the Canon now made by this Synod against the Books of Socinianisme, shall also extend to the makers, importers, printers, and publishers, or dispersers of any Book, writing, or scandalous Pamphlet devised against the discipline and government of the Church of England, and unto the maintainers and abettors of any opinion or doctrine against the same. And further, because there are sprung up among us a sort of factious people, despisers and depra∣vers of the Book of Common prayer, who do not according to the Law resort to their parish Church or Chappel, to joyn in the publique prayers, service, and worship of God with the congregation, con∣tenting themselves with the hearing of Sermons onely, thinking thereby to avoid the penalties due to such as wholly absent themselves from the Church. We therefore for the restraint of all such wilfull contemners or neglecters of the Service of God, do ordain that the Church or Chappell War∣dens, and Questmen, or Sidemen of every parish,
shall be carefull to enquire out all such disaffected prsons, and shall present the names of all such dlinquents at all Visitations of Bishops, and other Ordinaries; And that the same proceedings and penalties mntioned in the Canon aforesaid re∣spectively, shall be used against them as against othr Recusants, unlesse within one whole moneth after they are irst denounced, they shall make ac∣knowledgement and reformation of that their fault. Provided alwayes, that this Canon shall not dero∣gat from any other Canon, Law, or Statute in that behalf provided against those Sectaries. VI. An Oath injoyn'd for the preventing of all Inno∣vations in Doctrine and Government. THis present Synod (being desirous to declare their sincerity and con∣stancie in the profession of the Doctrine and Discipline already established in the Church of Eng∣land, and to secure all men against any suspition of revolt to Pope∣rie, or any other superstition) decrees that all Arch-bishops, and Bishops, and all other Priests and Deacons in places xempt or not exempt, shall
before the second day of November next ensuing take this Oath following against all Innovation of Doctrine or Discipline, and this Oath shall be ten∣dred them, and every of them, and all others na∣med after in this Canon, by the Bishop in person, or his Chancelour, or some grave Divines named and appointed by the Bishop under his seal; and the said Oath shall be taken in the presence of a pub∣lique Notarie, who is hereby rquired to make an Act of it, leaving the Universities to the Provision which followes. The Oath is: I A. B. Do swear, That I do ap∣prove the Doctrine and Discipline or Government established in the Church of England, as containing all things necessary to salvation: And that I will not endeavour by my self or any other, directly or indirectly, to bring in any Popish Doctrine, contrary to that which is so esta∣blished: Nor will I ever give my consent to altr the Government of this Church, by Arch-bishops, Bishops, Deanes, and Arch-deacons, &c. as it stands now established, and as by right it ought to stand, nor yet ever to
subject it to the usurpations and superstitions of the Sea of Rome. And all these things I do plainly and sincerely acknowledge and swear, according to the plain and common sence and understanding of the same words, without any equivocation, o mentall eva∣sion, or secret rservation whatsoever. And this I do heartily, willingly, and truely, upon the faith of a Christian. So help me God, in Jesus Christ. And if any man Beneficd or Dignified in the Church of England, or any othr Ecclesiasticall pr∣son shall refuse to take this Oath, the Bishop shall give him a moneths time to inform himslf, and at the moneths end, if he refuse to take it, he shall be suspended ab Officio, and have a second moneth granted: and if then he refuse to take it, he shall b suspended ab Ofiio & Beneficio, and have a third moneth granted him for his better information: but if at the end of that moneth he refuse to take the Oath above-named, he shall by the Bishop be deprived of all his Ecclsiasticall Promotions what∣soever, and execution of his function which he holds in the Church of England. And we likewise Constitute and Ordain, That all Masters of Arts (the sons of Noble-men onely excepted) all Bachelours and Doctors in Divinity, Law, or Physick, all that are licenced to practise
Physick, all Registers, Actuaries, and Proctors, all School-masters, all such as being natives or natu∣ralized, do come to be incorporated into the Uni∣versities here, having taken a Degree in any forraign Univesity, shall be bound to take the said Oath. And we command all Governours of Colledges and Halls in either of the Universities, that they admi∣nister this said Oath to all persons resident in their severall Houses that have taken the degrees before mentioned in this Canon, within six moneths after the publication hereof. And we likewise Constitute, That all Bishops shall be bound to give the said Oath unto all those to whom they give holy Orders, at the time of their Ordination, or to whomsoever they give Col∣lation, Institution, or Licence to Preach, or serve any Cure. VII. A Declaration concerning some Rites and Ceremonies. BEcause it is generally to be wish∣ed, that unity of Faith were ac∣companied with uniformity of practis, in the outward worship and service of God; chiefly for the avoiding of groundlesse su∣spitons of those who are weak,
and the malicious aspersions of the professed ene∣mies of our Religion; the one fearing Innovations, the other flattering themselves with a vain hope of our backslidings unto their Popish superstition, by reason of the situation of the Communion Table, and the approaches thereunto, the Synod decla∣reth, as followeth That the standing of the Communion Table, side-way under the East window of every Chancell, or Chappell, is in its own nature indifferent, neither commanded nor condemned by the Word of God, either expresly, or by immediate deduction, and therefore that no Religion is to be placed therein, or scruple to be made thereon. And albeit at the time of reforming this Church from that grosse su∣perstition of Popery, it was carefully provided that all meanes should be used to root out of the mindes of the people, both the inclination thereunto, and memory therof; especially of the Idolatry commit∣ted in the Masse, for which cause all Popish Altars were demolished: yet notwithstanding it was then ordered by the Injunctions and Advertisements of Queen Elizabeth, of blessd memory, that the holy Tables should stand in the place where the Altars stood, and accordingly have been continued in the Royall Chappells of three famous and pious Prin∣ces, and in most Cathedrall, and some Parochiall Churches, which doth sufficiently acquit the man∣ner of placing the said Tables from any illegality, or just suspition of Popish superstition or innovation. And therefore we judge it fit and convenient, that
all Churches and Chappels do conform themselves in this particular, to the example of the Cathedral, or Mother Churches, saving alwaies the generall liber∣ty left to the Bishop by Law, during the time of Administration of the holy Communion. And we declare that this situation of the holy Table, doth not imply that it is, or ought to be esteemed a true and proper Altar, whereon Christ is again really sacrificed: but it is, and may be called an Altar by us, in that sense in which the Primitive Church called it an Altar, and in no other. And because experience hath shewed us, how ir∣reverent the behaviour of many people is in many plac, some leaning, others casting their hats, and some sitting upon, some standing, and others sitting under the Communion Table in time of Divine Service: for the avoiding of these and the like abus, it is thought meet and convenient by this present Synod, that the said Communion Tables in all Chancells or Chappells, be decently severed with Rails to preserve them from such or worse profanations. And because the Administration of holy things is to be performed with all possible decency and reverence, thereore we judge it fit and convenient, according to the word of the Service-Book esta∣blished by Act of Parliament, Draw neer, &c. that all Communicants with all humble reverence shall draw neer and approach to the holy Table, there to receive the divine Mysteries, which have heretofore in some places been unfitly carried up and down by
the Minister, unlesse it shall be otherwise appointed in respect of the incapacity of the place, or other in∣convenience by the Bishop himself in his jurisdicti∣on, and other Ordinaries respectively in theirs. And lastly, whereas the Church is the house of God, dedicated to his holy worship, and therefore ought to minde us, both o the greatnesse and good∣nesse of his Divine Majestie, certain it is that the acknowledgement thereof, not onely inwardly in our hearts, but also outwardly with our bodies, must needs be pious in it self, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others. We therefore think it very meet and behoovefull, and heartily commend it to all good and well affected people, members of this Church, that they be ready to tender unto the Lord the said acknowledgement, by doing reve∣rence and obeisance, both at their coming in, and going out of the said Churches, Chancels, or Chappels, according to the most ancient custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also for many yeers of the Reign of Quen Elizabeth. The reviving therefore of this ancient and ladable custome, we heartily com∣mend to the serious considration of all good peo∣ple, not with any intention to exhibite any Religi∣ous worship to the Communion Table, the East, or Church, or any thing therein contained in so do∣ing, or to perform the said gesture, in the celebrati∣on of the holy Euchaist, upon any opinion of a cor∣porall pesence of the body of Jesus Christ, on the holy Table, or in te mysticall elements, but onely
for the advancement of Gods Majestie, and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him, and no otherwise; and in the practise or omission of this Rite, we desire that the rule of Charity prescribed by the Apostle, may be obser∣ved, which is, That they which use this Rite despise not them who use it not, and that they who use it not, condemn not those that use it. VIII. Of Preaching for Conformity. WHeras the Preaching of Order and Decencie, according to St Pauls rule, doth conduce to edification; it is required, that all Preachers (as well Beneficd men as others) shall positively and plainly Preach and Intruct the people in their publike Sermons twice in the yeer at the least, that the Rites and Ceremo∣nies now established in the Church of England are lawfull and commendable, and that they the said people and others, ought to conform themselves in their practise to all the said Rites and Ceremonies, and that the people and others ought willingly to submit themselves unto the authority and govern∣ment of the Church as it is now established under the Kings Majestie. And if any Preacher shall
refuse or neglect to do according to this Canon, let him be suspended by his Ordinary, during the time of his refusall, or wilfull forbearance to do there∣after. IX. One Book of Articles of inquiry to be used at all Parochiall Visitations. FOr the better settling of an Unifor∣mity in the outward government and administration of the Church, and for the more preventing of just grievances which may be laid upon Church-wardens and other Sworn-men, by any impertinnt, inconvenient, or illegall enquiries in the Articles for Ecclesiasticall Vi∣sitations; This Synode hath now causd a Sum∣mary or Collection of Visitory Articles (out of the Rubricks of the Service-Book, and the Canons and warrantable Rules of the Church) to be made, and for future direction to be deposited in the Re∣cords of the Arch-bishop of Canterbury: and we do decree and ordain, that from henceforth no Bishop or other person whatsoever having right to hold, use, or exercise any Parochiall Visitation, shall (un∣der the pain of a Moneths suspension upon a Bi∣shop, and two Moneths upon any other Ordinary that is delinquent, and this to be incurred ipso facto) cause to be printed or published, or otherwise to be
given in charge to the Church-warden, or to any other persons which shall be sworn to make Pre∣sentmnts, any other Articles or formes of enquiry upon oath, then such onely as shal be approved and in terminis allowed unto him (upon due request made) by his Metropolitan under his Seal of Office. Provided alwaies that after the end of three yeers next following the date of these presents, the Metro∣politan shal not either at the instance of those which have right to hold Parochiall Visitations, o upon any other occasion, make any addition or diminu∣tion from that allowance to any Bishop, of Visita∣tory Articles, which he did last before (in any Dio∣cesse, within his Province) approve of; But cal∣ling for the same shall hold and give that onely for a perpetual Rule, and then evey Paish shalbe bound onely to take the said Book from the Arch-dea∣cons and other having a Peculiar or exempt Juris∣diction, but once from that time, in three yeers, in case they do make it appear that they have the said Book remaining in their publike Chst for the use of the Parish: And from evry Bishop they shall re∣ceive the said Articles at the Episcopall Visitation onely, and in manner and form as formerly they have been accustomed to do, and at no greater price then what hath bin usually paied in the said Dio∣cesse respectively.
X. Concerning the Conversation of the Clergie. THe sober, grave and exemplary Conversation of al those that are imployed in Administration of holy things, being of great avail for the furtherance of pietie It hath ben the Religious care of the Church of England, strictly to enjoyn to all & every one of her Clergie, a pious, regular, and inoffensive dmeanour and to prohibit all loose and scanda∣lous carriage by severe censures to be inflicted upon such delinquents, as appeares by the 74. and 75. Canons Anno 1603. provided to this purpose. For the more ffectuall successe of which pious and necessary care, this present Synode, straitly charges all Cleargie men in this Church, that setting before their yes the glory of God, the holinsse of their calling, and the edification of the people committed to them, they carefully avoid all excesse and disorder, aud that by their Christian and Reli∣gious conversation they shine forth as lights unto others in all godlinesse and honesty. And we also require all those to whom the Go∣vernment of the Clergie of this Church is com∣mitted, that they set themselves to countenance and encourage godlinesse, gravitie, sobrietie, and all un∣blameable conversation in the Ministers of this
Church, and that according to the power with which they are intrusted, they diligently labour by the due execution of the above named Canons, and all other Ecclesiasticall provisions made for this end, to reform all offensive and scandalous per∣sons, if any be in the Ministerie, as they tender the welfare and prospering of Pietie and Religion, and as they will answer to God for those scandals, which through their remisnesse and neglect shall arise and grow in this Church of Christ. XI. Chancellours Patents. FOr the better remedying and re∣dresse of such abuses as are com∣plained of in the Ecclesiasticall Courts, the Synode doth De∣cree and ordain, that hereafter no Bishop shall Graunt any Pa∣tent to any Chancllour, Com∣missarie, or Officiall, for any longer terme, then the life of the Grauntee onely, nor otherwise then with expresse reservation to himself, and his Successours, of the power to execute the said place, either alone, or with the Chancellour, if the Bishop shall please to do the same, saving alwayes to the said Chancel∣lors, &c. the Fees accustomably taken for executing the said jurisdiction. And that in all such Patents, the Bishop shall keep in his own hands the power of Institution unto Benefices, as also of giving Li∣censes
to preach or keep school; And further, that no Deane and Chapter confirme any Patent of any Chancellour, Commissaries, or Officials place, wherein the said conditions are not expressed sub pona suspensionis, to the Deane (or his locum tenens if he passe the Act in his absence) and to every Ca∣non, or Prebendary, voting to the confirmation of the said Act, to be inflicted by the Arch-bishop of the Province. And further, the holy Synode doth decree and ordain that no reward shall be taken for any Chancellours, Commissaries or Officials place under the heaviest Censures of the Church. XII. Chancellours alone not to Censure any of the Clergie in sundry Cases. THt no Chancellour, Commissarie, or Of∣ficiall, unlesse he be in holy Orders, shall proceed to Suspension, or any higher Censure against any of the Clergie in any criminall cause, other then neglect of appearance, upon legall citing, but that all such causes shall be heard by the Bishop in person, or with the assistance of his Chancellour, or Commissarie; or if the Bi∣shops occasions will not permit, then by his Chan∣cellour, or Commissarie, and two grave dignified, or benficed Ministers of the Diocesse to be assigned by the Bishop, under his Episcopall seal, who shall hear and censure the said cause in the Consistorie.
XIII. Excommunication and absolution not to be pro∣nounced but by a Priest. THat no excommunications or ab∣solutions shall be good or valid in Law, except they be pronoun∣ced, either by the Bishop in per∣son, or by some other in holy Or∣ders, having Ecclesiasticall juris∣diction, or by some grave Minister beneficed in the Diocesse, being a Master of Arts, at least, and appointed by the Bishop, and the Priests name pronouncing such sentence of excom∣munication, or absolution to be expressed in the In∣strument issuing under seal out of the Court. And that no such Minister shall pronounce any sentence of absolution but in open Consistory, or at the least in a Church or Chappell, the penitent humbly cra∣ving and taking absolution upon his knees, and ha∣ving first taken the Oath, De parendo juri & stando mandatis Ecclesiae. And that no Parson, Vicar, or Cu∣rate, sub poena suspensionis, shall declare any of his or their Parishioners to be excommunicate, or shall admit any of them so excommunicate into the Church, and there declare them to be absolved, ex∣cept they first receive such excommunications and absolutions under the seal of the Ecclesiasticall Judge, from whom it cometh.
XIIII. Concerning Commutations, and the dispo∣sing of them. THat no Chancellor, Commissary, or Officiall, shall have power to commute any penance in whole, or in part; but either together with the Bishop in person, or with his privity in writing, or if by himself, there he shall give up a full and just account of all such Commutations once every yeer, at Michaelmas to the Bishop, who shall with his Chancellor, see that all such moneyes be disposed of to charitable and publike uses, ac∣cording to Law. And if any Chancellor or other, having jurisdiction, as aforesaid, shall not make such a just account to the Bishop, and be found guil∣ty of it, he shall be suspended from all exercise of his jurisdiction, for the space of one whole yeer. Alwayes provided, that if the crime be publikely complained of, and do appear notorious, that then the Office shall signifie to the place, from whence the complaint came, that the delinquent hath satis∣fied the Church for his offence. And the Minister shall signifie it as he shall be directed; saving al∣wayes to all Chancellers, and other Ecclesiasticall Officers their due and accustomable fees, if he or they be not so suspended as aforesaid.
XV. Touching concurrent Iurisdictions. THat in such places wherein there is concurrent Jurisdiction, no Executor be cited into any Court or Office, for the space of ten dayes after the death of the Testator. And that aswell every Apparitor herein, as every Register, or Clark that giveth or carrieth out any Citation or Pro∣cesse to such intent, before that the said ten dayes be expired, shall for the first Offence herein, be suspended from the execution of his Office, for the space of three Moneths; and for the second Offence, in this kinde, be and stand excommuni∣cated, ipso facto, not to be restored, but by the Metropolitan of the Province, or his lawfull Sur∣rogate; And that yet neverthelesse, it be lawfull for any Executor, to prove such Wills when they thinke good, within the said ten dayes, before any Ecclesiasticall Judge respectively, to whose jurisdiction the same may, or doth appertaine.
XVI. Concerning Licences to Marrie. WHereas divers Licences to Marry, are granted by Ordinaries, in whose Ju∣risdiction, neither of the parties, de∣siring such Licence, is resident; to the prejudice of the Archiepiscopall prerogative: to whom only the power of grant∣ing such Licences, to parties of any Jurisdiction, per totam provinciam, by Law belongeth; and for other great inconvniences thereupon ensuing. It is therefore decreed, That no Licence of Mar∣riage shall be granted by any Ordinary to any parties, unlesse one of the said parties have beene commorant in the Jurisdiction of the said Ordin∣ry, for the space of one whole Moneth, imme∣diately before the said Licence be desired. And if any Odinary shall offend herein, and be suffici∣enly evinced thereof, in any of the Lord Arch∣bishops Courts, he shall be liable to such censure as the Lord Archbishop shall thinke fit to inflict. And we further decree, That one of the Conditi∣ons in the Bond of securitie given by the parties taking such Licence, shall be, that the said partie, or one of them, have, or hath beene a Moneth commorant in the said Jurisdiction, immediately before the said Licence granted. And the Synod decrees, That whatsoever is
ordered in these six last Canons, concerning the Jurisdiction of Bishops, their Chancellors, and Commissaries, shall (so farre as by Law is ap∣plyable) be in force, concerning all Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Collegiate Churches, Archdeacons, and all in holy Orders, having ex∣empt, or peculiar Jurisdiction, and their severall Officers respectively. XVII. Against vexatious Citations. AND that this Synod may prevent all grievances, which may fall upon the people by Citations into Eccle∣siasticall Courts, upon pretence on¦ly of the breach of Law, without either Pesentment, or any other just ground. This present Synod decrees, That for all times to come no such Citation, grounded only as afore∣said, shall issue out of any Ecclesiasticall Court, except the said Citation be sent forth under the hand and Seale of the Chancellor, Commissarie, Archdeacon, or other competent Jdge of the said Court, within thirty dayes afer the fault committed; and returne thereof to be mde the next, or second Court day after the Citation ser∣ved at the farthest; and that the partie so cited, unlsse he be convinced by two witnesses, shall,
upon the denyall of the fact upon Oath, be forth∣with freely dismissed without any payment of fees; Provided that this Decree exed not to any gievous crime, as Schisme, Incontinencie, mis∣behaviour in the Church in time of Divine Ser∣vice, obstinate inconformitie, or the like. WEE of Our Princely inclination and Royall care for the maintenance of the present Estate and government of the Church of England by the Lawes of this Our Realme now setled and established, having diligently, with great contentment and comfort read and considered of all these their said Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions agreed upon, as is before expressed: And finding the same such as We are perswaded wilbe very profitable, not onely to Our Clergie, but to the whole Church of this Our Kingdome, and to all the true members of it (if they be well observed;) Have therefore for Vs, Our Heires, and lawfull Successours, of Our especiall grace, certaine knowledge, and
meere motion, given, and by these presents doe give Our Royall Assent, according to the forme of the said Statute or Act of Parliament afore∣said, to all and every of the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions, and to all and eve∣ry thing in them contained, as they are before written.

And that likewise for the bet∣ter observation of them, every Minister, by what ame or title soever he be called, shall in the Pa∣rish
Church or Chappell where he hath charge, read all the said-Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitutions, at all such times, and in such man∣ner as is prescribed in the said Canons, or any of them: The Book of the said Canons to be pro∣vided at the charge of the Parish, betwixt this and the Feast of S. Michael the Archangell next ensuing, straightly charging and comman∣ding all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other that exercise any Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction within this Realme, every man in his place to see and procure (so much as in them lyeth) all and every of the ame Canons, Orders, Ordinances and Constitu∣tions to be in all points duly observed, not sparing to execute the penalties in them severally menti∣oned, upon any that shall wittingly or wilfully break or neglect to observe the same; as they tender the honour of God, the peace of the Church, the tranquillity of the Kingdome, and their du∣ties and service to Vs their King and Sove∣reigne.
