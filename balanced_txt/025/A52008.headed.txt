THE Church-Catechism ENLARG'D and EXPLAIN'D, IN AN Easie and Familiar METHOD, WITH THE SCRIPTURE-PROOFS Annexed thereunto. These words which I command thee this day shall be in thine Heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up. Deut. 6.7, 8. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Parkhurst, at the Bible and Three Crowns, at the lower end of Cheapside, near Mercers Chappel. 1697.
THE PREFACE. THIS explication of the Catechism supposeth the Reader to be convinc'd of the necessity and excellency of the Duty of Catechizing; and the great danger of the neglect thereof, in Churches or Familys where there are any that need training up in the way that they should go. I am not ignorant that there are many who have written ex∣cellently on the Catechism; and no wonder, when so much of every Ministers time is or ought to be taken up in the use of it. But yet there are not many that have made use of this Method; The first Designer of it, being taken away, as is said in his life, before He had accomplish't what He intended, was followed by Doctor Wallis upon another Catechism: Doctor Comber, and (I think) He a∣lone followed him upon this: yet He by designing so much brevity and altogether omitting the Scripture proofs hath left room for a further Essay. The use of this Mothod is double. (1.) As to the meanest capacitys it hath a visible benefit, in that the Question is so fram'd as to lead the person instructed to his Answer, whereby his under∣standing is both try'd and inform'd and yet the memory not bur∣den'd with words; it being evident that many of the more care∣less sort are frighted from the Catechism by a long Answer impos'd upon the memory: and others get words by vote which they under∣stand not and presently singer. I only here desire of the Teacher, that when He propounds or as be any Question, He would not ex∣press or recite the Text or Texts of Scripture annexed thereunto; partly because these proofs do indeed belong to the Answer, and not to the Question, though they could not conveniently be places
otherwise than they are; and partly, because such a recital of the Texts, Chapter and Verse would make the Question so long as to hinder the attention of the Learner: great care being to be taken that He Answers understandingly, and not by ghess, Yes or No: and for that reason He may sometimes be required to repeat the mat∣ter of the Question in his Answer; as Q. Are there more Gods than One? A. No, there are not more Gods than One. (2.) The other use is for them that have more understanding, who must be obliged to answer to the Question, by the Scripture annexed; in this manner. Q. Are there more Gods than One? A. No. Q. How prove you that? A. From Deut. 6.4. Hear O Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord, and I think, it cannot be deny'd, that the best as well as easiest way of Learning Scripture-principles is in Scripture Phrase. Those lively Oracles make a deeper and more abiding impression than any other words: And the prudent Catechist may with his Pen mark in every Section such Texts for the Learner to recite at a time as He shall judge for plainness or number to be suited to his Capacity. Nor will this hinder the Learning these Principles in distinct pro∣positions as they are set down in other Catechisms; but will make it far more easie to Learn the words, when they are by this in∣structed beforehand in the matter therein contain'd. In this Composure I have endeavoured to make the Questions very Comprehensive, by crowding thereinto as much matter, as would consist with the plainness that I studiously design'd: so that there is enough in each Question, especially when the proof is given in Answer, for the Catechist to dilate and enlarge upon, in his more Familiar Instructing of those committed to his Charge. May the whole be for the Glory of God through Christ, and for the Edification of his Flock, particularly the Lambs therein. R. M.
A CATECHISM: That is to say, An Instruction to be learned of every Person before He be brought to be Confirmed by the Bishop. Question. WHat is your Name? Answer. N. or M. Question. Who gave you this Name? Answer. By Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a Member of Christ, the Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. §. WAS not your Name given you at your Bap∣tism, as they were wont to receive their Names at their Circumcision? Luke 2.21. Yes.

Secondly, That I should believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith. And Thirdly, That I should keep Gods holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my Life. §.

No. Did they not then in your Name promise, or declare the Vow that you should be bound to perform? Luke 5.18-20. Yes.

No. * May we immoderately or unseasonably seek or affect the riches, honours, or pleasures of the world? 1 Joh. 2.15, 16. No. (3.)

ARE we not to observe in our Baptismal Vow, what we are to believe, as well as what we are to renounce? Yes. 1. Are not the Holy Scriptures, (Acts 24.14.) and particularly the Articles of the Creed, the Doctrinal ob∣ject of our Faith? Joh. 20.31. Yes.

Eph. 1.19. and doth it not work by love and all good fruits? Gal. 5.6. Jam. 2.18. Yes.

Did you promise a sinless Obedience, for the ends of the Covenant of Works? 1 Joh. 1.8, 9. No. But is not sincere Obedience to the will of God de∣clared in his word, indispensably required in the Cove∣nant of Grace? Gal. 6.16. Jam. 1.25. Yes. * Is not this new Obedience from the efficacy of the Spirit, and constraint of Divine Love? 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. Yes. Yet are we forbidden to take Motives of our Obedi∣ence from fear of punishment or hope of reward? Jer. 32.40. No. * Are not the ends of it, that God may be glorify'd. Mat. 5.16. Our Neighbour edify'd. 1 Pet. 3.1, 2. and our Selves made meet for Heaven? Col. 1.12. Yes.

HAVE you considered your Solemn Vow and Promise made in Baptism? Luk. 14.28, 31. Yes. Do you now in the presence of God and this Congre∣gation make a profession of your standing to your Baptis∣mal Covenant? Josh. 24.22, 27. Yes. * You say you will now; but will you make this pro∣fession
in the most difficult and costly circumstances, when the glory of God is concern'd? Rev. 2.3, 4. Yes. * Do you make this profession only for hereafter, without setting about the performance presently? Psal. 119.60. No. You say, you will, but can you do it, in your own strength? 2 Cor. 3.5.

Mat. 22.14. No. But can this outward call be refus'd, without the woful hazard of the Soul? Prov. 1.24, 26. No. §.

Answer. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth: And in Iesus Christ his only Son our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucifyed, dead and buried, he descended into Hell, The third day he rose again from the dead, He ascended into Heaven, And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, From thence he shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, The Holy Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, The forgiveness of Sins, The resurrection of the body, And the life everlasting. Amen. §.

And this I trust He will do of his mercy and goodness, through our Lord Iesus Christ, and therefore I say, Amen. So be it.
§. CAN we aright Petition God for mercy, with∣out Confession of our vileness and unworthiness, and Thanksgiving for what we have received? Dan. 9.4. Col. 4.2.

No. Is it not to unburden our loaded Consciences before the Lord, Psal. 32.4, 5. to acknowledge his justice and to lay hold on his mercy? 1 Joh. 1.9. Yes.

Believers (as Ordination is to Ministers) to which others are not oblig'd? No. * Are they so particularly necessary, to every person under all Circumstances, that no one can be saved that doth not pertake of them? Mat. 9.13. No. Are they not then generally necessary, where they may be had, by vertue of Gods Command, that no one upon peril of his Soul, may wilfully contemn them? Num. 9.13. Yes Question. What meanest thou by this word Sacrament? Answer. I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward Spi∣ritual Grace, given unto us ordain'd, by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof. §. DOTH not the word Sacrament fignify our engagement to Christ, as the Roman Souldiers were to their Emperours by their military Oath? Yes. (1) Can it be a Sacrament, where there is not some outward sign sensible and visible? Rom. 4.11. No. Are not such signs of great use, to inform our under∣standings, quicken our memories, and stir up our affecti∣ons? Gal. 3.1. Yes. (2.)

No. Are the Benefits of Christ's death (though conditio∣nally) offer'd and promised in these rites? Yes. (4.)

Can any meer man ordain a Sacrament or annex Grace or any promise thereof to their own inventions? No. (5.) Must not a Sacrament be a means to receive the Grace promised, Tit. 3.5. and doth not God indeed conveigh Grace to the worthy receivers? 1 Cor. 10.16. Yes. Doth the efficacy of the Sacraments depend upon the intention or▪ worthiness of the Person that administers them? 1 Cor. 3.6, 7. No.
Do the Sacraments work of themselves, by any Natu∣ral vertue in the outward rites? 1 Pet. 3.21. No. Are they not means of Grace made effectual by the working of the Spirit to them that by Faith do pertake of them? 1 Cor. 12.13. Yes. (6.) Can there be any Sacrament, where there is not a Seat or pledge to assure this to us? Rom. 4.11. No. Do not Believers in the Sacraments Seal their Cove∣nant with God, Psal. 50.5. and receive the Benefits of the new Covenant Seal'd to them? Rom. 15.8. Yes. Question. How many parts are there in a Sacrament? Answer. Two. The outward visible sign and the inward Spiritual Grace. §. ARE these the only parts of it; or doth a bare sign of Grace, without a Promise and Institution make a Sacrament? 1 Cor. 16.20. No. Do you not mention these two parts, for the better Explication of each particular Sacrament following? Yes. Question. What is the outward visible sign or Form in Bap∣tism. Answer. Water, wherein the Person is Baptised in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. §. IS not water the Element in which Baptism is ad∣ministred, and was not Christ and his Disciples Baptized therein? Mat. 3.17. Acts 8.36. and 10.44. Yes. May any for the meaness of its outside, or under pre∣tence of a higher Baptism, contemn this? 2 Kings 5.12. No. Can any thing be more apt, to signify the blood and Spirit of Christ, than water; for the necessity, freeness, plety, and the Cleansing. Vertue thereof? Isa. 55.1. Joh. 1.16. No. §. DOTH not Baptizing signify, the application of water to a person or thing in greater or
esser quantities? Mark. 7.4. 1 Cor. 10.2. Yes. Is it probable that when Thousands were Baptized in a day; and some Baptized in private houses, and by night that they were all plung'd under water? No. Doth not the Sprinkling with or pouring on of water aptly express the bloud of sprinkling, Heb. 10.22. and 12.24. and pouring out of the Spirit? Acts 2.17. Yes. §. CAN any administer Baptism but they who are sent and Commissioned, Joh. 1.33. or may they do it in their own names, or the name of any Creature? 1 Cor. 1.13, 15 No. Must it not be in the name of the Trinity, to shew by whose authority it is done, and who alone can make it effectual? Mat. 28 19. Yes. † And is not the person so Baptized engag'd to the Profession and worship of Father, Son and Holy Ghost? Gal. 3.27. Yes. Question. What is the inward and Spiritual Grace? Answer. A death unto Sin, and a new birth unto righteous∣ness; for being by nature born in Sin, and the Chil∣dren of wrath, we are hereby made the Children of Grace. §. IS not the new Birth or Regeneration (which is a Change of State and Heart) signify'd and Sealed in our Baptism? Tit. 3.5. Yes. (1.) Are there any, that (before the relative change by Regeneration) are not by nature Children of Wrath? Eph. 2.3. No. Is not Justification signify'd by Baptism, whereby our Souls are sprinkled with Christs blood, as our bodies are with water? Acts 2.28. and 22.16. Yes. And are not they who are thus justified, accepted as the Children of Grace by adoption. Yes. (2.) Can any have this Relative change, without a real change of Heart and life accompanying it? No. Are there any, that are not by nature born in Sin, and become defiled and unclean thereby? Psal. 51.5. No. Is not Sanctification Seal'd in Baptism, whereby our Souls are cleansed by his Spirit, as by the pouring on of Water? Joh. 3.5. Ezek. 36.25. Yes.
* Is not mortification or a death unto Sin one part of Sanctification? Rom. 6.2, 3. Yes. Can any improve their Baptism aright that do not dye unto sin and dayly mortify their Corruptions? Rom. 6.11. and 8.13. No. And is not this aptly signifyed by pouring Water on the Person Baptized, as we cast dust on a body that is buried? Rom. 6.4. Yes. * Is not vivification or a rising again unto righteous∣ness, the other part of Sanctification, and signify'd by coming from under the water of Baptism? Rom. 6.4 Yes. † But though this be the inward Grace signify'd and Sealed by Baptism, yet is this Change wrought meerly by the outward washing? 1 Pet. 3.21. No. Question. What is required of Persons to be Baptized? Answer. Repentance, whereby they forsake Sin, and Faith, whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that Sacrament. §. IS Baptism to be administred to any Creatures save the Children of Men, or to any of them that are out of the visible Church? No. Is it not to be administred to all within the Church, without distinction of Nation, Sex, or Condition? Gal. 3.28. Yes. May any Adult Person be admitted to Baptism with∣out Profession of Faith and Repentance, Mark 1.15. or can they receive any saving benefit without those Graces? Acts 2.38, 41. No. (1.) Is there not in repentance a deep sense of Sin, Confession of it to God, with shame, hatred, and sor∣row for it? Luk. 18.13. Yes. Yet is all this sufficient without forsaking or re∣nouncing Sin, in Heart and Life, and turning from it to the Lord? Isa. 55.7. No. And is not such a repentance one thing that is re∣quired of Persons that are to be Baptized? Mat. 3.6. Yes. (2.) Are we not to believe the promises of justifying and Sanctifying Grace, made in the new Covenant, and signifyed and Sealed in Baptism? Ezek. 36.25, 26. Heb. 11.13. Yes.
Are there any such promises without respect to Christ, or can we stedfastly believe them without Faith in Jesus Christ, in and through whom they are esta∣blished? 2 Cor. 1.20. No. And is not such a faith the other thing that is requi∣red of Persons that are to be Baptized? Acts 8.37. Yes. Question. Why then are Infants Baptized, when by reason of their tender Age they cannot perform them? Answer. Because they promise, them both by their sureties; which promise when they come to Age, themselves are bound to perform. §. WERE you capable of performing these when you were Baptized in Infancy, as you might have been, if you had been Baptized at Age? No. Is then the Baptism of Infants to be retained in the Church, and was our Baptism, in that tender Age, Lawful? Yes. * If God extends his Covenant to the seed of Be∣lievers, Acts 2.38, 39. may any deny them a Right to the Seal of that Covenant? Gen. 17.7-10. No. Is not the blessing of Abraham come upon the Gentiles, Gal. 3.14. and are not we graffed into the same Church that the Jews were broken off from? Rom. 11.17. Yes.

No. Are not the Infants of Believers faederally Holy, Rom. 11.16. 1 Cor. 7.14. own'd as Covenant-servants, Levit. 25.41, 42. and received as Disciples? Mat. 10.42. Mark. 10.14. Yes. * Was it not the Will of Christ, who is King of Kings, that whole Nations should be discipled and Baptized? Mat. 28.19. Yes. Are Infants deny'd to be a part of Nations, or are they deny'd Birth-priviledges amongst Men? Acts 22.28. No. * Doth not the Practice of the Universal Church in all Ages, agree to this and Confirm it? Acts 16.15, 33. Yes. §. IF Infants they do not actually repent and believe, yet are they capable of coming under a promise
or engagement so to do? Deut. 29.10-12. No. Though your engagement and promise was then declar∣ed by others, yet can you lay claim to the Benefits of the Covenant without standing to that engagement your selves? No. And now you are come to Age, do you not renew your Baptismal engagement, and are you not desirous to be Confirmed therein by laying on of hands and Prayer? Heb. 6.2. Yes. Question. Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper or∣ain'd? Answer. For the continual remembrance of the Sacrifice of the Death of Christ, and of the benefits which we re∣ceive thereby. §. IS not the Lords Supper the other Sacrament and was it not Ordained by Christ, as well as Baptism? 1 Cor. 11.23. Yes. Was it Ordained, to be an unbloody Sacrifice or pro∣pitiation for the Quick and the Dead? Heb. 9.22, 25. No. Yet is it not an Eucharist, or Spiritual Sacrifice of Thanksgiving and Gospel Service? Mala. 1.11. Yes. * Was not the death of Christ such a Propitiatory Sa∣crifice Typifyed by all the bloody Sacrifices of Old? Heb. 9.13, 14. Yes. Did He not bear the punishment of our iniquities, Isa. 53.6. and by shedding his blood make Atonement for them? Rom. 3.23. Yes. Are not reconciliation, Rom. 5.1. Sanctification, Heb. 10.10. and Salvation, Rom. 5.9. the Benefits which Be∣lievers receive by his death? Yes. * Is it a small Mercy to have a memorial or remem∣brance of Christs death, when we are so apt to forget it? Luk. 22.19. No. Must we not remember his death, as a History to im∣prove our knowledge; as a Gospel to increase our Faith; and as an Example to promote our Patience? Gal. 3.1. Yes. Is a bare Remembrance sufficient, that is not affecti∣onate, fiducial and operative? 1 Cor. 10.16, 17. No.
* Is it sufficient that we Remember him in this Ordi∣nance, once in our Lives or once in the Year? No. Must it not be a continual Remembrance, as often as we have opportunity, as we go often to our food? 1 Cor. 11.25, 26. Yes. Is this Ordinance Temporary to give place to others, as the Jewish Sacraments were? Heb. 9.10. No. Will it be continual and remain in the Church till Christ comes to Judgment? 1 Cor. 11.26. Yes. Question. What is the outward part, or Sign in the Lords supper? Answer. Bread and Wine, which the Lord hath Commanded to be received. §. CAN Bread be more necessary to the Body, Levit. 26.26. than Christ is to the Life of the Soul? Joh. 6.33.57. No. Can Wine be more suited to the thirst, than Christ is to the desires of a Believer? Joh. 4.14. No. * Are not Bread and Wine most perfect in their Kind, Psal. 104.15. and apt to signifie a perfect Saviour?

Yes. * Doth not the breaking the bread and pouring out the Wine aptly Represent the torturing his body and shedding his bloud? 1 Cor. 11.24. Yes. * Can we have Life by Christ without Believing any more than our Natural Life can be maintained without Eating and Drinking? Habak. 2.4. No. §. HATH Christ who Commanded us to receive the Elements, bid us to lay them up, carry them a∣bout in procession, or to adore them? No. Is it sufficient to receive one of these Elements with∣out the other, when Christ has Commanded both to be re∣ceived? Mat. 26.27. No. Question. What is the imward part or thing signify'd? Answer. The Body and blood of Christ, which are verily and
indeed taken and received by the Faithful in the Lords supper. §. WHEN we are pertakers of Christs bloody death and the Benefits thereby are we not said to receive his Body and Blood, or to eat his Flesh and drink his Blood? Joh. 6.56. Yes. * Is this done after a Corporal or Carnal manner, as the Jews of Old and Papists now understand it? Joh. 6.52. No. Are we to believe that the Substance of the Bread and Wine is changed into the Substance of Christs Bo∣dy and Blood? No. Can we deny our Senses, without destroying the Foundation of our Faith in Christ's Resurrection and miracles? Luk. 24.39. No. Is it Rational to Believe, that our Lord eat his Natu∣ral Body with his own mouth, or that a true body can be whole in ten Thousand places at once? Joh. 6.61, 62. No. Is Not that which we eat and drink in the Sacrament called Bread and Wine after Consecration? 1 Cor. 11.26. Yes. * Is then the receiving Christs body and blood a Phan∣tastical thing, done only in Imagination and Pretence? No. Do we verily and indeed pertake thereof in a Spiritual manner and by Faith? Joh. 6.63. Yes. * Is this done by wicked and ungodly men, or by any but the Faithful or true Believers? Joh. 6.54 —56. No. Question. What are the Benefits, whereof we are made per∣takers thereby? Answer. The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the Body and Blood of Christ, as our Bodies are by the Bread and Wine. §. IS not the Lords Supper compar'd to a Feast, 1 Cor. 5.7, 8. wherein the Benefits of Christs Death are the dainties, set forth by their excellency and variety? Isa. 25.6. Yes. * Can the bodies of men be more Strengthned at a Feast, than the Souls of Believers are Strengthned at the Lords Table? Psal. 138.3. No.
