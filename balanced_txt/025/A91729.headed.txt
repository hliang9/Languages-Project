Precepts for Christian pra∣ctice, or the Rule of the new CREATƲRE. Dutie 1. 1. BE alwayes sensible of thy originall corruption, and consider how it inclineth thee continually to all evill, and indisposeth thee to any good; groane under it, and bewaile it, as Paul did, Rom. 7.24. Also take speciall notice of your actuall sins, or daily infirmities, in thought, word, deed. In∣deavour to make your peace with God for them before you go to bed: which must bee done these foure waies. 1. By repenting and confessing your sinnes to God, working your heart to griefe and sor∣row for them, by some such melting considera∣tions as these. First, of Gods goodnesse to you. 2. Of the unreasonablenesse and every way unprofitablenesse of sin. 3. Of the great pre∣judice and damage that commeth to the soule by sinne. John, 1.1, 9. 2. By beleeving, and casting your self whol∣ly
on Christs righteousnesse for remission of sinne, and for reconciliation with God, Rom. 3.22, 24, 25. 3. By cleaving to Gods promises of pardon, and peace, Isaiah, 43.25. Rom. 5.1. 4. By waiting till the Lord shall speake to you, Psal. 85.8. Dutie 2. Get your union with Christ, and interest in Christ cleered and confirmed to you daily more and more, that you are a branch in his vine, and a member in his body, 2 Cor. 13.5. This may be done three wayes. 1. By daily renewall of your faith in Christ, especially of that act of faith, whereby the soule knits, or tyes it selfe unto Christ, casts, or roules it selfe on Christ for salvation. Cause your heart in a solemne manner every day to act this part, or to put forth this primitive act of faith in the view of the whole soule. The daily exercise hereof will increase, & strengthen the divine habit of faith in the soule, and make the soule sensible of the very act of it. By frequent beleeving you shall feele at your very heart, that you do beleeve; so shall you have a witnesse in your selfe, that you are in Christ, 1 Joh. 5.10. 2. By examining your heart upon what grounds you take Christ to be yours. The grounds are these five; 1. A sight and sense of
of your sins, as of the guilt, power, and punish∣ment of them, and of your misery by them, Mat. 9.13. 2. Your want of Christ seene, and felt at your very heart, to justifie, sanctifie, redeeme, and save you, else you are utterly lost, and undone everlastingly, Luke 19.10. 3. Gods free and generall offer of Christ to any that will take him by faith, John 3.16. there are manifold promises to this purpose: And the grounds of all Gods offers and donations of Christ to the poore soule are free grace, rich mercy, undeserved love, Ephes. 2.4, 5, 7. Tit. 3.4, 5, 6. 4 Christs sweet and gracious invi∣tation of such to come to him as are weary of sin, Matth. 11.28. to buy, as have no money, Isaiah 55.1. no worth, or desert in them∣selves. 5. As sinfull vile wretches as you are, have been sought of Christ, and found in Christ, as 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. 1 Tim. 1.13. Paul was a blasphemer, persecuter, and yet ob∣tained mercy, and therfore why may not you? Thus the more cleerely you discerne upon what grounds you take Christ, the more cleare is your title to Christ, evinced to your owne soule. 3. By surveying and observing in what manner you take Christ daily. Which is, whe∣ther, First, you do wholly renounce all opini∣on and conceit of your owne righteousnesse and desert, Mark 8.34. Phil. 3.7, 8, 9. so that
you come to Christ empty of your selfe, very vile, yea, nothing in your owne eyes, unwor∣thy to receive him. 2. Whether you lay hold on Christ alone with an empty hand of faith, joy∣ning nothing at all with Christ in the mat∣ter of salvation; as the holy Martyr at the stake cried out, None but Christ, None but Christ. 3. Whether you find the Father drawing your heart after Christ, Joh. 6.44. which is in hungring and panting desires, that will never be satisfied without him; so that the streame, both of your Judgement, Phil. 3.7, 8. and affections run towards him, 1 Cor. 2.2. Gal. 6.14. 4. Whether you take Christ as a Lord to rule you, as well as a Jesus to save you, Col. 2.6. As one that is all in all to you, your wis∣dome, your righteousnesse, your sanctification and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30. your spirituall food, John 6.48. your Rayment, Rom. 13.14. your Strength, Phil. 4.13. your life, Gal. 2.20. Col. 3.3. 5. Whether you seeke and waite for Christ, (out of the sense of your spirituall want and penury) in every ordinance publike and pri∣vate, Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Meditation, Conference; not as they are your owne works of sanctification, but as they are Gods Ordi∣nances appointed of purpose for the manifesta∣tion & communication of Christ to the soule.
Frequent perusall hereof will cleare to you your manner of taking Christ, and that will evidence to you your right and title which you have in Christ Jesus. Dutie 3. Labour to draw and derive from Christ (by the powerfull attractive force of faith) spiri∣tuall ability sufficient for the day. 1. To performe all your duties, Phil. 4.13. 2. To exercise all your graces, 2 Cor. 3.5. 3. To resist and overcome all your tentati∣ons and corruptions, Rom. 8.37. 4. To undergoe all your trials, and afflicti∣ons thereof, John 1.16. Make your provision of grace and strength from Christ every morning, fetch from him so much as you shall have occasion to use all day long; yea, and upon all occasions that fall out in the day, goe to Christ still for the wisdome that must direct you, for the holinesse that must character you, for the shoulder which must beare your crosses, for that strength that must resist your tentations, and for abilitie to per∣form all duties as duties. To this end act your faith daily in the pro∣mises of grace, and strength, as John 1.16. Ezek. 36.26, 27. Isaiah 44.3. Zech. 10.12. these and the like promises are security given you by God, that you shall receive grace in the use of the ordinances, which are as the conduit-pipes
or instruments of conveying the same from Christ unto you. This is the way and meanes to doe all in the strength of Christ, and to take forth a great deale of Christ into your soule, that not you, but Christ may live in you, Gal. 2.20. Dutie 4. Perform daily duties both in family, & closet (especially these three, of Prayer, Meditation, Reading) and doe them with serious intention, heate of affection, diligence and delight, Jerem. 48.10. Mal. 1.14. 1 Chron. 21.24. To this end, 1. Watch to these duties, keepe the heart in a good frame for them, undefiled with sin, un∣tainted by the world, Ephes. 6.18. 2. Take the fittest time for the performance of them all; when you are least dull and slug∣gish. Begin the day constantly with thoughts of God, Psal. 57.7, 8, 9. 3. Bee very reall, serious, and substantiall with God in them, indeavour to feele all duties at your heart, inliving, inlarging, inflaming your affections. These be the duties of most importance and consequent, commoditie and comfort to the soule, because they properly aim at, and reach to soules good, and celestiall happinesse, to train up a soule for heaven, Deut. 4.29. Dutie 5. Fortifie your selves every morning against
your speciall lusts to which you are by nature most prone, or shall bee most tempted, bee it pride, passion, convetousnesse, &c. This is done, 1. by Arguments and holy rea∣sonings within your selves, drawn from the sad effects thereof, as disprofit, discomfort, disgrace, or the like, to discover the unreasona∣blenesse of your sins, and make your soule asha∣med of them. For example, shall I bee proud? then I am sure to fall, for pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall, Prov. 16.18. and God will count me for his enemy, for God resisteth the proud, Jam. 4.6. Shall I be angry? if I let passion in, I cannot keepe Satan out, Ephes. 4, 26, 27. Againe, I shall grieve the holy Spirit of God, Ephes. 4.30, 31. Shall I bee covetous? I cannot but bee very sinfull, sith the love of money is the root of all evill, 1 Tim. 6.10. 2. By pondering in your mind upon the precepts in Gods booke against your sins, Prov. 6.23, 24. And on the judgments threatned or inflicted for them; as on proud Herod, Acts 12.23. voluptuous Dives, Luk. 16.23. churlish Na∣bal, 1 Sam. 25.38. 3. By applying promises of mortification close to your hearts, as a plaister to the sore, for subduing your iniquities, Mic. 7.19. Rom. 6.14. 4. By drawing vertue from Christs death into the soule, which hath in it a killing force
of sin, Rom. 6.4.5.6. Phil. 3.10. Dutie 6. Get your hearts strongly fixed on God, by trusting on him, Psal. 112.7. and submitting to him, 2. Sam. 15.26. 1. Sam. 3.18. against all the feares, cares, doubts, trialls, afflictions of every day, for sufficient to the day is the evill thereof, Mat. 6.34. To this end, 1. Be prudent to fore-see your personall tri∣alls, and troubles, whatsoever they are like to bee, Pro. 22.3. 2. Goe hide, and lay up your selfe in God, run unto his name, for God is a rocke of ha∣bitation to which a poore soule may continu∣ally resort, God will give commandment to save him, Psal. 71.3. 1 Peter. 4.19. 3. Especially commit that very thing to God, put into his hands, whatsoever you desire to keepe, or feare to lose, 2. Tim. 1.12. be it life, libertie, name, friends, maintenance, &c. What you would have resolved, if it be a doubt, Psal. 37.5. Or supplied, if it bee a want, Prov. 16.7. Or removed, if it bee a crosse, Psal. 50.5 And to∣gether with the thing, cast all your care, feare, sorrow, and trouble of minde about it wholly on the Lord, Mat. 6.31. 1 Pet. 5.7. Psal. 55.22. 4. Renew your faith in those promises every day which most concern your present estate; as in promises, 1 Of supplies, if you bee in want, Psal. 34.8. & 37.3. & 84.11. Mat. 6.30. 2 Of pro∣tection,
if you be in danger, Psal. 34.7. 3 Of di∣rection, if in doubt, Jam. 1.5. 4 Of deliverance, if in trouble, Job. 5.19. 5 Of a good end, and sanctified use of all. Deut. 8.1. Jam. 5.11. Rom. 8.28. Heb. 12.10. 5. Labour to see Gods hand, Psal. 39.9. be∣leeve his love, Heb. 12.6. Rev. 3.19. and with all meekenesse, and patience to resigne up your selfe wholly to his will in every affliction, Mat. 26.39. Dutie 7. Get, and keepe a savory relish continually of your christian priviledges, wherewith you are invested as you are new creatures in Christ: to wit, 1. Of your dignity, that you are Gods sons, 1 Joh. 3.1, 2. Christ brethren, Heb. 2.11. heavens heires, James. 2.5. partakers of a high, and heavenly calling, Heb. 3.1. 2. Of your liberty, that your are the Lords freemen, Cor. 7.22. delivered out of the hands of all your enemies, 1 Sam. 12.11. 2 Kings. 17.39. 3. Of your victory, that you are through Christ more then Conquerors over all the world of Creatures, 1 John. 5.4. of evils, of temptations, of persecutions, Rom. 8.35.37. 4. Of your safety, that you have almighty God for your place of refuge, Psal. 48.2. a hedge of providence, Job. 1.10. a Guard of an∣gels, Psal. 91.11. an inclosure of mercy, Psal. 32.10.
and Gods promise as a writ of protection for your defence. Heb. 13.5.6. 5. Of your riches as durable substance in heaven, Heb. 10.34. and incorruptible inheri∣tance, 1 Pet. 1.4. a kingdome of glory, and a crowne of life, for you are heires of God, and co-heires with Christ. 6. Of your joy and pleasure, precious for kind, and plentifull for measure, Psal. 16.11. peace un-conceiveable, Phil. 4.7. joy unspeake∣able, 1. Pet. 1.8. the masters joy. Get your hearts affected with all these as be∣ing yours. Chew, and sucke them by serious Meditation, worke, and warme them on your hearts by close application, rubbing them into your affections. Oppose these your spirituall priviledges to all your temporall pressures, set∣ting the one against the other; as your heaven∣ly friends to your earthly foes, your high dig∣nity in Christ to your meaness in outward con∣dition, your wealth above to your want below your future joys and rest to your present trou∣bles, and sorrows. This will make you not onely patient under the afflictions of this life, Rom. 12.12. but also joyful in them, Rom. 5.3. & triumphant over them, 1. Cor. 15.55. Thus did the Apostle, Rom 8.18. 2 Cor 4.17. & 6.8.9.10. These will provoke to duty, 1 Peter. 2.9.11.12. and preserve from faining, 2 Cor. 4.16.17. and from trouble of heart, John. 14.1, 2.
Dutie 8. Sanctifie God in your heart daily, 1 Pet. 1.15. make him your feare, Isaiah. 8.14. your love, & delights, Psal. 37.4. To this end, 1. Have often high, and honorable thoughts of God, serious meditations of his glorious A∣tributes, as his wisdome, power, truth, mercy, Justice, &c. and work them upon your hearts, that they may Eccho to them with pure, and melting affections. This will increase, and nourish up the divine nature in you, 2 Pet. 1.4. 2. Labour to bee affected with all the workes of God, as first to behold, and admire the wis∣dome of God in the creatures, Psal. 136.5. 2 To see, and tast Gods goodnes in every mercy Psal. 34.8. 3 To take notice of, and tremble at the anger, and displeasure of God in all his Judgements, Psal. 119.120. Habb. 3.16. 4 That you may answer the dispensations of Gods providence with sutable dispositions; your hearts carrying a counterpane in affecti∣on to all Gods actions, Isay. 26.8. 3. Wrestle with God by praying, and be∣leeving for an heart of flesh, Ezek. 36.26. which will receive impressions from the very thoughts of God in the mind. 4 Apply promises of particular affections: as first of love, Deut. 30.6. 2 of feare, Ier. 32.40. 3 of delight, Isa. 58.14. There is heart, and life in the se promises, sufficient to quicken and warm thy dead, and frozen affctions.
Dutie 9. Get a publike spirit to mind the things of Jesus Christ, as naturally as if they were your own things, Phil. 2.20, 21. to looke on the things of others, and preferre, first, Jerusalems welfare before your chiefest joy, Psal. 137.5, 6. and 2. the Gospels liberty before your own, as Paul did, and to mourn for the sins of the times, as the Godly in Jerusalem did, Ezek. 9.4. Espe∣cially lay to heart, 1. The Churches misery, when Gods Ordi∣nances goe downe, and superstition goeth up, when Gods cause and side are put to the worst; when any thing falls out, which gives a blow to Religion, or proves an impediment to the Gospel. If the Arke bee taken, call your com∣forts Ichabods, 1 Sam. 4.2. 2. The afflictions of Joseph, Amos 6.6. The sufferings of Gods servants, whether Ministers or people. O sympathize with them, Heb. 13.3. Neb. 1.4. labour to feel their troubles & sorrows at your very hearts; and pray earnestly for them as the Church did for Peter, Act. 12.5. 3. The signes of the times, Mat. 16.3. which hypocrites cannot discerne, though they bee well versed in the face of the Skie, to wit, the sad symptomes, and presages of approaching Judgements, as, First, the commonnesse of sin; for all sorts transgresse in all kind of open sin∣fulnes with a high hand against the light of na∣ture,
and the meanes of grace, Ezek. 12.3. 2 Contempt of Gods Ordinances, misusing of his Ministers, 2 Chron. 36.16. 3 Departure of Gods glory from his house, Ezek. 9.3. 4 In∣corrigibenesse after former, and under present judgements, Lev. 26.14. to the end of the chap∣ter. 5. The death of many righteous men, Isaiah 57.1. the carrying away of others to hiding places. 6 The vials of Gods wrath powred on the Churches beyond the Seas, Ier. 17.12.14. 7 An inundation of spirituall judgements, as a spirit of errour, superstition, apostasie, &c. which do commonly end in tem∣porall plagues, Isa. 6.10, 11. Now the Holy ghost is a publike spirit breathing and acting in all the members of the mysticall body of Christ: Pray for it, Luke 11.13. beleeve for it, Gal. 3.14. Ezek. 36.37. Dutie 10. Get your hearts weaned daily from the world, and from those creatures and comforts in it, which are dearest and sweetest to you. As wife, children, friends, goods, liberty house, life. This Christ requires of those that follow him, Luke 14.26, 27. Mark 10.29, 30. this will pre∣pare you either to suffer or to die when God cals you to it. To this end consider seriously; 1. That these things cannot satisfie your heart, when you have enjoyed them to the full, Eccles. 4.8. & 5.10. you soone grow weary of them, or glutted with them, so that
you desire some new delights, or more of the old, or some over againe. 2. Nor can they sanctifie you, but expose you oft to many lusts, 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. tentations, distractions, to a spirit of the world, and they hinder from following Christ, Mat. 19.22. 3. Nor can they save you from Gods wrath, from death or judgement, Prov. 11.4. 4. The wicked whose portion is onely here, have often the greatest share of them, Psal. 17.14. Job. 21.7. to 14. 5. They serve onely for this life, whilst wee are on this side of the grave; they shall not be the least Ingredients into our celestiall happi∣nes. When we do come to be happy in heaven, wee shall stand in no need of food, rayment, physick, marriage, &c. Mat. 22.30. for we shall be like the Angels of God in heaven, we shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, Rev. 7.16. we shall live by the al-sufficient Spirit of God, which never needs refreshing; we shall be clothed with long white robes of immortality Rev. 7.9. In a word, when wee come to hea∣ven the place of Gods Habitation, wee shall en∣joy the face, and beatificall presence of the most glorious Jehovah, blessed for ever, as an object, wherein all the powers of our soules will be sa∣tisfied with ineffable delight, and everlasting∣nesse. God will be unto us all in all, 1 Cor. 15.28. FINIS.
