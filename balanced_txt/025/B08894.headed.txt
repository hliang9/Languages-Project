To each Gentleman Soldier in the Company of Captain Edward Jenkins, Captain in the Orange Regiment of Trained Bands of the City of LONDON. WHen ancient Rome gain'd the whole Worlds Applause, And gave to Arts and Arms the gen'ral Laws, Her Citizens still bore the greatest share, And were the Strength and Sinews of the War: So our AƲGƲSTA, with her Martial Band, Does in the Gap of Honour always stand; From her Brave Sons each Science does increase; Valiant in War, as Vigilant in Peace. But above all, the ORANGE bears the sway! When she her Gallant Ensigns does Display, The wond'ring Crowd to see the Heroes throng, And praise and bless them as they March along. Each sprightly Youth who is a glad Beholder, Seems Man, and straight desires to be a Soldier. My Captain's Praise I'd gratefully express, Cou'd I in proper terms my self address. Great is my Zeal, but my Performance weak; I may admire, but ne're his Worth can speak. In fine your Foes must all be fill'd with dread, When such Commanders does such Soldiers Lead. Go on, Brave Souls! be Generous and Great; Guard you the City, as That Guards the State. Support her Faith and Faith Defender's Reign: And may Great ORANGE long Our Rights maintain. Your Trusty Marshal, Job Davis.
