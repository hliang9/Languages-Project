ROMES MASTER-PEECE: OR, The Grand Conspiracy of the Pope and his Iesuited Instruments, to extirpate the Pro∣testant Religion, re-establish Popery, subvert Lawes, Liber∣ties, Peace, Parliaments, by kindling a Civill War in Scotland, and all his Majesties Realmes, and to poyson the King himselfe in case hee comply not with them in these their execrable Designes. Revealed out of Concience to Andreas ab Habernfeld, by an A∣gent sent from Rome into England, by Cardinall Barbarino, as an Assistant to Con the Popes late Nuncio, to prosecute this most Execrable Plot, (in which he persisted a principall Actor severall yeares) who discovered it to Sir William Boswell his Majesties Agent at the Hague, 6 Sept. 1640. He, under an Oath of Secre∣sie, to the Arch-bishop of Canterbury (among whose Papers it was casually found by Master Prynne, May, 31. 1643.) who communicated it to the King, As the greatest businesse that ever was put to him. Published by Authority of Parliament. By William Prynne, of Lincolnes Inne, Esquire. 1 COR. 4. 5. The Lord will bring to light the hidden things of Darknesse, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God. It is Ordered by the Committee of the House of Commons in Parliament concerning Printing, this first day of August, 1643. that this Book, Intituled, Romes Master-Peece, be forthwith Printed by Michael Spark, Senior.

TO The Right Honourable ROBERT Earle of WARWICK, Baron of LEEZE, AND LORD ADMIRALL of all the Parliaments Sea Forces. Right Honourable, YOur eminent zealous Sincerity, and incomparable Activity both by Sea and Land in defence of our undermined, endan∣gered Protestant Religion, Lawes, Liberties, Parlia∣ment, Nation, against the many late secret Plots, and open Hostilities of Antichristian Romish Vipers, who for sundry yeares together, have desperately conspired, and most vigorously prosecuted their utter extirpation, and now almost accom∣plished this their infernall Designe, unlesse Gods infinite mercy (which hath never hitherto beene wanting to us in times of greatest extremity) mi∣raculously disappoint it; hath induced me to dedicate this Master-pece of the Romanists, and Jesuites Iniquity, to your most Noble Patronage. Wherein your Lordship may summarily behold the most horrid conspi∣racy against our Reformed Religion, and the very life of the King our So∣veraigne in case he comply not with them (as now alas He doth overmuch in all things) that ever was discovered to the world: and clearly descry, who have beene the reall originall Contrivers, Fomenters of all those late bloody civill warres, which have suddenly transformed our peaceable, plea∣sant delectable Edens of England, Ireland, Scotland, into most desolate ru∣full Acheldamaes, yea Golgothaes, to the just amazement of our selves, and astonishmet of all our Neighbour Nations: who now more lament our present Infelicity, then ever their envied our pristine Tranquility.
It was an admirable act of Divine Providence, that a principall Actor in this Conspiracy, sent from Rome to promote it, should out of remorse of conscience prove the first Revealer of it to Sir William Boswell: But it was a farre more wonderfull hand of God; that after this Plot had been long concealed from publique knowledge by Canterbury, who smothered it; hee should unexpectedly rayse Me up from my forraigne Close Prison of Mount-Orgueil Castle in Jersey, (where Canterbury and his Confe∣derates had intombed me sundry yeares, asPsal. 31. 12. Psal. 88. 4, 5. a dead man out of minde, whom they remembred no more, reputing me among the number of those that go down into the pit, and as one quite cut off by their hands, ne∣ver likely to rise up again till the generall Resurrection;) and not only re∣duce me with Honour and Triumph to my Native Countrey, restore me to my former liberty, and Profession by the Parliaments impartiall Iustice; and make my former and my fellow Sufferers unjust Censures, the ruine of the Sarchamber, Highcommission, and Prelates, who censured us; but like∣wise, beyond all expectation, send this Archprelate (though the Kings chief Favourite) a Prisoner to the Tower of London, to which I was first of all committed by his malice; and employ me to search his Papers there, where he had formerly twice searched mine by his Instruments, and therehy make Me both the Discoverer and Publisher of this second Gunpowder Plot to the world, after a long concealment of it, (and that in a time most seasonable;) which otherwise, in all probability, had never come to light.Rom. 11. 33. O the depth of the Riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! how un∣searchable are his Judgments, and his wayes past finding out! This adorable strange Providence of theDan. 2. 22, 23. God of Heaven, (who revea∣leth the deep and secret things, and knoweth what is in the darknesse, and makes known unto us the Kings matter,) as it should ascertaine us, of his future Protection of our Church and State against these Romish Con∣spirators, whose trayterous Designes hee hath formerly most admirably dis∣covered, and frustrated from time to time; So it should adde much dignity and acceptation to this Discovory, and enlarge our gratulations to God for it. To his Blessing I shall in my Prayers recommend this Master-Piece, to∣gether with your Lordships Person, and all your Heroick Endeavours for our Religions, our Republikes security, and for ever remaine Your Lordships most affectionate Servant William Prynne.
SInce the first Publishing in Print of the ensuing Plot and Letters by Authority and Directions from the House of Commons, which imployed me in this service; I have been credibly informed by some Friends, that many inoredulous, over-su∣spitious Malignants (who think there is as much falshood, dishonesty in others; as in themselves) have questioned the Truth of the ensuing Plot, Letters, Papers; and confidently, if not impudently, averred them to be meere Fictions, without any sha∣dow, proofe, reason, ground at all, but their own malicious misbeliefe. But to satisfie all the world in this Particular, and these slanderous Infidels too, if not rodigiously obstinate: I doe here attest upon the faith and honour of a Christian; First, that I found all these ensuing Letters, Papers in the Archbishop of Canterburies Chamber in the Tower of London under his own custody, when I was unexpectedly employed by the Close Committee, in that undesired service of searching it, which the Archbishop himself, his Servants, the Gentlemen and Souldiers, who then accompanied me, with those who employed me, can witnesse, and have already oft attested. Secondly, that they were all Originals, no Copies, under the severall hands and Seals of Sir William Boswell, Knight (the Kings own Leger Embassador at Hague in the N∣therlands;) Andreas ab Habernfeld, (a Noble Bohemian, Physitian to the Queen of Bohemia; a man of known sincerity and untainted reputation:) The Archbishop of Canterbury (who must be the sole forger of the Plot, and Letters, if fained;) and of the King himself: As the Letters, Papers themselves (ot viewed by divers of the Lords, Commons, and other persons of quality for their satisfaction, all now remai∣ning in the Custody of a Committee of the House of Commons, where any incredulous Thomas, who dares trust his own senses, may view them at his leasure) will evidence to all who know their Hands or Seales. Thirdly, that the Archbishop himselfe, and his Servants, have confessed the verity, reality of the Plot and Papers to divers who repaired to them for their own resolu∣tion therein; and the Archbishop in his late Petition to the Lords in Parliament for restitution of these Papers, hath againe fully acknowledged their reality. Fourthly, (which puts all out of question) had these Letters, Papers been Forgeries, or Impostures, not reall verities, his Majesty himselfe, or the Oxford Mercury for him; at least the Archbishop, Sir William Boswell, Andreas ab Habernfeld, or some of their Instruments, being all living, and the Presses open; would long ere this have detected this forgery, and disclaimed these Papers and Letters in Print: which neither of them have done in seven Months space; whereas each of them on the contrary (as I am informed) have avouched these severall Letters, Papers to be genuine, and their own. Finally, it had been a strange over-sight, yea madnesse in my self, and a great dishonour to, a most impolitique devise in the Parliament, to publish forged Letters in these emi∣nent living Persons names; who want neither will, meanes, nor power immediately to detect, refute, and manifest such a grosse Imposture to all the world, to the eternall infamy of the Publishers. Let Malignants and Papists then, with all others, who have any sparks of Honesty, or Policy, remaining in them, henceforth rest assured of the verity, reality, of this Plot, these Papers, though they have formerly doubted of them; else let them perish in their groundlesse Infidelity; who will neither believe the King,
the Archbishop, Sir William Boswell, nor Habrnfeld, under their Hands and Seales; nor yet the Parliament, nor Discoverer of them (by an admirable unexpected Divine Providence) who abhorres all fictions, frauds, Impostures whatsoever, and can doe nothing against the truth, Cr. 13. 8. but for the truth. I shall only adde this to the Premises; that the multitude of his Majesties royall Letters of Grace, and Discharges of Popish Recusants, Priests, Iesuits, together with his Marriage-Articles, Oathes, Letter to the Pope, and other evidences lately published in The Popish Royall Favourite, the late horrid Rebellion in Ireland, the Rebels seising of the Goods, Estates, and Persons of all the English Protestans there to the Kings use; and their bloody massacre by blood-thirsty Papists,See the Acts of the General Assembly of the ebels at ilkenny, Anno 164. printed at ondon Marc 6. 1643. Te Mystey of lniquity, p. 32. 33. &c. For the exaltation of the holy Roman Catholike Church, and the advancement of his Maiesties service, &c. And that by vertue of his Majesties speciall Commission under the Great Seale of Scot∣land, and Letters of direction sent therewith, for the effecting of this great Work; which Commission, together with the Arguments evidencing the reality thereof, you may read at large in the Mystery of iniquity newly published, pag. 34. to 42. his Majesties Articles of Pacification with those Rebels, ratified under the Great Seale of England, wherein he cals these bloody Rebels, his Roman Catholike Subjects, and good Subiects in some copies; and gives them Authority to persecute his Protestant Subiects in Irelands, with license to send such Agents to his Majesty from time to time as they shall think fit; accepting a grant of thirty thousand eight hundred pound from them, and making their base Irish money currant in England by a speciall Proclama∣tion; his sending for the Souldiers sent by the Parliament into Ireland to subdue the Rebels, and for Irish Rebels too, into England, and that By his Maiesties speciall Commission and Authority; (asThe 48 week ending Decem, . p. 681. 685. Mercurius Aulicus informs us twice together) and administring an Oath to every Officer and Souldier that shall be transported, To the utmost of his power, and hazard of his life to fight against the Forces now under the con∣duct of the Earle of Essex, and against all other Forces whatsoever that are or shal be raised under what pretence soever, contrary to his Majesties Command or Authority▪ in defence of our Protestant Religion, Lawes, Liberties. All these particulars laid together, will infallibly demonstrate the reality of this designe, and how farre it hath prevailed even with the King himselfe; whose heart and person (now wholly captivated and stolne away from the Parliament and Kingdome by these Conspi∣rators) the good God rescue out of their Traytorly hands, and restore unto us in de season: which shall be the prayer of the Publishe of this Plot, William Prynne.

ROMES MASTER-PEECE. IF there be any professing the Protestant Religion within the Kings Dominions, or elsewhere, who are yet so wilfully blinded as not to discern, so sotishly incredulous as not to believe, any reall long-prosecuted conspiracy, by former secret practises, and the present warres to extirpate the Protestant Religion, re-establish Popery, and inthrall the people in all three Kingdomes, notwithstanding all visible effects, and transparent Demonstrations of it, lively set forth in the late De∣claration of the Lords and Commons, concerning the Rise and Progresse of the Grand Re∣bellion, with other Remonstrances of that nature, most visibly appearing in the late Articles of Pacification, made by his Majesties Authority and approbation with the Irish Rebels, contrary to divers Acts of Parliament passed by the King this present Session: Let them now advisedly fixe their Eyes, Minds, upon the ensuing Letters and Discoveries, (seised on by Master Prynne, in the Archbishops Chamber in the Tower, May 31. 1643. by Warrant from the Close Committee, to search his Papers there, being unexpectedly commanded on that service) and then they must needs acknow∣ledge it an indubitable verity; Since Sir William Boswell, the Archbishop himselfe, if not his Majesty, and those who revealed this Plot, were perswaded of its reality upon the first Disovery, before it brake forth openly in Ireland, and England. Who and what the Authour of this Discovery was; who the chiefe active instru∣ments in the Plot; when, and where they assembled; in what vigorous manner they daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how difficult it is to dis∣solve or counter-work it, without speciall diligence, the Relation it selfe will best dis∣cover. Whose verity if any question, these Reasons will inforce beliefe: First, That the Discoverer was a chiefe Actor in this Plot, sent hither from Rome by Cardinall Barbarino; to assist Con the Popes Legate in the pursute of it, and privy to all the particulars therein discovered. Secondly, That the horrour and reality of the conspiracy so troubled his con∣science, as it ingaged him to disclose it, yea to renounce that bloody Church and Religion, which contrived it; though bred up in, preferred by it, and promised greater advancements for his deligence in this designe. Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secrecy, and offered to confirme every particular by solemne Oath.
Fourthly, That hee discovers the persons principally imployed in this Plot, the places and times of their secret conventions; their manner and diligence in the pursite of it, with all other circumstance so punctually, as leaves no place for doubt. Fifthly, The principall Conspirators nominated by him are notoriously known to be fit instruments for such a wicked design. Sixthly, Many particulars therein have immediate relation to the King and Arch∣bishop, to whom he imparted this Discovery, and it had been an impudent boldnesse and irrationall, frentick act, to reveale any thing for truth to the King and Bishop, which they could disprove on their own knowledge. Seventhly, Sir William Boswell, and the Archbishop, if not the King himselfe, were fully satisfied, that it was reall and most important. Eightly, Some particulars are ratified by the Arch-bishops testimony, in the Me∣morials of his own life, written with his own hand some yeares before; and others so apparent, that most intelligent men in Court and City, were acquainted with them whiles they were acting, though ignorant of the plot. Finally, The late sad effects of this Conspiracy in all three Kingdomes, in prose∣cution of this design, compared with it, are such a convincing evidence of its rea∣lity; and Gods admirable hand of Providence in bringing this concealed plot so sea∣sonably to light, (by an instrument unexpectedly raised from the grave of Exile and imprisonment, to search the Arch-bishops papers, in the Tower, who had there seised his in former times, and shut him up close prisoner in a Forraine Dungeon) such a testimony from Heaven super-added to the premises, that hee who deemes it an imposture, may well be reputed an Infidell, if not a Monster of incredulity. The first overture and larger Relation of the plot it selfe were both writ in Latin, as they are here Printed, and faithfully translated word for word, as neare as the Dia∣lect will permit. All which premised, the Letters and plot here follow in order. Sir Williams Boswels first Letter to the Arch-bishop concer∣ning the Plot. May it please your Grace, THe offers (whereof your Grace will finde a Copy) here inclosed towards a further and more particular discovery, were first made unto me at the se∣cond hand, and in speech, by a friend of good quality and worth in this place; But soone after (as soone as they could be put into Order) were avowed by the principall party; and delivered me in writing by both together: Up∣on promise, and Oath, which I was required to give, and gave accordingly, not to reveale the same to any other man living but your Grace; and by your Graces hand, unto his Majesty. In like manner they have tyed themselves not to declare these things unto any o∣ther, but my selfe; untill they should know, how his Majesty and your Grace
would dispose thereof. The Principall giving me withall to know, That hee puts himselfe, and this secret into your Graces power, as well because it concernes your Grace so nearely after his Majesty: As that he knowes your wisdome to guide the same aright: And is assured of your Graces fidelity to his Majesties Person, to our State, and to our Church. First, Your Grace is humbly, and earnestly prayed, To signifie his Majesties plea∣sure (with all possible speed) together with your Graces disposition herein, and pur∣pose to carry all with silence, from all, but his Majesty untill due time. Secondly, When your Grace shall think fit to shew these things unto his Majesty▪ To doe it immediately; not trusting to Letters; nor permitting any other person to be by, or in hearing: And to entreat and counsell his Majesty as in a case of Consci∣ence to keep the same wholly, and solely in his own bosome, from the knowledge of all other creatures living but your Grace; untill the businesse shall be cleare, and suffi∣ciently in his Majesties and your Graces hands to effect. Thirdly, Not to enqure or demand the names of the parties from whom these overtures doe come, or any further discoveries and advertisements in pursute of them which shall come hereafter, untill due satisfaction shall be given in every part of them. Nor to bewray unto any person but his Majesty, in any measure or kinde, that any thing of this nature, or of any great importance is come from me. For as I may believe these overtures are verifiable in the way they will be layed; and that the parties will not shrink: So I may accompt, That if never so little a glimpse, or shadow of these informations shall appeare by his Majesties, or your Graces speech or carriage, unto others, the meanes whereby the businesse may bee brought best unto tryall, will bee utterly disappointed: And the parties who have in Conscience towards God, and devotion to his Majesty; affection to your Grace, and compassion of our Countrey, disclosed these things, will runne a present and ex∣treame hazard of their persons, and lives, So easily it will be conjectured (upon the least occasion given upon his Majesties or your Graces parts) who is the discoverer? By what meanes, and how he knowes so much of these things; And where he is? These are the points, which together with the offers, they have pressed me especially to represent most seriously unto your Grace. For my own particular, having most humbly craved pardon of any errour or o∣missions, that have befalne me in the mesnaging of this businesse, I doe beseech your Grace to let me know; First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with the parties? Secondly, What points of these offers I shall chiefly, and first put them to enlarge and cleare? Thirdly, What other points and enquiries I shall propose unto them? And in what manner?
Fourthly, How farre further I shall suffer my selfe to heare and know these things▪ Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties answers, and discoveries sealed up by themselves, and having likewise put my owne seale upon them, without que∣stioning or seeing what they containe, so to transmit them to his Majesty or your Grace? Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some faire occasion, That there will be a due Regard held of them, and their service, by his Majesty and your Grace: When all particulars undertaken in these generall offers, and necessary for perfecting the discovery and work intended, shall be effectually delivered to his Majesty on your Grace? Upon these heads, and such others as his Majesty or your Grace shall think pro∣per in the businesse, I must with all humility beseech your Grace to furnish me with instructions, and warrant for my proceedings, under his Majesties hand with your Graces attestation, as by his Majesties goodnesse, and Royall disposition is usuall in like cases. May it please your Grace to entertaine a Cypher with me upon this occasion, I have sent the Counterpart of one here inclosed: In the vacant spaces whereof your Grace may insert such names more, with numbers to them, as you think requisite. If these overtures happily sort with his Majesties and your Graces minde, and shall accordingly prove effectuall in their operation, I shall think my selfe a most happy man, to have had my oblation in so pious a work for my most gratious Soveraign and Master: More particularly, in that your Grace under his Majesty shall be, Opifex rerum & mundi melioris origo. Which I shall incessantly begge in my prayers at his hands, who is the giver of all good things, And will never forsake, or aile them, who doe not first faile, and fall from him: The God of mercy and Peace. With which I remaine evermore. I have not dared to trust this businesse (without a Cypher) but by a sure hand, for which▪ I have sent this bearer, my Secretary, Expresse, but he knoweth nothing of the contents hereof.

Observantissimus & officiosissimus Andreas ab Habernfeld. Most Illustrious and most Re∣verend Lord, AL my senses are shaken together as of∣ten as I revolve the present businesse, neither doth my understanding suffice (to conceive) what wind hath brought such horrid things, that they should see the Sun∣shine by me: for besides expectation this good man became known unto me, who whē he had heard me discoursing of these Scottish stirs, said that I knew not the nerve of the business, that those things which are commonly scat∣tered abroad are superficial: From that hour he every day became more familiar to me; who acknowledging my dexterity herein, with a full brest powred forth the burdens of his heart into my besome, supposing that he had discharged a burden of conscience where∣with he was pressed. Hence he related to me the Factions of the Iesuites, with which the whole earthly world was assaulted; and shewed, that I might behold how through their poyson, Bohemia & Germany were de∣voured, & both of them maimed with an ir∣reparable wound; that the same Plague did creep through the Realmes of England and Scotland, the matter wherof revealed in the adjacent writing, he discovered to me: which things having heardIf a stranger were thus af∣fected at the hearing of this Plot, how should we our selves be sensi∣ble thereof? my bowels were con∣tracted together, my loyns trembled with hor∣rour, that a pernicious gulf should be prepared for so many thousands of soules: with words moving the conscience, I inflamed the minde of the man: he had scarce one hour concocted my admonitions, but he disclosed all the se∣crets
and he gave free liberty that I should treat with those whom it concerned, that they might be informed hereof. I thought no delay was to be made about the things: The same houre I went to Master Boswell the Kings Leger at the Hage, who being tied with an oath of secrecie to me, I communicated the businesse to him, I admonished him to weigh these things by the ballance, neither to defer, but act, that those who were in danger might be speedily succoured: He, as becomes an ho∣nest man, mindfull of his duty, and having nearer looked into the businesse, refused not to obey the monitions: moreover, he forthwith caused that an expresse should be dispatched; and sent word back again what a most accep∣table oblation this had been to the King and your Grace; for which we rejoyced from the heart, and we judged, that a safe and fa∣vourable Deity had interposed it selfe in this businesse, whereby you might be preserved. Now that the verity of the things related might be confirmed, some principall heads of the conspiracy were purposely pretrmit∣ted, that the knowledge of them might bee extrted from the circumvented society of the conspirators. Now the things will be speedily and safely promoted into act, if they be warily proceeded in at Bruxels. By my advise, that day should be observed wherin the Packet of Letters are dispatched, which under the title of, To Monsieur Strario Archdeacon of Cambray, tied with one cover are delivered to the post∣master, such a packet may be secretly brought back from him, yet it will be unprofitable, be∣cause all the inclosed Letters are written Characteristically. Likewise another Packet comming weekly frō Rome, which is brought under this subscription, To the most illustri∣ous Lord Count Rossetti, Legat for the time; these are not to be neglected: to whom like∣wise Letters writ in the same Character are included. That they may be understood, Reade is to be consulted with. The forenamed day of dispatch shal be expected: In Reades house
an accumulated congregation may be cir∣cumvented; which succeeding, it will be your Graces part to order the businesse. The intestine enemy being at length de∣tected by Gods grace, all bitternesse of minde which is caused on either side may be abolished, delivered to oblivion, deleted and quieted, the enemy be invaded on both parts: thus the King and the Kings friend, and both Kingdomes neere to dan∣ger, shall be preserved, delivered from im∣minent danger. Your Grace likewise may have this injun∣ction by you, if you desire to have the best advise given you by others, that you trust not overmuch to your Pursevant, for some of them live under the stipend of the popish party. How many Rocks, how many Scillaes, how many displeased Cha∣ribdes appear before your Grace, in what a dangerous sea the Cockbote of your Gra∣ces life, next to shipwrack, is tssed, your selfe may judge, the fore deck of the Ship is speedily to be driven to the harbour. All these things (I whisper) into your Graces eare, for I know it bound with an oath of secresie, therefore by open name, I would by these presents become known to your Grace, Hage 14. Sept. S.

That there is a meanes to be pre∣scribed, whereby both of them in this case may be preserved, and this tumult speedily composed. 5. ThatThe Jeuits plts are never en∣ded till they ob∣taine their desired ends in all things. although these Scottish tu∣mults be speedily cōposed, yet that the King is endangered, and that there are many waies, by which destruction is plotted to the King & L. Archbishop. 6. That a certaine society hath con∣spired, which attempts the death of the King, and L. Archbishop, and Con∣vulssion of the whole Realme. 7. That the same society every week deposits with the President of the so∣ciety, what intelligence every of them hath purchased in eight daies search, and then confer all into one packet, which is weekly sent to theThe Pope and Cardi∣nll  Director of the businesse.
8. That all the confederates in the said conspiracy may verily be named by the poll. But because they may be made knowne by other meanes, it is thought meet to defer it till hereafter. 9. That there is a ready meanes, whereby the villany may be discove∣red in one moment, the chiefe conspi∣rators circumvented, and the primary members of the conjuation, appre∣hended in the very act. 10. That very many about the King,His Maje∣sty and the Realme may be soone be∣trayed by such false attendants. who are accounted most faithfull and in∣timate, to whom likewise the more secret things are instrusted, ARE TRAY∣TORS TO THE KING, cor∣rupted with a forraigne Pension, who communicate all secrets of greater or lesser moment to a forraigne power. These and other most secret things, which shall be necessary to be known for the security of the King, may be re∣vealed, if these things shall be accepta∣ble to the Lord Archbishop. In the mean time, if his Royall Ma∣jesty and the L. Archbishop desire to consult well to themselvas, they shall keep these things, onely superficially communicated unto them, most secret∣ly▪ under deep silence, not communi∣cating them so much as to those whom they judge most faithful to them, be∣fore they shall receive by name, in whom they may confide; for else they are safe on no side. Likewise they may be assured, that whatsoever things, are here proposed, are no figments, nor fables, nor vaine dreams, but such reall verities, which may be demonstrated in every small tittle. For those who thrust them∣selves into this businesse are such men, who mind no gaine, but the very zeal of Christian charity suffers them not to conceale these things: yet both from his Majesty and the Lord Archbishop
some small examplar of gratitude will be expected. All these Premisses have been com∣municated under good faith, and the Sacrament of an oath to Mr. Leger Embassadour of the King of Great Brittain, at the Hague; that he should not immediately trust, or communicate these things to any mortall, besides the King and the L.

The Archbishop of Canterburies Letter to the King concerning the Plot: with the Kings directions in the Margin, written with His own hand.I beseech Your Majesty read these Letters a they are endor∣sed by figures, 1, 2, 3, &c. May it please your Majesty, AS great as the Secret is which comes herewith, yet I choose ra∣ther to send it in this silent covert way,Ye had reason so to doe. and I hope safe, then to come thither, and bring it my selfe. First, because I am no way able to make haste enough with it. Secondly, because should I come at this time, and antedate the meeting Septemb. 24. there would be more jealousie of the businesse, and more enquiry after it: especially, if I being once there, should re∣turne againe before that day, as I must if this be followed, as is most fit. The danger it seemes is imminent, and laid by God knowes whom, but to be exe∣cuted by them which are very neere about you. (For the great honour which I have to be in danger with you, or for you, I passe not, so your sacred Person and the State may be safe.)It is an unanswe∣rable Dilemma. Now, may it please your Majesty, This information is either true, or there is some mistake in it: If it be true, the persons which make the discovery will deserve thankes and reward; If there should be any mistake in it, your Majesty can lose nothing but a little silence.
The businesse (if it be) is exteam foul.I cncur totally with you in opi∣nion, assuring you that no body doth, or shall know of this bu∣sinesse, and to shew my care to conceale it, I received this but this after∣noon, and now I make this dispatch before I sleepe. Herewith I send his warrant, as you advise, which indeed I judge to bee the better way. The discovery thus by Gods providence offered, seems fair. I doe hereby humbly beg it upon my knees of your Majestie, that you will conceale this businesse from every creature, and his name that sends this to me. And I send his Letters to me to your Majestie, that you may see his sence both of the businesse and the secrecy. And such Instructions as you thinke fit to give him, I beseech you let them be in your own hand for his warrant, with∣out imparting them to any. And if your Majestie leave it to his discretion to fol∣low it there in the best way he can, that in your own hand will be instruction and warrant enough for him. And if you please to return it herewith presently to me, I will send an expresse away with it presently. In the mean time I have by this expresse returned him this answer,I like your an∣swer extreame well, and doe promise not to deceive your confidence, nor make you break your word. That I think he shall doe well to hold on the Treatie with these men with all care and secrecie, and drive on to the discovery so soon as the businesse is ripe for it, that he may as∣sure himselfe and them, they shall not want reward, if they do the service. That for my part he shall be sure of secrecy, and that I am most confident that your Ma∣jesty will not impart it to any. That he have a speciall eye to the eighth and ninth Proposition. Sir, for Gods sake, and your own safety,I have sent all back. I thinke these Apostyles will bee warrant enough for you to proceed, especially when I expressly command you to doe so. secrecie in this businesse: And I beseech you send me back this Letter, and all that comes with it, speedily and secretly, and trust not your own pockets with them. I shall not eat nor sleep in quiet till I receive them. And so soon as I have them again, and your Majesties warrant to proceed, no dili∣gence shall be wanting in me to help on the discoverie. This is the greatest businesse that ever was put to me.In this I am as far from con∣demning your judgement as su∣specting your fidelitie. C. R. And if I have herein pro∣posed or done any thing amisse, I most humbly crave your Majesties pardon. But I am willing to hope I have not herein erred in judgement, and in fidelity I ne∣ver will. These letters came to me on Thursday, Septemb. 10. at night, and I sent these away according to the date hereof, being extreamly wearied with writing this Let∣ter, copying out these other which come with this, and dispaching my Letters back to him that sent these, all in my own hand. Once again secrecy for Gods sake, and your own. To his most blessed protection I commend your Majestie and all your Affairs: and am The Kings hand and date. Yorke 13. Lambeth Septemb. 11. 1640.

I dealt with the party to make good his offers formerly put in my hand, and transmitted to your Grace: This he hopes to have done, by the inclosed, so far as will be needfull for his Majesties satisfaction; yet if any more particular explanation or discovery shall be required by his Majestie or your Grace, He hath promised to adde thereunto, whatsoever he can remember and knowes of truth.

Sciant primò, bonum istum vi∣rum per quem sequentia deteguntur, in pulvere isto Pontificio esse natum & educatum, qui in dignitatibus Ecclesiasticis aetates consumpit; Tan∣dem praesentis Negotii expeditio∣ni, par invent, Consilio & man∣dato Dmini Cardnalis Barbarini, ad auxilium Domino Cuneo adjun∣ctus est: penes quem in officio ita diligens ac sedulus inventus, ut spes magnae promotionis ipsi data fuerit: ipse vero, boni Spiritus du∣ctus instinctu▪ ut t dulcia promissa contempsit; agnitisque Religionis Pontificiae vanitatibus; (quarum alias defensor fuerat severissimus) ma∣litia etiam sub vexillo Papali mili∣tantium notata, gravari Conscien∣tiam

Quo fa∣cto ab eodem amico serio conmo∣nitus, verae conversionis, Charitis∣que exemplar ostenderet; liberaet ab imminenti discrimine, inno∣centes tot Animas; In cujus mo∣nita lubens consenserat, calamo∣que sequentia excipiendum dederat, ex quibus Articuli non ita pri∣dem tuae Reverentiae oblati, lucu∣lenter explicari & demonstrari po∣terunt. 1 Ante omnia, ut Cardo rei re∣cipiatur, scindum est, omnes istas, quibus tota Christianitas hodie con∣cutitur, factiones, exoriri, ab Je∣suitica ista Chamea Sobole, cujus quatuor per orbm luxuriant or∣dines. Primi Ordinis sunt Ecclesiastici, quorum Religionis promotoria, est crar. Secundi Ordiis sunt Politici, quo∣rum officium est, statum Regnorum, Rerumque publicarum, quo quomodo intentare, turbare, reformare. Tertii Ordinis sunt Sulares, quo∣rum proprium est, Regibus, Principi∣busque, ad officia sese obtrudere, insi∣nuare, immiscere se rebus forensibus; emptionibus, venditionibusque, & quae civilia sunt occupari. Quarti Ordinis Exploratores sunt, sortis inferioris homines, qui ser∣vitiis Magnatum, Principum, Ba∣ronum, Nobilium, Civium, sese sub nittunt, animis dominorum im∣posituri.
II. Tot ordinum societatem, Regnum Anglicanum alit: Vix enim tota Hispa∣nia, Gallia, & Italia tantam multitudi∣nem, Jesuitarum, quantam unicum Londinum, exhibere posset: Ubi plus uam 50 Scoti Jesuitae reperiuntur. Ibi sedem iniquitatis, dicta societas sibi ele∣git, Conspiravitque in Regem, Regique fidelissimos, inprimis vero Dominum Archiepiscopum Cantuariensem, etiam in regnum utrumque. III. Certo certius enim est; Determi∣asse societatem nominatam, reforma∣ione universali Regnum Angliae tum Scotiae adficere; Determinatio ergò finis, inert necessario determinationem mediorum ad finem. IIII. Ad promovendum ergo susceptum scelus, Titulo, Congregationis Fidei pro∣pagandae, dicta societas sese insignivit: quae Caput Collegii Pontificem Roma∣num, substitutum & executorem, Cardi∣alem Barbarinum, agnoscit. V. Patronus Societatis primarius Londi∣i, est Legatus Pontificius, qui curam negotii gerit; in cujus sinum, saex illa proditorum omnia explorata, hebdo∣madatim deponit: Impetrata autem est esda Legationis istius Londini, Ponti∣fici Romani nomine, qua mediante, Car∣dinali Barbarino, agere in Regem Reg∣umque tanto tutius faciliusque liceret, Nullus enim alias, tam libere ambire Regem posset, quam ille qui Pontificia Auctoritate palliatus sit.

Quo∣rum omnium intercessionibus neglectis, societatem vel familiaritatem Cunei, peste pejus fugiebat; Persuadebatur etiam ab aliis non infimis, ipsi bene notis, nec tamen conmovebatur. VII. Quaerebatur & alius qui ad facinus detestandum accessum impediebat, Se∣cretarius Cook; erat is oor Jesuitarum infensissimus, quibus aditum ad Regem intercipiebat, excipebat plurimos pro meritis, in illorum factiones sedulo iquirebat; quo nomine incitamentum omne, vi magneticam ad partem Pontificiam spirans, erat apud ipsum inefficax, nihil enim tam carum erat, quod ipsum ad pravum inclinasset: Hinc, Conjurationis Patronis exosus factus; peiclitabatur de officio ut exueretur, laborabatur per triennium, quod ultimo impetratum. Mansit nihilominus ab parte Regis, nodus solutu difficilis; Dominus Ar∣chiepiscopus enim constantia sua, sicuti durissimum sese interposuit saxum. Laborasse se incassum, ab parte do∣mini Archiepiscopi Cuneus cum intel∣lexisset, efferbuit mlitia ipsius, totiusque Societatis; mox  parari caeperunt, quibus dominus Archiepiscopus una cum Rega caperetur. In regem quoque (cujus gratia totum istud disponitur Negotium) à quo quia nihil quod promovendae Religioni Papisticae inserviret speratur, (impri∣mis verò, Cum animum suum aperuerit, se ejus opinionis esse, quemvis in Re∣ligione sua dummodo vir probus
& pius sit, Salvari psse) sententia lata est. VIII. Ad perpetrandum susceptum facinus, executio criminalis VVestmonastei, per scripta nonualla Puritanorum cau∣sata, primi incendii ansam dedit, quae res ab Papistis apud Puritanos in tan∣tum excerbabatur, exaggerabaturque, ut si inulta maneret, Religioni ipsis du∣ceretur; cujus incendii, subsequens tan∣dem liber precum, flammas auxit. IX. In isto fervore expeditus furit ad Sco∣tos ab parte pontificia Comes quidam Scotus Maxfild, ni fallor nomine, cum quo, duo alii Comites Scoti Papistae, correspondebant. Is commovere debe∣bat plebem, injuriamque refricare ut animos accenderet, ad arma precipita∣ret, quibus noxius libertatis Scoticae perimeretur Turbator. X. Ibi una opera paratus in Casses Regi, eo enim directum esse praesens negoti∣um ut Anglorum complurimi sese ad∣glutinarent Scotis; Rex armis maneret inferior, qui ab Papistis auxilia petere cogeretur, quae tamen non impetraret, nisi in conditiones descenderet, quibus libertatem Vniversalem exercitii Religi∣onis Pontifiiae, permitteret; it a enim res Papistarum ad nutum succederent, Quo consensu si difficiliorem sese exhi∣buerit, remedium erit in promptu: A∣dolescente enim cum primum Regio filio, (qui à teneris, ut parti Pontificiae adsuescat educatur) de Rege actum est:
Nux quippe Indica acutissimo veneno referta in societate servatur (quam Cu∣neus tum temporis gloriabundus mihi oftentabat) quo Regi exemplo Patris, parabatur Pharmacum. XI. In ista Commotione Scotica Mar∣quesse d' Hamelton saepius Regis nomine ad Scotos ablegatur, regiam auctorita∣tem interponere, quâ aestus animorum mitigaretur, sine fructu tamen, reque infecta toties reversu. Ipsius Concio∣nator tum temporis nos adiit, qui cum Cuneo secretè nonnulla Communicavit; Interrogatus a me, joco; Num etiam Iudaei, cum Samaritanis convenirent? Ad quae Cuneus respondit, Vtinam omnes ministri tales, ut ipse, essent; conjiciatur hinc quidcunque. XII. Rebus sic stantibus, ab Cardinali Richelieu, Dominus Thomas Camra∣rius, Sacellanus & Eleemosinarius ipsi∣us, natione Scotus, Londinum adpu∣lit; Qui Collego Societatis conjuratae adsidere debebat, rem{que} seriò agere, ihil intentatum relinquere, quo primus ex∣asperaretur servor. Quo officio honora∣rium Episcopatus, erat ipsi pollicitum. Cohabitabat & Societati per quatuor Menses, nec prius discedendum licebat, donec rebus ex voto cedentibus, cum bonis novis redux fieri possit. XIII. Cavalliero Toias Mathei Sacerdos Jesuita, ordinis politicorum, è capiti∣bus primariis homo vigilantissimus, cui nunquam tam charum cubile, quo

In summa, cuivis societati sese adglutinat, nullum vebum effari potest, quod ipse non arripiat & ad partes suas accommodet. Quicquid interea temporis expiscatus, in catalogum redigit, & quavis Aestate ad Consistorium generale Jesuitarum Politicoū quod in Provincia Wallen∣si secretò concurrit, hospes acceptus deert. Ibi tacitè consilia cuduntu quae ad convulsionem status Ecclesiastici, turn Politici, Regni utriusque sunt aptissima. XIIII. Capitaneus Reda Scotus, habitans in platea Longaker, prope tabernam Angeli, Jesuita saecularis, quiob dete∣standum officium praestitum (quo mi∣nistrum quendam Ecclesiae, incitamen∣tis dulcibus ad religionem Papisticam, tota cum familia ipsius perverterat, filia ipsius in uxorem ducta) pro repen∣sa obtinuit reditus vel vectigal Butirace∣um, quod rustici sibi praestare tenen∣tur, adquisitum ipsi ab rege, per non∣nullos Societatis praecipuos; cui sti∣mulus nunquam deficit, quo in officio
constans deineatur. In ipsius aeibus Rei totius peragitur Negotium, ubi So∣cietas quae in Regem & dominum Ar∣chiepiscopum, regnumque utrumque conjuravit, plerumque diebus singulis concurrit; Die vero expeditionis tabel∣larii, quae ordinariè est dies veneris, tanto frequentiores, tum enim omnes exploratores conveniunt, quae quisque ea hebdomada expiscatus est, in com∣mune conferunt; qui ut extra suspitio∣nem sint, secreta sua per Tobiam Ma∣thei vel ipsum Redam, ad Legatum Pon∣tificium, amandant; ipse, fasciculum compactum quem ab exploratoribus nundinatus est, Romam transmittit. Apud eundem Redam deponuntur literae Roma illatae, sub titulis & nomi∣nibus fictis, quae per ipsum singulis ad quos spectant traduntur, illorum enim omnium & singulorum nomina ipsi sunt cognita. Eadem ipsa occasione adferuntur etiam literae, sub coperta Patris Philippi (ipso tamen rerum nescio) a quo conjuratis dstribuuntur. Habetur in illis ipsis aedibus Sacellum publicum; cui Jesuita ordinarius con∣secrat, ibidemque habitat. In dicto Sacello missae celebrantur quotidie à Jesuitis▪ Baptismque liberis domesticis & nonnullorum conjuratorum inser∣vitur. Qui in nominatis aedibus concur∣runt, Rhodis vel Equis, frequenter habitu Politico, magnoque Comitatu, quo palliantur ne innotescant, Jesuitae tamen sunt, & membra societatis conjurata.
XV. Hoc caetu contribuitur ab omnibu Papistis Angliae, ne quidquam ad pro∣movendum susceptum negotium de∣ciat. In quem fiscum, unica vidua pro∣prietaria olim aedium quas modo Secre∣tarius Windebanck inhabitat, ante trien∣nium defuncta 40000 librarum Angli∣carum, contulit; sic & alii etiam citra∣vires faciunt, modo ad optatum finem▪ promoveatur negotium. XVI. Praeternominatas Eedes, etiam pe alia loca secretiora fiunt conventicula, de quibus ne inter se quidem fidunt, met ne dispatentur. Convocantur pri∣mo ad certa diversoria singuli (alter alterius inscius) hinc per exploratores ad locum ubi convenire debent, singuli deducuntur, ignari alias ubi conventuri sint, ne forte insperato obruantur. XVII. Comitissa'd Arondel, strenua Ponti∣ficiae Religionis propugnatrix, ad Re∣formationem universalem omnes ner∣vos intendit, quicquid ad aulam regis▪ secretè vel apertè verbis vel factis geri∣tur, Legato Pontificio infinuat, cum quo ad minimum ter de die, modo in Aedibus Arondelianis, jàm ad aulam vel Tarthalae cum ipso congreditur; Ex ungue talia vix exugit. Ipse Cmes vocatus jam à triennio hoc anno ire debebat Romam, acturu ibi dubio procul de seriis Negotium concernentibus.
Donis dictionibusque suis, Jesuitae missis invigilant. Grinwici, impensis Comitis, Schola foeminea sustentatur; quaealias Monaste∣rium Monialium est; Adultae enim inibi Juvenculae, hic inde per extera transmari∣na monasteria, emittuntur. 18. Dominus Porter, Cubicularius Re∣gius, Pontificiae Religioni addictissimus; Regis infensus hostis, Is ipsius secretissi∣ma quaeque, Legato Pontificio aperit, quamvis rarissie cum ipso conveniat; Uxor tant saepiùs, quae ab marito infor∣mata, Legato secreta confidit: In omni∣bus suis actionibus Tobiae Mathei nihil dit; effari non potest qualiter negotio invigilet. Filii ipsius in Religione Pontificia o∣culte informantur, aperte Reformatam profitentur. Major natu officum Patris suscepturus, sub Rege suturo; Alteri, si negotium bene successerit, pileus Cardina∣lis paratus est.

WE have willingly and cordi∣ally perceived, that our offers have been acceptable both to his Royall Majestie, and likewise to your Grace. This is the only Index to us, That the blessing of God is present with you, whereby a spur is gi∣ven, that wee should so much the more cheerfully and freely utter and detect those things whereby the hazard of both your lives, the subversion of the Realme and State both of England and Scot∣land, the tumbling down of his Excellent Majesty from his Throne, is intended. Now least the Discourse should be enlar∣ged with superfluous circumstances, we will onely premise some things which are meerly necessary to the businesse. They may first of all know, that this The qua∣lity of the discovere & meane inducing him to re∣veale this plot. good man, by whom the ensuing things are detected, was borne and bred in the Popish Religion, who spent many yeeres in Ecclesiasticall dignities, At length be∣ing found fit for the expedition of the pre∣sent Designe, by the counsell and man∣date of the Lord Cardinall Barbarino, he was adjoyned to the assistance of Master Cuneus (The Popes Nuncio then in England. Cun) by whom he was found so diligent and sedulous in his Office, that hope of great promotion was given to him. Yet he, led by the instinct of the good Spirit, hath, howsoever it be, contemned sweet promises, & having known the va∣nities of the Pontifician Religiō (of which he had sometime been a most severe de∣fender) having likewise noted the ma∣lice of those who fight under the Po∣pish
banner, felt his Conscience to be burdned; which burden that he might ease himself of, he converted his mind to the Orthodox Religion. Soon af∣ter, that he might exonerate his Consci∣ence, he thought it, that a desperate Trea∣son, machinated against so many soules, was to be revealed, and that he should receive ease if he vented such things in∣to the bosome of a friend: which done, he was seriously admonished by the said friend, that he should shew an example of his conversion and charity, and free so many innocent soules from imminent danger. To whose monitions hee wil∣lingly consented, and delivered the following things to be put in writing, out of which the Articles not long since ten∣dered to your Grace, may be cleerly ex∣plicated and demonstrated. 1 First of all,Four sorts of Jesuits. that the hinge of the businesse may be rightly discerned, it is to be known, that all those factions with which all Christendome is at this day shaken, do arise from the Iesuiticall off∣spring of Cham, of which four orders abound thorowout the world. Of the first Order are Ecclesiasticks, whose office it is to take care of things promoting Religion. Of the second Order are Politicians, whose office it is by any means to shake, trouble, reforme the state of Kingdomes and Republikes. Of the third Order are Seculars, whose property it is to obtrde themselves into Offices with Kings and Princes, to in∣sinuate and immix themselves in Court businesses, bargains and sales, and to be busied in civill affairs. Of the fourth Order are Intelligencers (or spies) men of inferiour condition, who submit themselves to theA good caveat to Nobles & Gentle∣men to beware they en∣tertaine not a Jesu∣it or Ro∣mish spie in their houses in stead of a servant. services of great men, Princes, Barons, Noblemen, Citizens, to deceive (or corrupt) the mindes of their masters.
2. A Society of so many Orders, the We had need look about, when so many active Traytors are harboured among us, even perchance at this present, Kingdome of England nourisheth: for scarce all Spain, France, and Italy, can yeeld so great a multitude of Jesuites, as London alone; where are found more then 50 Scottish Jesuites. There the said society hath elected to it selfe a seat of iniquity, and hath cnspired against the King, and the most faithfull to the King, especially the Lord Archbishop of Can∣terbury, and likewise against both king∣domes. 3. For it is more certaine then cer∣tainty it self,Therfore both Kindoms need look to them∣selves. that the forenamed society hath determined to effect an universall reformation of the Kingdome of Eng∣land and Scotland. Therefore the deter∣mination of the end, necessarily infers a de∣termination of means to the end. 4. Therefore to promote the undertaken Villany,Strange that such a society should be erect∣ed under the Defender of the faith. the said society dubbed it selfe with the Title of, The Congregation of propagating the Faith; which acknow∣ledgeth the Pope of Rome the Head of the Colledge, and Cardinall Barbarino his substitute and Executor. 5. The chief Patron of the society at London,A strange world when a Popes Legate shall be openly harboured so neere the King and Court, and have freccesse to both with∣out controule. is the Popes Legat, who takes care of the businesse; into whose bosome, these dregs of Traytors weekly deposite all their Intelligences. Now the residence of this Legation, was obtai∣ned at London, in the name of the Roman Pontie, by whose mediation it might be lawfull for Cardinall Barbarino, to work so much the more easily & safely upon the King and kingdom.If the King truly hate the Pope, it will make his In∣struments lesse effectuall, if they come in his name. For none else could so freely circumvent the King, as he who should be palliated with the Popes Authority. 6. Master Cuneus did at that time enjoy the Office of the Popes Legat,Popes Instru∣ments are ever very active. an Vniversall Instrument of the conjured society, and a serious Promoter of the businesse, whose secrets, as likewise those of all the other Intelligencers, the present
goodman, the Communicator of all these things, did receive and expedite whither the businesse required. Cuneus set upon the chief men of the Kingdom,Strange it was that the chiefe men should not set themselves against him & his, to send thē packing hence; especially that the King him∣selfe did it not when he thus tempted & as∣saulted him. and left nothing unattempted, by what means he might corrupt them all, and inline them to the pontifician party: he inticed many with various incitements, yea, he sought to delude the King him∣selfe with gifts of Pictures, antiquities, Idols, and of other vanities brought from Rome, which yet would prevale nothing with the King. Having entred familiarity with the King,That a Popes Legat should be so familiar with the King, and the King make much of him in steed of ba∣nishing him, is a riddle. he is often requested at Hampton Court, likewise at London, to undertake the cause of the Palatine, and that he would interpose his Authority, and by his intercession perswade the Legat of Colen, that the Palatine in the next Diet to treat of peace, might be inserted into the Con∣ditions; which verily he promised, but performed the contrary. He writ indeed, that he had been so desired by the King con∣cerning such things, yet he advised not that they should be consented to, lest peradventure it might be said by the Spaniard, that the Pope of ROME had patronized an hereticall Prince. In the meane time, Cuneus smelling The Archb. therefore, & he, had some fami∣liarity, and ac∣quaintance at first. from the Archbish. most trusty to the King, that the Kings mind was wholy penulous (or doubtfull.) Resolved, That he would move every stone, and apply his forces, that he might gaine him to his party: Certainly confiding, that he had a meanes prepared. For he had a command toThis offer ap∣pears under the Archbishops own hand in the Journall of his life. offer a Cardinalls Cap to the Lord Archbishop in the name of the Pope of ROME, and that hee should allure him also with higher promises, that hee might corrupt his sincere minde. Yet a fitting occasion was never given, whereby he might insinuate himselfe into the Lord Archbishop (for the Scorpion sought an Egge: Free
accesse was to be impetrated by the Earl and Countesse of Arundel, likewise by Secretary Windebanke: The intercessi∣on of all which being neglected, he did flie the company or familiarity of Cuneus, worse then the plague:But he kept not him from the Court. He was likewise perswaded by others of no mean rank, well known to him, neither yet was he moved. 7. Another also was assayed,Jesuites are both diligent and able to re∣move their greatest oppo∣sites at Court from out of place and fa∣vour too. who hindred accesse to the detestable wickednesse, Se∣cretary Cook, he was a most bitter hater of the Jesuites, from whom he intercepted accesse to the King, he entertained many (of them) according to their deserts, he diligently inquired into their factions; by which means every incitement, breath∣thing a magneticall (attractive) power to the Popish party, was ineffectuall with him; for nothing was so dear unto him, that might incline him to wickednesse. Hereupon being made odius to the Pa∣trons of the Conspiracy▪ he was endange∣red to be discharged from his Office;It is admirable this faction should be so powerfully predominant as to displace the greatest and faithfullest Officers. it was laboured for three yeers space, and at last obtained. Yet notwithstanding there remained on the Kings part a knot hard to be un∣tied, for the Lord Archbishop by his con∣stancy, interposed himselfe as a most hard rock. When Cuneus had understood from the Lord Archbishops part,Iesuites wil be sure to move hell, when they cannot prevail with Heaven. that he had laboured in vain, his malice and the whole Societies waxed boyling hot: soon after ambushes began to be prepared, wherwith the Lord Archbishop together with the King should be taken. Likewise a sentence is passed against the King (for whose sake all this businesse is disposed) because nothing is hoped from him,Jesuites cannot indure neuters. If a man may be saved in any Religiō, he may safely imbrace any and cleave close to none. which might seem to promote the Popish religion (but especially when he had opened his minde, that he was of this opinion, that every one might be
saved in his own religion, so as he be an honest and pious man.) 8. To perpetrate the Treason undertaken, the criminallThe Bishops tynny against Puritans the best advantage, and greatest ad∣vancement of popes designes. Execution at VVestminster, caused by some writings of Puritans, gave occasion of the first fire: which thing was so much exasperated & exaggerated by the Papists to the Puritans, that if it re∣mained unrevenged, it would be thought a blemish to their Religion; The flames of which fire, the subsequent Book ofHe means the Scottish Prayer book; the alter∣ations whereof frō the English, were found in the Originall copy, under the Archbishops own hand, whē his chamber was searched. The Jesuits love to fish when the Bi∣shops trouble the streames with their innovations and Popish Ceremonies▪ The Iesuits the plotters & chief directors of the Scotish war. Pray∣ers increases. 9. In this heat, a certain Scotish Earl, called Maxfield, if I mistake not, was expedited to the Scots by the Popish par∣ty; with whom two other Scotish Earls, Papists, held correspondency: he ought to stir up the people to Commotion, and rub over the injury afresh, that he might enflame their minds, precipitate them to Arms, by which the hurtfull di∣sturber of the Scotish Liberty might be slain. 10. There, by one labour, snares are prepared for the King; for this purpose the present businesse was so ordered, that very many of the English should adhere to the Scots; That the King should remaine inferiour in Armes, who (ther∣upon) should be compelled to crave assistance from the Papists; which yet he should not obtaine, unlesse he would descend untoThe King tied to conditions by papists befor they aided him conditions, by which he should permitNow practis∣ed in Oxford, Wales, and the Northern parts, by open toleration.

To which consent, if he should shew him∣self more difficult, there should be a pre∣sent remedy at hand: For the Kings Son growing now very fast to his youthfull age (who isThe more shame & pity, and a caveat for the Parliament henceforth to look to it. educated from his ten∣der age, that hee might accustome himselfe to the Popish party) the King is to bee dispatched: For an

In this Scottish Commotion, the Marquesse of Hamelton, often dispatched to the Scots in the Names of the King, to interpose the royall Authority, whereby the heat of minds might be mitigated, returned notwithstanding as often with∣out fruit, and without ending the busi∣nesse: His Chaplaine at that time re∣paired to us, whoIt seems some Noblemens Chaplains are but the Popes and Jesuites intelligencers, if not their confederates. communicated some things secretly with Cuneus. Be∣ing demanded of me injest, Whether also the Jewes agreed with the Samaritans? Cuneus thereunto answered; would to God all Ministers were such as he: what you will, may be hence conjectured. 12. Things standing thus,All forraigne popish States contribute their best assist∣ance to reduce England to Rome. there arri∣ved at London from Cardinall Riche∣lieu, Mr. Thomas Chamberlaine, his Chaplain and Almoner, a Scot by Nation, who ought to assist the Col∣ledge of the confederate Society, and seriously to set forward the busi∣nesse, to leave nothing unattempted, whereby the first heat might be exaspe∣rated. For which service he was pro∣mised the reward of aA meet guer∣don for such a service.Jesuites will not give over acting, till they accomplish their designes. Bishopricke, He cohabited with the Society, foure moneths space; neither was it lawfull for him first to depart, untill things succeeding according to his wish, he might be able to return back again with good newes. 13. Sir Toby Matthew a Iesuited Priest,Bishops Sons oftentimes the Popes greatest Agents. of the order of politicians, a most vigilant man of the chief heads, to whom a bed was never so dear, that he would rest his head theron, refreshing his body with
sleep in a chair for an houre or two,His industrious activity should shame our slothfulnesse. neither day nor night spared his machinations; a man principally noxious, and himselfe the Plague of the King and Kingdom of England; a most impudent man, who flies to all banquets, and feasts, called or not called; never quiet, alwaies in action & perpetuall motion; thrusting himselfe into all conversations of Superiours; he urgeth conferences familiarly, that he may fish out the minds of men; what ever he observeth thence, which may bring any commodity or discommodity to the part of the conspirators, he communicates to the Popes Legat; the more secret things he himself writes to the Pope, or to Cardinall Barbarino.The protestants want of such mutuall corres∣pondency, and intelligence is a great weakning to their cause. Let them learn Wisedome by their Enemies. In sum, he ad∣joines himself to any mans company, no word can be spoken, that he will not lay hold on, and accommodate to his party. In the mean time, whatever he hath fished out, he reduceth into a Catalogue, and every summer carrieth it to the generall Consistory of the Jesuites politicks, which secretly meets together in the Province ofA fit place for their intelli∣gence and cor∣respondency with Ireland, lying in the midst between both. Wales, where he is an acceptable guest. There Councells are secretly ham∣mered which are most meet for the convul∣sion of the Ecclesiastick, and politick estate of both Kingdoms. 14. Capiaine Read a Scot,The Jesuites now make good use of all Nations and Instruments. dwelling in Longacre-streete, ner the Angell Taverne, a secular Jesuite, who for his detestable office performed (wherby he had perverted a certain Minister of the Church, with secret incitements to the Popish religion, with all his family, taking his Daughter to Wife) for aO that such Romish sedu∣cers should ob∣taine such power and re∣wards for be∣ing seducing Instruments. re∣compence obtained a rent or impost upon butter, which the Country people are bound to render to him, procured for him from the King, by some chief men of the Society, who never want a spur, wherby he may be constantly detained in his Office:
In his house the businesse of the whole Plot is concluded,The Jesuites it seems are very powerfull at Court. where the Society which hath conspired against the King, the Lord Archbishop & both Kingdoms meet together, for the most part every day: but on the day of the Carrier (or Posts) dispatch, which is ordinarily Friday, they meet in greater numbers; for then all the Intelligencers assemble, and confer in common, what things every of them hath fished out that Week; who that they may be without suspiion,The Popes weekly intelli∣gence at Rome, from hence, can produce no good to Eng∣land. send their secrets by Toby Matthew, or Read himselfe, to the Popes Legat; he trans∣mits the compacted pacquet, which he hath purchased from the Intelligencers, to Rome. With the same Read,Jesuites know how to conceal thei Names and Lodgings▪ the Letters brought from Rome are deposited, un∣der faired Titles and Names, who by him are delivered to al, to whom they appertain: For all and every of their Names are known to him. Vpon the very same occasion,There are more Popish Chappels in and about Lon∣don, then are commonly known. Letters also are brought hither under the covert of Father Philip;(he notwithstanding being ignorant of things) from whom they are distributed to the Conspira∣tors. There is in that very use a publik Chappell, wherin an ordinary Jesuite conecrates, and dwels there. In the said Chappell Masses are daily celebrated by the Jesuites, and it serves for the baptizing of the Children of the House, and of some of the Conspirators. Those who assemble in the forenamed house,Jesuites can counterfeit any habit, or part, to delude the vulgar. come frequently in Coaches or on Horse back in Lay-mens habit, and with a great Train, wherwith they are diguised, that they may not be known, yet they are Jesuites, and conjured members of the Society.
. All the Papists of ENGLAND contribute to this Assembly,Papists large contributions to undermine our Religion, should make us liberall to de∣fend it. lest any thing should be wanting to promote the undertaken Designe. Vpon whose trea∣sury, one Widdow, owner of the Houses, wherein Secretary Windebanke now dwelleth, dead above three Yeares since, bestowed fourty thousand English pounds, so likewise others contribute above their abilities, so as the businesse may be pro∣moted unto its desired end. 16. Besides the foresaid Houses,Jesuites are as wise as Serpents though not so innocent as Doves. there are Conventicles also kept in other more secret places, of which verily they con∣fide not even among themselves, for fear lest they should be discovered. First, every of them are called to certain Innes, (one not knowing of the other;) hence they are severally led by Spies to the place where they ought to meet, otherwise igno∣rant where they ought to assemble, lest peradventure they should be surprised at unawares. 17. The Countesse of Arundel,The Jesuits learne of the Serpent to se∣duce men by small instru∣ments to their ruine. a strenuous She-Champion of the Popish Religion, bends all her Nerves to the Vniversall Reformation; whatsoever she hears at the Kings Court, that is done secretly or openly, in words or deeds, she presently imparts to the Popes Legat,Her voyage to Rome to visit the Pope, made her frequently to visit his legat. with whom she meets thrice a day▪ some∣times in Arundel House, now at the Court, or at Tarthal▪ He scarce sucks such things by the Claw.

At Greenwich at the Earles costs, a femi∣nine School is maintained, which otherwise is a Monastery of Nunnes; for the young Girls therein, are sent forth hither and thither into forraine Monsteries beyond the Seas. Master Porter of the Kings Bed-chamber,Is not the King in great danger who hath such a person in his Bed-chamber, now keeper of the great Seal? most addicted to the Popish religion, is a bitter enemy of the King, he reveales all his greatest secrets to the Popes Legat; although he very rarely meets with him, yes his wife meets him so much the oftner, who being informed by her husband, conveyes secrets to the Lega. In all his actions he is nothing inferiour to Toby Matthew; it cannot be uttered▪ how diligently he watcheth on the businesse. His sonnes are secretly instructed in the Popish Religion;Both King and Prince have Iesuiticall a∣gents in their Bed-chambers. openly, they professe the Re∣formed. The eldest is now to receive his Fa∣thers Office, under the King which shall be. A Cardinals hat is provided for the other, if the Designe shall succeed well. Above three yeares past the said Master Porter,All businesses and imploy∣ments must be set aside to pro∣mote this plot. was to be sent away by the King to Maroco: but he was prohibited by the Socie∣ty, lest the businesse should suffer delay there∣by. He is a Patron of the Iesuites, for whom, for the exercise of Religion, he provides Chap∣pels both at home and abroad. Secretary Windebanke,A Iesuiticall Secretary, his flight and Ar∣ticles in Parlia∣ment, con∣firme all this and more. a most fierce Papist, is the most unfaithfull to the King of all men, who not onely betraies and reveales even the Kings greatest secrets, but likewise commu∣nicates Counsels by which the designe may be best advanced. He at least thrice every week converseth with the Legat in Nocturnal con∣venticles, and reveales those things which he thinkes fit to be knowne; for which end, he hired a house neare to the Legates house, whom he often resorts to through the Garden doore, for by this vicinity, the meeting is faci∣litated.
The said Secretary is bribed with gifts to the party of that coniured Society,Papists spare no cost. by whom he is sustained, that he may the more seriously execute his Office. He sent his Sonne expresly to Rome, who ought to insinuate himselfe into the Roman Pontif. Sir Digby,The other Conspirators names. Sir Winter, Master Mounta∣gue the younger, who hath been at Rome; my Lord Sterling, a Cosen of the Earle of Arun∣dels, a Knight, the Countesse of Newport, the Dutchesse of Buckingham; and many others who have sworne into this conspiracy, are all most vigilant in the designe. Some of those are inticed with the hope of Court, others of Politicall Offices; Others attend to the six∣teene Cardinals Caps that are vacant; which are therefore detained idle for some yeares, that they may impose a vaine hope on thse who expect them. The President of the aforesaid Society was my Lord Gage, a Iesuite Priest, dead above three yeares since. He had a Palace adorned with lascivious pictures,A cover for such a dish. which counterfeited prophanenesse in the house, but with them was palliated a Monastery, wherin forty Nunnes were maintained, hid in so great a Palace, It is situated in Queenes-street, which the statue of a Golden Queene adornes. The secu∣lar Iesuites have bought all this street,It seemes their purses were strong, & their hopes great. and have reduced it into a guadrangle, where a Iesuiticall Colledge is tacitly built, with this hope, that it might be openly finished, as soone as the universall reformation was begunne. The Popes Legat useth a threefold Cha∣racter or Cipher;His Maiesty perchance hath learnt to write Characters from him, as appeares by some of his late intercep∣ted Letters. One wherewith he commu∣nicates with all Nuncioes; Another, with Cardinall Barbaraino onely: A third, where∣with he covers some greater secrets to bee communicated. What soever things he either receiveth from the Society or other spies, those he packes up together in one bundle, dedicated under this
Inscription: To Mounsieur Stravio Arch∣deacon of Cambray: from whom at last they are promoted to Rome. These things being thus ordered, if every thing be laid to the bullance, it will satisfie speciall, all the Articles prpounded. WHEREIN. 1. THE Conspiracy against the King and Lord Arch-bishop is detected, and the meanes whereby ruine is threatned to both, demonstrated. 2. The imminent dangers to both Kingdomes are rehearsed. 3. The rise and progresse of that Scottish re is related. 4. Meanes wherby these Scottish troubles may be appeased, are suggested: for after the Scots shall know by whom and to what end their minds are incensed, they wil speedily look to themselves, neither will they suffer the for∣ces of both parts to be subdued,A good  for England now. lest a middle party interpose, which seekes (the ruine) of both. 5. With what sword the Kings throat is as∣saulted, even when these stirs shall be ended, Cunens his confession; and a visible demon∣stration, sheweth. 6. The place of the Assembly in the house of Captaine Read is nominated. 7. The day of the eight dayes dispatch by Read and the Legate is prescribed.
8. How the names of the Conspirators may be knowne. 9. Where this whole Congregation may be circumvented. 10. Some of the Principall unfaithfull ones of the Kings party are notified by name; many of whose names occur not, yet their hbitati∣ons are knowne; their names may be easily extorted from Read. If these things be warily proceeded in, the strength of the whole businesse will be brought to light; so the arrow being foreseene, the danger shall be avoyded; which that it may prosperously succeed, the Omnipotent Crea∣tor grant.

A further evidence and confirmation of some things in the Relation concerning the Archbishop of Canterbury. THe Relation of this horrid plot by a chiefe Actor in it, (with which the Arch-Prelate acquainted the King, not many daies before this Parliament began) lay concealed among the Arch-bishops papers, without any prose∣cution of the conspirators (for ought appeares) who are since dispersed in part by the Parliament, but neither dissolved nor taken off this plot, but become more active in its prosecution, putting forth their last and utmost endeavours in all places, to accomplish this their designe, which they have almost brought to maturity to our shame and grief, by new raysed civill wars both in Ireland and England. Two things in this plot, which concerne the Arch-bishop, may perchance seem strange to different sorts of men. First; That the Popes Legat should presume to tempt the Archbishop with the offer of a Cardinals cap; and some friends of his will perchance affirme, that certainely no such proffer was ever made unto him: but to put this out of question, the Bishop himselfe under his owne hand, among other memorials, in the Iournll of his life (then found by Mr. Prynne in his pocket) hath these two remarkable memorandums, Anno 1633. August 4. Sunday, newes came to Court of the Lord Arch-bishop of Can∣terburys death, and the King resolved presently to give it me. That very morning at Greenenwich there came one to me SERIOUSLY, and THAT AVOWED This must needs be the Legat, or one imployed from him. ABILITY TO PERFORME IT, and OFFERED ME TO BE A CARDINALL. I went presently TO THE KING and ACQUAIN∣TED HIM BOTH WITH THE THING AND PERSON. Aug. 17.

I ACQUAINTED HIS MAJESTY WITH IT. But my answer againe was, that somewhat dwelt within me that would not suffer that TILL ROME were other then it is: so that by his owne Notes it appeares, a Cardinals Cap was twice proffer'd him very seriously, and that he acquainted the King with it; not by way of complaint to crave justice against the party who durst presume to tempt him with such a forraigne dignity, to be the Popes sworn instrument; but, by way of advice, and to sound His Majesties opinion hereof▪ as his answer imports. Neither did he absolutely diclaime the dignity it selfe, as if he might in no case accept it, but conditionally, Till Rome should be other
then it is now, and then he would not refuse it. Indeed the Arch-bishop in hisPage 171. Re∣ply to Fisher, challengeth this title (Putriarch of another world) as his due, being given to his predecessor Anselm, and therefore could brook any other Pope (in point of Soveraignty) to Lord it over him here; and this made him refuse the Cardinalls Gap But had he resisted the Legats landing or continance here, which he never did for ought appeares, but entertained some familiarity with him at first, though they after∣wards grew more strange; or peremptorily refused the first offer with indignation, thrust out the Legate or offerer of it by head and shoulders, prosecuted him (as he did poore innocent Puritans) upon the Statute of 23 Eliz. c. 1. as a Traytor, for at∣tempting to seduce him from his Alegiancy, and subject him to the See of Rome; or brought him publikely into the Star-Chamber or High-Commission, as he did some others for lesser pretended crimes and scandals, hee had discharged the part of a good zealous Prelate and Protestant; but here was no such proceeding in this case: the very parties that tendred this Cap, presuming some good inclination in him to accept it, and good affection to the Romish Church, whichConference with Fisher, neere the end. he maintaines to be a true Church, wherein men are and may be saved; and the second proffer of the Cap fol∣lowing so soone at the heeles of the first, intimates; that the first was in such sort en∣tertained by him, as rather incouraged then discouraged the party to make the se∣cond; and his second consultation with the King concerning it, insinuates, that the King rather inclined to, then against it, or at leastwise left it arbitrary to him to accept or reject it as he best liked. As for his lukewarme severity in prosecuting Papists, it appeares most lively by his Epistle to the King before his Conference with the Iesuite Fisher, where hee useth these speeches of his arriage towards them; God forbid that I should perswade a persecution in any kind, or practise it in the least (against Priests and Jesuites.) For to my remembrance I have not given him or his so much as crosse language. Therefore he is no great enemy to them: the edge of eale being wholly bent against Puritans whom hee prosecuted even to strong Cities, Countries withall manner of Tortures. The second thing which may seeme strange to others, disaffected to him▪ is this; that the Popes Legat and Jesuites should ever ate, or conspire his death, unlesse he were an utter Enemy to all Popery, Papists and the Church of Rome; which admits an easie answer: The truth is, the Bishop being very pragmaticall and wilfull in his courses, could not well brooke pragmaticall, peremptory Iesuits, who in Popish King∣domes are in perpetuall enmity with all other orders, and they with them; they ha∣ving beene oft banished out ofSee the Ge∣nerall Hist. of France in the life of H. 3. & 4. France and other Realmes by the Sorbonists, Domi∣nicans and other orders, no Protestants writing so bitterly against this Popish Or∣der as themselves, as some of their Priests, Dominicans, and other Friers have done: yea the Priests and Jesuites inSee the Eng∣lish Pope. England were lately at great variance, and persecuted, and writ against one another with much violence; This same then is no good argument that the Arch-bi. held no correspondence with Priests and other Orders, can beare no good affection to the Church of Rome, in whose superstitious Ceremonies he outstripped most Priests themselves. VVhat correspondency he held with Franciscus de Sancta Clara, with other Priests, and Doctor Smith Bishop of Calcedon, whom the Jesuits likewise have persecuted, and got excommunicated, (though of their owne Church and religion) is at large discovered in a Books in∣led,
The English Pope: and how well he approved of some Romish doctrines, Al∣ts and Massing rites, is evident by the Scottish Common-prayer-booke, then found in the Archbishops chamber, with all those alterations, wherein it differs from the English, written with his owne hand in the margin, some of which smell very strongly of Popery; as namely, his blotting out of these words at the delivery of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, Take and eate this in remembrance that Christ dyed for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith with thankesgiving: Take and drink this in remembrance that Christs blood was shed for thee, &c. and leaving onely this former clause (the better to justifie and imply aWith which his Speech in Star-chamber agrees, There it is, Hoc est corpus mum, &c. corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament) The body of our Lord Iesus Christ which was given for thee; The blood of our Lord Iesus Christ which was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soule unto ever∣lasting life. And this popish Rubricke therein written with his owne hand. The Presbyter during the time of consecration shall stand AT THE MIDDLE OF THE ALTAR, where he may with more ease and decencyTo elevate the Hosia, as Papists do. USE BOTH HIS HANDS, then he can do if he stand at the North end: with other particulars of this kind. Moreover, in his booke of Private devotions, written with his owne hand, he hath (after the Romish form) reduced all his prayers to Canicall houres, (many of them for his late good Lord and Master the Duke and Dutches of Buckingham, and their family; and some against the Scotch Rebels, as he stiles them.) And in the fore-mentioned Memorials of his life, written with his owne hand, there are these suspicious passages, among others, besides the offer of the Cardinals-cap, An. 1631. In. 21. and 26. My nearer acquaintance began to settle with Do. S. God blesse us in it. Inii 25. D. S. with me at Fulham cum M. &c. (meant of Dr. Smith, the Popish Bishop of Calcedon, as is conceived) Iun. 25.

About this time Dr. Theodor Price, Subdean of West∣minster, a man very intimate with the Archbishop, and recommended specially to the King by him to be a Welsh Bishop (in opposition to the Earle of Pembroke, and his Chaptain Griffith Williams, now an Irish Prelate;) soon after died a reconciled Papist, and received extream Vnction from a Priest: Noscitur ex comite.

Saturday at Oatelands the Queen sent for me, and gave thanks for a businesse with which she trusted me; her promise then, that she would be my friend, and that I should have immediate addresse to her, when I had ccasion. All which considered, together with his Chaplaines licencing divers popish Bookes, with their xpunging most passages against Popery out of Bookes brought to the Presse, and other particulars commonly knowne, will give a true Character of his temper, that is another Caander, or middle man betweene an absolute Papist, and a reall Pro∣testant, who will far sooner hug a popish Priest in his bosome, then take  Puritan by the little finger; an absolute Papist in all matters of ceremony, pompe, and externall wor∣ship, (in which he was over zealous, even to an open bitter persecution of all consci∣tious Ministers, who made scruple of them) if not halfe an one at least, in Doctrinall . How far he was guilty of a conditionall voting the breaking up the last Par∣liament before this was called, and for what end it was summoned; this other me∣moriall
under his owne hand will attest, Dec. 5 1639. Thursday, the King declared his resolution for a Parliament, in case of the Scottish rebellion: the first movers to it were my L. Deputy of Ireland▪ my Lord Marquesse Hamilton, and my selfe: And a Resolution voted at the Board to assist the King in extraordinary wayes, if the Parliament should prove peevish and Refuse, &c. But of him sufficient, till his charge (now in prepa∣ration, and since transmitted to the Lords) shall come in. Observations on, and from the relation of this plot. FFom the relation of the former Plot by so good a hand, our own three Realms, and a forraigne Protestant States may receive full satisfaction. First, that there hath been a most cunning, strong, execrable conspiracie long since contrived at Rome, and for divers yeeres together most vigorously pursued in England with all industry, policy, subtilty, engines, by many active, potent con∣federates of all sorts, all sexes, to undermine the Protestant Religion, re-establish Po∣pery, and alter the very frame of civill government in all the Kings Dominions; wherein a most dangerous visible progresse hath been lately made. Secondly, That to effect this traiterous designe, they have not onely secretly ere∣cted some Monasteries of Monkes, Nunnes, in and about London; but sent over hither whole Regiments of most active subtill Iesuits, incorporated into a particular new society, whereof the Pope himselfe is head, and Cardinall Barbarino his Vicar: which Society was first discovered, and some of them apprehended in thir private Col∣ledge at Clerken-well (together with their bookes of account Reliques, and Massing Trinket) about the beginning of the second Parliament of this King; yet such power, favour, friends, they had then acquired, that their persons were speedily and most in∣directly released out of Newgate without any prosecution, to prevent that Parlia∣ments proceedings against them, which examined this abuse, and illegall release. Since which, this conjured society increasing in strength and number, secretly replanted themselves in Queens-street and Long-acre, and their purses are now so strong, their hopes so elevated, their designes so ripened, as they have there purchased, founded a new magnificent Colledge of their owne for their habitation, neere the fairest build∣ings of Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen, the more commodiously to seduce them. Thirdly, that these Iesuits and conspirators hold weekely, constant, uninterrupted intelligence with the Pope and Romish Cardinals; and have many spies or intelligence of all sorts about the King, Court, City, Noblemen, Ladies, Gentlemen of quality, and in all quarters of the Kingdome, to promote this their damnable Plot. Fourthly, that the Pope for divers late yeeres hath had a known avowed Legat, C by name, openly residing even in London, neere the Court, of purpose to reduce the King and his Kingdoms to the obedience of the Church of Rome; and the Queen at least, another Legor at Rome trading with the Pope, to facilitate the designe, to wit, one Hamilton a Scot, who receives a pension out of the Exchequer, granted to another Protestant of that name, who payeth it over unto him, to palliate the businesse from the peoples knowledge; by which meanes there hath been a constant allowed Neg∣tiation held between Rome and England, without any open interruption.
5. That the Popes Legate came over into England to effect this project, and kept is residence here in London, for the better prosecution thereof by the Kings own privity and consent. And whereas byAntiq. Eccles. Brit. p. 322. Ead. lib. 1. and Fox Acts and Mon. Vol. 1. edit. ult. p. 926. the ancient Law and Custome of the Reale et in force, even in times of Popery, no Legat whatsoever coming from Rome. ought to rosse the Seas, or land in England, or any the Kings Dominions, without the Kings own Petition, calling and request to the Pope, and before hee had taken a olemne Oath or Prtestation, to bring and attempt nothing in word or deed, to the prejudice of the Rights, Priviledges, Laws and Customs of the King and Realm. This Legat, for ought appears, was here admitted without any such cautionary Oath, which would have crossed the chiefe end of his legation, which was, to prejudice all men, and our Religion too. Yea, whereas by23. Eliz. c. 1. 35. Eliz. c. 1. 3. Iac. c. 3. 4, 5. the Statutes of the Realm, it is made no lesse then high Treason for any Priests, Iesuits, or others, receiving orders or Authority from the Pope of Rome, to set footing in England, or any the Kings Dominions, to seduce any of his Subjects to Pope∣ry: and Popish Recusants (much lesse then Priests, Jesuits, & Legats) ought not to remain within ten miles of the City of London, nor come yet into the King or Princes Courts, the better to avoid such trayterous and most dangerous Conspirators, Treasons, and at∣tempts as are daily divised and practised by them against the King and Common-weal. Yet notwithstanding, this Popes Legate, and his confederates, have not only kept re∣dence for divers yeeres, in or neer London and the Court, and enjoyed free liberty (without disturbance, or any prosecution of the Lawes against them) to seduce his Majesties Nobles, Courtiers, Servants, Subjects every where, to their griefe and pre∣judice; but likewise had familiar accesse to, and conference with, the King himselfe, (under the name, notion, authority of the Popes Legat) by all Arts, Policies, Argu∣ment to pervert and draw him, with his three Kingdomes, into a new subjection to the Sea of Rome, asSee 1. & 2. Phil. & Mary, c. 8. Cardinall Pool, the last Popes Legat extant in England before this, in Queen Maries raigne, reconciled her and the Realm to Rome, to their intole∣rable preiudice. An act so inconsistent with the Laws of the Realm, with his Ma∣jesties many ancient and late Remonstrances, Oathes, Protestations, to maintaine the Protestant Religion, without giving way to any back-sliding to Popery, in such sort as it was maintained and professed in the purest times of Q. Elizabeth, &c. as may well amaze the world, which ever lookes more at reall Actions, then verball Protestations. 6. That the Popish party & Conspirators, have lately usurped a soveraign power, not only about the Lawes and Magistrates of the Realm (which take no hold of Pa∣pists,See the Royall Popish Favo∣rite. but by the Parliaments late care against them here) but even over the King him∣self; who either cannot, or dares not (for feare, perchance, of poysoning, or other assas∣sination) oppose or banish these horrid Conspirators from his Dominions & Court, but hath a long time permitted them (by vertue of his marriage articles,) to prose∣cute this plot without any publike opposition or dislike, by whose powerfull autho∣rity and mediation, all persons may easily divine. Alas! what shal become of the poore sheepe, when the Shepheard himself, not only neglects to chase and keep out these Ro∣mish wolves, but permits them free accesse into, and harbor in the sheepfold, to assault, if not devour, not only his flock, but Person too? Either SaintIoh. 10. 10. 11, 12, 13. Iohn was much mista∣ken in the Character of a good Shepheard, and prescribing this injunction against such seducers,2 Ioh. 10. 11. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evill deds▪ And theGratian caus. 23. Fathers, the Canonists deceived in this Maxime, Qui non pro∣hibet
malum quod potest, jubet: or else the premises cannot be tolerated or defen∣ded by any who professe themselves enemies or opposites to the Pope, Priests, or Church of Rome; or true Defendrs of the Protestant reformed Religion. 7. That these conspirators are so potent, as to remove from Court and publiqu Offices, all such as dare strenuously oppose their plots, (as the example of Secretary Cooke, with other Officers lately removed in Ireland, the Articles of Pacificatio there lately made with the Rebels, evidence) and plant others of their owne party and confederacie, both in his Majesties Court, Privie Councell, Closet, Bedchamber if not Bed, and about the Prince, to corrupt them: And how those that are th invironed with so many industrious potent seducers of all sorts, who have so many snares to intrap, so many enticements to withdraw them, both in their Beds, Bed∣chambers, Closets, Councels, Courts, where ever they goe or come, should possibl continue long untainted, unseduced, without an omnipotent protection (of which none can be assured, who permits or connives at such dangerous temptations) is thing scarce credible in divine or humane reason, ifGen. 3. Adams,1 King▪ 11. Solomons, and other Apostacies by such means, be duly pondered. He who sailes in the midst of dan∣gerous rocks, may justly feare, and expect aQui amat pe∣riculum peribit in . wracke. 8. That the late Scottish troubles, wars, were both plotted and raised by thes Iesuiticall Conspirators, of purpose to force the King to resort to them and thei Popish party for aid of Men and Money against the Scots; and by colour thereof to raise an Army of their owne, to gaine the King into their power, and then to wi or force him to what conditions they pleased; who must at leastwise promise the an universal toleration of their Religion throughout his Dominions, ere they woul yeeld to assist him. And in case they conquer or prevaile, he must then come fully over to their party, or else be sent packing by them with a poysoned Fig to ano∣ther world, as his Father (they say) was; (its likely by their instruments or procure∣ment, they are so conusant of it, though it might not be examined when complaine of in open Parliament by the Commons, but the Assembly rather dissolved, then death discussed) and then the Prince, yet young, and well inclined to them already b his education, will soon be made an obedient son of the Church of Rome. Thus th Relator, a chiefe actor in this pre-plotted Treason, discovers. And if his single testmony (though out of an wounded conscience) will not be believed alone, the ensu∣ing circumstances will abundantly manifest, the Scottish wars to be plotted and di∣rected by them; For Con the Popes Legate, Hamilton the Queenes Agent, mo of the Iesuites then about London, Captain Read their Host, the Lord Sterling Chamberlaine, Cardinall Richelleiu his Agent, with other chiefe actors in the plot being all Scots, and imploying of Maxfield, and he two other active Popish Sco Lards, in raising these tumults; the Earle of Arundel (another principall mem∣ber of this conspiracie, being by their procurement made Generall of the firs Army against the Scots, and most of his Commanders Papists; the Papists in a counties of England (upon the Queens Letters directed to them) contributin large summes of Money, besides Men, Armes and Horses to maintaine this wa (for which Master Squire of Shoreditch highly commended them in the Pulpi as the Kings best Subjects: See Master Whites first Century of scandalous Priest P. 25) Sir Toby Matthew (the most industrious conspirator, in the packe) makin a voyage with the Lord Deputy into Ireland, to stir up the Papists there to contrbute
Men, Armes, Money, to subdue the Scottish Covenanters; yea, Marquesse Ha∣miltons own Chaplain (imployed as the Kings Comissioner to appease these Scots) holding correspondency with Con, and resorting to him in private, to impart the secrets of that businesse to him, the generall discontent of the Papists and conspira∣tors upon the first pacification of those troubles, which they soon after infringed, and by new large contributions raised a second Army against the Scots, when the English Parliament refused to grant Subsidies to maintaine the war. All these concurring circumstances compared with the relation, will ratifie it without dispute, that this war first sprung from these conspirators. 9. That the subsequent present Rebellion in Ireland, and wars in England, ori∣ginally issued from, and were plotted by the same conspirators. For the Scottish war producing this setled Parliament beyond the conspirators expectation, which they foresaw would prove fatall to this their long agitated conspiracie, if it con∣tinued undissolved; thereupon some Popish Irish Commissioners comming over in∣to England, and confederating with the Dutchesse of Buckingham, Captaine Read (now a prisoner in the Tower, and taken in the field in actuall rebellion in Ireland) and other of these conspirators, who afterwards departed secretly into Ireland, they plotted an universall Rebellion, surprisall and Massacre of all the Protestants in that Kingdome: which, though in part prevented by a timely discoverie, which secured Dublin, and some few places else; yet it tooke generall effect in all other parts, to the losse of above an hundred and fourtie thousand Protestants lives, there mas∣sacred by them. And finding themselves likely to be overcome there by the Parlia∣ments Forces sent hence, and from Scotland, to relieve the Protestant party; there∣upon to worke a diversion, they raised a civill bloody war against the Parliament here in England, procuring the King (after Endymion Porter, a principall conspira∣tor in the Plot, had gained the custody of the great Seale of England) to issue out divers Proclamations under the great Seale, proclaming the Parliament themselves Traytors and Rebells, yea to grant Commissions to Irish and English Papists (contrary to his former proclamations) to raise Popish forces both at home and in forraigne parts for his defence, as his trustiest and most loyall Subjects; to send Letters and Commissions of favour to the Irist Rebels, and hinder all supplies from hence to the Protestant party. And withall, they procured the Queene, by the Earle of Antrim and Dutchesse of Buckinghams mediation, to send Ammunition to the Irist Rebels, and to attempt to raise an insurrection in Scotland too, as the Declaration of the rise and progresse of the Rebellion in Ireland, more largely discovers: since which, his Majesty hath condescended to Articles of Pacification with these Rebels contrary to an act of Parliament, and both Houses consents (wherein they are declared His Majesties GOODSo are th Shrewesbury printed copies. Catholike Subiects of Ireland, and no Rebels at all) and hath sent for many thousands of them into England to massacre the Protestant English here, and fight against the Parliament, as they did in Ireland heretofore. Seeing then all may clearely discerne the exact prosecution of this plot carried on in all these wars by the conspirators therein particularly nominated; by the Queen and Popish partie in all three Kingdomes, and by Papists in forraign parts (who have largely contributed Men, Money, Armes, Ammunition, to accomplish this grand designe, through the instigation of those conspirators in this plot, who are gone beyond the
Seas) and have lately caused publike Proclamations to be made in Bridges, and other parts of Flaunders, in uly last, (as appeares by the Examination of Henry Maye, since seconded by others, That all people who will now give ANY MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE ROMAN CATHOLIKES IN ENG∣LAND, should have it re-payd them againe in a yeeres time, with many thanks;) the whole world must of necessity, both see and acknowledge (unlesse they will re∣nounce their ownn eyes and reason) that this conspiracy and plot, is no feigned im∣posture, but a most reall perspicuous agitated treachery, now driven on almost to its perfection, the full accomplishment whereof (unlesse Heaven prevent it) the Ca∣tholikes of England expect within the circuit of one yeere, as the forenamed Pro∣clamations intimate. 10. That no setled peace was ever formerly intended,See the Royall Popish favo∣rite, where it is largely proved. nor can now be futurely expected in England or Ireland, without an universall publike toleration (at the least) of Popery, and a repeale and suspention of all Lawes against it; this being the very condition in the plot which the King must condescend to, ere the Papists would ingage themselves to assist him in these warres thus raised by them, for this end: and that none may doubt this verity; the late most insolent bold demands of the Irish Rebels in the Treaty with them, the most favourable Articles of Pacifica∣tion granted to them, the present suspention of all lawes against Priests and Recu∣sants in all Counties under his Majesties power; the uncontrolled multitudes▪ of Masses in his Armies, Quarters, Wales, the North, and elsewhere; the open boasts of Papists every where, the introducing of thousands of Irish Rebels, and other Fu∣gitives, to extirpate the Protestant Religion, most really proclaime it: And if the King, after all their many yeeres restlesse labour, plots, costs, paines, and pretended fidelity to his cause against the Parliament, should deny these Merit-mongers, such a diminutive reward as this is, (the very least they will expect▪) now they have him, the Prince and Duke, within their custody, Bristol, Chester, Ireland, Wales, most of the Westerne parts, and all his Forces in their power, this Discoverer (an eye and are-witnesse of destinie from the Legates owne vaunt, will informe his Majesty and all his Protestant Subjects (who will tremble at the very apprehension of it) that they have an Indian poysoned Nut reserved for him amongst this Iesuiti∣call societie; or if it be lost, a poysoned Knife perchance, or some other Instrument, to dispatch him out of the World, and so to get the possession, protection of the Prince, whom they will educate in their Antichristian Religion; which how possible, how probable it is for them (considering their present power and indeavours to effect it, theirGrimston in his life. poysoning of the Emperor, Henry the seventh, in the sacred host; of King Iohn in the Chalice; theirFox, Speed, stabbing of Henry the third of France with a Kife in the belly; of Henry the fourth his successor,Generall hist. of France. in Hen. 3. & 4. first in the mouth, next in the heart-strings; though all of their owne Religion, because they would not humour the Pope in every un∣reasonable demand, (though Henry the fourth turned an Apostate from the Pro∣testant Religion wherein hee was bred, restored the Iesuites formerly banished out of France, rased the Pillar erected in Paris, as astanding Monument of their Trea∣sons against their Soveraignes, and built them a stately Colledge, to secure his life from their Assssination, which yet would not save him from their butchery:) Together with their pistolling of the Prince ofMeterans▪ Grimston. Orange, and poysoning of
See Doctor Egglshams Booke, and the Commons charge against the Duke of Buckingham. King Iames himself (as the Legate boasted) may informe his Majestie, and all his faithfull Protestant Subjects, (especially such as by their confederating with them in these their wars, have done nought, but executed, advanced their fore-named de∣signes, whom it concernes now very neerly to prevent, if possible, such a sad Catastro∣phe of that bloodie Tragedie, which hath been acted overlong in Ireland & England by these Conspirators fore-plotted treasons. The execrable horridnesse and reality whereof, made the very Discoverer of the Plot, out of remorse of conscience, to desert the Conspirators, conspiracie, and that bloody Religion which begot it; and therfore should much more incite all such in his Majesties Army, who are cordially faithfull to their Soveraigne, Religion, Countrey, Posterity, and have hitherto ignorantly acted these conspirators treasonable designes, under colour of serving the King; to consider with remorse of conscience, whose Instruments they have thus long been, whose treasons they have ripened, what Protestant blood they have shed, how much they have weakened, impoverished, betrayed their own Protestant party, who have really stood for God, Religion, King, Countrey, Parliament, against these Romish conspirators; and what hopes, what advantages they have given these confederates, both in England and Ireland, to overtop, suppresse, and ere long, utterly to extirpate the Protestant Religion, themselves, and all other cordially proessing it, as they have done many thousands of them already. And then upon all these sad, most serious considerations (the very thoughts whereof should cause their soules to bleed and tremble) speedily to desert these trayterous Papists, ere they get all into their power, and unite all their heads, hearts, hands, forces to the Parliaments party, who had so good cause to take up defensive arms, to prevent the imminent ruine, which other∣wise is like to befall both King, Kingdome, Religion, Parliament, Liberty, Property, Posterity, ere we be aware; especially, since the most cowardly unworthy yeelding up of Bristoll, a fit Inlet for the maligant Welch Papists, Irish Rebels, (who have con∣spire to come over hither with all expedition, and are lately landed here in great multitudes since the pacification made with them) to cut all our throats. 11. That those Protestants who now side with Popish conspirators, when they have accomplished their designes, whatsoever they may now fancy to themselves, shall find no more mercy or favour from them, then the greatest Roundheads, if they comply not with them in all things, and even in Popery it selfe; for if they will not spare the Kings own person and life, after so many favours, graces extended to them, (as they will not, if we believe this Relation, or the late story of King Henry the fourth of France, yet fresh in memory) what inferiour person can think to be secure, to fare better then the King himselfe? And if Con the Legate, to insinuate himselfe into the Kings and Palatines favours at the fist, when he had no interest in them, would not so much as advie the Legat of Colen, to mediate for the Palsgrave, lest per∣adventure the King of Spaine should report, that the Pope had patronized an hereall Prince, as the Relaion attests, though he promised the King effectually to do it; How can Prince Rupert, Maurice, (or any other Commanders) in the Kings Army, when they have fully accomplished the Popes, and these his Instruments designes (under whose banner they ignorantly, yet really militate and promote his cause, in steed of the Kings and Kingdomes, to whom they and theirs have been so much ingaged)
hope to receive the least dram of favour, pity, muchlesse any recompence from the Pope and Popish party, if they continue hereticks still, notwithstanding all their present goodly promises? Will they (think you) part with any other inheritances to them, then, who will not so much as now mediate for them to regaine their own? Will these who have butchered so many thousands of innocent Protestants in Ire∣land, in England, even before they were sure of the day, without any provocation given; spare any mothers sonne of them alive, if they once erect their Trophees over them? Certainly the experience of all former ages compared with the pre∣sent, may fully resolve all, that the very. 12, 10. tender mercies of these wicked ones, will be nought but extreme cruelty; and if they prevaile, wee all must perish without di∣stinction sooner or later, unlesse wee will turne Apostates, and lose our Religion, God, Heaven, soules, to save our transitory lives. Finally, therefore, let the serious consideration of all the premises instruct us, to learne wisdome from these our adversaries; let their indefatigable industry, subtill policy, sincere fidelity, cheerfull constancy, bountifull liberality, fraternall unani∣mity, undaunted magnanimity, indissolvable confederacy, and uninterrupted perti¦nacie in prosecuting, establishing, propagating their Antichristian Religion, Trea∣sons, designes, excite all Protestants (according to their severall late Covenants and Protestations much forgotten) to equalize, if not transcend them in all these, in de∣fending, securing, propagating our true Christian Religion, protecting our King, Kingdomes, Parliament, Lawes, Liberties, Posterity, all we yet have, or hereafter hope for, from that imminent ruine, which these Popish conspirators threaten to them. Fore-warned fore-armed; if now we perish through our owne private dis∣sentions, folly, cowardize, covetousnesse, trechery, security, or monstrous credulity, that these conspirators and Papists now in Armes, fight onely for the King, and esta∣blishment of the Protestant Religion, as it was in Queen Elizabeths dayes, (against whom they plotted so many Treasons, even for her very Religion, and also the powder-plot since, against King Iames, and the whole Parliament,) our blood shall rest upon our owne heads, who would not take timely notice of our incumbent dangers, nor suddenly prevent them whiles we might. YO have read before in the plot it selfe, what an active instrument Captaine Read was, in promoting this conspiracie of the Iesuites; and how he was intrusted with the dispatch and delivery of all their Letters and Packets of intelligence, and his house the ordinary randevouze where they weekely met; yet see what a Protection this desperate Traytor obtained from his Maiesty, to secure him against all apprehen∣sions and prosecutions to advance this designe, recorded in the Clerke of the Peace hi Book for Middlesex in open sessions, for his greater immunity, and in the Crowne Office. By the King. VVHereas We have received good testimony of the Loyalty and Duty of Our trusty and welbeloved Captaine, Iohn Read; and because he may be subject to the penalty of the lawes for Recusancie. These are to signifie, that We are graciously plased to extend Our speciall Grace towards him: and doe hereby will
