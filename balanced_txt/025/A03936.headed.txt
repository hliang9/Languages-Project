There is two ma¦nere of refourmyng of the ymage of god whiche is man¦nes soule / One is in fulnesse / A nother is in partye / Refourmynge in fulnesse maye not be had in this lyfe / but it is delayed after this lyfe to ye blyse of heuen / whe¦re mannes soule shal fully be refourmed. not to that sta¦te that it had at the fyrste begynnyng by kynde. or my∣ght haue had thorough grace yf it had stonde hole / But
it shal be restored to moche more blysse and moche hyer Ioye thorough the grete mercy & the endles goodnesse of god than it shold haue had yf it had neuer fallen / For then shal the soule receyue the hole & ye ful felyng of god in al mightes of it. without medelyng of ony other affec¦cyon / And it shal see mankynde in the persone of Ihesu aboue ye kynde of angels onyd to the godhede / For then shal Ihū bothe god & man be al in al / & oonly he.Isay.  & none other but he as ye prophete sayth / Dominus solus exal∣tabitur in illa die. That is our lorde Ihesu in that daye yt is euerlastyng daye shal be hyghed oonly. & none but he / And also ye body of man shal then be gloryfyed / For it shall receyue fully the ryche dowary of vndedelynes with al yt longeth therto / This shal a soule haue with ye body / & moche more than I can saye. But that shall be in the blysse of heuen & not in this lyfe. For though it be so yt the passyō of our lorde be cause of al this ful refour¦mynge of mannes soule / neuerthelesse it was not his wyl for to graunte this full refourmynge ryght anone after his passyon to al chosen soules that were lyuynge in tyme of his passyon / But he delayed it vnto the laste daye And that was for this skylle / Sooth it is yt our lor¦de Ihesu Cryste of his mercy hath ordeyned a certayne nomber of soules to salucyō whiche nomber was not fulfylled in the tyme of his passyon / And therfore it ne∣ded that by length of tyme thorough kyndly generyon of men it sholde be fulfylled / Thenne yf it had so be that as sone after the dethe of our lorde euery soule that wol¦de haue trowed in hym sholde by his lyfe haue be blessyd and ful refourmed without ony other abydynge / there wolde no creature that lyued thenne haue be that he ne wolde haue receyued ye faythe for to haue be made bles∣syd / And
thenne sholde generacyon haue ceased. And so sholde we that arne now chosen souled lyuynge and other soules that come after vs not haue ben borne / And so sholde our lorde haue fayles of his nomber / But that maye not be / And therfore our lorde purueyed mo¦che better for vs in that that he delayed the full refour∣myng of mannes soule tyl the laste ende. as saynt poul sayth / Deo pro nobis melius prouidente.Dē br. ne siue nobis consūmarentur / That is. Our lorde purueyeth better for vs in the delaye of our refourmynge than yf he had graunted it thenne / For this skylle that the chosen sou¦les here beforne sholde not make a ful ende without vs that come after / A nother skylle is this / For syth that man in his fyrst fourmynge of god was sette in his free wyl and had free chesynge whether he wolde haue fully god or no. It was therfore resonable that syth he wolde not chee god thenne but wretchydly felle from hym / If he sholde afterwarde be refourmed that he sholde be sette agayne in the same free chesynge that he was fyrst in / whether he wolde haue ye profyte of his refourmyn¦ge or no / And this maye be a skylle why mannes soule was not refourmed fully as faste after the passyon of Ihesu cryste / That refourmyng in party is ī two maners. one in fay¦th another in felynge / Caplm̄ v. ANother refourmynge of this ymage is in par∣tye: and this refourmynge maye be had in this lyfe: and but yf he had in this lyfe it maye neuer be had. ne the soule may neuer be saaf / But this refourmynge is on two maners / One is in fayth oonly. A nother is in fayth and in felynge. The fyrst refourmynge in fay∣th oonly suffyseth to saluacyon / The seconde is worthy
to haue passynge mede in the blysse of heuen / The fyrst maye be hadde lyghtly and in shorte tyme / The secon∣de maye not soo but thoroughe lengthe of tyme and mo¦che ghostly traueyle / The fyrste maye be hadde with the felynge of the ymage of synne / for thoughe a man fele noo thynge in hymselfe but all styrynges of synne and flesshly desyres. not ayenstondynge that felynge / yf he wylfully assent not therto he maye be refourmed in fayth to the lyckenesse of god / But the seconde refo∣urmynge puttyth out the lykynge in felynge of flesshly styrynges and worldly desyres / and suffreth noo suche spottes abyde in this ymage / The fyrste refourmynge is oonly of begynynge and profytynge soules. and of actyfmen / The seconde is of perfyte soules and of con∣templatyfmen. For by the fyrste refourmynge the yma¦ge of synne is not destroyed. but it is lefte as it were all hole in felynge / But the seconde refourmynge destroy¦eth the olde felynges of this ymage of synne / and bryn∣geth in to the soule newe gracyous felynges thoroughe the werkynge of the holy ghoste / The fyrste is good. the seconde is better / but the thyrde that is in the blysse of he¦uen is moost beste / Fyrste lette vs speke of that one and sythe of that other / And soo we shall come to the thyrde / That thorough the sacrament of baptym yt is grounded in the passyon of cryst this ymage is refourmed fro ory¦gynal synne / Caplm̄ vi TWo manere of synnes makyth a sole to lese ye shape & the lyknesse of god. That one is called orygynal yt is ye fyrst syn. thother is called actuel yt is wyl¦fully done syn. thise ii. syn̄es put away a soule fro ye blys¦se of heuē. & dāpneth it to thēdles payn of hel. but if it be
thorough the grace of god refourmyd to his lyckenesse or it passe hens out of this lyfe / Neuertheles two reme∣dyes arne there ayenst thyse two synnes / by yt whiche a forshapen soule maye be restored agayne / One is ye sa∣cramente of baptym ayenste orygynal synne / a nother is the sacramente of penaunce ayenst actuel syn̄e / A sou¦le of a chylde that is borne and is vncrystenyd by cause of orygynal synne hath no lyckenesse of god / He is nou¦ght but an ymage of the fende & a bronde of helle. But as soone as it is crystened it is refourmed to the ymage of god / and thorugh the vertue of fayth of holy chyrche sodeynly it is tourned fro the lyckenesse of ye fende & ma¦de lyke an angel of heuen. Also ye same falleth to a Iewe or to a sarazyne the whiche or they ben crystened arne nought but mancyples of helle / But whan they for∣saken her errour & fallen mekely to the trouthe in cryste and receyue the baptym of water in the holy sthost. soth¦ly without ony more taryenge they arne refourmed to the lyckenesse of god soo fully as holy chyrche troweth. that yf they myghte as soone after baptym passe out of this worlde. they sholde streyght flee to heuen withoute ony more lettyng / had they done neuer so moche synne before in the tyme of her vntrouthe / & neuer sholde they fele the paynes of helle ne of purgatory / And ye pryuele∣ge sholde they haue by the meryte of crystis passyon / That thorough the sacrament of penaunce ye stondeth in contrycyon confessyon & satysfaccyon this ymage is refourmed fro actual synne / Caplm̄ vii ALso what crysten man or woman yt hath lost ye lyckenesse of god thoroughe a dedely synne bre∣kynge goddis commaundementes / yf he thoroughe to wchynge of grace sothfastly forsake his synne with
sorowe and contricyon of herte. and be in ful wyl for to amende hym / and torne hym to good lyuynge / And in this forsayd wyl receyueth the sacramente of penaunce yf he maye / Or yf that he maye not he is in wylther∣to. Sothly I saye that this mannes soule or womans yt was forshapen fyrste to the lyknesse of the deuyl thorou¦gh dedely synne is nowe by the sacrament of penaunce restored and shapen ayen to the ymage of our lorde god This is a grete curtesye of our lorde and an endles mer¦cy that so lyghtly foryeuyth al maner of synne / and soo sodeynly yeuyth plente of grace to a synful soule that as¦kyth mercy of hym / He abydeth not grete penaunce do¦ynge ne paynful flesshly sufferyng or he foryeue it / But he askyth a lothynge of synne & a ful forsakynge in wyl of the soule for the loue of hym and a tournyng of ye hert to hym / This askyth he / for this yeuyth he / And then̄e whan he seeth this withoute ony delayenge. he foryeuy¦th the synne and refourmyth the soule to his lyknesse / The synne is foryeuen that the soule shal not be damp∣ned / Neuerthelesse the payne detted for the synne is not yet fully foryeuen / but yf contrycyon & loue be the more And therfore shal he go and shewe hym & shriue hym to his ghostly rader. and receyue penaūce enioyned for his trespaas. and gladly fulfyl it. so that bothe the synne & ye payne maye be done awaye or he passe hens / And that is the skylful ordynaunce of holy chyrche for grete profy¦te of mannes soule that thoughe the synne be foryeuen thorough the vertue of contrycyon / neuerthelesse in ful¦fyllynge of mekenesse: and for to make hole satysfaccy∣on he shal yf he may shewe to his preste plener confessyō for yt is his token & his warraunt of foryeuenesse ayen∣ste al his enmyes. and yt is nedefull for to haue / For yf a
man had forfeyted his lyfe ayenst a kyng of this erthe it were not ynough to hym as for a fulsykernesse for to ha¦ue on̄ly foryeuenesse of the kynge / but yf he haue a char¦ter the whiche may be his token & his warraunt agayn¦ste al other men / Ryght so maye it be sayd ghostly / If a man haue forfeyted agaynst the kynge of heuen his lyfe thorough dedely synne / It is not ynough to hym to ful¦sykernesse for to haue foryeuenes of god oonly by con∣trycyon betwene god and hym. but yf he haue a charter made by holy chyrche yf he maye come therto And that is the sacrament of penaunce the whiche is his charter & his token of foryeuenes / For syth that he forfeyted bo¦th ayenste god and holy chyrche it is skylful that he ha∣ue foryeuenesse for that one and a warrant for ye other / And this oo skylle why that confession is nedeful / A no¦ther skylle is this / For syth this refourmyng of the soule stondyth in fayth oonly & not in felyng / therfore a flessh¦ly man that is rude & boystouse & can not deme lyghtly but outwarde of bodely thynges sholde not mow haue crowyd yt his synnes had ben foryeuē hym but yf he had some bodely token. and that is confessyon thorough the whiche token he is made ll syker of foryeuenes yf yt he do that in hym is / This is the trouth of holy chyrche as I vnderstonde it / Also a nother skylle is this / Though the grounde of foryeuenesse stonde not pryncypally in confessyon but in contrycyon of ye herte. and in forthyn kynge of synne / neuertheles I hope that there is many a soule that sholde neuer a felyd very contricyō. nor had full forsakynge of synne yf confessyon had not be / For it fallyth oft sythes that in the tyme of coufessyon grace of compunccyon comyth to a soule that before neuer fe¦lyd grace. but euer was colde and drye and ferder fro fe¦lyng
of grace / And therfore syth confessyon was so pro¦fytable to the more partye of crysten men holy chyrche ordeyned for the more sykernesse generally to al crystē men that euery man & woman sholde ones in the yere at the lest be shryuen of all her synnes that come to her mynde to her ghostly fader. though they had neuer soo moche contrycyon before tyme / Neuertheles I hope wel that yf al men had ben as besye aboute the kepyng of themselfe in eschewynge of almaner of synne / And had comyn to as moche grete knowynge and felyng of god as some man hathe / That holy chyrche sholde not haue ordeyned the token of confessyon. as for nedeful bonde for it had not neded / But for al men arne not so perfyte. and perauenture moche of the more partye of crysten men is vnperfyte. therfore holy chyrche ordey∣ned confessyon. by waye of general bonde to al crysten men that wyl knowe holy chyrche as her moder. & wol be buxome to her byddynge / If this be soth as I hope it is then erreth he gretely that generally sayth that con∣fessyon of synnes for to shewe a preste is neyther nede∣ful to a synner ne behoful / and that no man is bounde therto / For by that that I haue sayd it is both nedeful & spedful to al soules that in this wretchyd lyfe are defoy¦led / thorough synne / and namely to those yt arne thorou¦gh dedely synne forshapen fro the lyknes of god whiche mye not be refourmed to his lykenesse but by the sacra∣ment of penaunce that pryncypally stondeth in contry¦cyon and sorowe of herte / and secundary in shryfte of mouthe folowynge after yf it maye be hadde / Upon this mauere by this sacrament of penaunce is a synful soule refourmed to the ymage of god and to hys lycke∣nesse /
¶How in the sacramente of baptym and of penaunce thorough a preuy vnperceyuable worchynge of the ho¦ly ghost this ymage is refourmed though it be not seen ne felt / Calpm̄ viii BUT this refourmange stondeth in fayth & not in felyng / For ryght as the propyrte of the fayth is for to trowe yt thou seest not. ryght so it is for to trowe ye thou felyst not. But he yt is refourmed in his soule by ye sacrament of penaunce to ye ymage of god he felyth no chaūgynge in hymself neyther in his bodely kynde with¦out ne in the pryue substaunce of the soule within other than he dyde. for he is as he was vnto his felynge / and he felyth the same styrynges of synne & the same corrup¦cyon of his flesshe in passyons & worldly rysynge in his herte as he dyde before / And neuertheles he shal trowe yt he is thorugh grace refourmed to ye lyknes of god thou¦gh he nother fele it ne see it / He may wel fele sorowe for his synne & a tornyng of his wyll fro syn̄e to clēnesse of lyuynge yf yt he haue grace & take good kepe of hymselfe but he may nother see ne fele the refourmyng of his sou¦le how it is wonderly & vnperceyuably chaunged fro ye fylthe of the fende vnto the fayrnes of an angel thorou¦gh a pryue gracyous werchyng of the holy ghost. That maye he not see but he shal trowe it / And yf he trowe it. then is his soule refourmed in trouthe. For ryght as ho¦ly chyrche trowith by ye sacrament of baptym sothfast∣ly receyued a Iewe or a sarasyn or a chylde borne is re∣fourmed in soule to the lyckenesse of god thorough a pry¦ue vnperceyuable werthyng of the holy ghost / not ayē stōdyng al ye flesshly styrynges of his body of syn. ye whi¦che he shal fele after his baptim as wel as he dyde before Ryght so by ye sacrament of penaūce mekely & truly re∣cōmaundement

¶The cause why so fewe soules in rewarde of yt multy¦tude of other comen to this refourmg in fayth & in felyn¦ge. Caplm̄ xviii BUt now sayst thou / Syth our lorde is so curteys of his goodnes. & of his gracyous yeftes so free / wonder it is then that so fewe sowles as it semyth in re∣warde of the multytude of other maye come to this re∣fourmynge in felynge / It semyth yt he were dangerous & that is not sothe / or that he toke no rewarde of his crea¦tures. the whiche by takyng of fayth are become his ser¦uauntes / Unto this I may answere & saye as me thyn∣keth. that one enchesen is this / Many that are refour∣med in fayth setten not her hertes for to profyte in gra∣ce. ne for to seke none hyer estate of good lyuynge thoru¦gh besye traueyle in prayeng a thynkyng. and other bo¦dely & ghostly werkynge / but hem thynke it ynough to hem to kepe hemselfe out of dedely synne. & for to stonde stylle in that plyght as they are in / For they saye that it is ynough to hem for to be saaf and haue the leest degre in heuen / They wol coueyte no more / Thus perchaun¦ce dooth some of the chosen soules that leden in the worl¦de actyflyfe / and that is lytyl wonder of hem / For they are so occupyed with worldly besynesse that nedeth for to be done that they maye not fully sette her hertes for to profyte in ghostly we tkynge / And neuertheles it is pe∣ryllous to hem. for they falle out al daye / and are nowe vp. & now downe. & maye not come to the stablenes of gode lyuyng. Neuertheles they are somwhat excusable for her astate of lyuynge / But other men & wymmen yt are free fro worldly besynesse yf they woll & maye haue her nedeful sustynaunce without grete bodely besynes specyally as relygyous men & wymmen may that byn∣den

For a soule may not ston¦de styl alwaye in one state whyle that it is in the flesshe / For it is eyther profytynge in grace or peyrynge in syn̄e For it fareth by hym as it dooth by a man that were dra¦we out of a pytte. & whan he were vp he wolde no ferder go than ye pyttes brynke / Sothly he were a moche foole for a lytyl puffe of wynde or an vnwarly styryng of hȳ selfe sholde soone caste hym downe ayen wors than he was byfore / Neuertheles yf he fle fro ye brynke as ferre as he maye & go forth on the erthe. then though there co¦me a grete storme he is the more syker. for he falleth not in the pytte / Ryght so ghostly. he that is drawen out of ye pytte of synne thoroughe refourmynge of faythe / and whan he is our of dedely synne he thynketh hymselfe syke ynoughe / And therfore he wol not profyte but holde hym stylle as he is by the pyttys brynke as nere as he maye sothely he is not wyse / For atte the leest temptacyon of hys enmye or of hys flesshe he falleth in to synne ayen / But neuerthelesse yf he flee fro the pytte. that is yf he sete his herte fully for to com̄ to mo∣re grace. and for to traueyle besyly howe he maye come therto. & yeue hym hertly to prayeng. thynkyng & other

And how wylful bode∣ly customes indyscretly rewarded & vsed somtyme hyn¦dren soules fro felyng of more grace / Caplm̄ xix ANother enchesen is this. Some mē that are re∣fourmed in fayth in the begynnynge of her tor∣nyng to god setten hemself in a certayn maner of doyng whether it be bodely or ghostly. & thynken euer for to ke¦pe that maner of worchyng forth / & not for to chaunge it for none other ye comith thorugh grace though it were better. for they wene that yt doynge sholde be beste for hē alwaye for to holde / & therfore they resten hem therin. & thorough custome they bynde hem so therto that whan they haue fulfylled it they thynke hem wonderly eased / For they wene that they haue done a grete thyng to god And perchaunce yf it falle that they be letted fro ye custo¦me
though it be for a skilful cause. they ben heuy and an¦gry. and haue troublynge of conscyence▪ as yf they had done a grete dedely synne. Thyse men hyndren hemself somwhat fro felyng of more grace. for they sette her per¦feccyon in a bodely werke. and so they make an ende in the myddes of the waye where none ende is / For why bodely customes that men vse in her begynnyng are go¦od / but they are but meanes & wayes ledynge a soule to perfeccyon / And therfore he that sayth his perfeccyon ī a bodely werke or in a ghostly werke that he felych in ye begynnynge of his tornynge to god. and he woll no fe∣der seke but euer rest therin. he hyndreth hymselfe gret∣ly / For it is a symple crafte that a prentyse is euer in ly∣ke wyse in / and that can on the fyrste daye as moche of it as he can thyrty wynter after / Or elles yf the craft be good and subtyl he is of a dulle wytte or elles of an euyl wyl that profyteth not therin / But thenne it is soth yt of al craftes that are. the seruyse of god is moost souerey¦ne & the moost subtyl: the hyghest & hardest for to come to the perfeccyon of it / And also it moost profytable and moost of wynnyng to hym that maye soth fastly perfor¦me it / And therfore it semyth that the prentises of it that are euer ylyke ferforth in lernynge eyther are they dulle wytted or elles euyll wylled / I repreue not thyse custo∣mes that men vse in the state of begynnynge whether they ben bodely or ghostly / for I say that they are ful go¦od & spedfull for hem for to vse / But I wolde that they helde hem not but as a waye & an entre towarde ghostly felynge. and that they vsed hem as a couenable meane tyl a better come / and that they in vsynge of hem couey¦ted after better / And then̄e yf better come that were mo¦re ghostly and more drawynge in the thought frō flessh¦lynes
& fro the sensualyte & vayn ymagynacion. yf that sholde be letted by cause of her customes yt they leue then her custome whan it maye be lefte without scaunder or dysease of other. and folowe that they fele / But yf ney∣ther lette other then that they vse bothe yf they maye. I meane not of customes nedeful thorugh bonde of lawe or of rule or of penaunce / but of other wylfully taken / Thus techeth vs the prophete in the sawter sayeng th{us} Etem̄ benediccionem dabit legislator ibunt de virtute in virtutem videbitur deus deo{rum} in syon / That is:p̄. lxxx iii. So¦thly the brynger of the lawe shal yeue blessyng they shal go fro vertue in to vertue / and god of goddys shal be see in syon / The brynger of the lawe. that is our lorde Ihe∣su cryst shal yeue his blessynge / That is: He shal yeue hys grace to his chosen soules. callynge hem fro synne and ryghtynge hem by good werkes to his lyckenesse / thorugh whiche grace they shall proufyte and wexe fro vertue to vertue tyll they come to syon / that is tyl they come to contemplacyon / in the whiche they shal see god of goddys. That is: They shal see wel that there is not but one god / ¶How that without moche bodely & ghostly besynes & without moche grace & mekenesse soules may not be re¦fourmed in felynge / ne kepe therin after they come ther¦to / Caplm̄ xx NOw sayest thou. Syth it is so that refourmyng in faythe is so lowe and so peryllous for to rest in by cause of drede of fallynge agayne / And refourmyn∣ge in felynge is so hyghe and so syker / who so myght co∣me therto. Thenne coueytest thou for to wyte what ma¦nere traueyle were moost spedful for to vse / by the whi∣che
a man myghte prouffyte in. and come therto. Or yf there were ony certayne traueyle or specyal dede by the whiche a man myght come to that grace and that refo∣urmynge in felynge / As vnto this I saye thus / Thou wotest wel that what man or woman wol dyspose hym for to come to clennesse of herte and to felynge of grace hym behoueth haue moche traueylle and grete fyghtyn¦ge in wyl and in werke lastyngly agaynste wycked sty∣rynges of al the hede synnes / Not oonly ayenste pryde or Enuye but ayenst al other with al the spyces that co∣men oute of theym / as I haue sayde before in the fyrste wrytyng. For why / Passyons and flesshly desyres lette the clennesse of the herte and pees in conscyence / And hym behoueth also for to traueyle for to gete al vertues Not oonly chastyte and abstynence / but also pacyence and myldenesse / charite and mekenesse and al the other And this maye not be doon by one maner of werke / but by dyuerse werkes and many after sundry dysposycy∣ons of men / As nowe prayenge: nowe thynkynge now worchynge some good werkes / nowe assayenge theym selfe in dyuers wyse / In hunger: in thruste: in colde: in sufferyng of shame and dyspyte yf nede be / And in other bodely dysease for loue of vertue and sothfastnesse / This knowest thou wel / for this redest thou in euery bo¦ke that techeth of good lyuynge / Thus sayth euery mā that wol styre mennes soules to the loue of god / And so it semyth that there is no specyal traueyle ne certeyn de¦de thorugh whiche oonly a soule myght come to yt grace but pryncypally thorugh grace of our lorde Ihesu. & by many dedes & grete in al yt he may done. & yet al this is ly¦tyl ynough / And one skylle may be this. For sith our lor¦de Ihū hymself is specyal mayster of this crafte: & he is
specyal leche of ghostly lyknes: for without hym al is no¦ught. it is therfore resonable that after that he techeth & styreth so a man folowe and werke / But he is a symple mayster that can not teche his dyscyple whyle he is ī ler¦nynge but euer one lesson / & he is an vnwyse leche that by one medecyne wol hele al sores / Therfore our lorde Ihesu that is so wyse & so good for to shewe his wysdom & his goodnes he techeth dyuers lessons to his dissyples after yt they profyte in her lernynge. & yeueth to dyuers soules sere & dyuers medycynes after the felynge of her syknes / Also a nother skylle is this: If there were ony certayne dede by the whiche a soule myghte come to the perfyte loue of god then sholde a man wene that he my∣ght come therto by his owne werke & thorugh his owne traueyle as a marchaunt comyth to his mede by his ow¦ne traueyle oonly & by his owne werke / Nay it is not so ghostly in the loue of god. For he that wol serue god wy¦sely & come to perfyte loue of god. he shal coueyte to ha∣ue none other mede but hym oonly / But then for to ha¦ue hym may no creature deserue oonly by his owne tra¦ueyle / For though a man myght traueyle as moche bo∣dely & ghostly as al creatures that euer were myghte he myght not deserue oonly by his werkes for to haue god to his mede: for he is souereyn blysse & endles goodnes & passyth without cōparyson al mēnes desertes. & ther¦fore he may not be gotē by no mannes specyal werkes as bodely mede may / For he is free and yeuyth hymsefe whet̄he wol. & whan he wol. neyther for this ne for yt / ne this tyme ne after yt tyme / For though a soule worche all ye he can & may al hys lyfe tyme / Perfyte loue of Ihe¦su shall he neuer haue tylle oure lorde Ihesu woll free∣ly yeue it / Neuertheles on that other syde I saye also I
hope he yeuyth it not but yf a man worche & traueyle al that he can & maye. ye tyll hym thynke he maye no mo¦re / or elles be in ful wyl therto yf he myght / And so it se∣myth yt neyther grace oonly without ful worchynge of a soule that in it is / ne worchynge alone without grace bryngeth a soule to the refourmynge in felynge / yt whi∣che refourmyng stondeth in perfyte loue & charite / But that one Ioyned to that other / that is grace Ioyned to worchynge bryngeth in to a soule the blessyd felynge of perfyte loue / the whiche grace may not restfully but on meke soules yt ben ful of yt drede of god / Therfore maye I saye: he yt hath no mekenes ne dooth his besynes may not come to this refourmyng in felyng / He hath not ful mekenes yt can not fele of hymselfe soth fastly as he is / As thus / He that dooth al the good dedes that he can / as in fastyng: wakyng: weryng of the heyre. & al other suf∣fryng of bodely penaunce / or dooth al ye outwarde wer¦kes of mercy to his euen rrysten: or elles Inwarde / as prayenge: wepyng: syghyng / & thynkyng yf he rest euer in hem & leue somoche to hem: & rewardeth hem so gret∣ly in his owne syght yt he presumyth of his owne deser∣tes. and thynketh hymselfe euer ryche & good holy & ver¦tuous / sothly aslonge as he felyth thus he is not meke y∣nough / Ne though he say or thynke yt al that he dooth is of goddis yeft & not of hymself. he is not yet meke ynou∣gh for he maye not yet make hymself yet naked of al his good dedes / ne make hym poore sothfastly in spyrite / ne fele hymselfe nought as he is / And sothly vntyll a soule can fele ably thorugh grace nought hymself. and baren hym fro all the good dedes that he dooth thorugh behol∣dynge of sothefastnes of Ihesu he is not perfytly meke / For what is mekenes but sothfastnes / Sothly nought

Aīa mea desyderauit te in nocte: sed & sp̄us meus ī p̄cordiis meis That is. Lorde Ihesu the mynde of the is prynted in de¦syre of my soule / For my soule hath desyred the in the ny¦ght. and my spyryte hath coueyted the in al thynkynges And why the prophete sayth he hath desyred god al in ye nyght as a tymful space bytwyx dayes two / For whan one daye is ended a nother comyth not anone / but fyrst comyth nyght & departeth the dayes somtyme longe & somtyme shorte / and thenne after comyth a nother day The prophete meaned not on̄ly of this maner of nyght but he meaned a ghostly nyght / Thou shalt vnderston¦de that there ben two dayes or two lyghtes / The fyrste is a fals lyght. the ecōde is a true lyght / The fals lyght is the loue of this worlde that a man hathe in hymselfe of corrupcyon of hys flesshe. The true lyght is the per¦fyte loue of Ihesu felyd thorugh grace in a mannes sou¦le. The loue of this worlde is a false lyght / For it passeth
awaye and lasteth not / and so it perfourmeth not that that it behoteth / This lyght behyght the fende to Adam whan he styre hym to synne and sayd thus / Gen̄. 3 Aperientur oculi vestri et eritis sicut dii / That is / your eyen shal be opened and ye shal be as goddys / And he sayd sothe the¦re For whan Adā had synned anone his Inner eye was sperred & ghostly lyght withdrawe. & his vtter eye were opened / & he felt and sawe a new lyght of flesshlh lykyn¦ge and worldely loue that he sawe not before / And soo sawe he a new day but this was an euyl daye / For thys was it that Iob waryed whan he sayd thus / Pereat di∣es in qua natus sum / That is:Iob 3. Perysshe the daye in the whiche I was borne / He waryed not the daye rennyn∣ge in the yere that god made / but he waryed this daye that man made. that is the concupyscens and the loue of this worlde in the whiche he was borne thorough he felyd it not. Then this daye and this lyghte he asked of god that it sholde perysshe and noo lenger laste / But the euerlastin¦ge loue of Ihesu is a true daye and a blessyd lyght / For god is bothe loue and lyghte. and he is euerlastyngr as saynt Iohn̄ sayth / Qui diligit deum manet in lumine / That is:p̄ Ioh.  He that loueth god dwellyth in the lyght Than what man perceyueth and seeth the lone of this worlde fals and faylynge. and for that he woll forsake it and seke the loue of Ihesu / He maye not assone fele the loue of hym / But he muste abyde a whyle in the nyghte / For he maye not sodeynly come fro that one lyghte to that other / that is from the loue of the worlde to perfy∣te loue of god / This nyghte is noughte elles but a forberynge and a withdrawynge of the thoughte and of the soule fro erthly thynges by grete desyre and yernynge for to loue and

But this is a good nyght & a lyght derknesse & for it is a stoppyng out of the fals lo¦ue of this worlde. and it is a nyghynge of the true daye And sothly ye derker yt this nyʒt is ye nerer is ye true daye of the loue of Ihū / For the more that ye soule maye tho∣rugh longyng to god be hydde fro noyse & dyn̄e of flessh¦ly affeccyons & vnclene thoughtes the nerer it is for to fele the lyght of ye loue of hym for it is euen at it. Thus semyth it the prophete meaned whan he sayd thus. Cū in tenebris sedeo dn̄s lux mea est.

For that preuy truste our lorde leueth
in suche a soule goo he neuer soo ferre fro it. by the why¦che the soule is borne vp fro dispeyre & saued fro ghost∣ly myscheyf. And also wythout itselfe it shal be mortify¦ed and pyned in the sēsualyte / eyther by dyuers syknes or by feable tourment of the fende. or elles thrugh a pre¦uy myghte of god the sely soule by felynge and berynge of the wretched body shal be soo pyned. And it shal not wyte how that it shall mow suffre for to be in the boy ne were that our lorde Ihesu kept it therin / And yet ne∣uertheles had the soule leuer for to be in alle this pyne than for to be blinded wyth the fals loue of the worlde. for that were helle to suche a soule / But the sufferynge of this manere pyne is noughte but purgatory / & ther∣fore he suffryth it gladly / & he wolde not putte it awaye though he myghte / for it is soo prouffytable / All this do¦oth oure lorde in grete prouffyte of the soule / for to dry∣ue it oute of the sēsualyte / that it myghte receyue ghost∣ly lyghte / For after this whan the soule is thus mortyfi¦ed and brought fro worldly loue in to this derknesse / yt it hathe noo more sauour ne delyte of worldly lykynge than of ye strawe / But he thynkye it bytter as wormo¦de / Thenne commyth the thirde tyme of magnyfieng / And that is whan the soule is refourmed in felynge in partye. and receyueth the yefte of perfeccyon and the grace of contemplacyon / and that is a tyme of grete re¦ste / for thenne is Ihesu more homely with a soule / And after this comyth the fourth tyme of gloryfyenge / That is whan the soule shall be fully refourmed in the blysse of heuen / For thyse soules that arne thus called fro synne and thus ryghted or elles on other maner ly∣ke by dyuers assayenge bothe thoroughe fyre and wa∣ter. and afterwarde are thus magnyfyed they sholde be gloryfyed / For our lorde shal then yeue hē fully yt they
here coueyted / and more than they cowde couete / for he shall areyse hem aboue al other chosen soules to the euē hede of cherubyn and seraphyn / sythen they passed all other in knowynge and louyng of god here in this lyfe / Therfore he that woll come to this magnifyeng drede not this rightyng / for that is the way / For our lorde sayth by his prophete a worde of grete confort to all su¦che soules that are examined wyth fyre of tribulacyon thus / Puer meus noli timere.Isa. xliii.

BUt now sayest thou how maye this be sothe For there are many soules newe tourned to god that haue many ghostly felynges Some haue grete compun¦ction for her synnes. and some haue grete deuocyons & feruours in her prayers. and often haue sundry techin¦ges of ghostly liʒte in vnderstonding: and some men ha¦ue other maner felynges of confortable hete and grete swetnes / and neuertheles thise soules come neuer fully in this restfull derkenes that I speke of wyth feruent de¦syre and lastyng loue and thought in god: Then̄e askest thou whether thise soules be reformed ī felynge or nou¦ghte / It semeth yes. in asmoche as they haue suche gre∣te ghostly felynges that other mē that stōde only ī fayth fele not of / Unto this I maye saye as me thynkith that
thise ghostly felynge whether they stonde in compuncti¦on or deuocyon or in ghostly ymaginacyon are not the felynges whyche a soule shal haue and fele ī the grace of contemplacion / I say not but they are sothfast and gra¦cyously yeuē of god / But thyse soules that felen suche are not yet refourmed in felynge: ne they haue not yet y• yefte of perfecciō ne ghostly the brenninge loue of. Ihū as they maye come to / And neuertheles often it semyth otherwyse: that suche soules fele more of the loue of god thā other that haue the yefte of perfeccyon / in asmoche as the felyng shewyth more outwarde by grete feruour of bodily tokens. in wepynge prayenge knelinge & spe∣kynge and other bodily styrynge. soo ferforth that it se∣myth to a nother man that they were euer rauysshed in loue / And though me thynkith it is not soo / wel I wote that thise maner felinges and feruours of deuociō and compunccion that thise men fele are gracious eftes of god sent in to chosē soules for to drawe hē out of world¦ly loue and flesshly luste that hath ben longe tyme roted in her hert. fro the whiche loue they sholde not be drawē out but bi suche feable stirynge of grete feruours: neuer theles yt the feruours is somoche in outwarde shewyng it is not on̄ly for mochenes of loue yt they haue but it is for litylnes and weyknes of her soule that may not bere a lityl towching of god for it is yet as it were fleshly fest¦ned to the flesshe & neuer was yet departed fro ghostly mortifyeng: and therfore the lest towching of loue and the lest sperkyl of ghostly lyʒte sent fro heuen in to suche a soule is so moche & so comfortable & so delectable ouer al the likinge that euer it felte before in flesshly loue of er¦thly thynge yt it is ouertaken with it / And also it is so ne¦we and sodeyn and so vnkouth that it maye not suffre for to bere it but brestyth and shewyth out in wepynge
sobbyng & other bodily stirynge / Right as the costrell yt is olde whan it receyueth new wine that is fresshe And myghty: the costrel boyleth oute and is in poynte for to cleue and brest vntyl the wyne hath boylled and spour¦ged oute al vnclennesse / but also sone as the wyne is fy¦ned and cleryd thenne it stondeth styl aud the costrel ho¦le / Right so a sonle that is olde thrugh synne whan it re¦ceyueth a lytyl of the loue of god that is soo fresshe and so myghty yt the body is in poynte, for to cleue & to breke ne were that god kepith it hole / But yet it brestyth oute at the eyen by weping. and at ye mouth by spekyng. and yt is more for weyknes and feblenes of the soule thā for mykylnes of loue / For afterwarde whan loue hath boy¦led al the vnclennes oute of the soule bi suche grete fer∣uours then is the loue clere & stondeth styl: And then is both the body and the soule moche more in pees and yet hath the soule moche more loue than it had before thou∣gh it shewelesse outwarde / For it is now al hole in reste wythin. and noughte but lityll in outwarde shewynge of feruour / And therfore I saye yt thyse soules yt fele su¦che grete hodily feruours though they bē in moche gra¦ce are not yet refourmed in felynge but they are gretely dysposed towarde.

Caplm̄ xxx
IT nedeth a soule that wolde haue knowynge of ghostly thynges for to haue firste knowynge of it self / For it maye not haue knowyng of a kynde aboue it self but yf it haue knowynge of itself / And that is whan the foule is soo gadred ī to itself / and departed fro behol¦dynge of al erthly thynges & fro the vse of bodely wittes that it felyth itself as it is in the owne kynde without a body / Thenne yf thou coueyte for to knowe and see thy soule what it is. thou shalte not torne thy thought with ymaginacion in to thy body for to seke it and fele it as it were hyd within thyn herte. as thy herte is hydde & hol∣den within thy body / If thou seke soo thou shalt neuer fynde it in itselfe / The more thou secheste for to fynde & fele it as thou woldest fele a bodily thyng the ferder thou arte therfro / For thy soule is no body but a lyfe vnsea∣ble. not hyd and holden with in thy body as a lesse thyn¦ge is hyd & holden within a more but it is holdynge and quyknyng thy body moche more thā thy body is in my¦ght & in vertue / Then yf thou wolt fynde it withdraw thi thoughte fro al bodily thynge outwarde & fro myn¦de of thyn owne body. also fro al thy fyue wyttes asmo∣che as thou maye. and thynke on the kynde of a resona∣ble soule ghostly as thou woldest thynke for to knowe ony vertue as sothfastnes or mekenes or ony other ver∣tue / Righte soo thynke that a soule is a lyfe vndedely & vnseably / & hath myght in itself for to see and knowe the soueryn sothfastenes. And for to loue the souereyne goodnes yt is god / whan thou seest this then felyst thou somwhat of thyself / Seke thyself in none other place / but ye more fully & ye more clerly yt thou maye thynke of the kynde and the worthynes of a resonable soule what it is and what is ye wyndly werkynge of it ye better seest thou thiselfe / It is ful hare for a oule that is rude and
moche in the flesshe for to haue syghte and knowynge of it or of an angel or of god / It falleth anone in to yma¦gynacion of bodily shappe. and it weneth therby for to haue the sighte of it selfe. and so of god and soo of ghost∣ly thynges / And that maye not be / For alle ghostly thin¦ges are sene and knowen by vnderstonding of the soule not by ymaginacion / Ryght as a soule seeth by vnder∣stōdyng that the vertu of right wysnes is for to yeue to euery thynge that it oweth to haue / right soo & on suche a maner maye the soule see itselfe by vnderstondynge / Neuertheles I saye not that thy soule shall reste stylle in this knowinge / bue it shal by this seke hyer knowynge aboue itselfe & that is the kynde of god / For the soule is but a myrour in the whyche thou shalt see god ghostly / And therfore thou shalt fyrste fynde thi myrrour & kepe it bryghte & clene fro flesshly fylth & worldly vanytee / & holde it well vp fro the erthe that thou myʒt see it & our lorde therin also▪ For to this ende traueylen all chosen soules in this lyfe in her meaning & in her entēt though they haue not specyally the felinge of this. And therfore it is said before that many soules begin̄yng & profiting haue many grete feruours & moche swete deuociō and as it semith brēnynge al in loue. & yet haue they not per¦fytly loue ne ghostly knowynge of god / For wyte thou well fele a soule neuer somoche feruour / somoche that him thinkyth that ye body may not bere it. or though he melte al in to wepynge. aslonge as his thynkyng & his beholdyng of god is moost. or al in ymagynacion & not in vndstōdyng he come not yet to prrfyte loue ne to cō∣tēplacion / For thou shalt vndstōde yt the loue of god is on thre maner wyse / Al are good. but echone is better thā other / The fyrste comyth on̄ly thrugh fayth wyth∣out gracious ymaginaciō or ghostly knowyng of god /
This loue is in the leest soule that is refourmed in fay∣th in ye lowest degree of charyte / And it is good: for it suf¦fyceth to saluacyon: The seconde loue is that a soule fe∣lyth thorugh fayth & ymagynacyon of Ihū ī his manhe¦de. This loue is better than the fyrste whan the ymagy¦nacyon is styred by grace / for why the ghostly eye is ope¦ned in beholdynge of our lordes manhede / The thyrde loue that the soule feleth thorugh ghostly syght of ye god hede in the manhede as it maye be seen here / that is best and wooste worthy / and that is perfyte loue this loue a soule felyth not vnto it be refourmed in felyng / Soules begynnyng & profytyng hath not this loue. for they can¦not thynke on Ihū ne loue hym goodly but as it were al¦manly & flesshly after the condycyons & lyknes of man and vpon that rewarde they shape al her worchynge in her thoughtes & in her affeccyons / They drede hym as a man & worshyp hym & loue hym pryncypally in māly ymagynacyon & go no ferder / As thus: If they haue do¦ne amysse and trespased ayenst god they thynke then ye god is wrothe with hem as a man sholde yf they had tres¦passed ayenst hym. & therfore they falle downe as it we∣re to the fete of our lorde with sorowe of herte and cryen mercy / And whan they done th{us} they haue a good trust y• our lorde of his mercy wol foryeue hem her trespasse / This maner of doyng is ryght good / but it is not gho¦stly as it myghte be / Also whan they woll worshyp god they present hem in her thought as they were before our lordes face in a bodely lyckenes. & ymagyne a wonder∣ful lyght there our lorde Ihesu is / and thenne they reue∣rence hym & worshyp hym & drede hym / & fully put hem in his mercy for to do with hem what he wol / Also whā they wol loue god they beholde hym worshyp hym & dre¦e hym as a man. not yet as god in man eyther in hys
passyon or in some other thyng of his manhede and in y• beholdinge they fele her hertes moche stired to that loue of god / This manere of worchynge is good & gracyous but it is moche lesse and lower than is the worching of vnderstondynge / That is whan the soule gracyously beholdeth god in man / For in our lorde Ihesu are two kyndes. the manhede. and the godhede / Thenne ryght as the godhede is more souereyne and more worthy thā is the manhede / Ryght so the ghostly beholdynge of the godhede in Ihesu mā is more worthyer. and more ghost stlyer. and more medeful than ne beholdyng of the man¦hede alone / whether he beholde the manhede as dedly or as gloryfyed / And ryght so by the same skyl the loue y• a soule felyth in thynkyng and beholdynge of the godhe∣de in man whan it is gracyously shewed is worthyer ghostlyer & more medeful than the feruour of deuocyon that the soule feleth by ymagin̄acyon oonly of the man: hede shewe it neuer somoche outwarde / For in rewarde of that this is but manly / for our lorde sheweth hym not in ymaginacion as he is. ne that he is / for the soule myght not that tyme for freelte of the flesshhede suffre it soo / Neuerthels vnto suche soules that can not thynke of the godhede ghostly that they sholde not erre in her de¦uocyon. but that they sholde be comforted & strengthed thrugh some maner Inwarde beholdynge of Ihū for to forsake synne and the loue of the worlde. therfore oure lorde Ihesu tempreth his vnseable lighte of his godhede and clotheth it vnder bodile lykenes of his manhede. and she wyth it vnto the Inner eye of a soule. and fedeth it wyth the loue of his precyous flesshe ghostly / The whiche loue is of soo grete myghte that it sleeth all wyc∣ked loue in the soule and strengthe it for to suffre body∣ly penaunce and other bodyly dysease in tyme of nede /
for loue of Ihesu / And this is the shadowyng of our lor¦de Ihesu ouer a chosen soule. in the whiche shadowyng the soule is kepte fro brennyng of worldly loue. For ry∣ght as a shadowe is made of a lyght & of a bodi: ryght so this ghostly shadow is made of ye blessed vnseable lyght of the godhede & of the manhede ooned therto shewed to a deuout soule / of the whiche shadowe the prophete say¦th thus / Sp̄s ante faciē nostram xp̄s dn̄s sub vmbra ei{us} viuemus inter gentes / Our lorde cryst before our face as a spyrite vnder his shadowe we shal lyue amonge fol¦ke / That is our lorde Ihesu in his godhede is a spyryte that maye not be seen of vs lyuyng in flesshe as he is in his blessed lyght. therfore we shal lyue vnder ye shadow of his manhede as long as we are here But though this besooth yt this loue in ymaginacyon be good / Neuerthe¦les a soule sholde desyre for to haue ghostly loue in vnder¦stōdyng of the godhede. for that is the ende & ye ful blysse of the soule / and al bodely beholdynges are but meanes ledynge a soule to it / I say not that we sholde refuse the manhede of Ihesu and departe god fro man. but thou shalt in Ihesu man beholde drede. wonder. & loue ghost¦ly the godhede. And so shalt thou without departyng lo¦ue god in man. and both god & man ghostly & not flessh¦ly / Thus taught our lorde mary mawdeleyne that shol¦de be contemplatyfe.Ioh. x whan he sayd thus / Noli me tan∣gere non dūenē ascendi ad patrē meū Touche me not I am not yet styed vp to my fader / That is to saye: Mary magdalene loued wel our lorde Ihesu before the tyme of his passyon / but her loue was moche bodely & lytyl gho¦stly / She trowed wel yt he was god but she loued hym a lytyl as god / for she kouth not then̄e / and therfore she suffreth al her affeccyon and al her thought falle in hym as he was in fourme of man / And our lorde blamed her
not thenne but praysed it moche / But after whan he was rysen fro dethe and appered to her she wolde haue worshypped hym with suche manere loue as she dyde before / and thenne our lorde forbode her and sayd thus Towche me not: That is. Sette not thy reste ne the lo∣ue of thyn herte in that fourme of man y• thon seest with thy flesshly eye only for to reste therin. For in that four me I am not styed vp to my fader That is I am not euē to the fader. for in that fourme of man I am lesse than he: Towche me not so. but let thy thought and thy loue in ye fourme in whiche I am euen to the fader / that is ye fourme of the godhede / and loue me: knowe me. & wor∣shyp me as god & man godly. not as a man manly / So shalt thou touche me. For sythen I am both god & man and al the cause why I shal be loued & worshipped is for I am god: and for I toke the kynde of man. And therfo¦re make me god in thyne herte and in thyne loue / And worshyppe me in thyne vnderstondynge as Ihesu god and man: souereyne sothfastnes and souereyne good∣nes and blessed lyfe for that I am / And thus taughte our lode her as I vnderstonde and also al other soules that arne dysposed to contemplacyon and able therto that they sholde doo soo. Neuertheles other soules that arne not sybtyll in kynde. ne are not yet made ghostly thoroughe grace it is good to hem that they kepe for the her owne worchynge in ymagynacyon with manly affeccyon vnto more grace come freely to hem. It is not syker to a man to lene one good thynge vtterly tyll he see and fele a better. Upon the selfe wyse it maye be sayd of other maner felinges that are like to bodyly / as herynge of delectable songe. or felynge of comfortable hete in the body: seenge of lighte. or swetnes of bodili sa¦uour. Thyse are not ghostly felynges. for ghostly clyn
are felte in the myghtes of the soule / pryncipally in vnderstondynge & loue. and lytyl in ymagynacyon / But thise felynges are felte in the myghtes of the body in ymagynacyon / and therfore they are not ghostly fe∣lynges. But whā they are best & moost true. yet are they but outwarde tokens of the Inly grace that is felte in ye myghtes of the soule / This may be openly preued by ho¦ly wryt sayeng thus / Apparuerūt appostolis dispertite¦lingue tāqm̄ ignis.Act. sed it{que} supra singulos eorum spiri∣tus scūs / The holy ghost appered to the apostles in the daye of penthecost in the lickenes of brennynge tonges & enflammed her hertes. & et vpon eche of hem / Now soth it is the holy ghost that is god in hymselfe vnseable was not that fyre ne the tonges that were seen. ne that brennyng that was felt bodily. but he was vnseabli felt in the myghtes of her soules / for he lyghtned her reason and kyndeled her affeccion thrugh his blessed precense so clerely and so brennyngly that they had. sodeynly the ghostly knowyng of sothfastnes & ye perfeccyon of loue as our lorde behyght hem sayenge thus / Spiritus san∣ctus docebit vos omnem veritatem / That is.Ioh. the holy ghost shal teche you al sothfastnes / then was that fyre and that brennyng nought elles but a bodily token out¦warde shewed in wynessynge of that grace that was Inwardly felte / And as it was in hem / soo is it in other soules that are vysyted and lyghtned within of the holy ghost. and hath with that suche outwarde felynge in cō¦forte and wytnessyng of the grace inwarde / But that grace is not as I hope in all soules that are perfyte but there our lorde wol / Other Inperfyte soules that haue suche felynges outwarde and haue not yet receyued In¦warde grace it is not good to hem to reste in suche felyn¦ges outwarde / but in as moche as they helpe the soule to
more loue. and to more stablynesse of thoughte in god / For some maye be true and some may be feyned as I ha¦ue sayd before / ¶How this maner of spekynge of refourmyng in felin¦ge of a soule shal be take And on what wyse it is refour∣med and how it is founde in saynt poules wordes.

Capitulum. xxxii A Soule yt is called fro the loue of worlde & after yt is ryghted & assayed. mortifyed & puryfyed as
I haue before sayd: our lorde Ihū of his mercyful good¦nes refourmyth it in felyng whan he wouchyth saaf He openeth the Inner eye of the soule whan he lyghtneth ye reasn̄ thrugh towychynge and shinynge of his blessyd lyght for to se hym and knowe hym. not al fully at ones but lityll and lityll by dyuers tymes as the sowle maye suffre hym / He seeth hym not what he is. for that maye noo creature doo in heuen ne in erthe: Nor he seeth hym not as he is / for that syght is oonly in the blysse of heuē But he seeth hym. yt he is an vnchaungable beynge / a souereyne myght: souereyne sothfastenes: souereyne go¦odnes: a blessed lyf: an endles blysse / This seeth ye soule and moche more that comyth wyth al not blyndly and nakydly & vnsauourly as doth a clerke that seeth hym by his clergye on̄ly thorugh myght of his naked reason but he seeth hym in vnderstondynge that is comforted & lyghted by the yefte of the holy ghost with a wōderful reuerence and a preuy brennyng loue. and wyth ghost∣ly sauour & heuenly delyte more clerly & more fully thā it maye be wrytē or sayd / This syghte though it be but shortly & lytyl is so worthy & so myghty that it draweth and rauyssheth al the affecciō of the soule fro beholding & the mynde of al erthly thynge therto for to reste therin euermore yf it myghte / And of this manere of syghte & knowynge the soule groundeth al his worchyng inwar¦de in al the affeccions / For thenne it dredeth god in mā as sothfastnesse wondreth hym as myghte / loueth hym as goodnes / This syghte and this goodnes and this knowynge of Ihesu with the blessed loue that comyth out of it may be called refourmyng of a soule in felynge and in fayth that I speke of / It is in fayth / For it is derke yet as in rewarde of that ful knowynge of Ihū wyih the blessed loue that comith
onte of it yt shal be in heuen / For then shal we se hym not oonly yt he is but as he is / As saynt Iohn̄ sayth / Tunc videbimus eum sicut est / That is:p̄. Io. iiii. Thenne shal we see hym as he is / Neuertheles it is in felynge also as in re∣warde of ye blynde knowynge that a soule hath stondyn¦ge oonly in faythe / For this soule knowyth somwhat of the very kynde of Ihesu god thorughe his gracyous syght / but ye other knowyth not. but oonly trowith it is soth. Neuertheles yt thou ye better maye conceyue what I meane I shal shewe thyse thre maner refourmyng of a soule by ensāple of thre men stondyng inlyʒt of the son Of the whiche thre one is blynde a nother may see but he hath his eyen stopped / the thyrde lokyth forth full sy∣ght / The blynde man hath no maner knowyng that he is in the son̄e / but he trowith it yf a true man telle hym And he betokeneth a soule that is oonly refourmed in fayth yt trowyth in god as holy chyrche techeth & wote not what / This suffyceth as for saluacyon / That other man seeth a lyght of the sonne. but he seeth it not clerly what it is for the lyd of his eye letteth hym that he maye not see / But he seeth thorugh the lyd of his eye a glyme∣rynge of grete lyghte / And he betokeneth a soule that is refourmed in fayth and in felynge / and soo is he con¦templatyfe. For he seeth some what of the godhede of Ihesu thoroughe grace / Not clerly ne fully. for the lyd∣de that is hys bodyly kynde is yet a walle bytwyxe hys kynde and the kynde of Ihesu god and lettythe hym frome the clere syghte / But he seeth thoroughe thys walle after that grace towchyth hym more or lesse that Ihesu is god. and that Ihesu is souereyne good nesse and souereyne beynge. and a blessyd lyfe / and all that other goodnesse comyth of hym / Thus see∣the the sowle by grace notayenstondynge
the bodily kynde. and the more clene and subtyl that the soule is made. and ye more it is depared fro flesshly hede the sharper sight it hath & the myghtyer loue of the god∣hede of Ihesu / This syght is so myghty that thoughe none other man lyuynge wolde trowe in Ihesu ne loue hym he wolde neuer trowe the lesse ne loue hym the lesse for he seeth it sothfastly that he may not vntrowe it / The thyrde man yt hath ful syght of the sonne he trowith it not / for he seeyth it fully / And he betokeneth a ful bles¦syd soule that without ony walle of body or of synne see¦th openly the face of Ihesu in the blysse of heuē / There is no fayth / & therfore he is fully refourmed in felynge / There is no state aboue the seconde refourmyng that a soule may come to here in this lyfe. for this is the state of perfeccyon & the way to heuen warde. Neuertheles al ye soules that are in this state are not al lyke ferforth. For some hath it lytyl shortly & seeldom. & some lenger clerer and oftiner: and some hath it best clerest and lengest af∣ter ye aboundyng of grace / & yet al thyse haue the yefte of contemplacion / For the soule hath not perfyte syght of Ihesu al at ones / but fyrst a lytyl & a lytyl / and after yt it profyteth and comyth to more felyng / And aslonge as it is in this lyfe it maye waxe more in knowyng & in this loue of Ihesu / and sothly I wote not what were more le¦yf to suche a soule that hath felte a lytyl of it than vtter∣ly al other thynges lefte and sette at nought. Tent on̄∣ly therto for to haue clerer syght & clenner loue of Ihesu in whō is al the blessed trynyte / This maner knowyng of Ihesu as I vnderstonde is the openynge of heen to the eye of a clene soule of the whiche holy mē speke of in her wrytynge / Not as some wene that the openynge of heuen is as yf a soule myghte see bi ymaginaciō thrugh the scyes aboue the fyrmament how our lorde Ihesu sye¦teth
in his mageste in a bodily lighte as moche as an hundreth sonnes Nay it is nat soo. ne though he see ne¦uer so hyghe on that maner sothly he seeth not the gost¦ly heuen / The hygher he styeth aboue the sonne for to see Ihesu god so by suche ymagynaciō the lower he fal¦leth bineth the sonne. Neuertheles this maner syght is sufferable to sīple soules that can noo better seche him that is vnseable. ¶Howe Ihū is heuen to the soule. And why he is cal∣led fyre / Caplm. xxxiii. WHat is heuen to a resonable soule / Sothly noughte elles but Ihesu god / For yf that be heuē only that is aboue al thyng / then ne is god onely heuen to mānes soule for he is onely aboue the kīde of a soule / thē∣ne yf a soule may thorugh grace haue knowynge of ye blessed kynde of Ihesu sothly he seeth heuē for he seeth god / Therfore there are many men that erren in vn∣derstōdynge of some wordes that are sayd of god / for they vnderstonde them not gostly / Holy wrytynge say¦th that a soule that woll fynde god shall lyft vpwarde the Inner eye & seke god aboue itselfe / Thenne some mē that wolde doo after this sayenge vnderstōde this worde aboue hemself as for hygher settynge in stede & worthynes of place as one elemente or planete is abo¦ue a nother in settyne & worthynes of a bodely place / But it is nat soo gostly. For a soule is aboue al bodily thynge that by settynge of stede: but by subtyltee & wor¦thynes of kynde / Right soo on the selfe wise god is a∣boue all bodily & gostly creatures not by settynge of stede but by subtyltee & worthynes of his vnchangea∣ble blessyd kynde. And therfore he that wol wisely see he god & fynde hym he shall not renne out wt his thought as he wolde clyme aboue the sonne & parte the firma∣ment
and ymagyn that mageste as it were of an hun∣dred sonnes / he shall rather drawe downe the sonne & al the fyrmamēt and forget it. and caste it beneth hym there he is. and sett all and all bodily thinge also at no∣ught / And thynke thenne yf he can ghostly both of him selfe and of god also / And yf he doo thus: thenne seeth the soule aboue it selfe / thenne seeth it in to heuen. Up∣on this self maner shall this worde within be vnder∣stond / It is comynly sayd that a soule shall see our lord within all thynge and within itselfe / Soth it is yt our lorde is within all creatures / but not on that maner yt a kernell is hyd wythin the shell of a nutte. or as a ly∣tyll bodily thynge is holdon within a nother moche / but he is within all creatures as holdynge and kepyn¦ge hem in her beynge thrugh subtyltee and myghte of his owne blessed kynde & clennes vnseable / For right as a thynge that is moost precyous and moost clene is layed nerest / Right soo by that lyknes it is sayde that the kynde of god that is moost precyous moost clene & moost goodly ferrest fro bodily hede is hydde within al thynges / And therfore he that woll seke god wythin he shall forgete fyrste all bodily thynges for all that is wt out. and his owne body / and he shall forgete thīkynge of his owne soule. and thynke on the vnmade kynde. that is Ihesu yt made hym: quiknith hym. holdith hym and yeueth hym reason & mynde and loue the whiche is within hym thrugh his myghte and souereyne sub∣tylte / Upon this maner shall the soule doo whan gra∣ce towchyth it. or elles it woll but lytell auayle to sehe Ihesu. And to fynde hym wythin it self and wythin al creatures as me thīkyth / Also it is sayd in holy wryte that god is lyghte / Soo sayth saynt Iohn̄.p̄. Iohīs Deus lux ī That is. God is lyghte / This lyght shall not be vnder¦stonde as for bodily lyghte. but it is vnderstonde thus /
God is lyghte. That is. God is trouth ang sothfastnes for sothfastnes is ghostly lyghte / Thenne he that most gracyously knowyth sothfastnes best seeth god / ād ne∣uertheles it is lykened to the bodily lyght for this skill Ryght as the sōne sheweth to the bodily eye itself and all bodily thynge by it / rihht so sothfastnes that is god sheweth to the reason of the soule itselfe fyrste. and by itselfe al other gostly thynge that nedeth to ye knowyn¦ge of a soule / Thus sayth the prophete / Domine in lu∣mine tuo videbim{us} iumē / Lorde we shall see thy lyght by thy lyghte / That is:p̄. xxxv. we shal see the that art sothfast¦nes by thyselfe / On the selfe wyse it is sayd that god is fyre / Deus nost ignis consumens est:Hebr̄. xii. That is. Our lorde is fyre wastynge / That is for to saye. God is not fyre elementare that heteth a body and brēneth it. but god is loue and charyte / For as fyre wasted all bodily thynge yt may be wasted / Ryght soo ye loue of god brē∣neth & wasteth all synne out of the soule. And maketh it clene as fyre makyth clene all maner metalle / Thy∣se wordes and alle other that arne spoken of our lorde in holy wrytte by bodely lyckenesse muste nedes be vn¦derstonde ghostly. Elles there is noo sauour in hem / Neuertheles the cause why suche manere wordes are sayd of our lorde in holy wrytte is this / For we are so flesshly that we can not speke of god ne vnderstonde of hym but yf we by suche wordes fyrst be entred in / Ne¦uertheles whan the Inner eye is opened thrugh grace for to haue a lytyll syght of Ihesu / Thenne shall the soule torne lyghtly ynough all suche wordes ye whiche of bodily thynges in to ghostly vnderstondynge. This ghostly openynge of the Inner eye in to knowynge of the godhede whiche I calle refournynge in fayth and felynge / For thenne the soule the whiche somwhat fe∣leth in vnderstondynge of that thynge whiche yt it had
before in naked trowynge. and that is the begyn̄yng of contemplaciō / of the whiche saynt poul sayth thus / Non contēplātibm nobis q̄ vidētur sed q̄ non vidētu Quia que videntur temporalia sunt. que autem non videntur eterna sunt / That is:S. co{rum} iiii. Our contemplaciō is not in thynges that are seen. but it is in thynges vnsea¦ble / For thynges that are seen are passyng. but vnsea∣ble thynges are euerlastyng / to the whiche syghte eue¦ry soule sholde desyre for to come to both here in party and in the blysse of heuen fully / For in that syght & in that knowyng of Ihū is fully the blysse of a resonable soule & endles lyfe Thus saith our lord / Hec est autem vita eterna vt cognoscant te verum deum & quem mi¦sisti Ihesū xp̄m / That is:Iohn̄ vii. Fader thys is endles lyfe yt thy chosen soules knowe the and thy sone whom thou haste sente one sothfaste god. ¶ Of two maner of loue refourmed & vnfourmed what it meanith / And how we be beholde to loue Ihe¦su moche for our makynge / but more for our ayen by¦eng / but althermooste for our sauyng thrugh ye yeftes of his loue. Caplm. xxxiiii. BUt nowe wondrest thou sythen this knoweng of god is the blysse & ye ende of a soule? why thē∣ne haue I sayde here before that a soule sholde not elles coueyte but oonly the loue of god / I spake no thynge of this sighte yt a soule sholde coueyte this / Unto this maye I saye thus / that the syght of Ihesu is full blysse of a soule: and that is oonly for the lyght but it is also for the blyssed loue that comith out of that syght / Ne∣uertheles for loue comyth out of knowynge & not kno¦wynge out of loue / therfore it is sayd that in knowyn∣ge & in syght pryncipally of god with loue is the blys∣se of a soule and the more he is knowen the better he is loued. But for asmoche as to this knowyng or to this
oue that comith of it. may not the soule come without oue / therfore sayd I that thou sholdest coueyte loue / or loue is cause why a soule comyth to this knowyng nd to this loue that comith of it / And on what man̄ hat is I shall telle the more openly. Holy wryters sayē  soth it is that ther is two maner of gostly loue / One s called fourmed. a nother is called vnfourmed / ¶Loue vnfourmed is god hym self the thirde perso∣e in trynyte that is the holy gost / He is loue vnfour∣ed & vnmade as saīt Io. sayth / De{us} dileccō est / God s loue:p̄. Io. iiii. That is the holy gost / Loue fourmed is the af∣fecciō of the soule made by the holy ghost of the syghte and of the knowyng of sothfastnes that is god. oonly tyred and sette in hym / This loue is called fourmed or it is made by the holy ghost / This loue is not god n hymself for it is made. but it is the loue of the sowle ellte of the syght of Ihesu & stired to hym oonly / Now ay thou see that loue formed is not cause why a sou∣e comyth to ye ghostly syghte of Ihesu / And some men wolde thynke that they wolde loue god soo brēnyngly as it were by theyr owne mighte. that they were wor∣thy for to haue the ghostly knowynge of hym / Naye it is not soo. But loue vn vnformed that is god hymself is cause of all this knowynge / For a blynde wretched soule is so ferre fro the clere knowynge and the blessed felynge of his loue thorugh synne and freelte of the bo¦dily kynde that it myght neuer come to it. ne were it ye endles mochenes of the loue of god. But thēne by cau¦se he loueth vs soo moche therfore he yeueth vs his lo∣ue that is the holy ghost / He is the yeuer and the yeft. and maketh vs thenne by that yefte for to knowe and loue hym / Lo this the loue that I spake of that thou sholdest oonly coueyte and dysyre this vnfourmed lo∣ue that is the holy ghost / For sothly a lesse thynge or a
lesse yefte than he is maye nat auayle vs for to brynge vs to the blessed syght of Ihū / And therfore sholde we fully desyre and aske of Ihesu oonly this yeft of loue yt he wolde for the mochenes of his loue so blessed touch our herte wyth his vnseable lyghte to the knowynge of hym and departe wyth vs of his loue yt as he loueth vs that we myght loue hym ayen / Thus sayth saynt Iohn̄ / Nos diligam{us} deum qm̄ ipse prior dilexit nos That is:. Iohn̄. Loue we god now for he fyrst loueth vs / He loued vs moche whan he made vs to his lyknes. But he loued vs more whan he bought vs wyth his precy∣ous blode thrugh wylfull takynge of deth in his man hede fro the power of the fende and fro the pyne of hell but he loueth vs moost whan he yeueth vs the yefte of the holy ghost that is loue. be yt whiche we knowe him and loue hym. and are made syker that we are his so∣nes chosen to saluacion / For this loue are we more to hym boūde thā for ony other loue that euer shewed he for vs. eyther in our makynge or in our ayenbyenge / For though he had made vs and bought vs: but yf he saue vs with all? what profyteth it elles to vs our ma∣kynge or our byenge / Sothly ryght nought / Therfo the mooste token of loue shewed to vs as me thynketh is this / That he yeueth hīselfe in his manhode to ou soules / ¶He gaaf hym selfe fyrste in his māhede to e for our Raunson whanne he offred hymselfe to the fa∣der of heuen vpon the awter of the crosse ¶This was a ryght fayre yefte and a ryght grete to¦ken of loue / But what tyme he gyueth hymselfe in his godhege ghostly to our soules for our saluacion / And maketh vs for to knowe hym. and for to loue hym / Thenne louyth he vs fully / For thēne yeueth he hym¦selfe to vs / And more myght he not yeue vs / Ne lesse myghte not suffyce to vs /
¶ And for this skylle it is sayd that the ryghtynge of a synfull soule thorugh foryeuenesse of synnes is are∣ted and appropered pryncypally to the worchynge of the holy ghoste / For the holy ghost is loue / And in the ryghtynge of a soule our lorde Ihesu sheweth to a sou∣le moost of his loue / For he doth awaye all synne and onyth it to hym / And that is the beste thynge that he maye doo to a soule / And therfore it is appropred to the holy ghost / The makynge of the soule is appropred to the fader. as for the souereyne myghte and power yt he shewyth in makynge of it / The byenge of it is aret∣ted to the sone as for the souereyne wytte and wysdo∣me that he shewed in his manhede / For he ouercome the fēde pryncypally thrugh wysdome and not thrugh strenghte / But the ryghtynge and the full sauynge of a soule by foryeuenesse of synnes is approprede to the thyrde persone that is the holy ghoste / For therin she∣weth Ihesu mooste loue vnto mannes soule / And for that chynge shall he be mooste loued of vs ayen / His makynge is comen to vs and to all vnresonable crea∣tures / For as he made vs of noughte▪ soo made he hem And therfore is this werke greteste of myghte. but not mooste of loue / Also the byenge is comen to vs and to all resonable soules / as to Iewes and saracyns and to fals crysten men / For he deyed for all soules ylyke / and bought hem. yf they woll haue the perfyte loue of it / & also it suffyceth for the bienge of al though it be so that al haue it not / And this werke was most of wysdome not most of loue / But the ryghtynge and the halowyn¦ge of our soules thrugh the yefte of the holy ghost. that is oonly in that worchynge of loue. And that is not co¦men to all but it is a specyall gyfte oonly to them whi¦che be chosen soules / And sothly that is mooste wor¦chynge
of loue to vs that are his chosen chylderne. ¶This is the loue of god that I spake of whiche thou sholde coueyte and desyre: for this loue is god hymself & ye holy gost This loue vnformed whā it is yeuē to vs it worheth in our soule all ye gode is & all ye longeth to godenes / This loue loueth vs or that we loue hym for it clēseth vs fyrst of our synnes: and maketh vs for to loue hym. & maketh our wyll stronge for to ayenstond all synnes / and styreth vs for to assaye our self thrugh dyuers exercyse both bodily & gostly in all vertues / It stireth vs also for to forsake the synne and flesshly af∣feccions and worldly dredes / It kepeth vs fro malycy¦ous temptacions of the fende. and dryueth vs out fro besynes & vanyte of the worlde. and fro conuersacion of worldly louers / All this dooth the loue of god vnfor¦med whā he yeueth hymself to vs / we do right nought but suffre hym and assente to him. for that is the moost that we doo that we assente wylfully to his gracyous worchynge in vs / and yet is not that wyl of vs but of his makynge. so that me thynketh that he dooth in v all that is well done. & yet see we it not / And not oonly dooth he thus. but after this loue dooth more. for he o∣peneth the eye of the soule. and shewith to ye soule that syght of Ihesu wonderfully. and the kowynge of him as the soule maye suffre it thus by lytyll and by lytyll. and by that syghte he rauyssheth all the affeccion of the soule to hym & thenne begynneth the soule for to kno∣we hym ghostly and brynnyngly for to loue hym / Thīne seeth the soule somwhat of the kynde of the blessed godhede of Ihesu howe that he is all and that he wor∣cheth all. and that all gode dedes the whiche are done and gode thouhtes are oonly of hym for he is all seue∣reyn myght & all souereī sothfastnes & al souerein god∣nes / & therfore euery gode dede is don̄ of him & by him &
he shal oonly haue the worship & the thanke for all good dedes and noo thynge but he / For though wretched mē stele his worchypp here for a whyle / Neuerthelesse att the laste ende shall sothfastnesse shewe well that Ihesu dyde alle. And man dyde ryght uoughte of hym selfe / And thenne shall theues of goddes that are not acorded wyth hym here in this lyfe for her trespaas be demyd to deth & Ihū shal be fully worshipped & thanked of al bles¦sed creatures for his worchynge / This loue is not elles but Ihesu hymself that for loue worcheth al this ī man∣nes soule. and refourmeth it ī felynge to his lykenes as I haue before sayd and somwhat as I shall saye / This loue bryngeth in to the soule the full hede of all vertues and makyth al clene and true soft and easy. and torneth him al in to loue and in to likynge / And on what maner wyse he dooth that: I shall telle the a lytyll after warde / This loue drawyth the soule fro vayne beholdynge of worldly thynges in to contemplacyon of ghostly creatu¦res and of goddis pryuites / fro flesshlihede in to ghostly¦nes / fro erthly felynge in to heuenly sauour / ¶ How that some soule loueth Ihū by bodily feruours & by her owne manly affeccions that ben styred by gra∣ce and by reason / And how some louen Ihesu more rest fully by ghostly affeccyons oonly styred Inwarde thru¦gh specyally grace of the holy ghost. Capitulum xxxv. THēne maye I saye that he that most hah of this loue here in this lyfe most pleseth god. and most clere sighte shal haue of hym / and moost fully loue hym in the blysse of heuen / for he hath the most yeft of loue he¦re in erth / This loue may not be had by a mānes owne traueyle as some wene / It is freely had of the gracyous yefte of Ihesu after moche bodyly and ghostly traueyle
goyng before For there are some louers of god yt maken hymself to loue god as it were by her owne myght / for they streyne hemself thrugh grete vyolence and panten so strongly that they brast in to bodily feruours as they wolde drawe downe god fro heuen to hem / And they sayen in her hertes and wyth her mouthe / A lorde I lo∣ue the and I wolde loue the: I wolde for thy loue suffre deth / And in this maner of worchynge they fele grete feruour & moche grace / And soth it is me thynketh this worchynge is gode and medfully yf it be well tempred wyth mekenes & with dyscrecion / But neuertheles thy¦se mē loue not ne haue not the yefte of loue on that ma∣ner as I speke of: ne they aske it not soo / For a soule that hath the yeft of loue thrugh gracyous beholding of Ihū as I meane or elles yf be haue it not yet / but wolde haue it. he is not besy for to strayne hymself ouer his myghte as it were by bodyly strength for to haue it by bodyly fer¦uours: and soo for to fele the loue of god but hym thyn∣keth that he is ryght nought. and that he can doo ryght noughte of hymselfe. but as it were a dede thyng oonly hangyng & borne vp by the mercy of god / He seeth well that Ihū is al and dooth all. and therfore asketh he nou¦ghte elles but the yefte of loue / Horly thē that the soule seth that his owne loue is nou¦ghte therfore it wolde haue his loue for that is ynough / Therfore praieth he and that desireth he that the loue of god wolde towche hym with his blessed lyghte that he myghte see a lytyll of hym by his gracyous presence: for then sholde he loue hym / And soo by this waye comyth the yefte of loue that is god in to a soule / The more that a soule nough yth itself thorugh grace by syght of his so¦thfastnes some tyme wythoute ony feruour outwarde shewed. and the lesse yt it thynkith that it loueth or seeth
god. the nerer it nygheth for to precyue the yefte of the blessed loue / For then is loue mayster & worcheth in the sowle: and maketh it forgete itselfe. and for to se & behol¦de on̄ly how loue doth / And then is ye soule more suffryn¦ge than doyng. and that is clene loue / Thus saynt poul meaned whan he sayd thus.Ro viii Quicū{que} sp̄u dei agunt hii filii dei sunt / All thise that are wrought wyth the spyry¦te of god are goddes sōnes. yt is soules yt are made so me∣ke & so buxom̄ to god that thei werke not of hemself. but suffre ye holy ghost styre hem & worche hem in the felyn¦ges of loue wyth a swete corde to his styrynges / Thyse arn specyally godd is sōnes most lyke vnto hym. Other soules that can not loue thus buttraueylen hēself by her owne afflyccyōs & styre hȳself thrugh her owne thinkyn¦ge of god & bodyly exercyse for to drawe out of hēself by mastry ye felīg of loue by feruours & other bodily sygnes loue not ghostly / they done wel & medful yf so yt they wol know ekly yt her werching is not ye kyndly gracyous felyng of loue. but it is manly doyng by a soule at ye byd¦dyng of reason / & neuertheles thrugh ye godenes of god by cause yt the soule doth y• in it is. thyse māly offeccōns of ye soule styred in to god by mannes werchyng are or¦ned in to ghostly affeccyons. and are medeulas yf they had he done ghostly in the fyrste begynnynge / And this is a grete curtesye of oure lorde shewed to meke soules that torneth all thyse manly affeccyons of kyndely loue in to the affeccyon and in to the mede of his owne loue: As yf he hadde wroughte hym all fully by hymselfe / And soo thyse manly affeccyons soo tourned maye be called affeccyons of ghostely loue thoroughe purchase not thoroughe kyndely bryngynge fourthe of the holy ghoste / I saye not that a soule maye worche suche man¦ly affeccyons oonly of itselfe without grace / for I wot
wel that saynt paul sayth that we maye ryght noughte done thynke that gode is of ourself without grace Non en̄iqd sum{us} sufficientes cogitare aliquid ex nobis qua si ex nobis. co{rum} 3 sed sufficiencia na ex deo est / That is▪ we ye loue god wene not yt we suffyse for to loue or for to thyn¦ke good of ourselfe oonly / but our suffysynge is of god / For god worcheth in al both good werke and good wyl as saynt poul sayth / Deus est qui eperatur in nobis et velle & perficere probona voluntate / That is:Phil.  It is god that worcheth in vs good wyl and fulfyllynge of good wyl / But I saye that suche affeccyon are good made by the wyll & meane of a soule after the general grace that e yeueth to al chosen soules / not of specyal grace made ghostly by towchynge of his gracyous presence as he worcheth in his perfyte louers as I sayd before / for n vnperfyte louers loue worcheth ferly by the affeccyons of man. but inperfyte louers loue worchyth nerely by her owne ghostly affeccyons: & sleeth in a soule for ye ty∣me al other affeccyons bothe flesshly kyndly & manly. & yt is propeely the werchynge of loue by hymselfe / Thus loue maye be had in a lytyl in partye here in a clene sou¦le thrugh ye ghostly syght of Ihū. but in ye blysse of heuē it is fulfylled by clere syghte of his godhede / For there shall none affeccyon be feled in a soule but godly and ghostly / ¶That the yefte of loue amonge al other yeftes of Ihū is worthyest & moost profytable / And how Ihū doth al that is weldone in his louers on̄ly for loue. And how lo¦ue makyth the vsynge of al vertues & all good dedes ly∣ght and easy / Caplm̄ xxxvi ASke thou then of god no thyng but this yeft of loue that is the holy ghost / For among al ye yef∣tes ye our lorde yeueth there is none so good ne so profy∣table.
so worthy ne so excellēt as this is / For there is no yefte of god that is bothe the yeuer and ye yefte but this yefte of loue / And therfore it is the best and the worthy est / The yefte of prophecye the yeftes of myracles wor∣chyng. the yefte of the grete knowyng and coūselynge. and the yefte of grete fastynge or of grete penaūce doin¦ge: or ony other suche are grete yeftes of the holy ghost. but they are not the holy ghost / For a reproued soule & a dampnable myghte haue al thise yeftes as hath a cho∣sē soule / And therfore al thise maner yeftes are not gret¦ly for to desyre ne moche for to charge / But the yefte of loue is the holy ghost god hymself. And hym may no sou¦le haue & be dāpned wyth al / For that yefte saueth it on̄¦ly fro dampnacyon. & makyth it goddis sone perceyuer of heuēly heritage / And that loue as I haue before sayd is not the affeccyon of loue that is formed in a soule: but it is the holy ghoste hymselfe that is loue vnfourmed yt saueth a sowle / For he yeueth hymself to a soule fyrst or the soule louith hym / and he fourmeth ye affeccyon in ye soule: & maketh the soule for to loue hym oonly for hym¦self / And not on̄ly that: but also bi this yefte the soule lo¦ueth itself & al his euencrystē as itself on̄ly for god / and this is the yefte of loue that makith shedinge atwyx cho¦sen soules & reproued / And this yefte makyth fully pees atwyxe god & a soule. and on̄ly al blessed creatures holy in god for it makyth Ihū for to loue vs & vs hym also / And euery eche of vs for to loue other in hym / Coueyte this yefte of loue pryncypally as I haue sayd / For yf he woll of his grace yeue it the on that maner wyse it shall open & lyghtē the reason of thy soule for to see sothfast∣nes yt is god & ghostly thynges / And it shal styre thyn af¦feccōn holy for to see sothfastnes yt is god & ghostly thin¦ges / And it shal styre thyn affeccion holy & fully for to loue
hym / & it shall worche in thy soule oonly as he wol. & thou shalt beholde Ihū reuerently with softnes of loue & see how he doth. Thus byddeth he by his prophete that we sholde do sayenge thus / Uacate et videte qm̄ ego sū¦deus / Cease ye & seeth ye I am god / That is. ye y• are refo¦urmed in felynge & haue your In̄er eye opened in to syʒt of ghostly thynges cease ye some tyme of outwarde wor¦chyng & see yt I am god / That is: See on̄ly how I Ihū god & man do / Beholde you me for I do al / I am loue: & for loue I do al yt I do: & ye do nought / And yt this is soo¦th I shall shewe you / For there is no gode dede doon by you: ne good thought felte in you: but yf it be done thru∣gh me / That is. Thrugh myght & wysdome. & loue my gholy. wyttely & louely / Elles it is noo good dede / But now is it soth y• I Ihū am bothe myght & wysdome and blessed loue & ye nought: for I am god / Then mowe ye wele that I do al your good dedes / And al gode though see: and al your good loues in you: and ye do ryght nou¦ght / And yet neuertheles ben al thyse good dedes called yours / Not for ye worthe hem pryncypally. but for I ye¦ue hē to you for loue that I haue to you / And therfore sy¦then I y• am Ihesu and for loue dooth al this. cease then ye of the beholdynge of yourselfe: and sette yourselfe at nought & loke on me. & see that I am god for I do al this This is somwhat of the meanyng of the verse of dauyd before sayd / See then & beholde what loue wercheth in a chosen soule that he refourmeth in felynge to his lyke¦nes whan ye reason slyghtned a lytyl to ye ghostly kno∣wynge of Ihū. and to ye felynge of his loue / Then bryn¦geth loue in to the soule the full hede of vertues. and tor∣neth hm al into softnes & in to lykynge as it were with out worchynge of the soule: for the soule stryueth not mo¦che for the getynge of hem as it dyde before. but it hathe
hem easely and felyth hem restfully oonly thorughe the yefte of loue that is the holy ghost / And that is a wel gre¦te comforte and gladnes vnspekable whan it felyth so∣denly and wote neuer how the vertue of mekenesse and pacyence soberte and sadnesse chastyte and clennes lo∣uered to hys euen crysten. and al other vertues the whi¦che wee to hym sōtyme traueylous paynful & harde for to kepe are now torned into softnes & lykyng and in to wonderful lyghtnes: so ferforthe that hym thynkith no maystrine no hardnes for to kepe euery vertue but it is most lykyng to hym for to kepe it: & al this makyth loue ¶Other men that stonden in the comoetee of charyte and arne not yet so ferforthe in grace. But worche vn∣der the byddynge of reason they stryuen and fyghten al daye ayenste synnes for the getynge of vertues: and so∣metyme they ben aboue and somtyme bynethe as wrast lees are / Thyse men done ful well / They haue vertues in reason and wyl. not in sauour ne in lone: for they fy∣ghten wyth hemselfe as it were by her owne myght for hem / And therfore may they not haue full rest ne fully the hyer honde / Neuerthelesse they shal haue moche me¦de: but they are not yet mke ynough / They haue not yet putte hemselfe al fully in goddys honde: for they see him not yet / But a soule that hath ghostly sighte of Ihe¦su takethe noo grete kepe of stryuynge for vertues for that tyme / He is not besy abowte hem specially but he setteth all his besynesse for to kepe that syghte and that beholdyng of Ihesu that it hath for to holde the mynde stably therto / And bynde the loue oonly to it that it fall not therfro: and forgete all other thynges asmoche as it maye / And whanne it dooth thus thenne is Ihesu soth∣fastly mayster ayen all synnes / And bishado wyth it wyth hys blessed presence and getyth it all vertues /
And the soule is so comforted & so borne vp with the sof¦te felynge of loue that it hath of the syghte of Ihū that it feleth noo grete dysease outwarde / And thus sleeth loue generally alsynnes in a soule: & reformeth it in the newe felynges of vertues / ¶How loue thrugh gracyous beholdyng of Ihū sleeth al styrynges of pryde: & maketh y• soule for to lese sauour & delyte in al erthly worshyp / Caplm̄ xxxvii. NEuertheles how loue sleeth synnes & refourme: th vertues in a soule more specyally shal I saye & fyrst of pryde & of meknes that it contrary vertue ther¦to / Thou shalt vnderstonde that there is two maner of mekenes / One is had by worchyng of reason / Another is felte of the specyal yeft of loue / Bothe are of loue. but that one loue worcheth by reason of the soule. but that o¦ther he worcheth by hymself / The fyrst is vnperfyte. ye other is perfyte / The fyrste mekenes that a man feleth of beholdyng of his owne synnes and of his owne wret∣chidnes thrugh the whiche beholdyng he thynketh hym selfe vnworthy for to haue ony yefte of grace or ony me¦de of god. But hym thynketh it ynoughe that he wolde of his grete mercy graunt hym foryeuenesse of his syn∣nes / And also he thynketh hym by cause of his owne sin¦nes that he is worse than the moste synner that lyueth / and that euery man doth better than he / and so by suche beholdynge thresteth he hymselfe downe in his though¦te vnder al men / And he is besy for to ayenstonde the sty¦rynge of pryde asmoche as he maye bothe bodyly pryde & ghostly. and dyspiseth hymself so that he assenteth not to the felynges of pryde / And yf his herte be taken som∣tyme with it that it be deoyled with vayne Ioye of wor¦shyp or of cunnyng or of praysyng or of ony other thyn∣ge / as sone as he maye perceyue it he is euyl payd wyth
hymself & hath sorowe for it in hert & asketh foryeuenes of it of god. & she wyth hym to his confessour. & accuseth hymself mekely. & receyueth his penaūce / This is good meknes. but it is not yet perfyte mekenes for it is of sou¦les y• are begynnynge & profytyng in grace caused of be¦holdynge of synnes / Loue worchyth this meknes by re¦ason of the soule / Perfyte mekenes a soule feleth of ye sy¦ghte & the ghostly knowyng of Ihū / For whan the holy ghost lyghtneth the reason in to the syght of soth fastnes how Ihū is al & that he doth al / the soule hath so grete lo¦ue & so grete Ioye in that ghostly syght / for it is so soth fa¦ste that it foryeteth itself. & fully leneth to Ihū with all ye loue that it hath for to beholde hym / It takith no kepe of no vnworthynes of itselfe ne of synnes afore done / but setteth at nought itself with al the synnes & al ye gode de∣des that euer it dyde. as yf there were no thyng but Ihū Thus meke dauyd was whan he sayd thus / Et sebstā∣cia mea tanqm̄ nichilū an̄ te / That is:P.C xxxviii Lorde Ihesu the syght of thy blessed vnmade substance & thyn endles be¦ynge sheweth wel vnto me that my substaunce & beyng of my soule is as nought anence y• / Also anence his euē crysten he hath no rewarde to hem ne demynge of hem whether they ben better or worse than hymselfe is / For he holde hymself & al other men as it were euen ylike no¦ught of hēself anence god. & that is soth. For al the good¦nes y• is done in hamselef or in hē is on̄ly of god whō he beholdeth as al / And therfore setteth he al other creatu∣res at nought as he doth hymself:Isay.  Thus meke was the prophete whan he sayd thus / Om̄es gentes quasi non sintsic sunt coram eo et quasi nichilū & mane reputate sunt e / Al men are before our lorde as nought. & as vu∣notefull and noughte they are a counted to hym / That is anentes the endeles beynge aud the vnchaungable
kynde of god mankynde is as noughte / For of nou∣ghte ade and to noughte sholde it torne but yf he kepe it in the beynge that made it of noughte / Thys is sothfastnesse and this sholde make a soule meke yf it myght see thorughe grace this sothfastnesse / Therfore whan loue openeth the Inner eye of the soule for to see this sothfastnesse wyth other cyrcumstaunces that co∣men wyth al thenne begynneth the soule for to be soth∣fastly meke / For thenne by the syghte of god it felyth & seeth itselfe as it is / And thenne forsakyth the soule the beholdynge and the lenynge to itself: and fully fallith to the beholdinge of Ihesu / And whan it dooth soo. then∣ne settyth the soule noughte by al the Ioye and the wor∣shyp of the worlde / For the Ioye of worldly worshyp is so lytyl and so nought in rewarde of that Ioye and that lone that it felith in the ghostly syghte of Ihesu and kno¦wynge of sothfastnes. that though it myghte haue it wi¦thout ony synne he wolde noughte of it / Ne though mē wolde worshyppe hym prayse hym and fauour hym. or set hym att grette state it lykyth hym noughte / Ne thou¦gh he had cunnynge of al the vii. artes of clergye and of all craftes vnder the sonne: or had power for to werke al manere myracles. he hathe no more deynte of al this ne: more sauour of hem than to gnawe on a drye stycke He had wel leuer forgete al this and for to be al one out of the sight of the worlde than for to thynke on hem and be worshypped of al men / For the herte of a true louer of Ihesu is made somoche and soo large thrugh a lytyl syght of hym and a lytyl felynge of his ghostly loue that al the lykynge and al the Ioye of al erth maye not suffy∣ce for to fyll a corner of it / And thenne semyth it well that tbyse wretched worldly louers that arne as it were rauysshed in loue of her owne worsyhppe / And pourse
we after it for to haue it wyth al the myghte and all the wytte they that haue / they haue noo sauour in this mek¦nes / they are wōder ferre therfro. But the  of Ihe¦su hath this mekenes lastyngly. And that not wyth he∣uynes and striuynge for it / but wyth likynge and glad¦nes. The whiche gladnesse it hath not. for it forsakyth the worshyp of the worlde / for that were a prowde me∣kenes that longeth to an ypocryte / but for he hath a sy∣ghte and a ghostly knowynge of sothfastnesse and wor∣thynes of Ihesu thrugh the yefte of the holy ghoste / That reuerente syght and that louely beholdyng of Ihe¦su comforteth the loue soo wōderfully and bereth it vp so myghtyly and so softly sothly that it maye not lyke ne fully rest in none erthly Ioye. ne it wol not / He makith none force whether men lacke hym or prayse hym / wor¦shyp hym or dispyse him as for hymselfe / He settyth it not at herte neyther for to be well payd yf men dyspyse hym as for more mekenes. Ne for to be euell payd that men sholde worshyp hym or payse hym / He hadde leuer for to foryete both that one and that other: And oonly thynke on Ihesu and gete mekenes by that waye / And that is moche the lykerer waye who myght come ther∣to / Thus dyde dauid whan he sayd / P. xiiii O cul mei semper ad dn̄ quoniam ipse euelle de laqueo pedes meos / That is / Myn eyen are euer open to Ihesu our lorde for why: he shal plucke my fete fro snares of sinnes / For whan he dooth so thenne forsakyth he vtterly hymself & vndercastyth hym holy to Ihesu / & then is he in a syker warde for the sheelde of sothfastnes the whyche he holde¦th kepeth hym so wel that he shal not be hurte thorughe noo styrynge of pryde as longe as he holdeth hym with∣in the sheelde as the prophete sayth / Scuto circunda∣bit te verytas eius nō cebis a timore nocuruo.P. x. Soch
fastnes shal vmbyclyppe the with a sheelde. & that is yf thou al other thynges left oonly beholde hym / For theu shal thou not drede for the nyghtes drede. That is: thon shalt not drede the spyryte of pryde whether he come by nyghte or by daye as the nexte verse sayth after thus / A sagitta volante in die / P. x. Pryde comyth by nyght for to as¦sayle a soule whan it is dispysed and repreued of other men that it sholde by that fall in heuynes & in to sorowe It comyth also as an arowe fleinge on the day whan a man is worshypped & praysed of al men. whether it be for worldly dooynge or for ghostly that he sholde haue vayne Ioye in hymselfe restyngly. and fals gladnesse in a passinge thynge / This is a sharpe arowe and a paryl¦lous / It fleeth swyftly. & it stryketh softly. but it woūde¦th dedely / But the louer of Ihū that stabli beholdeth bi deuoute prayers & besy thynkynge on hym is so vmby∣lapped wyth the syker sheelde of sothfastnes that he dre¦deth not: for this arrowe maye not entre in to the soule / Ne though it come it hurteth not: but glenteth a waye & passeth forthe / And thus is the soule made meke as I vnderstonde by the worchynge of the holy ghost that is ye gyfte of loue / For he openeth the eye of the soule for to see and loue Ihesu / And he kepyth the soule in that sy∣ght restfully & sykerly / And helleeth al the styrynges of pryde wōderfully and pryuely and softly: and the soule wote neuer how / And also he bryngeth in by that waye sothfastly and onely the vertue of mekenesse / All this dooth loue. but not in al his louers ylyke ful / For some hath this grace but shortly and lytyl as it were in the be¦gynnynge of it. & a lytyl assayenge towarde for the con¦scyence is not yet clēsed fully thrugh grace / & som̄ haue it more fully. for they haue clerer syght of Ihesu. & they fele more of his loue / And some hath it moost fully. for
they haue the ful yefte of contemplocyon / Neuertheles he that leest hath on this maner I haue sayd. I hope so thly he hath the yeft of perfyte mekenes. for he hath the yeft of perfyte loue / ¶ How loue sleeth al styrynges of wrathe & enuye soft∣ly & refourmeth in the soule the vertues of pees & pac∣ce & of perfyte charyte to his euen crysten as he dyde spe¦cyally in the appostles. Caplm̄ xxxviii LOue worcheth wysely & softly in a soule there he wol for he sleeth myghtyly yre & enuye and al passyons of angrynes & malencoly in it. and bryngeth in to the soule vertues of pacyence & myldenes peasybi¦lyte and louered to his euencrysten / It is ful harde & a grete maystry to a man that stondeth oonly in worchyn∣ge of his owne reason for to kepe pacyence holy reest & softnes in herte & charyte to his euen crysten if they dy∣sease hym vnskylfully and done hym wrong that he ne shal somwhat do ayen to hem thorugh styrynge of yre or of malencolye eyther in spekynge or in worchyng or bothe / And neuertheles though a man be styred & trow¦bled u hymself and made vnrestful. be so that it be not to moch passynge ouer the bondes of reason. and that he kepe his honde & his tonge and be redy for to foryeue the trespase whan mercy is asked / yet this man hath ye vertue of pacyence though it be but weyke & nakydly. for as moche as he wolde haue it and traueyleth besyly in refreynynge of his vnskylful passyons that he myʒt hane it / and also is sory that he hath it not as he sholde / But to a true louer of Ihesu it is noo grete maystry for to suffre al his / For why loue fyghteth for hym & sleeth wonder softly suche styrynges of wrathe & of malenco∣ly. and makyth his soule so easely and so peasyble so suf∣ferynge and so goodly thorugh the ghostly syght of Ihū

dide hym harme / And sothly better loueth hym and mo¦re feruently desyreth the saluacion of his soule. by cau∣se that he seeth that he shall haue so moche ghostly profy¦te of the euyl dede of that other man though it be ayenst his wyl / But this loue and this mekenes worcheth on̄¦ly the holy ghoste aboue the kynde of man in hem that he maketh the true louers of Ihesu / ¶How loue sleeth couetyse lechyry and glotenye / and sleeth that flesshly sauour and delyte in al the v. bodyly wyttes softly and easely thrugh a gracyous beholdyng of Ihesu / Capitulum xxxix COuetise also is slayne in a sowle by the worchin¦ge of loue: for it makyth the soule soo coueytous of ghostly gode and to heuenly ryches soo ardaunt that it setteth ryght nought by al erthly thynges / It hathe noo more deynte in hauyng of a precyous stone thanne a chalke stone / ne more loue hath he in a hundreth poū¦de of golde thanne in a pounde of leed / It setteth al thin¦ge that shal perysshe at one pryce / No more he chargeth that one than that other as in his loue / For it semyth wel that al thyse erthly thynges that worldly men lete so grete pryce of & loue soo deyntly sholde passe awaye & torne to nought both the thynge in itself and the loue of it / And therfore he bryngeth it in his thoughte by tyme in to that plyghte that it shal be after. and so acounteth it as nought / And whan worldly louers stryuen & fygh¦ten. and plede for erthly good who maye fyrste haue it / the louer of Ihesu stryueth wyth noo man but kepyth hymselfe in pees. and holdeth hym payd with that yt he hath and wol stryue for no more / For hym thynkyth yt he nedeh no more of al the ryches in erthe than a skant bodyly sustenaunce for to saue the bodyly lyf withal as longe as god wol. and that he maye lyghtly haue / And
therfore woll he no more than skantly hym nedeth for the tyme that he maye frely be dyscharged fro besynes aboute the kepynge and the dispendyng of it. And fully yeue his herte & his sesynes aboute the sekynge of Ihesu for to fynde hym in clen̄es of spiryte: for that is al his co¦uetyse / For why: oonly clene of herte shall see hym / Also flesshly loue of fader and moder and other world¦ly frendes hangeth not vpon hym / It is euen kutte fro his herte with the swerde of ghostly loue that he hath no more affeccion to fader or moder or to ony worldly frē∣de than he hath to a nother man. But yf he see or fele in hem more grace or more vertue than in other men / Ou¦te take this: That his fader and his moder had the selfe grace that some other men haue / But neuertheles yf they ben not soo: thenne loueth he other men better thā hem. that is charyte / And soo sleeth goddis loue couety¦se of the worlde. and bringeth in to the soule pouerte in spyryte / And that dooth loue not oonly in hem that ha∣ue right noughte or worldly gode but also in some crea¦tures that are in grete worldly state and haue dispēdin¦ge or erthly ryches / Loue sleeth in some of hem couety¦se so ferforth that they haue more lykynge ne sauour in hauynge of hem than of a strawe / Ne though they be lost for defawte of hem that sholde kepe hem they sette noughte therby / For why the herte of goddis louer is thrugh the yefte of the holy ghost taken so fully wyth ye syghte of the loue of a nother thynge that is Ihesu. and that is soo precyous and so worthy that it woll receyue none other loue restyngly that s contrary therto / And not on̄ly doth loue this but also it sleeth the lykyng of le¦chery & al other bodily vnclennes And bryngeth in to ye soule very chastyre. & torneth it in to likynge / For the soule felyth so grete delyte in the syghte of Ihū that it ly¦kyth
for to be chaste & is no grete hardnes to it for to ke∣pe chastyte. for it is so moost ease & moste rest / And vpō the selfe wyse the yefte of loue sleeth lustes of glotenye & makyth ye soule sobre & temperaunt and bereth it vp so myghtily that it maye not rest in lykynge of mete & dryn¦ke. but it taketh mete & drynke what it be that leest greue¦th the bodyly cōplexyon yf he maye lyghtly come therto Not for loue of itself. but for ye loe of god / On this ma¦ner wyse ye louer of god seeth wel yt hym nedeth for to ke¦pe his bodyly lyf with mete & drynke aslōge as god wol suffre hm to be togyder / Then shal this be ye dyscrecōn of the louer of Ihū as I vnderstōde y• hath felyng & wor∣chynge in the loue. yt vpon what maner yt he maye most kepe his grace hol and leest be letted fro worchyng in it thorugh takynge of bodyly sustenaunce. so shal he do / That maner of mefe ye leest letteth & lest troubleth ye her¦te and maye kepe the body in strengthe be it flesshe be it fysshe be it brede & ale: yt I trowe the soule cheseth for to haue yf it maye come therby / For al the besynes of the soule is for to thinke on Ihū with reuerent loue euer wi¦thout ettynge of ony thynge yf yt it myght / And therfo¦re sythen it must nedes sōwhat be letted & hyndred. the lesse yt it is letted & hyndred by mete or drynke or ony oth¦er thynge the leur it is / It had leuer vse the beste mete & moste of pryce vnder the son̄e yf it lesse letted the kepyn¦ge of his herte than for to take but brede & water yf yt let¦ted hym more / For he hath no rewarde for to gete hym grete mede for the payne of fastynge. & be put ther by fro softnes in herte: but al his besynes is for to kepe his hert as stably as he maye in the syght of Ihū & in the felynge o his loue / And sothly as I trowe he might with lesse ly¦kynge vse ye beste mete yt is gode in the owne kynde than a nother man yt worcheth al in reason without the specy¦al
yeft of loue sholde mowse ye worst. out take mete that thrugh crafte of cury osyte is on̄ly made for luste / That maner of mete may he not wel acorde with al / And also on that other syde yf lytyl mete as on̄ly brede & ale most helpeth & easeth his herte and kepyth it moost in pees it is most leyf than to hym for to vse it so. & namly yf he fe¦le bodyly strengthe only of the yefte of loue withal / And yet doth loue more for it sleeth accidye & flesshly ydlenes and makyth the soule to be occupyed in goodnes & nam¦ly Inwarde in beholdyng of hym. by the vertue of whi¦che the soule hath sauour & ghostly delyte in prayenge in thynkynge & in al other maner of doyng that nedeth for to be done after the state that he is in withoute heuynes or paynful bytternes whether he be relygious or seculer Also it sleeth the vayne lykyng of the v. bodyly wyttes / For the syght yf the eye: that the soule hath no lykyng in the syghte of ony worldly thing. but it feleth rather pey¦ne and dysease in beholdynge of it be it neuer soo fayre. neuer soo precyous neuer soo wonderful / And therfore as worldely louers renne oute some tyme for to se newe thynges for to wonder on hem: And soo for to fede her hertis wyth the vayne syghte of hem / Ryghte so a louer of Ihesu is besye for to renne awaye & withdrawe hym fro the syghte of suche maner thynges that the Inner syghte be not letted / For he seeth ghostly a nother maner thynge that is fayrer and more wōderful and that wol¦de he not forbere / Ryght on the selfe wyse is it of spekyn¦ge & heryng It is a peyne to ye soule of a louer of Ihū for to speke or here ony thing yt myght let the fredō of his ha¦rte for to thynke on Ihū. what sōge or melody or mynst ralsye outwarde yt yt be yf it let the thought yt it may not freely / And rest fully pray or thynke on hym / It lykyth hym ryght nought / & the more delectable yt it is to other

wordes of loue in eeres of the herte / Oonly is a soule whan it loueth Ihesu and tentyth fully to him and hath loste the sauour and the conforte of the worlde And that it myghte better kepe this oonlynes it fleeth ye companye of all men yf it maye. And sechyth oonlynes of body: for that moche helpeth to oonlynes of the soule and to the free worchynge of loue / The lesse lettynge yt it hath wythout of vayne Ianglyng or wythin of vayn thynkynge the more free it is in ghostly beholdynge. & so it is in pryuyte of herte / Al wythout is a soule whiles it is ouerlayed and blynded with worldly loue / It is as comen as the hye waye for euery stirynge that cometh of the flesshe or of ye fende synketh in and gooth thorugh it / But thenne thrugh grace it is drawen in to the pre∣uy chambre in to the syghte of oure lorde Ihesu. and he¦reth his preuy counseyle.

And neuertheles our lorde makyth straunge & comyth not crye I neuer so fast / For he is syker ynough of his lo¦uer yt he wol not torne ayen to worldly loue fully he may no sauour haue therin. & therfore abydeth he the lenger But at the last whan he wol he comyth ayen ful of gra¦ce & of sothfastnes. & vysyteth the soule ye languyssheth in desyre by syghynges of loue to his presence. & to wchy¦th it & anoynteth it ful softly with the oyle of gladnes. & makyth it sodeynly hole fro al pyne: and then cryeth the soule to Ihesu in ghostly voys with a glad herte thus / Oleum effusum nomen tuum / Oyle yshedde is thy na¦me / Thy name is Ihesu.Cant. i that is hele / Then aslonge as I fele my soule sore & syke for synne pyned with ye heuy burden of my body sory and dredynge for perylles and wretchydnes of this lyfe. so longe lorde Ihū thy name is oyle speryd not oyleshed to me / But whā I fele my sou¦e sodeynly towched with the lyght of thy grace heled & softed fro all the fylthe of synne. & comforted in loue & in lyght with ghostly strength & gladnes vnspekable. then maye I saye with lusty louynge & ghostly myghte to the Oyle yshed is thy name Ihū to me / For by the affecte of thy grayous vysytynge I fele wel of thy name the true expownynge y• thou art Ihū heele.

al meanes are broken awaye of corrupcyon & of syn̄e be¦twyx Ihū & his soule fully ooned to hym with softnes of loue / But this is on̄ly grace aboue mannys kynde / He is ful blynde yt feyneth hym in grace without ghost¦ly felynge of goddys Inspyracyon. & setteth hymself in a maner of stablynes as he were euer in felyng & in wor¦chynge of specyal grace: demyng that al is grace that he dooth & felyth without & within. thynkynge that what so euer he do or speke is grace: holdyng hymself vnchaū¦gable in specyallyte of grace. If there be ony suche as I hope there be none: he is ful blynde in felynge of grace / Bu then myght thou saye thus that we sholde loue on̄¦ly in trouthe.Heb. x. & not coueyte ghostly felynges ne rewarde hem yf they come / For the apostle sayth / Iust{us} ex fide vi¦uit / That is: The ryghtwysman lyueth in trouthe. Un¦to this I say y• bodyly felynges ben they neuer so comfor¦table we shal not coueyte ne rewarde moche yf they co∣me / But ghostly felynges suche as I spake of yf they co¦me in the maner as I haue sayd before we sholde euer de¦syre: yt are sleenge of al worldly loue openyng of y• ghost¦ly eye: puryte of spiite: pees of cōscience: & al other befo¦re sayd / We sholde coueyte to fele euer the lyfly Inspyra¦cyon of grace made by ye ghostly presence of Ihū in our soule yf yt we myght. & for to haue hym in our syght with reuerēce. and euer fele ye swetnes of his loue by a wōder¦ful homlynes of his presence / This sholde be our lyfe & our feling in grace after ye mesure of his yefte in whom al grace is. to some more & to some lesse / For his presen∣ce is feled in dyuers manere wyse as he wouchith saaf / And in this we sholde lyue & worche that longeth to vs to worche. for wythout this we shold not cunne lyue / For ryghte as the soule is the lyfe of the body. ryghte soo is Ihesu the lyfe of the soule by his gracyous presence /

The werke is good and gracyous in itselfe / And though it be not al fully contemplacyon. in itselfe ne the werkyng of loue by itselfe / Neuerthelesse it is a parte of contemplacyon / For why: It maye not be doone on
this maner wyse but in plentee of grace thrugh openin¦ge of the ghostly eye / And therfore a soule that hath this fredom and thys gracyous felynge in prayenge wyth ghostly sauour and heuenly delyte hath the grace of con¦templacyon in maner as it is / This prayer is a ryche offynge fylled al in fatnes of deuocion: receyued by an¦gels and presented to the face of Ihesu / The prayer of other men that are besy in actyf werkes is made of two wordes. For they oft tymes fourmeth in her hertes one worde thrugh thynkyng of worldly besynes. & sownen in her mouth a nother worde of ye psalme songe or sayd / And not for that. yf her entente be true yet is her prayer good & medeful though it lacke sauoure & swetnes / But this manere of a man cōtemplatyfe is made but of one worde. for as it is fourmed in ye herte righte soo hooly it sowneth in the mouth. as it were noughte but one thyn¦ge that fourmyth & sowneth / And sothly nomore it is / For the soule thrugh grace is made hole in itselfe so fer¦re departee fro the flesshlyhede that it is mayster of the body. and thn̄e is the body noughte elles but as an In∣strumente & a trōpe of the soule in the whyche the soule blowith swete notes of ghostly louynges to Ihū / This is the trompe that Dauyd spoke of thus / P. lxxx Buccinate in neomenia tuba in insigni die solēpnitatis vestre / Blo¦we ye wyth a trompe in the newe mone / That is ye sou¦les that are refourmed in ghostly lyft thrugh openynge of the Inner eye.

For it seeth sothfastnes of holy wrytte wonderly shewed and opened aboue studye and traueyle & reason of man¦nes kyndly wyt / And that maye wel be called the felyn∣ge and the perceyuynge of Ihesu / For Ihesu is welle of wysdome. and by a lytyl heeldynge of his wysdom in to a clene soule he maketh the soule wyse ynough for to vn¦derstonde al holy wrytte. not al at ones in specyal behol¦dynge: but thorugh that grace the soule receyueth a ne∣we ablynes and a gracyous habyte for to vnderstonde it specyally whan it comyth to mynde.

If a man loue an other mā whiche is absent: he desyreth gretly his pre¦sence. Ryght so ghostly as longe as we are in this lyf our lor¦de is absent fro vs yt we may neyther se hym ne here hym ne fele hym as he is: & therfore we maye not haue ye vse of thys ful loue here in ful lykyng. but we may haue a desyre & a gre¦te yernyng for to be present to hym for to se hym in his blysse & fully for to be oned to hym in loue: this desyre may we haue of his yefte in this lyf. by the whiche we shall be safe. for it is loue vnto hym as it may be had here. thus saynt poul sayth ¶Scientes qm̄ dū sumus ī hoc corpore pegrinamur a dn̄o per fide menim ambulamus & non pec sp̄em. audemus & bonam voluntatem hēmus magis peregrinari a corpore & presences ēe ad deū. & iō contendimus siue absentes siue pre¦sentes placere illi / Saynt poul sayth that as long as we are in this body. we are pylgrymes fro our lorde yt is we are ab∣sent fro heuen in this excile we goo by trouth not by syght. yt
