The Lovers Fancy. Or True Love requited with Constancy: Being a Civil Discourse between John and Anne. The Young man he was constant unto the end, The Maid at last she prov'd his loving friend: Yung Men and Maids that stand to hear this Song, Ten mid it well, do not each other wrong: Young Men, prove constant, faithful, true and just, And then the Maids may better to you trust. To the tune of Loves Fancy. a man and a woman holdig hands AS lately abroad I was walking, it was in the prime of the spring, I spied two Lovers were talking the birds they did swéetly sing: A listned a while unto them to hear what these Lovers did say: The young man he kindly woo'd her and call'd her his Love and his joy, And often he said sweet Nancy I love thee as dear as my life And constant i'le prove unto thee if thou wilt but be my wife. The young man was handsome & pretty the maid she was wondrous fair There is not two more in the City I think, that can with them compare, Then listen a while you Lovers to what in my Ditty is pen'd, And see that you prove as constant and faithful unto the end: And he began to woo her to tell her some part of his mind And often he said unto her I prethee sweet Nancy be kind. Come hither my amorous Girl, I prethee come sit down by me; I love thee far better than Pearl, if that we two can but agrée: Long time I have truly lov'd thée, but never till now could I find A place that was more convenient to tell thée some part of my mind: Then prethee sit down, swéet Nancy, I love thee as dear as my life, And constan i'le prove unto thee, if thou wilt but be my wife. Maid. O sir! you have been a stranger, I have not seen you a great while, What fortune had I for to meet thee thou makest my worship to smile: Surely you do come for to wooe me your tongue it so nimbly doth run, But if that you should dissemble, then surely I were undone For young men will cog & dissemble also they will flatter & lie And speak much in praise of maids beauty only their humors to try.
Man. TO spak Love in praise of thy Beauty it is but a needlesse thing For it is for pure love that I woo thee and Love it will conquer a King: Brave Lords they submit unto it and Ladies are forc'd to obey. Then pt, e love, prove not cruel nor cast not a man away Then prethee sit down sweet Nancy I love thee as dear as my life, And constant i'le prove unto thee if thou wilt but be my wife. Maid. To tell me of love is but folly for which I do plainly see When as a young couple are married and fall into Poverty; Then Love it is quickly fding nay true love it falls to decay, Then prethee do not dissemble nor seek a maid to betray: For my mother hath often told me, and sometimes hath beten me And swears she will never abide me if that I should marry with thee. Man. I fear not thy friends displeasure nor not if thy mother do frown For thou art my ciefest treasure of ll the maids in the town: I prie thee far better then Rubies or Pearl that is placed in Gold, Ty figt it doth so rejoyce me when as I thy person behold Then ethee sit down sweet Nancy I love thee as dear as my life and constant I will prove to thee if thou wilt but be my wife. Maid. You say you will prove constant and love me as dear as your life Also you do vow to be faithful if that I will but be thy wife: But what hast thou for to maintain me that's a thing to be consider'd on? Come tell me & do not dissemble or else prethee let me be gon. For young men will proffer great matters when as they a woing do go But when that they once are married, maids find it is nothing so. Man, To tell the of Lands or livings, I need not the same to repeat For truly love I have none for thee but what with my hands I must get Yet labour I will to maintain thee, and work till my fingers are sore: Then prethee love do not disdain me why canst thou desire more? Then turn to me Nancy & kisse me and grant me a loving reply, For if that thou prove cruel surely for love I shall dye. I scorn for to cog or to flatter, or promise thee more then I have Yet truly I'le do my endeavour love, all that I cn get for to save, Ile give it to thee my Hony to buy the what ere thou dost lack Provision to nourish thy body and cloaths to put on thy back: Then turn to me Nancy & kisse me and grant me a loving reply For if that thou provest cruel surely for love, &c Maid. You speak very honest and civi but yet I am loath for to yield; But many a sort-hearted Souldier is forc't for to give up the field, And if I should yield unto thee to marry thee and be thy wife, And that I should not live in quiet and peace all the days of my life, Then sure y heart would be broken; nay, Maidens would lugh and would say That there goes as harmless a Girl as ever Young man did betray. Man. No Woman that lives in the City shll live a more peaceable life, I'le do my endeavour to please thee too, if thou wilt but be my Wife: Thou ner'e shalt have cause to be angry with any thing that I do say, Then prethee, Love, prove not cruel, nor cast not a man away, Then turn to me, Nancy, and kiss me, I love thee as dear as my life, And constant I will prove to thee, if thou wilt but be my Wife. Maid. Well, séeing thou wilt prove constant, as faithful ile prove unto thee; Lets point a day then for certain when as our Wedding shall be: Then pethee, Love, cast away sorrow, to morrow shall be the day, On Thursday we mean to be married, on Fryday we mean for to play, On Saturday go to the Market, and on Sunday we'l go to the Church, And on Monday we'l fall to our labour to put the young Childen to Nurse. Man. And these two Lovers departed, and homeward they went with all spee Whereafter I hear of their Neighbou this couple they lovingly agreed: I wish them much joy together, a long and a peaceable life, That he prove a careful Husband, and she prove a loving Wife. Then all You that hear my Ditty, come buy it and hear it away, The price of it is but a penny, then take it home with You, I pray. London Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, and J. Clarke.
