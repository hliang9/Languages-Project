TO THE KINGS Most Excellent Majestie. THE HVMBLE RE∣MONSTRANCE AND RE∣NEWED PETITION OF the Commissioners of the Gene∣rall Assembly of the Kirk of Scot∣land, from their meeting at Edin∣burgh, the second day of June. 1643. EDINBURGH, Printed by ROBERT BRYSON. 1643.
To the Kings most excellent Majestie. The humble Remonstrance and renewed Peti∣tion of the Commssioners of the Generall Assembly of the Kirke of Scotland, from their meeting at Edinburgh the second day of June. 1643. AS the manifold and pressing necessitie of the dutie of our place and trust, did constrain us, in these distempered and dangerous times, in most humble manner, To direct our earnest suplication to your Majestie, for such remedies as we conceive to be most fit for us to propone, And being applyed by your Majesties own hand, might both for cure and pre∣vention prove most effectuall: So are we enforced by the same ne∣cessitie growing daily to the greatest extremity, In all humilitie and earnestnesse, To renew not only our prayers to God, but our Petitions to your Majestie. For Sions sake can we not hold our peace, and for Je∣rusalems sake we will not rest, untill the righteousnesse thereof go forth as brightnesse, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. But be∣cause in your Majesties answer to our former Petition we meet with a multitude of prejudices and exceptions against us and our humble desires, we will crave leave, first to remove these out of the way: Ac∣knowledging the full expression of them by your Majestie to be no small favour, and being confident, after we have expressed our selves in the truth and integritie of our hearts, both to give unto and to re∣ceive
from your Majestes Justice and goodnesse the greater satis∣faction. And first, although there be good reason for printing of Answers and Replies, the Petition being before printed, yet we acknowledge that your Majestie hath just cause to finde fault with that publishing of our Petition in print (which is mentioned in the introduction to your Majesties answer) And if it had been done by our command∣ment, counsell or knowledge, we had not onely given yaur Majestie just provocation, and fallen in an errour contrary to the nature of a Petition, and to the right disposition of Petitioners, but also had used means contrary to our own ends, in publishing a programe of our dif∣fidence of obtaining our desires, or in giving a publike testimonie that we were aiming at some other thing then what we professed to seek, And therefore we are so far from excusing that form of doing, that we judge our selves to be wronged thereby. Another fault much more intollerable is objected against us: The bitternesse and sharpnesse of some expressions which may be interpreted by your Majesties wel affected Subjects not to be so agreeable to that regard and reverence which is due to your Majesties person, and the matter it self to be reprochfull to the honour and constitution of that your Majesties King∣dome. Whether the matter of the Petition be reproachfull shall af∣terwards in the particulars appear: But for the expresions we have ex∣amined the whole Petition and can finde no word of that kinde. We rather did fear the censure of fauning and flattering words, which your Majestie may remember were sometime put upon our suppli∣cations. Our desire was to keep within the bounds of that liberty which beseemeth the Ministers of Christ, and if any word have escap∣ed us which we cannot see, it was contrary to our intention: for we know that we should neither speak evill of dignitie nor unreverently unto them. The like report hath been made to your Majestie of our preaching and prayers, but when the delators are tryed, they will be found either malicious against us for reproving their faults; Or ha∣ving no other way of insinuation, too officious to your Majestie, or to others whom they desire to please, or so blinded with self-love, that they think Preachers should speak like Parasites; or so undis∣cerning, that when we professe our desire to the Reformation of Re∣ligion in England and Ireland, we are fansied by them to preach or pray against the King and his Royall authority. We fear God, and
honour the King, And have learned not onely to put a difference be∣twixt God and the King, but also (against the old sophistication now revived) betwixt the pictures of the Emperour, and the images of the false gods, craftily insert into them, and know the way how to honour the King without such a mixture and confusion. Slownesse to beleeve an evill report, and the constructing of things doubtfull is one of your Majesties Royall praises, of which the faithfull Ministers of this Kirk desire, against slanders and suspitions to have the experience: which will prove profitable for your Majesties honour and obedience, and our peace and quietnesse. As the North-wind driveth away rain: So doth an angry countenance a back-biting tongue. Righteous lips are the delight of Kings: and they love him that speaketh right. Concerning the interposing of the Generall Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, and our intermedling by commission from them in the Kirk of England; We humbly intreat your Majesty, to consider of the reasons of this our doing. 1. Although the Kirks of one Nation be distant in place from the Kirks of another Nation, yet are they uni∣ted in the heart and spirit, and are generally but one body and Kirke, and must as Sisters of one Mother keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace: whence ariseth the communion of all Gods graces and blessings amongst the Kirks, that they may not only help, comfort and refresh: but advise, admonish, exhort, warne and reprove one an∣other, so farre as need requireth, and their Christian love and ability reacheth. Yet avoiding both ambition and confusion: there being a co-ordination between Kirks of diverse Nations, but no subordinati∣on: We have not presumed to passe the limits of this Christian com∣munion: having proceeded by way of charity, and in a ministeriall, or rather brotherly manner, not by authority or magisterially: by way of humble supplication to your Majesty, Declaration to the House of Parliament, and advice and exhortation to such of our brethren of the Ministery as were best known unto us: very far from usurpation or jurisdiction. 2. Our humble Petition to your Majesty, and our De∣claration to the Parliament, were nothing else, but a prosecution of the demand made by the Commissioners of this Kingdom, and a pres∣sing of the Answer given by your Majesty and the Parliament, in the last Treaty; which filled us with hope of what was then demanded, since followed by diverse Declarations, and now again desired. 3. The experience of the sufferings of this Kirk from the doctrine, forme of
worship and government of the Kirk of England, doth beget feares of the like hereafter, which maketh our petition to be unto us a necessary meane of selfe-preservation. 4. Our encouragements from your Majesties Letter to the generall Assembly, and the Declaration of the House of Parliament, desiring them to concurre in petitioning your Majesty for setling one confession of Faith, one directory of the publike worship, and one Catechisme in all the three Kingdomes, as a meane to advance the honour and service of God, enlarge the greatnesse, power, and glory of the King, confirme the peace, security, and prosperitie of all his good Subjects, make way to the reliefe and deliverance of the poor afflicted Kirks abroad, and to the totall abolishing of the usurpation and tyrannie of Rome. 5. The paterne we have of this Christian duty both by word and writing in the Kirk at Jerusalem, and the Kirk at Antioch, which was first Crowned with the name of Christians, The one of which were Jewes, and the other Gentiles; And in diverse other Kirks recorded in Scripture, many Precedents also in antiquity before the Kirks did contend for primacie, or knew any preheminence one over another. Many examples of other reformed Kirks; And the practise of the Kirk of Scotland diverse times after the Reformation writing into England against the ceremonies, and for union against the Papists and their confederats banded together by the bloudy league of Trent. These and the like reasons we conceive did sufficiently authorize us in all that we have done, not as Directors or Judges, but as supplicants and humble advisers. In that day shall there be an high way out of Egypt into Assyria (from one Kirk and Nation of the Gentiles to another) And the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians, whom the Lord of Hostes shall blesse. Upon this and the like grounds, have letters been sent professedly, between some godly, loyall and peaceable Ministers of the Kirk of England, and the Generall Assembly here, and their Commissioners: One of the meanes intended for the good of Religion in both King∣doms against Sects and Shismes, admitted and approven by your Ma∣jesties Commissioners in the Generall Assembly, and which for the forme of doing is innocent, and may be profitable, unlesse the matter be nocent and hurtfull, and thereby deserves censure. Wee wish wee were able by our Letters, Declarations, or Petitions; To reduce all the Reformed Kirks to a perfect conformity, to suppresse all the He∣resie, Superstition and Tyranny of Papists, and the Paganisme of
Turkes and infidels, and would not doubt of your Majesties Royall approbation notwithstanding all the Lawes standing to the contrary, and plea's could be made for their antiquity, happinesse and stability; Common arguments and colours pretended for every Religion, and of late answered to the full in the point of Episcopall government, from the verity of Scripture which is true antiquity, and the onely solide ground of the happinesse and stabilitie of Religion and govern∣ment of the Kirk. The Petitioners were far from laying upon your Majestie any im∣putation of the Irish Rebellion beseeching God to mainifest your Sacred Majesties innocencie to all the world. They made mention of the miseries of Ireland, for no other end, but to represent the dan∣ger of your Majesties Kingdoms through the prevailing power of the Popish faction; The British Papists at this time being animated by the same spirit, working upon the same principles, enraged with the same furies, breathing out the same threatnings and slaughter, aiming at the same ends, and emboldened with the same presumption, with the Papists of Ireland, their confederates. And withall to present our earnest desires for a pacification, that both the armies may be sent against that horride rebellion, and peace restored to all your Ma∣jesties Dominions. The expression in our Petition of Unitie in Religion, we have bor∣rowed from the Article in the Treatie accorded unto by your Maje∣stie, from the Declarations of the Parliament; and from the Gene∣rall Assembly: By which is meaned no other thing but one Confession of Faith one common directorie for worship, and one Catechisme. The Papists may know that the true Kirk in all ages, hath been trou∣bled with differences and contentions, as great as any now, against the Reformed Kirks, which many of the godly have lamented & studied to compose, and (as it was written of some heretikes of old) They them∣selves sacrifice in schisme and dissention, and greet the world with the name of peace, whom they drive from the peace of ther salvation. They therefore cannot hence authrize their scandal against the remformati∣on: yet the smallest differences of practise and diversitie of the expres∣sions, are matter of strife to the contentious, of hinderance of edifica∣tion to the ignorant, of stumbling to the weak, and of grief to the godly, when thereby they see against religious Unitie and Christian love, the bowels of the Kirk rent asunder, and people scandalously di∣vided
in some parts of the worship of God: All which evill, might be perfectly cured in all your Majesties dominions, the mouthes of Pa∣pists stopped, Schisme and Separation hereafter prevented, and the face of the Kirk filled with true beauty and splendor, to your Majesties greater glory, and the greater terrour of all your enemies: by this bles∣sed and never enough desired Unity in Religion: Without which ten∣der consciences being freed from constraint may be in some degree eased by your Majestie, but shall never have rest, and be satisfied, nor shall the rent of the Kirk arising from different or contrary practises be cured, but shall from time to time increase. Concerning uniformity in Kirk government, our hopes thereof and of the unity of Religion grounded upon the the Article of the Treatie, made this Kirk and Kingdom to enter into the more strict amity and friendship with England. And that the amitie and friend∣ship builded upon such a foundation might be the more firme and du∣rable, they have since pressed the same by their Petitions and De∣clarations, in all humilitie and love, without any bitternesse of expres∣sion: Onely they have declared the government of the Kirk by As∣semblies in their strong and beautifull order, and subordination to be by Divine right, and that as Prelacie is confessed in this your Maje∣sties Answer to be the rule of humane policie, so to be almost univer∣sally acknowledged by the Prelates themselves, and their adherents to be but a humane institution, intoduced by humane reason, and setled by humane Law and Custome, for supposed convenien∣cie; which therefore by humane authoritie, without wrong∣ing any mans conscience, may be altered and abolished up∣on so great a necessity, as is, a hearty conjunction of all the reform∣ed Kirks, a firm and well grounded peace, between the two Kingdoms, formerly divided in themselves and betwixt themselves by this parti∣tion wall, and a perfect Union of the two Kirks in the two Nations; which although by the providence of God in one Island, and under one Monarch, yet ever since the Reformation, have been at greater diffe∣rence in the point of Kirk government (which in all places hath a powerfull influence upon all the parts of Religon) then any other re∣formed Kirks, although in Nations at greatest distance, and under d∣vers Princes. Papacie is the greatest cause of schisme in the Christi∣an Kirk, and Episcopacie devised by man, to be a cure, the greatest cause of schisme in the Reformed Kirks.
As the mutuall relation and conjunction of true Ecclesiasticall and Civill government is a corroboration of both, so do we conceive that both are much weakened in their proper functions by that in∣termixture of the Ecclesiasticall government with the Civill State. And as we know the principles of Prelacy to be Popish, and contrary to the principles of Reformation: So have we reason to beleeve, that such an intermixture is not for your Majesties honour, while they maintain and professe that Monarchie cannot subsist without Prela∣cie: And that Prelacie had not been cast out of the Parliament, if it had been profitable there; And thought fit to be altogether abo∣lished, if it had not been an unprofitable burthen to the kingdom, and pernicious to the civill State and Common wealth: As is contained more fully in the Declaration of both Houses of Parliament to the Generall Assembly. The following of humane inventions, without and against Scripture, and the ambition and covetousnesse of Kirkmen, were observed of old, to be the corruptions which made many to call upon the Pope, and the chief guides of the Kirk, at that time for a Reformation: but all in vain, for that had been their own ruine, to which in humane reason, they would never willingly have consented. That upon the same causes and corruptions there is a necessity of reformation of the Kirk of England, Is as unanimously confessed, as it is universally acknowledged, that it is unlikely if not impossible; to be obtained in the regular and ordina∣ry way: Upon the reason exprest afterward in your Majesties answer. Because in the common and ordinary way the passion or interest of particular men will impose upon the publict: For what greater private interest then benefits and dignities? Who more interessed in these then Bishops, Deans, Arch-deacons and such ordinary members of the Convoca∣tion? And who can be more sueyed, and byassed with passion, then such as have this interest? Whether this be appliable to the Parlia∣ment, whose places and dignities are uncontroverted, and unquestio∣nable, it is not for us to judge: but this we know, when the corruptions of the Kirk are grown to such an height, that she can neither bear her diseases, nor endure the remedies, it is the dutie of the Magistrate and civill authoritie, by the advice of the more sound, and sincere part of the Kirk and Ministerie, to endevour a Reformation, since no Refor∣mation, worthie of that name, can be expected from the corrupt Cler∣gie, nor hath at any time Religion been that way in any tolerable
measure reformed: When the evils are extraordinary, the remedies must be other then ordinary. Scripture, reason, and experience of the Kirk teach in such an exigence of Reformation and extremitie of de∣bates and contentions, to call a Synod of the best Divines, best ac∣quainted with the will of God in Scripture, freest of humane inventi∣ons, and innovations, and farrest from pride and avarice; which are the evils to be purged out, and for afterward prevented; And who against al Sects and Shismes, unfainedly seek the peace and unity of the Kirk, which by all good meanes both for it self, and for the truths sake, is to bee procured and preserved. When by this remedie faithfully ap∣plied, and accompanied with prayers, and tears of repentance; the worship of God and the government of the Kirk are setled, not after the rules of humane policie, but according to Scripture, there is hope that God wil end his controversie with England, and blisse the treaties of peace betwixt your Majestie and your Parliament; which is now our humble desire, and when it cometh to passe, shall be the universall rejoycing of all your good people. We should be not onely unchristian but disloyall and unnaturall, if we were not affected, and afflicted, with your Majesties many suf∣ferings, and the troubles of your Kingdoms, and did not heartily wish that your Majestie were pesent in your Parliament, assembled in the most peaceable and Parliamentarie way, to your Majesties greater glorie, and their greater strengthening, for the good of the Kingdom. For the present, the houses of Parliament have professed in their De∣claration to the Generall Assembly, their desires and willingnesse, to settle such a Reformation of the Kirk; as shall be most agreeable to the word of God, and most apt to procure and conserve an happy union with the Kirk of Scotland in a peaceable and parliamentarie way; And have passe their bills in both houses without contradiction against Episcopall governement, and offered them to your Majestie for obtaining your Royall consent: This is the peaceable and Par∣liamentarie way, meant by us, and mentioned in our petition, which we trust can give your Majestie no just offence. Although the Ministers of the Gospel have authority in some ca∣ses to preach and write not only exhortations, and blessings, but also threats, and sentences of judgement, against Kings and Kingdoms, which howsoever they be bitter and unpleasant for the pesent (and therefore seldom ministred to princes) may prove very profitable,
and cordiall afterward: Many had perished in their sins if it had not been told them that they were to perish; faithfull are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemie are deceitfull: and he that rebu∣keth, afterwards shall find more favour then hee that flattereth with the tongue. Yet upon good reason have we abstained from this strain of denuncing of judgement against your Majesty, having onely from the conscience of our duty in anguish of our souls, faithfully represen∣ted the duty and danger with our earnest deprecation of the wrath not only now incumbent, but yet seven times more imminent to your Kingdomes, which we daily more and more apprehend, shall ensue, unlesse by a through Reformation of Religion and manners it bee timeously prevented. By this our liberty we have delivered our owne soules, and endevoured to deliver your Majesty and your Dominions from the present and future judgements, which both love and feare constrain us now again; To entreat your Majesty to hearken unto. As we cannot deny, but do reverently acknowledge the influence of many and great blessings from heaven upon the reigne of Queen Eli∣zabeth and your Majesties Father of blessed memory: So doe we not doubt, but your Majesty in your Christian and Royall wisedome will consider: that the supreme providence which hath set your Ma∣jestie after them upon the Throne, hath appointed a time for every action. A wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgement, and where it is not discerned, the misery of man, wrestling with invincible providence, is great upon him. The many blessings upon the Kings of Egypt, Babylon, and other Princes, were interrupted in the time of their successours, which opposed the deliverance of the people of God from the Egyptian bondage, the Babylonian captivity, the foolishnesse of Paganisme, and the tyrannie of Popery, when the time of their de∣liverance was come. Many of the godly before your Majesties reigne have desired and supplicated the Parliament for a Reformation, but the desires were never so universall as now; Prelacie never so insolent, nor the evils thereof so well knowne and so deeply felt; nor was it ever voted out of the Parliament, nor agreed in Parliament to be abo∣lished in the Kirk; nor stood meerly upon the Royall consent of the King, till this time. Arminianisme hath entered, Papistry hath en∣creased, Sectaries have multiplied, sufferings have abounded, Tender consciences disquieted with old and new ceremonies, much more of late then before, that all eyes may see how many things concur now to
make a necessity of reformation. It is the never dying honour of your Majesties late Progenitors above others that were before them, that they did begin, continue and preserve reformation, and shall be your Majesties greatest and immortall glory to perfect it, with Josiah lea∣ving nothing to imped or obscure the glory of God: An happinesse which the people of God in this Iland have long waited for, which God calleth for at your hands, and we trust hath reserved for our times, as a speciall and incomparable honour to your Majestie above the best Princes, and matter of joy to your people above all other in former ages. As the continuall comfort and daily sense of the inestimable bene∣fit, of the Reformation of this Kirk in worship and government, should stir up our hearts, to the love of God, whose hand principal∣ly, did bring it about, in a way full of marvels, and full of mercies, And thankfulnesse to your Majestie, whom we look upon, not as a na∣ked assenter unto alterations, but as a prime instrument of setling a blessed Reformation in this Kirk; So doth the same comfort and sense excite in us, a fear to lose that which we so much love, in a way where in it hath run hazard before. Our fears are not counterfeit, to bring any designe of our own, nor politick, or created in us, by the authoritie of any assertion of others, to bring any designe of theirs to passe, nor panick, or maginarie, to torment our selves without cause; But are true and reall, grounded upon reason, which teacheth to beware of contagion, in so neer a vicinitie, and where there is so frequent commerce and conversing upon by-past experience of evils from English Prelacie, ever since the beginning of Reformation, and upon present and daily tasting of the fruits, which partly of its own corupt nature, and partly through the coruptions of men, It hath brought forth & fomented. And though the Petitioners cannot judge, nor should intermeddle with questions about your Maiesties, and the Parliaments power, yet may they well professe from that which every one may understand, that the denying of the people their earnest de∣sires, may quench that fervour of affection which is due from a people to their Prince. Whether the generality of the Nation desireth a change of Kirk go∣vernment, cannot be better known then by the desires and Propositi∣ons of the representative bodie of the Kingdome, nor can it be better defined what government shall be established, than in Synod of lear∣ned
and godly Divines. Our part is to wish the pattern in Scripture and the example of the best Reformed Kirks to be followed, and to pray that God by his Spirit may lead them into all truth: being con∣fident that reformation having begun by your Majesties authority at the head and chiefest parts, all sectaries, and all the inferiour mem∣bers may be quickly by a Synod brought to such order as may consist with truth and with the peace of the Kirk. It was farre from our intentions by the generall expressions of our Petition against Papists, To charge your Majesty with complyance and favour to their opinions. We doe from our hearts blesse God for all that your Majesty hath done both here and in England against them, and for so free and ample a testimony of your Majesties de∣sires of the Queenes conversion. Jealousies of that kinde, and hopes in the hearts of such as are popishly affected, of their prevailing power, proceed from the power of Papists in Ireland, the present posture of Papists armed about your Majesty in this dangerous time of combustion in England, and that for so long a time through the connivence or complyance of the Ministers of estate, lawes, have not beene execute against them, nor any meanes at all used for the Queenes conversion. A necessary and essentiall duty, from which no oath to the contrary can more give dispensation, then any oath of old or late, publike or private, can bind your Majesty to main∣taine Episcopacy or any corruption in the worship of God, or go∣vernment of the Kirk, when God by his word giveth light and by his providence calleth for a Reformation. All which had neede to be seriously and tymously considered. And if the Papists be not speedi∣ly disarmed, the danger is that both in their owne project, and upon the hearing of your Majesties Declaration to disarme them, when there shall be no more use of their service, they band together and bend all their wits against a Pacification, till by their gathering and growing to greater strength, they be able to plead in equall termes for themselves, for their share in the places and honours of the King∣dome, at least for peace and tolleration, as a reward of all their paines, charges and hazards, pretended to be for your Majesties ho∣nour and safety, but really intended for themselves and their super∣stition. We cannot conceive that loyalty can be without allege∣ance, or that Papists refusing to take the oath of allegeance, doe fight in loyalty and allegeance to your Majesty, but for their owne
ends, nor can it be safe for Protestants to trust them upon the prin∣ciples of their profession, in any whether intestine or forraigne war. In the time of the greatest forraigne invasion yeere 88. It was not thought safe to arme the Papists in defence of the Kingdome. We did not take notice of Papists in the other army, in our Petition to your Majesty, but did in our Declaration to the Parliament, that although they had professed in their Declarations that they had no knowne Papists in their Army, yet if any were found to be, we de∣sired they might in like manner be disbanded. Brownists, Anabap∣tists, and other sectaries which are the fruits of Prelacy one way as Papists are another, are neither so easily knowne as Papists nor so much to be feared: and although they be enemies to Religion and to the peace of the Kirk, we know not whether they have beene so considerable that the law hath taken so farre notice of them as to disarme them. We have so sincerely and from the inward of our spirits, with our hearts and hands lifted up to the most high God the searcher of hearts, sworne the care of the safety of your Majesties person, and of your greatnesse and authority, which we have also witnessed in our Declarations to the Houses of Parliament, that our hearts within us were wounded when we did heare of the danger your Majesties person was in the 23 of October. And as we doe with the Houses of Parliament (as is expressed in their Declaration) rejoyce and heartily praise God for your safety, So doe we not cease to pray for your Majesties preservation in the midst of so many dangers, and for a speedy deliverance by a happy peace, which we trust shall bury that blacke and unnaturall day so unhappie and dangerous both to your Majestie and your people in eternall oblivion, and therefore not to be paralelled by us with the unparalelled plot of the 5. of November never to be forgotten. We have detained your Majestie longer then your great affaires of governing Kingdomes in the time of warre could well permit, but not so long as the charge committed to us by the Generall Assem∣blie, and the importance of our Petition, which is of religious and publike concernment doth require. The crime of bitternesse and want of reverence to your Majesty, the challenge of usurpation, the aspersion of so much and manifold mistaking, we would beare the more patiently if we were to be considered as private and particular
persons, and not as Commissioners of publike trust: And yet doe beare the more patiently, because we take them (and in this no man shall perswade us that we are mistaken) to proceed from the pen of the writer, and not from your Majesties justice and goodnesse, unto which we are bold to appeale from his unjust censure, and from such slanderous tongues and pens as by traducing the preaching and prayers of the ministery here of disloyalty or sedition, doe much wrong us, your Majestie much more, and truth and peace most of all. Your Majesty in your wisedome will consider what such Syco∣phants are seeking, and in your justice will rather beleeve our pub∣like testimony, in things best knowne to our selves and to our ordi∣nary hearers, then any private information flowing from the malice of some, or the weaknesse of others. And now in your royall good∣nesse will be graciously pleased to suffer us your Majesties most humble and faithfull Subjects to fall downe at your feet, and with all earnestnesse to renew our Petition, especially that of Unity in Religion, and uniformity of Kirk Government in all your Majesties Dominions, which we conceive to be principally, intended by divine Providence in these unhappy distractions and troubles of your Ma∣jesties Kingdomes; And to this effect for such an Ecclesiasticall Assemblie, as hath beene formerly described and desired: A meane so pious, so just and so ordinary in such cases as malice it selfe can have no colour to object against your Majesty for using it. And which shall speedily bring on a firme and grounded peace, and with peace all other blessings spirituall and temporall upon your Majesty and your Kingdomes. A. Ker. Cl. Commiss. Gen. Ass.
