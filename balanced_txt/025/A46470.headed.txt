royal blazon or coat of arms C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT His Majesties GRACIOUS DECLARATION To all His Loving Subjects for Liberty of Conscience. JAMES R. IT having pleased Almighty God not only to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms through the greatest Difficulties, but to preserve Us by a more than ordinary Providence upon the Throne of Our Royal Ancestors, There is nothing now that We so earnestly desire, as to Establish Our Go∣vernment on such a Foundation, as may make Our Subjects happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as Duty; Which We think can be done by no Means so effectually, as by Granting to them the free Exercise of their Religion for the Time to come, and add that to the perfect enjoyment of their Property, which has ne∣ver been in any Case Invaded by Us since Our coming to the Crown which being the two Things Men value most, shall ever be preserve
Reign over them, as the truest Methods  We cannot but heartily wish, as it  all the People of Our Dominions were  urch, yet We humbly thank Almighty  been Our constant Sense and Opinion (which upon diverse Occasions We have Declared) That Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor People forced in Matters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly contrary to Our Inclination, as We think it is to the Interest of Government, which it destroys by Spoiling Trade, Depopulating Countries, and Discouraging Stran∣gers; and finally, that it never obtained the End for which it was employed: And in this We are the more confirmed by the Reflections We have made upon the Conduct of the Four last Reigns. For after all the frequent and Pressing Endeavors that were used in each of them, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, it is visible the Success has not answered the Design, and that the Dif∣ficulty is invincible. We therefore out of Our Princely Care and Affection unto all our Loving Subjects, that they may live at Ease and Quiet, and for the increase of Trade, and encouragement of Strangers, have thought fit by virtue of Our Royal Prerogative, to Issue forth this Our Declaration of Indulgence; making no doubt of the Con∣currence of Our Two Houses of Parliament, when We shall think it convenient for them to Meet. In the first Place We do Declare, That We will Protect and Maintain Our Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and Clergy, and all other Our Subjects of the Church of England, in the free Exercise of their Religion, as by Law Established, and in the quiet and full Enjoyment of all their Pos∣sessions, without any Molestation or Disturbance whatsoever. VVe do likewise Declare, That it is our Royal VVill and Pleasure, That from henceforth the Execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Ecclesiastical, for not coming to Church, or not Re∣ceiving the Sacrament, or for any other Non-conformity to the Re∣ligion Established, or for or by reason of the Exercise of Religion in any manner whatsoever, be immediately Suspended; And the fur∣ther Execution of the said Penal Laws and every of them is hereby Suspended. And to the end that by the Liberty hereby Granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice thereof may not be en∣dangered, We have thought fit, and do hereby straitly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects, That as We do freely give them Leave to Meet and Serve God after their own VVay and Manner, be it in private Houses, or Places purposely Hired or Built for that use; So that they take especial care, that nothing be Preached or Taught a∣mongst them which may any ways tend to Alienate the Hearts of Our People from Us or Our Government; And that their Meetings and Assemblies be peaceably, openly, and publickly held, and all Persons freely admitted to them; And that they do signifie and
make known to some one or more of the next Justices of the Peace, what Place or Places they set apart for those uses. And that all Our Subjects may enjoy such their Religious Assem∣blies with greater Assurance and Protection, We have thought it Requisite, and do hereby Command, That no Disturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under Pain of our Displeasure, and to be further proceeded against with the uttermost Severity. And forasmuch as We are desirous to have the Benefit of the Ser∣vice of all Our Loving Subjects, which by the Law of Nature is inse∣parably annexed to, and inherent in Our Royal Person; And that none of Our Subjects may for the future be under any Discouragement or Disability (who are otherwise well inclined and fit to Serve Us) by reason of some Oaths or Tests, that have been usually Administred on such Occasions: We do hereby further Declare, That it is Our Royal VVill and Pleasure, That the Oaths commonly called, The Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and also the several Tests and De∣clarations mentioned in the Acts of Parliament made in the 25th and 30th Years of the Reign of Our late Royal Brother King Charles the Second, shall not at any time hereafter be required to be Taken, De∣clared, or Subscribed by any Person or Persons whatsoever, who is or shall be Employed in any Office or Place of Trust, either Civil or Military, under Us or in Our Government. And VVe do further Declare it to be Our Pleasure and Intention from time to time here∣after, to Grant Our Royal Dispensations under Our Great Seal to all Our Loving Subjects so to be Employed, who shall not take the said Oaths, or Subscribe or Declare the said Tests or Declarations in the abovementioned Acts and every of them. And to the end that all Our Loving Subjects may receive and en∣joy the full Benefit and Advantage of Our Gracious Indulgence here∣by intended, and may be Acquitted and Discharged from all Pains, Penalties, Forfeitures, and Disabilities by them or any of them in∣curred or forfeited, or which they shall or may at any time hereafter be liable to, for or by reason of their Non-conformity, or the Exer∣cise of their Religion, and from all Suits, Troubles, or Disturbances for the same: We do hereby give Our Free and Ample Pardon unto all Non-conformists, Recusants, and other Our Loving Subjects, for all Crimes and Things by them committed or done contrary to the Penal Laws formerly made relating to Religion and the Profession or Exercise thereof, Hereby Declaring, That this Our Royal Pardon and Indempnity shall be as Good and Effectual to all Intents and Pur∣poses, as if every Individual Person had been therein particularly na∣med, or had particular Pardons under our Great Seal, which VVe do likewise Declare shall from time to time be Granted unto any Person or Persons desiring the same: Willing and Requiring Our Judges, Justices, and other Officers, to take Notice of and Obey Our Royal VVill and Pleasure herein before Declared;
And although the Freedom and Assurance We have hereby given in relation to Religion and Property, might be sufficient to remove from the Minds of Our Loving Subjects all Fears and Jealousies in relation to either; yet We have thought fit further to Declare, That We will Maintain them in all their Properties and Possessions, as well of Church and Abby-Lands, as in any other their Lands and Properties whatsoever. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Fourth Day of April, 1687. In the Third Year of Our Reign. By His Majesties special Command.
