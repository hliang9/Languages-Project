For the Souldiers, and all the Officers of England, Scotland and Ireland, a warning from the Lord, that they forget not his kindness, but call to mind his mercies, and their own promises. ALL ye Governers, Captains, Officers and Souldiers, to you all am I moved to write, and clear my Conscience, and declare the word of the Lord; The mercies of the Lord have been great towards you, by his power hath he subdued your enemies in the Nations before you, and given you victory over them. Now to that in all your Consciences I do speak; Consider how you walk answerable in obedience to the Lord, from whom you have had power to overcome your enemies; consider if you be not requiting the Lord evil for all his mercies? O I am pressed to consider and see! what seeking of your selves? and what exalta∣tion of your selves is amongst you? O what pride and high-mindedness, and lusts of the flesh is to be seen in you? O what vain and wanton minds, and careless spirits doth appear from you? Dreadfull will the appearance of the Lord of Hoasts be unto you in requiring his mercies, and how you have improved them, which you have received from him; O the righteous seed of God is oppressed in you, and the just lies slain under the powers of the man of sin, which rules in many of you, above all that is called God; you have well ngh forgotten the mercies of the Lord, which gave you power over your enemies, and your hearts are overcome with pride, and seeking the honor, and treasure, and glory of this world, and even with Jesurum you are waxed fat, and kick against the Lord; some are pulled down, others are set up; but the same nature stands still, which is at enmity with God, and the same Laws stand still, by which the Lords people (for conscience sake) do suffer, and the same false Prophets stand still, which deceive the Nations, and by corrupt Laws (which you have pretended to fight against) are they upholden, and the spirit of the Lords people limited, and the same oppressing Lawyers stand still, which grinds the face of the poor. O consider, and perform your Covenant to the Lord, which you made to him in the day of your distress, when you were little in your own eyes; lest the wrath of the Almighty come upon you, and you be scattered and driven away before the power of the Lord, as your enemies have been before you. Liber∣ty to tender consciences, and to take away the oppressing Laws was your pretence; But how little is it yet accomplished? For great is and hath been the sufferings of the ords People in the North parts of Eng∣land, under corrupt Laws, even by such as were made in Queen Maries days, to uphold Popery; for the Testimony of a pure conscience, hath and doth many suffer by such Laws, and under such men which have been your open enemies; even such men which have been in actual Arms against you, are now ex∣alted, and put in Authority, and with Tiranny Rule over the Lords people, which have been faithful and serviceable to you; and for the good of the Nations to establish them in Righteousness; Consider, its time to weigh these things, you are at ease in your lusts and pleasures, and many of you are wofully fallen from that zeal for truth, which once was really in you, and now forget to perform the Covenant of the Lord, and liberty to the pure Conscience you have not yet attained; but you walk in the liberty of your Wills, and Lusts, and Desires, and that nature keeps in bondage in you, that which should set free the Conscience to serve the Lord; and many of those whom it hath pleased the Lord by his power to set free that in their Conscience, to serve and worship him, are now oppressed and suffer under corrupt Laws, which is acted by the corrupt wills of corrupt men, and liberty of Conscience is not, nor can be attained by the power of an outward sword, but by the light of Jesus Christ, which is the sword which cuts down the man of sin, and power of darkness, which keeps in bondage that in the Conscience which would bring it to Li∣berty. And though it be not in your power, nor in the power of man to perform what you have promised; yet such a work, and so much power hath the Lord intrusted in your hands, which you neglect, and do not improve; for which the Lord of Hoasts will plead with you, and bring misery and condemnation upon you; He hath said it, who will perform his word. And now hath the Lord God of power drawn his sword, and a new open war is proclaimed in the North parts of England, even betwixt Michael our Prince, and the Dragon; The Trumpet of the Lord is sounding, and he is appearing in his power for the deliverance of Sion, which hath long lain in Captivity; and he will gather his flock out of the mouths of all dumb shep∣herds, which hath for many Generations made a prey upon them; the Lord hath set up his standard to gather his men of war together, to fight his Battle against the enemies of Sion, the deceivers of the Nati∣ons, and the Lord will by his own power accomplish that which you have not been able: Wo, wo and misery, lamentation, and howling, a voice of war and rumor is coming upon the Beast and the false Pro∣phet, and upon corrupt Laws and Rulers, the decree of the Lord of Hoasts is gone forth against all the Deceivers, both of Rulers, Teachers and People; and he will make their shame, and their whoredoms and witchcrafts appear in the eyes of all his people, and will set his people to Triumph over their heads, and to rejoyce in their downfall, the hand of the Lord is stretched out against them, to make a destruction among them, and wo unto them which takes their part to uphold them; they that help, and they that are holpen shall both sall together: for the Lord hath a controversie with them, and with them will he plead by his terrible judgements; The Teachers have devoured souls for dishonest gain, and made a trade upon the holy Scriptures, and walked in the footsteps of their orefathers, the false Prophets of Israel; and the Rulers, and Lawyers have done violence, and oppressed the innocent, and trodden the poor underfoot: Therefore ye Souldiers take warning, this is the Word of the Lord to you all; Uphold them nor, lest with them you fall before the power of the Lord, which is making it self manifest in the Saints, to cut them down Branch and Root; to that in all your Consciences I do speak; all ye Officers and Souldiers, fear the living God, and Repent of your Pride and self-exaltation, and hard-heartedness, and prize the mercies of the Lord, which you have received, and all the honest-hearted wait upon the Lord, in the light where∣with Jesus Christ hath lightned every one of you; the light in your Consciences, (according to its measure) shews you what is according to the will of God, and what is contrary to his will, and bears witness to what I say, it Judges you in secret, for your actions which are contrary to a pure Conscience; So turn your minds inward to the light, and wait to be taught of the Lord, that as his power hath appeared for you, in giving you Victory over your enemies without you; so his power may be made manifest in you, to give you victo∣ry over the man of sin (which leads you into pride, and to seek your selves) which is your enemy within you; the Lord hath a seed amongst you, which he will set free and deliver to serve his name; So be you all warned, for to you all I have cleared my Conscience, and spoke the word of the Lord, whether you will hear or forbear, and when that witness of God in your Consciences dth arise, eternally shall it witness me; And let you see that I have spoken the truth, and that you are guilty of Covenant-breaking. This was I moved to write to the English Army in England, Scotland and Ireland; and to them all it is the word of the Lord. My name in the flesh is Edward Burrough, one of them whom the world calls Quakers.
