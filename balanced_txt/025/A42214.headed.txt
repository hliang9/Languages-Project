Licensed, March 13th 1664/5. ROGER LESTRANGE,
TO THE Right HONOURABLE, CHARLES Viscount Fitz-Harding, AND Earl of Falmouth. MEN, as the Philosopher saith, Most Noble Sir, are rude, barbarous, and worthy of nothing but Contempt, unless their Natures be refined by Learning and Knowledg; a main Instrument for the attaining whereof is History; which, as the Learned Livy saith, Hoc illa praecipuè agit in rerum cognitione salubre et frugiferum, omnis te exempli documenta in illu∣stri posita monumento, intueri, unde Tibi tuae{que} Rei∣pub: quod imites capias, unde foedum incaeptu, foedum exitu, quod vites: This I take to be meant by him in general of History; which, without offence of the more Learned, I hope may be extended to the various
Discourses of particular Countries; especially such, whose near vicinity, as to Friendship or Enmity, is requisite to be known, as well in its greatness, as mean beginning: A Wise-man ought not to find fault with those things, which he sees written, because he doth not approve there∣of, but rather will set a high esteem thereon, because others are experienced in those things whereof he is ignorant; wherein the Candor of your Lordships Judgment appears glorious, as using to try all things rather by the measure of unerring Truth, than the deceitful Fancy of a byassed Judgment. The famous Author Hugo Grotius, though eminent for Learning in his Country, and by his own Repute able to bear up against the Malevolent Blusters of Envy, yet were his Posthume Works glad to crave the Protection of Superiours, by whose Approbation, they have gone through the World, meriting the highest Applause. And there∣fore, I humbly hope, the unworthiness of the Translator, in his being unknown to your Honour, will not in any measure lessen the well-known Repute of the Author, whose Impartial Pen, hath with that Candor deliver'd his Countrey-mens Actions, as gives not the Credit of their Greatness, to their own Policy or Strength, but yields a deserved Lawrel to the honour of the English, whose Aid was not onely as a Hand to uphold, but a vi∣vifying Medicine to a fainting Body, that recals and gives new Spirit to a formless and cadaverous Lump. I shall not trouble your Lordship with the Reasons inducing to this Translation at this time, as well-knowing it would be too great an Intrenchment upon the full Occasions, which hardly afford your Honour any time of Repose:
And therefore I humbly crave your Lordships Pardon, for this bold Intrusion, beseeching your favourable Re∣spect to Patronize this Translation, which I prostrate to you, as the most hopeful Stem of Rising Nobility, as being replete with all the Advantages flowing from a large and plentiful Fortune; wherewith not onely your Body is enriched, but your Mind copiously embelished, with all the Helps both of Art and Nature. Accept then hereof, and make it receive a value, if not from its own Worth, yet from your Approbation: Which that it may do, is the Desire of, MY LORD, Your Lordships in all service to be commanded, T. MANLEY.
To the READER. IT is a Crime too incident to Humane Frailty to be finding fault, though they undergo the Lash of the Satyrical Poet for it, Turpe est Doctori cum culpae redarguit ipsum; And I cannot expect to be free from such Calumniators: But I hope better things from the Ingenious Readers, who, if I flatter not my self, will be inforced to acknowledge, That if I have not arrived at the highest Pitch of the Author's Fancy, yet that I have not deviated from the same. You have here the first Rise of the Quondam Poor Distressed States; which, as the Author confesseth, was by a Revolt from their Lawful Soveraign: And the Sacred Scripture parallels Rebellion to the Sin of Witchcraft. But, Success brought in that Pagan Principle, Prosperum Scelus vocatur Virtus: And from this Step they assumed the Title of High and Mighty: Yet is it not forgot, that Babel should have reach'd to Heaven, but was destroyed. Our Author, as he ingeniously acknowledgeth the Rise and Growth, so he often brings them forth with their Humble Suit for Aid and Assistance; and afterwards, with the Expressions of their humble and hearty Acknowledgments to Queen Elizabeth, as their main Support, in their most distressed Condi∣tion: And with more Humble supplications to her,
Not to leave them to the Rage of their Enemies, but to continue them under the Wings of Her Protection; unto which Protection, out of her meer Mercy and Compassion, she admitted them; Because of the Inhumane Cruelties committed upon them by the Bloody Duke D' Alva: And though They in all humility offered unto her Submission, as to their Prince, (such was their low Condition) yet, notwithstanding their Preservation by the English Nation, so often acknowledged by Them∣selves; they, like the ungrateful Snake, endea∣vour to destroy their Foster-Father, forgetting all their Obligations to England, and offering all the Violencies imaginable, which, with Amboyna, shall not now be particularized. These are the Wars, which most Christian Prin∣ces were concerned in: writ they have been by others; but this the onely Protestant Writer, whose Impartial Pen needs onely to be named to give in Credit. And how seasonly Translated at this Juncture of Time, their own Confessions in those past, and their unjust Proceedings in the present Affairs, will sufficiently testifie. T. M.
GROTIUS OF THE Affairs of the Netherlands. The ANNALS of Hugo Grotius, concerning the Dutch Affairs, from the Departure of King PHILIP. The Frst B. I Intend to Discourse the most famous Warre of our Times, and which may no improperly be clled So∣ciall, or a Warre of Confederates, while the Spaniard and Dutch, People accustomed to live under one Go∣vernment, and who had as well been Victors, as Compani∣ons in Arms, differ between themselves, nor wanteth Rea∣son why it may not be termed a Civil War, the Parties here∣in concerned under the several Title of the Pince, and the Laws being Domestick: And wheher we mind the Policies either of Civil or Military Government, we shall not find a
more fertile Field of Examples, nor in any Age more fierce and tedious Conflicts, in such an unequal Quarrel: You would admire how the Seeds of this Hostility were long be∣fore sown, but after they began to grow up and appear, it would even tire Curiosity to observe the great Mens Power and Craft, the desperation of the meaner sort, the new Leagues, and immediately the Home-Discords, and at last the unhappy endeavouring of Forraign Aid; whereto, in short time after, were added the frequent Assaults, takings, and re-takings of Towns and Castles, Marches and Re-Marches of Armies, till sometimes they met to Battel, Passa∣ges to and fro by Sea, long Sieges, and indeed all kind of Martial Discipline, improved to the utmost, by signal Experi∣ment: But these things being done in publike, whereby each Party strengthned his own Affairs, and turned all occa∣sions into Force, I shall more easily accomplish, in regard I have them, as nearer, so more certain, and consequently not to be prevented, much less amended by others at a greater distance. The beginnings of this War, though very incertain, because much unknown and dark in its occasion, many fa∣mous Writers have undertaken, even in the Latine Tongue, to describe: But in regard you cannot well understand those without some further Director, I thought it not amiss to de∣clare at large, the first Causes of those Tumultuous Proceed∣ings, which intervened there from the beginning, that at one short View, Counsels and Policies may be compaed one with the other, together with the Event produced by the same. And in truth, so great and famous have the Actions there done, been, that even Strangers have been cuious in writing thereof; and therefore we certainly should be ac∣counted most ingrate to our Countre, and envious of the good of our Posterity, if we should not give them a most ex∣act Relation of those things which hapned so near them; E∣specially since most of our Modern Writers have too fre∣quently deluded their Readers Credulity, with vain and un∣certain
Rumours, as either Party, for their own advantage, published the same; or else if any had Desire or Opportuni∣ty of knowing the Truth, even such contented themselves to write onely a Diurnall; My Design is to lay open and discuss the Peoples Commotions, the Consultations of the great Ones and Governours, and whence a new Soveraignty sprang, where the first determined. The People that  hbit the Land within the Rhene as also on both sides thereof, to he Se of he Morim, and the River Amasius, on this side called Germany, on the other, Old Bel∣gium, their Country; but most of them are beholding to Ger∣many, as well for their Language, as their Original; whence it was, that while the Romans strove to bring in their Arts and Commerce these jointly taking Care, both of their Liber∣ty, and the Warre, at once, were Companions in Loss or Conquerours: Neither did they ever lse the Repute of good Warriors, though they most shewed their Vlours, ei∣ther in others Ayd, or their own Rebellions. But when the Generality of People, as it were upon one Sgnal, made vio∣lent Incursions into the Roman Empire, all this ract fel to the share of the Franks; until in the Division of their Power, part became the Possessions of the Kings of France, and other part the Emperors of Germany claimed as their Right. But both, when they themselves were from thence far distant, st Governors, by the Names of Earls, Dukes, and the like, to rule and defend all the Cities therein, saving onely such as for the sake of Religion, were given unto Bishops, when Christiani∣ty began to increase and flourish: Such as were sent forth to the Wars in Command, were called Dukes, to whom Earles or Counts were such as took Care of the Accounts of Subsi∣dies, and other Taxes, for the Souldiers Pay, and were chief Judges: But it is a thing hardly credible, how both these and those did augment their Power in a short time, by these three means, their own Valour and Vertue, their Princes neglect and Carelessness, and the Favour and Good-will of the Pro∣vincials.
For first, they got themselves Power and Authority, by doing good to all; nor did they shew more Audacity and Courage in time of War, than Moderation and Religion in Times of Peace. In this manner strengthning themselves, in∣stead of a Lieutenantship, (which was all they had at first) they attain to themselves a perpetual and Hereditary Domi∣nion, which was with the more Facility and Complyance granted to them, because when any Wars broke out in those Parts, they were the more ready to meet and undergo the Dangers and Hazards thereof, in regard they defended their own Territories: For, in those Times, the Seas were almost covered and the Shores even beset and filled with Danish and Norman Fleets: Not long after, taking a Priviledge, either from the Fear or Favour of their Followers, or the Breach and Decay of a greater Lordship, though they kept the same Re∣semblance still in Name, yet they established a Soveraign and lawful Authority even with the Peoples good-will. Lands are set apart for the Princes, and moderate Tributes: yet e∣nough to support and maintain their Dignity; for they gave not themselves over to Covetousness and luxury, or those o∣ther Crimes, which in the Innocency of that Age were scarce known to the World: Onely the Desire of Rule, and Thirst of Dominion (aged almost as Nature) they could not ex∣cuse themselves from. Hence it was, they had perpetuall Wars, either among themselves, or with their Bordering Neighbors; for managing whereof, they never hired Forrein Souldiers, but used their own People, who for the safe keep∣ing of their Borders, would strive who should be foremost in the Watch; and if Ambition or Honour had invited the Prince beyond, they forthwith followed him with Alacrity, moved thereto as well by the hopes of Praise, as Reward: The Conquerour bestowing in Gift on his Noblest Souldiers, Lands in Fee-Farm, and confirming on Cities and Citizens, their Franchises, Customs. Laws, and Magistracy, the sure Guards and Defences of their Liberty. Nor did their Successors
take upon them the full power of Government, before they had confirm'd by Oath these Grants, on whom they were at first bestowed. The whole Charge of the Common-Wealth, was of old said upon the Shoulders of the Nobility and Governours of Towns, which consisted of the Communalty, to whom in some places the Clergy were added: These, where it was necessary, met together concerring Embassies; These Consulted of the great Affairs of State; nor was it lawful, without the general Consent of all, to set a Tribute or Tax, to alter the present state of Affairs, nor to much as enhance or debase the value of Coy. So much Caution was there used, even when they had good Princes, to prevent the encroaching of Evil Ones. The most Noble and Vertuous amongst the Citizens, underwent and performed all publike Offices, and all Strangers were kept out of the Princes Court, the Senate, and all other places, ei∣ther of Honour or Profit. By the observance of these good Customs, long did the Common-Wealth continue fix't on a good Basis. But at length by little and little Seditions grow∣ing up, wasted this flourishing and rich People, untill by ma∣ny Victories, Affinities, and Treaties, most of them were glad to submit to the Burgundian Government, who being sprung from a Royal House, Warlike, Crafty, and dating, to under∣take any thing, to Arm his Power from the Dssnions of the Nobles, Promises to one, Threatens another, and give Re∣wards to a Third: Thus, in a short time, all things bow, ei∣ther for Reward, or fear of Punishment; and he is ready to destroy the Force of their promiscuous Liberty, by an extra∣ordinary Act of Authority, according to the French Exem∣plar: For every several Nation hath his own Senate appoint∣ed him, but all were to attend the Common Justice of Mck∣lin, by which means they more easily represented the Form of one City: A Colledge also, or Fraternity, by the Name of the Golden Fleece, was Erected, whereby he obliged the Princes admitted into the same, that were famous both for
their Extract and Merits, to be to him both an Honour and a Safeguard. Among all these Policies, the States maintain∣ed the Peoples Right, whom out of the several Nations, he called to meet in one Common-Councel, as oft as the Com∣mon Treasury was drained by his Wars, or other Necessity required the same: Being sent thither, they oft-times did great things for the Common-Wealth; and that which added to their Courage was, that they might speak what they had in Commission. There was not a Castle, nor in time of Peace a Souldier, except a few Garrisons upon the uttermost Borders, suspected from the frequent Motions of the French; toge∣ther with Three Thousand Horsemen, the Flower of all the Nobility, yet Commanded by the Chief of the Popularity, and were in readiness against any sudden Incursions, and such a Number of private Ships, ready upon my unexpected Occasion, as would over-umber a good Fleet. This great Accumulation of Fortune, being transposed un∣to the Austrian Family, though it made the Power of Spain greatly to increase, yet the mild Natures of those in Autho∣rity, by their Moderation, augmented their Power; and cer∣tainly, sooner by this Act is Liberty overthrown and con∣quered, than by Force: For Fierceness grows into Fury, while it resists Compulsion, when Meekness and Courteries will even hand men into Obedience; untill accustomed Du∣ties being commanded, the long License of Evil Habits, makes that Obedience seem to be Slavery. In the mean time, to the Commons who meddle not with Arms, the Benefits of Merchandizing and Trades is frequently shewn, whereby the Customes and Tributes are encreased, and that private men grown rich, if they would be innocent, must with Care shun publike Imployments. This Spanish Conjunction, was a very great Augmentation: But now, as if grown more wise, as the Wealth of those in Superiority over them mightily increased, they began to suspect with a kind of Dread, from the Spaniards Behaviour, which they had Opportunity
enough to look into, in the time of their Service together in the Wars; as also, from the Difference between them, a Change of their Common-Wealth: For while Bordering Nations have from a like Stock, by the same Endeavours in∣creased, they easily agree between themselves, engaged there∣unto by a kind of Brotherly Relation: But the Spaniard and Dutch differ in many, nay in most things; and in those they agree, they meet with too much vehemency. Both have been famous in Martial Exploits for many Ages, unless that these have disused, those by Italian, and other Forreign Expeditions, are encouraged through long Discipline and Rewards. The Dutch are very sedulous and diligent, and, for the hope of gain willing to undergo any labour, do by that means ac∣quire both Trade and Peace; yet do they not use to take and put up Injuries: and as they are greedy after other mens goods, so in defence of their own they will contend to the uttermost; which hath been the cause, that in this single Re∣gion there are so many Cities, and those that are scituate near the Sea, or any other River, strongly fortified, and every where else so replenished by their own, and a mixt multitude of persons from other Countries: Thus since those monstrous Incursions from the Northern Parts of the Earth were blown over, have they for Eight Ages continued unconquered and free from the spoyls of forreign Armies. But Spain, after it had contracted from the variety of its Victors, many of their Customes, and great diversity in their manners, at last was forced to yield her Neck to the Gothish Servitude: by which mixt cohabitation and intermingled breeding, they came even to unite in nature and disposition, of whom both Ancient and Modern Authors have given us this Character, That they were of invincible spirits to undergo all manner of hardships and dangers, whereby it was scrupled by the rest of the World, Whether they were more greedy of Ho∣nour or Wealth? They are proud and arrogant beyond mea∣ure, even to the contempt of all others; they are very great
honourers of things Sacred, having Religion in high esteem, which makes them neither unmindful of nor ungrateful for benefits received; but in revenge so furious is their heat, and in victory, so barbarous their cruelty, that they think nothing in such case done to an enemy either unlawful or dishonoura∣ble. Thee things are quite contrary to the Dutch a Nation innocently crafty, and after the manner of their scituation which is between France and Germany they are moderate both in their Customes and Conditions, in some measure participating of the Vices of both, yet not altogether with∣out some of their Vertues: You cannot easily deceive them, you must nor unadvisedly insult over them. Nor in matters of Divine Worship, in former time did they in ought come behind the Spaniard, being unanimous eve since they first put on Christianity; not so terrified by the Norman Arms as to change their profession, nor yet ever infected with any damnable errour: They bestowed so much upon Religion, that the very Priests themselves were necessiated to prescribe bounds to what they might possess; They learnt from both, between whom they seemed engrafted, to honour and reve∣rence their Princes: But the Dutch thought the Law ever above them, from which pretence sprung many troubles. The Castilians love to govern, somewhat more strictly than other Nations, and yet what liberty soever they usurp to themselves, they will not allow the like to others: Hence arose very great danger, because as in two divided Empires, neither for Fear or Love to prevent the trouble or win the favour of their Princes, would the Dutch enure any superior, nor the Spaniards an equall. Al People h labour with the thirst and ambition of Rule, if their first actions thrive into a Success, their next Work is to draw the Nations with whom they converse or hold cor∣respondence under the subjection of their Law, to appoint Jug and Governours, to assess and impose Tributes and Taxe, that it may be at their option and pleasure to use and
command the common strength: Thus the Spaniards, accu∣stomed to domineer in Italy, and at their will to lay waste and destroy in America, sought either the same power, or else, for denyall thereof, a cause of Quarrell with the Dutch, who, by a long succession of Princes, were even united in an indisso∣luble league. Neither did Adrian, shortly after Pope, a holy and just man, and yet a Hollander, forget the hateful authority of the Spaniard, the lofty pride of Crojac, and rapacious dealing of Ceury, among whom all things whether temporal∣ly honourable, or Ecclesiastically Sacred, were sold; yet not thinking (though scarcely by force withhel) when they laid down their Command, that they had done ought amiss. Wherefore by soothing up those that were most powerfull, they made a mock of that vain shadow of Empire, where Magistracy must either be by the favour or for the good of the People, & where the Princes can hardly with the most gentle and perswasive blandishments obtain for their most necessary and difficult affairs, an inconsiderable pecuniary ayd. In vain it is, without doubt, to talk of the limit of Dominion be∣yond the Tyrrhene Sea, and utmost extents of the main Ocean; if the subject must become slaves to their Lords at home. Nor yet did they deceive or turn upon those whom their own Country's scarcity, and the known modesty of this Nation had drawn into these Netherlands; Although the Emperour Charles seriously consulted of the alteration of the State, and erecting a Kingdom out of the Cities, especially where the Victory at Pavy had in a manner half brought to pass his de∣sire over Flanders and Artoys, which by that were totally rent from the French possessions, but deterred he was by di∣vers settled Laws and Customs, which he durst not abro∣gate. On the other side, he would not so make the Spanish Pro∣vinces, he himself having often averred, That if their Pride were joyned with the Dutch Patience, they would certainly pro∣duce some eminent mischief: much blaming his Son, who spend∣ing his Youth among the Spaniards, took no notice of the
nature of these people, but rather slighted all conveniencies that were offered him for the survey and knowledg of these Regions. He was indeed an equal Judge of Vertues, and sharer of Honours, behaving himself as one and the same Prince to all his People, not suffering such daily usurpations here, as the Spaniards were free to in their new gained King∣doms, whereat they were troubled; endeavouring to be pre∣sent in these his Netherlands, if his Affairs would bear it, and it hindred not his taking care for his more immediate necessi∣ties. He that was hee the Princes Lieutenant, had a threefold Classis of Counsellors. To the first of whom, was the care and managery of Peace and Warr. To the second, the di∣stribution of Justice according to Law, with the moderation thereof by equity; as also the power of judging and deter∣mining the publick Controversies of those Regions. The third supervised the Treasury, and therein took care of the Prince's Wealth, or to supply his Necessities. That first Councell or Assembly customarily made up of the most noble of the Dutch, and eminent and famous for the many great and weighty Affairs there frequently handled, we will call by a proper name, The Senate; To which Philip between the greatness of his Kingdoms, and the insi∣nuations of such who flattered the actions of his Youth, form∣ing himself to the Spanish Mode, and using no other language, used to come with an assumed austere gravity, few words, and eschewing of much company. And when his Father had withdrawn himself, that he might spend his old age in a pri∣vate retirement they presently urge him to raise new Im∣posts, in whom the old ambition and thirst of Rule, not yet repressed by experiments, was such, as would scarcely suffer either measure or bounds. Nor is it to be doubted, but that most beautiful order of Government gave credit to the faith and vertue of the Spaniards: How great a desire harboured in the Breasts of Princes to subvert the Law, which kept un∣der
the violent ebullitions of their power; the notable ruines both of Princes and People have left us too many both new and old pregnant examples. Of this endeavour and intention of Philip, some of the Spaniards themselves were afterwards sensible, but the Ne∣therlanders (for so for the greater part of them, are they to be called) being now mastered into obedience, but yet not willing to bear an arbitrary Government, though they would seem to bear the yoke the better, from a long use, so that hence were hoped many great and seasonable opportunities against Neighbour Kingdoms both by Sea and Land. Nor was there wanting the seeds of future discord: for when Philip had undertaken the French Warr, invited thereto ra∣ther by their Civill Discords, than the Peoples will or assi∣stance, after many delayes and controvertings, a Tax was granted by the States; but so, as if they had had a power to have denyed it, ordaining, That the very Collectors & Recei∣vers thereof should pay towards the same: This was charged upon them as an unaccustomed thing, and a crime by them committed against their Liberty, which indeed then was but small. Hereupon the meeting of the States being interpreted as a Meeting of confederacy, was strictly forbidden: Nor did the Spaniards doubt to make the offence seem greater, some of them ffecting honour, others minding only rapine, which while the Lawes stood, they knew would not admit them. How necessary it is for wise Princes to keep in pos∣session, since by their presence not only the Netherlands formerly, but even Spain it self, had been kept in good order; yet notwithstanding Phillip is perswaded, the Peace with France being concluded, to take a Journey into Spain, or other parts of his Dominions, as well because he feared some Troubles in that Kingdom, and the encrease of the Turks power at Sea, as also because he should be nearer to take a cae of and secure his American Treasures. At this time also the ancient and magnificent Nobles appeared glorious in
their Dignities, but were mean in their Estates, either by their own Luxury, or the Prince's Policy, who under pre∣tence of Honours, had by extraordinary Charges exhausted every honourable Person. Among all whom, William, by suc∣cession of the Cabellonian Family, Prince of Aurange within a Province of France, did excell the rest in diligence, curtesie and policy; but originally descended from the ancient Fa∣mily of Nassaw in Germany, which formerly having contested with the Austrian Family for the Imperiall Wreath, after∣wards submitted himself under the Patronage of the more fortunate overcomer. He was from his tenderest Infancy separated and taken from his Father, who professed the Ger∣man Religion; he was the Courts softer-Child, and by Charles admitted into his Councells, became not only skilled, and imployed in the conduct of Warre, but in very great Em∣bassies: he was renowned by an antient stock of Nobility, had many large and rich Possessions in the Netherlands, of a great Spirit, which embellished it self, his wisdom and Pru∣dence equalling his height of Spirit, so that he was capable even of the greatest Fortune; cruelty and covetousness were absolute strangers with him: Valiant in the search of the re∣motest matters, and when found a memory so faithful as ever to retain them, by most pleasing allurements growing potent with the People. He had the Government of Holland, Zea∣land and Ʋtrecht, and within those bounds, his care and power managed all the affairs both of Warre and Peace, the Law and the Sword; but Lamoral Count of Egmond, go∣verned Flanders and Artoyes, a man of a more open nature, and like a Souldier, somewhat fierce, trusting much to his wealth and strength, much to his fame; and the truth is, (had he not too much blamed others) in those two famous Victories ob∣tained against the French at St. Quintius and Gravelin, he merited an immortal wreath of Honour and Renown. These two far outwent all the rest, both in the greatness of their charges and honour; for Brabant being a common part
of the Empire, had no proper Governour: the rest of the Provinces are mentioned hereafter. The Command of the Sea, which in it self is most honourable, rested advantaged in Mommorency Count of Horn, sprung from a noble Family in France. These great men thus qualified, the Spaniard found he must remove before he should enjoy the Netherlands, ac∣cording to his aym; and it seemed the more easie to be done, because while they wholly endeavour to attain estimation and Authority, and to that end, cavel at the Spaniards haughtiness and pride, they had already made a breach in friendship: in lie manner, the rest of the Nobles in no manner (though but) comparatively wealthy, made factions, and most of the mea∣ner sort had shipwrack't their credit, either by luxury, or a∣mong a wanting and necessitated Souldiery. In which streights they were not continually thrust out of their power, as their enemies expected, but they used all their industry and diligence, by all wayes and meanes to maintain their dignity: many in these publick distempers, seeking either to hide or amend their own, the vulgar rout were ready for mischief, and would commit spoyls on others, as they were led there∣unto, either by their hope or desperation. These bickerings among the Belgick Peers and Nobility, discording in af∣fection, did in some manner for a while, put a stop to the ca∣reere of the audacious Spaniard, while part take part with the Prince of Aurange, and the others before named, others follow the factions of severall great Houses. But neither the hatted of Warre, the suffering and undergoing its evills, the love of peace, nor the loss of honours, no whit moved the Commons, whose whole study was Merchandizing and feasting; by the first to get money, and by the second, prodigally to spend it: But they took it heavily to heart, that men should be tor∣mented or killed for any manner of worship of God, and this was irksome, even to those that were not within the fear or danger of that cruelty. Long did grief stand wavering be∣tween sighes and teares, before the incitements of good could
make it burst out. Of this matter, because to some it gave cause, to others onely pretence, I will discover it fully from the very beginning. Christian Religion, that of old was reverenced for its naked simplicity, was shortly after set out with the various flourishe of congregated Philosophers, by the additions of each, ac∣cording to their severall fancies, among whom also Jewes, Greeks, and others, cast in the severall Ceremonies of their particular Countries, that so the Majesty of their Religion might the more splendidly appear (nor indeed was it with∣out reason), but these continuing long free to be used or left, at last admitted by the Opinions of some private Families, or the advice and judgment of some Churches, by little and little encreased by use, till the Eloquence of the Learned, and the suffrages and Decrees of Counsels, changed them into necessity and Law: which, through the ignorance of succee∣ding times, and by subtle and dark disputations and circumlo∣quutions, have been ever since defended. In which Interim, the Bishops of Rome, men of an unlimited Authority, emulous Constantinople being removed, as also the Cities of Asia and Aegypt, established a kind of Ecclesiastical Kingdom, where∣in the Cardinalls being as Judges Laterall, they have assumed the height of Empire, and have continued in a long Series of Dominion, none in any manner contradicting them, because most of the European Nations had received their Christianity from instructors sent from Rome. Hence it was that the Rites and Ceremonies of the Latine Church were all received, and the Latine Tongue onely used in all acts of devotion by the Church. But they, after they had thus brought all things Sa∣cred within their own reach, set forth new Decrees, interpret the old, take the holy Scripture out of the hands of the vulgar, protesting it a most pernicious thing, if an unlearned curio∣sity should dive into the understanding of so great a Mystery. Thus turning all things o their own honour and profit, and so great a liberty is given by the Priests, that vice is come to that
pitch, as they themselves confess it wants correcting. But by a sudden breaking forth of Learning, which dispelled, by a new way of preaching, the darkness of that age: there did ap∣pear, some who promised as well to reform Religion as the arts, and to call all things relating to Religion, to the Test of the holy Scripture. This was well pleasing to the People, who weary of the charges and injuries they underwent, did exceedingly re∣joyce, that now they should no longer serve God, and seek for Heaven, with anxious dread, and in blind obedience, but with a more firm and setled confidence, and with fewer Pre∣cepts. Neither were some Princes backward in breaking in upon this Priestly Power, which had now almost subjected unto it self the Kingly Diadem. But here the Proverb was truly manifested, the hand alwayes followes the hurt, certain people of troublesome natures, that could not endure any quiet: what was publickly to be desired, they will though pri∣vate persons, extort, and now they fall together by the ears about the manner, nor will they admit any to compose the differences. But it was no easie matter to pull asunder those joynts which for so many Ages had grown together. And the discomposed face of Affairs was very displeasing, the peoples minds being set a madding, and no apparent way to bring them into order again: for here were revived the opinions of Husse in Germany, of Wicliffe in England, of the Wal∣denses in France, whence by the meetings of their severall Inhabitants by the company of the forreign Souldiers, and by commerce and Trading, they were transpersed over the Netherlands, and grew common. And liberty being allowed of once, changing brought in many impious and nefarious Sects: Nor would any one believe, that here was any Land more fertile in the producing such kinds of Monsters in those times, than the Netherlands, if he should but throughly look over the villanous and reproachful Speeches of David George of Delph, and the seditious sayings of John Bucoldus of Leyden
of these people, but rather slighted all convenience that were offered him for the survey and knowledg of their Regions. He was indeed an equal Judge of Vertues, and shares of Honours, behaving himself as one and the  Prince to all his People not suffering such daily   Spaniards were  to in their  , endeavouring to be pre∣sent in these his Netherlands, if his Affairs would bear it, and is hindred not his taking care for his more immediate . He that was here the Princes Lieutenant, had a  Glass of Counsellors. To the first of whom, was the care and managery of Peace and Warr. To the second, the di∣stribution of Justice according to Law, with the moderation thereof by equity; as also the power of judging and deter∣mining the publick Controversies of those Regions. The third supervised the Treasury, and therein took care of the  Wealth, or to supply his Necessities. That first Councell or Assembly customarily made up of the most noble of the Dutch, and eminent and famous for the many great and weighty Affairs there frequently handled, we will call by a proper name, The Senate; To which Philip between the greatness of his Kingdoms, and the infor∣mations of such who flattered the actions of his Youth, form∣ing himself to the Spanish Mode, and using no other language, used to come with an assumed astere gravity, few words, and eschewing of much company. And when his Father had withdrawn himself, that he might spend his old age in a pri∣vate retirement, they presently urge him to raise new Im∣posts, in whom the old ambition and thirst of Rule, not yet repressed by experiments, was such, as would scarcely suffer either measure or bounds. Nor is it to be doubted, but that most beautiful order of Government gave credit to the faith and vertue of the Spaniards: How great a desire harboured in the Breasts of Princes to subvert the Law, which kept un∣der
the violent abullitions of their power; the notable ruines both of Princes and People have left us too many both new and old pregnant examples. Of this endeavour and intention of Philip, some of the Spaniards themselves were afterwards sensible, but the Ne∣therlanders (for so for the greater part of them, are they to be called) being now mastered into obedience, but yet not willing to bear an arbitrary Government, though they would seem to bear the yoke the better, from a long use, so that hence were hoped many great and seasonable opportunities against Neighbour Kingdome both by Sea and Land. Nor was there wanting the seeds of future discord: for when Philip had undertaken the French Warr, invited thereto ra∣ther by their Civill Discords, than the Peoples will or assi∣stance, after many delayes and controvertings, a Tax was granted by the States; but so, as if they had had a power to have denyed it, ordaining. That the very Collectors & Recei∣vers thereof should pay towards the same: This was charged upon them as an unaccustomed thing, and a crime by them committed against their Liberty, which indeed then was but small. Hereupon the meeting of the States being interpreted as a Meeting of confederacy, was strictly forbidden: Nor did the Spaniards doubt to make the offence seem greater, some of them affecting honour, others minding only rapine, which while the Lawes stood, they knew would not admit them. How necessary it is for wise Princes to keep in pos∣session, since by their presence not only the Netherlands formerly, but even Spain it self, had been kept in good order; yet notwithstanding Phillip is perswaded, the Peace with France being concluded; to take a Journey into Spain, or other parts of his Dominions, as well because he feared some Troubles in that Kingdom, and the encrease of the Turks power at Sea, as also because he should be nearer to take a care of and secure his American Treasures. At this time also the antient and magnificent Nobles appeared glorious in
their Dignities, but were mean in their Estates, either by their own Luxury, or the Prince's Policy, who under pre∣tence of Honours, had by extraordinary Charges exhausted every honourable Person. Among all whom, William, by suc∣cession of the Cabellonian Family, Prince of Aurange within Province of France, did excell the rest in diligence, curtesie and policy▪ but originally descended from the ancient Fa∣mily of Nassau in Germany, which formerly having contested with the Austrian Family for the Imperiall Wreath, after∣wards submitted himself under the Patronage of the more fortunate overcomer. He was from his tenderest Infancy separated and taken from his Father, who professed the Ger∣man Religion; he was the Courts foster-Child, and by Charles admitted into his Councells, became not only skilled, and imployed in the conduct of Warre, but in very great Em∣bassies: he was renowned by an antient stock of Nobility, had many large and rich Possessions in the Netherlands, of a great Spirit, which embellished it self, his wisdom and Pru∣dence equalling his height of Spirit, so that he was capable even of the greatest Fortune; cruelty and covetousness were absolute strangers with him: Valiant in the search of the re∣morest matters, and when found a memory so faithful as ever is retain them, by most pleasing allurements growing potent with the People. He had the Government of Holland, Zea∣land and Ʋtrecht, and within those bounds, his care and power managed all the affairs both of Warre and Peace, the Law and the Sword; but Lamoral Count of Egmond, go∣verned Flanders and Artoyes, a man of a more open nature, and like a Souldier, somewhat fierce, trusting much to his wealth and strength, much to his fame; and the truth is, (had he not too much blamed others) in those two famous Victories ob∣tained against the French at St. Quintius and Gravelin, he merited an immortal wreath of Honour and Renown. These two far outwent all the rest, both in the greatness of their charges and honour; for Brabant being a common part
of the Empire, had no proper Governour: the rest of the Provinces are mentioned hereafter. The Command of the Sea, which in it self is most honourable, rested advantaged in Mommorency Court of Horn, sprung from a noble Family in France. These great men thus qualified, the Spaniard found he must remove before he should enjoy the Netherlands, ac∣cording to his aym and it seemed the more easie to be done, because while they wholly endeavour to attain estimation and Authority, and to that end, cavel at the Spaniards haughtiness and pride, they had already made a breach in friendship: in li manner; the rest of the Nobles in no manner (though but) comparatively wealthy, made factions, and most of the mea∣ner sort had shipwrack't their credit, either by luxury, or a∣mong a wanting and necessitated Souldiery. In which streights they were not continually thrust out of their power, as their enemies expected, but they used all their industry and diligence, by all wayes and meanes to maintain their dignity: many in these publick distempers, seeking either to hide or amend their own, the vulgar tout were ready for mischief, and would commit spoyls on others, as they were led there∣unto, either by their hope or desperation. These bickerings among the Belgick Pees and Nobility, discording in af∣fection, did in some manner, for a while, put a stop to the ca∣reere of the audacious Spaniard, while part take part with the Prince of Aurange, and the others before named, others follow the factions of severall great Houses. But neither the hatred of Warre, the suffering and undergoing its evills, the love of peace, nor the loss of honours, no whit moved the Commons, whose whole study was Merchandizing and feasting; by the first to get money, and by the second, prodigally to spend it: But they took it heavily to heart, that men should be tor∣mented or killed for any manner of worship of God, and this was irksome, even to those that were not within the fear or danger of that cruelty. Long did grief stand wavering be∣tween sighes and teares, before the incitements of good could
it  out. Of this matter, because to some it  , to other onely pretence, I will discover it fully  the very beginning. Christian Religion, that of old was reverenced for its no simplicity, was shortly after set out with the various flourish of congregated Philosophers, by the additions of each, ac∣cording to their severall fancies, among whom also Je Greeks, and others, cast in the severall Ceremonies of the particular Countries, that so the Majesty of their Religion might the more splendidly appear (nor indeed was it with∣out reason), but these continuing long free to be used or  at last admitted by the Opinions of some private Families,  the advice and judgment of some Churches, by little and little encreased by use, till the Eloquence of the Learned and the suffrages and Decrees of Counsels, changed them into necessity and Law: which, through the ignorance of succee∣ding times, and by subtle and dark disputations and circum qutions, have been ever since defended. In which Interi the Bishops of Rome, men of an unlimited Authority, emulo Constantinople being removed, as also the Cities of Asia and Aegypt, established a kind of Ecclesiastical Kingdom, where in the Cardinalls being as Judges Laterall, they have assume the height of Empire, and have continued in a long Series of Dominion, none in any manner contradicting them, because most of the European Nations had received their Christianity from instructors sent from Rome. Hence it was, that the Ri and Ceremonies of the Latine Church were all received, and the Latine Tongue onely used in all acts of devotion by the Church  they, after they had thus brought all things Sa∣cred  their own reach, set forth new Decrees, interp the old, take the holy Scripture out of the hands of the vulga protesting it a most pcious thing, if an unlearned curio∣sity should dive into the understanding of so great a Mystery. Thus turning all things to their own honour and profit, and so great a liberty is given by the Priests, that vice is come to the
pitch, as they themselves confess it wants correcting. But by a sudden breaking forth of Learning, which dispelled, by a new way of preaching, the darkness of that age: there did ap∣pear, some who promised as well to reform Religion as the , and to call all things relating to Religion, to the Test of the holy Scripture. This was well pleasing to the People, who weary of the charges and injuries they underwent, did exceedingly re∣joyce, that now they should no longer serve God, and seek for Heaven, with anxious dread, and in blind obedience, but with a more firm and setled confidence, and with fewer Pre∣cepts. Neither were some Princes backward in breaking in upon this Priestly Power, which had now almost subjected unto it self the Kingly Diadem. But here the Proverb was truly manifested, the hand alwayes followes the hurt, certain people of troublesome natures, that could not endure any quiet: what was publickly to be desired, they will, though pri∣vate persons, extort, and now they fall together by the ears about the manner, nor will they admit any to compose the differences. But it was no easie matter to pull asunder those joynts which for so many Ages had grown together. And the discomposed face of Affairs was very displeasing, the peoples minds being set a mading, and no apparent way to bring them into order again: for here were revived the opinions of Husse in Germany, of Wicliffe in England, of the Wal∣denses in France, whence by the meeting  their severall inhabitants, by the company of the forreig  diers, and by commerce and Trading, they were transpersed over the Netherlands, and grew common. And liberty being allowed of once, changing brought in many impious and nefarious Sects: Nor would any one believe, that there was any Land more fertile in the producing such kinds of Monsters in those times, than the Netherlands, if he should but throughly look over the villanous and reproachful Speeches of David George of Delph, and the seditious sayings of John Bucoldus of Loydem
against Christ: Both which being Hollanders, the one being a Painter of Glass, by counterfeiting divine inspirations,  more than an ordinary living, and begot a Sect to survive him. The other, a kind of a Taylor, who began a Warre, and also to set up a Kingdom at Muister, but both with unlucky (though deserved) event. I have observed the wisest of Princes, to have endeavou∣red remedies, by way of prevention, against these contraries in Religion, in regard of the greatness of the error, and the multitude of the errings; As when there hath been equall power, sometimes two of a Sect have been brought forth into publick, under strict custody of the Law, that they might not by that pretence make a disturbance. Another time, when the Emperour and his Councel have, upon heating, found cause to condemn any, such have been excommunicate, and thrown out of the Church. And if there were any more haynous mistrust lay upon them, then were they also debared from private meetings: But we may not utterly condemn those, who punished such as held forth Do∣ctrines obnoxious, and dissonant to good manners, either by banishment, or Sequestration of their Honours and Estates: But that Judgment belonged to the Magistrate, who, by such punishments, cannot be said to revenge their own injuries. It is granted, that Priests may correct those that deviate through ignorance, & to keep them from participating of the Sacred Mysteries; and then too, there was a lawful course used for discovery therof, facts were punished, thoughts went free; but to rage and tyranize over the lives of those, who have neither forfeited their faith to God nor their Princes, seems barbarously inhumane in Bishops, and not altogether safe for Princes themselves. But the Roman Bishops, crept on by little and little, to that heighth, that they strengthned that Law by terror, which was obtained by subtlety, which secular Princes, favouring too much their greatness, made sharp and rigorous as against Traytors; for nothing would satisfie them, but to
have as sharp Laws against such as usurped at their Decrees, as if they had Rebelled against God himself by Blasphemy. Nor was it onely enjoyned to Bishops, to visit their Dio∣cesses; but also they were wont, when they thought it meet, to send Inquisitors, with a most ample Power, (which first began about Four Hundred Years since) and these chose to be assistant unto whom they pleased; who had Autho∣rity to examine upon Oath any person whatsoever, whereso∣ever, or under whose Obedience soever he lived: And by these subtle Dealings, they not onely did wind themselves into the Secrets of Families, but dived into the Closet of Mens Hearts; for as any one was more or less Conscienti∣ously fearful of Perjury, so did he accordingly, more or less, by closer or more open Discoveries, betray himself. But if this were not, yet were it a hard matter for men to conceal themselves there, where it is accounted Religion to fall down before the Shrines of Saints, their Host exposed in the Churches, or else when it is openly carryed about. Suspi∣cion sends a man to Prison; but the meanest Discovery is enough to commit him to Torture. Nor is it permitted, for the Accused Person, Guiltless or Guilty, to hear or re∣fute the Witness; as if such Allowance would be danger∣ous to the Witnesses, and destructive to Truth it self. The Temporal Judges are commanded to punish all that are con∣demned, although it onely proceed from Ecclesiastical Cen∣ure, in the cruel executing whereof, many strive to shew their Zeal and Piety: Others there were, who did foresee these manner of Judgments, to be subject not onely to Scandal and Hatred, but Covetousness; because when Goods happened not to be Confiscate, they would not suffer them to be taken out of their Cognizance and Power, to the use of the Parties, untill they had satisfied the Charge of the Complaint: But the Spanish Inquisition, for Sharpness and Cruelty, exceeds all other; for the management whereof, some Monks, of the Order of St. Dominike are chosen; and
it was of old, and originally, instituted against the Jews and Moors; who being, by their Kings, compelled to own and profess Christianity, did yet clandestinely relapse into the abjd Errours. This, at first, was, not unworthily, made use of against those Barbarous Nations, though with their Hatred; but af∣terwards it was by a wondrous Sagacity of Inquiry, laid pre∣miscuously as a Burden upon all. For the most wary spee∣ches, nay, silence it self, Decoles and Treacheries in Friend∣ship; nay, sideling and oblique Accusations were admitted so that it was plainly evident, no man could behave himself with Innocency, as could preserve his Safety and Honour, if they were minded to question it; which makes me think that they are not to be mistrusted for Forging, who say onely the real Truth, not out of Envy, that they have heard in Spain it self, and almost all over Italy, most grievous Complaint of this Inquisition, made by Romanists themselves in the very City of Rome. In the Netherlands, the Emperour Charles first set out a Edict concerning Religion, after he had condemned Luther upon a full Hearing before the Synod of Wormes in Germany and here it began from pecuniary Mults, and other Corpo∣real Sufferings, to punish with Death; and by reason of the Lenity of the Judges, the laws were site ched, and seve times proclaimed. There was likewise great Care taken that no Books should be published, but what had the Appro∣bation of the Doctors of Lonvayne: They who would Preach, or argue out of the Scriptures, were fain to meet  private Assemblies; Death, by the Sword, was threat unto Men, and to Women Inhumation, or Burial alive, toge∣ther with the Confiscation of their Goods: yet so, that the ight first come in, and acknowledge their Errour, for the Obstinate were to be burned. Also, if any detected   false Opinions, and innocent in the rest; wo repeat, he should be degraded from all his Dignities: They
who harboured such, and did not bring them forth, should be lyable to the same punishments, as the guilty themselves, but Rewards and Impurity to all Accusess. Many severe Edicts were set forth against suspected Persons, and such as fled, but most terrible against Relapsers: And the very Judges, though terrified by Penalties, yet, least, under the pretence of Pitty, they should moderate the Laws, had In∣quisitors, fully instructed by Caesar himself joyned to them; Onely the City of Antwerp, whom a moderate Liberty, toge∣ther with extraordinary Obedience had mightily enriched, daring to complain to the Germans and English, that the Se∣verity of that Edict, had driven away the best part of her Commerce, obtained, that Strangers should be a little more kindly used; and that, that part of the Decree whereby Alie∣nations, and Testaments of Delinquents, even before Judgment, should be rescinded, (an evident Ruine of all Merchandi∣sing) should not in that City be of any force: These Laws being Dictated by a Disposition, or Nature, in it self other∣wise not at all cruel, we may the less wonder, that the strength of Religion made them, being impatient of any Dissentors; which, as in it self, should rather mollifie and unite mens minds, yet is, by the wickedness of Humane Frailty, made the main Cause of most bitter Discords and Factions: Most of the Princes made it their Business, to bind up the United Body of the Commonwealth in one Religion, as in one Heart, and to be as well fixt, and well satisfied in the Reason of Sa∣cred, and of Profane Laws; which might, certainly, if they were not so commonly admitted to vulgar handling: whereby Caesar also was the more easily perswaded, after the German Method, that they might not with the Despised Reverence of the Clergy, cast off the Bond of their Obedience to him, by some few Penalties, to take away the strength of that Poy∣son, which had its only Aliment from Liberty. But the Event proved quite contrary, for though many suffered and pe∣rished, by putting this in effect; yet instead of a Decrease
from thence, they infinitely multiplyed; and the Reason hereof might be, because those things which we corporally act onely, by the Fear and Threatning of Death and Tor∣ments, are obnoxious to Authority and Power: But the Mind, as it is free, and not to be limited or bound up, if it receive any Principles or Documents into it self, it will not be evinced either by Fire or Sword, but rather incites and scores danger, accounting it a Blessed and Glorious thing, to suffer. Ignominies and Cruelty, not being Conscious to themselves of having committed Evil, which they learnt not onely from the Primitive Christians, but many Examples of these very Times. For after the Butchery of no less than One Hundred Thousand Men, to make a Triall if this Fire were to be quenched with Bloud, such vast Multitudes made In∣surrections all over the Netherlands, that sometimes the pub∣like Executions, especially if upon any more eminent Cri∣minal or Exemplary Torments, were hindred and impeded by Seditions. And this moved the Queen of Hungary, that had the Government of these Netherlands, under her Bro∣ther Charles, to go to him while he yet staid in Germany, and to let him know, how great a slaughter those things, which were pretended for Remedies, had made. But Philip, not at all moved or frighted with these things, did more earnestly press what his Father had begun, by sharp and threatning Edicts, and preparing other Remedies, which might repress this Evil now getting Age: The Cause, above all others, and which we may with most Reason conjecture, was the Pope's Authority, by which he had ordered many of these things to be done; For having obtained, by the gene∣ral Consent of so many Nations, to Distribute of Kingdoms, and to be a Moderator, and Judge of Law, Equity and Right, while he by submissive Obedience, and large Gifts, was made their Friend and Ally, they might confidently rest assured, in the Success of their Affairs, which he had throughly learned by his Fathers, and his own Experiments,
How terrible it was, and injurious to his, Affairs, to have that Power adverse to him, from which, even they who had Con∣quered it in War, were glad to crave a Pardon: These were the state of Affairs, and these the Conditions of the People, when, upon the Departure of King Philip, strife began about the Chief Government. In the attaining whereof, both the Prince of Aurange, and Count Egmond, had pitched their Hopes and Expectancie; but neither of them had it, for this Reason, least either of them singly being preferr'd, should, by perpetual private Feudes, disturb the Peace of the Common∣wealth. There was likewise Ambitions of the same sort among Women, to wit, Christian that had marryed Francis Duke of Lorrain, Uncle of the Emperour Charles and Margaret, base Daughter of the said Charles, first marryed to Alexander Medices, afterwards to Octavius Farnese Duke of Parma. The Prince of Aurange, and the Netherlanders, endeavoured by all means to promote Christian: but Ferdinande Alvares of Toledo, Duke of Alva, and Anthony Perenot Granvell Bishop of Artoyes, having been jointly Servants and Coun∣sellors to his Father in his greatest Affairs, and by Philip re∣ceived with the like Honour, were of a contrary Opinion, for Margaret. Alva, one of the greatest and noblest Spani∣ards, in many places esteemed a great and famous Souldier, by the getting some notable Victories for the Emperour, had won great Renown: Perenottes Father, one Nicholas a Bur∣gundian, as he was of a mean Stock, so he was more readily obsequious, and by his extraordinary Watchfulness and In∣dustry, so acquired the Humour of the Court, that he became a Privy Counsellour, and had the keeping of the Emperours Seal; in which, having performed his Duty, by the space of Twenty Years, he at last left the same to the enjoyment of his Son. But as Alva's proud and cruel Nature, so Perenottes subtle Disposition, while they onely seek to inlarge the Grandezza
of the Prince, who likewise desired nothing so much, they do both of them find fault with as many Nations as they knew, especially the Germans; who imputing the Landgrave's Imprisonment, to no other than their Counsels, did esteem and reckon their too great Power, among the principal Cau∣ses of the War. Again, when it came to the Point of giving the Government of the Netherlands to Margaret, although there wanted not specious Causes enough for the giving of that Counsel, as such a Tye of Bloud, and that her Husband would be a Pledge for her Fidelity, and her Person be in the Command of the Spaniards, both in the City and Castle: Yet the departure of the King, no less suspected by the Great Ones, than bewailed by the meaner sort inflamed the angry Minds of the Nobles. And that very Day was the chief, in which Philip was sollicited for Liberty, and that the Nether∣landers shewed themselves contumacious or sawcie towards their Prince: For just upon his Departure, resolving to leave a Garrison of above Three Thousand Spaniards, under pre∣tence of defending the Borders against the French; but, in truth, that he might, at his pleasure, bridle the Licentiousness in Religion, which had been increased by a Company of Forraign Souldiers in the Wars: The Prince of Aurange, and Count Egmond, whom he appointed Commanders of those Forces, on purpose to asswage their Envy, refused the Charge as being contrary to their Laws: and at the very instant of the Kings going away, the Assembly of the States, whom he had onely called together; to give a Farewel to, asked him, That he wou'd remove away with him those Souldiers, when they would not endure; adding also, a Warning, or Monition, That he should use the Counsell of none but Netherlanders, in the Go∣vernment of the Netherlands. And from hence, there sprung an implacable Hatred, because they seemed to give out, as if they understood the Art of Governing, and fore-saw the approaching Tyranny. But openly He agreed to their Re∣quest, and thereupon forbore to adde Gemessa Figueroa
Spaniard, and Earl of Feria, unto that Great Councel, though lately destined to that Intent. But in this Dissimu∣lation, he nourished Anger in his Heart, and in his Mind stu∣died nothing but Revenge: So departing, but disdaining to pass the Borders of Strangers, he went by Sea, where in the Shipwrack of his Fleet, through many great and immi∣nent Dangers, with much ado he got safe to the Port of Gal∣licia. The Souldiery for a little while after remained there, but very unruly and burdensom, untill at Gerbis, or the Island of Gelues, (called by the Antients Meninx) having received a loss by the Turks, they were taken from them (as the Ne∣therlanders interpreted it) not so in favour of them, as to supply the Loss there received. In the mean while, the Government of the Netherlands. Nominally was in Marga∣ret, but in Deed and Power in Granuel; in whom, Industry, Vigilance, Ambition, Luxury, Covetousness, and, in truth, all manner both of Good and Evil, were eminently to be seen. Nor did he advantage himself more by his own Prudence, than by the Folly and Sloth of Others; who growing weak by Riot, had let slip those Opportunities of present Power, which, of old, was not without great difficulty and hazard to be attained. He therefore minding cunningly, to oblige his Prince, by diving into Secrets, and by advancing his Fol∣lowers, contracted unto himself, the Intriques of all Embassies, and all sorts of Characters, and what ever else was to be known, either by Spies, or Pensioners. Between this Grandee, and Count Horn, there were some old Gudges; first, concerning Lalayn. Count Horn's Sisters Husband, whom he taxed with the Crime of an ill performed Embassie; Another was, that Horn had missed the Praefectureship, or Lieutenancy of Gelderland, (which he had much sought after) for want onely of one word's speak∣ing of his.
He had not yet Declared himself to the Prince of Au∣range, the onely hope of increasing his Dignities resting up∣on him; but, as the Custom of Ambition is, had hitherto onely looked upon him with an evil Eye, least he should grow too great for him: For which cause when Magistrates were to be chosen at Antwerp, he had endeavoured to pro∣cure him to be absent: But the Prince of Aurange, who above all things, the empty Boast or bare Title of Honour, and that one Man, a stranger, and of men Extract, should possess what he listed, not without the disgrace both of him∣self and others, stirred up with many provocations Count Egmond, who then by chance had observed himself to have received some Injuries from Granuel in assuming to himself, and not bestowing the Governorship of Hsdin, and the Ab∣bacy of Trully, which Egmond had desired for his Kinsman, and by him was denied: Hereupon, many of the Compa∣nions of the Order of the Golden Fleece, (for at this time they were often called to meet together by Margaret, that they might Consult about Defending and Fortifying the Borders, drew their Collegues into Parties, as if these Managements of Affairs tended wholly to all their Disparagements, by whose Counsels formerly the Princes Business had so well succeeded: After which, these Three Noble-men, to shun any further Converse with Anthony Granuel, whereas they used to sit together in the Senate, publikely sell out with him. Antony seeing this, began to bestir himself, to be able to re∣sist those men, who were not onely powerful in themselves, but strengthned by the Love and Favour of the People: To which purpose, he drew to his Side, by Benefits and Favours, Men active and ingenuous; among whom, were Charles Bar∣lamont, and Viglius Zuichm, which were also of the same Senate, He being the Chief of the Treasury. This, though not of any great Family, yet famous for his Understanding, and Knowledge of Affairs, was the Chief of the Judges of the Law, who by their secret Meetings, and private Conferen∣ces,
concerning unknown matters, made such an exulcerated Odium appear against them, as became the publick sign and token of faction. Now Philip, before his departure, that he might the better settle affairs of Religion, had obtained from Paul the fourth then Pope, that all His Provinces of the Netherlands, should be exempt from the care and charge of forraign Bishops. For the Archbishops of Colen and Rhomes, which were, of old, chief Cities, that of Lower Germany, this of Gallia Belgica, had nothing now left them of that so antique division besides the name. Their Jurisdiction therefore being taken away, together with the Bishops of Leige, Triers, Oiuburgh, Mun∣ster, and Paterborgh, losing also part of their Command, and three Bishops in upper Burgundy, to wit of Mechlin, Utrecht, and Cambray, renounced, and under these many more, of whom in the Borders of Brabant, Antwerp, and Senlis: of Gelderland, Rurimunde: of Flanders, Gaunt, Ipro, and Bruges: of Holland, Harlem: of Zeland, Middleburgh: of Overissel, Daventry: of Artoyes also with Audornarum: thence Na∣mur, Groining and Torney, Cities that bear the names of the Countries they stand in. This was an antient Custom, and much used by the Popes, upon the multiplying of people, and that Religion might be the more easily taken care of, to erect new Bishops Seas, so to share among many the burden which grew too great for one, and the Emperour Charles minding other things, had omitted this care which of old was taken by the Princes of the Austrian Family. But the causes of the reviving this Policy or appointment were hated and grown odious almost to all. One was, that they who should overlook and inquire into the manners of the Clergy, and the peoples errors, might be more in number and neerer, and this the very Authours thereof openly professed, complaining that vices did mightily increase by the neglect or connivence of those who should take care to prevent the same.
Another was imputed to Granvell's cunning, who had take from Rome, both the Bishoprick of Mechlin, and the Digni∣ty of a Cardinall, most men guessing in the future, that would be as when Priests of old had by Prerogative a right  suffrage in the Assembly of the States, that he being the chi of that number, with others which he should, by his mea and endeavours, allure (for the right of naming Bishops w by the Popes granted to the King, reserving to themselves onely the right of approbation) might, by an under-hand con∣federacy with the Spaniards, suppress their liberty. When Revenues were to have been setled upon Bishops, out of Monasticall Possessions, the Abbots were the first that gain sayed that purpose, of which society, at that time, all, with free and unanimous consent, avowed, they would not admit underminers of their Wealth and Authority: The Brabander confederates with these, by Books, commend the care of the Laws to the Prince, wherein they advise, that Ecclesiastical Promotions should not be increased without the consent of the Nobility and Commons; Hereto we e added many an∣swers of men professing Justice, That it was an act of irre∣ligion and profaneness to tear away the pious and charitable liberalities of other men, and to question the judgements and integrity of dying persons, by diverting their gifts to other uses than they intended them. And some of the ancient Bi∣shops, especially He of Leige, cryed out, the Pope was cir∣cumvented, and with all eagerness prosecuted their right. Hereupon many other Cities refused to receive their new Bi∣shops, and who were admitted, were so generally hated, that they could never officiate without mocks and taunts. Now the Nobles taking notice of the generall hate of the Nether∣landers against Granvell, did think it most necessary, for the better managing of their publick affairs; That there should be a generall Assembly of the State: Therefore as often as there hapned complaints of the poverty of their Treasury, or of the fear of Seditions (for there was much pay behind, and
due to the Souldier both Horse and Foot, and Merchants be∣gan to be restrained among Forreigners for publick debts, and the Tributes promised for nine years were even now at an end.) They began to cry up the old Custom, of which (they said) good Princes would never think amiss. What marvel is it now, that all things were in a deplora∣ble Condition, when, in all their evills, the basest flattery could rob them of their onely remedy. The adverse party took notice of all, to little purpose, therefore it was for them to dissemble how far their malice tended, in prosecuting, with hatred, the man that had been industrious for the King, more than they would have had; and therefore, the Ministers of State, under Philip, were to inquire out any that were emulous of the Princes Power, and who those should be, to whom all would submit in this great alteration, the Abbots were trou∣bled for their own private lucre sake. The Nobility were ob∣noxious to these; and the rest, under the notion of the States, were doubtfull, and in suspence, for the use of their temporal usages. So that dissembling here modesty and obedience, their fore-sight of, and providing against dangers, and the Lawes left to them by their Ancestors, and vertuous Discour∣ses, every one did strive to make himself greatest; Further∣more, those three before named, taking the boldness to write Letters to the King, denyed it possible to divert the publick ruine of the State, unless Perenotte were removed from his abominated Power, praying also for themselves, an exempti∣on from the Assembly of States: but promising very largely, as to his Government, his Sisters Dignity, and the mainte∣nance of the Roman Religion. Philip sends them an answer, full of courteous Language, wherein he said, that he did not use to set aside Ministers of State, without hearing and perpending their cause of Com∣plaint; but if he could not have his Revenue, upon whose payment he did depend, he would that some of them should come to him, from whom, being present, he would take cog∣nizance
of the whole matter. They earnestly write back a∣gain, That it was not for them to lay crimes to any ones charge but they believed it was a part of his duty, rightly and truly  have informed his Prince, but whether he had so done or not, the imminent danger, if they should be silent, would speak; and they hoped, that their Births and Merits would gain no lesse credit  their betters, than their words; but now chiefty, when the absen of Governours from their Charges could not be well admitted. The King was much moved at these lines, but finding necessary a little to yield, he sends secretly to Grannell (whom now these fore-going passages began to vex, partly a a by-stander, and partly as being guilty to himself of the deadly hatred of the people towards him) commanding him to depart into Burgundy, whither he was ordered to retire for avoyding the danger of his life so much fought and layd wait for by his enemies. And a long time after, he kept all the Netherlands, or the greatest part, in fear of his return, but few joyning with him in his hopes, till at length, either by Command, or his own free will, he went to Rome. There they who hitherto had been kept out of office, were, at the Request of the Regent Margaret, recalled in the Senate of Assembly, and that they might give some proofs of them∣selves, they begin with all diligence to advise and take no∣tice of choice things; of others there was no great need. And the praise and thanks of dissembling their Crimes, was so much the greater towards them, by how much he would divert them from the sense of their evill, so that now, acting wholly as Victors, they had taken all things into their own hands, whether belonging to publick accounts, or to the Law, saying, it was the Soveraign pleasure of the Senate, and that to it all the other Assemblies ought their Service and Obedience. But how many faults do attend where some few bear the Sway, and in how little time do they grow ripe? The Kings Revenew neglected, the Authority of the Law among po∣tent
discords laid aside, the greatest Crimes and villanies unpunished, Honours given for favour, either much done through ambition, by such as coveted the praise of all, or else evils, never to be remedied, overcharge the Credit of the great ones; They dissembled less in point of Religion, main∣taining it was better taught by perswasion than compulsion, till at length they found, what they supposed as remedies, proved rather food to nourish the Disease: But when they granted this in favour of the People, whether it were out of their own disposition averse from cruelty, or that they suspe∣cted under the veil of the Inquisition, that there lay hid sla∣very or danger to the valiantest men, I will not undertake to discover: But this is most evident, that they themselves did not depart from the Ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and he who was the chief in all these Consultations, in his own Principality of Aurange, would suffer nothing in matters of Religion to be changed. Besides this, and for other weighty Causes, Egmond was sent into Spain, to pry into the Kings nature and affections, and is there received with so much Honour, and such high Gifts, as no man before him ever had the like. Here Philip protests much of affection to the Netherlan∣ders, and that he may prevent any desire of his return to them again, he sayes, he hath resolved in himself for the Turkish Warre, and likewise gave him some hope, that he would moderate the rigour of the Sentence, and Edict of the Bishops; least either by severity or impunity, he might pro∣voke the Secturies licentiousness, whereas in truth he intend∣ed to make it far more strict: For when first he came into Spain, and found there many, and some of the chief, of the Covent of St. Isidore, to think otherwise than they ought of the received Rites and Doctrine, he was not onely content to have commanded into the fire, Learned men and noble Women, but rejoyced to see the same; with the terrour whereof, having appeased the discords there, he believed
either the sloth or timidity of his Judges hindred, if not en∣vyed him the like success in the Netherlands; And at this time Elizabeth his Wife, Sister of Charles King of France being sent, together with the Duke of Alva, to ajon, whe∣ther the same Charles and his Mother Medicos, met at a Con∣ference, for rooting out innovators and disturbers of Religi∣on, he bound himself by some private Covenants, to be as∣sistant equally therein: The like League was made between Henry and Philip, after the Peace of Cambray, and this being by the imprudence of Henry, discovered to the Prince of Orenge in his Embassy into France, as he was by chance  hunting, made him often assert with Protestations, that he onely feared those Counsels which were concealed, Egmond was scarce returned, full of his vain hope, but the Kings Letters immediately followed, cruelly commanding the Inquisitors to execute judgement upon violators, and no∣velties in Religion, adding certain other Assistants to the number of the Judges; and though Viglius, and many with him, perswaded the contrary, presently they were published, to the great trouble of all mens mindes, and shortly after, were the Decrees of the Councel of Trent put forth: by whom nothing being amended, either in Doctrine or Cere∣monies, some whole Nations separated and fell off from the Church of Rome; onely there was a Decree made for re∣formation of Priests Lives and Manners, wherewith indeed they were offended, but never cured. And truly in the Ne∣therlands, those mens lives were most vicious, who being ad∣mitted into the Sacred Order of Priesthood, got nothing thereby but the name and Revenues, yet were these men most fierce for the publishing of these Decrees, which in some places were obeyed, but with exception underwritten to which Philip had consented, that they should not derogate from any mans right, which was added, by reason of Patrona∣ges of Churches, and bounds of Jurisdictions.
But the Brabanders, with one free consent, went further: First, their Cities, and afterwards the Senate or States of their Nation, did Declare, That this Custome of the Inquisi∣tion, insensibly creeping in daily in a high manner into their Coun∣tries, was against the Law, by which all their Judgments should be directed, and which should set Bounds to the Priesthood wherein they should walk. The Constancy of these, was followed by others; but especially the Common People were infinitely perplexed, with the Terrible Rumour of the Spanish Inquisi∣tion, whose Authority with the King, though manifest, and its Usage and Example in all Kingdoms how profitable, and though commended by the French, yet the Name of it in the Netherlands, with great Regret of Spirit, was abominated: There were, who at this time wrote to the King, the whole Sum of this Discipline, which he, under the Name of Here∣sie, gave hearing to, with an evil Will, least he should in any manner give Credit, to a thing so profane and detest∣able, however glosed over by those malitious People. Here, by the Industry of the Prince of Aurange, were excited George Cassander, and Francis Balduin of Artoyes, Men well skilled in Antiquity, and that perswaded to Moderation: There is of this Mans extant, an eloquent Oration, desiring the free use of that Religion, who now, by being grown strong, could not be esteemed a Disturber of the Peace, with whose Interest such a Liberty would be consistent, as well as with that of Commerce: The Pope having, in these inferior things, to the very Jews given leave to purchase Impunity, for the Exercise of their Religious Rites: But all these things pro∣ving of no effect, some for fear of punishment, others desi∣rous of novelty, cast out ambiguous and doubtful Speeches, send abroad Libels, the onely Allurements of the Vulgar; and, as a thing indifferent, there being no War to retain the Assertors of the German Religion: The Romane Superstition is again thrown out of England; as also, by the Danes and Swedes: Nor in France do Slaughters pass unrevenged,
where not being able to bear the cruel Natures of those who Tyrannized over them, they Resolved openly, to defen their Safety, either by Peace or Warre, there being no other Mediums for their Liberty: For certainly, there is nothing can more strictly oblige the People to their Duty, than the Prince to a moderate and just Government. By making use of these Alterations, the Minds of the No∣bles were confirmed, who already judged themselves in their own Thoughts, to stand condemned in the Kings; and some of them being married to Women, that were Forraigners well by Countrey, as by Religion; as the Prince of Aurange to a Saxon, and Count Horn to a Nionarian, gave the Cr∣dulous King also from thence also cause of Suspition, which they were not insensible of; because the King had already shewed his Dislike, against the new power of the Senat which they had introduced and assumed. And therefore that they might the better strengthen their Cause, by the As∣sistance of the Vulgar, they endeavour to quiet Religion and if they cannot firm a publike Peace, at least to settle Domestike One, they making the fear of the ensuing Mis∣chiefs so much the greater, by how much the rest did under valuingly sleight them, they endeavour to hide these Practi∣ces, under the Notion of Civil Disturbances, which they also themselves were partly the cause of; or else by these means they hoped to move the King: however, they doubted not in these Novelties of Assistance, if not out of Love to them yet out of Envy to the Spanish Greatness. Departing there∣fore from the Senate, as if they had fore-seen Commotions, which they were unable to help, now under pretence of So∣lemnizing Marriages; another time, intermingling Festiv Societies, to make them seem the more solemn, they gather∣ed together, and obliged to them many, either by the Ties of Bloud, or the Obligations of Friendship. But long it was not, ere the main matter, at which all these things aimed, burst out; for after it was perceived, that there were many
which looked that way, while they sollicite much both the Commander and Souldier, find fault that a Woman should be chief in Authority, disswade the States and Governours of Cities from Cruelty, and to suffer patiently. Many other Noble men, but all wi  any Government or Command, among whom were some of the Romane Religion, made a , which was drawn up by one Marnye, against the In∣sition, wherein they promised to aid and assist one another,  any of them should thereby be questioned, or brought into nger; And that it might not be unknown upon what main strength they relyed, among the Leaders of that Faction, the most eminent was Lewis of Nassau, Brother to the Prince of Aurange, an open Dissentor from the Romane Profession. So  now it was no difficult matter to understand, that al∣though the reall and greatest Heads of the Faction, did not yet appear, yet to judge who they were, that, when time should serve, would uphold them, whose Interest and Autho∣rity, in the mean while, was a sure Safeguard to all Preten∣ders for the rest, against the bitter Invectives and Tyranny of hose, who by Arms would endeavour to stifle or suppress this growing Rebellion. There joyned with the before-named Lewis, the Counts of Herenburgh, and Culemburgh, and Henry Brederode, of an ntient Family of the greatest Nobility of Holland, and ge∣nerally beloved of the People, whose hopes were blown up too high, and were vain and incertain, unless more had ap∣peared. These, accompanied with Four Hundred Confederates, the fifth Day of April, 1566. came all unarmed to the Court of ruxels, where then the Prince of Aurange, & the rest, scarce∣ly intreated by the Lady Margaret the Regent, to return hither, had taken their Places and were sitting: These were their Desires (for so they called them) That the King's Edicts concerning Religion, might, by the Order of the States of the Netherlands, be changed, and that they would acquiesce till it,
could be done. The one of which, when the Regent promise she would recommend to the King, and protested the other not in her power; they urged the same with an earnestne rather befitting Judges or Justices who had power of Com∣mand, than Petitioners, who knew to  rate their Zeal w Temperance. Then first was heard of that name of Guise, ∣terwards no less famous than those of Protestants and H∣gonets, when therefore some had cast into the Teeth of the Confederates, their broken and decaid Fortunes, they not the king notice of the happy Fortune of that Name, but whol∣led by Honour, confirmed their Faith to the King, to sta by him, even to the hazard of their Estates: Which thing being now evident to the whole World, there were various Consultations both in Spain and the Netherlands: Of the who were attendant upon the Councels and Person of t Lady Margaret, some reputed those Requests, or rather De∣mands of the Confederate Nobles, to be just: Others thought them onely necessary: But some of the Great Ones, who be∣gan to suspect the Cruelty of the King's Intentions toward them, without any Dissembling, demanded Pledges for the Security, and to prevent the fear of suffering punishment which otherwise might happen to be the cause of a War and if these things were denied, they having under the Commands most valiant People of several Nations, a likewise some Troops of Natives, which would prove the main Props of the War, would not draw a Sword in Defend of those Laws, by which the Citizens being slain by each o∣thers hand, should fall onely for the pleasure and advantage of the Spaniards. After many several Letters sent to the King, at last John Montigniac the Brother of Count Horn, and John Marquess of Berghen op Zome, glad of the Honour of their Embassie, that they might clear themselves of the former, and take them∣selves off from the future Troubles, came to him; who, trou∣bled every day with fresh Messengers, and bad News, di
often advise with the chief of those Spaniards, who had been in the Netherlands, and of the Senate there, what was best to be done. The Form of Laws (wherein was contained, that Mi∣nisters teaching Heretical Doctrine, Receivers and Abettora of Conventicles, and such as by their evil Examples, had done great harm to the Publike, should suffer Death, either by the Halter or Sword, and the rest either abjure their Errours, or fly▪) of which, amendment and moderation was desired, and transmitted from the States, was altogether unpleasing, be∣cause he was more careful of his own Dignity, than fearful of any Danger, in that he would not seem to be compelled by Threatnings, to grant such things as were contrary to his Nature and Will: But hitherto he seemed to bear there∣with, that the Authority of the Bishops might be well set∣led, whose Duty it was, if any Trouble should happen, dili∣gently to take care to prevent the same; otherwise, by the Pope's express Command, they were not, without Order, to meddle further. He refused to grant any Pardon, without Examination of the Cause; and unless he might with more Severity, take notice of the Confederacy, than those times would bear, though formerly he would willingly have grant∣ed them more; yet he promised they should partake both of his Presence and Climency: But to call a General Meet∣ing of the States, though the Cities most faithful and Loyal to him desired, the whole Netherlanders perswaded, his Sister urged, and without which it was almost impossible for him to keep his Government there, he most obstinately denied, rather commanding them to take Arms; and the easier and more readily to raise an Army, to take the Germans into pre∣sent Pay. Adding moreover, That he doubted not, but th as his Father had often had Experience of the Fidelity of the Dutch Nobles, so he should likewise find them ready and obedient to him, desiring onely to put in Execution, the Laws made by his Father: For though any man may dissent in O∣pinion,
yet still the Decision and Judgment thereof is left to the Prince, and Obedience onely to the Subjects. But o the contrary, they had so brought it about, that no Force could be raised, by laying open the Poverty of the Treasu∣ries; and if there were any gotten together, the Confederate Noble-man anticipated the same; giving out also, that For∣reign Souldiers on all hands offered to serve under them Which Rumour, as it was spread to terrifie the other Party so was it altogether dissonant to the Truth. For they re∣check the Haughty and Tyrannical Humour of Philip, boast∣ed, that they had both the Strength and Wealth of some of their Neighbors, who, either in Point of Religion, were of the same Mind with them, or very little differing, to ass them, by which means they proceeded at Home, both with greater Surety and Safety. Now of those who denied the Authority of the Pope, there were three sorts in the Netherlands; the Anabaptists, whereof many were in Frizeland, and the Neighbouring Parts, were not greatly to be feared, by reason of their rash∣ness, and infinite Disorders amongst themselves; as also, be∣cause they did renounce both Magistracy and Arms: But that Profession, which received its Name from Luther, and the Augustane Synod, was maintained and upheld by the  king and favour of many of the German Princes, and a certain Form of Law: Now because the Emperour Charles had ta∣ken these his Netherlands into the German League, and tha this Part had upheld the Majesty of his Empire; there were that said, that the Settlement of Religion was also included which may be easily answer'd thus; That although the Ne∣therlands might participate with Germany, both in Tribute and Immunities; yet it was very well known, that for man Ages last past, they were neither subject to their Laws, no the Decrees of their Synods: Not much differing from this Doctrine, there is another, illustrated chiefly by the Ingenuity of Zuinglius, and Calvin, and now for some time growing
up together with the Augustane; unless it may be said of Religions, that they are all made more subject to Obstinacy in Opinion, or Singularity, rather than Concord: That (to wit, of Zuinglius) part of Germany and Switzerland follow; but the other of Calvin, onely the famous City of Geneva, within the Dukedom of Savoy allows of: The same was also used in England, different onely in the Retention of some of the antient Rites; but the main and violent Followers of this Sect were in France; nor did the rest come near them in number: and therefore, both those and these, to wit, Zuing∣lians and Calvinists, judged this new Ordinance proposed by Philip, no less cruel, than he himself esteemed it mild▪ There was too another Complaint, that in stead of the desired Meet∣ings of the States General, the Judgments of the several Pro∣vinces were separately required, and that too but partially, not of all, not after the accustomed manner: In which Com∣motions, while the Regent expected further Orders from the King, and either to receive from him Souldiers, or Money to levy Souldiers, hoping Delays would blow over, or else mi∣tigate the greatness of the Danger; behold, on the contrary, the Vulgar, who till now had been frighted with the noise of Fire and Sword, begin now to affright others. They come out of their Corners, and appear in publike: they Celebrate their Devotions, and preach after the new Mode, as if they would publikely convince their Enemies of those Lies, wherewith they had slandered their private Meetings; Ex∣iles also, and such as had been persecuted onely for Reli∣gion, of whom there were not a few, even weary of their Lives, joyned with Straglers and Fugitives from Monaste∣ries: So that now there did appear a Formidable Multitude and so great, beyond Expectation, that those who had fre∣quented and used their Meetings, could hardly believe the same. This over-much assumed Liberty confirmed their Presum∣ption; for now, if at any time they fear Danger, they go
Armed: All which Rabble, the Confederate Nobles receive into their Protection, and arm them, as the common Vogue was, but that is not always infallible. And not long after, a great Sedition began of the Rascality of the People, but by whose Instigation is uncertain, wherein were seen many known Thieves: This is not medling with Towns or Fields, invades the Churches, where onely the Altars and their Furnitures, with the Shrines of Saints, went to wrack; re∣sembling herein the like Commotions of the Jews, and alto∣gether imitating that Barbarous Tempest of Image-hate that over-ran Greece; for their Savage Rudeness did not ab∣stain from the Persons of Priests, and Religious Men, but vented it self further on their Books and Sepulchres; as if in this so suddain a Rebellion (for other it cannot be called) there had been one general Agreement, to set all the Nether∣lands into a Combustion: in some places the Magistrates by either Civil or Armed Authority hardly prevailing: Onely the Inhabitants of Antoyes, Heynault, Luxemburgh, and those adjoyning to them, kept their Faith and Allegiance, both to the Romane Church, and the King, unspotted and un∣tainted, in the midst of this Horrid Contagion. In some places, the Magistrates, to prevent the Licention Fury of the People, did first begin to remove and take away Images; to some of whom boasting of their Service, Viglim said very ingeniously, That they too were mad but with a shew of Reason. Many things which were thus stollen from Churches, the Teachers urged, might be restored, but without any effect to the great Scandal of their Religion, which by these mean had contracted new Infamy. The Lady Margaret, in this great Perturbation of Affairs, being vehemently affrighted, was not able now so well to obey the King's Commands, who, though too late, had heard all these things at a distance, in regard of the imminent dan∣ge, because she was forced to give place to the Times, and
submit to the Counsels of the Confederate Lords; without whose Authority, they could not endure to hear of any thing. At length therefore, though with much Reluctancy, she was drawn to this; that she promised the Lords, that none of those former Actions should be drawn into question. They, now one, now another, as long as they could have any Secu∣rity, renounced the League, under this condition, That all that slighted the Name of the Romish Religion, or moderating thereof, should not be deied Pardon. And now, while the Peo∣ple lay aside their Arms and Faults together, they are allow∣ed to have Sermons in those places, which even till that time, they had had for their Instruction; and the Edicts were laid aside, until the King and the States should take other Order in that behalf. Presently Messengers were sent to se∣veral places, to prohibite any further Force, who did affirm, they had obtained this by Treaty, which in truth they extort∣ed by violence. First, the Prince of Aurange sent to Antwerp, being thn troubled with a dangerous Sedition; where, having obtained the Name of Viscount, or Sheriff, as due unto him from his Predecessors, he quickly brought that most strong City to his own Will, where not so much minding the necessity of the time, as to shun the Regents displeasure, he caused not onely the new Discipline, but Sermons also to cease; not onely in the Fields, as in other Places but within the very Walls. The same also did Count Horn, and others, whose Brother being now returned out of Spain, related unto him the Kings im∣placable Anger: But the Letters sent to the Lady Marga∣ret, and by them surprized, troubled them beyond measure, they being thereby destined to Accusation and Destructions whereupon they all meet to counsel at Dendremond, where Count Egmond was the chief man looked upon, as being well-skilled in Warlike Affairs, and well-beloved of the Souldiery.
But he, whether allured by fair promises, or mindfull of his duty, affirmed he would not in any thing be wanting in his Allegiance to his Prince, let him do what he would, but would rather seek to appease his mind with good Counsel and wipe away former errors by future fidelity. Unwise man that would not take notice, that when great things, in disobe∣dience to Princes, are begun with danger, after the first set∣ting out, the  of reward and safety, is in going on, for revenge attends every step backward; But the Prince of Aurange had a more prudent foresight, for seeing these begun undertakings failed, he writ Letters to the King, humbly desiring, that he permit to lay down all Offices, and that he might betake himself to peace and rest in some pri∣vate part of Germany. To whom Philip craftily sent answer, (and how far will deceit prevail under the mask of simplicity?) intreating him, that he would not now desert him, while his Affairs were in such an unsetled Estate, and when there was most need of his help; withall advising him, that he should for a time send away from him his Brother, who was suspected of innovation in Religion, untill all things should be better con∣sidered off. But Aurange the more crafty and subtle of the two, still urges for Licence to depart, and in the mean time, going back into the places under his own Government, for∣bidding all severity, and to prevent his surprise of the fortifi∣cations within those Provinces, by forreign Souldiers that might to that end be provided, under the pretence of liberty, he by his single industry and policy, stirred up all the valiant and couragious people to be at his Command. 1567. He set forth also in writing, the Counsel which he had given to the King, to this effect, That unless he gave Toleration to these Religions, which the Neighbouring Nations had granted as necessary, it would be a matter of dangerous consequence: for at the best, his Conquest would be attended with great mischief, in ex∣hausting the wealth, and destroying the people of the Country.
But Count Horne retreated to his own home, and there betook himself to a private life. These thus dispersed, the Regent, easily perceiving whence at first these perturbations did arise, betook her self to Viglius his former Counsels, which had been slighted, to wit, to break the connexion and band which was between the Lords, and the better and infe∣riour sort of the people; which she brought to passe, either by her self or others, with them that so receded, first by cavil∣ling, by and by more openly, as if she had been terrified thereby, would cast out the falling away of others; for no sooner was she advertised by the private order of the Judges, that they had proceeded against the persons who had committed Sacriledge in the tumult before mentioned, who had gone beyond words against the publick rites, even to the taking up of Arms, the rest, knowing themselves not able to go through with the management of their cause, and like∣wise that they differed among themselves in point of Religi∣on, broke up their strength. Nor did the confederate Lords, either by hope or fear, divided among themselves, lesse be∣tray the Weal-publick: for Conscience a little accusing for their evill deeds, some of them running over and submitting, obtained Pardon; others disswade the gathering of Taxes, and levying Bands of Souldiers, as things not fit for private men to undertake; another sort, while thus every one was mind∣ing his own particular, are forgotten by all. And now, for the better maintaining the peace of the State, the Regent, be∣side the German Souldiers, under the Command of Ericus of Brunswick, commanded another Regiment of Walloons to be forthwith raised; for by that name, the people in that part of the Netherlands, which borders upon France, are called, and are distinguished from the others, by the use of the French Tongue, and beside, are more valiant, and not so dull-witted as the rest; And that she might the better choose able Com∣manders over them, she caused them to take an Oath, to that purpose contrived, that they should take all persons without
exception, for enemies, whom the King should so de∣clare. This Oath was taken by Count Egmond, Charles Arscot of Croya, a person quite unconcerned in the former troubles. Charles Baylaymont and his Brothers; the Counts Peter Mans∣field, Governour of Lutzenburgh, Count Megem, Governour of Gelderland, Count Aremberg, Governour of Frizeland, and the Count of Noricum, that in Henault held the place of the Marquess of Berghen: And quickly did they begin to make the truth of their Oath appear by their actions; Eg∣mond infesting those in Flanders, the safeguard of whom he had undertaken. The Count of Noricum marcheth against Valenciennes, where were others of the Rebels, and by Siege forcing them to sur∣render, punished them with great severity: by which ex∣amples terrified, the best and greatest Cities, the troubles being thus for a time ended, received their appointed Garri∣son, the rest destroying and slaughtering all the remains of those mad people, that they could find any where together: onely the Prince of Aurange and Hochstraten, denyed to change their old Oath, by which they were obliged to de∣fend the King and Laws, for any other; Aurange adding further, that his Wife was one of that number, which by that Oath were destined to destruction. While these things were in agitation, the Spaniards (as they can see when they have an opportunity) did not slug∣gishly manage that happy occasion. And first, while the danger was yet scarcely removed, it was agreed almost on all hands, that the Presence and Majesty of the Prince would be very available for the quieting and composing of all par∣ties; the most faithfull and loyall among all the Netherlan∣ders, telling and assuring, that if the King should send ano∣ther, and not come himself, it would produce more hate and lesse obedience; which the Emperour Charles, the Kings Father, well knew, when upon a small disturbance, onely in
the City of Gaunt, he made no delay to come thither imme∣diately, though at that time France even yet breathed out Warre against him; But now a great deal of time was wast∣ed in vain and frivolous Discourses, which was the safest way for him to passe by, for they suspected France would hardly afford him passage either with or without any Army, and a Voyage by Sea was not judged fit, in regard of the many certain hazards thereof, besides his landing in Zeland might be doubted, for they could nor tell how far either the Prince of Aurange, or the English might attempt upon his person. Therefore the Resolution was, that he passe over into Liguria, and thence into Germany, and there to speak with the Emperour, and to try his pulse. The Emperour then was Maximilian, the Son of Ferdi∣nand, who upon consideration had of the Dutch Affaires, said, that unless Philip would in some measure give place to the present necessity of the times, it would be a dangerous un∣dertaking for him, by reason of the Princes of the Augusta Confession, that were bound to the Dutch Lords by many tyes of friendship, allyance and benefits; but if any way of moderation might be proposed, he offered himself as a Peace∣maker between them; but this was somewhat ill resented, as Augustus Elector of Saxony said, who was very great in Cae∣sars favour, and allied to the Prince of Aurange by his Bro∣thers Daughter. Letters now are sent to the Lady Margaret, which decla∣red the Kings approach, but not without an Army, for so it befitted his Majesty to keep up his Dignity among strangers; as also either, by the terror thereof, to appease all tumults, or if any durst stand to contest with him, that then he was pre∣pared for the future, not to receive, but to give Lawes. And indeed a little time made it manifest, that the Spaniards not content that they were quiet, began to look back for revenge, by making th Kings anger the meanes to compass their pri∣vate ends and advantages, for they offered as a pretence for
enslaving the Dutch, that they were all to be looked upon as Traytors, either because they had began those novel mis∣chiefs in Church and State, or else because they had not brought the persons that durst do such things unto condigne punishment; There are also that add, the Authority of an Oath formerly made by the Pope to Philip, when underta∣king the Government, he bound himself up to the Lawes, that the Netherlands should be governed as America, and the greatest part of Italy were; And the great credit given to the Duke of Alva's Counsels (who was no new fomenter of Tyranny) made all men believe, that unless so horrid an Ex∣ample of Rebellion were signally corrected with some re∣markable punishments, that it would cause others of his Sub∣jects to kick off their Allegiance, and therefore that not only the present force, but fear of like reward should keep them within their bounds: Nor was this so fit time of subjecting the Netherlands to be lost or neglected, for all the King∣doms lying round about, do faithfully observe the peace they have made with him, and if there were any thought of troubles, it was domestick, and arise at home. Thus were they over-ruled, who perswaded Peace and mo∣deration, Prince Charles the Son of Philip, offering his endea∣vour for the pacifying and ruling the Netherlands, but so much in vain, that it did prove to his harm, by encreasing those suspitions before conceived against him. At last, it was declared, the King having retired, as if upon matters of grea∣ter concernment, or else upon pretence that he might not be in danger, that the Duke of Alva should be sent thither with most ample Authority, nor is it to be doubted with what In∣structions, he being a man alwayes used to Warre and Blood∣shed, to whom being in Italy, the Messengers reported the Companies of old Spanish Souldiers from Naples, Scicily, Sar∣dinia, and Millaine, to be joyned with the Horse; the Prince of Aurange not thinking it fit to stay any longer, goes to Nassau, being then possessed by his Brother, protesting o∣penly
at his departure, before a great multitude of people that followed him, that he would not stir one foot further in this difference, unless he were assaulted or damnified. In whose absence, the Lady Regent commanded Maxi∣milian, Earl of Bossu, to take charge of his Lieutenancies. Brederode, when he had fortified what was his, and hovered about Ʋtrecht, near the Rhene and Amsterdam, two very wealthy Cities, (the Prince of Aurange favouring his first attempts) either by an under-hand assistance, or deceit, is shortly after forcibly driven out of the Country. Egmond, and some other meaner Lords, whose minds and fortunes could not suffer banishment, were led about with the hope of living, till they were brought to their ends un∣timely; but most of the Nobles, and many of the Commo∣nalty, for fear of the Spaniard, (though part of them fearing punishment returned, being not prepared to fly for Religion) went some into the next parts of Germany, some into Eng∣land, and some into farther distant Countries: the Regent, enforcing them by one Edict to fly, commands them by ano∣ther to stay. So that they being voluntarily departed, who were displeased at the present carriage of Affairs, and other matters, by the notable cunning of a Woman set in order, there was a setled Peace, such, as if nothing further had been coveted, might have longer continued.

troublesome, but accompanied with great wants; but there was some satisfaction for the same, by the present amend∣ment of his quarters here, by whose pleasantness and delight his Army was well increased; which, notwithstanding there were therein above eight thousand men, he kept in a mo orderly and strict Discipline; The Spaniards then being first shewed the way, through so great a Continent of Land. After this he met with no kind of stop, as far as Lutzemburg the chief of whose Governours, he had (the King being not wholly ignorant thereof) drawn to his party, for the better upholding the strength of that broken and disjoynted Domi∣nion. At this time, as if it had been by agreement, Warres broke out in France, the King having levyed and taken into pay certain Companies of Switzers, under pretence of sus∣pecting some soul play upon his Borders. And the truth is, Alva's Army had been scouring the places thereabout, of all such as took part with, and upheld that new Religion so much hated by them. All this while, there was not a Netherlander stirred, whe∣ther out of an extraordinary Panick fear, or too great Securi∣ty, is doubtful, to resist or withstand this furious Invasion; for though coming as a Generall in Warre unto a quiet People, he was received by the concourse of the People, not seeming at all discontented; for at the beginning, he took to himself no other Title, untill Margaret, weary of this empty shadow of troublesom honour, and thought also to have done much harm to the Government, by her feminine imbecillity; and so much the rather, because she had by po∣lite and well composed Letters, presaging many of the fu∣ture evills, disswaded the sending of Alva with an Army; by her departure thence, wholly left the Regency of the Ne∣therlands to his care and ordering, none now doubting, but he would now make himself a Magistrate contrary to those Laws, by whose rule, and with whose safety he could not at∣tain thereto; It being provided therein, cautiously from an∣tiquity,
that none but a Netherlander, or a Prince of the blood, could take that upon him. The first Experiment of his Tyrannizing Authority, was shewed upon Egmond and Horn, who being by Policy wrought to come ino the Court, were apprehended, and put into Custody; and when they demanded the Priviledge of the Golden Fleece, to be judged onely by the Companions of that Order, their Peers, it was not onely denied to them, but they were sent out of Brabant with a strict Guard, con∣trary to the Rights and Liberties granted even to the meanest of the Commons: And, from this time, Garrisons were set in the prime Cities of the Netherlands, which consisted chief∣ly of Spaniards, who were almost the onely men thereof; for other Souldiers were made use of onely in times of danger, and upon extraordinary occasions: Nay further, the Troops of Horse, which were mostly made up of the Netherlandish Gentry, having some Spaniards thrust in amongst them, were sent into France, under the Leading of Count Aremberg, that by a present Supply, they might confirm the League made with King Charles: In the interim, the Castles are begun to be filled, with unarmed and peaceable Citizens; and which was most grievous to them of all, was, That their Thraldom was made use of, to raise Monies for supply of their Enemies Expences and Charges: When Things had proceed∣ed thus far without any gain-saying, there were almost Twelve Judges, the greatest part of them Spaniards, the rest but Servants to them, and in that regard, as cruel, if not worse then they, appointed to call before them all such as had any any hands in the late Commotions, or but seemed to wink thereat, and to punish them as they saw fit; not in the least manner taking notice of them, who, by the Laws of the Coun∣try, had a Jurisdiction proper thereunto: And this very Thing, of enjoying the Judicial Power, and consequently, that of Life and Death, was the main prop of their Authori∣ty; which adding a Majesty to the Religion before violated,
Recriminations, as hateful to good Princes, as they are com∣modious to Tyrants, urge, That all Guilty Persons should be p out of the Protection of the Law, and that onely the Cruelty  Alva's Name might be sufficient almost to convince them. Th strictness of the Guards, set upon the Guilty Persons, wa the cause of the Death of very many People; so that every place carryed the Resemblance of a City sacked, and taken by the Sword: For there were not onely Armies, but by rea∣son of the Troubles, many sought Refuge, and here put in practice their ill-boding Counsels: Here also were some earnestly labouring for Honour; and others, on the other side, by all means avoiding it, while the slaughter of the Nobles, and all others, whose Wealth or Authority grieved them, made great Additions by their Deaths to the Authority, and by their Fortunes, to the Treasury and Prey of the Spa∣niards: And the truth is, Alva never dissembled his Inten∣tions; for from the very first, he protested, with great Threats, suitable to the Cruelty of his Nature, that a few Sal∣mons Heads were of more worth than many Thousands of little Fishes; Thus after a new Mode, making use of that old Sentence, which teaches, to strengthen a Kingdom, by taking away some of the Heads of the chiefest Common-wealths Men. All the Mischiefs which had intervened here, since the first Breach with Granvel, unto this time, were now objected against Egmond and Horn, together with a shrewd Suspition of a Conspiracy, between them and the Prince of Aurange, to throw the King, by Force, out of his Dominion over the Ne∣therlands, and then to divide them among themselves. These two, that by all mens confession, were most eminent men, and as well Renowned by their Actions, as the Nobility of their Birth, at Bruxels, after Divine Service, according to the Ro∣mane manner, had been performed, in the publike place of Execution, yielded their Necks to the Sword of the Heads∣man, and their Heads for a while after fixed upon Poles, was to the Dutch both a lamentable and terrible Spectacle; and
although the Souldiers every where about in Arms, watched but for an Opportunity from the Words, and almost Looks of the People; yet they bearing the same deeply in Mind, the pity of all, but the Revenge of the more valiant, be∣came setled, when the Solemnities of their Funerals were Celebrated, and their very Coffins washed with the Tears and Kisses of an incredible Multitude of the common Peo∣ple, while others, after the old manner of Mourning, in a vowed Habit, promise and swear, Never to cut their Hair, untill they had revenged the Blood of those Noble-men. The Prince of Aurange, with many others, are cited by a Proclamation to appear; and because being absent, and out of their reach, he laughed at their Threats of Punishment; all his Goods are confiscated, and his Son which was bred up at Levain, in the Study of the Arts, is seized upon, and carried Prisoner into Spain. It was a very sad thing to take notice of the Desolation and Wast that was here made, partly by Slaughters, and partly by Flight: Some few, whose exceeding Poverty would not bear out their Banishment, retired into the Woods, and there hiding themselves, where they lived like Salvages upon the daily Spoils committed upon Priests, not taking Notice of the Magistrates, who came to suppress them by Force, but robbing and killing them, as they could find advantage; un∣til at last they were destroyed and driven away by the greater and more powerful strength of Alva: So also, at the Rivers Maze and Rhene, a few unadvised persons being scatteredly met together, and having sworn the Dukes death, at the very first Rencounter, were all overcome and slain: And to cut off all thoughts of hope, the Messengers and Curriers from Spain brought word, that then was nothing of moderation more to be expected from the King than from Alva, for that a publike punishment was there inflicted upon Montaigne, who was sent thi∣ther, in vain bearing with him the Name of an Embassador as to Enemies, which among all Nations is sacred, and not to be vio∣lated;
for it was not thought fit for Subjects, to treat or deal with their Prince after such a manner, and so positively denied. The Marquess of Berghen, by a seasonable Death, prevented to himself the like Fate, though not without Suspition of Poy∣son: But the very Thoughts of such a thing was condemned as a Crime, because Alva had a hand therein. There was about the same time a louder, though more my∣stical Rumour of the Death of Charles the Kings Son: It was evident, that he, though the Heir of so many Great King∣doms, was put into Ward; whether his too much forward∣ness in his Youth, had raised a Suspition of him, that he was ambitious of Rule, as if his Care for the Netherlanders had been too great for his Interest there; or whether the same Crime were laid to his Charge, which had taken off his Step-Mother, is uncertain: But this is sure, that shortly after he died, though still very dubious, what Causes could so provoke the Fathers Wrath to that heighth, as to work his Sonne death. The Exiles, who now, though at distance, were every where against their Wills, and in Poverty, being much grie∣ved at the Oppression of their Country, did earnestly sollicies the Prince of Aurange to take up Arms, which of his own accord, he was not at all propense to do; willing rather, the the Spaniard should over-un all, until all his Counsels were laid open, and there might be hoped a more safe Opportunity for the Distressed to gather and unite a Force, while the King should, for the most part, be taken up with other Wars. Nevertheless, some of the Exiles, at present, being drawn together, under the Leading of Lewis of Nass brake into Frizeland: There, by the Death of Arembery there slain, whom the heat and reviling of his Souldiers com∣plled to fight (though he thought it more Prudence weary them out by Delays) by the Rout and Overthrow his Forces, became Conquerours; but staying, with a fruitle Expectation of some Towns falling off to them, their Moefell
short for the Souldiers Pay, so that all Discipline was neglected, when suddaintly by the Surprize of Alva, they were almost all slain, Adolph, the Prince of Aurange his Bro∣ther, and Lewis his also, being killed in the former Skirmish, they had tincted the War alternately, both with their own, and their Enemies Bloud. The Prince of Aurange, being throughly moved with this Carriage of Affairs, that he might be the better able to relieve his Parties, both by strength, and the Justice of their Govern∣ment, he sets forth in Books a Narrative, the Reasons, Causes, and Justice, of their taking up Arms; refuting, at once, both the Judge, and the Crimes objected against him; not dissem∣bling, That now being taught better things, he had lft the Church of Rome; yet calling God to Witness, That he took Arms for the Publike Weal, and freeing his Countrey from Sla∣very: That this was the Duty of every good Citizen, much more of a Noble-man: Of Philip he spoke honourably, whose Goodness (he said) was perverted by the Spanish Counsels; and that he did not yet despair, but that he would, at length, resume better thoughts of his faithful Subjects, and uphold their sworn and setled Laws. In the mean while, according to the Law of Brabant, in regard of his many Errours in Government, O∣bedience was due unto him, as to their Soveraign. Lastly, that which seems to make most for the Justice of their Cause, was this; The Brabanders, as they had a more special and wary care than the rest, for the maintaining their Liberty; so likewise to prevent the Incroachmnt of their Princes, who, under pretence of the Publike, did not stick somtimes, to break up and dissolve their State-Conventions; they used to Covenant of their own proper Right, that when any Prince infringed the Laws, they should be free from the Bonds of their Fidelity and Obedience to him un∣till the Wrongs so done should be removed and satisfied. And this confirmed by many Examples of their Ancestors, who when formerly some of their Princes, either through their own weakness, or the Delusions of Flatterers, had been drawn
away, they drew to more moderation (among whom the most remarkable was, John the Second of that Name) ei∣ther by Force, or strong Decrees, by them drawn up; which, before they would conclude any Peace, they made the Princes freely promise, That they would without any violation confirm and establish the same. Now, the Prince of Aurange, though born in Germany, yet had obtained many most Noble Heri∣ditary Jurisdictions in Brabant; to the Lords, or Possessors whereof, antient Custom had given the Dignity of being a Peer, or chief Governour; by which Right, he urged, That is did belong to him, not onely to see the Laws well executed, but also to defend and maintain them. But here it is not to be omitted, that the same Right was claimed by the like Customs, by divers other of the Nether∣landish Provinces; and also, that the Decrees of Maximilia of Austria and Mary of Burgundy, were to be taken no∣tice of; which had made them, by the same Sanction of the Laws, individually equally with the Brabanders themselves: And this appears, by what the People of Frizeland, Utrech, and Gelderland did, in the time of the Emperour Charles their Prince; when, among many other peculiar Agreements and Covenants, there was this one common and general, That they might never be divided from Brabant and Holland. While these Matters were argued pro & contra, Maximilian the Em∣perour much troubled thereat; and also taking into commise∣ration, the Prince of Aurarge his Condition, so suddainly thrust out by violence from such great Estates and Prehem∣nences, (though that Design of his, wrought no milder Tem∣per toward those Dominions) sent his Brother Charles into Spain, to inform the King in his (to wit, the Emperours) Name, and the rest of the Princes of Germany, That they thought it not convenient for the Publike Good, that the Nether∣landers should be used so harshly any longer. But Philip, as well as he could, dissembling his Anger; yet churlishly commanded, to be returned for Answer, That
the Care of managing his own Affairs, belonged properly to him∣self; who, as he knew when it was fit to shew Mercy, so likewise he was not to learn, when to use Severity to such, who having first laid aside their Duty towards God, would, in a short time, not fear to shake Hands with Obedience to their Prince; and that it would be an Action more safe and honourable for them, if they would desist to intermeddle in Affairs, in which they were altoge∣ther unconcerned. There were some, that counselled the regaining of those Parts of Lower Germany by Warre, which had been torn from the Body by the strong Hand of their Lords: But the Em∣perour, of his own Nature, always loving Peace; and being lately allyed to the Spaniard, by a new Tye of Affinity sate down, and medled no more: But a few of the Germans, ei∣ther out of their regard to Piety, Envy of the Spanish Great∣ness, or Hatred of Alva, too well known among them, did aid the Prince of Aurange with Men and Money; and it may be also moved with Suspition, that Alva had a Design upon some Cities, near the Rivers Rhene and Amasis, to sub∣ject them to his Master, because they had been Receptacles to many of the Netherlanders, banished for their Religion: Ma∣ny of the Neighbouring People, had bound themselves by Hostages, to be true to, and assist the Prince of Aurange in his Expedition; and something also was given by the Ne∣therlanders, who now being compelled to inhabit abroad, either the Desire of return to their Country, or private Wishes of enjoying Liberty at Home, prompted: But many of those Promises failed in their Event; so that having, by the Dictates of his own Judgment and Fore-sight, gathered together Six Thousand Horse, and Fourteen Thousand Foot, chiefly, and the greatest part out of Germany, where great Multitudes of Men, caught with the Bait of present ready Money, never thought of the future, nor minded whose part they took, but were ready for any that would hire them best, the remainder of the said Army was made up partly of Ne∣therlanders
themselves, and partly of French: These Forces letting slip the first Opportunity of fighting Alva, at the Passage of the Maze, being then unprovided, were afterward by him easily weakned, and brought to nothing, by not fight∣ing getting the more noble sort of Victory: Which Policy of evading Fight, had before that been fortunate to him  Italy, when he stood in opposition to the Duke of Guise Therefore, for three and twenty days together, he lay stil in the Rear of them, as they marched, with his Camp so cir∣cumspectly, and with Prudence, fortified toward the Ene∣my, that they could never force him to fight with their De∣speration: Then was put in practice that Villany, which will never be left off; to wit, that both Parties should main∣tain their Right, by Countries living in Peace; for whether a Passage was given, or denied, through the Lands of Cleve or Leige, always the one Party would revenge it self, either by robbing the Country, or burning it: However, at last this great Army, being neither admitted by one City, nor relie∣ved with any Provision, in a short time mouldred away, through an extream want of all things, but chiefly of Pay; with the slender Remains whereof, the Prince of Aurange being hardly able to march into France, carryed thither, to∣gether with it all his Hopes; where, for some time, finding Employment in that Forreign Warre,1569. though the cause thereof were something his, (for Alva had sent thither Forces also to help the King) yet by the suddain making of Peace, he was disappointed; and not onely so, but Traps laid to insnare him. The Army being thus broken, whereby, without doubt, the Nassauian Strength was much impaired and exhausted, as he grew very wary how he ran into Dangers: So Alva, great now with Success, esteeming himself a Conquerour of those People, whom he had yet never felt as Enemies, did ambitiously desire the Glory of his Authority, thus won (as he supposed) by Conquest: And under this Notion, and
Name of Conquerour, he is presented with a Consecrated Sword from the Pope, with an Inscription of his Deeds, as Fame had reported them: which being a Piece of most ex∣cellent Workmanship, he placed in the beautiful Castle of Antwerp, that serves to no other use, than to keep under the People; as the Scituation thereof, averted from the River, doth plainly testifie: Moreover, he erects a Statue in his Honour, with a large Eulogy thereon; to wit, that by appea∣sing the Sedition, destroying and punishing the Rebels, and promoting of Justice, he had restored Peace to these Provin∣ces. At this time he setled many things, no lesse profitable than specious, as concerning money, Merchandises, punishment of vices and enormities, and rash divulging of Books, works in themselves so good, that they will never be forgotten; un∣less by the Odium of his name, who was the first settler thereof: But now the Inquisition, as to matters of Religion, the Acts of the Councel of Trent, the new Bishops, and things hitherto winked at, if not utterly repudiated, were re∣ceived willingly as it were, for otherwise it was in sight that would compel them; their hatred being now grown to that heighth, that who over had been baptized by the Protestants, according to the Rules of Christianity, should yet be re-bap∣tized, though contrary to the institution and practice of the Antients; Nor did this new Tribunall grow lesse furious a∣gainst the old crimes of Treason, to the number of whom, were added all such as were but suspected to have wished good success to the late undertakings of the Prince of Au∣range, or to have grieved at the ill fortune and miscarriage thereof; yet while these things are thus doing, there was a way studied, how to make their Victory seem more honou∣rable, by the report of Clemency; which was this, By set∣ting out an Edict in the Kings name, wherein a Pardon should be granted to all that would come in and confess their former mis∣deeds, but still excepting and reserving to punishment, all Teach∣ers
and Ministers of Religion, and those which did assist or har them; all those whose impious villanies violated the Sacred ∣cesses of Churches, or holy places, and all such as here Arms,  took preferment, or were consenting to the confederacy of t Nobles s certainly, a goodly Company of Exceptions, the Liberties also of Towns and Universities, and whatsoever the Kings Treasury was indebted to any man, being reserved to the Kings pleasure. Now having thus laid aside all fear and shame, the ve utmost intentions and designs of the Spaniards were laid  pen in their open boastings, for the bringing to passe therof that not onely the charges of the Government, but if ne were, Warre should be maintained at the charge of the Provinces; and to make this good, Alva commands for th present, the hundreth part of all the Revenues of the people to be levyed; which in it self was very grievous, because  was forcibly commanded by the Souldier, which ought  have been collected according to the Custom of the Coun∣try; nor did he exempt the Priests from this payment: after this be takes the twentieth part of Lands, and the tenth of all other thing whatsoever, sold upon every alienation, af∣firming to the Spaniards, that it was necessary thus to tax the Netherlanders, that they might the rather think themselve bound in equity to obey, being bound by the Law, and co∣quered by Arms, and not otherwise capable of Pardon. It may easily be imagined, that these Impositions ha spoyled Merchandizing, and broken the connexion of most Arts and Trades, by the flight of so many, so that the chiefe support of the People was utterly gone; for the profit ac∣crewing by buying and selling of Wares, using to be disper∣sed into severall Channels, if so great a burden should be come to be a part, of the price, there would be no Chapmes found to buy, when in another place, they might have them so much cheaper; And if any durst be so bold as to find streight they were seized on by Souldiers, and most exqui∣sitely
punished. Nay, some Provinces and Cities being somewhat stubborn and self-willed, were sometimes majesti∣cally summoned and questioned, both what they had done themselves, and what they had suffered others to do against the Kings Edicts, being objected against them; and though the madness of some private persons, for the common cause, were not compelled to their evill deeds, yet were they sen∣tenced, that they should be out of the protection of the Law, excluded from all publick Counsels, and for the future, be governed by no other Law than that of the Kings will. Nay, some were punished for appealing to the King, and the intercessions of the Magistrates were restrained by a mulct, which they should pay out of their own Estates upon forfei∣ture; with the severity of which examples, the rest being terrified, did endeavour to redeem themselves from this infi∣nite oppression with a certain sum of money. And yet for all these so many and great afflictions, the wrath of God was not yet appeased towards these people for their sins; but as if the cruelty and avarice of men had not been sufficient for the persecution of a Land, most flourishing and opulent, both in Wealth and Inhabitants: the Ocean breaking o∣ver its bounds with such an overflux,1570. as the like hath scarce ever been seen before, by its inundation, made one great slaughter of men, and foretold another. For this was the time, in the small Punctillio whereof, the basest of servitude, and the highest point of liberty being divided, by both names continued equall miseries and misfortunes: And now anger suggesting unto the oppressed, the desire to free, or revenge themselves by Arms, they were taught, there was no concord so firm and stable, as that which is contained within the Bond of private concerns. And now that Nation which had so patiently seen her Ci∣tizens burnt, her Governours slain, her Laws, Religion, and Common-wealth almost to be violently taken away and de∣voured, first consented to take vengeance for the former, and
to prevent and keep off thse evills that immediately hng over their heads. And so in the City of Bruxels, though Alva himself were present, and with a strong Guard did sternly exact the tenth, yet every one shut up their Shops and Ware-houses, scorning to own or confess their slavery, though with the perill of their Heads. Now were Gibbets and Hangmen prepared for the Rebels (as they were termed) when news came of the Commotions in Holland, which I shall presently declare to you, and put a stop to their cruelty; The fury and indignation of the People increasing, infused new Courage into the Prince of Aurange, that he might once more try the fortune of Warre, though yet his Confidence flagged, till his Resolution became setled, by con∣sidering, that part of Philips Forces were imployed against the Turk, and that Spain it self was yet scarce quiet from the distur∣bances and incursions of the Moors; if therefore he could but get Arms, himself would be Captain, and he hoped through their dis∣sentions, he should be able to find or make a way. 1571. To that purpose, he sends choyce persons to all Princes, that professed themselves Reformers of Religion, praying them, either publickly to take his part, or at least to grant him private Ayds towards the support of the common Cause. The Dea and Swede positively deny him, as fearing to cope with an Adversary more powerful than themselves; not durst the Queen of England disturb her Neighbours great∣ness, although the Pope had given Her over to be a prey, and Alva for the Genoa Merchants money, detained in England for present use, and under assurance of repayment, begin∣ning a difference, and bringing it almost to Pledges, sought long agoe a Cause of Warre against that rich Island, as was suspected; and now lately, when there were some troubles in the North part of that Kingdom, he sent some to view the Ports, that might, if opportunity succeeded to his desires, upon such occasion be leaders; and without peradventure he
was a great encourager of the Endeavours of the Queen of Scots against Elizabeth; the knowledge of all which things, were for the present so dissembled, and Spain so far obliged, that the Nassavian Messengers were commanded without any delay, by a certain day, to depart out of the English Territo∣ries: But in France, they who had laid aside the Rites of the Latine Church, that they might give credit to the Peace they had, were admitted into the Grace and favour of the King; and therefore, that they might be the better able to assist the Prince of Aurange, they add fresh fire to e old Burgundian fuel, repeating the Controversie that first ose in the Coun∣cil of Trent, between these Kings for priority of place; ur∣ging also against Philip, the poysoning of his Wife Elizabeth, whose murder ought to be revenged, and that he was in Ho∣nour obliged to the like for satisfaction of those French Sub∣jects, murdered by the Spaniards in Florida, a Province of America; which Counsel, King Charles listning to with greedy ears, would have to believe that he was sensible there∣of; another motive wherewith they enveighed him, was upon the Marriage of his Sister, agreed with the King of Navarre, they gave him cause to think himself deceived therein: It was good Counsel, to meet a powerful Foe with the Con∣junction of Neighbours, and here the ingenuity of the French, found it needful to have Warre that they might keep peace. It was cast out as a Secret, but with great diligence, the League being broken, what the Emperour Charles said to the King, being his Prisoner, in reproch of the name and Ho∣nour of France, That the old limits of France should be restored, and the Empire extend even to the Rhene; what was beyond, the Prince of Aurange in words had already assumed to himself, as the reward of all his pains. By these instigations, the King was so wrought upon, that moneys are speedily dispatched to him, together with Counsel and advice by Lewis, who went between them; whom Caspar Colimac, a chief Leader in the
new Religion, had brought to treat and discourse with the King. The Kings Navy also, upon the Coast of Guyen, was fit∣ted and prepared, and Prizes taken in Spanish Vessels were publickly sold in the City of Rochel; The Spanish Embassa∣dor in vain complaining, made their confidence increase by their deceits: In the interim, the Prince of Aurange full fraught with the same and repute of so potent an Allye, either by Embassies or Letters, promiseth to the banished Nether∣landers, resettlem in their own Country, and to those that are oppressed at me, Liberty: and doth perswade many Governours of Cities, either to mutiny or revolt, not valuing either the force, fear, or hate of Alva. Thus relying on his strength, and the industry of his People, he made a good force at Sea; for every banished Netherlander, who had any Courage, and all those more indigent people, that were a∣fraid of banishment, got aboard into some kind of Ships, and taking others, which they met, by force from their owners, they much increased their number, they hovered to and again upon the Coast, and not onely there, but even in the very O∣cean or high Sea, as Pyrates, got their Living, by robbing all they could seize on. The Prince of Aurange had the shew of Authority and Command over this insolent multitude (though indeed, there was neither civility nor Government among them) by Let∣ters missive, and the like, authorizing them as by Com∣mission. The Admirall of this Fleet, William Count Marque, Sur∣named Lumey, of a disposition that rather inclined to cru∣elty then Courage, which was accounted his chiefest vertue, his Counsel to most of his Companions and followers, as well as his own minde, intended nothing but depredations. Thus accoutred and followed, as it seemed good to the Su∣preme Providence, whom it had pleased hitherto in the Af∣fairs of these Countries, so to frustrate humane Confidence,
and Counsels, that great and over-blown hopes should never be attended with happy success. 1572. Twenty four indifferent Ships, being Com∣manded off the English Coasts, Sail towards West-Frizeland, to try their Fortune in the beginning a Warre against the chiefest Potentate of Christendom; but the Wind being a∣gainst them, drove them through an extream scarcity of ne∣cessaries, on one of the biggest Isles, they call it Vorne, and there is the mouth of the River Maze, where the Souldiers and Seamen between fear and Courage, with a sudden fury set upon the Town of Brill: not that they intended to make any long stay there, but onely intended it as a place of re∣freshment for a few dayes; But the more prudent of them, together with the conveniency of the place, desired that they might become sensible of their Victory, in the retenti∣on of the place: Thus all things among them hapning by chance, except difference in opinions, insomuch, that when some Bands of Spanish Souldiers entred the Island, under the Command of Maximilian Bossu, their Captain, who then was Governour of Holland; the Invaders, as if they had been distracted by a suddain fear, fled, not one of them da∣ring to go against him; and this, forsooth, because the Townsmen had set fire upon their ships. Bossu, in his return from hence, required passage through Roterdam; which they, sensible of the Mischiefs of a Garri∣son, granted; but with this Proviso, that the greatest part of the Souldiery being sent away, the rest should enter: But contrary to these Covenants, the Souldiery forthwith broke in, and made a great slaughter of the Inhabitants within the Town. This Barbarous Treachery so incensed the inraged Minds of the Hollanders, that most of them voluntarily, part forced by the violence of the People, the appearance of their Neigh∣bours in Arms, or else by the necessity of Commerce, openly declared their great Affection to the Exiles, and their wil∣lingness
to admit them: For the Duke of Alva had  no Castles here, believing himself safe enough, in the de right simplicity of the People, who having hitherto bin  quiet then all the rest, did now, being abused, break out  the greater Fury. Besides, part of the Spanish Forces, b little before, had been drawn thence to punish Ʋtrecht, her Warlike Injuries done them; for that City, under Confidence of her Religion, had most vehemently withst the commanded Impositions: And Alva, at the first Ne of this Tumultuous Insurrection, had sent for those who we in Roterdam, vainly fearing they should have been Besiege there. The Town of Flushing followed the Example of Holland being greatly disturbed with the sight of the Castle, which was in Building, to keep them in awe, and not willing to re∣ceive a Garrison, which was intended to be placed among them: These having seized Bacies a Savoyard, the most ex∣cellent Surveyor of Alva's Works, and hurried him away  punishment, they Declare Themselves for the Common Cause. In like manner, others in Zeland turned out the Spaniards so that now from this new Face of Affairs, and the Assist∣ance that daily almost came to them, out of the Kingdoms o France and England, they began to hope for Liberty. Cou William, who was by affinity related to the Prince of Au∣range, rather trusting to the Honour of that Name, than b own strength, assures Gelders, and Over-Issel: Hereupon Ne∣derwormter, and shortly after Schoneberge, make Incursions in∣to Frizeland, being admitted into their strongest and best Ci∣ties, with the free good-will of the Citizens: The Prince of Aurange did not much rejoyce, when he received the News of these Commotions of the People, complaining, That he was prevented by such a Chance, and that his Force was not as ready, as his Consent with them. In this disordered an unsetled Body, some of the Nobles of Holland, and Commis∣sioners
of the Chief Cities, meeting at Dordrecht, assumed and put on the first Species or Habit of a Common-Wealth: Hi∣ther did the Prince of Aurange send, whom the States of Holland, although absent, because his Lieutenancy and Go∣vernourship was taken from him, without any lawful cause, chose to be their Governour, as also to be the General and Manager of the War, against the proud Domineering of a. Now there began to be daily Fights both at Sea and Land; wherein, as to the Land-Fights on Foot, the Spaniard was too hard for the other, being rude yet, and undisciplin'd, but at Sea was not able to meet, for it was their proper Sphere, in which they were as it were born. The Zelanders, in these parts, got many notable Victories thereby, and by their De∣predations at Sea, relieving the Publike Wants. And the Duke of Medina-celi, being lately named Successor to Alva, that he might be made plyable to Intreaty, by Repentance, his Fleet being happily taken, wherein he was brought from Spain, and himself hardly escaping, refused to meddle in the Government, least in so great Differences of Affairs, he might reap to himself the blame and disgrace that another had merited. Alva not at all moved with these Dangers, was as outra∣gious as ever, and would neither look upon them as Enemies, nor take notice of their strength; but when at any time he got any into his power, he exercised his Malice upon them, as upon Rebels: And now Revenge, and a like Cruelty, raged upon all Prisoners on both Sides without Differences; so long as mutual Necessity, which of old had taught People that were Enemies, made them also know, that to spare the shedding of Bloud, was not available to the finishing of the Warre. Being now thus well acquainted at Land, with the use of Arms, the Nassauians coutagiously kept possession of the Sea: A space of Breathing is given to these of Holland and Zeland, where∣by they may unite the stronger, while they are left to them∣selves,
and the greatest part of their Garrisons drawn off  Alva, to the Siege of Mons a City in Henalt, which Lewis  Nassau had taken by a Military Stratagem; the Souldiers  Valenciennes turned out of their Neighborhood to them in t Castle, being also come to the Spaniard: For the Relief  Nassau, who defended Mons in Henault, there came out o France Five Hundred Horse, and Five Thousand Foot, th King taking no notice thereof; which was them looked ¦on as a Confirmation of their private League: The Pri of Aurange came likewise out of Germany with an Army greater than that he had in his first Expedition; It was pro∣bable, that this War might have spread it self far abroad with greater Terrour, if the Spaniards had not intercepted the un∣wary French, in their well-known March, by Surprize; whereby they took Prisoner their Captain Jenlisius, the Ge∣neral of the whole Army, and divers other Nobles, for who t Safety King Charles earnestly interceding, was the last Act of this Jained Dvise: for suddainly a Messenger brings the Prince of Aurange the terrible News of the French Treache∣ries, and informs him also of the Imprisonments, both of Navarre, and Conde; and that the Confederate Power of the Faction of Guise, having first seasoned it self with the Bloud of Coliniac, proceeded thence over all the Kingdom, whose onely Law then vvas Murder; and the Hatred of the mad∣ding Vulgar, doubly armed against the Followers of the new and abominated Religion. This was the end of that dissembled Peace, of that deplorable Marriage, and of all those Delusions of their Friendship and Society. Being thus deprived of his main Hope, the King of Franc having thus broken his Promises, to clear himself to Philip, and regain his Friendship, he pays off some of his Troops, and by such Counsels and Actions getteth it: The Prince is forced to Disband his Army, and scarce avoiding a Mutiny, with what Fortune had left him, goes into Holland, where,
being disappointed of all his Hopes and Endeavours, he ac∣cepts of what they, beyond his Expectan, had freely cast upon him: The Surrender of Mons fws not long after, with which Victory flesht, they insulted over Mechlin, and other Cities, which had either assisted the Prince of Aurange, in his passage by them, with Money or Provision, as if they had been absolute Conquerours of them: Thence the Ter∣rour of them spreading further all those Places, that we men∣tioned before to be seized in Frizeland, and near the River Issel, were, by the Cowardliness of their Governours, left to be new Garrisoned by the Spaniards: Zutphen also is taken by Frederick, the Duke of Alva's Son, while they  to surrender; where raging in Bloud, after  all manner of Villanies and Rape, upon the  the Town, they slew all, without any regard either  Age. Not long after, Narda, a Town of Holland, rece like Barbarous usage, and their Walls are pulled o sides, after the method of Revenge taken by the Anti  The Spaniards were wont, in other Wars, to do tha believing these Crueltes were convenient, for the accelerat∣ing and speeding their Victory; when, on the contrary, Ex∣perience affirms, that men are overcome by no means so soon as Clemecy, when the other doth rather heighten mens spleen and courage, when all trust and hope of Pardon being taken away, they fear the Mischiefs of Peace greater and heavier than those of Warre; by which means, their Desperation car∣rying them beyond Hope, their Counsels are more delibe∣rate and their Actions valiant; so that after this, no City ever will be rendred, until it hath suffer'd the uttermost Ex∣tremities. I suppose it very convenient, to take a View of all the Parts together, of this growing Commonwealth, when in this Tempestuous Storm, there is a strong Contention begun by Warre for Liberty, which then no mortal man could judge,
would be so long time before they ended. The Hollanders onely and those of Zaeland continued still in Arms, the Sci∣tuation of which People, together both with their Artie and Modern Names, I will declare, that they may the better be understood, throughout the whole Series of this Discourse This was, in Elder Times, the most famous Isle of the Batavi, in the middle between Germany and the Gaules, most fitly scituated, for the transmitting and carrying over of Warre The Inhabitants took both their Name and Original from the Catti; on the Out-sides and Skirts thereof much frequented by the Romanes, and partaking of their Civility, which the rest wanted: For their Skill in Horsemanship and Swim∣ming, and the Fidelity and Valour of their Auxiliary For∣ces, most famous: Nor were they less than eminent in that Warre, which beginning in the Emperout Vespatians time, stirred up the Gaules to seek their Liberty. After which, sometimes the Frankes, other whiles the Saxons; and lastly the Angles, or English, seated themselves in these Parts some others, the Slavonians and Varni. The Rhene distin∣guished into two Channels, one of its own Name; the other called Wale, and running chiefly in two great Streams to the Ocean, surround this Island: That on the Right-side, wer out not far from Leyden, of old but small; but after obstructed with Satid, brought thither by the Force of Tempestuous Wea∣ther, turned his Waters into the Leck. On the Left, the Wale being mix'd with the Maze, was kept in by Banks: At this day, before it comes thither, by the interposition of sundry Islands, and its often overflowings, it may almost pass for a Sea. The Third Mouth of the Rhene, which from the Right run further into the North, Drusus opened; for a River being brought by the Souldiers Labour, in the Floud of Issel, and thence drowning it self in a Lake, which bounded the Fri∣sons, and incurvating it self toward the Island Flie, runs into the Sea by this same first received Name.
But the Face of Things and Places here are now so chang'd, that there can be no River seen; but on the contrary, the Sea hath broke in upon the Land; and though at first it seem from a narrow Entrance, but a little to increase, yet a little further, you may presently see it open like a great Gulph. The beginning therefore of this Country of old, called Batavia, retains in part its old Name, and is called Geldres, whose Lordship growing into wideness, is bounded by the River Maze and Issel. Over-Issel joyns in Neighbor∣hood to thi;, having on its side the Greater Frizeland running out as far as the River Eemes, then turns about its back to other Parts of Germany: Below Geldres, where it is called Welawe, is Utrecht, with some Neighbouring Towns, which are under the Rule of a Bishop, as likewise all Over-Issel; untill the Emperour Charles first of all added them to his own Government: Next, we find Holland now most plen∣tifully stored both with Cities and Villages, running out with two Corners in the Wale, and the before-mentioned Gulph, by little and little getting from the Water on both sides: It spreads a large Shore to the Ocean, whose more Northerly Parts, were sometimes part of Frizeland; but part∣ly by Arms, and partly by Agreement, now joyned to Hol∣land; who lying over against the Flie on the West, have kept the Speech of West-Frizeland. All the Country of Holland is full of many Arms of Rivers, and Inlets of Lakes, and Wa∣ter-Courses made by Art and Labour, and is more fertile in Pastures than Corn; there no is Country abounds more in Fishing and Navigation, both in Rivers and the Sea, than this Zeland, divided into several Islands, borders on this, being environed with the two Rivers Maze and Scalde, on the Back also joyned with Brabant by Honta, and by the Ri∣ver Scalde divided from Flanders; which, among Forreigners, hath merited to give the Name to all the Netherlands: This Tract of Land, lies all upon and open to the Sea, even unto Calais, and is that part of the Netherlands, which is now
under the Dominion of the French. Some have conjectured, that the Danes plying up and down these parts as Pira have left some Reliques of their Speech behind them, in the names both of Holland and Zeland; but I having perused many Monuments of Antiquity, finde this a common name to all the Islands; but I believe it was a more proper and pe∣culiar name, to a small Region, not far from Leyden, barred and rough, by reason of thick Woods, for the name signifie so much. This is clear, that when those Northern Nations raged o∣ver all these parts of the World, committing Rapes, Mur∣thers, and daily depopulations, it made these people for their own safety, advise together concerning the choosing  accepting of Princes, which they did by the name of E or Counts, who at first were bound to observe their dutie with so much strictness to the French, and afterwards to the Emperours of Germany, that they had no Lawes of their own distinct: Very uncertain it is, of what House sprung or  what Antiquity their first Princes were; There is an Opi∣nion vulgarly received, that they were sent out of Acq∣tayne; but there are better and stronger proofs, that the were Natives, who of old in the same place, now known b the name of Holland, had but narrow limits to their Dom∣nion, till by little and little, they became so much inlarge as they have been, while by Claims from the Female it had severally descended unto the Lords of Henalt, Bavaria, Bur∣gundy and Austria; of which last is come King Philip the Second, but in the number of Earls is reckoned the one and thirtieth. At this time the greatest difficulty and evill that attended the Warre, was that Amsterdam in Holland, and Middleburg in Zeland, two most flourishing Cities, were both repugnan to all the undertakings of both these Provinces; their big∣ness making them beyond Command of the yongling Com∣mon-wealth, especially because all Alva's care was fixe
for their preservation, not onely placing in them choyce Governours, but strong Garisons of Souldiers. On the other side, the Isle of Bommell, belonging to Geldres, encompassed by the Rivers Wale and Maze, was drawn into the associati∣on, and fortified for the defence of Holland: Certainly, there was not any thing could have fallen out more happily to the management of these Affairs, then the coming of the Prince of Aurange; for he being well skilled in what was necessa∣ry for a good Government, made a quiet settlement of what∣ever was out of order, and by discretion, and his innate mo∣deration, kept their strength together, which otherwise would have quickly come to nothing, which vertues his very ene∣mies applauded in him; for Marquius, while he managed the Government of Holland in his absence, by his cruelty towards Priests, and all other kinds of immodesty, had brought a great scandall upon their now growing Liberty, for being of a cruel nature himself, he spurred on the French, who being accustomed to blood and licentiousness, reven∣ged the evills, which they escaped at home, in forraign Ser∣vice: for this Cause, as also, for some Act of disobedience, by the Prince of Aurange his Command, he is suddenly taker, and accusations framed against him; but the times would not permit him to have any further punishment. But the Prince of Aurange laying aside his Name of Prince, and embracing his Power, began, with a selected Counsel, to bestow Commands, set forth Lawes and Constitutions, to order and direct the Affaires relating to the Warre, both by Sea and Land; and in brief, to settle all things in the Com∣mon-wealth; and if any matter of greater moment then ordi∣nary fell out, it was taken into consideration by the great As∣semby of the States, among whom he sate President. Whose frequent meetings, besides the shew of a popular State, were very advantageous in this, that more of the whole number might be knit together by parts; & to that end, where before onely six Cities of Holland, together with the Nobility, did
consult of most matters; which six Cities were, Dordrecht, Harlem, Delfe, Leyden, Amsterdam and Gaunte, now the Prince of Aurange did admit of twelve more less Towns, which without doubt would be faithful to him, by whose fa∣vour they had obtained the Priviledge of a Suffrage: Not truly was it without great foresight, that these were made Partners in Counsels, in regard they would the more willing∣ly help to bear that burthen, of whose use and necessity themselves were Judges; their Names and Order follow thus. In the South part, Rotterdam, Gorrichm, Scydam, Schon∣houen; and in the Isle of Maze, Brill. In the North, Alema Horne, Enchaysen; and also in the Marshes there, which a called Waterland, Edam and Monkedam, and not far thence Medemleke, and Purmeren: In the place of them that refu∣sed to come, by publick Judgement and Choyce, he appoint∣ed other Substitutes. There was a great scarcity of men, that did either desi or deserve these savours, when most of them, seeing the smallness of their strength, or out of scruple of Conscience would endeavour to exempt themselves from these matter which seemed to them troublesome and unsafe: And tha they might avoid the Odium of falling rashly from their obe∣dience, being underpropped by no allyance, the name  Phillip is used in all Cases, though positively in opposition to Philips Commands; Nor wanted they a President for this even from the Spaniards themselves, who being beyond mea∣sure oppressed with Taxes, when the Emperour Charles was gone into Germany, opposed the Kings Deputies, or V∣roys. By such and the like practices did the Germans at f strengthen and associate themselves in the Smalcalde Leagy for the Cause of Religion; After whom, the French Nobi∣lity had by many Writings declared, that inferior Magi∣strates did not falsifie their Allegiance, when they fight fo
the defence of Religion, and the Laws, and to Protect the lives of Innocents, although therein they not onely disobey the Kings Command, but resist his Person. This did in some small measure help the Nassavians, because they took Arms against Alva, the King being absent, which they would have let alone, if he had been there; But they, who, in defence of the Kings Power and Greatness, boasted, that they would lay down their lives, were, by a more fatall necessity, compel∣led not onely to bear Arms, but to fight many bloody Battels against the same. Now were the Roman Ceremonies quite cast out of their Churches, and who were of that Judgement, were not easily admitted unto any great Offices or Imployments; not that there was any Law against them, but it was so ordered cut of common Prudence, least they bearing a grudge to all that dissented from them, might, by that Licence, probably dis∣joyn and seperate their own from the publick Cause, and the Discipline which was taught at Geneva, and here and there dispersedly in the Palatinate of Germany, was publickly re∣ceived and owned; but with this difference, that many of the same Religion vary in the toleration of divers things; for the teachers in this say, not onely that Cities and Magi∣strates were ordained of God, for prevention of injuries, either to mens Persons or Estates, but that he commanded in what manner he would be worshipped; but that saith, it is enough to worship at large; of which duty, many being neg∣ligent, had drawn upon themselves the punishments due for the impieties of other men. But on the contrary, those people judged it not onely fit to give them all ayd, but all of the Religion voluntarily did abhorre the very name of the Laws of the Inquisition; and from thenceforth did dispute, that no man would willingly go astray, neither could any man be forced to believe against his will; And that a true opinion in matters of Religion, was onely by God infused into the minds of men; no devotion being acceptable to
him, but what is voluntary. And that it hath been found true, that erroneous opinions have not been stifled so well by force and humane Laws, as eaten out by length and process of time; Under these pretences and vizors, not onely the publick Rites of Religion were despised without punish∣ment, but sometimes absurd and impious discourses would be published among these evills of too much liberty. Now were the Tributes and Revenues of the Prince, Priests and Monasteries, together with the Estates of all such as were fled, and lived in the Enemies Country, and also all Prizes taken at Sea, brought into a common Treasury for the publick use. 1573. Then were found out the severall names of Taxes imposed on mens Heads and Estates; then were invented exactions under the names of Loanes, and Impositions laid, even on those things which were consumed by use; and all these increased more and more, as the Warre grew more fierce. They bore so great a spleen against Tyrannical So∣veraignty, that they had rather part with all, then pay the Tenth before spoken of. There was also found out a new way of gaining from the Enemy, which by selling Licences, that Provisions, and other Commodities might be transported; and this profitable Custom is used yet, both publickly and privately; and though many times forbidden, yet never left off. There was somewhat also payd out of Merchandizes, for Ships of Convoy, when Merchants Ships were attended at Sea for their security by Ships of Warre. All these things thus setled, the lack of money notwithstanding was the main matter; because the Spaniards might make incursions into the Hollanders Country, first by Ʋtrecht and Amsterdam and then through Narde, (for that is the way ut of Geller∣land.) Most matters were atchieved by the valour and indu∣stry of the Citizens, not by hired and forraign Souldiers; for there was hardly Provision enough for those already in Ser∣vice:
The Captains were yet not skilled in managing their Men, and the Men were untoward to be commanded: This onely helped them, that they had as much skill in the as∣saulting and taking of Towns, as their Enemy: Hence it proceeded, that Sieges became so long, and the main force they used, was to starve the Enemy out; till by many slaugh∣ters and wounds, they became more expert, having out of each others blood learned perfectly the art of Warre. Great was the over-sight of Alva, that he did not bend all his force against Zeland, in the instant, while all things were discomposed and out of order; but he was frighted by them, as being ignorant of the way of such fights. The Spanish Army lay seven moneths about Harlem, a City of Holland, loosing many thousands of their men, as well by the sharpness of the Winter, as by the Sword: and that time both strengthned and confirmed the minds of men, and the State of Affairs; and though by a long Siege, yet at last, after a late and unhappy relief, the besieged fell into the cruel hands of their enemies; a great part of whom they either hanged or drowned: But by this it appeared, that it was impossible to overcome them, who had been so long getting a Victory; and least their Successes should have gone on, while the amazement for the late loss continued, their own dissertions put an obstacle in the way, by a mutiny for want of pay: which was an unavoydable evill in those parts, though in wages under a most wealthy King. By the sufferings and punishments of the Inhabitants of Harlem, the Peoples rage was again set on fire, in which fu∣ry, Alemar, a Town of Holland, lying to the North, first made a breach upon the Spaniards strength, by beating them off from their Siege; and afterwards, they received more comforts in their misery, for the Nassavians took Geretruy∣denburgh by force, a Town of Holland, extending it self to Brabant, and Bossu himself, with his whole Fleet, was taken, while, both at Sea and Land, he daily did infest West-Frize∣land
with Warre. The Spaniards had given this Fleet, the name of the Praetorian Inquisition, arrogantly thereby hind with scorn at the Cause of the Warre. Alva now grown old, and solicitous to preserve his fam upon his humble Request in that behalf made to Philip, is b him recalled, perceiving that his violent proceedings di little good, and that as long as his memory remained,  would be an obstacle to any other meanes that should be  sed, without any notice taken of his desire, that his Son might succeed him, who was partaker as well of the hatred con∣tracted against his Father, as of his actions. 1574. Five years and a little more, he governed here being wont to boast, that in that time, he had caused the ex∣ecution and slaughter of eighteen thousand men: His Acts especially that for the Tenth, the King durst neither openly approve and confirm it, nor positively repeal it. He remained in the Court, without any question, and with Honour, until after some years, he was, together with his Son, who had com∣mitted a Rape upon a Noble Virgin, thrown into Prison, whence he did not get free untill the Portugall Warre re∣quired the presence of an expert and knowing Captain. Lewis de Requesens, was sent to succeed him in the Go∣vernment of the Netherlands, who insnared divers by cun∣ning and more remiss dealings; Liberall and milde beyond the Spanish guise, but nothing so subtle as Alva. He was no quite ignorant in Military Affairs, as witnessed that famous Victory obtained at the Echinades, in the Honour whereof he had a great share; and his bringing under of Granado, and breach of promise there with his enemies, when they grum∣bled against the Inquisition, the same whereof went before him; but the first thing by which he endeavoured to get the favour of the Netherlanders was, the pulling down Alva's Statue. About this time, Middleburg, by a long Famine, which did almost afflict the Beiegers as besieged, and the Spanish
Fleet being broken and vanquished in many sharp Conflicts, surrendred to the Zlanders, and regained thereby her wast∣ed Wealth. But Lewis of Nassau, endeavouring to draw the Enemy off from Holland, was slain near Nimmeghen, toge∣ther with the Troops which he brought to his Brother, which did happen by the folly of the Souldiers; for just as the E∣nemy was upon them with drawn Swords, they began im∣portunately to cry out to their Captain for money. This was the end of that Captain, who, both for Valour and Policy, might be ranked among the most prayse-worthy; as also of his Brother Henry, and Christopher, Son of the Prince Palatine. The same mischief, which had been the ruine of these, fell upon the Conquerour's Army; for they likewise began to mutiny against their Officers, and to command their pay, the wages due for their blood. This madness fell upon Antwerp, a City of Brabant, most happy in times of peace, in the enjoyment of a great Trade by Merchants, and the acquiring of what naturally flowes thence, Wealth, which is the whole work of Peace, while on the contrary, where Warre hath once given a liberty to all things, the basest poverty cannot sometimes secure her raggs; here did they insult by all meanes, till by force and threats, they extorted from the Citizens there four hundred thousand Florens: which it was thought, Don Requesens was well enough content with, because he Commanded they should not be resisted or denyed. And in a very short time after, he granted them a generall Pardon, rejoycing as it were, that money was any way gotten, though it was not im∣probable he might have had it willingly, if he had but de∣manded it; for while the States of those parts refused to pay any Taxes toward the Warre, unless the Tenth might be ta∣ken away by a solemn Edict, it happened, that either by the Kings obstinacy, or the Governours, their Designs in both were frustrated. Which covetousness of Reward, or rather
indeed over-pay is greater among the Spaniard, than an other Nation almost: For this, they will mutiny in a mo notorious manner; and yet, as it were by a certain Pre∣dence, still stick to the King's Interest. Thus by an under∣hand Confederacy of the Commanders, they fall to pla Robbery, which the Souldier calls his Wages, or Hire, and the People name it Necessity: Neither were these Sub∣ties here first used; for in others Wars it had been custom a with the Spaniard to use the same Trade. This Violence and Injury, had mightily turned the Lo of the People to the Prince of Aurange; and th at the next following Council among them,1575. made his Requests, and their Desires, to be as it were  one; for they began to mention a Treaty of Peace before Al∣degondius, who was a Prisoner, (but a man of great Learning and Ingenuity, and withall very intimate and prevalent with the Prince of Aurange) whom they would send with L∣ters to that purpose, associated with Campigny; between whom, and his Brother Granvel, there was a Domestical Quar∣rel, and such an Enmity, as in like Cases uses to be between Relations: At last, the Legates on both sides met at Br∣da, whither the Emperour sent Count Suartzburge, a Kins∣man of the Prince of Aurange, to be a Moderator between both Parties. The Prince of Aurange, and they who were under his Authority, had given these Instructions; That they were ac∣counted, without desert, Rebels and irreligious Persons, by their Enemies; for that they understood the Nature of their Duty, both to God and their Prince; That they had never taken up Arms against Philip; and that the onely cause, that hindred the Peace, was, that they were governed by Strangers; And that if the Spa∣nish Souldiers might be removed away, which was very necessa∣ry, both as to Matters of Religion, and all other things; that they would Declare themselves satisfied, by the Judgment of all the States of the Netherlands.
Hereto it was answered, That they had not well done, chis∣sing rather to stand upon their own Defence, than to submit them∣selves; That yet they should have free Pardon and Impunity, so as the Disturbers of Religion, might, within a time limited, be Ba∣nished the Country: for they conceived unjust, that so great a King should be denyed the Power to settle Religion, which to the petty Princes of Germany was never scrupled; And as to the rest, that the King would willingly agree, so as they would first deliver up to him the Cities and Castles; as also all things, with their Furniture, and other Engines and Provisions of War, which they now had in their Possession. These Conditions were not at all pleasing, as being more rigorous than they could inforce by Arms; whereupon they desired a Truce, that Acts of Hostility might cease, and that for some years there might be a Toleration of Religi∣on: But neither could this be obtained; yet Requesens, by a few late Successes, being more than ordinarily puffed up, prolonged the Treaty, that in the mean time, he might the more easily get an opportunity to do them a mischief, while they yet neglected, and thought nothing of War: For at this very time, wherein they were Treating of Peace, the Spanish Armies had strange and strong Designs on foot, which in some places succeeded well, by reason of unexpected Celerity; but in other, were with admirable Valour and Resolution, broken and brought to nothing: As particularly, in West-Frizeland, where several Companies of the King's Souldiers making Inroads, the Country People meeting them disper∣sed up and down, which hapned by their ignorance of the Places and Wayes, took, and without mercy killed them: In this variety of Affairs, the Siege of Leyden, begun before, continued a little while, making all things tremble for fear; for the Spaniards were then in the very Heart of Holland, nor had they any Forces to resist them, but onely relyed upon the Divine Help, and the never-to-be-reconciled Hatred of the People, against this Treacherous and Tyrannical Govern∣ment;
which in this troublesome time appeared so evident that there was a Sea-man, or Marriner found, who have torn a Spaniards Heart out of his Body, bit the same in pie with his Teeth: Therefore, after they had quite wearied o their Hope, and Famine as yet had wrought nothing up them, many of them being consumed, either by the Sword Sickness, according to the Example of Modena, the Besiege making use of Birds for Messengers, digging through the Fortifications, opening the Banks of their Rivers, and so le∣ting the Sea overflow the Land; which hapning at a Full Moon, made the Water rise much higher, the Wind also won∣derfully favouring the Design, they preserved themselves Nay, the Ruinousness of their Walls, which to other Ci is a great Evil, was an Advantage to this, thereby the No of a great Eruption coming to their Enemies Ears, which both frighted and deceived them. The Siege being thus raised from Leyden, and the Souldier taking with them one Baldes, a Captain whom they had ta∣ken, coming to Utrecht a City of their Party, which they h destined to be a Prey to them, under the pretence of a Mu∣tiny, they were over-master'd in their Design, and beu from their Assault. Then the Spaniard attempted to bre into Holland, on the left side, by the Maze, and the Leck, where having taken some Towns on the Banks thereof, a∣mong which Oudwater, (so the Town is named) the Noble Victor shewed his Cruelty: Nor could they be repressed or beaten back, untill they had harrased even to a place cal∣led Coblente, near which there is a Village named Cry∣pen. At the same time also, Peter Melendes a Biscayan, the Con∣queror of Florida; but by a most villainous piece of Treache∣ry, and infamous amongst his own Countrey-men, when he had with little Judgment compared the American and Ne∣therlandish Affairs, boasted, that he would easily bring both Brill, and other Ports, into their subjection: And now some
ships being made ready, an Embassie was sent into England, to desire the Friendship of their Shore, and Entertainment, f their Fleet should chance to be driven thither, by any Im∣petousity of the Winds or Seas, But a suddain Contagious Disease scattered their Mariners, and the Captain himself being told of the Vanity of his promised Undertaking, dyed, as many think, for shame, but more for fear: And the Spa∣niards that had been drawn together, being by the Hollan∣ders Forces dispersed, and their ships destroyed, that kept Guard at Antwerp, and a new Face of Affairs presently fol∣lowing, made them lay aside their Sea-Coast Design for many years. After this, the Requesenians enter an Isle of Zeland, called Schouvum (of old Scaldia) in the Confines of Holland, and is so named from the River that runs by the left side of it, by ships partly, and partly through the Fords; but whether with more Fortune or Courage, is more questionable: However, they, to make the Action more famous, feigned Mira∣cles (such as they had heard mentioned in old Wives Tales) giving out, that the very Stars gave more Light than ordinary, to guide them while they went abroad. Here winning by As∣sault, the Port of Bommenede, which was a place kept by a small Garrison, after a valiant Defence, they afterward get into their Power, by a Nine Moneths Siege, Zyrixee, the chief Town of the Island. To this grievous Mischief, of having an Enemy in the midst of two Provinces united by League, and they both in want of Men and Money to repell them, was added another, as great as the former; and that was, That they did in vain pray the Aid and Friendship of Forreign Princes; Either for that the Example did not please them, or else because they stood in fear of the Spanish Power: For the Queen of England, refused either to make a League with them, or to take the Soveraignty over them, which they offer'd her, it belonging to anoher; although they boasted, Her Alliance in Bloud to the former Princes and Rulers of Holland,
and that they had but one common Religion, and that she was s Lady and Mistress of the Sea. Yet all this notwithstanding she supplyed them with Money sometimes, but for what the asked unseasonably, it might rather turn to their greater Da∣mage. Henry, the Brother of Charles, was then King of France, who well knowing before the Spanish Treacheries, and in∣tending to meet him in the like sort, was pleased to ass those who endeavoured to break his strength, but with a privacy possibly imaginable; wherein is not to be so gotten the Subtilty of that almost Piratical Invention, by which is was agreed with the King, That the Nassauian Treasure of Warre at Calais, a City of France, should sell Commissi∣ons, or Licenses, to sail in the Neighbouring Sea, to get Re∣stitution for the Injuries, suffered by both People; and what was so gotten, they might freely sell there: for hitherto, whe∣ther they went with any Prey gotten from the Hollanders, either to their Enemies, or elsewhere; yet they were brought to Tryals and Examinations, and many times were forced to run the hazard of a Damageable Suit before strange Judges▪ And the Covenant of preventing Danger (commonly called Insurance) frequent among Merchants, added a Shadow of Law; whereby the incertainty of the Event is usually trans∣ferred to another, with some certain Reward. And the Mo∣ney growing from this one Tribute, was not much inferior to the great Expences of the Warre; unless the whole Ro of Sea-men, a sort of Creatures to be kept under by Laws, should return to their old Liberty, and take their proper pro∣fit out of all Prizes: This unexpected good Fortune, re∣stored Vigour to their Affairs, which were almost grown de∣sperate, when by a suddain Disease Requesens cies; by which the Administration of the Government did revert into the Senate of those Parts, under the King's Dominion. Joa∣chi Hopper a Frison, whose Power, being then an Agent in Spain, did increase; because Counsels by him rejected and
disallowed, had ill succeeded; so that, though a Netherlan∣der, he had gained the Name and Repute of a Wise, in the esteem of the Spaniards, thought that would be pleasing to the People, for the retaining of those they already had, and for the pacifying of those that were fallen off: But no man was ever so wise, whom Fortune at one time or other hath not deceived: For the Prince of Aurange had before this, by under-hand Policies, and insinuating Intelligence, gain'd the Hearts of the Brabanders, declaring, That he desired no∣thing, that might singly tend to his own particular advantage, but wholly minded the Publike Good. And they again, of their own accord, consented, while Requesens was busie abroad with his Forces, or dissembled Lenity, with intent, to raise his Authority higher than he had ever abated it: For the Re∣gent himself very indiscretly commanded the Countrey∣men to take Arms, to repress the Tumultuous Mutinies of the Souldiers; which very thing, was the first beginning of their Liberty in thoe Parts: For now the Names imposed by Alva being forgotten, the Laws, and the Rights of the States, were cryed up by the Voyces of all Men: Flanders also from hence learned Wit, a People very unquiet, and hardly able of old to endure their Princes, when they were onely Princes. These confidently denied Tribute to Don Requesens, be∣cause there was exacted from them, more than was necessa∣ry: But as there were in that Senate some Spaniards; so were there also many Netherlanders, from whom the Prince of Aurange hoped, that he might desire, that they would rather bestow those Monies to defend their Country, than betray it. And this Counsel, so full of sound Care, did greatly help forward in that Case: For this War had so extreamly drained the Spanish Wealth, though very great, that the King being greatly indebted, was fain to take by force his Pos∣sessions from the Ʋsurers, under the pretence of a general Discharge, by common Authority, of all Debts and Bonds
before that time, without any payment or satisfaction for the same. And by chance, the Turks (whose Power hath ever grown greater by the Christians Discords) while Philip turns all his strength against the Netherlands, enjoying the Kingdom of Tunis, fell violently into all the rest of Africa, both by Sea and Land, which the Spaniards held: By means of which straits, it came to pass, that the Spanish Souldiers in the Low-Countries, had no Pay for many Moneths; who thereupon according to Custom by them long received, ca∣sting off Obedience, become Licentious, and wish for nothing more than for Pillage: Wherefore Bruxels, the Me∣tropolis of those Dominions, was destined for Plunder, and so had been, if the common People, mindful of former Vil∣lanies, and almost astonished at the greatness of the immi∣nent Danger, had not betaken them to Arms, and advertised the Magistrates, and those who had the Management of the Laws thereof: These presently summoned the Senate, to whom, we told you before, the Administration of the Go∣vernment was fallen, to condemn these impudent Souldi∣ers, as Enemies to the Prince and Country; which being o∣penly done, the Sedition was believed to be privily foment∣ed by the Counsels of a few, whose Wealth grew from For∣reign Tyranny. But when the Confederate Regiments, turning out their Commanders, had forcibly entred Alost, a Town in that part of Flanders, which of old stuck to the German Empire, and was never, as the rest, subject to France, and thence had wa∣sted the Country round about them, there being none to take Vengeance of them; some of the Nobles of Brabant, not by any publike Advice, but struck with the Fear and Memory of the Example of Antwerp, sent some who should keep toge∣ther the Senate, (that is, the Head of the Commonwealth) in their Court and Session. Anon, least the Government should fail, for want of a lawful Authority, they discriminated the Innocent from such as were Suspicious, restraining all whose
Treachery or Sluggishness would produce the effect, that no Strength should be made ready against the insulting Envy and Malice of the Spaniards: And not onely so, but the Na∣tives that were Souldiers, were, as much as might be, picked out, and sent into several parts, and then joyned in League with Flanders, and other Cities, against them, as against a Common Enemy. Nor did they onely think of these new Di∣sturbances of the Publike Peace; but called also to  the Oppressions in Alva's time, such as the Tenths, Inquisition, Punishments of the Guiltless,, Robbing them of that by Force and War, which they laboured for in Times of Peace, and their frequent Slaughters and Executions, by colour of the E∣dicts. And now Matters began to seem not onely to take notice of such as had traduced the Government, but of the whole Spanish Nation: Whereupon, one Rode made himself Cap∣tain of certain Companies of Spaniards, that now went out of Holland, never to return thither again; part of the Senate before, and which then was gone over to the Souldiers usup∣ing to themselves all Right of Government: But now he whole Colledge as it were re-uniting; The German Souldiers too joyned themselvs, hoping to do what they listed; &  thus joyned together, they sacked Ʋtrecht by he Maze,  most noble City, and not long after, powering themselves out of the Castle into the City of Antwerp; where, for some days, having beaten out the Defendants, they glutted their Wrath and Avarice with the Slaughter o the Townsmen, the burning of Houses, and an exceeding great Booty. Among all which Mseries, the Netherlanders durst not rely upon the strength and valour of their new and unexperienced Soul∣diers against those Weather-beaten and old ones, who had also Fortifications and Castles: not knowing well therefore what to do, and considering, that it would be too tedious to ove oher Princes to aid them, they resolved at last to accept of the next Forces, which belonged to the Prince of Aurange,
& were by him freely offered them, being conscious to them∣selves, that they should be looked upon however, as guilty of the like Crimes, and that they must either purge themselves together by Force, or suffer together: Wherefore, resuming the Treaty of Peace, which was broken off at Breda, as is be∣fore related, and as Fellow-Citizens, consulting against a Common Enemy, they easily agree; and it was provided, that for the obliterating the Memory of former Differences, no one should be questioned concerning Religion, nor that any Judgments should be confirmed, which were given con∣cerning the same, but that all things confiscated, should be re∣stored to their Owners; or if they were sold, certain select Apprizers should set a value both upon Possessions, and other things wrongfully detained, and to restore to the one the thing it self, to wit, the Possessions; to the other, the value or price thereof, that every one for the future might use what Religion he pleased; and so as to those things, which they of Holland and Zealand took, detained in the time of the War, which belonged to the King; and they also agreed, That what Money the Prince of Aurange had expended in his two Ex∣peditions, or so much thereof as belonged to him, the rest of the Provinces should be equally contributary to the re-imbursing, after the Commonwealth was freed from Forreigners, according to the Judgment of the General States of the Netherlands. In the in∣terim, Trading should be incouraged, both Parties should use the present Form of Jurisdiction, and the Religions they already hold; And that it should not be lawful for the Hollanders, or their As∣sociates, to alter any thing in Religion, without their own Bounds; onely granting the Prince of Aurange Power of ordering the Ci∣ties belonging to his particular Government. Upon these Agreements, a Peace was concluded at Gaunt▪ between the Nassauian Party, and the People of Brabant, Flanders, Artoys, Henault, and other Provinces, onely Lut∣zenburge excepted, whose Governours were privately obe∣dient and affectionate to the Name of Spaniard, and the Peo∣ple
ever most firm in their Fidelity to their Princes: But the Frisons came in, having imprisoned their Governour Caspar Roblese a Portugeze, because he resisted them. Thus thowing down the Castles every where, they threw off their Yoke of Slavery: And because Antwerp, being possessed by the Spaniards, hindred the mutual Commerce of the Provinces, they made great Banks of Defence near the Sceld, that under their Safeguard ships might pass safely. Afterwards, this League was entred into again at Bruxels, and the Agreement of War against the Spaniards,1577. confirmed by the Oath of the Clergy, Nobility, and Com∣mons, and fully assented to by the Senate. And this was the onely time, from whence any one might with Reason, hope well of the Low-Country Affairs, if they had laid aside their Feuds, as well as their Arms: And, to speak clearly, the Emulation and Ambition of the Lords, was the undoubted Fountain of all their Evils; and the Fault of the People was not much unlike this, for such was their Frantick Zeal in their Religion, that they would never stick to any Agree∣ments or Covenants, nor be contented with their present Condition; and while these Vices keep their Footing, there will never be Person; nor Instruments wanting to undermine Liberty. Therefore King Philip, when these Conditions were brought to him, being informed, that they were approved by the ge∣neral Consent of all, and that they would have Forreign Aid, if he should continue to deal harshly with them, thought it fit to yield to Necessity; and so making a Law in confirmation of the said League and Agreements, in the mean while, un∣der-hand, he determines to wait all Opportunities, either to break, or at least distract this Alliance, and kept the Prince of Aurange's Son, who, according to the said League, ought to have been set at Liberty, as an Hostage for his Fathers Actions.
Now is Don John of Austria, base Son of the Emperour Charles, sent Governour into the Low-Countries, that so, be∣ing a young man of a sharp Wit, famous for a Sea-fight against the Turks, and high in the Pope's Favour, he might divert his Mind from the thought of higher things: And this also he pretended he did, to shew his Intent, for the future, of maintaining the Laws, when he sent one so near to him by Bloud, to govern them: And indeed, in publike, he would own nothing, that might seem to intrench on the Peace, though privately he commanded, to follow Rode's Counsel, who was (as we before declared) the Leader in the Spanish Sedition: But not cunning enough, to conceal these Matters long, for the Hatred which he had drawn upon himself, the impatien∣cy of the Age, together wih some intercepted Letters, made publike the most secret of all their Counsels and Designs: Which the Prince of Aurange consideing, and earnest that Extreams might not damnitie so increasing Fortune; be counselled the Netherlanders, that weighing how much they had offened Philip, in the Peace they had made, they should by War keep out, that manifest Officer of his Wrath, while yet he was without strength, and upon their Borders. This was gain-said by many of the prime Nobility, that did not hear∣tily love the Prince of Aurange, either out of an old Grudge, or for some new sprung Envy; many in this Tempest of Af∣fairs, who were by Advice in ermingled in general Parties, for Reverence of the Prince, continued in their Arms, under the pretence of Necessity to defend themselves. Thus Peace being made, in a Town of Lutzenburge, call'd Marsa, the Government was granted to Don John of Austria, if he would first Disband, and send away the Spanish, and then all other Forreign Souldiers; although the Hollanders, and all that of their Party, did earnestly labour the contra∣ry. All fear was now banished, and an incredible joy sur∣prized the hearts of all, because the Spanish Army was by
Covenant to go out of their Cities, although carrying with it many barbarous spoyls, and the Rapines of ten years; and boasting, that within the last six moneths, they had killed thirty thousand Netherlanders, of the meaner sort question∣less, when they denyed, that within the same time, that they had lost above threescore; nor were they long gone, or far, some of them being stayd at Millayne, and others nearer, till Don John might recall them to a War prepared for them; For this Austrian being received into the Government, with the highest Honour possible, but youthfully impatient of all delay, suddenly besets the entrances of the Country, and in short time breaks through them, taking Namur, and some o∣ther Towns on that Border; and further, solicites the Ger∣man Bands, which were not yet gone out of the Netherlands, for want of their pay, to render up the Cities they were in: and their treachery was easie enough to be wrought on; But, whether they were either frighted with threats, or tempted with promises, the dulness of their Spirits, or flexibleness of their Natures, quickly broke off their design. By this meanes, most of Brabant was preserved, the Soul∣diers not onely delivering the Garrisons into the power of the States, but their Commanders also; the Embassadors of the Provinces at the General Council, used the name of the States, to whom, after the Power of the Regall Senate was abolished, most of the business of the Common-wealth was brought; And yet there was no War, but the States did ac∣cuse Don John to the King and other Princes, that he had pub∣lickly broken the Peace: He again casts the blame upon the Prince of Aurange, hat he would set up new Customs, con∣trary to the Covenants of the League in the Cities, which subjected to his Dominion, by Contracts and Agreements. Notwithstanding which Calumnies, he was by all the Cities of the Netherlands, looked upon with an high esteem, as the Authour of their liberty, and of such a noble disposition, as is wont to win all mens affections. He strengthned by com∣placence,
that power which he would seem to diminish, so great was his prudence and moderation; and because by di∣ligent inquiries and pains, and by intercepted Letters, he had demonstrated, that the Austrian Snares were laid first for him, and his, and afterwards for all the rest, by breaking the Band of the League; he so won the favour of all the people, that he was by the Brabanders chosen to be their Governour. This was taken very ill by Arscot, who at that time, was President of Flanders, Lalayne, Champigny, and divers others, who could not digest that the chief management of all Af∣faires should rest in the Prince of Aurange, with whom few were equall in birth, none of them like him in Wisdom and Authority. Therefore because they see themselves never able to compass the Peoples love, as he hath done, and that they must come far short of him, they begin to fear, that if he should come to enjoy, that Dignity, that he would bring Religion to his own bent; and to prevent that, they seek to prevent his glory, by the splendor of a greater name. Rodolphus was chosen Emperour of Germany, in the stead of Maximilian his Father who was lately dead: His Brother Matthias, they by many great promises, intreat from the Court, not by any open consent of the Emperor, for fear of offending the Spaniard. The'e men, because they had strong Cities and Arms in their power, imagined they could easily bring to passe, that by their bringing in of this young man, who must be beholding to them for that great Honour, they should have all things in their power, and might in his name execute their own Commands, and do what they list all which, the Prince of Aurange foreseeing, he removed some of these guilty persons from, that Council, and assured them, that they might more confidently hope for a just Government in the lawful Dominion of the States, than the particular power of some few. And by chance also at this time it fortuned, that Arscot, the chief Emulator of the
House of Nassau, swolne big with vain hope, offended the Commonalty of Gaunt, by some insolent Speeches; the people of which City, being the most noble of all Flanders, but the most averse to Nobility, threw him and all his Train into Custody. But the Prince of Aurange, although Matthias was called in by his Enemies, and had come contrary to his desire, and that the rest of the Netherlanders had a greater re∣spect towards France, yet having regard to the moderation of his Carriage, he himself moved the States, that they would accept the young man, eminent in his Brothers Majesty, and of Kindred to the King, to protect their Cause; wherewith they were thus far pleased, that the Government of the Ne∣therlands should be in Matthias, but that the Prince of Au∣range should be Deputy Governour, which at length, though unwillingly, he accepted; by which means, their fury, who had sought out Matthias, onely with hope to have made themselves great by his Dignity, was more enflamed. The Regency of Matthias, is bounded and limited by Laws and Counsellors: nor had he power to use any thing suitable to his greatness, besides the State and splendor of his life. The third Book of the Dutch Annals. ALL matters being in this manner setled, Warre is proclaimed against Don John, at which time, the Monethly Revenues arising from Provisions of Victuals, amounting to six hundred thousand Florens, was brought into the publick Treasury; the free disposing where∣of, as also of Musters and Councels relating to the Warre, that they might be the freer from discovery, were by the States, left wholly to the Senate. Then at length, the Queen
of England began to think the forces of the Netherlanders worthy of her favour, though yet she was not without a pe∣culiar fear of troubles in her own State, because Don John moved a Marriage with the Queen of Scots, by which, and the help of his Arms, he hoped to get to himself the King∣dom of Britain, and this was evident by no small demonstra∣tions; wherefore she promised them both men and money, for their assistance, they giving caution for repayments; but yet still they should stick to their pretence, that the Nether∣landers Provinces would be obedient to Philip. And so she interwove her self into that Common-wealth, that no matter of any importance, could be done without her knowledge and approbation, endeavouring also to strengthen these new Settlements by an universal Concord, (though some of the Netherlanders laboured earnestly, but in vain, to provoke the Queen against the Prince of Aurange;) and perswading now one, now another, by laying before them the greatness of the danger, least they should incline to re-settle the old Possessi∣on of the Roman Religion, She therefore would give them ayd. When She had effected these things, She sends Letters to the King, desiring him therein to hearken to peace, and to moderate his Government by the Rule of the Law; but if he would compel his Subjects to take Arms, he should not take it ill at her hands, the French long since being intent thereto, if she prevented the Dutch allyance with that People who were her Enemies; and in the interim, she did with great pains strive to clear her self from affecting the Soveraignty that belonged to another. Henry King of France, Sebastian King of Portugall, and the Emperour himself, were, in like manner, solicited by the States, to move Philip to moderation towards them, the last also being sed to for assistance in their Cause, which at that time was in vain; In the interim private grudgings and dis∣cords, increased among the great Ones, so that many went
thence into Castles, and strong Holds scituate in Lutzenburg, upon various pretences; but the true cause was, they inter∣preted, the Honours given to others, to be an affront and disparagement to them. But Don John, being recruited with the coming of the Spanish Forces, and a great many Compa∣nies of Souldiers brought to him by the Duke of Parma, the Son of Margaret, late Governess of the Netherlands, out of Italy,1578. overthrew the Dutch Army, which was daily weakened by the going away of their Captains, and retreating into Brabant, at a place called Gemblim. Nor was the Prey gotten by the Victory small, especially, if we consider it in the success, because Lovayne, which layd open Brabant on that side Limburg, a famous Dutchy, and the Metropolis of the Dominion, bearing the same name, using to make excursions even into Germany and Phillippolis, which City, the Prince of Aurange, when formerly he was Gene∣rall of the Kings Army, had fortified with new and strong Bulwarks against the French, when onely forraign Warres were feaed; as also many other adjacent Towns, came in and submitted. The King having hus conquered them, yet thought fit to try them with the hope of Peace, the Baron Selles carrying Conditions out of Spain, for differing from those made at Gaunt, and for which Don John would not alter a tittle, which then was enough to make it seem resonable why they should be denyed; for now the Netherlanders began first to know themselves, and several Princes did augment their con∣fidence, by striving who should first offer them Souldiers and other ayd: Here Francis of Valoys, Duke of Anjon, and Bother to the King of France, both before the Peace made at Gaunt, and after, was often sued to by the Belgick Nobles. There Casimire, who possessed the Palatinate of Germany; both of them by reason of thei yonger Birth, being laid side at hoe, and therefore the more desirous to augment both their Fame and Wealth by forraign Service and acquisitions
Francis, who was of a disposition not to be despised, but altogether unrestful in spirit, offered himself to be their Ge∣nerall in the Warre, which was said in France, to be for the restoring of liberty, against the wrongs and oppressions of the Court, and for the settlement of Religion in peace; which he did either out of hatred to his Brother, who, though weak and barren, yet kept the Kingdom, or else he was an Instru∣ment of his Mothers subtilty; for averting the feuds of par∣ties; and surely he might have gained the love of the People very much in the supporting that Cause, and would, upon a Peace made, have had most ample possessions. But he be∣coming the Minister of anothers cruelty, in a short time soyl∣ed all his Renown by turning his Arms upon his Allyes. About which , Margaret of Valoyes, the King of Na∣varres Wife, that she might be clear of the Warres of her Husband, and her Brother, and veyling the desire of her ab∣sence, with the pretence of going to the Waters at the Spaw, as she passed by Cambray and Moniz, taking hold of oppor∣tunity, She highly commended the Duke of Anjou, in those two strong places, that differed not much either in Customs or Speech from the French, and very little in Religion; But Casimire, who had at that time been a great support to the party of Navarre, remitted the Agreement that privately had been made with him, thereby giving the testimony of a just and Religious mind. The Common-wealth, like an indigested Chaos, was now on every side in confusion, nor was there any Symmetry in its parts, while each one catches at the Government, as if it were void, and in the prosecuting thereof, steer a severall way; And truly, the main use of Arms by all, was against a Kingdom; but some praised the Principality and Laws, others admired and preferred their forces before those of the Venetian or Switzerland, without any consideration of their inequality or disproportion; And thus under the name of Noblemen, they distracted and tore in pieces the Govern∣ment,
or else because they fell short of others in dignity; the Plbeyan strength also approaching, stirred up the vulgar by words, whereby becoming unruly, and not to be led, their suspicions egged them to cruelty, so that nothing would con∣tent them but free liberty, without any exception; within and without, abroad and at home, there was nothing but facti∣on and sedition: Nor by this was the Warre lossened, onely it was delayed, and not vehement enough for the time, be∣cause the Armies were ordered according to severall Opi∣nions. Amsterdam, which, as we told you, was one of the greatest Cities in Holland, and had not stood up for liberty as the rest, was then much favoured, because it inclined to Don John: But because the Nassavians had environed, and in a maner besieged, that City, and in regd there was no hope of relief in a long time, they came to Articles, whereby all that were banished for Religion were restored to their Country, but they should not have the exercise thereof within the Walls: But when the men of the Roman Opinion, who wa∣vered in the performance of their promises, seemed some∣times as if they would become enemies again; the Exiles driving out the Magistrates, and all those that praesided Re∣ligion, enjoyed all in publick. The same at divers times, and for the like causes almost happened in divers other Towns of Holland, as at Ʋtrecht and Harlm: taking occasion by their breach of Faith, from Magistrates instructed in this, that whatever they approved should never be contradicted by the City; which among themselves was very conducing to concord among them, but was offensive to the stomacks of their fellows, who adhering to the Pope, suspected that strength would suppress them. John of Nassau had the Government of Gueldres, the Prince of Aurange appointing him to that charge, that so he might stand the more strongly guarded: But in Frizeland,
whereof Rennerberge then was made Governour; the old Dis∣sentions of Groningen City, and the Country adjacent, began anew to flame, for the carrying forth of their Reveues, though for the maintaining their Peace; questionable, if not with the Governours Desire, that he might the more surely Command. The Commons of the City bound the Deputies of the adverse Party to themselves; and the same, after both Sides bad shewed their Valour, in their privnte Darings, came off Victor: However, all Prisoners taken were set at Liberty; yet did Animosities remain, untill they came to be inter∣mingled in the Publike Contention; although both Matthias, and the Prince of Aurange, interposed to settle them Rennerberg also commanded some of the Senators of Frize∣land to be removed, and diligently watched, who had shewed themselves well pleased at the Spanish Victory, and substitu∣ted others in their Room; the like also he did by the Bishop of Leuwarden: For these Merits, and good Works, he is cho∣sen Captain, particularly for the Ruling and subjecting Over-Issel, for the German Souldiers, hired by Don John, held both Campen, and Daventry; both which Cities, were soon after yielded: But the Army staying something longer at Daven∣try, Casimire came to them with a fresh Recruit of Eight Thousand Foot, and almost as many Horse; For the Queen of England, instead of the Money she did promise, sent Soul∣diers, whose Number, he of his own free Will increased, as if he had been obliged: Which the Chiefrains of the Romane Religion looked upon as very ominous; and therefore they forthwith laboured by all means, to intreat and win Francis of Valois to be the Head of their Sect; which the Prince of Aurange, as well as others, saw, but would seem to take no Notice thereof, because they would not draw new Suspitions upon themselves: Wherefore Francis, by the Decree of the States, is named, The Defender of the Belgick Liberty: And moreover, Provision was made for Imbursement of all
Charges, by giving to him, as a Reward or Gratuity of their Alliance, whatever Towns the Enemy held beyond the Maze. While these things are doing, and the Inferiour differ about Fancies in Religion, and the Great Ones quarrel about Realities in Dominion, the Followers of the Innovated Religion, obtain a Power very safe to themselves, but hazar∣dous to the Commonwealth; for the Right of Ruling, being in the hands of many, there was no higher Power to restrain or keep under particular Animosities and Feuds; They Petition Matthias, and the Prince of Aurange, who was not ignorant thereof before; wherein they set forth, That they never ha∣ving been Servants to Tyranny, but rather Marks for the Cruelty of the Spaniards, who had designed the Ruine of the Com∣monwealth, by robbing her of the best part of her Citizens, were not more maligned by her Enemies abroad; Though they had this most certain Pledge of their Faith, that their onely hope rested in the Publike Safety: for if the old Ceremonies should return, as the rest of the People can expect nothing but Penury and Slavery: so they are sure to have no other pity than that of Torments, Fire, and Death; Meritedly therefore, they desire an equal share of Li∣berty since nothing can be by them expected from a Kingdom but Tyranny. They looked not after rich Benefices, and ample Re∣venues, but were content others should enjoy them; onely they beg∣ged they might not be banished both from the Church and Court as profane Persons. That they never were Apostates, either in their Piety towards God, or their Fidelity towards their Coun∣try. Some doubt there was a while, how to Resolve; but at last praising the Examples of Germany and Poland, agreeing many old Customs, it was concluded by the Counsell of those, who had put forward these things: That it was very necessary, for the maintaining of Unity and Concord, that these just Desires should not be rejected; for they could not have an Army of any value or strength, but it must chiefly consist of them; and
they found by Experiment, that no Persons might be with  safety trusted with the care and management of Affairs, that they. In this Vicissitude of Affairs, it came to pass, that several of the Romane Opinion, especially those who took to them selves the Names of Jesuits, could not be drawn to take Oath against Dan John; and no small part, whose hope ma depended upon the King's Success, voluntarily defend them: But many of the Magistrates, though so instructed  if they had fore-seen the Rising Authority of that Side, em∣braced that Form of Worship, which the Nassanians helds And for these Causes, Honours were communicative to them, and in some places, no less than a hundred Families de∣sired they might have, by Command, places see apart for the Publike Worship, on the same Condition, That the like should be granted to those who preferred the Doctrine of the Latin Church through Holland and Zealand, which yet was never af∣fected. The things which followed after this, are not to  passed by, without Compassion or a sad Remembrance; Such Commotions, such Hatreds, and such Troubles, one still fol∣lowing another: For as the Romanists would grant nothing at all to the other, so they not satisfied so much now with their Impunity and privacy, upon their own private account took by force the Administration of the Law, from the more violent and stubborn Magistrates; and after they had therein prevailed, they began to look at Revenge: So that they wh but lately wished ill to the Spaniard, now of a suddain jo both their Purses and Counsels against them; Citizens now against Citizens, standing armed in the very Cities; which being free from their Publike Enemies, they endeavoured  drive away their private Adversaries; there was not m need here of the Souldier his help, being onely necessary preserve Domestick Peace. And as they which labour of a Deadly Disease, for the most part despise all Remedies;  here, they who were Lovers and Promoters of Peace and
and Concord, were on all hands hated by these strong Pro∣moters of Sedition. And indeed, they ought to have studied nothing but Patience, to see such persons, by whom the com∣mon Plague of this Age was scattered into both Parties, and the Names of all things inverted: So that a blind and per∣verse Obstinacy in Discord, was called a Holy Zeal, and Mo∣desty and meekness of Mind, Sloth; nay, sometimes Trea∣son. The People of Gaunt now grown to that heighth of Licen∣tiousness, that they could not hope for Pardon or Impunity, but from the monstrous Greatness of their Villany, being still egg'd on further by that Boutefeu Imbis, who had crept up into Power by a Thredbare Journey formerly to openly detract the Government: They protest, they will no longer so much as see those Romane Superstitions, that have invented so many Wickednesses and Cruelties; not that the Authors or Fomenters of the Sedition esteemed much of any Religion, for they would raise Tumults under the pre∣tence of both; but onely they preferr'd Novelties, before things received from Antiquity, and their own Fancies, be∣fore any Truth that could be taught them; and having by chance convicted some Monks of detestable Sensualities, first they expelled that Order, yet groaning under the Weight of their fresh Malice and furious Hatred, and afterwards all Priests. Then being conscious to themselves, of what they had begun, they begin to fortifie their City with strong Bul∣warks and Rampires; which being of a vast compass, equal almost to the greatest Cities, was not totally inhabited; for having been often besieged, and fearing the like again, from the vileness of their Action in time to come, they inclosed many Fields within their Works or Wll: And the more their Fortification proceeded, and came nearer the finishing, so much less they did hearken to the Commands, either of Matthias, or the States, or take notice of their vain objecting their Crimes against them; seeking backward still for new
Pretences, out of those very things which they had stirred  against themselves: Neither could the Prince of Aurange's Authority any whit prevail with them, though by his Inter∣cession the same People of Gaunt had obtained again their Antient Laws, which they had before forfeited by a Rebelli∣on against the Emperour Charles: But the Mischief rather increased and spread into other Cities of Flanders: On the contrary, those of Artoys and Henault, were more constant and stedfast to the Romane Religion, for most of them were of that Judgment: And the Lords being averse to the Prince of Aurange, with a kind of civil Objuration, refused to hear of the New Law; for they said, that it was specified in the League, that nothing should be altered in Religion, while the We continued. Some did advise, that the City of Gaunt, being by this Sedition lyable to Treachery, should by War be compelled to Obedience: But neither the Prince of Aurange, nor seve∣ral other of the Nobles, would consent to that, to turn the Arms or Forces against Citizens, how ill deserving soever while the Spaniard, their Enemy, with a powerful Army lay almost in the middle of their Country; for that, indeed, were to make good that, which some of the wisest of their Enemies had fore-told of them, that their own Discord w destroy them. But while it was dangerous to inforce them, they slighted all Commands, Counsels, and Intreaties, look∣ing upon them onely as predetermined Malice. At this ti Bossis, whom we formerly mention'd to have been taken in the Sea of Frizeland, when he commanded the scatter'd Re∣mains of Holland under Alva, was General of the gre Army of the Netherlanders, the States having taken that Ho∣nour from Lalain; because at the unhappy Battel of Ge he forsook the Camp, without their Leave or Commandment▪ The Viscount of Gaunt was Commander in Chief of the Horse; Lanove, who had won great Renown in the Civil Wars of France, was Camp-Master General.
Don John assaulted their Camp, scituate not far from Mech∣lin, at a Village called Rimenen, and was onely Repulsed, there being, as many both believed and said, a great Errour committed, in that they did not follow them in the Rear, as they marched off; which had they done, that onely Day had scatter'd and broken all the Spanish Forces. But that Year might have been spent in the Besieging of Towns, if the Cap∣tains Prudence and Fore-sight had provided Pioneers, and such other like People, as are fit to attend an Army for such Work. Among all these Changes of Affairs, there intervened some Discourses of Peace; for some Forreign Princes, being desired to propose some way to make a Peace, did perswade Don John, that in regard the Forces of the Netherlanders far exceeded his, he might yet go off with an unblemished Re∣putation, and let his hope hereafter wait for more happy op∣portunity; and as to the King, that he would do much more discreetly, if he minded to win the love of so Valiant and Warlike a People, and not rashly to cast away so large a Do∣minion, that he would now accept of them, while they were willing to come to reasonable terms; that it was necessary, for the obtaining thereof, (to wit, of Peace) that the League made at Gaunt should be confirmed; and in that, the Clause particularly, that Religion should be left to every Man's free Will: That it was most just, that all Prisoners should be set at liberty, and among them chiefly, the Prince of Aurange's Son; That whosoever intended to make a Peace with the States: must comprehend therein all these particulars; by which means all might be reconciled. To these, Don John answer'd, That unless the Prince of Au∣range might be banished into Holland, there could be no hopes to make Peace; That he would grant nothing as to matter of Re∣ligion, onely he seemed to incline to a Truce. The truth is, Peace is generally made, according to the pleasure and liking of the strongest; and to the Weaker, every Delay in point of
War, is very advantageous: but when he was re-inforced with Thirty Thousand Foot, and Six Thousand Horse; so that he believed himself in a manner as strong as the Netherlan∣ders, especially as they had Discords among themselves, pitching his Camp in the Mountain Bonga, which is near to Namur, he broke off the Treaty, all thought of Pacification being laid aside in his Commanding Breast. Casimire, in the mean time, by a stay longer than ordinary in Gelderland, be∣ing unfurnished of Money, though very slowly, yet at last got together a great Army: By his Conjunction, the Army of the Netherlanders consisted of Forty Thousand Foot, and Twenty Thousand Horse; with which strength, it was re∣solved to stay for the Aids of Francis of Valois, when (but too late) they intended to besiege Don John, being full of hopes, if they could but once begin it, to bring it to perfecti∣on: But the sins of the former Time, too much greediness and Ambition, after Wealth, Honour, and their Licentious∣ness, in the abusing both, which had before been the cause of the Netherlanders Slavery to the Spaniards, was now again the main Obstacle and Diversion of the Liberty, which was even in their sight, and almost come to their possession: For the Differences of those of Henault and Artois, with them of Flanders, was come to that heighth, that without any Care of the Publike Good, the particular People of each Province, would reserve and keep all Taxes and Tributes unto their proper uses: And this Example spreading it self further, certain Bands of Souldiers, lately grown wanton with Ease, being a little defalked or delayed in their Pay, left the Ser∣vice of the Commonwealth, by a secret complotting and con∣trivance of the Captains, who thought they had not prefer∣ment suiting to, or proportionable with, their Worth and Me∣rits: These Souldiers therefore seizing Mayn (a Free Town in Flanders) forrage and risle all the adjoyning Coun∣try. Hitherto it was hoped, that this Storm would have been
kept within their own Bounds, when of a suddain Montigny, a Man of great Authority among the Captains, undertook the Government, and went over to the Artoysian Faction: The Gauntoys listed divers Companies, to repel the Injuries of∣fered by those: But these Souldiers, though at Home fierce and untractable, yet unexpert in War, were not of strength sufficient to hinder the Enemies depopulating the Country: For they gave it out in Speech, that the Priests, which by Force and Sedition were thrust out of Gaunt, lived in Banish∣ment among them; and that they could not reasonably deny nourishment to so great a Company of poor Supplyants, ei∣ther for the Sanctity of their Order, or the meanness of their present Fortune; but also, since there was no place left for Equity and Justice, to demand and regain by Arms those things whereof they were robbed by those Barbarous Spoilers: Under this pretence of War, (for now these private Quarrels were broke out into open Hostility) great Spoil was daily made, until the Flandrians, at the instigation of Casimire, re∣ceived Souldiers from him, promising Pay out of his own Store, for then the whole Country was even brought to Po∣verty: It was supposed, that he hoped for the Government, but he was deluded therein by the Peoples Inconstancy, as well as other Events of Matters. But in all these Vicissitudes, the Towns of Henault re∣ceived Francis of Valois, who knowing by whose means it came to pass, gratified Lalayn, the Governour of that Pro∣vince for it. He had with him, something more than Eight Hundred Horse, and Six Thousand Foot, the Refuse and Remains of the French Troubles and Tumults; whom, after a very hard Journey, and Plunders committed every where as they passed, having first taken some Castles; and Autumn now coming on apace, he brought to the Town of Bingen. This came under his Subjection by Storm and Siege, but proved a very mean Reward for the Expence of his time: He staid for the most part at Monts, a City in Henault, but
but not without great Indignation, that the Townsmen refu∣sed to deliver up the appointed Towns to his Souldiers to be Garrisoned; and when he was desired to come to the Ar∣my by the Netherlanders, he at first denied it, until Casimire did the same; with whose progress and success at Gaunt, he was greatly offended, so much, that being before his Friend, and afterwards his Competitor, now he hated him with so much Malice, as could not forbear to vent it self in contumelious Speeches: Nor would he be removed from the same, although both the Regent Matthias, the Prince of Aurange, and the Queen of England, declared themselves unsatisfied, in the Actions both of Casimere, and the Flandrians, but that he willingly suffers his Souldiers to run over to the Companie and Troops of Montigny. Thus these two Captains, both promising generally Aid  the Netherlanders, came both into their Dominions, rather is damnifie them: But not long after, the Duke of Anjou de∣parted to France, and Casimere went to England, both leaving this Commonwealth, whereto they had no Right, to her own good or evil Fate: But the Netherlanders, upon the depar∣ture of this great French-man, (though himself, and other Princes in his behalf, had accused them of Ingratitude) pro∣mised, That if they could compass any Peace with Philip,  should have Statues, Orations, and other things; in truth, but  Sounds, and meer Trisles of Honour; but if he would come to other Resolutions, that he should, before any others, have that respect which his Dignity and the well-weighed Advantage of the Common∣wealth, in that exigent of time, could require. This was the state of Affairs, when the Violence of Death, suddainly sntched away Don John of Austria, which might be hastned the more early, in regard that with Grief  Mind he repined at his Fortune: For when he endeavoured to make our, that he gained the Victory by his own Valo and Conduct, not the Debates or Failings of the Enemy, t see his Glory impeded, and darkned by his Foes, which i
the Spanish Court were many, he grew Cholerick, beyond either what his Nature, or the strength of his Body would beat: And surely, in some intercepted Letters, there ap∣peared contumacious Desperation: And a little before, Phi∣lip had privily commanded Scovedo to be killed, that used to take care of his private and most secret Affairs, as being dan∣gerously subtle, in the managing of the Intents of that Noble and great-spirited Young-man: For being known to have aimed at, beyond the condition and quality of his Birth, for∣merly the Kingdom of Tunis, and afterwards that of England, and also to have had intercourse of Counsels with the most powerful Lorrainers in the French Court, he was privately feared by Philip, least he should not onely continue against his Person, but seek to confirm to himself these Provinces of the Netherlands; from whence arose a great Suspition of Poyson, though but uncertainly pressed, who should cause it to be given; there being some Priests of the Romane Religion, who stuck not to cast upon the Country an Imputation of endeavouring such a thing: Others, suspected some Eng∣lish, who were sent from thence against him, and were there∣fore called Murtherers. The Duke of Parma took the Conduct of the Army, and the Government of the residue of the Cities and Towns; first, at the Desire of Don John himself, and with the good liking of all the Souldiery, and afterwards by the King's Command: He was of a more reserved and close Nature, bringing out of Italy with him, the practice of making large Promises, and the Art of Dissimulation: He knew the ue way to catch the Dutch to wit, either with great Words to fright, or with smooth Words to seem to excuse, them: Therefore, as Spain was not so much beholding to any mans Arms, yet he gained more by the Favour of the People. By this man's occult and close Provocations, he mightily augmented the Differ∣ences among the Provinces, which began to burst out more and more, especially after there had been some punishment in∣flicted
upon divers Citizens; who, to reduce to Unity a City of Artoys, durst make an Intestine Commotion: Nor did the Prince of Aurange leave any Stone unturned, to find a Remedy for all these Mischiefs; He becomes more sharp in punishing those whose Crimes grew great be∣yond his Envy. And now he had perswaded the Gauntors, that restoring and receiving their Priests, they should return and submit to the Covenants and Articles of the League, then he turned his Endeavours to Montignie's Souldiers, and the Artoysians, for the reconciling of them. But it appeared, that the chief men had willingly laid hold of the Causes of this Defection, and therefore that they were implacable; which so instigated anew the Minds of the Flandrians, that Imbis took to himself by force the chief Magistracy of Gaunt, and after bestowed, on whom he plea∣sed, the rest of the Names and Titles of Honour. In the interim, the Duke of Parma gave safe Conduct and Pas∣sage for all Casimire's Horse to go out of the Country; so that taking himself thereby to be secure from any E∣nemy, he besiegeth Mastricht, that had never been weak∣ned with any Garison, and makes Approaches to assault it. During the Siege of this City, the Emperour, to whom the Treaty we before mentioned, was submitted, had sent his Embassadors to Colen: Thither came also with the King's Commands the Spanish Duke of Terranova in Ame∣rica, and for the Netherlanders Areschot, and others. But the Prince of Aurange, who ever was of Opinion, that all Peace made with the King must be to the hazard of his Head, in this Division of the Netherlands, he being in the midst of so many Parties, and hated by all, did not vainly fear, least he should be delivered up a Prey, both to his Ene∣mies, and to Strangers.
But it would be resented grievously, and redound much to his dishonour, to hinder the meeting and Treaty, or to impugne the German Moderators; but that it might be co∣vertly brought to passe, he urged the points concerning Re∣ligion, to be firmly insisted, and severall others, whereto there was no hope the King would ever condescend: Many did believe that at that time, Conditions moderate enough might have been obtained, but that some for their private ad∣vantage, had broken the publick Peace; And the Duke of Parma, though intent upon Warre, yet never ceased to ad∣monish all desirers of novelty, that they seek to regain the Kings Favour and Pardon, by speedy repentance and sub∣mission. The first of all that reconciled himself to Philip, was La∣mot, which he did, by surrendring the Town of Gravelin in Flanders, whereof he was Governour, to the Kings Power; and having accepted Power of Covenanting with the other, he allured over many others, manifesting himself a mighty applauder and example of the Kings Clemency. Afterwards, Montigny bringing over all his Forces (which were eight thousand) added no small strength to that party, though his men were very poor; and this he did as well for that rea∣son of poverty, as for fear of punishment, which he knew he had meritedly deserved from the Netherlanders, Lamot being ready to fall upon them. They of Artoys and He∣nault for a while were in suspence: at length, prescribing certain Conditions to the rest of the Netherlanders, which they would should be used if they listed, they notwithstand∣ing came to an agreement with the Duke of Parma; the like did Issel, Doway, and Orchan, Cities in that part of Flanders, which the French a long time possessed, and after∣wards returned to the obedience of their own Princes, but yet they retain the French Tongue; with whom this was the cause of their private falling off from the rest of the Netherlanders,
because they could not obtain a proper voyce, or suffrage in Councel. The Articles of the Peace contained these Heads, The Latine or Roman Religion, their accustomed duty to their Prince and the approbation of the League made at Gaunt, and that i might be perfect, the forraign Souldiers to be sent away within a short time, receiving their pay out of the Kings Treasury,  which the Provinces subject to the Regency, should be contributary and in all things where any defence was required an Army of Na∣tives might be raised; The King would consider of a Regent, and in the mean while, all to obey the Duke of Parma. Thus the Walloons made a great addition of power to the Kings party: A People taking delight in Warre? and who the Spaniard might safely make use of in all dangers; And this was altogether the conclusion of the Netherlanders against forraign Dominion: Certainly, that Society must needs be firm, which hath the same hopes, or more Obligations to a∣gree than causes of dissention. There is scarce any thing com∣mon with the Netherlanders, which the Spaniards hate not; by which meanes, as enforced, they made the Peace at Gaunt, the Priests being the chief perswaders thereunto; notwithstanding all which, anon, every one endeavours to draw to himself as much power as he can, though by contrary and indirect meanes: For the Prince of Aurange, and all those, who with him were conscious to themselves, to have deserved the same things that the Counts of Egmond and Horn suffered, durst nor to trust the King: Hence it was, that they sought after all Counsel and Advise, which might establish themselves and the Sect of their Religion, as also to attain favour with forraign Princes. Another party there was, whose Crimes had been no causes of the beginning of the Warre, who willing to preserve their Loyalty to their Prince, and their duty and zeal to the Roman Religion, were very much in fear, least by others violence they should be hurried from the same.
It would be an easie matter for Philip thus to break asun∣der these cash and ill co-hering People. If he would remove but this one thing, from all such as should be imployed therein, to wit, the dread of the Spaniards. Where he gave satisfaction to the desire of these, the rest would follow of course; for all those things that for a long time continued among the Netherlanders, as bare suspitions, were afterwards converted into Hostility, nor ever after did the severall Reli∣gions increase, or ciment again together. At last there hapned, when once they came to divide into parties, a thing not very strange, that who would not submit to Citizens, should, without any regard of Covenants, be compelled to serve under a forraign Power. But the Prince of Aurange did easily foresee, that while the minds of men were inclinable to Peace, by the imprudence of some per∣sons, the Common-wealth would be destroyed, unless timely prevented: Wherefore using his wonted diligence, he goes to Ʋtrecht in Holland, and there with most wholesome Coun∣sel, he bindes all the States, being there called together, as well of that Province, as of Gelderland, Holland, Zeland, and that part of Frizeland, which lies near the River Lecke, and the other part, between the same River and the River of Eemes, each to the other, in a more strict League and Bond of Allyance; the sum whereof was this, That they would re∣main joyned and inseperable, have no other Common-wealth than as if they were one People, and that they would neither make Peace, Truce, new Warres, pay nor raise Tributes, but by the generall Command and Consent of all; That in making Leagues and Al∣lyances, and other matters of Consultation, the greater number of Voyces should be binding; and if any dissentions did arise, they should be reffered to the judgement and determination of the Coun∣cill or Deputies: That all places in any danger of the Enemy, should be fortified, and no man should refuse to give his assistance in his Arms; and that they should every one joyntly and severally endeavour, that equality be observed in rating of Taxes, and all
other things relating to the raising of money. To the Hollanders and Zelanders, the use of their Religion (one being common be∣tween them) was freely granted in publick. To the rest of the Provinces, Toleration either to use the same, or any other, or both, was allowed according to their pleasure. The Governours were set forth in these words, The Magistrates, Council of every City and the Commonalty: for by an antient Law, the chief of the Townsmen, whose Age made them able to bear Arms, were went to be enrolled into certain Companies, like Bands of Souldiers; and this in time of Warre, was for Garison and defence, and in time of Peace, for a Fortification to maintain it; when yet the art of Prin∣cipality had not arrived to the Coufidence of relying on forraign helps: This Custom and Badge of neglected Vertue, yet re∣mains, and the use is by these late Commotions in some man∣ner restored, while their faithful pains hath been imployed oftentimes against the Enemy, and for the allaying Sedi∣tions. In this manner, the Provinces which I mentioned before, took their Oath for performance of these Covenants, agreed on at Utrecht: And that they might the better be able to judge of their strength, they commanded all the people, between the Ages of eighteen and threescore, to be numbred, as well of men inhabiting in Cities and Towns, as in Villages, and in all other parts whatsoever of the Country. But among those Provinces, which were not present at the making this League: what, and how great troubles and dissentions had they, while some part will concern themselves in the care neither of the common Religion, or their Country, and others are drawn away by the vain hope either of ap∣proaching Peace, or the desire and love of contention? The Romanists held Boisledue, deserted by the vain fear of the other party; they that remained, contracted with the Duke of Parma, that he would grant them that proper Cove∣nant of the Peace, that they should never be garrisoned with∣out their free consent: It hapned quite contrary at Antwerp,
for the common people of the adverse faction remained their Superior, in a threatning posture, setting upon all such as had been imployed in the Solemnities of punishments: Not could the Prince of Aurange restrain his People, or hinder them from throwing out the Priests by force; though his Enemies interpreted to have been acted by his consent and will, what he could not by any meanes resist or with∣stand: for he was not given to cruelty, but was one, who would wisely make use of an occasion given, and for the gaining mens love to him, would lay before them long before the advantages they should thereafter receive: But this made many of the people, who were deprived of their way of Worship in Religion, to wish evill, and combine against the Common-wealth, because they believed the Servitude they un∣derwent to the King to be more moderate; nay, some of the Nobles from hence also took occasion to go over to the King. Among whom, Charles, the Son of Count Egmond, was one, who when he endeavoured to take Bruxells, Matthias, as was said, not ignorant thereof, by the unlucky help of those that followed the Roman Religion, the rest in∣closed him in the Market-place, as if he had been there be∣sieged; where then his own guilt, the Image of his Fathers death, and unrevenged Ghost, were all become tormentors to him; for there were them who objected, (and not with∣out some admiration of the chance,) that in the same place, that very day, eleven years before, the Father dyed by the hand of the Executioner, through the cruelty of that people, among whom the Son was now come as a Traytor to his Country: but at last, by the pitty of the Townsmen, he got thence away, and came safe to Nienove, who being received by the Dutch, was after by the power of his own People, as we shall relate, made Prisoner. At Bruges, there was a sharp and dangerous tumult, so that Arms were taken, and bloodshed very hardly prevented; both the parties having set forth Souldiers that belonged to
them, the Bands of the United Provinces came first, being hastned by the Magistrates; and this was the end of the dis∣sention: the Tumults of other Cities were prevented by Garrisons; Ipre of its own accord, came and joyned it self to the League of Union, and the like did Gaunt; and a little after the Prince of Aurange came into that City, by the fa∣vour and good will of all the multitude. So great inconstancy was there in the resolutions of the vulgar rout, and their levity being the same both in good things and bad: there, removing such from Authority as had by violence intruded themselves, he gave the Honour to others: Most of the Prisoners, which we mentioned to be there detained, being carelesly looked to, had broke out; the rest that remained, the Prince set at liberty. And another thing, which proved as well to augment his Honour, as revive envy against him, was, That the Govern∣ment of Flanders was put upon him, notwithstanding his many re∣fusalls to accept thereof: In the Embassey to Colen, there was nothing done, but what the Spaniard was well pleased with, to wit, that minds distracted to the hope of Peace, should never advise well concerning the publick good: The Em∣bassadors of both sides complaining mutually, that their Collegues, by private agreements, were solicited against the peace, disturbed by new Confederacies, not minding the Re∣pute or Esteem of the Treaty; But the Dutch, because of the present danger, for that the Duke of Parma had gained much upon Maestricht, a City partly belonging to Brabant, and partly to the Jurisdiction of Leige, as being scituate upon the Confines of both; and they could not get an opportu∣nity of relieving it, either with Souldiers or Provision, they desired the time of the pacification might be freed from War, and they hoped the Emperour's Embassadors would assist them herein: But the Duke of Terranova denied that he had received any such power.
Thus while a Truce is asked and denyed, while Conditi∣ons of Peace begin to be offered, while the Instructions of the Dutch are found fault with, as being not free, but bound up to new Orders and Commands, the Duke of Parma had crept under the very Walls of Maestricht: when, after a four moneths Siege, he took the City by force, though the same were valiantly defended, and his own strength not very great: But at Winter, he sent away almost all the German, Spanish, and Italian Souldiers, retaining onely the Captains, and one Wing of Italian Cavalry, though later than was agreed by the Covenants made in Artoys; but yet this gain∣ed to him Mechlin, with Valenciennes, and the City of Issell. In some convenient places, he set Garrisons of Walloons; Of these, as every one was grievously annoyed, or else of his own accord had offended his Neighbour, so was he esteem'd most safe from danger: and for this benefit, they confirmed on the Duke of Parma the Lieutenancy; not throughly un∣derstanding, that a General of an Army might, when he pleased, recall to their Assistance any Forreign Souldiers: But the Confederate Dutch, though by the conjunction of so many People and Cities, had lost all hopes of Peace; yet that they might seem not so to hate it, as to despair of it, they sent the Articles of Composition and Agreement offer'd by Philip, unto every Town, that they might be consider'd of in publike Council: Which being objected against, as unjust and fall∣cious, were these: The Acts of Matthias were not otherwise confirmed, but as they had no Relation to the Supream Authority of the Prince, or the Injuries of others; That whatever Regent Philip should ap∣point over the Netherlanders, to him constantly should be deliver∣ed all Cities, Castles, Magazines, and Instruments of Warre; He, together with the Senate should take Cognizance of all things, (there was no mention of the States) That all displaced and ejected
Priests should be restored; as also, all others that had born Of∣fices of Honour or Magistracy. All which things seemed to tend to this; That the Laws being restored in shew, by the endeavour of them, who would enjoy the Benefit and Trust of the Commonwealth, they should shortly be abrogated, and the People being disarmed, redu∣ced to slavery; for there is no fortification, for maintainance of Liberty, so weak as that of Kingly Jurisdiction. As to matter of Religion, the Settlement whereof w the matter of greatest Difficulty and Controversie, it pleased the King to grant, that there should be but one Religion throughout all the Netherlands, which should be confirmed by the Authority of the Pope, unless in such places, where  this time other Rites were used; and this confirmed the League made at Gaunt. Without those Bounds, a time was limited to men of different Judgments, wherein they might settle their Affairs; and after their departure out of the Ne∣therlands, their Goods should not be medled with, so long as they would commit the Administration thereof, to the pr∣curation of such as were of the Romane Religion. But this was looked upon, as very hard by all, and in a manner convenient for the Publike Peace, because it would turn upside down the present state of so many Cities, banish and expel from their Country so many Thousand Men: Nor should it be free for any man to believe, what his Conscience bore him Witness was the Truth. And what Country was able to receive all that should be Exiled? and if any could yet what safety could it hope for in such Multitudes? Where could they, whom their own Country thought fit to expel hope for quiet in a strange Land? But the Governours and Chiefs, without the deepest Brand of Ignominy and Villany, could not consent to be∣tray, for fear that Religion they were taught to be true, in what manner soever it first brought forth.
Neither the Hollander nor Zealander think that Proviso sufficient for them, for they had some strong Cities which dis∣senced from the Common-wealth, in the use of that Religion, to be revoked to those very times: From whence they might well doubt new Tumults, and their good will to become su∣spected, that their Cause was separated from the rest. They also laboured to work upon the Prince of Aurange apart, and by himself; when, though seemingly aloof off, there was offered to his Son, not onely Liberty, but the Governments belonging to (him) his Father, to himself, as many Goods is he had ever before possessed, so as he would go out of the Netherlands, and spend his Old Age quiely in Germany. But besides, the other cause of Diffidence, his Mind, that ne∣ver was greedy after Wealth, and, in that respect, unsullied and upright, was greatly satisfied, to perceive, with what great Expence the Spaniard would gladly free himself from the Dread of him. The Treaty at Colen being ended, Areschet and some Priests fell off to the King, from some of those Parts, whence Legates had come; for understanding, that they must for the future else be Enemies to the King, being reconciled by Letters, and accepting the same Articles, which they of Artoys had: But all those Councils, either of War or Peace, which they had Registred and taken Notice of, were scorned by the Spa∣niards, and by that Nation (that never likes any Forreign Thing) made a meer May-Game of. In that Treaty, it plain∣ly appeared, how great a Difference there is between the Aims and Intentional Designs of the Prince and the Peo∣ple. Of old time, when first the Nobility here made Insur∣rections, for fear of Forreign Lords and Tyrants, the Evil was not incurable: But afterwards, being more obstinately op∣pressed, they drew the Commons into Parties, under pretence of Religion; and the Vulgar Rout learning, that they were they that kept Kings in awe, or made them to be Reveren∣ced, and that they could be caught by nothing but Cre∣dulity,
presently imagined, that Despair of Pardon, was the fir Step to Liberty. Hence they did not act indifferently, or mo∣derately, but would onely do such things as were too fool to admit of Repentance, and going back; and by this means they arrived at that height, that afterwards they would debate the Commodities of Peace, but never mind the Hazards of Warre: They go beyond the wonted Custom, with Dome∣stick and Intestine Arms, while thence ariseth and springs the unlimitable Thirst of Rule and Revenge. This makes a kind of Pleasure even in Danger, and there is somewhat of Honour in the Depth of Misery. But then surely, there was not one general Army, but the Warre was scattered here and there by small Parties, and every several Nation almost had his own distinct Warriers This Fault of the Commonwealth did quickly shew it self; for there not being a Soveraign Power vested in one chief City (as there was in the Antient States, both of the Greek and Romans, and is at this day in most flourishing Do∣minions) but an equal Power residing among many Cities, itit comes to pass, that what should be properly the care of every one, from the Nations Industry, exercised in the getting and keeping of Riches, under the false Name of the Publike, the Common Benefit is perverted, and car∣ryed into a wrong Channel. Thus Moneys could very hardly be gotten, by reason whereof the Netherlands might have been in great danger, had not the Enemy been infected with the same Disease; for Portugal eat up all the Kings Money, as well by War, as by seeking to win the Love of the Nobles. For Sebastian the King, being lost in the great African Bat∣tel, and his Successour Henry being dead, the People had Ele∣cted Anthony, who was sprung from the Royal Stock, to be King, because they were infested by the Castilians according to the Evil Custom of Bordering Nations. But Philip ad∣vancing the Propinquity of his Bloud, among and before others, sent thither the Duke of Alva with an Army, to con∣quer
and bring into subjection by Force, those that would not submit willingly; and, at last, by his Endeavours, the King∣dom of Portugal was added to the King his Master: By whom, before he had lost the Netherlands, so much more easie was it to win a Kingdom. Nor indeed, could any thing have fallen out more happily for Philip, not onely be∣cause all Spain was now reduced under one Government, but because the Portugeze, who had by long Navigations, com∣passed the greatest part of the World, possessed the great Islands of the Mediterranean Sea; and, by Command, or Traffike, was Seated and Inhabitant on trie Coasts both of Aethiopia, and the Indies: By the Event hereof, the Nether∣landers, who might hope for some Ease to themselves, while the Wars in Portugal lasted, besides the increase of their strength, found also another greater discommodity, which was, That the Spaniards would now hinder all the Trade thence, wherein the main Wealth of their Cities did con∣sist; for although hitherto the Ports of the Kingdom of Ca∣stile, had not forbidden or denied them, as if there had been no cause of Arms or War, out of the Bounds of the Nether∣lands; yet there was from the Clergy great danger, and in∣jurious detentions of Ships sometimes used by Kings, even toward Strangers, dis-incouraged them, which the Portuge∣zes had promised they would never do: Nay more, there was Provision made, that they should be bound to appear in Judgment, before suspected Judges, or forced to any long Suits. But after both Kingdoms were joyned in one; and yet the Necessity of the one not at all lessened, by the enjoy∣ment of the others Trade; both having the same King, by various Names of Extortion and Force, the Sea-men and Masters of Ships were defrauded of the greatest part of their Gain; but yet not by a continual Trouble, but by such In∣tervals and Breathings, that under hope of amendment, and by the unconscionable Avarice of the Merchants to get all,
ever some new Booty came in afresh. In the mean time, by reason of the want of Money, there hapned many Sedi∣tions, on both Sides, in the Netherlands: But the Spaniards had the advantage, in the more easie appeasing and suppres∣sing those on their part; because, in lieu of Pay, they gave them Licence to do what they would, and Impunity for the same: However, the Duke of Parma got some small Towns in Henalt,1580. which the Confederate Pr∣virces had Garrison'd, and not long after surpriz'd Courtray in Flanders: Altpen delivers Breda also to him, the Castle on a suddain, whence he easily set upon and got the rest.1581. Lanove, on the other hand, to whom the chief Care of the War, in those Parts, was committed, regained from the Enemy Nienove, and other places in Flanders. At this time it fortuned, that some emi∣nent and brave men were taken prisoners; as Egmond and Selley, in Towns that were taken; and contrarily, La himself who was taken at an unhappy Fight, in a Siege, be∣fore a certain Castle; and was esteemed by the Enemy of so great quality, that they would not exchange him for  others. The English who were in Pay with, and fought for, the Ʋnited Provinces, took Mechlin by Storm, whose Avarice was so prophanely expressed in their Victory, that they did not spare the very Sepulchres of the Dead, the Stones where∣of they took away, and afterwards openly sold them in Eng∣land. Many other Counsels and Resolutions, of suddn Actions, the more powerful Enemy diverted, very few To∣kens of Victory remaining to the Dutch, by reason of the penury of them that fought in their Defence. At this time, the Duke of Parma's Mother came to her Son at Namar, being sent to take the Government (wherein she had formerly been skilled); being by her Sex more mild and gracious, and, by the use of her Age, a crafty Moderat for Peace.
But he, who had cut off the Follies and Enormities of Youth, to follow after Fame and Honour, telling her, It was no time for talk, there rather wanted Men and Arms, and that his Industry and Care was sufficient to win and keep the good-will both of the Souldiery and People. The Lady therefore went back again, and by that means did wipe away the impious Difference that otherwise might have fallen out between her self and Son. But in Frizeland, and the adjacent Regions, the Inconstancy of Renneberg, made, as it were, a particular War burst furiously out: This Man having with great Fi∣delity, and an undanted Courage, long taken the part of the Nobles, together with all the Frisons at Utrecht, subscribed the League of Ʋnion; and, by a Siege, compelled the refusing Groningers, whom he had made hated by those that were pre∣sent, to swear to perform the same: But after, being over∣born by the Authority of his Kinred, who had all of their Re∣volted to Spain; who, the better to kindle the Coals of Dis∣sention, suffer'd the Country-people, who inhabited round about the Country, to repel the Injuries offer'd to them by the Souldiers: Upon a Sign given, a great Multitude of the Boors met to take their Revenge; and thy were the moe cruel in what they did, because now they fought in De∣fence of all the Remains Fortune had left them. But Hohenlo, sent thither by the Pince of Aurange, after some small Fights, dispersed this disordered Multitude not fit for War: And the Frisons, suspecting their Governours Fidelity, set upon the Castles that remained, and, in little time, made them equal with the ground: The Prince of Aurange himself, being constrained to go with strong Guards to re-settle Ove-Issel, that had likewise bin sollicited to Revolt, and through Home-Discords stagger'd, not Resolved what to do. Then he, (to wit, Rennebergh) laying aside any further Dissi∣mulation, delivered Groninghen, which he then had the pos∣session of, into the King's Power.
Thence wasting his Forces over the Rhine, they carryed in thither with them frequent and mutual Slaughters, and a ter∣rible misery of fifteen years continuance. For the regaining of this Town of Groninghen, first Barto∣lus Entes, formerly the Companion of Marques, whom, af∣ter the taking of many great Prizes, by Sea and Land, and while his Thoughts were filled with the hopes of great Mat∣ters out of these Troubles, Death nipped all in the Bud a this Siege. The Duke of Parma sent Schenck to relieve it, who had formerly been a Souldier in these Parts, to which he was now returned, when he could not obtain the desired Re∣wards of his going away: But then he employed his whole Study and Endeavour for his General; for by his Ver and Judgment, the Siege was broke up, when the greate Commanders were all in despair thereof, and all Hon's men scattered and slain; whom afterwards, as they were re∣inforcing their Fortune, by some of the dispersed Troops Rennebergh again utterly overthrew; and having thus of comfited the Enemy, be over-ran many of their Fortific∣ations, both at Passes and Rivers: But when he strove  turn all the whole Fury of the War, for five Moneths, upon Steenwic, a City of Over-Issel, he was Overthrown and Con∣quered by the Nassauian Commanders; when considering with Regret, his Misery, with how great Loss of his  and Repute, he had reduced himself from great Wealth,  a horrid Incertainty, he was seized by a Disease, which quick∣ly brought him to his End. Verdugo, a Spaniard, succeed∣ed him, and got the better of Norris, in a certain Fight; be it advantaged him nothing, the Fields now growing we with Autumn's Dews and Foggs: Now were the poor Souldiers plagued both with Hunger and Sickness. Now there lay open to the Duke of Parma, a Possession large enough, and worthy to be taken care of, if he had plead∣ed to make use of so many Victories in that part; but while the Forces were employed elsewhere, and long scattered
here and there, they who then might have been forced to sub∣mit, had now drawn the ambiguity of their fortune into bet∣ter times. In the Interim, some tumults there were, and they such as might almost be called a Sedition, both in Brabant, and also in some Cities of Over-Issel, plotted in the Kings behalf, by the design of that multitude, which followed the Rites of the Roman Church; whereupon it came to passe, that all Images, wheresoever they remained, were taken away from publick use: nay▪ they were hardly suffered to meet in private, for the exercise of their devotion, for fear of Con∣spiracies. The Warre therefore being spread abroad on every side, the number of Souldiers for defence, was by the States in∣creased, as much as the Tributes were decreased, and fell short; and which was most difficult of all, the Souldier in∣clining to richer Pillage than his Pay, neither the Country could be freed without money, nor money be raised, while the Country was thus beset; for now the Cities began to dread their Garrisons: the Captains could neither shew their Authority, nor uphold any Discipline within their Castles, but are like an incurable Disease, while they esteem luxury, and all other licentiousness, as Military Gallantry. By rea∣son of which great streights, this Government of many be∣came hated by the Citizens, the Prince of Aurange having ordered many things, as well concerning Law as Tributes, and the Souldiery, which were necessary for the present State of Affairs, then in the Councel of the States, he moved this, That because the necessities of the Warre were sudden, and would not be delayed, and the ayds of the Assemblies of Deputies came in so very slow, they would Elect and chuse a Senate, that might among themselves consult of the chief matters of State. Affairs being thus setled, as he saw all things incline to him, by the eye of that Religion which Philip had condemn∣ed, and that the valiantest of the dissenters were revolted to
the other part, he began to discourse to them, the Reason why hitherto, while they had any hopes of peace, they made use of the Kings Name; but now, since he is grown impla∣cable towards them as to Rebels, and that it was eviden  any man was fierce and bitter against the Netherlanders, th he was looked upon in Spain with such favour, that he gre famous and honourable thereby; why would they any longer suffer the people to be led blind-fold With the voyd Re∣gion of an old Oath? whence come all these troubles  Commotions, but from thence, that our fidelity hangs ambi∣guous between our Country and the Prince? But it is not a strange thing among wise men, who will grant, that all Powers are setled for the Peoples good, by the peoples consent, that though they are greater then each parti∣cular, yet they are less than a Conjunct Universall, who  perverted, and neglected the care of the publick for t private ends, the People, that it to say, the States rightly ∣sembled, have power to judge thereof, and to punish the same. Nor were most Kingdoms any otherwise subject  their present Kings, unless that the People, tyred either wi the injuries or sloath of the former, have translated them  other hands: How much more then should these things pre∣vail in the Netherlands, to whom the very name of King is unacquainted, and their manner of obedience such, that they never took any Oath, unless the Prince had first obliged himself according to their desires, to maintain the Law: It is the Law of Nations, that mutuall Obligations are dissolved by the tricks and wickedness of either party. And having laid aside Philip, they would seek them ano∣ther Prince: And they needed not to doubt those things, which would easily be maintained against the Spanish great∣ness by their Wealth: There was need of a present Captain, and of such a one, who, when mischief raged every where, would, though with the neglect of his own safety, incourage the Netherlanders: That he had clearly cast out of his thought
all hopes from Germany. There remains then but one thing, and that is, that Francis of Valois, be chosen to the Govern∣ments whom they could not deny already to have given  certain proof: Nor was it a little material, to their advan∣tage, if that young Prince, who was next Heir to the highest Fortune, should begin his growth from hence: In the In∣terim, he was sure of the Brother-hood of France, and in pro∣bability, the good affections of England would not be want∣ing; against whom, the Spaniard of ae had prepared a Fleet, which partly by Tempest, and partly by the Portugall Warre, had been destroyed; and further, he had newly given ayd and incouragement to the Rebels in Ireland, nor had the English spared him in the new World of America, the Wealth which they took there from the Spaniards, and brought into their own Country, having laid the foundation of a future Warre. After a long doubting, and much hesitation, the Counsel was approved, with a greater fear of the Spaniard, than af∣fection or confidence in Mounsieur Francis and Philip, for violating and infinging the Laws, by the States of the Pro∣vinces of the Union is thrown off from the Government, and nor that sentence is brought forth, wherewith, if we may speak the truth, the Warre had now been in labour for the space of nine years; but thenceforth was his name, and all marks of Honours utterly left off and denyed, and the words of their solemn Oath made to him, absolutely altered; so that thereby, he who had of late been their Prince, was now de∣clared an Enemy. The putting in execution of this Counsel, was, to Neighbour Nations, guilded over with the severall excuses of necessity, and the severall fruitless Requests they had made to him: yet the Spaniards did not cease highly to Brand it as infamous, it seems altogether forgetful, that their own Predecessors had deposed a King from his Kingdom, for his too great cruelty, and that they preferred before him a Bastard, slip-sprung from an unlawful coition.
We will not mention old Examples of the like kind is France, nor any of fresher memory transacted in England, nor those newest of all of the Danes and Swedes, laying aside their Kings: But to return to the purpose, Matthias was dis∣missed with much affection, and great Rewards; And this being a matter of so great concernment, neither did the greatness of the action it self, nor the Authour, remain un∣known to the Spaniard; whence perceiving that the life of one single Person was the onely obstacle to his desired great∣ness, therfore, though he had fair Law against him in the field, yet he, in the first place, proscribes him, and then by the habits of Wealth, Honnur, and impunity, as well of all forme faults, as of that, invites some body to assassinate him: A∣gainst this new fashioned Edict, the Prince of Aurange makes his Defence in a Book on purpose set forth, as well to the States of the Netherlands, as to other Princes of Christendom; which Book was penned by the help of Peter Villier, a Frenchman, who having the Study of the Laws, wherein he had been bred up, first fell to be a teacher of the new Reli∣gion, and thence came to be admitted into the secretest Counsels of the Prince of Aurange: The Declarations on both sides are yet extant, full of equall bitterness, wherein after re∣petition of the Crimes relating to the Cause, on the Kings part is objected to the Prince Ingratitude and Treason; he, on the other side, retorts on the Kings Treachery and Ty∣ranny, and so intermixing many true, and some false Relati∣ons, at length they directly fall to terms of scurrility, like scolding Women; for, because the Prince of Aurange being seperated from his Saxon Wife, for Causes well approved by all her Kindred, and having marryed the Daughter of Mont∣pensier, who had been devoted for a Nun, was accused both as an Adulterer, and Sacrilegious Person. On the other, greater Adulteries were objected to Philip, nor was he forgotten to be charged with the severall deaths of his Wife and his Son, from the guilt whereof not yet
cleared, he had married his Neece in blood; for the then Wife of the King, was the Emperour Maximilians Daughter, by the Kings Sister; which Conjunction, the Pope by his Au∣thority, (though many judged contrary to the Divine Law) confirmed. Nor was it smothered in silence, how former∣ly he attempted by his great Minister of State Granvell, to have poysoned Maximilian himself, being his near Kinsman by the Fathers side, but then his Father in Law. Whereupon, the States contemning both the malice and insinuations of Philip, who layed the fault of this great defection onely upon one, by publick Testimony vindicated the Prince of Au∣ranges innocency, adding moreover, for the safety of his Per∣son, a Troop of Horse to the old Guard. The Embassie of the Netherlanders, was most acceptable to Francis of Valois, being thereby called to the Government, and very pleasing to his Mother, who endeavoured by for∣raign Honours, to indulge her Sons, already too ambitious by their over-swelling hope; But the Kings Ayd and Consent was requested, before it was convenient, and so did not an∣swer their expectation: onely the King wrote to them, that he would not have a respect to his Brothers greatness, but would also give help and succour to himself, and all those which were under his Dominion: which that he might more readily perform, he wished to his own Kingdom Peace, and to his Brother all happiness and prosperity. The present necessity forced the United Dutch to rest sa∣tisfied onely with words, and only to hope for the rest. And presently Valois, that he might the more strongly work him∣self into their Affections, understanding that Cambray be∣sieged by Horse and Foot, and fortified in their Camps, had undergone great hardships and extremities; He sets forward thither with an Army, for the maintenance whereof Queen Elizabeth had supplyed them with a great sum of money, and raised the Siege, and thereupon is presently saluted, Prince of the delivered City. Nor did he then intend further, because
the greatest part of the Army was in the hands of particular Leaders, that followed him voluntarily, and would not long stay with him. Cambray is scituate in the Borders of the Netherlands, the proper Seat of a Bishop, but was reckoned under the Com∣mands of both Dominions, for the Germane Emperours, and French Kings, had often contended for it by War: But in the last War with France, the Emperour Charles detained it, and built therein a Castle; the Souldiers in Garrison where∣of imprisoning their Governour, joyned themselves, and be∣came Parties in the League made at Gaunt. But Torney, a Town in Flanders, having been some while Beleaguerd, in the absence of the Governour the Prince of Spina, whose Wife, besieged therein, shewed a singular Example of Femi∣nine Constancy, at last fell into the power of the Duke of Parma. The Fourth BOOK of the Dutch ANNALS. FRANCIS of Valois went over into England, where, that he might strengthen his Friendship, by a future Principality, either himself, or the hopes from him of a grea∣ter Fortune, so pleased the Queen, that notwithstanding the Difference in Religion, there was a Treaty of Mar∣riage, upon certain Conditions, admitted: The Report hereof was very pleasing to the Dutch, but it proved vain, being founded either on a Dissimulation altogeher fraudu∣lent, or else hindred by the Displeasure and Wrongs done by his Brother: Or lastly, his own unhappy Temerity,
which had rather win all things by Force: Return∣ing into the Netherlands,1582. with a Solemn State and Magnificent Attendance, he undertakes the Govern∣ment, by the Name of Duke of Brabant, and Earl of Flan∣ders. Besides the Old Laws, there were some new ones added, for limiting the Government, according to the League made at Burdeaux, to wit, That once every Year, the States Gene∣ral of the United Provinces should be Assembled; without whose Consent, no League might be made with the Spaniard, by any Chief Commander in the War; and, at whose Request, all Forreign Souldiers should be Disbanded. In the ordering Mat∣ters of Religion, and setling Forreign Garrisons, every Province should be alike concerned: The same should nominate Three Persons, out of whom their Governors should be chosen: And if any Difference happened among them, the Duke should have the Hearing and Determining thereof: That two French-men should be admitted into the Senate; the rest, at the present, to be be chosen by the States, hereafter by the Duke; But of those nominated, as is beforesaid: And that the Netherlanders should have all chief Offices belonging to the Court. Four and Twenty Hundred Thousand Florens a Year, were promised every Year to the support of the War, out of the Prince's Patrimony, and that what wanted more, was to be supplyed out of the private Trea∣sure of the Duke, or the King his Brother. Now there was some hope, that the Men of both Religi∣ons would continue faithful, as well those who were of one Judgment with the Prince of Aurange, as they who with Valois followed the Romane Opinion: And these had To∣leration, to use their own Rites at Antwerp, but no where further, until they should take the common Oath of the Ne∣therlanders, concerning the New Government: Nothing was expressed in publike, but signs of Joy, and he, with much discretion, carryed a sweet mildness in his Countenance, and an affable moderation in his Speech.
Those that remained of the Nobility, were inward much vexed when constrained to observe in the Throne  the Burgundian Princes, one of another Nation, and that ha long been an Enemy to that Family, to wit, their change Lord; and that they should intermingle among the Nether∣landers, with whom they never had any safe Peace, and be∣tween whom the Hatred and Animosity even yet continue unto another Generation, and is still attended with danger∣ous and unlucky Omens. And the lawfulness of the former Oath, and the Respect and Duty due to their Prince (be  what he would) was not easily rooted out of the Minds of the Vulgar. But on the contrary, some there were, wh would object to them their New Religion, and that they should not contaminate so pious a Cause, by the help of such as dissented from them. The wiser sort feared Danger from this Discord, and thence to find the French-mens Rigor: But when it appeared, that it had been privately agreed, The Valois should have nothing but a Nominal and Temporary Right over the Hollander and Zelander, though he had taken the Go∣vernment of the Netherlands; then the Prince of Aurange who had been the Original of that Council, was found s with, as sharing in the Government, and that he had from the first beginning of the Troubles, always reserved the strong∣est and best Fortified Provinces to himself. Notwithstanding his Name was affixed to all Laws and Publike Acts; not ha he barely a Lieutenancy, or Governourship, but an absolute Do∣minion and Authority. And the Name of Earl, within those Provinces, by most offer'd to him; there wanted but a few Suffrages, to win him to accept it when his Death hereafter, shortly to be related, took him off, now drawing near to re∣ceive the Rewards of his long and unwearied Labour. But others rather troubled hereat, that they should be se∣parately subjected to the French Power, had rather choose to submit to the Prince of Aurange his Authority; who, be∣cause he was unable of himself to Desend all, had therefore
not unworthily taken to himself a Partner. It really appear∣ed, in the time of his Infirmity, how great the Affection of the Multitude was towards him; For when he lay very weak at Antwerp of the Wound, which the King of Spain's Assassine had given him, the whole City powred forth with sorrow, both Prayers and Tears in their Churches for him, That God would avert his Fury from them, as is usual in Ca∣ses, where the Publike Parent of the Country is in danger. And at that time he did recover his Health; yet the Re∣mainder of his life, was always attended with Spanish Con∣spiracies to destroy him, there being many times taken per∣sons, that lay in wait for the Lives, both of Him, and of Va∣lois. While the Duke's Forces drew together slowly, Parma led his Army into Flanders, where he took Oudenarde, (a City so called, from the Antient Neraii, who formerly In∣habited those Parts that Bordered upon the Schelde) by a Three Moneths Siege, and a Storm; which he effected the more easily, because the Townsmen refused the Garrison, which would have maintained it. Thence, after he had en∣camped in all the Parts adjacent to Bruxels, endeavouring to straiten the City, by wasting and consuming all the Fruits of the Ground, wearied out by the sharpness of Winter, at last he withdrew, and retired from thence. In many things how much doth Expedition prevail; for thereby Valois, on a suddain, among other Towns, won Alost from the Enemy; and Parma's Souldiery, by Treachery of the Garrison, won Lyra: This place was of great Concern∣ment to the War, in regard it was so near Neighbour to Ant∣werp: In the mean time also, were some small Skirmishes, with little Advantage to either side; and not a few English turning Renegades, and being contemned by the Spaniard, were a good Example, to teach others to be faithful to that Party under whom they first served.
Anon Verdugo was forced to leave Lochem, a little To in Geldars, not far from Zutphen, which he endeavoured  win by starving; because while he was about it, it was thi relieved with fresh Provisions; but presently won Ste (which before had cost so many Lives) without any dan∣ger, by the help of Night, and the Townsmens Folly. At the time Philip, having Valois his Opposit, thought he now wa∣ed more strength and care than heretofore, and therefore sends to Parma a Recruit of Spanish and Italian Souldiers nor durst any be so bold as to contradict the same, notwith∣standing the Artoysian Treaty and Agreements; averring, Th in that Treaty the Obedience of the whole Netherlands was in∣tended; of which hope he being defrauded, the Bond of the Obliga∣tion ceased, together with the Cause. The Summe of this Army, upon Muster, was Threescore Thousand Foot, Four Thousand of whom would make good Horsemen: and these Number remain, or rather are increased to this very time; wh Monthly Pay amounted to, or rather was supposed to exce Seven Hundred Thousand Florens, and that the other Charge of the War came to no less than half as much: That there∣fore Philip sent thither every year, over and above the Tri∣butes there raised, above Twenty Hundred Thousand; so much was consumed by the Spaniard upon the Netherlan∣ders: And that no more Money should be carryed over thi∣ther, they, who feared bad Success, by the ill Carriage of Affairs there, were believed to have hindred it. On the other side, the States, that they might win fame to their new Commonwealth by great and noble beginnings, advanced their Yearly Pensions and Tributes, which were at present but Four and Twenty, to Fourty Hundred Thousand; with which Money, they raised Souldiers, and then had in Arms, under the Conduct of Francis of Valois, besides Netherlanders, French, Germans, English, and Scots: The Forces, on both sides, were very strong, but the greatest part of them lay in Garrisons; because there being no determined Bounds
they were, as the Fortune of War required, put into Towns, which many times even joyned one to another, but still kept their Opposition. Hitherto Valois hoped for Succours from his Brother, for the wasting of those Riches, against or for which, the Kings of France had for the space of Two Hun∣dred years contested by War, to suffering of much hardship, yes, to the loss of their Bloud, and now, by Conditions of Peace, had made their Enemy equal to themselves. But the King himself had no mind openly to denounce War, nor privily to send the expected Forces, although his Mother Medices had assailed and disturbed the possession of the Portugal Sea: And the truth is, Philip had prevented him, having purcha∣sed a means to make Debate, wherewith he might perturb the then peaceable Estate of France: The stronger Party there∣fore did openly possess the King with fear, advising withall, That he should turn his strength against none, but the Enemies of the Romane Religion; another Party being politickly deceit∣ful; under pretence of more wise Counsel, denyed, that it was ther just or profitable for the King, who was yet not satisfied i his Successor, to exhaust and consume his Treasure for the use of strangers, but that he should rather leave both the Netherlan∣ders, and the Duke himself too, to their poverty, untill being drawn dry, they would fall from their Capitulations, and Contests for Government, and submit themselves to the Laws; as for the Spaniard, though he could not be conquered by others, yet he might, in good time, be overcome by a Neighbour Kingdom. These were the Counsels, but indeed, the King was of his own nature averse to his Brother, not that he was offended by him, but rather had offended him, and mindfull, that he had once committed him to hard and close Custody, more out of suspition, than for any Crimes. This cast the Duke head-long upon Counsels, dangerous, and full of desperation, and fatall, both to himself, and the Netherlanders; for when he perceived, that they would ea∣sily set him at naught, since he could not perform with them
in the promised ayds, and that he was burdened with an  profitable Principality, not forgetting that he ruled onely  pleasure, and that afterward that he was restrained and kept under by the Laws and Authorities of others, (which is very grievous to them that have been bred in a Kingdom) having divers times desired an alteration of the same, but not ob∣taining it, he resolves to erect a peculiar power by force, and to that end, assigns the Towns of Flanders, to be possessed and held by the most trusty Garrisons of his Captains: An∣werp he takes to himself, as the biggest City, and that which most favoured the Prince of Aurange, to whom he knew he did owe a part of his power, by an implicit agreement, and where the Deputies of the States were present, who were the impediments of his greatness. 1583. It is probable, the main inciters to this rashness were, not onely some secret spies, that held Intelligence with the Enemy, having their Faith corrupted by mo who offered to the Duke an unquestionable right of Domi∣nion by a Spanish Marriage; but also the Frenchmen, who poposed to themselves the ransacking of Cities, or gre Booty, Honours, which by the Laws they were cebarred  of which covetousness, there are as many Nations found guilty, as the Netherlanders had Allyes or Confederates. The success answered the Design where the French Gar∣risons were prevalent, and Veward, Dendremunde, Dixmay and Dunkirk, a Sea-cost Town of Flanders, excellently seated for French Trassique, were taken. At Bruges, b the old and new Governours, were outwitted by the extraor∣dinary, and most politick ingenuity of the Magistrates, w desiring under pretence of consultation, the Captains and Leaders to go to the Town-house: there kept and detaine them, till they had by their Letters, Commanded the Soul∣diers to march out from thence; which they for fear of the Armed multitude, without grudging, did accordingly: The danger of Antwerp was greater, though some Signs of the
bloody event burst forth, and with a dissembled suspition of somewhat, he did as much as he could hide the concourse of his People from the Prince of Aurange, and the Governours of the Town, There was the Army both of French and Switzers assembled, that the Fort of Endouen being left, and the Enemy fled, the whole possession of Brabant might be regained. To these, the Duke going out under the very Walls, as if to number them, with his Customary Retinue onely about him, he Commands the Watches immediately to be killed, and the Ports to be set up and seized, that so the rest of his Army might have the easier entrance. And now seventeen Companies of men fly about the Streets of the City, like Conquerours, crying out, The Mass used in the Roman Reli∣gion is holy, (for this was the Signall of the Combination) when the Townsmen running from their Tables (for they were at dinner) take their Arms against this sudden tumult; the first that went out meeting the Valoysians, Body to Body, hindered their endea∣vour of passing further; And in a moment, more and more ga∣thering together, on every side (fighting in defence of their Fami∣lies and Fortunes) with notable Courage and Concord, they beat all that entred into the City, back to the Port whereat they came in. There was a horrible slaughter, for in that straight, they stopped out, and hindred the living, and those that sled could not escape their pursuers: But Valois himself, when he un∣derstood the infamous madness of his undertaking by the E∣vent, made with shame and terrour of Conscience, and want∣ing all things, with as many of his Forces as he could get to∣gether, among many hazards of his life, and the grievous loss of what belonged to him, he sled by the marshes of the Fields, beyond the River Dila. This notorious and apparent injury, most vehemently in∣censed the minds of many, who before were no lovers of the name of France: Nor did Parma and the Netherlanders that
were with him, omit by Letters to terrifie them, laying be∣fore them their abominable defection and Revolt, and to the oppressions of their new Government were more grie∣vous, than of that they shook off; saying further, that they must bear with the dispositions of their Superiours; for a people could be safe, that rebelled among so many King∣doms: But if now from this sad experience, they would re∣turn to their obedience, he offered them not onely equall as just Laws, but also the Kings mercy and Pardon. The Prince of Aurange was sensible, that this time of appeasing this ∣chief, was too fit to be laid hold on for the Spanish Affairs and therefore, though his Counsel had once proved unfortu∣nate, whereby he had lost the main part of his power, the Peoples favour, yet being asked his Opinion, he declares the same, with many acknowledgements of error to ave envy the more easily. If the Common-wealth could by its own meanes be govern∣ed with the same unanimity as the King: there would be  dispute, but that we might very well be without the Govern∣ment of a single Person, especially if he be a Forraigne Neither is it now to be enquired after, if it be lawfull to de∣sert him, who first violated all publick Rights, and Law it self: of which there was so great care taken by Covenance and pact: but they were to minde and observe his strength 'Tis truth, he hath no great Army, but there were in  (to wit the Dukes) Possession, severall strong and well forti∣fied Cities. And the Netherlanders were now to advise, whe∣ther they had rather continue their Possession to themselves or necessitate their delivery to the Enemy. That it was much more convenient, since they were by both abused, that they should be in the French than the Spanish power: for the Spaniards Dominion being well knit together by age, would always find Instruments to oppress and enslave them: where as the French, if they should endeavour such a thing, were not able to fit themselves with properties to serve their de∣signs.
It were better therefore, and more safe to assay and try the French, who having been once taken tardy, will never hereafter seek such an opportunity; or if they should, would never have impudence enough, or courage to put it into acti∣on. They ought alternately to weigh, that in lieu of his own offence, the Duke hath done them many kindnesses, and to remember, that for the last years, his single care and pains had both defended their Cities, and frustrated the Enemies designs. That thus they would not onely revive, but altoge∣ther such unity as their Warre required, if Valois remembred his offence, and they forgot it. This Speech was seconded by others, excusing the impru∣dence and rashness of Youth, adding withall, that it may be the greatness of his minde, being sprung of Royall Blood, and never made stoop to the humility of obedience, and per∣chance too, incensed by some contumacious persons, he had taken that unfortunate way, not with intent to kill and plun∣der, but as their wickedness and mischievous Counsel inform∣ed him, onely to secure his power and greatness. And the King of France, had with his promises, and some implicite threats, commended his Brother herein. That therefore the Duke was to be treated with, to restore the Towns he had in his power, and to withdraw to Dunkirk, whither the rest of his men, who compounded for the other Towns they had, should come to him. In the Interim, after many and long delayes (and while he disputes the restitution of the Towns, and Provisions begun to sail the Netherlandish Souldiers, that were with him) for fear of the multiude, who mindful yet of their late danger, doubted newer and greater matters, and were scarcely satisfied. Biron is sent thither Generall of an Army of French, to stop the Duke of Parma's Carreer, who then by the taking of some Towns, had mightily infested, and did over-run Bra∣bant. But yet the Warre did not go on as it should in his hand, who, with much adoe, was drawn to a kind of Treaty:
Valois of his own accord, finding fault, that he had onely the bare name of a Prince, that the account and disposall of mo∣nies, and all other great affairs were concealed from him, so that he was not able to gratifie any person; And it was no wonder, if (after the examples of so many others, who had been called in by the Netherlanders, to assist them, and they had found sad experiments of changed desires) they had found him, who, long continuing in suspence concerning it, would now depend upon the beck of another; but he chiefly, and with much regret, insisted upon this, That they denyed to him onely, what was allowed to all other Princes; namely, that out of the Senate he might have a domestick Councel▪ The use of which Custom, John Bodin, their Master of Re∣quests, had praysed above all others, he being a man, whose wisdom and affection was well known by his Writing: but on the other side, the Netherlanders feared nothing so much; also the French offered somewhat in favour of the Roman Re∣ligion. Among all these Disputes, Valois being well nigh shut up in Dunkirk, when now a new affliction was added to re∣new his old grief, multitudes dying in the Town by sickness, he goes thence into France, either that he might refresh him∣self by the change of Ayr, or which is most probable, that he might recover his Brothers favour, between whom yet re∣mained some Seeds of discontent: Certainly, this Journey was made onely for a time: And the Netherlanders, as long as he lived, never left off sending to him Embssies to intreat him to send ayd to Flanders, in a staggering condi∣tion. Earnestly beseeching the King also, that he publickly would own his Brothers Cause; but if he could not do that, yet that he would at least assist with men and money, and that he should stop all the passages from France, into the Enemies Country. Which if they might request, they did not fear to foretell to the King thereby, a future Succession in his Kingdom, so that he should according to the Laws of
France, for many Ages, not want an Heir of his Body to go∣vern the same: But these Communications were shortly after quite broken off by the badness of the following times, and the death of Francis de Valois. He over-lived his Ho∣nour and disgrace not above seventeen moneths, brought to his end as some though, by his lusts, others by poyson; but most believed he dyed with grief of mind, the common end almost of all, who either before or after him, took a pride to aggravate the miseries of unfortunate people: His Fune all was not attended with any Ensigns of his Belgike Govern∣ment, all his actions there with himself passing in oblivion, while the King his Brother, avoyded to incense with such toyes, whom he durst not move with realities. As soon as Valois was departed from Dunkirk, the French Companies left there in Garrison, accepting their pay, marched away, not daring to trust a People whom they had so mischieved. Whereupon, the Duke of Parma, sends his inferiour Captains to besiege the Town, thus destitute both of Souldiers and Shipping, and anon after, comes himself with an indifferent Army, to strengthen the Siege; Biron was commanded to follow the Enemy and fight him: But the Gauntoys, out of an old grudge they bore to Valois, and ma∣king a shew of tumult, denyed him passage; alledging, that it was unjust and unreasonable, to use his Forces, whom they neither took for their Prince, nor scarcely their friends: By the stubbornness therefore of those men, Dunkirk came into the Spaniards power; by which meanes, the Sea ever after became dangerous and troublesome; for upon that shore, where there were no Havens or Ports, there was scarce any refuge for small foysts: hence, as they saw it convenient, or for their profit, observing the passage out, the Pyrates were wont to set upon the Dutch Ships, as they sailed by, either to fishing, or with Merchandize, where England being di∣rectly opposite, doth narrow and streighten the Sea, and they could easily escape by flight, from the great Ships of Ware,
either by their lightness and swiftness on the open S or else by helps of the flats and Sands, whereof that part of the Ocean is full; yet this losse of so eminent a Town, could not mitigate or take away their dissentions; but it was necessary, that Biron with his Army, should be sent out of the Country, (though the Prince of Auraage most earnestly urged the con∣trary) for fear least they should betray the Common-wealth to their Enemy, now in heart, and attended with success: so much mistrust had all of the French. Nay, the Prince himself was scandalized for them, so that at Antwerp, they all  to their Arms, upon a lye that was divulged, that the Prince had brought the French into the Castles, on purpose to be near to, and command the City. But he to whom nothing was so unusual and bitter, as to live feared of his Citizens, could not bear their changed countenances, and suspitious ill bo∣ding silence, instead of joyfull acclamations; but leaving the place, having lived there six years, he went to Zeland, and the more assured places of the Common-wealth, thereby ex∣empt from many eminent dangers, and free from their ingra∣titude. But the Duke of Parma, having gotten spare  for Conquest, gained by surrender, and otherwise, Nemp scituate on the same shore, but to the right hand of Dunkirk and more inward upon the Land, Dixmuyde, Voorne, and Berghen, that are called Winow. Thence in Flanders, the peoples hatred so increased against the Warre daily, and many so highly resented the late actions, that they would even take part with the Spaniards against the French. About this time, there was a certain base Fellow, he was generally called Hog, that by Discourse and Writing began to trouble Holland; who, notwithstandidg his Mothers vile∣ness, and his own mishapen Form, yet vainly boasted the Honour and Greatness of his Bloud, as being (from his own Relation) Son to the Emperour Charles. Hence, fed up with a foolish hope by some Spaniard, that Philip would acknow∣ledge him for his Brother, he withdrew some led away with
Novelties; and others, that were not pleased with the pre∣sent ordring of Affairs, from their then Principles, to a hope of Peace and Submission to the Austrian Family. But the Con∣spiracy being yet green, and but in the Bud, was, by the pu∣nishment of its Author, quickly nipped. Now also a War did begin in the Jurisdiction of Colen, which was offered, toge∣ther with the Bishoprick, to Ernestus of Bavaria, for the Marriage of Truxiors: For being Bishop of that place be∣fore, and being taken exceedingly with the Love of a Noble Woman, had made hast to lay aside his Vow of single Life, (for by the Rules of the Latine Church, no Priest may marry) which in the Heat of his promiscuous Lusts was ea∣sily connived at: Wherefore, setting Humane Decrees, in opposition to Divine Laws, and finding himself unfit for such Charges, by Casimire, and Nienar, Count of Nursa, both Generals for indifferent Armies, keeps the Cities, until by his Enemies Forces, and his own Mens Treacheries, most of his Garrisons were taken from him; and then making a League with the Dutch, he fled to the Prince of Aurange, whence he revenged him, as well as he could, by laying wast the Country: And this War brings on a greater, wherewith the Spaniard was well pleased, because he might thereby the more colourably involve the Frontier Towns of Germany, which were old Receptacles of Netherlandish Fugitives in the same: And this every day augmented the growing Fortune of the Duke of Parma, especially one Tasso, a Captain, win∣ning by Surprize, the Town of Zutphen, held by a weak and ill agreeing Garrison, and that by the help onely of one common Souldier that was his Prisoner: From hence all the Country, between the Rivers Issel and the Rhine, were daily infested and harrased by Spanish Incursions, nor could they at any time be hindred in their going off; and the City it self was besieged, but in vain. Thus did the Netherlanders, at this time, lose both their Forces, and other Opportunities; And as a further mischief,
(many of Noblemen and Chiefs, utterly despairing any Re∣medy) privately sought their own Security, from the Grace and Pardon of the King, which they knew was not to be ho∣ped for by some heinous Adventure. Therefore, William of Heremberge, who by Marriage of the Prince of Aurange's Sister, was the sole Companion of his Hopes and Dangers, inconsiderately, and without Reason, Resolved to deliver up Gelders, which he then Governed, to the Conquerours: But his Treachery being prevented, and Promise taken for his Fidelity, he was dismissed; yet notwithstanding, he fled to the Enemy, conferring nothing more of strength to their Party, than that of his Sons, whom he compelled to Revolt with him, though not intangled or sullied with his Crimes, nor insensible of their Honours. Now was the state of Flanders very miserable; Ipre was Besieged by Parma: The Gauntoys had recalled Imbis, for no other Reason, than to revive old Enmities, and conte with the Prince of Aurange and the French; who eft-sorts attaining the prime Degree of Magistracy, by some pests ferous and turbulent Predicators, did unsettle the Minds of the Vulgar. The City of Bruges, now Flanders was all in Combustion, had chosen for their Governour Charles of Ci∣maca. He was the Son of Areschot, and dives times had charged Parties out of Fortune; afterwards forsaking his Fa∣ther, in a voluntary Exile, he professed to follow the New Religion, and seemed most vehement therein, meerly to hide his Dissimulation. By these Subtilties, creeping into the thoughts of those that interpreted the holy Scriptures to the People, he deluded the simplicity of such as were not very circumspect, but well meaning men, and by them was wrought into the affections of the vulgar. Now this Charles held no lesse Correspondence, and pri∣vate Intelligence with the Romanists, than Imbis did, though openly both of them, imprison some of them, and not let them so much as come together.
In the Interim, they had so obliged another part of the People to them, by a faigned zeal in Religion, that whoever did but suspect, or sinistrously interpret any of their actions, was sure to incur a generall hatred: These were the two, who undertook to betray into the enemies hand, all Flanders, a most noble Province, and then strengthned with so many Cities: And first, that they might take the necessity of re∣calling the French they began to talk of Casimire, & Truxius, making a League with Germany, not that there did any such hopes appear, but that by the losse of time being left reme∣diless, there should remain nothing to be done but to submit. Thus these Commanders of Peace, first had onely licence to parley; but afterwards, they had Authority to conclude; but they had so ordered their business, and informed the People, as if a Peace had been made, not with the Duke of Parma and the Spaniards, but with the Netherlandish Cities which had revolted, for that bayt was more popular, and easie to be swallowed; adding moreover, that the King was satisfied therewith, and content with that obedience which was due to him, would not rob God, but leave to him all things Divine. Now are both Books and speeches cast up and down, stuff∣ed with bitter railings against the French and others, who had so long consumed, as well the private as publike Wealth of the Netherlanders, in so unequall a Dispute: That now they had no Forces, nor the hope of any allyance or ayd from abroad, and the Victorious Armies of a most potent King, had in a manner, inclosed them round. That now it was manifest, that God was displeased to have Religion profaned with blood, and that the use of Divine Mysteries should be maintained by force and slaughters: That certainly, the Pri∣mitive Christians lived peaceably under the Government of profane Princes, even in the greatest persecutions, as a strict Command laid by God upon them, and when he thought fit
to alter their Condition: He took away their Princes, but never allowed a Sword in their Hand to remove them; That when the power of Warre and Peace was once given to Prin∣ces, there was nothing left to the Subjects, but Patience and their Prayers: Nay, that Piety it self did rather chuse to strengthen it self by Persecution, than weaken it self by Licu∣tiousness: Did there many suffer Death by Law, under the Emperour Charles, and Ring Philip? How many more have perished now by the Sword? And surely, they are most happy, who dyed not in their sinne: In the Fury of Citizens, there is no distinction, all are alike miserable; as wel they who do such things, as they who suffer them: To an Understand∣ing Spectator, there will not appear to be the Causes of a War, as they are called; but the Ambition of a few, who by Domestick Dangers, have exposed their Country to Ru∣ine. The Duke of Parma observing all these Occurrences, takes Time by the Fore-lock; and besieging Ipre with strong Bul∣warks and Forts, that it might want the fewer Forces, be sends his Army under the Leading of the Viscount of Ga and Montigny, into the North part of Flanders, that he might confirm the Minds of the Netherlandish Lords, already inclining towards him; and that they who would not come in of their own accord, might be forced to Submission, all hopes of Relief or Assistance being utterly taken away from them. There is in the furthest part of Flanders, which the there undivided River Scheld divides from Brabant, and af∣terwards separated by a Cut or Drain of the same from Beve∣land, a Southerly Isle of Zeland, and inclosed with the Bend∣ing thereof, a place called the Waese, which then Steland Go∣verned, of the same Mind towards his Country with Are∣schots Son, Charles and Imbisius. Hither, when the Cap∣tains of the King's Army were arrived, the Governours forth∣with deliver to them all the whole Region, together with
the Towns of Hulst and Axel, and the Castle of Rupelmund, famous in Antient Histories of Flanders. The Original of this Castle's Name was taken from the little River called Rupell, that runneth into the Schelde, and whence not far off, upon the other Bank, stands Antwerp. A little more inwardly is Alost seated; to the Garrison Souldiers whereof, a pretty Sum of Money being due for their Pay (being Forreign Soul∣diers out of England) and neglected to be given to them by the Flandrians, they were sollicited, as Souldiers, by the E∣nemies strength, their own penury, and the Example of their Neighbors, to surrender, which not long after was done: But the Brabanders and Zelanders presently threw down their Banks and Cawseyes, to let out the River Schelde, and beyond it to Repair and Fortifie Castles and Forts, to defend their side of the Banks or Shore, and to offend their Enemies on the other side. 1584. In the mean time, the Duke of Parma's Captains, that they might the better be able to blow up into a flame the Sedition of those two potent Cities, pitched their Camp be∣tween Gaunt and Bruges, stopping up all Passages by Water, to hinder Commerce: Wherefore, the Romanists on both sides, and divers others who adhered to the Spaniards, under the Name of Peace, either out of Design, or Simplicity, no longer mutter'd, or sought private Meetings; but being bac∣ked with great and publike Authority, endeavoured to draw all to their Opinion, some by perswasions, others by fear: At last these, by the departure of the rest, prevailed at Bruges; and the Lord of Cimace (Areschots Son) broke out at the same time; which as soon as the Prince of Aurange had re∣ceived Information of from the Magistrates, that continued faithful, he laboured, that he might be suddainly taken by the Commander in Chief of the Forces of the Garrison: But the Lord of Cimace took him off with Gifts, and laying hold on that present Opportunity, by giving out to the Common
People, That both himself and the City, were to be betrayed into the Enemies hands. He conferreth all Publike Offices, and the Honours like∣wise which he took from others, upon those who were with him associated in Council: And by the help of these, be subjected the City to the Romanists, and so in them to the King's Obedience. In the like manner, the Town of Damm was surrendred, and the Free Ʋniversity, which of old being exempt from the Command of Bruges, and other more Bur∣thensome Duties of the Country, is called by the Name of Frankenland; And in all Assemblies of State in Flanders, hath an equal Voice with the best Cities: Nor would Ipre, the Third City of Bulk in Flanders, being next of all to Ga and Bruges, any longer wait upon the Hopes of a Common Pacification, and endure the miseries of a hard Siege. The Gauntoys themselves came to Treat by their Deputies, offer∣ing Pledges, and desiring a Truce: But Imbisius his un∣dissembled Treachery preserved the City; for he would have delivered to the Spaniard the Town of Dendremund, which Rikovius, by the Prince of Aurange's Command, stoutly de∣fended; and this, out of a vain hope of greater favour, he acted so openly, that it could not be hid: And when he was hindred in so base and nefarious a Counsel, he would have besieged the Senate House, with the Senators therein, with a Regiment of Souldiers, which he had taken into the Garri∣son, to serve his own Designs: These two heinous Faults, so utterly alienated the Peoples Minds from him, that they con∣sidered among themselves to punish him, being thus convi∣cted of Treachery, with the loss of his Head: A notable Example, of unfortunate Ambition, that he who was grown old, had been loaden with the highest Honours, and enjoyed so long the prosperous Affections of the Common People, whom Civil Contentions had carryed so far beyond Reason, that the greatness of their Crimes had devoured their Com∣passion:
This Ring-Leader of Faction was destroyed, though the Tumults were not quite extinct; yet, for some time, they who insisted upon the deceitfulness of the Pacification, grew stronger. But the Duke of Parma, having almost inclosed the City, and besieged it strongly with Warlike Troops, was well sa∣tisfied not to assail them, otherwise than by Hunger; and to leave their Fate to the punishment of their own Discords. But he had a better hope, and therefore took more pains to get Sceldt, and Antwerp, scituate upon the same River, the Noblest City of all the Netherlands, which disperses all over Brabant the Merchandizes brought out of Zeland; in regard his Troops were fresh, and that he in breaking up the Siege at Zutphen, had much weakned the strength of the Con∣federate Provinces: By this means, the one of these Cities was quickly won by force, the other gained by fear: Setting over therefore part of his Army, he drives away those Netherlandish Ships that lay thereabouts as Guards, and on each side of the River plants Artillery and Souldiers. But the Antwerpers, understanding that the Enemy did not lye upon the Coast over against Flanders, built from the Ground, for the safeguard of their Shipping, two Castles or Forts; the one, below the City, at the Village called Lillow; the other, upon the Coast of Flanders; on the Backside over∣looked as it were Hulst, a Town of Waes. This, in regard it was not half finished, being assaulted, was taken; but the other was gallantly defended, with a great slaughter of Spa∣niards, by Teling, the Son of Lenove, a noble Imitator of his Fathers Vertues: But all these imminent Dangers, were by the Prince of Aurange's Death too much hastned, and in a time most inconvenient, if we mind the Netherlanders; be∣cause by his single Counsel and Conduct, all their Affairs, though at the present so full of Trouble and Vexation, would have been brought to a setled Method: But he, to have been in a good Season, as to himself, because thereby he was taken
from the growing Evils of the Publike; to the Defence whereof, he had most strictly bound himself: For after his Death, the Commonwealth, partly with Intestine Seditions, and partly by continual Victories of the Enemies, was brought even to the last Gasp; nor could it recover, till by the appearance of his Son, fresh Vigour was infused thereto, and the half-for∣gotten Father's Memory, revived in the Heroick Actions  his Son. He was shot with a Bullet at Delph in Holland, by o Balthasar Gerard a Burgundian; who moved thereto, either with the hopes of the Reward promised in his Proscription  else by the Zeal of his Party, with a wonderful Cond bore up his Spirit, as to the committing the Fact, so to  suffering the Torments inflicted on him for the same;  did there want some, who much applauded his Resolution▪ although the Duke of Parma, an Italian, being desired leave that some publike Demonstrations of Joy might be shewed▪ because their Grand Enemy was gone, fearing to blast  Fame, and cast an Odium upon the Justice of the War, bl∣shed to suffer it. The onely Expression of this dying Patriot sent, together with his last Breath to the Almighty, was this; O Lord; be mercifull to this poor People: And all those who were more intimately acquainted with him, now growing into years were well assured, That the many Varieties and Changes of Fortune, which, from his Youth he had for above fifty years un∣dergone, and chiefly the Burthen of the present Cause, attended with daily Envy, replete with many Difficulties, fought against with the Passion and Valour of the Great Ones, murmur'd against by those of an inferiour Degree, and oftentimes hazarded by the rashness of the Vulgar; as it had inabled him to bear the greatest brunt of Humane Affairs, so it had setled his Devotion and Religion on a firm Basis. And this was the cause, that he un∣derwent all Businesses with a Mind so Resolute, and a Body so indefatigable, that he was observed never to be daced in
Adversity, nor elated or puffed up in Prosperity. I do not hold it fit to bury in silence, as a Token of his Abstinency, and even (as it may be called) Infelicity, that there was no∣thing so much by him neglected, (excepted the Glory he gained from the Civil War) as his own private and particu∣lar Affairs, which he freely assisted the Commonwealth with, but left it much disturbed by the several Issues of a four-fold Marriage. His first Wife was the Daughter of Count Eg∣mond, by whom he had Philip, his Son whom the Spaniards carryed Prisoner into Spain, and Mary a Daughter, after∣wards marryed to Count Hohenlo: By another of his Wives, which was the Second, being Daughter to the Duke of Saxo∣ny, one of the Electors of Germany, he had one Son named Maurice, and one Daughter. His Third Wife was of the Family or Burbon, Daughter to the Duke of Mompensier, by whom he had Children, many Daughters, but no Son: By these Daughters he obtained many great Alliances, both in Germany and France. His Fourth and last Wife, was the Daughter of the famous Coligny, sometime Admiral at Sea for the French, and a Captain in his Party; and she was Mo∣ther of Henry Frederick: Never was any Funerall follow'd with so great a Sorrow, even almost to Desperation, of all sorts of People; there onely remained this comfort, that by in∣vesting with the Care of the Publike his Son Maurice, who then, about 18 years of Age, follow'd his Studies at Leyden, with a free Inclination to vertuous Principles, that so by a grateful Remembrance, they might, in some sort, gratifie the first Author and Parent of their Liberty: His Father had assigned to him, in the Division of his Inheritance, among other possessions, the Town of Flushing, by its Scituation in∣vincible, together with Veria, Towns in Zealand, bought of those who held the same by the Title of The Marquess of the Empire; and, by that Name, took a principal place there in the General Assembly of the States: Besides which, those two very Towns had gotten to themselvs a Right of Suffrage,
as well as Middleburgh, Ziriezet, Tergoes, and Thol,  their Abbots, who in former days were wont to have the  Vote, though by a Right, whose Original was almost forgot∣ten. And because the chief Government of all was sought  from abroad, the particular Government of Holland and Ze∣land was given to the young Prince of Aurange, under  the Count Hohenlo, a Man famous for many Warlike a∣chievments, was Lieutenant or Deputy: But Frizeland  the greater Honour of that Illustrious Family, whereby  Common-wealth had won an esteem among Forreign Pr was bestowed on William the Son of John of Nassau,  his Uncle had before that sent into those Parts although  were some, who had rather have the Governing of Ci being exceedingly covetous of Liberty, though not of ∣ciency to manage it, which soon made them run into P∣ons, while taking to themselves the greatest charge  fairs: Here the Judges meeting together, drawing  Example, a Custom introduced under the Burgundian Pr∣pality; there the Deputies of the States of Frizeland,  newly setled as a Publike Assembly, according to the P of Aurange's Counsel, and their Neighbors Example;  first, trust onely to the strength of their Cities; the lae  on the Wealth of the Nobles, and all others who are O of Land. But Count William behaving himself with an indiffe Moderation, hindered the first Enterprizes of those quan∣some Dissenters, which seemed to be most eager. And in  mean time, was ready at all Assays on the Borders, where the Enemy got nothing from him, but were rather inf with his frequent Excursions, wasting and destroying the Countries. By this means, Oppurtunity was gotten compose the begun Differences, either by Argument or Au∣thority; The Deputies of the States had time to look after  Execution of all things commanded to, or by their Assembly
and to take care of the daily Affairs of the Commonwealth; the Judges were ordered to examine, after all other concern∣ing Debate, about the Bounds of Lands, as they were wont under the Burgundian Scepter to do▪ and also with the Gover∣nour, to oversee the Elections of Burgers, and Burgomasters, that they might be such as were most free from factions, Part∣takings, onely Leonard, and Franecre kept to themselvs their Right of Free Choice. Those Towns, which long since were no other than Villages, divided into three parts, Ostergoo, Westergoo, and the Seven Woods, had among them but one voyce: Now, by the War, their Use and Authority being increased, they had gotten the Third Part of the Authority, as well in the Sessions of the Judges, as in the New Assembly of the States Deputies, not so much by the Repute of their Concord and Unanimity; for sometimes there would burst out bitter ends among them, especially in Arguments that related to the raising or imposing New Levies of Monies; in which Cases, here the consent of the Major Part was of no value, as it was among other Nations their Neighbours: This surely was a Custom, brought with much Prudence among them, in time of their Princes, and very dangerous to Liberty; unless it be allowed, that Prudence, and Love of the Publike, should succeed in the place of Claim and Interest; which makes me with the more admiration to behold, through the whole Series of the History of this War, and especially in those Times, the Valour and Courage of the Hollanders, whom neither the Defections of their Confederates on every side, nor the multiplyed Tributes, which, among such conti∣nual Slaughters they raised were never able to destroy, nor the Death of their Chief Support, their Leader, bow to de∣sire a Peace; but rather confirmed, by the Attractive of his Name, to a strong Aversion from any Submission: But the Duke of Parma, (as if he had hitherto onely Warred with the Prince of Aurange, whom now (he said) the Divine
Vengeance had met with, for having been the Author of their Defection, and breaking so many Leagues) advised them of Repentance, and consequently, to return to their old Duty and Allegeance: Which Offers, when he saw so constantly refu∣sed, and that any further Trials, in the like sort, would be  vain, intending to perfect the Siege he had began at Scol, he raiseth Forts and strong Holds all along the Ways and Passages of Brabant, and in some convenient places open the Banks, to make the River overflow all the Parts ad∣cent. Afterwards, departing from Lillow, which he had  some time in vain besieged, on a suddain he posts away with his Army towards Deudremund, (this is that part of Flan∣ders, for which the Earls thereof formerly owed no Service, nor did Homage to either Kingdom) and drawing the Wa∣ter from the Walls, he compelled them to Surrender, when leaving some of his Army in Garrison, with the rest he pas∣seth the Scholde; with part of whom, he endeavours to  all Commerce between Bruxels and Antwerp, and with the other part takes Viluorde, which lyes between that and the River Sinna: The Gauntoys too, because the Hollander Forces were otherwhere employed, and they had no hope of Assistance, prevent the imminent greatness of their Danger, by a suddain and forward Submission; and this, by the Coun∣sel of the Lord Campiny who being Prisoner in that City, and set freely at Liberty, safely undertook the Office of a Mes∣senger on that behalf. But the Policy of Richardot is very memorable; for he proposing Articles of Surrender, being about to repudiate difference of Religion, he would not seem to take any notice thereof, untill he had so brought all their Minds to the desire of Peace, that it was not safe to go back: And this was another Devise of his; He had left S of the Citizens to the Duke of Parma's pleasure, to fulfill his Revenge; and it was of very great moment, for the Danger
being equal and alike to all, made every one seek, by all means, to save himself: Nor did Parma omit, as having knowledge of the former Actions, and provident to prevent the like in time to come, to build a Castle, that might bridle and keep under the unruliness of the City. And now all Flanders being Reduced under his Command (save onely Ostend and Scluys, two Sea-Port Towns) he forwards the increase of Provisions; and, to ease the Passage of all Soul∣diers coming thence, or going thither, he digged a deep Ditch to that part of the Bank, where he had pitched his Tents: Among all these things, those who had the Care of Government in Antwerp, implored the Aid of their Allies, set new Taxes, and raised Souldiers daily, both in England, and the Netherlands; and certainly, the Besieged had not like plenty of any thing; for, besides Sea-men, there were Fourscore full Companies of Foot, and Sixteen Troops of Horse, that defended Brabant. But the Senators, Magi∣strates, Captains, and other Superiour Military Officers, too great a Number to Rule well, distracted the unseled Govern∣ment of the City: And this Mischief was so much the more pernicious, in that the letting in of the Waters, and other things necessary to be done, for the publick Advantage, were hindred and gain-said, for fear (forsooth) of private Dam∣mage. The Neighbours, who were not so nearly concerned in the danger of the City, looking one upon another, let slip the Opportunity of relieving the same, while yet the Enemy was unsetled, and not warm in his Seat: When they were at the utmost pinch of Extremity, then too late they pleased to be prodigal, both of Wealth and Life, when it could not advantage any one: Truly, the vain Expectation of Forreign Aid did chiefly frustrate the Counsels of the Netherlanders, who were now driven to such a strait, that they would have subjected themselves to other Kingdoms, but could not be ac∣cepted.
The King of Spain's Forces were in a short time mightily increased, and if he should recover the Netherlands,  should be eased of the Toil and Charge of War, they would become Formidable to all near and about them: Neither was there now a Prince of Aurange to support them,  fainting under the Burthers, or to erect and stir up their Courages, quite tyred out with Slaughters, unto a hope  better Times, by his own Prudence and Constancy of Mi For, in truth, he was of so mild a Nature, and withall  popular, that he never seemed to be grateful enough to and for his Liberty and Honour, nor would he hide Vices the were fit to be spoken of: Above all things, he avoided the Suspition of Covetousness, for which most did esteem h Judiciously, many customarily, a person admirable, and worthy the highest Honour and Respect, in regard of his Age Stock of Nobility and Experience. He being gone,  Obedience vanished; so that it could not be restored with∣out the main Pillar of Forreign Aid to support it: For the Common People did not onely begin to contemn the Autho∣rity of the Lords, eminent by no powerful Resulgency, and lately decayed by so many unfortunate Actions; but the Soul∣diers also grew Refractory to Command, and had lost their wonted Diligence and Duty towards their Leaders. A all which Mischances, a ready Way was opened to the Pa∣meneian Subtilty, to cover the Slavery he intended, under very specious Names. Wherefore, now Affairs being as it were utterly desperate, both the King of France, and the Queen of England, sent to them such as should not onely condole with them, for the Loss of the Prince of Aurange, their Cap∣tain; but should likewise comfort them, concerning the Sor∣row and Mishap of their other Businesses: And this was a Noble Argument, that the Neighbour Princes, though they would sometimes leave off to Aid the Hollanders with their Wealth and Constancy, yet they would not utterly forfi them in time of danger. But it was much disputed of their
two, which they should choose for their Defender, for the bated Rule and Dominion of the French, was freshly remem∣bred in Italy, and the Lordly domineering of the English, was not forgotten in France, and Ireland tasted thereof to this day. Among these, the People being called to Counsel, they are very sparing in imposing and granting Subsidies, for there the Laws are of great force, and the Monarchical Power is not unlimited: But with the French, all their Customs are corrupted for mony, and he that desires to serve his Country, must buy the Employment at a great price: The English love hardship, and their Laws are very pinching upon words: yet no sooner are evills taken care for, either to be prevented or removed, but immediately, by little and little, the same is balk∣ed by example; But the English Religion was the same with theirs, which in France, by cruel and persidious dealings, was laboured to be torn in pieces, or utterly extinguished; yet on the contrary, there were some hopes from the Family of Burbon, that valiantly defended that Religion which they professed; out these were suddenly dashed, in the conside∣ration of the ambiguity of succession there, among the pre∣tenders whereto was the Queen of Scots, that was wholly devoted to Rome and Spain. Thus were present Affairs scan∣ned, and the events of future danger rationally deliberated: The French prepared a great Power, almost equall to that of the Enemy, the English raised but small Forces, but they were for Sea-service: France is preferred, but by the voluntary perswasions of the English, who confessing themselves the weaker party, offered onely necessary ayd in extremity, and received their Pledges. Thus the necessity of the times prevailed, to the forget∣ting, or at least, the laying aside those old animosities, which had lately been brought freshly into memory by the Duke of Anjou: And hence a great Secret was publickly discover∣ed to the World, to wit, That the Netherlanders could be
subject to a Lord, but would not bow to the Spaniards.  the demands and particulars were by many degrees more mo∣derate and reasonable, then those whereto Francis of Val was formerly obliged; and whatsoever their Legates had of private instructions, they quickly declared for fear of offence. There were taken away also from those things, what made their liberty seem hated, to wit, That it might be lawful for the States to meet without the Kings Command; That the Se∣nate should consist all of the Netherlanders; That the Gover∣nours and Magistrates should be chosen out of those that un∣named; and that in conferring and bestowing of all Ho great respect should be had to those of that Religion, which  then onely received in all those parts. But some of the Province would not consent to the obliterating of those things; After many tedious Disputes of these things, and longer Consulta∣tions than the necessity of Affairs would bear, at present,  lesse against the Kings will than the Netherlanders, it was a∣greed, that though they were not as then joyned against the Spaniard now approaching, yet they should by one another help, settle and confirm their Affairs and States. King Henry seemed to receive a great deal of satisfaction from the honour they did him, and shewed himself very wil∣ling and forward to accept and use the same, but that he was hindred by intestine troubles: for Philip, fearing the dimi∣nution of his strength, had at this time chiefly by private gifts and Wealth, blown up into swelling hopes the Family of Lorrain, whose power had for a long time been envyed by all France, who, having made a great Conspiracy, and boast∣ing the defence of the Roman Religion, the punishments of Hereticks, and dissenters there from, the easing of Taxes and Tributes, and such like things as were taking with the com∣mon people, grew so much more insolent in their contempt of the King (who was surprized with fear) as he was willing by large concessions, to gratifie their unreasonable demands
And afterwards, finding that his want of Children, his Bro∣thers death, that his next Kinsman Charles Burbon, was unfit, as well in regard of his Age, as his Priesthood, and the rest being excommunicate by the Pope, had made the Succession doubtful; at length, they openly declared, that he, to wit, the Lorrainer was sprung from the Royall Blood of Charle∣main, whose Issue was put by, and the Kingly Seat wrong∣fully possessed by the off-spring of Capet for six Ages. Henry pretending by his unwillingness to stir a hope of Peace, to the ambitions of these men, suffers himself a great while to be urged and provoked, untill the debates and quar∣rels breaking into open Rebellion, he too late learned, that presumption was not lessened, but rather made more heady, by being yielded unto. Therefore, the King troubled by these Impediments, would not consent to that pretence, as his Mother and the King of Havarre had appointed, but as it were, minding onely his benefit and advantage, and that by stopping up all the passages of France, he might bring his Enemies into a mean and low condition. The Fifth BOOK of the Dutch ANNALS. AFter the losse of so long time, which would have been of great advantage, and the damage received by this delay from France, they come again to Queen Elizabeth, being much incensed, that she should be sued to but in the second place, which might be some cause of their late answer; for so long were the Articles of the League there agreeing upon, that some strong Cities, for want of
timely assistance, revolted from the Common-wealth: And yet for all this Hostility and subtle devices of the Spaniard Ships are laden from Holland and Zeland, with Provision which, as the Wind would suffer, were carryed up the Sch to the Town of Antwerp, in such plenty, that by an unrea∣sonable frugality of the Magistrates, while they abated the prices of necessary Commodities, it was reported, that then was Corn enough to have sufficed for a very long time. A the Duke of Parma, being weaker than the besieged, w not able, nor hoped to get the Victory, but by Famine, and hindering them of this Relief; whereas the great breadthe the River below the City, where it opens its mouth into the Sea, and the ebbing and flowing of the Tide, which is call∣ed there by the Ocean, terrified him from making any at∣tempt thereupon, to hinder the Ships: yet because, the seemed to be the main Reason of the Siege, he resolved  use all possible diligence, and in something to relye upon his Fortune, which he had not yet found averse to him: For while Nature was believed to be repugnant to the design of the Siege, the Netherlanders neglected many opportunities of breaking down Works made up against them; and this it becomes most easie, while it is esteemed most difficult. For by making great Dams that extended from each Bank, farr into the water, the River was straitned, and the passage thereof grew very narrow between Ordans and Callow: the middle of it was filled with Boats, which were made fast one to another with Anchors, Cables, and the like, and so being covered over, had the resemblance, and served by use as a Bridge: Besides, on the Banks were raised Forts and Plat∣forms, and for defence of the Work, Ships of Warre. Above and below it in the River, were many pieces of Timber po∣ned together with stakes standing upright, that if any thing should be offered for the breaking or spoyling the Works, it might be hindered by those obstacles that lay in the way to the same purpose.
It is not to be doubted, but many Inventions might have been found, wherewith this imperfect Work might very ad∣vantagiously have been dampnified, if the endeavours of such as were Engineers, and practised the overthrowing of such Politick Inventions, had equalled the diligence of the Netherlanders. But all this whole Winter, the Duke of Parma was not disturbed; and the Spaniard intending to stir up his dili∣gence and Obligation to him, by some fresh benefit, deli∣vers up to him the Castle of Placentia, which hitherto had been held by a Garrison of Spaniards. 1585. Truly, a man at first would rather stand amazed at the stupendious Work, than hope to remove it, or beat it down, in regard those thick and strongly compact Damns and Engines on either Bank hindred any access: And the Ships filled with Gunpowder and Stones, and other Experi∣ments used too late, partly by the incertainty of the times and significations wherewith the Besieged gave notice to their Allyes of their Condition, and partly, by the evill ma∣nagery of those imployed, lost the success of what they were designed for. Nothing more remained now that the Schelde was thus bridged, but that they might bring Provisions over the Fields, which the River had overflowed, which Navigation was hin∣dred by the Caudestine Causey, which the Enemy got first, and secured by strong Holds and Forts, which the Netherlanders ought to have done; because it passed through (and was a little raised higher than) all the watry Meadows and Pa∣stures of Brabant. This place was assaulted not onely by the Antwerpers, but by those also of Zeland, and with that Cou∣rage, that now they had won it; but while they were thus valiantly fighting, they were cut off by the Guns, at a great distance, and so spoiled with shot, that they were glad at last again to quit the place.
By this unhappy event, the last of their hopes were  end, and at length, the City accustomed to Trading  plenty, when they saw all their Relief intercepted, not ∣ling to endure the straights of Famine in the want of Br when a little before the like necessity, and some Soul sent out to disturb them, had reduced Bruxells and Mech surrendred it self into the Duke of Parma's hands; wh case was something the harder, because by the abrogating their Laws, the King had brought them as it were into Servi∣tude: Therefore when nothing now could be looked for  Antwerp but extremity, behold it redeemed from that, by  Conquerours Clemency, who being of himself covetous to  Renown, and that he might by the example of mercy sh∣ed here, allure other places to more easie submissions, g toleration to many things, only this one he excepted,  that they who for the last four years had gone astray from the Roman Religion, should, having convenient time to sen their domestick Affairs, be commanded to depart the City And soon after, the Duke of Parma, as a reward of  Victory, was by the Kings Command, received into the Order of the Golden Fleece, and then put on the Cognizance thereof upon that very Bridge, which he had made, and was a work worthy of remembrance in after Ages; and in a little time following, he rebuilds and fortifies the Fort or Castle, which over-looks the City, and had formerly in the quest of Liberty been demolished. This so renouned City, added as well much Honour as Strength to the Spaniards in these parts; but yet not so much, as many thought, who imagined she would carry the greatest matters of concernment with her. Which was so dis∣proved by the Event, that the Hollanders, who had taken extraordinary pains, and been at great charge for relief of the City, yet could not escape free from the slander, or at least the suspition of having betrayed the Faith of their con∣federate
Allyance, as if they should get advantage, by the mischiefs which others should receive, and suffer. But on the contrary, they layd the fault upon the Lord of Aldegund, (for he was Governour of the City) who return∣ed to Zeland, whom he had suffered but the first invasion and guards of the Assailers, yet afterwards worthily esteemed, though never imployed in any part of the Commonwealth; for his disposition being more fit for Peace than War, he with∣drew his old Age within the compass of private Solitudes, and the tranquility of retired Studies. And the Valour of the Souldiers, by so many evills, was quite worn out; for they, when yet there was hope of removing the Enemy from Antwerp, having under the Leading of Count Hohenlo, hap∣pily got Boiledno, yet forthwith, through fear and folly, they led, while they fall upon the Pray, neither minding the Enemy, nor the receiving the Port. But the Romanists, assisted by the fortune of their party, brought into the Con∣querours hand, Nicumegen, a City of Guelderland, with the Town of Dewsburgh: and filled all these parts round about with slaughters, which happen'd either through the Captains rashness, or the Souldiers carelesness. In all which things, nothing more augmented the publick sorrow, than those miserable People of Brabant and Flanders, banished for Religion, or because they durst not trust to the Articles granted, having such malicious Interpreters thereof, and in brief, for want of Trade, or means to get a Living, scattered over Holland and the Isles, who yet increased the Cities and Forces exhausted by War, into a greater number, which shortly proved a great Omen of their future good fortune. In this interim, scarce did the longing Expectation of the League, concluded with England, keep up their Hearts: We have already related to you, the Offer of their Govern∣ment, made to Queen Elizabeth: But that prudent Lady
shifted off the Envy of that Dominion so craftily obtained Nor would she, in that ambiguous Estate of Affairs, intangle and wrap up both her Fame and Fortunes in a strict Con∣federacy and Allyance: It was conceived more agreeable both to Wisdom and Policy, to have some strong Holos in the Netherlands set apart for Her, wherein to settle some indif∣ferent strength of Men, and also to send again some Ships to the Coasts of America, there to infest the Spaniard, all weary him, till he should be willing to incline to Peace, and remove his Armies so long complained of, and contested a∣gainst. But She promised them some Aid, protesting in Writing in a Publick Declaration, She did it meerly out of a Sense  Right, by which she was put in Mind of that Custom of Pri to defend the Oppressed; and remembred therein, the An Contracts, and Leagues of Friendship, between the Dutch and English; with some short Hints of Spanish Extravagance. Religion also was made mention of the Security where commended to her Case; She had made good both in the Concerns of France and Scotland, without any desire of what did not belong to Her: The concluded Articles of the Peace were for the most part the same, by which the first Alliance had been setled; and that Five Thousand Foot, and a Thou∣sand Horse, should be sent to fight for the Netherlanders, and be paid by the Queen; That the Embassador, who should be Commander in Chief of those Forces, with two other English-men, should be received into the Senate, and be pre∣sent in all Councils, relating either to the War, or other pub∣lick Matters of State; That the Netherlanders should set on a Fleet of equal Number with tho Queens, and to joyn with them: And that for the re-imbursing of the Charges, at the end of the War, the Sea-Port Towns of the Briel and Flush∣ing, (of whose Government nothing was to be changed) toge∣ther with the Castle of Zeburgh in Walcheren, were divided into the Custody of English Garrisons, as Pledges; not with∣out
fear, for the future, though their present necessity made them cast it aside. Of this Auxiliary Army sent to the Dutch, Robert Earl of Leicester was made Generall, a great Pretender to Virtue, and who hid the unhappy and hated Spirit of the Family of the Dudleys (whereof he was a Branch) with an acceptable and courteous Behaviour. The Original of the Greatness of his Fortune, began first in a Prison (for the Greatness of his Stock, had not exempted him from Troubles) wherein the Lady Elizabeth was then also confined, by the Suspitions of her Sister Queen Mary. In this place he gave great Reve∣rence to the young Lady, though not in regard of the condi∣tion of her Affairs at that time: From whence, by obsequi∣ousness, and partaking of Misfortune, a commiseration and loving kind of pity arose; wherewith she behaved her self with such a Womanly Indulgence, yet so that he might nor forget his more Manlike Care, that his Mind was so ele∣vated into a flattered Conceit of himself, as he imagined she would chuse him for her Husband, being Queen; which though he could never obtain, by the Emulation of those who loved him not, yet was he raised even to the highest Pitch of Honour; and though surrounded with Envy, yet amongst the most powerful of his Enemies, he passed without Affront or Molestation. When he first came among the Hollanders, he was followed by the Love and Affection of the People, and courted with the Flattery of the Great Men; for there was a certain pleasant and winning Majesty, both in his Countenance, and Speech; and he was really looked upon, as the onely Restorer of their lost and decayed For∣tune. He used an excellent Freedom and Liberality, both in his Letters and Martiall Acts; wherewith the Netherlan∣ders were so taken, that in all hast, to this person, though a Forraigner, and among his own people, not altogether e∣steemed a Virtuoso, before any tryall of his disposition, the Government of the whole Netherlands, as it was in the times
of the Emperour Charles, together with the whole Command both at Sea and Land, and the ordering and disposing of publike moneys was committed; The Senate also were so addicted to him, that they suffered him alone to choose Assi∣stants out of those named, and in some manner, he alone eq∣poized the notes and suffrages of them all. But his outward zeal in matters of Religion, was the great inticement of all beginning his Government with the settlement thereof: And the yet fresh hatred of Valois for the contrary, made him the more beloved. And there were some, who preferred him be∣fore the Prince of Aurange, hoping he would not exact so much, in regard the way now to seek their right, was become shorter, in regard of their own Wealth, and the powerfull friendship of so excellent a Prince. But these two great Honours, some judged to be bestowed on him, to satisfie his ambition; but the more simply ho∣nest, only looked at them, as done with intent only to oblige the Queen further to them; but it fell out otherwise, for she urged them to excuse her, seeming as if she were afraid, that they would unawares in the person of the Earl of Leicester, throw upon her the Government, which she had before refused. But probably she had, as knowing his dispo∣sition, some higher suspition of him. Presently, that atten∣dant evill of all power and greatness, flatterers incroached into his Bosom, by whose insinuations, and his own ambition, (as there is nothing more naturall to a man) being envyed, when he was desired by the States, to take the accustomed Oath in Solemn manner, and to receive the Ensigns of the Commonwealth; he turns their favours against them, and, as it were, going into a Province, he enters into Consultation with divers, but chiefly Englishmen, how, and by what means he might compass the Soveraignty. It is here to be understood, that there is very great diffe∣rence between the Natures and Dispositions, manners and Customs of those two Nations; for the English, as they serve
faithfully, so when they are raised to Honour, they recom∣pence their former humility with much insolence and pride; But the Netherlanders obey and command in one equall de∣gree, no Nation having men of Eminency in greater esteem, not hating, with a more implacable malice, those who they find contemn them. Which Leicester not considering, and not acquainted with the Authority wherewith he was trusted, not taking notice of those who trusted him with it, began to fling off all thoughts of resenting, and to grow obstinate in his Opinion (such was his Confidence in the English Soul∣diery, and his present Grandeur.) And this was so much the more dangerous, because he himself knew nothing of the Intrigues of the Belgick Affairs of State, nor would hearken to such as had some insight therein. Nay, the Netherlanders themselves some of them took his part, but they were onely either such whose Estates at home being wasted by their own ill Husbandry, or the Wars cruelty, whatsoever slavery they fell into, chose it rather than poverty, the greatest mis∣chief of all, or else, who in the Country taken from them, having been bred in Honour, were now impatient to lead a private life, and saw no other way than that, again to rise by; the rest meerly lovers of novelty, for no reason, but because it is new, to whom, in brief, as it always happens in like cases of Sedition, all the loose and villainous persons joyned themselves. With such a Company was the President of the Nether∣lands followed; and first, they began to cast out oblique scan∣dalls against the States, which if they saw received with gree∣dy ears, then presently they fell to more open railings, accu∣sing all of the faults, which it may be, some few were guilty of, as if all things had been known and understood by this over-busie multitude, that conduced to their good. They advised him also to a too hasty and over-weening hope of the Dictatorship, after the Example of the Prince of Aurange, and he credulous of every thing, as having his
Judgment weakened by long felicity, and not well discen∣ing how great a difference there was in obtaining the favo of a Woman, and seeking the Soveraignty over a free People But the vulgar being incited against the States, who genera of their own accord, hate the Governours under whom they suffer any thing; He undertakes the defence of the Treasury a very popular matter, when yet in the managing thereof,  was as true, that the Earl of Leicesters Servants wanted fide∣lity, as well as himself quickness of understanding and fo∣sight. Nor resteth be here, but presently offends almost  the People, by an Edict, wherein he not only did forbid a Commerce and Dealing with the conquered Belgick Prin∣ces, and the Spaniards, which had hitherto been tolerated, ∣less upon some Emergencies of Affairs and times: also it would not suffer any Merchandizes to be carried or tran∣ported into France, or the Sea-port Towns of Germany, pre∣tending, that he could conquer and distress the Enemy, by a want of Commodities, if he should not be furnished out  Britain or the Netherlands; but never at all weighing,  there are many kinds of Merchandizes and Commodities whereof the Enemy had no need, and yet the Holland abounded with the same. Wiser Heads believed, that he gave way to the covetous∣ness of Sycophants about him, who had already in their minds, anticipated the power that he had reserved of selling Licences, and swallow the gain that should arise from thence for exportation; and their belief was very much increased, when Ringaltius, formerly imployed as Treasurer or Receiver, both under Alva and Requesens, and after aco∣sed for cheating the Exchequer, but then very high in the Earl of Leicesters favour, had Authority given him by an E∣dict, to inquire into the Letters and Journalls of Merchant contrary to the antient Laws, which looked upon this as o main part of their liberty, that there should be no search of, or inspector into, any mens private Affairs.
Therefore, when other of the Provinces, that were altoge∣ther unconcerned in the War, could not be bound from put∣ting to Sea and Commerce with the Enemy, this way of Gain and Livelyhood being onely taken away from, or debarred to the Hollanders, by which onely hitherto they had been able to carry on all their Affairs; their greatest and best Merchants, especially considering their number, went away from their Native to Forreign Countries and Cities. For the English took their loss of Trade more patiently, because a Nation more gi∣ven to Depredation; and then going to Sea, under the specious pretext of War, assailed and made Incursions and Rodes upon all Spanish Ships, and other places whatsoever under their Obedience: Nor did they spare the very Hollanders them∣selves, if some by chance at any time were set forth under feigned Owners, and endeavoured to go towards the We∣stern Parts of the World by those Seas. From whence it was found afterward, that although they could escape all the wait laid for them by Pirates, in that vast and scarcely fre∣quented Sea, they should be brought back to the Island of Britain: Nor were Commodities at Home onely of small va∣lue; but those things which were wont to be fetched from far Countries, by this forbidden Exportation, became of no esteem, in such sort, that the States could find no other Remedy for this grand Mischief, than by a publike Decree to lay a Re∣straint upon all Corn: By which means, those who had been the main Promoters of this hitherto unknown Necessity, and who constiued all things in the worst Sense, began malitious∣ly to alleadge, That the aim hereof was to bring a Dearth upon England. A like Project was this: The Earl of Leicester was of Opinion, and so determined, that the Enemies Lands, though they paid Contribution, should be laid wast and desar: This, besides the fear of Revenge, was very grievous to all; who, though at present, by Force or Treachery, driven from their Native Soil, yet, at some time or other, hoped to return thither again. The Souldiery also began to Mutiny, because
English Captains were put in Command of Companies of Souldiers from Forreign Places: But Hohenlo coming thi∣ther who hastned those that before lingred upon the Earl of Leicester's words; He undertook the Cause, and would  suffer a mixture of Officers, but would that each should  the Reward of their Arms and Valour: And neither terrified with the Hatred, either of that People, or their Leader; as  was not to be corrupted with the greatest Promises, so  openly took the part of the Noble-men, in a generous open heartedness, hating Dissimulation, and in a vehency of Spi∣rit, not caring to conceal any thing. The Care of the War now beginning afresh to breaken did, in some measure, lay asleep this new arising Difference For the Duke of Parma having, during the Winter, had some small Skirmishes, and several Castles about the Rhine being taken on both sides; and now, upon the News of the Le between the English and Hollanders, Recruited from the King both with Men and Money, that he might perfect  Conquest of Brabant, besiegeth Grave, a Town scitune  the Bank, on the left side of the Maes, and surrounded with the River both above and below; which he often before  and now again experimented, to be fortunate to him in stop∣ping up the Passages, and hindring Dealing. But Count Ho∣henlo, sent with a select Party of Souldiers, brake through the Enemies Trenches, and did them great Damage; and a onely so, but helped with the vernal increase of the River,  relieved the Town, that he deliver'd the Besieged, as  from the fear of Famine, as all other wants whatsoever. But the Enemy nevertheless, with a greater Army, obti∣nately continued their Siege and Assaults of the Town,  especially one general Storm was intended; which, the Ene∣my being upon the point to fall on, Hmerta, a Dutch- of Noble Bloud (and left there Governour by Hohenlo) pre∣vented, by an over-hasty and cowardly Surrender; when  new Supplies were ready just at hand to relieve him: Soli∣cited
and won thereto, as was believed, by the Inticements of a Harlot; for the Expiation of which Crime, the Earl of Leicester soon after put him to death. They who were Im∣partial, called this Discipline; but others imputed it to his Hatred of the Dutch in general; because Rowland York ha∣ving a hand heretofore in the mischievous Counsel of Imbi∣sius, and many oher English, of no better Repute in any thing, at leastwise guilty of Cowardose, not onely came off safe, but were looked upon as fit to be admitted into the grea∣test Trusts: Venloo, a Town nearer to Gelderland, and sci∣tuate on the other Bank, followed Grave, the Common Peo∣ple betraying it, in spight of all the Souldiers Endeavours. In the interim, those loose Bands wasted the Enemies Country, and Prince Maurice, for his first Assay, won Axell by As∣sault; which going from Tornay (this strong Town the United States held in the Coasts of Flanders) he got by Night, get∣ting thereinto with Ladders. But the War, in the Bishoprick of Colen, whereof somthing was spoken before grew very hot, not so much by the great∣ness of the Forces as the expert Valour of the Captains: For now Collonel Schenck had left the Duke of Parma's Service, and was gone over to Truxius; this man won and got For∣tresses every where, and destroyed with Fire and Sword what∣soever was subject to the Command of the Bishop thereof: Afterwards, by the Command of the Earl of Leicester, he Fortifies the Isle called Graveward, which lyes upon the left hand of Holland, just at the dividing of the Rhine, and now that is the best Defence of all those Quarters under that Go∣vernment: But the Count Nienarius, who was Commander in Chief in those Parts, took by surprize, and on a suddain, Nuiss, a Town famous for its Antiquity; for which the Duke of Parma, intreated by the Bavarian, and ambitious to con∣tend in Honour with the most Fortunate Captains, did con∣tend: For this place repressed and altered the (before that) most happy Fortune of Charles Duke of Burgundy: But Par∣ma
more Fortunately Assaulted the same, and obtained a glo∣rious Victory, his Entrance into the City being gratulated with Multitudes of Bone-fires: Anon, after this, Alpa Creveceur, and Mursa, being taken into his Possession, he makes a stop at Bergen, defended by Schenck beyond hope and at length was forced to march off, upon the Earl of Lei∣cester's Approach to Zutphen, after the taking of Dewesburg But yet it seemed to him a piece of little less than Cowarde, to stop up the Passages, and Fortifie his Camp: No, like a Noble Enemy rather he returned, bringing with him all his Provision, by this means giving occasion of a Battel; which, In its Issue, proved fortunate enough to the English, had it  been sullied by the Death of Sir Philip Sydney, a young Gen∣tleman, born with the greatest Advantage of all things  as who had honoured the Nobility of his Birth, and greatness of his Wealth, by the true Splendor of all Beautifying Learn∣ing, in this excelling his Uncle the Earl of Leicester, to wh, and his Fortune, how great soever it might come to be in the future, he was intended Successour. Not long after this, Lei∣cester got a Castle over against Zutphen, on the other side the River; which was begun by the Netherlanders; who, being forced thence by the increase and overflowing of the River, left it to be finished by the Enemy. The Charge of  his with all the Land of Welaw, was given by the Earl of Leicester to Rowland York before-named; the Government of Davery which he had before provoked to Madness, by a Garrison  Irish Souldiers, stangers both to Humanity and Civility, upon Suspition of Revolt, he committed to William Stanley; and both these were done against the positive Will of the State who, for divers weighty Reasons, best known to themselves and, as the Event proved, feared the Treachery of those Men. I would not be taken here to accuse the Earl of Leicester of any unfaithfulness; but onely will note, that although he were very stern to others, he was easie to Flatterers and Sy∣phants,
and would give too much credit to pretended Friend∣ships, without any Trial. Nor were these the onely men to be found fault with about him; there were others very inti∣mate with him, and privy to all his Counsels, whose Factious Designs were soon discover'd. Among whom, Ringaltius, one eminent in the Guilt of the Conspiracy, refused all the Tribunals of Judges; until at last, as a Renegado and a Tray∣tor, he ended his infamous Life among the Enemies, in a miserable poor condition: Wherefore, now innumerable Complaints, as it were all at once, were made to the Gene∣rall; returning from the War, to wit, That Warro and Garri∣sons being not possible to be Governed, without the Injury of the Citizens, against this, such should be put into Command as the People were pleased with: And there was added, That the Office and Dignity of Treasurer, or Receiver Ge∣nerall, was given to Strangers, by whom it was deceitfully managed; That the Price and Value of Money was unsetled, and the Souldiers and other Charges of the Common-wealth, were not compared with the Treasury, That the Commands of the Sea was betrayed, by the exhausting the Navall Re∣venues; That Trading and all Commerce decayed; That Ho∣nours were bestowed on those, who in no wise merited them; That the Authority of all inferiour Lieutenancies was destroy∣ed by him; and their Right, so many years maintained, ce∣voured and swallowed up in Garrisons: Nor was it passed in silence, that the Souldiers at that time hired, did not come, (concerning which, there was a Suspition, that the English had been the cause thereof; as willing rather, that their own Forces and proper strength should be brought in) in regard the Numbers of them were small, when the Covetousness of the Commanders or Paymasters had exhausted the Auxiliary Numbers; so much, that they were necessitated to give way to the Enemy, not being able to withstand his Victories. These things were thus related, by Direction of the States then Confederate, who, from that time, began to Assemble, and
meet more frequently than formerly, that those Things might be Transacted without the Senate, which should keep in awe the Guilty Consciences of the English, as Hollanders; and pri∣vately complaining of many Things, both in relation to them∣selves, and to Prince Maurice, they took into their Cogni∣zance and Care most ordinary Matters. This the Earl of Leicester took very ill; that Men from Shops and Taverns, should come to make a Judicatory, who could bring nothing thither with them, but sordid and me∣chanick Arts, and Minds prostituted to Lucre and Gain▪ and that he, a Man of that Birth and Quality, should receive Laws from the Ignorant, and despicable Vulgar, and fight under the Banner and Command of Strangers. Much vexed hereat, he thought it would be a Work well worth his pains, if he could possible, to remove such Clowns from the Stern of Government; for there is nothing more hateful to Nobility, than the Dominion of Peasants, being generally sharp Ob∣servers of Oppressors: And this he thought might the more easily be brought to pass, because Strangers, and the multitude of Citizens, (which is far the greater) having no share in the Government (as was supposed) would gladly hearken to this Equality. But I revolving in my Mind the worthy Precepts of wise men, and antient Forms of Cities, do rather think, that as many as would exclude that part of the People from Ho∣nours, for whose common Utility, the advantage of all things chiefly redounds, do conceit Matters of that difficulty, as are better to be, walked after in Discourse, than Practice: For, not to speak of Nations, Bordering upon the Sea, amongst whom the Commons had the Superiority, the Spartans De∣mocracy as being free from Flattery, equalled almost the greatest Kingdoms: Nor had Rome any peaceable or setled Government, untill the Commons were admitted to have a shre therein.
And, at this day, in many most flourishing Cities, where the Government is Aristocratical, the Ʋnderlings of the Sena∣tors, in the Name of the Common People, exercise all Offices: Neither is this Order forbidden in that Commonwealth, who is indebted to the Water for all it hath; and, by the Dignity of Trades and Merchandizing, grown much greater than of old, so that the whole World hath participated of her Na∣vigations: And all the Wealth is almost in their Hands, whereof an Account is exacted, where Honours are to be bestowed, according to the Judgment of Antient and severe Legislators. And surely, Covetousness and Wealth, are no where less to be suspected, than where the Dominion is not perpetual, and as it were limited within Bounds. But the Earl of Leicester, prepared to alter both these, and other long-continued Practices; not so much in a ridiculous Affectation of Novelty, but that by separating the Nobility, and others, for Wisdom eminent, from the rest, he might draw them into Parties. And first he took to him as Chap∣lains, some Interpreters of Scripture, (for in this Age they alone carry the liars and Affection of the Multitude) such as were eminent for their outward Profession of Zeal, and dif∣fered from others: For, at first, in the Commonwealth, Re∣ligion being less esteemed than was fit, was reported to be the onely cause of the Troubles; and things more earnestly longed for, because forbidden, upon pain of punishment, be∣came neglected, when they might be used with Impunity: Reverence to Things Sacred, was, to all that shewed it, dan∣gerous: No Honour was given to Priesthood; nay, there were, who would not allow any Right of Ecclesiasticall Cen∣sures, but would utterly abrogate it; and all this, when they remembred with Canker'd Hearts, and imbitter'd Minds, the Lordlyness of Priests formerly; and so, in a venomous Ma∣lice to Old Things, they made all Things New. But Lie∣cester, on the contrary, by his Example, shewing to them Au∣thority, and other Advantages of England, which they should
enjoy, first won the Applause of his Preachers, and by them gained the Affections of the People; committing and trust∣ing many Affairs of the Commonwealth not to the Magistrates, but to those who were in some way or other conversant with things Divine, or else concerned among the Plebeians; who, though willing, yet could never attain to right use and know∣ledge of things: And now many whose Counsels had been sound and faithful to their Country, were openly put back from their Honours, because they agreed with the Church of Rome, either in all Points, or at least in some; little re∣garding, how this matter would disturb the Peace, if once it were published abroad, That they had received such a Reli∣gion, which would admit of no Companions in the Common∣wealth, except of the same Gang. This had not long conti∣nued, but among the Frizons, and in Utrecht, where the Inha∣bitants had taken away the power from the Magistrates to themselves; and, in other Cities, which had formerly been Tumultuous, and ruled by the too great strength of the Mul∣titude, the Name of the States began to be murmured at, and he cyed up for the onely Vindicator of Religion, the onely Conquerour of their Enemies, and punisher of Intestine Ambi∣tion and Covetousness. Moreover, he placed English Soul∣diers in Forts, Islands, in or near the Sea, and other Bordering Parts: Neither had he less Confidence in Sonojus, who, for some famous Actions, having merited the Government of West-Frizeland, under the Prince of Aurange, now hoped to confirm the same to himself, by the Favour of Leicester, and that he should attain the Command next under his Great∣ness, and so to tear this Province, and some other Garrisons, from the greedy Dominion of Holland, and the Charge and Care of Prince Maurice, who bridled, and hid in a Resolved Silence, the greatness of his vertuous Disposition, when at the same time he was sollicited, to perpetrate most false Crimes, and that under the Vizor of Friendship. Thus pre∣pared, the Earl of Leicester having preferr'd many out of his
own Number, and the Plebeians every where were in doubt of Discords, the greater part of them would follow him, he believed now he had not much to do to possess himself of his desired Dominion; especially, if he continued in the Queens Favour still as formerly. Wherefore, least he might by too long absence, give Opportunity to his Enemies, as knowing the nearest Intrigues of that Court, he goes home: The Reason whereof pretended to the States was, that he was called thence to the Council of England, where he would not forget to help forward the Belgick Affairs: But the Commons were otherwise informed; for to them he pretended the In∣dignities offer'd him by the States, were the cause of his de∣parture, threatning never to return, unless the Face of Affairs were new moulded: And this, together with some Letters scatter'd among the people, inraged many; the matters there∣in contained setting forth either the bitterness of the States, or else Leicester's Merits, and affectionate Endeavours for the peoples good. A Rumour also being spread, that the Queen would not refuse the Dominion and Soveraignty of the Netherlands, unless she, frighted from it by the Experi∣ment of the first Confederacy, and innumerable Laws, Ar∣ticles, and Covenants, whereby even the justest Government was eluded, and came to nothing. By these means, it came to such pass, that at Ʋtrecht the New Magistrates, and in Frizeland the private persons, in the name of the Publique, took the Confidence to send to the Queen Deputies, who should not so much offer as receive from her the Conditions and Form of a Principality: But she absolutely refused them, though the Parliament of England then sitting, promi∣sed, If she pleased, to give some Aids of Money on that behalf: Yet for all this, she could not escape the Suspitions of some, that she had rather have received this Honour from the Sedi∣tions and Tumults of the Souldiers and People, than from the free Consent wherewith it was publikely offered, and by her refused.
The Earl of Leicester now departing, left to the Senate the care of the Commonwealth, but not long after, a Writing was produced, wherein he had reserved to himself the Com∣mand of all Garrisons, and other chief points relating to the Government. Hereupon, some were sent into England, who should complain of their lame form of dominion, and that if any sudden stirs or commotions should happen, there was no present power to remedy the same. But they stayd in England a long time,1587. in regard of some present troubles, wherein that Kingdom was involved. For the Queen of Scotland, being driven out of her Kingdom by her Subjects, fled to the protection of Queen Elizabeth, as a Supplyant, being related to her, by a near consanguinity, beside the allyance of Honour, as her Sister Queen; There she being puffed up with great flocking to her of the Roma∣nists, and believed, or at least imagined to have conceived a hope, not only of regaining her former fortune, but that there was a private kind of danger that threatned the Queens safe∣ty from her, by her laying claim to the Crown; first she i committed into strong Custody; but there, the fear and dan∣ger of her yet continuing, she was at last put to death. In this mean while, among the Hollanders, were bloody tu∣mults, and as either party prevailed, so were bonds and ba∣nishments inflicted; But where William Stanley delivered Davoury, and Rowland York, the Fort opposite to Zurphen, to Taxis a Spaniard, who accepted of the Treachery, but dis∣dained the persons, though both very intimate with the Earl of Leicester; then many of the common people extolled the wisdom of the States, and highly condemned their Treachery. But there were some Englishmen, who to take away the Infamy of their Nation, said it was done by the Command of their Superiors. Yet there was one Allen, afterwards a Cardinall, who though an Englishman, in a Book concerning the same set out, would seem to defend the villany, by the
pretence of Religion; which notwithstanding his defence, remained still as it was, a most perfidious Treachery, and wicked Example, no less scandalous to it self, than fatall to the Authour of it. For after falling out between themselves, it was said, that York, a Man of an undaunted boldness to do any thing, was poysoned, and that Stanley being removed from Daventry, went into Spain, with his Company which he carryed with him, his Pay being taken away and gone. Nor did he find the Rewards he hoped for there, no one daring, or at least willing to lay any Confidence on him. But the Confederate States, taking in their own behalf, the voluntary submission of the People, as well as of the Soul∣diery, that the Calamity wherein the Common-wealth was in∣volved, though for the present great, might be turned to good; they incited Prince Maurice to the affections of his Father, and now in the absence of the chief Governour, they give him the whole Command of the War: Besides, they required both the Governours of Provinces, and the Souldiers, to take an Oath to the States, which hitherto had been neg∣lected, but was by the Traytors, and all other seditious per∣sons, that they might thereby the better conceal their crimes, and by the more ignorant, interpreted to the Honour of the Earl of Leicester, as if it had been the Oath to the Queen. This done, the Edict against Exportations was reviewed, and moderated; so that to the peaceable Provinces, all things but only necessaries for War, might be carried. And to Provinces in Hostility with them, and the places border∣ing thereupon, they might export any thing, but Materials for War and Corn. And this Law was afterward, according as the necessity of the times required, oftentimes enlarged and contracted. At this time, many things were done in the Netherlands, with much variety and charge of Fortune; for the Provinces
of Brabant and Flanders, by the smallness of Trade, little converse, and the perpetual lying wast of their Fields, being quite exhausted, suffered extreme penury; those men which of late had good Estates, and a sufficiency of Wealth, being reduced to the meanest beggery, ready to starve for want; yet this fear, and the Royalists Forces lying round about them, were hardly able to restrain the People from revolting. On the other side, you might see the Towns of Holland, enlarg∣ing themselves within their forbidden bounds, and without; and in the Sea-Ships lye up and down on every Coast. And really, I think this almost to be the only Nation which hath thriven by Trading and Commerce, more in the War, than it could have done in time of Peace, and therefore to be ac∣counted most fortunate, if the beginnings its of greatness had not been held back, and wasted by civil discords (while they had also a powerful Enemy within their bowels) the usuall end of old States, and decaying Fortunes. Altapen, a Captain of the Spanish Party, after he had drawn over the Town of Geldres, whence the whole Province of Gelderland takes its name, with the Governour thereof, by Covenants, was slain at Boisledue, by Count Hohenlo: he left him a Castle to take near the Town, which from that slaugh∣ter committed there, took the name of Crevicour. But the Duke of Parma, with a violent, and almost incredible force of Guns, and other Warlike Engines, mightily weakened and damnified Sluys, a Town by him then besieged, in the furthest Coast of Flanders by the Sea-side, that fronts Zeland, an Isle, called Catzen, lying on the back thereof. Which when the Earl of Leicester understood, returning without any de∣lay, he resolves but in vain to break into the Haven; but when his mind was altered, going to Ostend, because of the Enemy, he pitched his Tents, and fame increasing the num∣ber of his Army (whose bigness was not yet known) it ap∣peared at last, that each of them had been afraid of the others Forces more than they needed: The Earl of Leicester
marching away first, imputed the losse of the Town, which was very ill resented by all, not to the Enemies valour, nor the endeavours of their party, yet not well agreeing, in re∣gard of suspitions: for now his whole study was anew to prosecute and revive the long covered, and almost forgotten dissentions, and to lay the fault upon the States. To this purpose, he gives out, that when he went about to repell and drive away the Enemy, that both Souldiers, Mony, and all things else were afforded him with evill will; and what at last they sent, was hardly enough for Garrisons and Forts, not proportionable in any respect for an Army: And if their poverty was such they could afford no more, why did they still involve the Common-wealth in such a desperate Case, to the mischiefs of an unhappy and lingring Warre? for now the Spaniard began to use his accustomed Policies after Victory, and the Queen her self seemed to incline to Peace: although a Fleet sent out under the Conduct of Captain Drake, by wasting and spoiling the Coasts of Spain declared to the World, how weak that Kingdom was at home, that was feared so much abroad, and another Fleet un∣der Cavendish, had roved over another Coast of America, and fallen upon the Molucca Islands, bringing away great advan∣tage: But many things now frighted her, being a Woman, and growing into years, as, the frequent Rebellions of the Irish, who had now in the Belgick Warres become well skill∣ed in Military Discipline; That Scotland was suspected as a private foe, while the Spaniard declared himself a publick E∣nemy; That France had no kindness for her, and not a few in England were desirous of novelty. But the States, know∣ing how much it had otherwise prejudiced their Affairs, throwing off, as much as they could, any mention of a Trea∣ty: if the Treasury could be faithfully managed, they de∣nyed the annual pay of thirty Florens (for that was properly the Wages of all the Forces, except the English Auxiliaries, and Souldiers for Sea-Service) to be despised as such an in∣considerable
allowance, when the Prince of Aurange had oftentimes brought greater matters to passe, with less charge and fewer men; adding further, That wise and considerate  knew how to make the best use of a little, whereas when men ca lightly and easily by money, yet they are never satisfied, though they have too much. Afterwards, some Letters of the Earl of Leicesters, to his Friends, being found, wherein they were accused, that they had forgot their duty, and unjustly busied themselves in mat∣ters of importance, not belonging to them; they, to wit, the States, do by an Edict set forth and declare, that of old, the Peoples Right was in them, and of late, the Princes Right was translated over to them, that they still kept both, notwith∣standing the delated Lieutenancy, and divers other things they spoke of, relating to the honour of their Convention, and whereby they might clear themselves from the objected crime of ambition. But Leicesters hopes were now grows higher, than to stand upon delaying niceties and policies that were understood; wherefore scorning, that the People should any longer have a voyce among the Magistrates, with an ha∣sty over-ruling Confidence, he prepares by faction and Gar∣risons, to bring under his Yoak, the Cities that stood more inward upon the Land, and thence to throw a sudden terrour upon the rest, not taking warning by the example of Valois, whom such an endeavoured violence thrust out of the Go∣vernment, though setled therein by Contract and Agreement. But before the danger, the whole Plot laid by the Inhabitant strangers of Leyden was discovered, many of whom, suffered death as a worthy punishment, for seeking to induce novelty in a State, where they were strangers. And although per∣chance some of these might be offenders, rather out of igno∣rance than malice, yet was that severity towards them very necessary, and broke the whole design of all, either begun or intended, commotions; Thus at last being openly discover∣ed guilty of an unworthy and unlawful ambition, he went
away into England. And there the Queen, after she had sent the Lord Buckhurst, no great Friend of his, to inquire in∣to the Affairs of the Low-Countries, that the less notice might be taken thereof in the Council, protected him by her Royall Power, yet made him to abjure all Authority over the Ne∣therlands. But while he yet supported his old Partakers with Letters, and was after laid aside from Military Affairs by England, he lived not out a full year, uncertain whether taken off by his Wives Treachery, who, as it were, confessed her Adultery in his Life, by her unequal Marriage after his death, or by any other means unnatural, or the common Fate. However it was, his death was not so much lamented by the Queen, as it was rejoyced at by the Low-Country men, who were thereby once more freed from a Danger, than which, a greater, in all their Affairs, never hung over them. In the interim of these Affairs, Collonel Schenck took by Surprize Bonne, a City of Germany, scituate on this side the Rhine, and then possessed by the Bavarian. Now was there (as one may say) a Cessation of Arms throughout the Ne∣therlands; for the Duke of Parma did not, as he was wont, with so much intention break in by War upon those Discord∣ing Provinces. A great Design against England had taken his Thoughts and Endeavours, it being accounted a more no∣ble, and less difficult Enterprise. Most of the great Souldiers, who had fought for the King of Spain, looked upon that Island as the amends of their Me∣rits, and the Reward of their Labours; and as it was near to France and Germany upon occasion of War, so the Counsel was, That being a Transmarine Kingdom, it should be gotten by War: But these Counsellors, every one by his own For∣tune, or by Death hindred, at this time, as it were by the Ju∣stice of Revenge, after a League concluded, & Aid sent open∣ly to the Rebels in Ireland: A great Fleet was prepared in Spain against the next Summer; The Duke of Parma prepa∣red all his Garrisons against that time to man it; and so far
did his hopeful Imaginations carry him, that he concluded this English Expedition would be a worthy Catastrophe of his Ten Years Victories, and make his Name equal in the Regi∣ster of Honour, with those of the most famous Emperours. But the Spaniard endeavoured to stifle the Rumour of this immi∣nent Danger, with the Noise of a pretended Peace; For the composing whereof, the Dane, as a Mediator, came to pro∣pound Mediums; and Cains Ransovius sent to the Duke of Parma, whom the Souldiers of Holland intercepted by the way, as he passed with a Warlike Train, and not distinguish∣able among those that fought: But the King adjudging that they wittingly had, contrary to the Laws of Nations, viola∣ted his Ambassador; and chiefly, because his Letters were broke open, took so sharp a Revenge, that he laid an Arrest  Restraint upon seven hundred ships, that were passing back∣ward and forward in Trade for Corn; by which means,  the people then living in these parts, were wonderfully terri∣fied with the fear of Famine, having never before, by any like Example, been disturbed. But this Scarcity was helped by necessary Counsel, that French and English Vessels coming from the same Seas, should go to the Ports and Markers of Holland. Thus was that Danger escaped, onely with the Ex∣pence of some Money, forced from them by the Danes; which notwithstanding, and for that the King would not vouchsafe to give Audience to the Embassadors. sent to him, stuck highly in the Stomachs of many, who thought it very hard, that the Lesser Dominions should still be obnoxious to Damage, at the will and pleasure of the greater. While these things were doing there, there was likewise a kind of Trey with the English in King Philip's Name, because the Queen was looked upon as the onely Support of all the Low-Country Affairs, to this purpose. That all Jealousies and Fears should be thrown away in the laying down of Arms, if the Provinces which had Rebelled would return to their pristine Obedience; Th as she took off all things concerning Religion in England, so in the
Netherlands Religion should be ordered according to the Mind of the Spaniard, though there had been taught a pernicious Doctrine, that Matters relating to Religion, were to be determined by other Judges than Princes. This proposed Pacification was listned to by Queen Elizabeth, with no less Subtilty than it, was of∣fered, chiefly aiming, that by this Pretext of Compounding Business, she might spin away, and divert the time of dan∣ger, for she now had Intelligence of the Fleet. And dissembling her Fear, she onely pretended a pious desire of Peace and Commerce among, and with the Provinces; and, to that end, sending some so instructed out of England, to command the Hollanders, that they should, without any murmuring, hearken thereto, and that they would draw upon themselves so great Envy, as to be esteemed by their cruel Obstinacy, the Authors of perpetual War and Bloud-shed. But they revolved with themselves, and a fresh remembred all the Treachery Blan∣dishments of the Spaniard; for what Event had the Treaty with Requesens, but that all the Forts being taken, the more considerable Cities might the easilyer be besieged? At the Pacification at Colen, how was the hopes of a reall Peace blast∣ed, by solliciting so many Provinces to Revolt; and so was Flanders, by the like kind of Colloquies, betraid: And at last, the Enemy got so much Recruit of strength, while he falla∣ciously promised Tolleration of Religion, that now he dares absolutely deny it. Now to speak of Peace, when there were such Civil Discords among the Citizens, were just to strike their Arms out of their Hands, that others might, as they saw convenient, submit to what they pleased; but let heed be ta∣ken, that they used not more hast than good speed. And though things might be composed upon equal Terms, yet neither the League made at Gaunt, nor Don John's Treachery could be forgotten. That to Kings, whom the Bishops of Rome would dispence with, or absolves from the Sacred Tye of an Oath, every Covenant made with Subjects, would be reckoned all one as a Victory.
And there would never be wanting men, that would seek, to raise themselves and their Fortunes, by the slavery of their Country: And in these things, every one openly, as doubt∣ful, spent the time, because they saw she perswaded to Peace that might compell. And as often as the Queen per∣swaded them not to delay, they beseeched her, That she would not cast off that Cause of God and Men, and leave Threescore Ci∣ties and a People, ready, if their present Treasure were not enough, to increase the Publike Stock with their private Wealth, a Prey to the Malice and Avarice of the Treacherous Spaniard. Here∣upon the Cities unanimously agreed, (for this Consultation was related to every particular City) That no Embassador, should be sent to the Enemy: Onely the Queen, Winter grow∣ing on apace, sent into Flanders, to make, if she could, a Peace, though not suitable to her Wishes. Here, while they discourse of the place of the meeing, and of their Commissi∣ons, the English asking a Truce, the Duke of Parma defiying, Three Moneths are elapsed: Queen Elizabeth demanded for the Netherlanders Pardon, their Antient Laws and Go∣vernments of their Cities; for her Self, the continuance of the Old Leagues, the Re-imbursement of all her Charges, and Security for the same, the Souldiers on both sides being dis∣banded: But as to Religion, and the Form of Worship, she moved so faintly, as if she would seem not to meddle there∣with. For now she was come to this, That she onely desired two years for the performance of her Demands: As to the Towns, which the English held, either by Covenant, or other Occasi∣ons, she refused not to deliver them, upon the Receipt of her Chrges. The Spaniards, while they utterly deny any Tolleration of Religion, and will have all Affairs of the Netherlands left to King Philip's pleasure; objecting, instead of payment of the English Disbursements, That thereby the English had been the cause to them of greater Expence; and as they extenuate that, they amplifying other Things, did now appear plainly to the
World, that though they sought a Treaty, yet they never in∣tended a Peace: And Arguments of their Hostile Dsigns, and Warlike Preparations, every day broke out clearer and clearer; until at last, the so long feared Flet, set an end to the one sides hope,1588. and the other sides dissi∣mulation. But Dissention and Factions, with By-names, went not out of Holland with the Earl of Leicester; but under this pretence, the Garrison Souldiers, both of Cities and Ca∣stles, made Disturbances, robbing and pilling every where; especially they, that, by ill-ordering of the Treasury, were behind in their Pay, for fear of Peace, hasted by Rapine to repay their Labour in the War. At which time, some were pleased, that the third part of Pay should be offer'd, which by the Custom of the Netherlands is always in Bank, and ne∣ver used to be disbursed, but upon very good occasions: Which, because it could not speedily be obtained, in regard it was the Remains of many Years, and to be demanded of many, they forthwith every one took to himself, what Liber∣ty or Licentiousness he pleased, being defended a while by some English the Queen had sent; As if the Name of Eng∣lish, would have made these Crimes pass more currant: The Souldiery of Geertruydenburg, upon the receiving a great Sum of Money, seemed cotented; but into what an unly Baseness and Teachery, they afterwards backe on I wlim its proper place relate. Sonoi, in the City of Medem like, ci∣tuate on the Western Shore of the Frizian Gulph, by the Rebel∣lion of his Souldiers against him, suffer'd the punishment of denying Obedience to Superiours; Prince Maurice by Siege, reduced these to the Obedience of himself and the States. s∣sel also, Governour of the Garrison in Flushing, hoping to command in Chief all the Souldiers in Zeland, and drawing to his Party Veren and Armuyden, Towns in the sle of Wl∣cheren, with an Ambition of Rule, was at length,  Queen's Commands, who understood he things a  Renunciation of the Earl of Leicester, which now
heard of, forced to desist. In other places, the Seditions were appeased with less danger, but every where with great Ex∣pence of Money. These things, though not bursting out till the following year, I have mention'd in this place, because they are coherent with the matter. But before I settle my self, to proceed in my impartial Relation, of the following Troubles, I think it will be a digression, both satisfactory and pleasant to the Reader, if I take a short View chiefly, of such Domestick Affairs of our own, as is necessary for other Nations to come to the knowledge; such as was that War, when a few People, and they living in a narrow compass of Land, and shaken with many grievous Slaughters, should yet raise it self to such a Greatness, against so mighty a Power as that of Spain. Therefore, I will compare what Bounds, what Form of Commonwealth, what Number of Forces, and what Natural Dispositions, and Inclinations, were in this middle Time most usual, with both these People. After the Liberty confirmed by the League at Gaunt, Don John of Austria had Conquer'd Namur, Lutzenburg, and Limburge; The Duke of Parma gained by particular Agree∣ments Artois and Henault; by Treachery he obtained Flan∣ders; and Brabant and Mechlin he subdued by Famine, except∣ing that in Flanders the Town of Ostend; in Brabant Berge∣op-Zoom and Williamstedt, (so called from the Prince of Au∣range) together with some Castles, all lying upon the Sea-Coast, or by the sides of Rivers. Frizeland and Over-Issell, were in the power of the Ʋnited States, onely the Spaniard had Groningen: The rest, Steanwic and Daventry excepted, with as many other Fortresses, were divided with the Enemy; And they wanted not many Towns in Gelderland, besides Arnheim, Geldres, Niumegen, Zutphen, principal Cities, and some less Carrisons held by the Spaniard. Prince Mau∣rice did wholly govern and Zeland; after the rest, there came under his Command, beyond the Frizons, the Dominion of the Sea, and all other places, which continued faithful to the
States in the Enemies Country. They took away every where the great President, of having proper and peculiar Governours in Cities, suffering none such, but in the very uttermost Bor∣ders: Nor must I omit to say something of their Neighbors. Beyond the River Eomes, is the County of East-Frizeland, commonly called Embden-Land; By the Maes and Rhine, the Bishopricks of Colen and Leige, the Governour whereof a Bavarian, a Kinsman of King Philips, who encompassing al∣most all the Belgike Provinces, by divers Names of Ecclesia∣sticall Dignities, possesseth most large Territories; and although the Court of the Prince of Cleves and Juilliers, had not yet been claimed by War; yet either by infused Dread, together with the pretence of the Burgundian Alliances, it seems to in∣cline towards the Spaniard; and then if any of those Cities should fall to the like Religion as the Hollanders, they had an Enemy close by them, that would be no less implacable than theirs. But Cambray, which, after the Defection of the Neighbour Cities, being clogg'd and annoy'd with its own Garrison, Valois had, by his last Directions, commended to the Kingdom of France his Protection; Baligny, who was ap∣pointed Governour thereof, by the King's Mother, Catharine, kept after both their Deaths; and he now joyning himself to the Guisian Faction, while the Duke of Parma rejoyced at the prolonging of the War, thereby to recover satisfaction for the wasting of the Country; and King Henry, driven out of his own Cities, had no peace nor vacant time to mind these beginnings, took to himself an Authority, though he knew it could be of no long continuance: These were their Bounds and Limits. Now let us consider their Polity; the Ʋnited States, among whom the Prince of Aurange, for a long time, had the chief Authority in the King's Name, and then in his own; afterwards, both his, and the States Power, sliding into the Earl of Leicester's Dominion, were taught by Experience, that the strength of the Empire, divided into many Hands, though it may suit better with Liberty, yet is it more subject
to discord, if the fear of the publick Enemy be but abated; but the Government it self lost nothing, for what was sub∣stracted by any means from its power, was doubly regained in the benevolence and affection of the People, for Honours and Licences were wholly granted by it, whereas Impositi∣ons of Taxes and Subsidies, and other burthens were laid up∣on the People by another hand. And besides, such is the na∣ture of the common People, that they will generally lay the fault of all miscarriages upon those who are most active in the Common-wealth, and yet for Victories they will only acknow∣ledge one. The Nobles and more potent men, were wont by an anti∣ent Custom, according to the hereditary right of their Pos∣sessions, to govern the Country, and the Inhabitants therein, but Towns were left to be ruled by selected and choyce Citizens; and the Reason was, because the People imploy∣ing themselves in multiplicity of Affairs, did not desire to be called together, and assembled upon every occasion of electing Officers, or making Laws; but out of them forty, or sometimes fewer were picked, who afterwards meeting together, did consult and deliberate of all things that con∣cerned the Commonwealth, and these were called, The wise and sober men. And if death or banishment, took any one or more of them away, others are forthwith chosen into the va∣cant places, who are eminent for their Prudence and Riches; and the Laws and Ordinances made by this Assembly or Common-Council, are, by the Consent of the whole City, obliging to all, so that it is hardly found in an Age, that any People gainsay them, but are ready rather to fight in defence of the Authority of their Governours. These every year nominate severall, out of whom are cho∣sen Praefects, (this Power formerly belonged to the Prince) who are to maintain and defend the publick Peace, and are called by the People, Masters, and these at most were four. There are seven others, that are called by the name of Esche∣vins,
do passe Judgment in all differences of private con∣cernment, as likewise in criminall matters: These Offices are undertaken and performed as a duty incumbent upon them in behalf of their Country, with little or no Reward or Salary: And to these mens Power, and the Counsel of some that are their Assistants, who must be well read in the Civill Law, all the business of Towns and Cities is referred, and by them dispatched, with this additional Power allowed to them, of making Laws, and raising moderate Sums of mony within the verge of their own Jurisdiction; from hence the whole Empire, as it were, assembling these Chiefs together in one Body, they who before singly governed the Parts, thus associated and conjunct, do praeside and rule the whole Nati∣on. For three or four times in the year, or oftner, as the E∣mergencies of Affairs require, there is a Council summoned out of both degrees of the People, which is called the Con∣vention of the States: But the Nobility, because they cannot easily meet from their several Remote Habitations, have conferred their Power and Authority upon some few, whose Riches and Honour is greater than the rest, and they meet in that Great Council in the behalf of all. To these, in respect of their Quality, is only given the priority of suffrage; for every one of the meaner Ranks have a Vote equall to them: When therefore the Common-Council of any Town hath deliberated at home, concerning matters there proposed, the Magistrates, and some of the Assistants, are sent to the great Convention, to give them ac∣count of what they have so done, and thereupon to obtain their permission: all other things that may happen, either by accident or conveniency, are left to their Prudence and Fi∣delity. Wherefore in this great Assembly, as all things are discussed, which formerly the Princes used to take care and Cognizance of, so they assess what Taxes, Assesments, or other Customs, are necessary every year, for the bearing and carrying on the Burthen and Charge of the War, which is
proportionably rated upon every Province according  their Forces. But because this Great Convention is ag quickly dissolved, the Nobility and chief Magistrates of great Cities, may chuse fit men out of themselves, that they sitting at the Helm of Government, may put in execution the Ed, and Decrees of the States, and oversee all other quotid business, and in sudden Cases to provide remedy; and  any thing happen, that requires a greater care, they may by a Proclamation in Writing, summon the Great Assembly of the States: This Honour doth generally continue but for time limited; But the Dignity of Advocate of Holland, is per∣petuall. He in the times of the Princes was the only assertor of the Publick Liberty, and as then is dangers, so now, the form of the Commonwealth being changed, he is in the Conver∣tion of the States, and in the meetings of the Deputies, he de∣mands their Advice and Judgment, he by perswasive Speeches draws points to a head, and composeth any diffe∣rence like to fall out among them: This Office was executed very prayse-worthily, from the beginning of the War, by Paul Busius: and after him John Olden Barnevelt had the same, and much honoured the same by his proper vertues, whereof he gave a most excellent Testimony against the Earl of Leicesters Threats and Policies, manifesting himself both a faithfull Counsellor, and a person of an invincible Spirit. This is in effect, the Form of the Government in Hol∣land, from whence the Customs of other of the Provinces, are not much different. Every place hath its proper Over∣seers of all penalties and forfeitures belonging to the publick Treasury, and Judges, who are men well skilled in the Laws, to whom Appeals might be made from the inferiour Courts of the Town. These are they who obtain all lasting and con∣tinuall Dignities, out of whose number, a Prefect is chosen, and these are always nominated by the States only. But now, the Senate takes Cognizance of all things relating to the con∣federated
Union, and provides all-things necessary for the War; and all that are admitted into it, do swear, That with∣out any respect of them from whom they are sent, they shall ad∣vise what shall be most advantagious to the Publick good. Now it is to be observed, that hither are sent from every Province some, particularly from Holland three, from Zeland two, from Frizeland the like; and from every one of the rest, one. Hi∣thet, when there is any more grave and serious matter to be debated, the Governours of Provinces are sent for and admitted: But because matters of the greatest concornment, were from all Antiquity, never dispatched, without the consent of e∣very severall Province, and that was found, by reason of the infinite multitude of business, and the hazard of long delays, to be inconvenient; therefore it was agreed, that Deputies should be sent with free Commission, who should always at∣tend the chief business of State; and if any thing hapned there, that required more deliberate Consultation, and meri∣ted maturer judgement, that forthwith every one should con∣sult the States of his own Province. Every Province, which now according to the League, sends out of their chief Cities some, hath an equall right of suffrage; And by turns, they successively come to be Presidents. And at that time, these were the Provinces, Guelderland, Holland, Zeland, Ʋtreche, Frizeland, within the Ʋlye and the Lecke, and Over-Issel. This Deputation hath by little and little assumed to it self the nature of a perpetual Assembly, resembling the Confede∣rate or United States, and doth frequently use that name. And the Power here included, and vested in the Deputies for a prelimited time, is not prolonged, unless by the pleasure and Authority of their Superiours, by whom they were in∣trusted. In like manner, others of an inferiour Rank, are chosen for Sea-Ports, and other Towns lying on the Sea-Coast, who are by their Judgments and Counsels, to order and settle all Navall matters.
This in brief, is the Method and Form of that Common∣wealth; nor is it congruous, only to mind the meaner sort which means, as the Government grows famous, being  bounded among a few Families, so neither is altogether popular, as to be made up out of the multitude. The Autho∣rity of the Nobles being left to themselves, and all our power residing in the chief Citizens of the more Noble Ci∣ties. Hence as it were, by certain steps were they elected who were to govern the Provinces, and to look after all other publike business, not as in a meer Democratical form, by promiscuous and accidentall choyce, but by having a rega to their descent and Progenitors, the acquisition of their Wealth, and their other laudable dispositions, and vertuous qualities: Nor was the Provision for securing liberty herein▪ any whit mistaken, while things of greatest difficulty and concernment, were ordered by the judgment of many, and the chiefest Authority passeth from hand to hand, which s the cause, that many without the hope of continuing their greatness, have made it their study, to learn and put in pra∣ctice the true manner of well governing. I have found it an experimented truth, even when Wars were maintained a∣gainst the Romans, that the People both of France, Germany, and Britain, were wont to examine and discuss their more weighty matters, by the Peers of the Land, and such choyces made by the Cities, and that some remainders thereof ap∣pear, even where Kingdoms have been since long setled. But if we may dive into Records of greater Antiquity in Greece, we shall find the like settlement among them, under the name of Amphyctiones, by whose unanimity, the almost incredible power of the Median Monarch, was both resisted and con∣quered. And so in Achaja, whose strength at first, though inconsiderable, yet by an harmonious Agreement waxed for∣midable. But to proceed, though every Province hath a Metropolitical
City of its own; yet now the chief and common Seat of Empire, is among the Hollanders, who as they far out vye the rest of their Confederates in Wealth, so they do not a little go beyond them in Authority. The Hague is a Village, and the Seat of Prince Maurice, exceedingly and choycely pleasant, with delightful Woods and Groves, and its neigh∣bouring Bank. The State of the Commonwealth, in the Provinces under the Kings Command, differeth not much from the other, but that the great Assembly of the States, for those parts, are sel∣dom called together, except it be for setling of Taxes, and raising Mony; some few are selected to manage the private Affairs of every Province: but the Senate with the Regent, and the rest assistant thereunto, as the Judges of Law and Treasury, have the whole Government of all things; and whoever is admitted into any Office, he continues therein without alteration or change. The Revenues of the United Provinces, what they were, is before declared: afterward when they had shaken off all fear of Tyranny, they began to settle Tributes for their own Commonwealth, and when their Trading and Merchandizing encreased by the decay of Brabant, their Spirits were aug∣mented as their Riches, and their undertakings were at∣tended with success; their confidence boldly venturing upon the greatest attempts, enlarged their charges and expences: their Fields, Houses, Victuals, Cloaths, nay their very Heads were not free, but made lyable for payments of Mony. They had the Sea open to bring them most certain Customs, which not lyable to the hazard of War, as other things, though it was the endeavour of those in Power, not to hinder Trassique, if possible, least Commodities of great value might by incertainty and hazards be carryed else∣where.
But the Wealth of the Spanish Provinces, though consisted much of Taxes, very hardly, and with an ill will gotten,  by the accession of great Sums of Mony from the King, of exceed very far the other; but that the multitude of  who were interested in the receiving and payment of the same, and the easiness of fraudulent dealing therein, inter∣cepted and devoured the greatest part thereof, before it ca to the uses for which it was designed, while some of the would keep it as their own, and others as profusely and pro∣digally wast it. The Souldiery of the Hollanders, consisting of Citizens, Allyes and strangers, besides the Auxiliary English Forces▪ did not at this time exceed eighteen thousand Foot, with a indifferent Cavallery, the greatest part of whom, lay in Ga∣risons, and were far short of their Enemies in multitude, before France had made him divide his strength: But the Earl of Leicester's neglect, and their other many Seditions, had taught them, that it was better and more safe for them, to defend themselves with small Armies, than by exceeding their Treasure under the name of Souldiers, to raise them∣selves enemies. And now every day they brought their Dis∣cipline to be more strict, that those Citizens and neighbour∣ing Provinces, and others that redeemed their Lands, lying partly in the Enemies Country, from spoil and pillage, by paying mony for Composition, might not be injuriously ve∣ed; and when the Souldiers were drawn into Winter Quar∣ters, they were not to take any mony under-hand, while they were there, but the Commonwealth did defray all char∣ges during their stay; by this equality a wonderfull thing was brought to passe, that every house was glad and willing to entertain them. All the Infantry was divided into Regi∣ments, (for so we will call them,) every Regiment contain∣ing ten Ensigns, and seldom more. Under every Ensign, were to march an hundred men; 'tis true, some Companies were at first greater; but, if you will look upon them ge∣nerally,
what with Death, and running away, and what with the Captains false Musters, they hardly arose to that Num∣ber. Every Troop likewise was to contain so many Horse∣men, and three of these Troops, as it were a Wing, had but one common Commander. And that all these might with the more ease be paid, every Province took to themselves certain Companies of Foot, and Troops of Horse, to whom out of their proper Treasure, they constantly gave their Pay: And as every Province thus an∣swer'd his proportion, so they began a new Custom, which was, That they would in Vacancies, name the Captains, and other inferiour Officers under their Pay. The Captains themselves managed the meaner Services; but they who governed the Commonwealth, either for their Vertue, or out of Favour, would appear in such as were more eminent. The Forces of the Enemy were much more numerous than the other, where∣by they kept in awe, what, or whosoever they suspected, and guarded their Borders, though of a very great Extent. The Common Souldiers Pay was alike on both sides; but they had greater and more extraordinary Advantages with the Spaniard, with whom also there were a great number of per∣sons who had double Pay; yet were they not less burthen∣some, either to Towns or Countries, whether in the Camp or in Garrison, so that they were more than doubly destructive to the Treasury: And their Military Discipline was much neglected by their private Emulations. On the contrary, Prince Maurice, upon whom, chiefly, the whole Care and Weight of the War lay, pretermitted none of those things which had been used by Antiquity in the Art Military, or that were grown Customary by Modern Practice and Experience: He diligently encouraged his Souldiers, to attend all the Enemies Motions; and though he sat in the Highest Seat of Power, yet he would not suffer the meanest things to pass without his Care: So that it was admirable, to see this great and Warlike Instructor, who had
never had any Master, by discreet Considerations, establish all things for the War, that Guards might be diligently kept, and Cities well Fortified; he causes sound men to instruct the Souldiers, how readily to pitch their Camp, and to use all sorts of Engines and Instruments for Assaults; and in re∣gard they were yet unexperienced in Battels, Sieges, and Forti∣fications, he hath them caught to manage Horses, to observe their Ranks, to carry Provision, and to raise Works, not ac∣cording to the Method of this Age. At first, these Endea∣vours were laughed at, by the Ignorance of those who are ashamed to learn what they understand not; but after the Success of some Experiments, they were admired; because hereby they that had turned their Backs in many Fights, now durst stand and look the Enemy in the Face, and reduce by strength Towns that they had lost: So that now all did plain∣ly confess, That as no man excelled his Father, in gaining the love of the People, and laying the Foundation of a Commonwealth; so by the great Blessing of Heaven, the Son was as famous, for the increasing and defending the same. But how much the manner of the War was alter'd from the first use, will easily be un∣derstood in the Context of the following Work. A consider∣able Number of Ships are sent to infest the Enemies Towns that lay by the Sea-side, and to guard the Passages of Rivers: Some go out, as a safe Convoy for Merchants, and to secure the Fishing Trade: Others sail up and down, to scour the Sea of Pyrates: Without all doubt, in this, the Enemy was inferiour, who had very few Ports, and they incommodious, and not many Ships, which onely waited upon Towns. The Nobility on both side, either contented themselves in an un∣profitable carelesness, or the peaceable enjoyment of their Honours, with a kind of Neutrality for Envy, of the Com∣mons on one side, and of the Spaniards on the other; or else out of an inveterate Stupidity, because some cunning Princes, changing the Execution of their Military Offices, into He∣reditary Possessions, had taken all from them, and given them as
a Favour to the other. Some few there were, that either out of Love and Thirst of Renown, or their particular Discontents, did take up Arms, and do Service suitable to their Births and Qualities. Among the Commons, the young men, and such as onely knew the Evil of the present Times, because they had never seen Peace, were content with any condition of Affairs, not being sensible of the War, otherwise than by Rumors, and paying Taxes; and many, because the Religion publikely received was not affected by them, for no other cause, followed the Cry. But the Laws of Holland, though many of them not very harsh in their Sanction, did sorbid to the Catholikes, even the use of their Religion in private, not∣withstanding the like Orders had been the cause of so many former Tumults: The same also, by a kind of implicite man∣ner, put them from the chief Honours: But the States allow∣ed some mean Allowance to Priests and Nuns, so long as they lived quietly, because in many places their Possessions were laid wast; but it pleased, by connivance, to suffer the Meet∣ings of other Sects. The Ministers of the Publike Religion, were admitted on neither side into the Council; nay, the whole Throng of Ecclesiastical Persons were beyond the In∣spection of the Magistrates. Finally, if the nearest Troubles had been appeased, there would have been no suddain fear of new ones. On the other side, There was another Party of Netherlan∣ders, whose long Experience, and continual Converse among Troubles, had made them now not gainsay the Causes there∣of. There was onely a Shadow of those Laws in use before the War, nor was the Duke of Parma's Modesty alike con∣stant to all: Some Cities were kept under by Garrisons, but all were cuhed by the Authority of Governours. And although the Bishops enjoyed the Seats, the Lady Regent for∣merly, being the Duke of Parma's Mother, and Alva had setled them in, and many other Things were done for the Jesuits sake; yet the Inquisition, and all punishments inflicted
thereby, were either suspended or moderated, in regard of the War, and respect to the Enemy; because the greatest part having fled, that were Disseuters, the rest had learned to obey, rather out of fear than punishment. On both sides, Traffike and Merchandizing, together with the increase of Work-mens Wages, did readily supply the dearne's of Vic∣tuals, and other Things necessary for Man's Life; and also, the Prices set upon greater Commodities, and the Fruits of the Field, which were somewhat scarce. Among the Hollanders, the Merchants Trade flourished, which is the Nurse of all Inferiour Manufactures; Amsterdam alone equallizing the greatest Mart-Towns, either of this present, or of former Ages. In the mean while, as the Benefits of Peace were re∣ceived, notwithstanding the War, so the Evils thereof were not quite vanished; for Men's Minds were not so much na∣turalized to Cruelty by the use of Arms, as to run into contrary Extreams; For all such as fled hither for safety, and had se∣cured themselves from a necessitated Banishment, by a com∣petent Provision, by the Company and Society of Forreign∣ers, and imitating the better sort of them, no Check of the Laws being able to restrain them, would run into a supersous Excess and Vanity of Clothes and Dyet, until they had by this means drawn in others to the same, to avoid the shame of Poverty, though they were in no way able to bear the same And therefore, then that old and constant simplicity of the Hollanders, and their uncorrupted Frugality, was changed into Luxury and Profuseness, which though it might advan∣tage the Treasure, yet was (I am sure) very pernicious and destructive to all good Manners; because as Avarice, as old overgrown Evil, grows into Confidence, it will not let Na∣tions Conquer'd think so as long as they can live at such heighth. But the Vices of the Enemy, made these seem Vir∣tues, whose more wastful and abominable Prodigality, was  to be curbed even by Poverty it self. The End of the Annals of the Netherlands.
THE HISTORY OF THE Low-Countrey's Affairs; WRITTEN By HUGO GROTIUS. The First BOOK. I Shall here begin to Declare that more setled Course of Affairs, wherein Prince Maurice, having attained the Chief Command of the Army, drew up himself the whole Managery of all Businesses. The Commonwealth had still the same Face, Religion was controverted with like Animosity, the War sharply maintained with equal Obsti∣nacy, and all hopes of Peace utterly laid aside; so that now the Series of Things was indeed, in respect of its Actions,
various, but in it self, not at all intricate: England was as∣saulted by Spanish Forces, and France greedily thirsted after, not with a covetous Eye, or vain Wish onely, but by the sad Threats of a Malicious War. It cannot be denied, but that his Treasury is exceeding great, yet not sufficient to maintain so many Wars at once; from hence becoming sensible, of all the Evils of Poverty. During this time, both the Minds and Forces of the Low-Countrymen, had some ease and respite, Leagues and Alliances were begun with several Kingdome, and in part again broken off: There the Praefects and Gover∣nours often changed, and at last the Regent himself; Confi∣dence not resting assured in the meanness of her Guard, and Treacheries most ignoble abounding every where: Whereas here, by the Vigilance and Ingenuity of one Captain, not onely Danger was escaped, but Arms advantaged; the Na∣vall and Maritime Power increased infinitely, and at once in Strength against the Enemy, and in Reputation amongst others: so that now it might credibly be believed, that in the Equa∣lity of both Parties, the War would now grow doubtful; for this time made it appear, that the smallest things might be waited on with humane hope, and that it was never too late to be helped by a Miracle. I am about to publish, according to the Method of History, what things have certainly been seen and heard; nor am I ignorant, how odious it is afresh to being in mind these things among them, whose Hatred is yet raging; where by the positive and impartial Assertions of Truth, you may happily by the Enemy be accused of Flattery, and to your own Side not seem altogether free from untruths: But the Judgment and Reward of my Fidelity will proceed from Posterity; And if God have, in Mercy, appointed any End to this grievous and bloudy War, it may chance there will be some, who drawing Arguments from hence, may give an Account thereof with greater Security, and more Elo∣quence. In the interim, let it be for the benefit of such, as being far remote from the knowledge of our Troubles, may
know the value of their own Peace, from the Evils suffer'd by others, and may hence learn Documents of War, whereof, though not in Civil Discords, they may the more fortunately make use of against a Barbarous Enemy. But it is very dif∣ficult to set down Things as they were really done, because the absent, many times, are quite forgot, and the present too much praised: As that most offends the Reader, so this makes the Writer more blame-worthy. Besides, the follow∣ing Age doth many times, either out of forgetfulness, or the potency of the Conquerour, leave out, or at least fall short of, the exact Discovery of their Knowledg: But if it be necessa∣ry for those Things to be publikely mention'd, it will be ad∣vantageous to the Writer, that he lived among those, who may well be ashamed, if they allow not to him that Liberty, which they promised to all. Adde also, that many of the Events happen'd hereabouts; and he hath the greater advantage and reason to admire the mean beginnings of this increasing Common-wealth. 1588.THE Great Year, according to the Account of Christendom, One Thousand Five Hundred Eighty and Eight, and which Astrologers had sore-told to be the last of the World, was now come: Certainly, either that Art is vain, and it must be reckon'd among the Follies of our rash Credulities, that we suppose our selves able to comprehend Futurity, or else it is an Errour of such, who do not rightly understand the many vast Intriques of Destiny: As a part of the Caelestiall Threats, the Spanish Great Fleet was looked up∣on, which, while he had Peace with the Turk, and saw France embroiled in a Civil War at Home, he made great hast to set out: For it was not enough, that they who had been Conquerors of so many Kingdoms, and subjected the New World so long, should win a little Nation to their Empire by mutual Conflicts, unless with Scandalous Language, they abused the Government thereof by a Woman. But the English∣mens
Confidence, encouraged the Low-Country men, and the Bulwark of the Sea made the English-men confident to repell Force by Force; for they had not yet forgotten the Names of Saxons, Danes, and Normans; nor were insensible, that whoever entred an Island, seldom failed to win the possession thereof: For the Kings of England, because they had been troubled with Civil Wars, to prevent future danger in time to come, upon like occasions, dismantling all Garrisons, Forts, and Castles, had laid the Kingdom open to Forreign Invasion; Then besides, what signified their weak Bodies, and Minds made effeminate by a long Peace and Luxury, being without Leaders, without Cavalry, against the well-disciplin'd Power of the Spaniard; and those that under the Duke of Parma's Conduct, had for so many years been Victorious? Thus did they threaten Revenge to such as should not assist them, but the rest some Respite should be given to. Now, as it is the Cu∣stom of greedily ambitious and covetous men, promising their Hopes a larger and more extended progress, they destin'd to themselves the interdicted and excommunicated Kingdom of Scotland and Denmark, intending afterwards to make use of English Force, and withall of their Natural Hatred against France, at such time as that Kingdom should be em∣brewed and even lye wallowing in her own Bloud: As for the rest of Europe, divided among so many Petty Princes, and never like to be united or cemented, by any good Corre∣spondence or Harmony, it would of course become a Prey to their Conquering Swords. But men of more serious and modest Judgments could not believe they were so vain, as to promise themselves so great Success, though but in Imagina∣tion; but rather supposed they might endeavour to try their Fortune at Sea against all Nations on the Coasts thereof, and to spread abroad among all People, a great, though not a cer∣tain Terrour of them; or else, for a time, to compell all Py∣rates to keep within their lurking Places, and themselves to bear away all commerce. And the Pope (whose name at this time
was Sixtus the 5th) had encouraged & set on the Spaniard by his Bulls to Conquer England, which the Simplicity of some of her former Kings had made Tributary (as was said) to his Triple-Crown. He therefore following the Examples of many Popes his Predecessors, who first, by the Discords of Princes, had usurped a Right over Kingdoms, and then over Kings themselves, exposed England to the Conquest of whoever would undertake it; as if Queen Elizabeth had taken the Go∣vernment thereof without any Right, and detained the same by the Slaughter of the Nobles, and the slavish fear of the People; urging moreover, besides the Crime of her Heresie, the stain of Bastardy, as being born in Adultery, which had been endeavour'd to be concealed with the Veil of a Di∣vorce. These, and many other things were mention'd in the Ball, inviting all men to be assistant to such an Expedition, and absolving from all Tyes her Subjects, whether of Oath, or othewise; That they should seize and take her alive, if possible; but if that could not be, then to kill her. And, as a Reward, to en∣courage the perpetrating so nefarious an Act, Impunity was granted for the same on Earth, and Pardon from God, and other such like Enormous Fooleries, which now are onely imposed upon the Ignorant, as a Shadow of Power; and in∣deed, are no otherwise looked upon by them. However, this may surely be believed, that there were many principal men in England, who were much troubled at the present state of Affairs there, whose Affection to the Spaniard, Bernardinus Mendosa, who, under the Name of an Embassadour, had lain there for many years, as a Spy in the Court, by his vain Boast∣ings had discovered: But whatever his Thoughts were, it appeared true afterward, that however the English Catholicks might differ in Religion, yet there was none of them so im∣prudent, as to trust their Lives and Fortunes to the undistin∣guishing Sword of a Forreign Conquerour. In all the Parts and Coasts of Spain, and in Italy where the Spaniard had Command, there were raised and armed Twenty Thousand
Men, and One Hundred and Fourty Ships, part of them of an almost incredible Bulk and Burthen, which afterwards pro∣ved the main cause of their Destruction. Among these, there were many Galeons, and Galeasses, which built high, with many Turrets and Cabines, like Cities or Castles ra∣ther than Ships, were Rowed with Three Hundred Oars, co∣ver'd over Head against the Shot, and casting of Darts, or other like things, and their Belly and Sides made very strong, the better to be able to bear the Violence of the Waves: Marriners were hired almost from all Nations to put into them, and they were Victualled with full Provisions for Six Moneths, besides a very great Mass of Coin, provi∣ded for a War at Land, was in them, and Cannon, and other great Guns for the Land-Service, to the Number of Five and Twenty Hundred. And all this Preparation, the Work of so many Years, was publish'd in Print, to their own Glory, and the Terrour of others, that it might evidently appear a suffi∣cient Demonstration of the Spaniard's Wealth and Great∣ness. Now though there were some that would have had Warre proclaimed with a Herald, yet others thought the Right of Claim from the Pope's Sentence, would make out but a lame Title. But so great was their Confidence, that the whole∣some Counsel both of the Duke of Parma, and the Marquess of Santa Cruz, was disapproved; which was, That the first Care should be to get some Part belonging to the Hollanders, be∣cause all Flanders could not yield one safe Harbour for a Fleet, against the Hazards both of Warre, and the Sea: But most advised, That the surest Victory would be gotten by Delay, un∣less the Army were presently landed at the Thames, to assault the City of London. The Charge and Command of this whole Fleet was com∣mitted to Don Alphonso Perez Gusman. Duke of Medina Si∣donia, a Person meriting that Honour, as well by the Nobility of his Bloud, as any other thing whatsoever; and, under him,
many Gentlemen of the noblest Families in Spain, and infi∣nite others of inferior Gentry, had entred themselves as Soul∣diers, but at their own charges, induced as was supposed, not so much by the covetousness, as the assurance of getting very great booties. It was constantly reported, that they divided among themselves, as the reward of their pains in the War, beforehand, as well Honours, as Lands and Houses. There were taken among the spoyls of their Ships, many Ropes, Halters, and other Instruments of death and slavery, which they, as not doubting the Event, had prepared for such as they should conquer. The Spring growing now very forward, they met at Lis∣bone, whence driven into a Haven in Gallicia, they wanted three Ships, which by a cruel Tempest, together with Slaves that rowed them, getting their liberty, were thrown upon the Coast of France; In the mean while, the Duke of Parma, upon whom depended the principal part of the Expedition, with above thirty thousand Horse and Foot, lay in Flanders, having cut great Ditches, for the easier carriage of all his Forces to the Sea-Towns. He had brought thither eight and twenty Vessels, serving to ayd other Ships of Burthen, and to hold his men, besides near four hundred Flat-bottomed Boats, that might without hindrance come close to the Shore, part of them being bought, and the rest built by inces∣sant Labour and working night and day; He had ready also, Bridges for the better and more safe transporting Horses and Men on a sudden, as soon as the Spanish Fleet had entred the Sea; But neither the English or Hollander made any provi∣sion to prevent the danger of so great a War approaching, thinking they had been driven back by the Wind, or else vainly imagining, that Ships of such Bulk and Burthen, would never venter, or run the hazard of their narrow Seas. Finally, some did not stick to affirm, that this was only a Convoy for the Indian Fleets return, although the King of
France, upon very good Intelligence, publickly declared, both the strength and intent of the Fleet. Thus did they flatter themselves with Reports and Con∣jectures, not sensible of the greatness of the danger they were in, till it was afterwards avoyded. The Hollanders, notwith∣standing, mustred all their Ships and Seamen, as well private as publick, and fitted them for War, and when they had so done, they in a manner besieged all the Ports of Flanders, that they might stop the Duke of Parma from coming forth; of the rest they had no great doubt: At last, and almost too late, the Queen, who had hitherto been lulled into security by a Treaty of Peace, now claps all that were suspected to wish innovation in Religion, either into Islands, or Marsh∣lands, and fills the Thames Banks on both sides, whereever it was thought the Enemy might land, with Horse and Foot on a sudden gotten together; She comes also and views, yea by words, encourages the multitude, that made indeed a goodly appearance, but had been much inferiour in the use of their Arms, to the Duke of Parma's Souldiers, if he could have come: However, to animate all, there were some who compared all the Queens actions, with those of the most fa∣mous Women, however fabulous; ny, they did not stick to equall her to Tomyris her self, or the Queens of the Ama∣zons, or that notable piece of Feminine Valour in the same Island of old, Queen Boadicia. Her Fleet, whereinto also she had taken all private Ships fit for Service, She thus disposed. The Lord Seymor, had the Command and Conduct of the lesser Vessels, in the Downs, and at the Thames mouth; the greater being in number one hundred Ships, and which for the most part traded up and down in the Spanish Seas, were in Harbour at Plymouth, from whence, when occasion should be, they could with ease come out to meet and fight the E∣nemy, over whom, the chief Command, as Admirall, was
given to the Lord Charles Howard, Earl of  . The Vice Admirall was Francis Drake, (afterwards Knighted,) a Man eminently famous for his Victories at Sea, the fame whereof, he carryed with him in the compassing of the World, and most worthy in this great danger, to be called by his Country to her assistance. The Enemies Fleet was not far off from England, when the Queen, who herein had been deceived by false Rumours on purpose invented and sent out of Spain, Commands by her Letter, the Lord Admi∣rall Howard, that in regard She was informed, that the Fleet was not coming, or at least would be a long time before they came, that he should unarm and discharge the best of her Ships. He had scarcely performed her Command, before the Spanish Fleet appeared, when it was no small care and pains to the Admirall, to recall his Souldiers, who had without or∣der or fear, taken liberty to be absent from their Quarters and duty, as supposing they had leave to do so. And no less was the Spaniard over-seen, in that he did not immediately fall on, when he might have taken them so unprovided, and at unawares. But the Commanders that were afterwards taken Prison is, though they blamed themselves for that over-sight and folly, yet were heard to excuse the same, by the strict∣ness of the orders laid upon them, and the nicities they were to observe in all points prescribed, then which nothing hath caused the loss of more fair opportunities. For Philip would not have his Fleet run any hazard, untill the Duke of Parma, by putting likewise to Sea, had doubled the terrour of their approach. But the Lord Seymor, and the Hollanders Ships joyning together, kept him close in Dunkirk, that he durst not venter to break through with his smaller Vessels; nor could the Spanish Fleet, though by that means it had escaped the following disasters, come so near the shore, being full of shelves and Quick-sands, as to drive away the Enemies Ships, that were much more light and nimble: And that was a thing of great consequence at that time, that no men did so
much as suspect, that the Spaniards (possessed as it were with a fatall and stupid blindness to their own ruine) had neg∣lected to furnish their Ships with many things which were necessary for them, out of hopes to have them from the Duke of Parma. Now it is to be noted, that his Ships, or the greatest part of them, had few or no Seamen, and the Reason thereof might be, besides the avarice of their Prefects and Gover∣nours, that there were very few Seamen, either bred in, or be∣longing to any of those Netherlandish Cities under his Domi∣nion. And the Baltick Cities were not able to supply the number he wanted; and especially, for that all who were forced aboard by the Spaniards, took the first opportunity they could find to run away. In this Interim, the English Fleet was gotten together a∣gain, and with very much difficulty, and hard Labour, by reason of a cross Wind, at last got out from Plymouth, that they might at a distance annoy the Enemy. In which kind of fight, it easily appeared, whether was more advantageous, the Ships of great and heavy Burthen, or Vessels more nim∣ble and expeditions to turn and wind at all Assayes, for few of the English Ships were equall in bigness, to those of the Spaniard, but being more nimble, and apt to sail, they could at any time get the wind of the Enemy, and either go for∣ward or backward at pleasure; and if the Wind changing, drove them as it were upon the Enemy, by fetching a com∣pass, they eluded their expectation. And now there being a calm, so that the Enemy could easily come forward by the help of their Oars, they did not shoot common round Bul∣lets, but chained shot, wherewith expanding themselves, they not only tore their Sails and Tackle, but broke their Oars: by which means the Spaniards could not come forward, or if they could, yet they kept back, not having a mind to fight. Their Ships were drawn into a long Rank, with extended horns, which as it made their Progress very slow, so also it
made them more lyable to the English Cannon to be spoyl∣ed; And then if any Guns more sharply annoyed them, they drew in their Mooned and crescent Squadrons into the Body of the Fleet, and that one might not go before another, bore less Sayl, neither could this be done altogether with safety, as was experimentally found by them, their Ships often falling foul upon one another, in their making such Tryals. And this hapned to Valdez, a great Spanish Captain, and of the same Family with that Valdez who is memorable for the Siege of Leyden. For a Ship of Sevill, carrying eight hundred men, under his Commadd, fell foul upon another with such impetuosity, that the Fleet was necessitated to leave it, having lost her Mast, that she alone might not hinder the course of the rest. This being encompassed and assayled on every side, yield∣ed it self to Sir Francis Drake, and the Men in her, saved by his mercy, contended in prayse of their Conquerour, even to flattery. At the same time, the best Ship of Biscay, whereof Michael Oquendo was Captain, took fire. Some report, that the Man being a Netherlander, and that either mindful of his Country, or angry that he saw himself suspected, toge∣ther with those that begun the fire, upon the approaching of the flame, leaped into the Sea. Few of the Men were saved, but the lower parts of it, being untouched by the fire, became a booty to the English. Presently after, they missed a Ship of Venice, and severall other smaller Vessels. During this, the English Fleet augmented with Recruits, and the flocking thither of the Nobility, who did strive by their forwardness to manifest their affection to the Queen, was in many divisions spread over the Sea, so that which way soever the Enemy steered his course, he was still sur∣rounded, and in every place torn with continuall shooting; wherewith so much Gunpowder had been spent, that thee began to be a great scarcity thereof; and with that want, they were ever after, during the whole Conflict, oppressed; till
at length, some was gotten from Holland: without which the Kingdom of England at that time could not have bee defended. Now had the fight continued without ceasing, at a distance, for the space of eight dayes (for the English Souldiers being fewer, and not able to cope with the Spaniard, had shunned, by all means, a close fight) and on the eighth of the Ides of August,Au. 6. they were come to the Streights of the narrow Sea, between England and France; Here the English Fleet, which you may remember, I told you be∣fore, was divided, met altogether, containing of Seamen and Souldiers, together eleven thousand, and having left the Ha∣landers to guard the Coast of Flanders: The Spaniards cast∣ing Anchor, waited for the Duke of Parma, and with him some lighter Ships, near to Calais, when he in the mean while, void of all hope, and not knowing what to do, makes proces∣sion about the Churches, attended with many vowes; In this perplexity of mind, whether he aymed at the Lieute∣nancy of Britain, or any higher Title, since it hapned other∣wise, and is variously reported, I will leave it to every mans opinion: But now the Spaniards sent from their Fleet into Flanders, severall Noblemen, among whom, was the Prince of Asculum, (whose Mother careless of her own Credit, had made the King suspicious of his being true born) to consult of the common affair, whose passage being hindred, that they could not return, by that means they escaped that gene∣rall ruine, wherein so many were afterward involved; for by the Queens Command, who now began to be in no doubt, but the Enemy, as soon as the Moon left shining, chusing a duskish night, would if possible, joyn their Forces, in this manner brought a great confusion into the Spanish Fleet, that had set up their rest another night in that narrow Sea. Eight English Ships filled with Engines, containing Stones and Gun-powder, and other combustible matter were, being fust fired, sent among the Enemy, the Sea and Wind both
favouring the Design: But the Spaniards, being mightily amazed with the glistering of the Flame (for they percei∣ved it came towards them, and gave a great Light over all the Sea) cut their Cables, and get out to Sea: In which Surprize, and violent Fear, one of the greatest Ships, com∣manded by Hugh Moncada, entangled with another Ships Cables and forced thereby to a Disorder, was by the Violence of the Sea, and Force of the Wind, driven aground on the French Coast, and there the Sea-men and Souldiers, of whom there were in her, besides those that Rowed with Oars, Four Hundred, hoping for some Relief from the Continent, held the English, now invading and assaulting them with Ladders, in a long Fight, till Moncada, and many others, being kill'd, the Ship was taken, and by the space of three whole hours spoiled. But the Governour of Calais would not suffer it to be bur∣ned, that he might preserve the Shadow of a Friendship, the King of Spain not having yet publikely professed himself an Enemy to France, though it was believed, he had at this time a Design upon that very Town. The King lost there in rea∣dy Money Fifty Thousand Ducats, and Three Hundred Slaves were set at liberty. A few of the Ship-men escaped out by swimming, and were the first that brought into Spain the News of the Miscarriage of the whole Voyage. The Fleet, thus scatter'd with a Panick Fear, is Rallyed again near Gravelin, the next Town of Flanders; and though very much gall'd and batter'd with the Guns, and other Mi∣litary Engines of the English, yet they could not be forced to break their Orders any more: In this Conflict chiefly, the Spanish Design was ruin'd, and brought to nothing; for divers of their Ships being shot through with great Bullets, for that they could neither plug up the Holes or Breaches, nor free them from Water by their Pumps, were swallow'd up in the devouring and merciless Waves; Particularly, one Biscayan Ship, that was very fiercely assaulted, while the Captains
within it, between Valour and Necessity, dissent in Counsel even to their Extremity, was immerged in the Sea. Two Por∣tugeze Vessels, being brought into the Mouth of the Ʋly, (for the Wind had driven them thither, they in vain striving to get out to Sea) fell upon the Coasts of Zealand, as if it had been the Design of Providence, that they who were equal∣ly ingaged in the Danger, should likewise between them di∣vide the spoil. The one of these Ships was called the Philip; the other, was named the Matthew. Didaco Piementel commanded this, and Francisco de Toledo the other, both of them Collonels▪ that, the chief men in it being gotten away in the Ship-Boat, the Flushingers had; but Piementel scorning to fly, and refusing the Boat sent to him for that purpose, after he had, with the loss of many of his Men, endured great Extremity from their Guns, deliver'd himself Prisoner to the Power and Protecti∣on of Peter Douse, who being Commander in Chief of the Holland Ships in these Parts, hung up in the Church at Ley∣den an Ensign taken from the Spaniards, of an unusual Big∣ness, as a Trophy for the Peoples Insultation. Both these Ships, all things being taken out of them that were fit for use, were left to the Submersion of the Ocean. And now the Hollanders and Frizelanders were informed, that the whole Fleet of the Enemy was passing along by their Coasts, where∣upon they fearing, that they intended to get into the Mouth of the Eemes, hasted to take away all Land-Marks, by the sight whereof, Men sailing at Sea, avoided the Shallows of those Places. The Spanish Commanders, thus worsted in so many En∣counters, and all throwing the blame from themselves, upon the Duke of Parma, began to consult about their Departure; although they plainly saw, that the danger thereof must be overcome with many other Hazards: For back again, all the Narrow Seas were beset; so that there remained but one help, which was to compass all the Northern Parts of Bri∣tain,
where the Rugged Ocean, not broken by the Land, is not onely boysterous, but very seldom passed without the danger of Shipwrack. And if they had then been hindred, so great a Fear, both of the Sea, and their Enemies, had seized upon them, that it was reported, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia be∣gan to advise, whether he should yield up the Fleet, and make Propositions for saving their Lives. But the English, onely watching what course they took, least they should fall upon Scotland, or enter the Danish Seas, as soon as they perceived them leave all that Coast, would not, by following them, ran into the same danger with them, since they onely sought a way for their flight through that great Ocean, resting very well content with the Honour of driving away the Fleet, and saving their Country. For when they would eagerly have pur∣sued them, they were (as I told you before) hindred, for want of Gun-powder. But they sent the Lord Seymor back in good time, that he, joyning with the Hollanders Fleet, should repel all the Duke of Parma's Endeavours; the rest, having for a while been tossed with a Tempest, at length got safe into England, though not without danger. The Glory of the Greeks and Romans, who, of Old, made good all their greatest Affairs by Navall Victories, was, with∣out doubt, at this time, equalled by the Fortune and Valour of the English, though the Conquest was slowly and safely gotten, without the joyning in a close and intermingled Battel. And, in the event of this Contest, it is very remark∣able, that in all the time they fought with the Spaniards, there was not one considerable Ship lost, nor above one hun∣dred killed or destroyed, either by the Sea, or the War; when all this while, the Spaniards underwent all kinds of miseries; for having lost near five Thousand Men, and their best Ships, many of those that remained, being either sick or wounded, and wanting all things, they were at length glad to throw themselves, for safety, into the merciless Fury of a most impetuous and stormy Sea, where they threw over∣board
their Horses, Cattel, and much other Goods, to lighten their Ships against the insulting Waves. Then the Duke of Medina Sidonia gave Order to such as came up to him, that they should steer their Course between the Orcades, and some other Islands in that Sea, to the Ports of Biscay. Himself with some few Ships that were in better case than the rest, makes his way to the Great Sea, the rest went not far off from Ireland; some of whom, by various stress of Weather, brought back again, were cast, some upon the Coast of Eng∣land, some of France: Many driven into Norway, were then dashed in pieces against the Rocks; and another part there∣of, by a boysterous and raging Storm, was whiled into the furthest part of the North, and the yet unknown World. The King of Scotland performed the Laws of Peace and Hospita∣lity to all that were cast upon his Dominions; Two and Thirty were cast away upon the Irish Flatts, and the adja∣cent Sea, and the men labouring to save themselves, we slain by the Inhabitants, because they were more in number, than consisted with their safety to shew mercy to; the rest were followed even into their Country, by the implacable. Fury of Revengeful Fate, where two of them were burnt i the very Port or Harbour; and others, by like Mischances, destroyed; onely Thirty remained, that carryed Provisions, and of Ships of War, out one of all that late so great Fleer, bringing home the Commander in Chief. Many of the No∣bles, and not a few of the common sort, died soon after their Return, either by the Diseases they contracted in so trouble∣some and unfortunate a Voyage, or else out of grief of Mind, that while they looked upon themselves as Conquerours, they should be subdued by the peevishness of Fortune. The great∣ness of their Loss appeared in this, that the King was forced to shorten the time of Mourning by Edict, that he might hide from the publick view the Misfortune thereof, that had filled so many Noble Families, with Funerall Obse∣quies.
Some of the Prisoners, both in England and Holland, were Ransomed; others had their Liberty given them freely. Ma∣ny times men learn Piety from Fear, and the Event of a Thing hanging in doubtful suspence, makes them run to their Prayers: But here Publick Thanksgivings were Ordered to be given to God for this Victory: and the Queen her Self, being carryed in Triumph, according to the antient manner, made a Speech to the People; wherein she shewed, That a greater benefit could never be received from the Divine and Eter∣nal Providence of God, whereby to make out, how weak and vain all Humane Strength is, against the Power of Heaven. And the Hollanders reaped another Benefit from this common Dan∣ger, because, after this, they had the more Friendly Society of the English, who hitherto were wont to boast, that they had supported those Allies onely out of meer Humanity. But the Duke of Parma, while the Remainders of the Shipwrackt Fleet were getting home to Spain, being cast from his accustomed Felicity, into a Gulph of Misery, and thrown from the heighth of Confidence, to the bottom of Despair, rather by the impulse of others, than his own Ad∣vice, because he began to be hated, is drawn to besiege Ber∣op. Zome; The Brabanters urged him, That he should not suffer one Town, whence daily Inroads were made by their Troops of Horse into their Country, and laid wast their Fields, to infest them, and put a stop to all his Victories. Although he was not well pleased to remove the Army, now burthensom to ex∣hausted Flanders, to any other place, least out of Shame or Fear, if it should refuse, it should seem there was no rely∣ing upon their Assistance: But if Fortune would once more become favourable, and the Design should succeed, thereby a way would be made into the Isles of Zeland, and so to carry the War into Holland, the next way, as he thought, to revive those hope, which he had too confidently before relyed on, and lost. For that Town being rarely scituated on the Bor∣ders of Brabant, at a little distance overlooks Zeland; not
far thence is the River Schelde, into which the Zome (from whence the Town is so named) falleth, whereby the Town hath a long, but somewhat inversed, or winding, Haven. It was in a very flourishing condition, by continual Commerce, under the Command of a Noble Family, bearing its Surname, untill by the Neighborhood of Antwerp, and the Mischiefs of War, it decayed; having been taught woful Experience, both by the Enemy, and those who remained there in Garri∣son. But when it came to be annexed to the Ʋnited States, though sometimes indanger'd by Treachery, yet now was  first et upon by Force and a Siege. Thol, an Isle and Town of Zeland, is divided from the Territory of Berghen, by an Arm or Branch of the Scheld; which being convenient, for the passage of the Forces, least, if it should be left to the Hollanders, it might hinder the Siege, Montigy and Octa∣vius, of Kindred to the Count Mansfeldt, were sent before to possess it; who, coming upon a suddain, together with fly∣ing Reports given out, as if the War were intended against Hosden, they lead Eight Hundred Souldiers over the Fords, hoping to have privily surprized the Coast or Border of Ze∣land; but the time of the Waters slowing being not well ob∣served, (for then it flowed) a few men easily worsted all those Defendants, endeavouring with staggering Foot-steps, by reason of the Mud, to go forward: In the mean time, the Msketiers they had left in Brabant, deended themselves under the Defence and Shield of the Bank (for so the place proved to them) But presently, by the care of George Ebrard, Count Solmes, that was Governour of the Island, and the noi∣sing abroad of the danger, the multitude of his men increa∣sing put the Enemy to flight, and drove them into the Whirl∣pools, where, without possibility of help, they perished; the Captains themselves hardly escaped by swimming. The natural Marishness of the place, being very Watry, and some∣what deep, destroyed, as some report, Four Hundred Men; and if any part of their Bodies, being yet alive, appeared
above Water, presently with Darts, or other Things cast at them, they were killed; in all this Encounter, there being of the adverse Side but one man kill'd, which is almost miracu∣lous to relate; and from thenceforth the Island was strength∣ned with Castles, Guards, and other Military Engines of De∣fence. Hereupon, the Duke of Parma taking another Reso∣lution, that by shutting up their Haven, he might straighten the Townsmen of Provision, with his great Army he besieg∣ed their Works, placing Guards in all places near about them; and where his Men were by any means separated, he made Bridges, to unite the passages to each other. With all which, the Citizens of Berghen were nothing terrified, nor were as if they had been besieged, because both Souldiers and Aid, with all other things necessary for Defence, were plentifully brought to them out of Zeland, and the Neigh∣bouring Cities of Holland, they fought either with Horse or Foot, as if it had been two Camps one against another, many light Skirmishes, but never without drawing bloud from the Enemy: Nor was the Souldiers Valour onely exemplary, but the Townsmens Labour, spent in fortifying the place, was notable; but most laudable of all, was the Concord between the Captains and the Magistrates, whereby they raised Mo∣ney without grumbling by extraordinary Taxes. But a differ∣ence beginning among the English Commanders (who had a great strength in that Garrison) and every thing else, be∣sides that of Trouble, was publikely setled by Prince Mau∣rice, and the Deputies of the States, brought thither by a strong and safe Convoy. Between the Town and the River Scheld were two Castles; on the one side sufficiently defended by Bulwarks; on the other, by the Estuary of the Sea; and for the Battery on that of the North side, the Duke of Parma did, though in vain, endeavour by his great Guns to divide it from the Town, to hinder all passage and Trade by Sea; and he was induced to that Care and Charge by the hope of Treachery, which the Italian Policy is often eluded by: Two
Spanish Captives sollicited a Cook or Victualler, at whose house they were kept, and an English Souldier that used to frequent the house, (his name was Grimston) to betray the Castle; which passage, because it is worthy to be known, I will relate. They, although they could well enough in their own Natures digest any kind of Lucre, yet so they resolved, that if they could get any thing, they would rather cozen their Enemies than their Friends; and with this conclusion, they come to the Governour, tell him of the Design, and de∣sire his Instructions, which he gives them in this manner, That both of them should take opportunity to go to the Duke of Parma, that he might not flight their Endeavours; or rather, which hapned, that he might under the Vizor of Observance be cir∣cumvented. The Duke binds them to him by Oath, and for their present Fortune, loads them both with Gifts and Promises; and when yet he durst hardly trust them, unless themselves in the Plot incurred some personal danger, it was agreed, that they should be bound between two Armed Souldiers, with naked Daggers in their Hands, that should go to the Fort, but kill them before, if they perceived any Intention of De∣ceit. Thus imagining there had been caution enough used, and that having slighted their own, they would not decline the Aid and Protection of Strangers: Upon this Confidence therefore Three Thousand Men, and among them many of great quality, were drawn out to undertake the seizing of the Castle; The Gate was open, till fifty were entred, and thus far the Event made good their Promises: But then presently a Port-Cullis, the Ropes that held it being cut, was let down, and all that were come in, were kill'd or taken; nor did the Spanish Keepers mind the killing of the two bound Traytors, being amazed with suddain fear, and dreading the Fury of present Revenge. But the excluded Multitude, seeing they could not make any way back, though they pressed and thronged with all their might, turning Despair into Valour,
they scaled the Bulwark, running through the Trench which was now empty, by reason of the Ebbe, and were now past the first Palisadoes, through the Breast-work within, whence driven with Fire-Balls, Hand-Granadoes, and their Fire∣works, prepared by those within, fore-warned of the Design, and flying whither they could, fell into Ambuscadoes, and other Traps laid for them, and so were destroy'd; a great part of them were slain, and they that escaped slaughter, the Tide now coming in, and by their ignorance of the place were smother'd in the Mud: The Duke of Parma finding himself thus deceived, and that the Cruelty of the Weather wore out his men by Diseases and Death, when now, in the latter part of Autumn, the Plains were, by frequent Rains, turned into Pools, and the Rampires ready to fall, by reason of the Mire, first he left his Works, then deserted his Camp, and a long time afflicted with the scarcity of many things, but at last with the want of all, but especially of fresh Water, he was forced, by little and little, to break up his Siege, which he had for six Weeks vainly continued: but least it should seem that he had done nothing, he left some few places forti∣fyed against Excursions. But the Townsmen of Berghen, nothing hindred thereby, after that very much inriched them∣selves, by frequent Booties taken from the Enemy, and began again to re-flourish, being under the peculiar Obedience of Prince Maurico; for the States gave him this, and other places, which had follow'd the Enemies part, in lieu of those paternal Inheritances of his own, which the Spaniard held from him. The Duke of Parma all this Winter, quarter'd his men in the Village of Brabant, by means whereof that Country was wasted, though not so soon as Flanders. At the beginning of the Spring, the Lord of Cimace (the Duke Areschots Son) was sent by the Prince of Parma, with a Selected Band of Souldiers, to besiege Bonne, where Schenck not having men enough to defend it, but sending to the Prin∣ces of Germany for Aid, laying before them the danger of
that famous City, when they returned neither to himself, not to Truxius, any Forces to resist the Enemy, it being their In∣terest, that under the pretence of War in the Netherlands, the Spanish Power should not invade all that was near them, and by that means, by little and little, incroach upon their Right; for powerful Empires are wont to take first one thing, then another, till at length they seize the whole; their being now no Remedy to help themselves, but by sending him present Supplies, and out of the common fear to asso∣ciate and joyn their Powers; concluding thus, That if they would defend and protect him, he would preserve and keep Bonne for them: But this Rhetorical Demand; was answer'd with a Souldier-like Resolution, in the Name of the Germans,  such Tearms as he little expected. [But We, say they shal not embroyl our selves in other mens Quarrels for your sake, ha∣ving been better instructed by the many improspering Aids so often into France: The Differences of the Provinces are ambi∣guous among themselves, but would prove certainly very dan∣gerous to any Forreigners that should interlope. Some of our Number have never medled with the Netherlands, the benefit whereof they are well satisfied in, not willing to be rewarded as the King of France was, for sending his Brother thither; and Katharine of Medices, for aiding Antonio. And now, when the same Spaniards seek Amity and a League, shall we go to incense Philip? who himself being a part of us, by his great Pos∣sessions in Germany, restored to their Seats the German Bi∣shops: Nay, rather it behoves us to submit to his Potency, with the desire of Peace, than exasperate his Fury to the Triall of a Warre.] Thus being frustrate of his hope, while both the English and Hollanders being otherwise taken up, denyed relief to greater necessities, as well as to him: he exhorts the Souldi∣ers left in the Garrison, to keep off the Enemy, which they might with safety, and valiantly to endure the Siege; which accordingly they did, and killing Baptista Taxis, an eminent
Spanish Commander, and comming off Victors in many Sal∣lies, after the Enemy with six moneths toyl and hazard, had in a manner beaten down all the Fortifications, and the be∣sieged suffered great hunger, he delivered the City upon ho∣nourable Conditions, into the Power of the Bishop, a Bava∣rian, for that name was used, though Spanish Souldiers entred into, and held the City. Hence Count Mansfeldt is com∣manded, who in the beginning of Autumn, had carryed a Recruit to the Lord Cimace's Forces, the Siege being now ended, to attaque with part of the same Wacttendonc, a Town that lies in the upper part of Gelderland, near the little River Nersa; The Garrison consisted of some Companies of Shenckes men, and the scituation of the place being very marshy, and the depth of Winter made the coming to an assault very difficult. But the ground being raised by the Be∣siegers, unto the heighth of a little Hill, from whence they should look down upon the Houses, and the Bullets shot from that place at some times, and at other times fire cast thence into the Town, so infested the Townsmen, whom another fear had likewise possessed, least the coming of a great Frost should make all those moyst and wet places, by Ice, passea∣ble for the Enemy, that they perswaded the Souldiers not to stand out, hopeless of any second Relief, (because the For∣ces of their Allyes were small, and a great way off) and ha∣zard all their lives and fortunes. However, the Town was defended till the very end of the year, the continuing of the Siege till which time, what with the extremity of the wea∣ther, and what with want of necessaries, cost many thousand of the Besiegers lives, though at last they compassed their in∣tentions, by the getting of the Town. At this time, by reason of the great expense, charge, da∣mage, and losse of the Spanish Fleet, which had wonderfully exhausted the Kings Treasure, the Army had been a long time without any pay, by reason whereof, there were fre∣quent Seditions; and the hopes of great plunder allured
many to revolt to the Enemy, so that the Hollanders, safe with∣in their Rivers, a little enlarging their bounds, did without danger or detriment, make incursions into the Enemies Country. But the States of these parts, while they shunned new, fell into their old, pressures: for some who had been in Arms under the Arch-Duke Matthias, and the Duke of Anjon, Francis de Valois, and boldly usurping the name of Princes strangers, by publick Authority, seized all the Dutch Ships that were in or about Scotland: But an Embasse being sent to the Princes, informed them of their error, as  understanding the Customs of Holland; for the Hollanders though they assisted divers Cities with their Forces, yet they never made themselves lyable to any debts by them contract∣ed, for they were only subject to the Authority of the Prince of Aurange. Neither did they now rightly demand from the confederate States, what those Provinces did owe, which had receded from the League. This I thought fit to insert, because by such Speeches,  did refell those prejudicial exactions, and occasion there was given, of covenanting with the Commanders that re∣mained, with an Oath, concerning their old debts to be paid by certain portions, to the great ease of the Commonwealth. Among these things, partly by a common fear, and partly by the Prisoners of Utrecht, who thought to remedy their folly by pertinacy, the differences begun by the Earl of Leicester burst out fresh.1589. But the Carrison Souldiers of Gertruydenburg, consisting of one thousand five hundred Foot, and three hundred Horse, because they had u∣surped a greater Licence from the occasion of the discords, than they supposed could be pardoned, and fearing an Infamy among their fellow Souldiers, would not be reduced to order, but remained arrogant by the Neighbour-hood of the Enemy. At the beginning of their Sedition, though they turned out their present Officers, and elected whom they pleased, yet they would not hearken either to the Duke of Parma's Let∣ters
or Messengers: Afterwards some Agents for the Enemy, being mingled amongst them, their ignorance not minding them, and those Agents sent to the Hollanders to treat with them, upon their return, setting forth the threats they had heard, to the worst, with the fear of punishment, they not only became enemies themselves, but provoked others to be so; so that contempt made them outragious, after Willoughby, the Colonel of the English Auxiliarias, under pretence of appeasing the Souldiery, had in truth made his Kinsman Wingfield the head of the Sedition, according to the Advice of the Town, and bestowed the pay sent by the States so as he might oblige, or make sure, such as were suspected, not by any certain Rule, but as he hoped to have them upon occasion, whereupon the Souldiers mocked at them, as being deceived by them, and abused what they had, as if it had been booty. And as soon as the Captains, and the Souldiers, by their ex∣ample, had spent this money in riot and excess, they sent forth parties of Horse every way, to plunder and bring in booty from the Country. Nay, they retained all Ships that came within their reach, without any distinction of friend or foe; nor did they spare the Provinces that were absolutely at peace. Thus passing the Winter, they were solicited to treache-which would procure an easie Pardon for all their crimes, by Odourdo Lanzavecchia, the Governour of Breda: for (as he said true,) the manner of their offending was dangerous, and that might be urged for an excuse to the Duke of Parma, which neither the English, or Hollander, would ever admit of. This Counsel, they, being now ready to receive any impres∣sion of evill, hearkened to, and according to the Custom of Sedition, were inraged with all that perswaded otherwise: And forthwith all of them, as it were possessed with a sudden Frenzy, seize all the Townsmens Arms, some few in that mad multitude not daring to speak for fear. The name of Englishmen is pre ended for all this uproar, as well by the
Captain, and most others of that Nation, as by the D Souldiers themselves. And the more insolent they grow,  more is impunity offered to them by Letters from the States, who began to fear the worst, desiring them to return to their Colours, forgetting all those discords which publike erro and the malice of fate had thrown amongst them, and that they would do an acceptable piece of Service to the Common∣wealth, if they would put an end to those disturbances, al∣though they did not begin them. But their Consciences acc∣sing them of all their evill deeds, made them afraid to give credit to this Invitation. Hereupon, it was put to the questi∣on on, if an Army should be prepared against these Rebels, who so arrogantly slighted the Commands and Authority both of the States, and of Prince Maurice. Some would not have the Souldier to be further incensed with danger, alleadging, time and opportunity would better cure such distempers, whose violence cannot long continue. On the other side, it was affirmed, that they made a mock∣ery at patience and lenity, and should they stay till the ene∣my, with whom even then they privately treated, was admit∣ted openly into the Town? if Pardon were offered to them, with terrour attending it, as it would encourage the good, so would it compel the rest to repent: Thus of late, Medeleks was restored by the penitence of the Souldiery, after the E∣nemy had long hoped for it, with a fruitless expectation; It matters not, said others, which course is taken to save the place, for men resolved to be treacherous, would still con∣tinue in the same mind, whether you leave them to them∣selves, or seek to win them by perswasions. Wherefore, it the beginning of the Spring, Prince Maurice gathered toge∣ther, as many Forces as he could, both by Sea and Land, though not sufficient for a Siege, and with them marches thi∣therward: At the first approach, a battery was made against the Town with Cannon, which was answered with the like by the Rebels, little being then done, but that among the rest,
Justus Villiers was killed, who was a great Souldier, for∣merly Governour of Ʋtrecht, and now Camp-master, and the Person that had instructed the Princes youth in Military Dis∣cipline, and all Warlike Affairs. And when they perceived the Prince intended to storm the place forthwith, having now beaten down the Bulwark, and laid open the Town, they di∣verted that eminent danger, and turned it aside under the cloak of a Treaty, and the day following, what with the over∣flowing of the Rivers, and what with the Rayn, the intended agreement was never perfected: Besides, there was news, that Lanzavecchia, with a select number of Souldiers, was approaching at the instigation of Wingfield; nor did that Englishman want words to perswade the accomplishment of the Treason. But calling the people together, speaks to them to this effect, [Yon see them here (saith he) whose Bul∣lets and fire never were thrown with like fury against the Walls of an Enemy, and therefore have been so much more dangerous to as, and now they threaten as presently with the Sword, and we all as enemies, by their unanimous consent, are designed either to slaughter or punishment, But yonder are they who come to preserve us, from whom we many merit both favour and reward: It is no is your hand fellow Souldiers, whether to run the hazard of yielding to the one, or to give and receive a benefit from the others.] This Oration was applauded generally, they who were near with their words, and the rest with a kind of soft and whispering noyse, signifying their consent. Prince Maurice being not prepared for a long Siege, re∣solved to depart, and the rather, because he would not seem to necessitate that treacherous yielding of the Town to the Enemy, which he could not prevent or hinder. But yet he sent Letters to them, to try if either respect of honesty, or fear of Infamy, could yet prevail on any of them.
But that mercinary People received them with scorn, es∣pecially for that the Duke of Parma, had, besides payment of their so long elapsed Wages, bestowed among them also a Donative. It is reported, that then he began to clear up his countenance, which had been long clouded with grief, wh from a high Tower in the taken City, he could see Dort, and those other places of his hope, at the beginning of the Wa It pleased him to look upon, and Command the first of all the Holland Cities, after 12. years reduced into his power. And such was the over-hastiness of his exaltation, that the being yet none of his Souldiers entred the Town, he trusted his person to them, whom of all other, being admitted;  ought for that very cause, to have suspected, and some w in very great fear, lest taking hold of so great an opportuni∣ty, they should again have proved treacherous to him: Be there was no time to mention such a thing, and therefore  have been dangerous to be spoken of; They delivered the Town to him, not to his party, least they should deceive both. Few of the men either returned to England, or their old obedience, though some did; but the rest, according to their number, as the Duke of Parma had seperated them; did very great service in the Warres, never assuming to them∣selves any but in Victory; for being prescribed as Traytors, and Renegadoes, they had forfeited all their priviledges of Souldiers by their crimes. Nay, their villany was condemn∣ed by those who reped the benefit of their Treason, by whom they were long after yeered with the name of Mer∣chants, scarce any of them coming to a naturall and timely death; and if so, yet not without Infamy. Many were af∣terwards taken in other Cities, and according to Martial Law executed. The Souldiery to whom the Duke of Parma delivered the possession of the City, made many valiant excursions, and severall times in a short space fought very fortunately, sur∣prizing three Troops of Prince Maurices Horse, as they were
negligently scattered up and down near Boisledue. From hence it appeared very necessary to take in all the adjacent places, and accordingly, the care thereof was committed to the in∣feriour Commanders. Besides Gertruydenburg, there are two other Towns belonging to the jurisdiction of Holland, and lye now beyond the Maes. But Hesdin, formerly was con∣tained in the Maes before the waters were conveighed away by a new Channel, reputed a part of the antient County of Teisterbant, under the Allegiance and Patronage of the Prin∣ces of Clve, who afterwards transferred their might to the Hollander. But the Town of Settenberg, of old part of Stri∣deland, it is seperated by a River, and therefore, as to the matters of Religion, it is under the care of the Bishop of Leige, nor of the Bishop of Ʋtrecht, as the rest of Holland is; It had proper Princes of its own, yet so, as they were to do homage to the Princes of Holland, and severall Villages above Gertruydenburgh have very antiently been subject to them; is having been the Custom of valiant Nations, when they conquer, to passe the next River, and make the further Banks thereof the bounds of their Empire; notwithstanding all which, the Brbanters have a long time, but to no purpose, challenged both Gertruydenburgh and Hesdin, to belong to them: But now Count Aremberg with ease prevailed over Settenberg, being very meanly fortifyed, and so the more rea∣dy to be spoyled by any Armies; but he could not keep it, because the Hollanders were in possession of Nordam, and the other adjacent places. Charles Mansfelt being sent against Hesdin, attempted also Bommel, the head of the adjoyning Isle, and encompassed with double branches of the Maes and Wael, there meeting, by the guilt and treacheries of some of the Townsmen: But the Treason being discovered and punished, he straightly be∣sieged it as he had begun, resolutely keeping his first design∣ed Station near to Hemerte Castle, though the River breaking over his bounds, had, by its excessive increase, over-flowed all
the Fields: And now Hesdin whs not so much afraid of Fo as Famine, it being defended against the Enemy, who had encompassed it about at a great distance by Famarsh, who was a man of undanted Resolution, and would not doubt to undergo the greatest Extremities: But Prince Maia prevented it, who gathering a sufficient Number of Men from the next Garrisons, brake through where the Enemy was thinnest, bringing in all things, whose want was feared. These things thus done; Mansfeldt with Ships, Guns, and other Warlike Engines, set upon, having carryed thither some part of his Army, the Castle Holow, in the Isle of Bommel. In this place there was Endeavour, strength, and sufficiency of Defence; but Sidenborg, by a too hasty yielding, took away all occasions both of Hope and Fear; He seemed to lay  fault thereof upon the Souldiers, and that with the great Confidence, because many of them had been kill'd; the Spa∣niard, as they marched out, cruelly butchering them, without the Knowledg or Consent of their Captains, with the Gar∣rison of this place, and of Creveceur over against it; which being destroy'd by Count Hohenlo, the King's Officers had re-builded, entring the Island at the meeting of the River Maes, and a little Rivulet call'd Dise; they wasted the open Fields, and all other indefensible places, both of Forts and Castles, not well knowing which way they should evade; the Rivers being swell'd with Showers; tearing down the Fortifications begun, at the very ending of the Island, over against Gorrichou. Afterwards, by other Directions, invading divers places beyond the Wael; now they come to Gelder∣land, anon they trouble Ʋtrecht, and last of all the Island Vorne, not far from Bommel; and two years before strength∣ned by the Nassauians with a Castle, where hearing this Count Hohenlo, with a selected Party of Horse and Fod drew nigh, with an intent to fight them, Mansfeldt afraid of the Report, in regard there was no possibility of his stays after he had consumed the Spring and the Summer in vain;
at the best, but Trivial Matters; wherefore re-passing the Maes, by the suddain madness and fury of a Spanish Regi∣ment, for want of their Pay, which he endeavour'd to appease, was like to have been slain. Saurius Laeva was their Col∣lonel, and beloved as well by the Souldiers as by Mansfeldt himself, though they had lately had some difference in words: Nay, there were some that did believe the Prince of Ascu∣lus, and Duke of Pastrana, had under-hand, in hatred to the Duke of Parma, encouraged the Sedition. Without doubt, the Parmian Prince, excelling all the Spanish Commanders in Glory, and the Greatness of his Atchievments, had contract∣ed upon himself great Envy; and the rather, because he openly shew'd a greater Respect to, and put a stronger Con∣fidence in the Italians; from whence it came to pass, that some would no less find fault with his Vertues, than Mis∣carriages which were but accidental; openly affirming, that he betray'd the Spanish Fleet; that all his Endeavours against the Netherlanders were nothing worth; and many other such like Things. But his Conquering so many of the Provinces, being the greatest part of the Netherlands, and the unwearied and stre∣nuous Labour taken by that People against him, were clan∣destinely represented to the King, as much as might be, to his disadvantage, though under the shew of praise and admira∣tion: Nor had their fear of him been vain, if his Life had been prolong'd, to the detriment of the Spanish Empire, least being famous for War, and his Clemency in Governing, for which even his Enemies loved him, he should (as many then Reported) alter and change his present Possession for Portu∣gall, belonging of Right to his Son. Certainly, either Philip, as it is the Nature of Kings, being apt to be timorous and suspectful, himself frustrated his Fortune, while he over-char∣ged him with Honour, or else necessitated by reall Poverty, did restrain his excessive Charges: However it was, the Prince of Parma, on the one side, by Care to provide against
all those Evils that Penury uses to bring forth, and on the other, over-toiled with the Weight of present Affairs, fell sick, which caused him to go into Germany, to the Span Wa∣ters: And after this time, he was never perfectly in Health, nor was fortunate in his Undertakings, as before. For which cause the Italians, a Nation infinitely jealous, and taking for Truth, whatever they imagine, reported that the Spaniards had poyson'd the Duke; and the Bruic thereof, seeming to be made out by their other Cruelties prevailed; but chiefly, because every one is willing to believe any Evil of a Spa∣niard: But this was not without some shew of Reason;  Prince Maurice having intercepted divers Letters, among the rest had those, wherein Parma was grievously accused  King Philip, which the Prince sent to him. But he, as it were, not minding this Kindness of his Enemy, nor returning  Thanks, invited the Inditer of those Letters, one John M to a Feast, which he did not long over-live, which gave new matter for Discourse. (This More was he, that with great Cunning, Policy, and many Largesses and Bribes, had pro∣moted the Spanish Affairs in France) and this manner of Talk was the more frequent, because he, who was believed the Minister of Revenge, had not any Reward, but rather was cast out of Favour. Upon this occasion, the Duke sent ∣chardot into Spain, to clear him of those Aspersions cast upon him, because he did not aid the Spanish Fleet; The King publikely heard him, and the Duke of Medina-Sidonia that was likewise accused, and seemed to pardon both the Dukes. The Tumult of the Souldiers, a little before mention'd, being appeased, with the punishment of a few, and the Re∣giment disbanded, though it had been long in the War, M∣feldt was commanded, with seventy compleat Ensigns, to directly thence to take Berck on a suddain. That City belong∣ing to the Bishop of Colen, had now been strongly fortifies three years, from the time the Duke of Parma depart
thence: Truxius and Nienarius, having lately gotten it, That having referred his cause, This his Quarrell, to the Ʋni∣ted States, had deliver'd the disputed Possession thereof to them, as indifferent Judges and Moderators between them. But at the beginning of this Year, the Hollanders being stron∣ger than they in Horse, made a Bridge over the Rhine, and furnish'd it with Souldiers and Provisions: For this cause, at the Request of the Bishop (who came in person to the Duke of Parma) Varembonius, the Governour of Gelderland for the King, was sent with part of the Army, to see if he could reduce it, either by force of starving. In their Journey thi∣ther, he fell upon, but not without loss, the Castle of Blybeke, (this place Collonel Schenck, not minding propriety, chal∣lenged to himself, as his own by Conquest) for the Garrison, consisting of old and well-disciplin'd Souldiers, a whole Moneth endured the Thunder of their Cannon and other Guns, valiantly returning them the like, had made a more than equal Slaughter, untill a greater loss hapning upon some few, and by the Death of their Captains, being at variance, (after they had turned out the rest) and their Ammunition beginning to fail, they let the Enmy have the place. One Remarkable Thing was observed in this Victory, to wit, a Woman found among the dead Bodies, that had, in Man's Habit, and with a Masculine Courage, followed the Warre: The like to this was frequently observed at the beginning of the Troubles; nor did any Age formerly produce so many such Examples: For as the Minds of People were stirred up to the War, by the frequent naming of God, the Country, and the Prince, so even the distinction of the Sexes was laid aside, that the practice of Hatred and Revenge, might with more freedom be made use of: But Schenck's Nature always inclined to Cruelty, wth the Conjunction of his Loss and Shame together, was now more inraged: This place, taking away his Goods, he set on fire; but chafed without measure because he had not Souldiers enough to relieve the Besieged
in Berck, however drawing together all both Horse and Foot that he could make, he fortified a place upon the Bank of the Rhine, not far from the Town call'd Reux, in spight of all Varembonius his Endeavours to the contrary, from whence he conveyed into the Town of Berck all the Forces he had received. Afterwards, receiving Intelligence, that Ver∣dugo was coming with more Forces, by speedy Matches be came upon them at unawares, at the River Lup, in the Fields of Westfalia, with a furious slaughter; so that they fled, and left to him the Money that they were carrying into Frize∣land to pay the Souldiers. Not content herewith, but grows more confident by his Success, he threatned to storm and sack Nieumegen by Night, (for he bore a spleen to the Town;) and, to that purpose, in a Dark chosen for that end, sending his Cavallery before, and some few Ferry-Boats, which the Souldiers carryed, and passing the Wael, he came to that part of the City, which was onely strong by the Rivers Curr that way: commanding his nimblest men to break down the Fences of one of the Houses that stood backward upon the Bank, that entring there, they might disperse themselves through the City in Troops, and so set upon and win the Gates: But by chance, in the House where this Stratag was executed, (for it was not the same House which Schenck had before marked, the mistake being easily made by the darkness of the Night) there was a Wedding; so that im∣mediatly a great Outery being made there, the Townsmen were Allarm'd, and beset the House, driving back such as came out thence with Arms, and shooting at them with Guns: The Multitude got new Courage with the approach of Day; but Schenck's Men being few, in the narrow passa∣ges were shut, and not knowing which way to go for fear, cruelly slain: Their Collonel himself standing upon the Bank, was not able to withstand their flight; sometimes en∣couraging all; another time, some particular persons by Name, That they would go through with their Noble Underta∣kings,
and by a valiant Assault, open the way for others to follow them. But all would not make them stop their flight: And to perfect their Ruine, there hapned another fatal Mischance to them; for the Boats which they had brought with them from their Garrison, were by the force of the stream of the Water, carryed before it was Day below the City, so that such as fled Could not come at them. This over-born with the strength and Weapons of their Enemies, and the few Boats that were left, not able to con∣tain all with the Weight and Tumult of those that crowded into them, sunk, and many of them were drowned in the Ri∣ver, among whom their Collonel, heavily laden with Arms, was one. This was the end of Collonel Schencke, a man, exceeding most of his time in noble and generous Courage; his Family and Descent was not mean, but yet the Glory of it was much inlarged under the Prince of Parma. Afterwards the Earl of Leicester made him a Knight, and bestow'd on him many other Military Honours; for Wisdom and Va∣lour he merited high esteem, but yet would subject himself neither to Laws nor Customs; for which, the Souldiers of For∣tune honoured him, but the Magistrates and Common People hated his Name; his Disposition, though it had been fierce and untractble in his Youth, yet now, in his latter time, it began to grow more mild and flexible: His Body, when found by the Victors, because he had left them, and gone over to the States, was exposed to publike shame and laughter. But the Revenge of the Souldiery, forced them to alter the Scene, for they severely punished all Captives that came to their hands, belonging to Nieumegen: Yet for all that two years it lay unburied, untill by the taking of the Town by Prince Maurice, it had a decent Interment. Nienarius also, about the same time, was kill'd by chance, while he was care∣lesly viewing some Instruments or Engines of War: A Man certainly, of an unblameable Conversation, though at last coming into the War. Truxius thus deprived of both his
Chief Commanders, by whose Valour and Conduct, the good Fortune of his Party had hitherto been upheld, at length left off the War, but especially because the Enemy had won Berck, where a long Siege, spun out until the following year, with the loss of much Bloud, at last got the Victory for the Spaniards: But Schemk's Souldiers, though they had re∣ceived heir Arrears, and were entertained into Pay anew among the rest, yet mad with grief for the loss of their Col∣lonel, in earned a Sedition; because that Island being in their hands, would easily procure them a Chapman within the Bounds of the Rhine. Nothwithstanding this, the Hollanders took great Care afterwards to relieve Berck, though with no other hope, than to make the Enemy lose time, since they could not hinder his taking the City: Count Falcosteine be∣ing sent with Two Thousand Men, besides some choice Horse, according to this Advice, was follow'd by Varen∣nius, as soon as in his Journey, having taken the Castle be∣fore-mention'd, he had passed the River, yet with no intent to fight, though he were much the stronger, but onely design∣ing to fall upon their Rear as they marched; and finding  Opportunity for the same, was at the first received by  Francis Vere, commanding then two English Companies new∣ly raised, with which he sustained the Brunt and Heat of the Charge, until the Horse came in, and shortly after all the Foot Colours. Here was a great slaughter, considering the Number of Combatants; and the choicest the best men of the Enemies being slain, there were taken a great number of Horse, with one Cornet, and Ten Foot Colours: Some few fled, and escaped with their Captain. Vere having given this famous Testimony of his Valour and Judgment, was shortly after prefer'd to the highest Dignitie, to his great Renown. Varembunius laid the blame upon Charles Mansfield, (for he was present also) for the greatest part of this loss, though he had brought to him, at the time of this Fight, some Com∣panies
out of the Isle of Bommell; because lately, both of them suing for the same Command, wherein Charles being denyed and the other preferred, it was said, he now deserted him, a emulous of his Glory. But by this means, the Conquerour-afterwards brought in safely to the Besieged all their Car∣riages, both with Provision and Men; they also having near the same time made a lucky Sally into the next Quarter of the Enemies Leaguer; and this done, returning through by∣ways, they escaped any danger intended to them by the Enemy. And now the Besieged were in so good condition, that they slighted the Enemies Forces, though of late much recruited, until the Spaniard had by force taken a Castle near to Rees, that was their onely hopes of Succour, and supply of Provisions: Three Months after this, in the next year, the Winter continued, when the Hollanders, considering seriously with themselves, that they had not Forces enough to relieve a place so far distant from them, as occasion would require, came at length to this last Result; That the Town should be surrendred upon Honourable Conditions: And thus the Duke of Parma obtained Berck, and not so contented, he clandestine∣ly sought to get Bonne and Nuisse, Cities belonging to the Dutchy of Cleves; and this he did with the more Confidence, in regard of the Prince's Age and Infirmity, having also won many of the Nobles to be his Pensioners. Thus he got Pos∣session of Arnhem, not far from the Rhine; Not was Aquis∣grave, a free City of the German Empire, let alone at peace, among so many broils; for Philip claiming the Custody of that City, as antiently belonging to the Princes of Brabant, (for he endeavour'd to hide his Ambition of being Lord, under the Title of Guardian thereof) by his Edict banish'd many of the Inhabitants, who had forsaken the Roman Reli∣gion: But their stay being bought off, with a Sum of Money given to the King's Commanders, content onely to have wa∣sted and forrag'd the Fields, left the City, until many years
after, the Fury of several Parties falling upon, Germany, this City, among the rest, was seized, under the pretence of Right. While the Armies thus range about the Maes and the Rhine, and meeting Parties skirmish and fight every where, the Mauricians got exceeding much Booty: for the Hope wasted all the Enemies Country with Fire and Sword, car∣rying away all manner of Provisions, having either kill'd or driven away all those hat defended it. But notwithstanding all this, the most cruel Battails were at Sea, because the Hol∣landers being stronger there, had absolutely taken away all things that were wont to be Chaffer between Equals in Power, by which means, the Spaniard had lost all benefit of Exchange. After this, if any Enemies could prevail so much in strength, as to infest all that Traded at Sea by Rob∣bery, they were called Pyrates. Hence it came, that the Fl∣drians, provoked by their frequent Losses, and such as fled out of the Hollanders Ships, conscious to themselves of any great Crime, (as such men generally are fierce) out of a desire both of Revenge and Prey, put to Sea, and not onely seized unarm'd Trading Ships, but many times indanger'd the more able: Many times it fell out, (and it is not to be forgotten, be∣cause it equall'd the greatest Adventures of Antiquity) that when any one part had, by Boarding the others Vessel, inter∣mingled their Companies, they in danger, rather than be ta∣ken, would, with Gun-powder, blow up both themselves and the Enemy; so much do they care, who despair of Life, not to dye unrevenged. The Kingdom of Spain, which hithero had been undistur∣bed, in the midst of all her Neighbour's Troubles, now first began to be sensible of a War brought Home to her; for the English, accompanied with the Hollander's Ships and Soul∣diers, advenurously Forage all the Sea-Coasts of Gallicia; afterwards they re-settle Don Antonio in his Kingdom, pitch∣ing
their Camp about Lisbone: The Queen sent out six of her Ships on this Design; the rest being One Hundred and Twenty, Sir Francis Drake Commanded: General Norris had the Conduct of the Foot Souldiers; the Prey taken, to be divided between them: And so great was their good Suc∣cess at the beginning, that Albertus of Austria, who was Governour of the City, in the Name of King Philip, had pre∣pared himself for flight: But by the Advice of some private persons, in regard of the doubtfulness of the Portugezes Al∣legiance, the small Provision they had of things necessary, and that several Diseases raged among them, springing chiefly from intemperate Drinking, they went away, and left all things unsetled; whether because King Antonio was not able to perform the vain Promises he made of the Peoples Affe∣ction to, and the Moors Assistance of him; or that their too suddain Departure spoiled the Design, is yet in doubt. But sure it is, the Hollanders were not hearkned to, who had both offered and shewed themselves ready, to defend and keep all the Castles and Forts on the Sea-Coast, as well as the Entrance into the Kingdom. As soon as ever the Siege was broke up, presently all who had at this time been observed by the Spaniard, to wish for a Change, were very severely punished. But the English did nothing more, unless that they made appear the weakness of the Spanish Grandezza, in that they were never hindred by them, either at their Landing, or during their stay; nor ever resisted them in the Demand or taking of their Forts or Castles; and a Fleet of Germans coming from the Baltick Ci∣ties, being met and taken as Prize, gave occasion to those Peo∣ple, by Legates, and Writing to contest among themselves, whether Provisions, wherewith People being at Peace with them, do help the Enemy, may rightfully be taken as Prize, and disposed of accordingly.
And now France, divided into parties, was ingaged in  like quarrel, after the King had caused to be slain the Duke of Guise, the head of that publike defection, nor did the King long survive Guise, being soon after assassined by a Monk; he was the last of the name and Family of Valois, in whose re∣venge, as also of the Duke of Guise, the whole Kingdom was divided into Arms. Without doubt, by the Customs of France, the right of Succession belonged to the Family of Bour, But Henry the head thereof, Prince of Bearne, who was call∣ed by the name of King of Navarre, though hardly enjoying any thing besides the name, for that the Spaniard had vio∣lently wrested it away, he, I say, professing the Religion which they call Reformed, though he promised equall Ju∣stice to both, had drawn to him all the Nobility, but the Cities and Towns would not receive or own him; But when he de∣clared himself a Catholike, the face of Affairs were on a sud∣den very much changed, for the fault of the defection from, and aversion to, the Kings Name and Title, was wholly call on the other; yet was not Philip terrified by this example, but that he now assisted the Duke of Guise his Brother (who made use of a double pretence of Piety) not in private, but in the view of the whole World, not that he so loved him, but that he might keep involved in discords that Kingdom, which ly∣ing between him and the Low-Countries, had formerly been very dangerous and troublesome to him; and if his designs were crowned with success, he would commit the same to some one of his own Allyance, with a fiduciary Power: And the Reason by him pretended for this, was, because he mar∣ryed Isabella, the Daughter of Henry the Second, King of France, by whom he had a Daughter, a Person most fit to go∣vern that Kingdom, either in regard to her Fathers Merits, or her Mothers Blood; and so much the rather, because the Dukedom of Bretaigne, as severall other Principalities of France were known to have been fortunately ruled by a Wo∣man's hand.
On the other side, the Duke of Savoy, the Spaniard's Son in Law, enlarged his Borders to the very opening of the Alps; The Queen of England being informed by a particu∣lar Envoy, that the Duke of Parma had sent Lamot into France, with an Army both of Horse and Foot, forthwith ordered a supply of mony to the King of France, together, with four thousand English Souldiers. Neither were the States of the United Provinces backwards in granting him Assistance; for first they sent Ships with Provisions, and all other neces∣sary Munitions for War, then adding thereto mony far more liberally than the present exigencies of their Affairs would permit, and this only in hope of a future benefit: It was certainly, a noble and an honourable act, and that raised an emulation towards their moderated Liberty, that they having so newly erected themselves into a Commonwealth, should yet by their Riches, support and help a Kingdom; the success thereof proving no less advantagious to the French, than di∣structive to their Enemies, while the Walloons Country, to whom formerly they committed their cause, lying open, and exposed to the mischief of War, was equally damnifyed, whether assaulted by the French, or their own Souldiers: Af∣terwards, the Spanish Forces, France putting a stop to their victorious times, lay open to the Hollander, who for eight years together, increased their Treasury, enlarged their bounds, and augmented their Armies, untill the Bourbonian, by his own vertue and valour, waded through all the threat∣ning billows raised against him by his obstinate adversaries, and himself at last becoming a Catholike, brought under his subjection all parties, rather laying aside his Arms, than the memory of that Pristine League. It seems here very convenient, now we are relating the French Affairs, to search, as far as humane Reason can direct us, how the Belgick troubles having the like beginnings, should yet have so different a Progress. For a Peace being setled formerly between King Philip and the King of France,
these two Princes seemed to be of one mind, having conclu∣ded a mutual League to extirpate all Religions which had be∣gun or increased, either by impunity or War. But the French Peers, hating the Guisian Potency, that they might not be∣come contemptible, as the Netherlanders to the Spaniards, took occasion to draw the multitude, now contending about Religion, into Tumults and Arms; but the Events were most unlike: for there the Subjects obedience was preserved entire, and consequently, the Roman Catholique Religion car∣ryed the day, but so only as to keep under, not oppress the other. But here the old Form of Government is altered, the differing Rites grow insociable, neither allowing the other, and so between Servitude and liberty become divided. The cause whereof I suppose may be, that the Guises or Lorraines being by themselves in private but weak, did afterwards re∣ceive from abroad such small help, as might indeed follow, but not force their Fortune. So that the main of their strength either consisted under the pretence of the Kings name, or the affections of the vulgar, which are mean supports, and of no duration, where there is any experiment of utility on the o∣ther side. And the Kings of France have within themselves, the whole strength of that one People; so that they diminish their own Authority by tyrannizing, and wholly loose what is spent in revenge. And the very Commons, though highly offended with the differences in Religion, yet when once they became sensible of the miseries of War, were not so de∣sirous of revenge as Peace. Hence proceeded those Edicts of Peace so often hastned, so often withstood by the now divided affections of the People, who might rather be said to lay aside War, than to make and observe a Peace; for being weary of a long War, they were driven to force and treachery, by the impulse of others, not their own obstinacy, and being always accustom∣ed to a Kingly Government, they might have been composed before, if the one King, famously knowing in the Arts both
of War and Peace, had tempered himself and his Laws, ac∣cording to the strength and prevalence of parties. They who were newly gotten into power, being ignorant how to use the time, nourished discords by variety of evill deeds, while they of a more active Spirit, or such whose Riot inca∣pacitated them, either got or lost all, and this was the only hindrance of Peace. But on the other side, the Spaniards ha∣ving a King that wished the same things in hatred to the Bel∣gick liberty, and who was now grown old in the enjoyment of his Territories, by the keeping abroad so great Forces, ne∣ver feared the Netherlandish Solitudes, especially having Pre∣sidents, both in Italy and America, that where they could not subject into Provinces, they should settle Colonies. But the French were highly offended with the pride, avarice, and cruelty of this forraign Nation, the very Catholikes them∣selves, who had never faltered in point of Religion, disliking their Customs, some of whom having been before circum∣vented and deluded with the hope of better things, becom∣ing an example to the rest, that they would with all violence exercise their malice, as mistrusting the breach of Peace, un∣der that notion, to hide their revenge. Thus a War, no less cruel than civill Wars use to be, con∣tinued, but still looked as forraign. But Count William in Frizeland, straitned the City of Groning, not able to resist the greatness of his endeavours, by scarcity and death, having wasted all their Provision about the Country; he got also Reide, a Peninsula of a very convenient Scituation between the River Emes and the Bay of Dullart. The City being suspected for this mischief, cast it upon Verdugo, because he had refused a Garrison: from thence being both recruited, this with a new addition of Foot, and Nassau with more Horse, sometimes with mutual fear, sometimes taking oppor∣tunities of daring one another, they spent the remainder of the Year.
The Second BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1590.THE whole burden of the War was ready to have been thrown upon Frizeland, if the ta∣king of Breda had not diverted the Army.  is a Town of Brabant, and hath ever been so esteemed though scituate in a fertile Soyl, upon the Confines of Hol∣land, and commanding over seventeen Villages. The River Aa, now having changed his name into Merca, and being of a reasonable breadth, washeth the Walls thereof, and shortly after, passing by the Town of Sevenberg, falls into an Arm of the Sea; The Family of Pole, bought it with the Title of Baron thereof, from whom it descended to the House of Nassau, by the Marriage of Engelbert, whose Nephews Son, named Henry, added to it a strong rampire and ditches, to∣gether with a most noble Castle, serving as well for beauty as strength. And since that the continual practices of War in those latter times, hath not only annexed thereto strong Bulwarks, and other defences for keeping out, or repelling of an Enemy, but also the glory of resistance of a most vio∣lent storm given to it; A Marriner taught the way how to take it by Policy or Stratagem, in manner following. By the Command of Philip of Nassau (he was the Son of John, who coming into this National War, had the Com∣mand of some Souldiers, and the government of a few Towns at the Maes) one Heraugier, a Captain of Cam∣bray, began first to consult of this Enterprise, adopting into Society, for performance of this Noble Exploit, one Lambert
Charly, a valiant and painful Souldier: The Vessell used for the Plot, was that which was wont, upon the Publique Ac∣count, to pass backward and forward between both Parties, to carry Fuel to Breda; which Fuel was no other, than the muddy Oze growing in the Marishes of Holland, hardned by the Sun, and cut out into Turf, and so served in stead of Wood; for the Het being inclosed in the Erth makes one like Nature and Disposition in Bitumen and Sulphur; which, as in other places, hath caused Mountains to burn and flame, so here sometimes they have made a very lightsome Fire, un∣less by chance some old Wood, beaten down with the force of the Sea and Tempests, and lying long cover'd with Earth, and grown rotten, onely changing his Form, yet retains its Nature: In this Boat, being of an indifferent length, were placed some young men, selected out of several Companies, and such as feared no danger whatsoever, to the number of Seventy, that were to be cover'd with a slight quantity of Tutfs, so as nothing else might be discerned: A long time it was, ere Fortune would favour this bold and dangerous At∣tempt, so that their Endeavours were contradicted and hin∣dred, even by such things as they had no doubt of: The cros∣ness of the Wind, and bitterness of the Cold, though at the very end of Winter; and, last of all, want of Victuals, which their stay had consumed, spoiled their first Assay: And certainly, among all these Delays, it was a very hard matter, to conceal such a Design as appear'd by certain Rumors writ∣ten out of England, that it was accomplish'd. However, at length, after they had refreshed themselves, and Herangier had comforted and encouraged them with good words, send∣ing a Messenger to Prince Maurice, to request him, to convey secretly some Souldiers into the next Island, not far from Breda, they once more set forward: Being brought within a Lock of the River or Scluse, near the Castle, from whence there was no possibility of going back, they were beset with a new Calamity; for either by the extraordinary Ebbe of the River,
or else by the grating force of the Ice, the bottom of the Boat was so cracked, that it began to take Water very fast: Th did the hidden Souldiers tremble for fear, cursing the Bo unfortunate Ribs, that could no better secure them, and all in Water up to the Knees; but at length, the Vessel eased by the Tides coming in, without any humane help, ceased to Leak. And now the Governours and Commanders of the Garrison, as it were out of an over-curious Care, more from the Use and Custom of Discipline, than any Necessity they thought of, had relieved the Guards, and appointed every inferiour Officer to his Post. Thus the Duty of searching the Boat, by the Negligence of many, was wholly thrown upon the Corporal, who likewise being careless, according to the Example of his Superiour Officers, viewing the same very slightly, made no more ado: And by good chance it for∣tuned, that the Cold had not forced any one to Cough, which at another time they could hardly have refrained. The Speech of one of the Souldiers, upon that occasion, deserves never to be forgotten; who fearing, least by his violent Noise in Coughing▪ (though he did repress it) he should, together with himself, betray his Companions: Kill me (saith be) Fellow-Souldiers, least we be all killed. But to proceed, after the search, the very Souldiers of the Garrison, drew the Boat into the Castle, that it might have Water, in regard the Ice was too thick abroad; by which means, they came into ano∣ther great Hazard, because the Danger so near and imminent, had put them all into a fear; so that they were ready to com∣plain of Herangier, as one who, desperate of his own Life, had brought them to the slaughter. Part of them being at the very Brink of Despair, would not stay for their hopes of safety, till the darkness of the Night, but since they must die, they would take the Day, that they might see the Enemy they were to encounter, least they should be found in that Prison, where they were penned up, and from thence be drag∣ged to punishment and Death. Others were utterly asto∣nished;
and certainly, it was rather Desperation made them accomplish their Undertaking, than any Exhotations of their Captain to Valour and Glory: Part of the Turf being unloa∣ded, and to prevent any further lightning of the Boat, least he should discover the Design, by laying open the Souldiers within, the Boat-man cunningly dissembled himself weary; and to that purpose, he put on a Garb and Tone, both of Voice and Countenance, even to Admiration: And now it was near Midnight, but with some glimmering of the Moon, when the Captain thought fit to bring forth the Souldiers; first, admonishing them to behave themselves valiantly, which would not onely be for their everlasting Honour, but Enrichment: But if any of them should now leave him in his adventurous Attempt, he would be so far from enjoying an honourable Life, that he merited an ignominious Death. By the working of the Pump, the Enemies Ears were stopped, so that they all went out, and not one of them discerned by the Sentinels, which was almost miraculous. Part of these Soul∣diers passing by the Armory, first killed those of the Watch they met with, and afterwards slew in their very Guard, those that kept the Gate which led into the Town, onely an En∣sign endeavouring violently to break through, and aiming with his Sword dangerously to have wounded Herangier, fell down, and was killed valiantly fighting: But Charly, to whom was given the Command of the other part of the Souldiers, drove the Enemies Garrison into the innermost part of the Castle, which was incompassed round with Wa∣ter. These were kept in hope, to the very utmost, by Paulo Antonio Lanzavecchia, who was Deputy-Governour of Breda, under his Father, a young Man, and utterly ignorant in Stra∣tagems of War. Odoardo Lanzavecchia the Father, Prince Maurice had caused to stay at Geertruydenburg, three miles di∣stant from Breda, seeming as if he would draw thither his Fortes, and Carriages; and, to that purpose, some were sent
under the notion of Spyes, who by spreading a false Rumour, should make them insensible of the Truth: And surely, the Duke of Parma was very much over-seen, who had commit∣ted two Towns to one Man's keeping, when one Man is hardly able to defend one Town, and let other Rewards, without Danger, be for such as deserve well therein. But Paulo Lanzavecchia, to try if, by chance, he could force this small Company out by Battel, passing out over the Bridge, sallyes upon the Enemy, with a Company of Men crowded together, (they were about Thirty and Six). But they were soon vanquish'd by them, who could not at that time be overcome, and himself sorely wounded, most of his men being kill'd, he fled back the same way he came. By this time, they heard a Noise of People, fighting within the City, and the Townsmen came to break open the Castle Gates that Heraugier's Souldiers might not drive away with their Shot out of the Gallery above the People, and clear the ad∣joyning Parts. At last the sign being given, that the Design had taken, Count Hohenlo presently marched up with a part of Prince Maurice his Army, who were not far off upon the Espyl; being come to the Gate, and perceiving the  made them lose time, they passed over the Lock or Damne, beyond the Palizadoes; nor did Paulo Lanzavecchia dee to Covenant for his own Safety, by the Surrender of what he held in the Castle. The Prince himself immediatly follow'd Hohenlo, with a∣nother greater part of the Army, consisting both of Horse and Foot, who, coming to the Gates, threatned to force them open: Then the City trembling, and deprived of the Gar∣rison that should have defended it, redeemed their Pillage with two Months Pay to the Souldiers; for the Italians,  whom the Guard and Defence of the Town was committed (being six Companies of Foot, and one Troop of Hor) whose Duty it had been to have broken the Bridge, be the Town and the Castle, or at least to have kept the Gate
from being seized by the Enemy, being struck into an amaze, at the noise and clattering of Arms in the Castle; and with∣all, not well agreeing among themselves, were easily wrought to fly, and leave all to the Enemy; and which, possibly, might be another Reason to the same purpose, being the more afraid of the Enemy, by how much they were generally ha∣ted by their Hosts who had quarter'd them; for that while they enjoyed the Town, they abstained from no sort of Vil∣lany, but raged in all kinds of Lusts. Therefore, when the Duke of Parma set himself to Re∣venge this popular Errour and Crime of the Souldiers, to take the shame from himself, all that were designed for pu∣nishment, as Fugitives and Renegadoes, though late, suffered the punishment inflicted on them for thei Fault, excepting onely one Intemelio, for whom his Youth and Nobility obtain∣ed a Pardon; and Odardo Lanzavecchia, as it were in pu∣nishment of himself, left off, and surrendred the Governorship of Geriruydenburg. Prince Maurice now entring the City, took into Com∣mand and Tuition, those his Antient, Paternal, and Heredi∣tary Possessions, and all the Citizens living therein; his Youth∣ful Modesty rather grieving at, than accusing the City, char∣ged with the Payment of the Souldiers Wages, (and many many more of them had their Names in the List, than were present in the Service) for the Prince would not seem to mind those private things, although the Sum amounted to a Hundred Thousand Florens, when Antwerp paid to the Duke of Parma but Four Hundred. These things thus done, the Government of the Town was bestowed upon Heraugier, and the rest were all of them af∣terwards both rewarded, and preferred to Honourable Com∣mands. The States Decreed Publike Feasting, and other Testimonies of Rejoycing, and that there should be Prices of Money Coined, which should be as a General Record to Po∣sterity of this first Victory obtained by their Prince, with∣out
the effusion of his Souldiers Bloud; which afterwards was drawn into Example by Custom, as oft as any great and prosperous Success crown'd their Actions. And there were not wanting some Wits, who Celebrated the Prince's Au∣spitious Beginnings, and magnified the Gallantry of the Design; averring, That the entring of Troy by Graecian Lords, in a Wooden Horse, was a Stratagem very like this, or, it may be, was an Eminent Ship so called. They compared the For∣tune of the Place, which nine years before, by the Absence of the Garrison, the Treachery of the Watch, and Slaughter of the Citizens, Altapen (Count Berlaymont's Son) surprized and took: Thus every Man's Fancy was in Agitation, but we must not dwell here. The Companies being left in the Town, which were to defend it, and some Troops of Horse, on purpose to make Incursions into the Villages of Brabant, the Army marched away: And the Provisions carryed in, by provident Care of those, whom the Prince knew had been privy to the De∣sign, served the place a long time: But as soon as a Messen∣ger brought News thereof into Germany, to the Prince of Parma; who, now weary of the Toil of War, it may be, by Advice, had desisted from Hostility, until he received Letters from Spain, least he should suffer, without taking Revenge, the Country to be spoiled, he commanded Charles Mansfeldt, who had Reduced Berck, to go thence with some part of his Forces, and to shut up all the Passages to Breda, in order to  Siege; being moved thereto by a false hope, that there was onely a few Days Provision in the Town; and besides, ima∣gining that the Townsmen would not be yet contentedly set∣led under their New Lords. On the one side therefore, Gertruydenberg straitned it; the rest Mansfeldt surrounded with strong Guards, yet they feared Relief would be brought thither from behind; for the River Merck runneth into the Maes, and maketh hard by many little Islands, which Prince Maurice had fill'd with Souldiers: And the River it self
where it runs by Breda, he had inclosed with a Bridge, and a strong Castle, at a place called Terheiden. From hence the Souldiers, highly enraged, match out to Sevenberg, a Town scituate in the further part of that Continent, and force it, to∣gether with a weak Castle belonging to it; their greatest la∣bour was spent about Nordam, which is a Castle scituate in a very moyst ground, and in former times, hath been often girt about with ditches, whereinto the Sea floweth, especially on the North part, and there is also a Redout, and the whole, by cutting away a part of the Bank, is washed by the Estuary of the Maes, like an Island; It was at this time defended by Matthias Hellye, one of the famous Adventurers in the ta∣king of Breda, who had as many Souldiers as he thought fit, out of the next Islands: After the Parmensians had spent some dayes in battering the place to no purpose, they prepared Bridges, and other Engines, and materials, for an assault, and therewithall, a Ship was set into the water, and Armed men stood round about in the Station, at the top of the Mast, that were, by the continual casting of Darts, to drive away the De∣fendants; The besieged, as soon as they saw it approaching, sent out in opposition to it, Boats set on fire; but the Wind averted that danger, and drove it (the Enemies Ship) to the Banck: And as it drew near, the strong eddy or Whirle∣poole of the River, turning it round, brought it into the Trench; some set upon it, as it lay upon the Shallowes, o her cast flaming fire-brands into it, and the Souldiers from the top of the Mast, are thrown down, lying open to all wounds, being obvious to the Enemy, on the contrary side was in∣tended; and so this stratagem wrought not its effect. Mansfeldt observing the great slaughter of his men, and the resolute fidelity of the Garrison, as also that he was no lesse worsted in the adjacent little Islands, began to doubt and de∣spair as well of the Siege of Breda, as of its being betrayed: And in the mean time, while he lingers in vain about the Town, the Horse that were therein, wearied him out with
daily Sallies and Skirmishes. But Prince Maurice, recollect∣ing his Souldiers, and though he had but a small Army (a∣bout four thousand Foot, and very few Horse) marched into Gelderland, as if he had had a design upon Nimmeghen. But the Engine prepared to the sudden assault, by the use whereof against the walls they would have fallen down, mis∣sed of its hoped success; this Engine was found among some French materials, it was in the form of a Hat, wherein were included Gunpowder, Bullets, and square pieces of Iron; thenceforth knowing the weakness of his Forces, and finding himself not fit for a Siege, because from the adja∣cent places, both Arms and Provision were daily brought into the City, he resolved to draw off, yet for a time he con∣tinued there, and wearied them at a distance, to try, if by that meanes he could possibly withdraw the Enemy fro Breda? which happened according to his expectation; for after both of them had thus vainly spent their time in Sieges, Mansfeldt, with his encreased forces, striving to help the neighbouring parts, because the City, in regard of the Soul∣diers known effeminacy, scorned his most able defences, pitched between the Maes and the Wael. But Prince Mau∣rice kept his Army within the Isle of Helland, and to prevent the Enemies passing over the River, he sent Ships into the Wael, and fortified the whole Bank of the River with Forts and Guards, from the division of the Rhne, unto the place where the Maes falls into it, in which place Count Sob (who commanded some Select Companies given to him by Prince Maurice) was ordered to intrench himself in the Isle of Voorne, as if he had been about to incamp. And a large cut was made from the Wal into the Rhine, whereby, without danger from Nimmeghen, any Forces or Provisions might be brought from, or carryed into Germany, and several great Banks erected to restrain the overflowings of the Rivers chiefly at the charge, and by the pains of the Hollanders,  were greatly benefitted thereby, as well in point of Security
as Trade; and Prince Maurice, at the same time, getting this safe defence, over against Nimmeghen, built a continuing Station for his Camp. The Souldiers gave it the name of Kndsenburg; from thence into the City, which pleasantly ariseth as it were out of the Bank, and from the City against the Workmen, there was a vast, nay almost an infinite ex∣change of Bullets. But they that wrought in the building of the Castle, did either work in the night, or were fain to set up blindes to preserve them from the Shot: But the greatest mischief afflicting the Townsmen, was the falling down of Towers, Steeples, and other eminent Structures, upon their heads, and ready with their falls to destroy them: So that now there was no safe Habitation in all the Town, and the River was quite taken from them; by which inconveniencies, being a People not used to War, and desirous of Commerce and Trade, by little and little, they were drawn to change their Masters. Thus was the Summer spent at Nimmeghen, when the Duke of Parma, having been again to drink the Spaw wa∣ters, and the success of his Affairs more luckily suiting his desires, began a little to recover his health; For Ricardot, a constant participater with the Duke, of all his Counsels, had brought back out of Spain to him very gracious and well-pleasing Letters, wherein, after his confirmation in his old Government, he received Orders concerning the French War; for the King was of opinion, that that being near, he would not refuse it, and that the difficulty of the underta∣king would make him forget his present cares; But the Duke of Parma was of another mind, which was, to leave the French to the division of their own quarrel, untill the Netherlands were wholly reduced or quieted. But well know∣ing, that Princes humours must be born by one that is enga∣ged, he made a vertue of necessity, imagining Honour offered him, which by himself must be made glorious by dangerous enterprises. Wherefore going into Henalt, that by his vici∣nity,
he might take care the more easily, Messengers follow∣ed him thither, with the news of Egmonds overthrowes, w the slaughter of his Auxiliaries at Eureux, and that the Con∣querours Army pressed hard upon the Parisians. And not l after, the Duke of Guise's Brother and Successor coming on him, to associate Counsels, he did publickly testifie that ill fortune of their parties: At last, after several debates, and private Consultations with the chief Commanders, concern∣ing the managery of the War, the Duke of Parma, towards the end of Summer, lead all the choyce and picked Souldi∣ers of the Kings Army into France. And new Levies fol∣lowed out of Germany, and those other Spanish Mutinees from Courtray and Menin, but before their departure, they compelled the Townsmen to give them part of their pay, and the rest they had from the King, and then was that presi∣dent instituted for perpetuity, that a Scue in payment to the Souldier, should be currant for ten Royals. The whole num∣ber of Foot was twelve thousand, and of Cavalry there were three thousand. The chief care of all Affairs in the Netherlands, was left to Peter Ernest, Count Mansfeldt, as Deputy Regent, the rest of the Souldiers left behind were committed to his S Charles, with order to put them into Garrisons, left any of them, by the want of their appointed strength, should incr any danger: As soon as Prince Maurice throughly under∣stood these things, he sent some, even as far as Germany, to take possession of the places they had left. All those Fornifi∣cations were taken, wherewith the Spaniard had beset the Banks, and passages of Journies, and the Works they had erected in that peaceable Country, by the Rhine and the Maes, were all defaced and overthrown: Another part of the Army made inrodes into Brabant and Flanders, being near to them, and brought thence booty, even out of the middle of the Country, and not only the Dorps and Villages, but the weaker Towns were assaulted, wo, and wasted▪
Thus in Autumn, he easily recovered what ever had been conquered by, or yielded to, Mansfoldt, the former year, by the side of the Maes, or about Breda, and utterly subverted all that was unnecessary: Besides these, he annexed his pa∣ternal Town of Steeneberg, famous of old for a Harbour; for it lies just upon a turning of the Merowe. Now the French War raged destructively, both at Sea and Land; the Governours of the Norman Coasts, having fought luckily against the King of France's Enemies in a Sea-fight; nor was any Policy omitted to facilitate the Victory. The Prince of Orange his men assaulted Dunkirk, both with Ships from Sea, and scaling Ladders at Land, and the Spani∣ards invaded Lochem by treachery, but both, by fore-know∣ledge, prevented their fate. There was a great rumour this year, of the Germans pre∣paring for a War, to vindicate and revenge their Borders, vi∣olated by the incroaching of their Neighbours; Now they, who began to meet in parties to take to either side, interpre∣ted all things to applause or contempt, every one as his Con∣science, or hatred to the Enemy, led him: For the Spaniards having gotten the furthest part of Frizeland, wasted both Vil∣lages, and the whole Country beyond the Rhine; Nor were the Garrison Souldiers of Gelderland, which lay about the Dukedoms of Cleues and Juilliers, any moderater, but rob∣bing that Country lying beyond them, they brought all the prey they got, into the Castles & Cities, where they were not questionable for the same. Then the Hollanders Horsemen, imitted the same licentiousness, when ever, having worsted the Enemy, they followed the pursuit: Thus being circum∣vented, now with hope of Peace, anon with the cruelty of War, they summoned a Dyet; where, after tedious delays, (as it is indeed the custom of that Nation) by protracting Counsels, sometimes even with threats, they rather delayed the remedies, than removed the evills.
At last, an Embassie was agreed upon, and Decreed;  to expostulate the Wrongs, and then to command them  desist from War, and all Acts of Hostility, unless within the Borders of the particular Adversaries. And, to this purpose they very carefully and judiciously debated the Point with the Duke of Parma, at the time he was going upon the French Expedition. Whereto he answer'd very sharply, being ac∣customed otherwise to shift off all Complaints of that na to wit, either by rejecting them absolutely, or answering them ambiguously: But this was the effect of his present Reply, That there had been many antient Differences continued among the Provinces, by reason of former Losses upon their Borders, and that now it was not in the General's power to set a form of War; but as they endured casuall Fires, Innundations of Waters, and other Evils either of Nature, or Fate; so they had better  bear with the present necessities of the Times, than to begin a Qua∣rell with the impatient undergoing thereof: But if former Enemies would depart thence, with all Strangers, then he also would re∣store what property belonged to the Germans; always provided, that the Money which was expended in the War of Colen, a secured to the King: In the interim, they should consider, that there were a necessity that they must suffer, certainly the old Reli∣gion best merited their Patience, for whose onely sake he was s for into Germany. What, is the Example grown dubious, by increased Liberty, whom to regard best? Of old, these Warlike People have been wont to observe all the Motions of their Neigh∣bours, and to have a care of their own strength, that they might cast down any Neighbour Paince that were weaker, much more now when they dare so much against a Powerfull King. You ought rather to pray to God, that whoever is in the fault of the War may being either overcome in Battel, or conquered with Repentance, be forced to return to their first Obedience and Duty; and that th would not be long a doing, if by the deniall, and cutting off all Tra∣ding
and Provision, they were couped up within their own narrow Limits. With this Answer being dispatched, they go to the Con∣federate Provinces with greater Confidence, and more mala∣pert Demands: For first, they required the delivery of the Island of Gravewaerdt, together with all other things which they possessed on their Borders: And after, that the Passa∣ges of the Rhine be free, and without Guards and Forts; and neither the Rhine, nor the Ems, being both German Ri∣vers, to be thereafter encombred with the Terrour of Fleets, nor the Payment of Tributes. To this, the States answer'd, That they hoped they should make their Endeavours appear more just, and should truly lay the blame of disturbing the Peace upon the Enemy, which they, without Reason, aspersed them withall: And so beginning with the Causes arising from the Inquisition, and the grievous punish∣ment inflicted by it, they proceeded with their throwing off Bishops, and at large demonstrated the Murther of the Nobles, the Oppressions of the Commons, and the other Miseries of Slavery. By these Injuries (say they) being neces∣sitated to take Arms, we seek no other thing, by this so tedious and dangerous War, but to free our Bloud and Relations, o Wives and Daughters Bodies, from Barbarous Cruelty, and Be∣stiall Abuse and Muckery. This onely is the hope, this the end, of all our Fighting; and we hope our Poverty will be no more spigh∣ted or envyed, than the strong Commonwealth of Switzerland, which is terrible to its Neighbours. It is more reason to fear, and more just to resist, those great Robbers of the whole World, whom neither the vast Solitudes of America, the Slaughters of People, both in Granata, and the Netherlands, nor the Servitude of Portugal, and a great part of Italy, is able to satisfie: And as both among Beasts and Fishes, the greater and more ravenous sort live upon Prey, so inferiour States are always obnoxious to the Hatred and Fury of greater Empires. Is it a thing unknown, by whose Design chiefly the English were sollicited to Sedition? Who
made Ireland Rebell, and caused the French oppose their law∣full King? It behaves you therefore to be wary; for even among you the Spaniard hath such, as, hired by him, are ready  advise or act what suits best to his Advantage: Nay, they  hath their sight, are yet, out of fear, compelled to obey them,  may be observed among the Indians, who reverence them as they do Evil Spirits, that they may not hurt them. He, (to wit, Pa∣a) without blame undermines by Treachery the Cities of Cle Others are voluntarily delivered as a Pledge of Friendship, by him whose due they were, as the Revenue of his Ecclesiastical Pro∣tions, as is said, which now are really become trusty Recep∣cles of Villany, and so many Dens for Robbery. Nay, the most opulent and wealthy Prince, when his Souldiers want Money pts out you for their Pay Masters, and whole Regiments of Souldiers, as well as others, are made fat with German Tri∣butes. We, at this time, onely strive for this that we may not suf∣fer an unlike Fortune, in a like Cause: We, certainly, if ever  People, labour to keep our Souldiery unblameable, and peaceable to∣wards all our Neighbours, by our constant Pay to them: Our Sub∣jects bear us Witness, and the Legal Punishments inflicted on  that are guilty, that as far as War is to be Governed, we strive preserve the Peace of all that do not disturb us: Onely herein,  hope, you will pardon us, if sometimes the Souldier takes may upon him, than the Officers or Magistrates. We have hitherto maintained the antient Estimation of Holland, even in the Mis∣chiefs of War, among the most remote Nations; much less shal we, the antient Companions and Followers of the Romane Pro∣wess, and so near allied in Bloud to the Germans, by any Perfidy violate that Great Parent, which always furnished us with Cap∣tains, instructed us in Vertue, and shewed us the Example of Li∣berty. As for Gravewaerdt, the chief Government of it long before the War, and Charges of a Disputed Right, belonged to Gelderland, as standing in that Jurisdiction; We hold it not to injure others, but to defend our Selvss, and our Borders; And for the rest of the Towns and Castles, although being taken from
the Enemy, they lost their Priviledge of Peace, yet we shall wil∣lingly yield them; that as Force first began from the Spaniard, so with us Right shall be both a beginning and Example. The Bur∣den laid upon Trade, that passeth our Borders, is nothing so heavy to our Neighbouring Nations, as to our own People; they have necessitated by War, though they be no other than such as are fre∣quently demanded and taken by most Potent Princes; And to re∣move our Guards of Shipping, when the Enemy lies all about the Rivers, is not consistent in Policy with Safety; but they are rather Safeguards to all such as pass that way, and likewise defend you, as well as our Selves. About this time, there came also an Embassie both from Colen and Leige, Bojoarus was Bishop of both places: Where∣fore the States, not medling with the cause of Truxius his Quarrel, they complained of many things against the Bi∣shop, whose unasatiable Avarice took Confidence onely from the Spanish Greatness assisting him: However, they as∣sured to Colonian's Safety and Peace, if (as standing in the middle) they would onely converse with Parties, as Neu∣ters: But the Condition of them of Leige was far different, having both done and suffer'd, by connivence, many Acts of Hostility: Against them also was objected, the punishment of such as were innocent, under colour of vindicating Reli∣gion; and afterwards, when the rest of the Netherlands were possessed by the Spaniards intermixedly, they so openly set out for them Winter-quarters, and raised Summer Provisions, that, if we may not plainly say, it was a Voluntary Act; yet we may well say, it was not Compulsory: And therefore, to hope for Peace, where they had so deserved; and in the interim, upon Order, to send away their Prisoners, there was little Reason. It would not be amiss, or any ways absurd, to dive further into these Matters; that both the Reason of War, against the adjoyning Cities, and what Peace they may expect, may be understood: And indeed, after this, there was Freedom ta∣ken
both for Rapine and Injuries, as every Province inclined hither or thither, out of fear of Danger, or sometimes out of Design. They hardly ever took a Voyage free from Arms and Force, while both endeavouring to get away, by that very means drew on the Enemy. Thus, in several renewed Em∣bassies, there was nothing but the same over again heard at spoken: But the Hollander yielded up several strong Holds, as desired; but, in truth, because they were so far distant, that they could not easily be maintained, or defended; and that they might thereby heap upon the Spaniard Envy, if not bring upon him a War, because he would perform none of those things, which before he had agreed to: And there were some in the German Dyet, who would have nothing but Force and Arms used against them, for neglect of performing their Promise. But the other Princes and Bishops, who continued all in one Society of the Catholike Religion, or were otherwise ob∣liged to one another, broke the strength of that Design to use Force, by procrastinating Consultations, and the hope of a Pacification with the Netherlands. And now some were sent from the Confederate States to complain, that they were be∣trayed by the Treachery of their Enemies, and the careless Sloth and Neglect of their Friends; They having given a∣way from themselves the Rewards of their Pains and Charge in the War, (for as yet Truxius did not appear) while Phi∣lip, yet unquestion'd, kept possession of all the Cities near the Rhine: Nor could they obtain of the Emperour any whit the less every year, to forbear to assist the Spaniard with Arms, though he saw them averse to the desired Peace. At the end of the year, the Duke of Parma returning from France, was afflicted and vexed with many things, though he brought with him the Honour of having freed Paris from a cruel Siege, and bringing his Army Home safe, from among so many dangerous and mortal Enemies: For both himself, and his Army were hated by the French Commons, and the
Cities would not receive Garrisons of his Men, for fear of Forreign Servitude; so that here all Philip's hopes were bla∣sted, and he found there was no relying on such uncertain Friendship. Another of his Vexations, was, That by the Enemies Ex∣cursions, most of the Fortifications, through the whole Ne∣therlands, had been Reduced; That Verdugo in Frizeland▪ onely taking the small Castle of Ementell, had in all other Maters of War been unfortunate, and the Souldiers at that present were ready to Mutiny: And the Townsmen of Vene (a place in Gelderland, near the Maes) startled him; for they being perplexed with the tedious Evils of a double Garrison; first, by the help of the German Souldiers, drove out the Italians, and afterwards taking more courage, be∣came too strong for them, and turned them out. Besides an∣other Sedition grew more violent among the selected men, hastned through Germany by Mansfeldt, to hinder Prince Maurice his Progress, because he had provided for the new raised men, part of their wages, and debarred the rest from any: This Mansfeldt was an old Commander in the War, & that made them rage against him more furiously. Thus being about Herentals, and other adjacent Towns of Brabant, as if they had been Enemies, they spoiled all that part of the Coun∣try, which is called Kempenlandt, yet pretended themselves the Kings Souldiers; and if any resistance was made against them, neither Rapes, Murthers, or any other villany, was by them accounted unlawfull. Thus while they harassed the Fields, though the pay de∣creased, yet their number that demanded it, was increased. But the Duke of Parma said, that he suspected, the Souldiery ought to have been dispersed into severall fortifyed Cities, and there mixed with the new raised men; Indeed, it was time to shut the Stable-door; when the Horse was stollen; And this Counsel coming too late, served to little purpose otherwise, for surely, the onely removing of the mischief to
another place, was but miserable comfort to a publick ∣lamity. But this Advise brought not to them so much  but instead thereof, more seditious Souldiers daily came to∣gether, who being wearied with a hard and pinching J quickly laid hold of that opportunity, to ease themselves and forcibly to seize those rewards which their Command had formerly denyed them; But the Duke of Parma had  some Companies in France, with the chief Commander of the Guisian Faction, to whom the Prince of Ascoli was com∣manded to conduct some more, according to their desire. 1591. The Enemies Forces being in this manner divided and the Souldiery remaining at home, disobedient and ∣fractory, or else but lately raised: the confederate Pro∣ces, fleshed with the last years success, now took heart, and they who before could scarce defend their own bounds with∣out great fear and hazard, now resolve to invade others. Some perswaded them to forbear, till the Duke of Par was gone into France; but others thought it best to lay  of all opportunities; and if they did nothing else, yet it  well worth their time and labour, to hinder the Duke of Par∣ma's Journy into France. Neither did they continue long  suspence, from what part to begin their business; for although the Frizos desired their ayd, yet it was of great concern∣ment to them, to free Issell from Garrisons of Spaniards, to whom all Gelderland, as well the Betuwe, as the Velume, and the others that were near, for fear of the Hollanders incu∣ons were tributary, the which, grievously enslaved, ever since the Prince of Aurange his time, they had omitted, hindered either by their own weakness, or the Enemies power. As soon therefore as the time of going abroad to forage was come, and the Souldiers numbers compleated, and their pay ordered among them, Sir Francis Vere, (whom the Queen had made her General of the English) first went toward De∣burg. Some few of his men in the habit of Country-women with Baskets, running as if they fled from a following Ene∣my,
got into the Fort that lies over against Zutphen, onely se∣parated by the River, whereinto they were no sooner entred, but quickly laying hands on their Weapons, which were hid under their Cloaths, partly with the, and partly with Wea∣pons taken there, they killed the first Sentinels, ere they were aware, and afterwards, the rest surprized with amaze and fear, were easily either killed or taken. Vere, had not held the Fort above one day, when Prince Maurice came thither with all his Army of eight thousand Foot, and two Wings of Horse, making two thousand; they brought with them, all things necessary for the assault of a Town: And for the more ease of the Pince, there attended a Selected Counsel of the Senate, to the Companions of his Cares. But fame hereof coming to the Enemy, it was believed, the Army was bent against the Cities of Brabant▪ or ele to take Gertruydenberg, because a few dayes before, the Sui∣ers had in those parts taken Forts and Castles: And he Prince forwarded in them this error, at first, by a doubfull march; as if he intended to go to the Maes; but on a sudden, at the winding of the Rhine, turning into Issell, there met him Count William, and two thousand Frizons, drawn out of the Garrisons. Here Intelligence was received, both from Sir Francis Vere, and some Prisoners, that the Banck was to be possessed. Here the Enemy was secure, in other places he was afraid; and therefore, that the City was neither well fortifyed, nor victualled but for a few dayes; That the be∣sieged, before any Relief or Provisions could be brought to them, might be taken by foce, there no being in the Town above six hundred Armed men, and nothing considerable of force, could be raised by the Citizens, most of them having formerly left the place, to avoid the Souldiers insultations. At the very first Skirmish, Count Falcosteyne, the chiefest of all Truxius his Commanders was slain, while he too furiously pursued the beaten Enemy flying into the Town, but his body
was fetched off, and rescued from villanous usage. Upon the River were placed Ships, fixed with Anchors, in form of  Bridge, which reaching orderly from Banck to Banck, joyn the Souldiers Quarters together with a safe passage;  from thence, others were commanded to dismantle all  Guards upon the wayes; and another part were ordered  draw oblike and crooked Trenches up to the Castle, that  the casting up of the Earth, they might come, safe from the Enemies Darts or Shot, up to undermine the very Walls and to this work, the night was designed. The Seamen and Marriners, whose readiness and co in Maritime Affairs, was here of very great use, for th brought thirty great Guns, with more celerity, than Horse part into a little Island in the River, and part against the main Buildings of the City, that they might with the conti∣nuall Thunder thereof, shake and, overthrow that part of the Works which was weakest, in regard the River was of it  a strong defence. But in the City, though struck with a s∣den fear, yet they ran up and down every where, to prev the Enemies endeavours, they increased the Rampies at the Gate, shut up by the foe, and within began new Works, by which time, a certain number of Cannon being shot off, ac∣cording to Military Custom, Messengers were sent by the Prince, with threats of the greatest extremity, unless they would submit and render the Town: They pray a time to consult, but that would not be granted; whereupon, consci∣ous to themselves, of the want of many things, and how f they were to defend the large circuit of the Walls, they  rendered upon Articles, that the Souldiers should march a∣way safe and undisturbed, and the Townsmen, if they ple∣ed, might stay, being ordered and governed according to the Laws and Customs of the confederate Cities. According to which conclusion, many Sieges afterwards being ended we shall not so often repeat the same.
The Spaniards found fault with the too hasty rendition of the Town, and therefore the Governour of it, as long as the Duke of Parma lived, was never suffered to come to Court. The fifth day, after the beginning of the Siege, was Zutphen delivered: it stands in an excellent Scituation, the River Bark runs through it, Issell passeth by it, as it comes from phalia, and not far off falling into the Rhine, by the la∣bour of Drasus, as it is believed. This with her neighbour-Towns and Country was of old subject to the Princes there∣of, who were called Earls; and there remains a distinct  of Jurisdiction, though it be now united to the body of Glderland, not so much, by reason of its scituation be∣yond the Rhine, as by the intermarriages of Princes: Upon the same Banck stands Deventer, formerly a free City of the Ausike League, and the Metropolis of Over-Issell, under the Bishops power: Hither when the Army came with a swift march, at the very sight thereof, they were at a non-plus, not knowing what to do. But the strong Fortifications of the City, and the greatness of the Garrison, whereof the Army had Intelligence, being one hundred Horse, and fourteen Ensigns of Foot, made the Prince at a stand. Herman, Count Hernberg, was Governour thereof, both an instructer, and an example of vertue and fidelity, he was neerly allyed by blod to Prince Maurice himself, as being born of his Aunt, and therefore so much the more envying the glory and splen∣dor of his Kinsman: Above all, the Duke of Parma was feared, least he should draw together Forces, and come and disturb them in their Siege, which if it should happen, there would be a necessity for them, either shamefully to fly, or doubtfully run the hazard of a battel. And the taking of Zutphen, as it was a great incourage∣ment to all that hoped well, so was it a warning to others, that they should not endanger their gotten Honour, but ra∣ther preserve it for more certain advantages: On the other side, some that fled out of the City, brought Intelligence, that
the Souldiers were ready to mutinie, that there was not Vi∣ctuals to serve against a long Siege; nay, that they had not Gunpowder enough in any proportion for their Guns: which being understood, the middle course was resolved on, to wit, that they should with all speed, fortisie their Camp, stop  all passages both by Land and Water, that no Messenge might be able to get to them with newes of Relief: But if the Enemy should hold out, it would be sufficient, that all the Bancks being guarded, they might for the future; easily passe to the other side, and force them, and this was the sum of the Counsel, before the expedition was undertaken. Prince Maurice making a continual battery against the Town, upon the ninth day, to try the mindes of the besieged, drew up his Army before the Walls; then commands some Ships to be forthwith carried into the Channel, where the River passing by the City, is somewhat stopped, and to place them near the shore: These, in regard they could not be rowed, because of the narrowness of the River, some Seam drew under the very Walls with their hands, in spight of al the Enemies Shot; an undertaking certainly of such a na∣ture, as many couragious men, would have shrunk at: The Boats being placed in the very trench, and a Bridge made over them, every one was ready to take upon him the sho and assault, to merit the Princes prayse, who called it an ho∣nourable piece of Service, though it was not a work for or∣dinary Valour; Thus while they made so much hast, they hindred the Engineers, and the Bridge it self being a little too short, did not reach over to the other Bancks; The Wall is this place, together with an adjoyning Tower, was partly beaten down by the force of the battery, part of it yet being supported by Arches (for it was an antient Structure) and heaps of Earth thrown into the hollow places thereof; The choyce men that were to give the onset, and if they entred, to make good the place, were many of them drowned, some few onely attaining the shore by leaping.
I cannot in this place, passe by the glorious emulation of two Ensigns, the one of whom being killed upon the top of the Walls the other brought off both his own Colours, and those of his slaughtered Companion; But all this time, the Cannon did the greatest harm to the Enemy, yet could not force them from the Walls; for being full of Wine, they made rather a desperate than a valiant defence; Here in the first place, Count Herman fought with more than necessary Valour (in regard he was the Governour of the Town) but he did it to make good his Honour and fidelity. (For some Spaniards had not stuck to report, that it was an agreed de∣sign between the two Kinsmen.) Nor did he go away before the showres of Bullets yet continuing thick, he was in the darkness wounded. All night, the Princes men were fain to defend the Bridge from being burned, for the Enemy conti∣nually cast fire at it. As soon as the Day again appear'd, and the Enemy now grown sober, saw plainly the Prince's Army before them in Battel Array, and the Bridge whole, the sight being also rea∣dy to begin again; then they considered their danger, espe∣cially upon the Return of some that had been sent as Spies; who reporting the Prince's strength, with the greatest Ad∣vantage, made their disgrace (in case they surrendred) to seem the less: Count Herman alone would not consent to surrender, but he being very ill with his Wounds (though he might suffer the Rendition, yet) could not hinder it: For the Townsmen now called to the Souldiers that guarded the Bridge, that they might have liberty to Treat; whereof the Prince being informed, and receiving from him safe Con∣duct, they went out: The Townsmen were left to the Con∣querours Mercy, and that thereafter they should have Magi∣strates appointed, not according to their own Laws and Cu∣stoms, but as should be thought convenient by the Ʋnited States of the Reformed Religion: And it appeared, that as Zutphen, so also Deventer, did not reckon the Spaniards
should dwell amongst them for ever; for that before the Siege they burnt their Huts, although they had not long be∣fore Wood enough: Before their departure, all the Captains and Officers were deliver'd bound, in vain lamenting the own Necessities, and the Civil Discords: But Count H would not believe, that the States were able to raise such numerous Forces; yet he, having been Governour, durst not go into the Spanish Quarters, fearing bitter and invete Accusers, and prepossessed Judges. Fit Garrisons being  placed in the Cities lately taken, the Frizons beseeched  That now at last he would think of them, whose Peace was di bed by the pertinacious Obstinacy of one single City; and that  remained now but a few Towns and Castles, which if they were ta∣ken, the whole Country, between the Rivers Issel and Ems, would be free from the Enemies Incumbrances, and be intirely in the States Power: So much was their hope advanced, by these first Successes, that they, who till this time hardly durst un∣dertake any thing, now on a suddain, did not boggle at the most adventurous Enterprizes. With great speed therefore, an Expedition into Frizeland was begun; and least, in the absence of the Army, the Enemy should make any Im∣ons, the Regiments lately raised in Holland, were ordered to keep good and strong Guards upon the Wael. The Prouisions of War, and all other Things that might impede their Jour∣ney, being put aboard some Ships, were carryed out of the Is∣sel into the Zuyderzee, and so through the Ocean to the River Ems. The Souldiery, by this means, free from Porsage, onely in passing over the Marshes, they carryed, besides their Daily Provision, Faggots, were led into that part of Over-Issels which is called Drent, where the People had inclosed their Marshy Grounds, with a great many young Shoots of Places growing together; for the Enemy stopped the better way, being possessed of Coevorden, which some did advise the Ar∣my to take as they went, least from thence the Enemy should
pe them in the Rear; averring, that Verdugo, who kept that Castle, might easily be beaten thence, either by some Stratagems, publike Force, or want of Victuals: But this Cel was not approved, by reason of the difficult bring∣ing either of great Carriages for Battery in a Land-March; and also, because there was less necessity of fighting at Groe∣g. Among many other inconveniencies, the Army met with, in their March thither, one was a Meor, containing in  Three Thousand five hundred Paces: And though the upper Crustiness of the Turf was so hardned, notwith∣standing Natural Moisture underneath, that it would endure a few to go over it; yet such as follow'd in the Third or Fourth Rank, sunk so deep into the yielding Mud, that they could hardly be drawn out, though sometimes their Captains came, and gave their helping hand to them, that so the Toil might not seem so grievous to the Souldier; and in a few hours the whole Army had passed it, which all the Inhabitants thereabouts had thought impossible to be done: But the Soul∣diers could not be restrained, by any Authority, to forbear Injuring to the Country as they marched, according to the Evil Custom of Armies, their pilfering, stealing, and wasting of what would have served for many days, had almost cau∣sed want of Provision; and that would have bred a Sedition, but that the Ships came in season, loaded with Provision, to prevent the same. Now were all the Tents pitched about Groening, where the Prince conceived a good hope of Suc∣cess, from the variable and unconstant behaviour of the Vul∣gar, against those in Authority, as also from the Discords within the City: But indeed, too confident in their words, by Relations above Truth, had for their own advantage drawn the Army thither: 'Tis true, there were some with∣in, who remembred the League of Union, but they were over-powred by the adverse Faction. Moreover, Verdugo, upon the Report of the Armies coming into those Parts, had
strengthned both Steowic, and Coevorden, with Garrisons; and with the Remainder of his Forces was come to Groening before Prince Maurice; yet was not for all that admitt within the Gates, (for the City when it first submitted, ex∣cepted that one particular) but kept his proper Guards in the Suburbs, as well to the Terrour, as the Aid of the City. The Prince not staying above six days there; for fear the City should, as out of Necessity, admit that Garrison within their Walls, and so, for the future, all their hopes be utterly lost; an likewise because he heard the Duke of Parma was pre∣paring an Army to raise the Siege, on a suddain falls upon all the circumjacent Forts, whereby all the Ways and Passages of Rivers were stopped: And which had in the Series of this long War, been often subverted by the Frizons, and as often re-built. Great was the Fear and Dread of the Souldiers, as having been more accustomed to Theft and Depopulations, than Fighting; few of them enuring more than the very sight of the Caon and the weake places they left without any Siege at all: The greatest Castle of all named Delfeziel, and famous for a Hven, where Fivel falls into the Ems, was held by Souldiers of Groening; the conveniency of the place, had, of old, wough upon all, that desired the Dominion of the City, to get or keep i; which the Duke of Alva attempted, but was hindred by the Times. The States now having got∣ten this place, inlarged the Old, and strengthned it with new Works making the Tributes of the places near thereto, bear the Charge; dividing the Sea-Bank from the Rampire, and building Houses therein, threaning Groening; That unless they repented, they would not leave it any Inhabitants. And at the same time, a great w of all Things shrewdly tempted the inclosed to alter their Faith, and consequently their Lords: But after the Prince had drawn away his Army, Ver∣dugo making his way by force, through the weakest Fort, opened a Passage to the City, out of Westfalia, by Bourtange:
But the Duke of Parma coming too late, to help either Zut∣, or Deventer and imagining the Enemy durst not have uted so far, for that many of the Spaniards, by reason of their ill pay, would not be commanded, doubtful whither he should lead his Forces, being now met together about the Maes and the Rhine, either to distract the Enemy in his De∣sign or to match after him voluntarily, which would be the more noble, and so to help Groening, as he was desired: he was deterred from the latter, by the excessive greatness of the Iourney; and besides, all the Country lying between, was wasted and spoiled, either by the Frizon Souldiers, or his own. Wherefore, at last, he resolved to answer the desire of Nimmeghen; whither being come, he commanded the River to be passed over, and the Fort, which Prince Maurice had the former year begun, to be besieged; himself would do all that was necessary in the City: Count Barlaymont lay up∣on that side of Knodsenburg, which looks Eastward: Another was Beleague'd by Octavius, Count Mansfeldt, who was shortly after shot by the Besieged, and dyed of the Wound: He was a Noble Person, and although but young, yet ambi∣tious of Honour, and for the winning thereof, would shun no danger. The back-side of the Fort was inclosed by the Horse, and some other Regiments. Lamotte brought thither the Artillery with ease, by the help of the Rising Bank; He af∣terwards finding the Bulwark too strong for the Cannon, though a great part of the Ravelin was beaten down, and see∣ing the Enemy were not terrified, at the sight of the Army drawn up in Battel Array against them, filled the Trench with Oziers, and other Boughs, and after that sends some privately to undermine the Bulwark; they, in the mean time, who were to fill the Ditch, helping the Work forward, with many of their dead Bodies. But the Defendants, that were Six Hundred, under the Command of Gerard Junius, a Man of great Courage, were ready in all places, to answer the Force or Policy of the Enemy with Shot, and otherwise;
many times, by successful Sarlies, disturbing their enterp∣sed beginnings. At this time Prince Maurice had left Groening, and was going against Steenewie, when heating of the Siege of K∣senburg, he left Count William to defend the Frizons, and himself, with a flying Army, coming to Arnheynie, an Ie of Holland, by Signs, encouraged the Besieged; and likewise from thence sent Messengers, that got through the adverse Army, unespy'd by Night in a Boat: But the Nassania Commanders differ'd in Opinion, whether they should  the Enemy in the Field, and fight him; or, passing the Ri∣ver Wael, should fortifie themselves, and hinder their Adver∣saries of Provision, and make them leave the Works and Guns, they had setled upon the side of the Hill by Ni∣ghen: There was difficulty and danger in both these At∣tempts; for, without all doubt, the Enemy was stronger in Horse, whose Force and Valour they had often tryed, both in Fight and Forraging. At length Fortune determin'd their Doubt, which many times is as profitable as Prudence; for the Prince, with Count Solms, and Sir Francis Vere, being brought near the Enemies Camp, hid part of the forwardest Regiments, with some Troops, among the Thickets adjoyn∣ing to the way: Other part of the Horse were commanded to march a good way forward, to draw on the Enemy, upon whose approach, they were to seem to fly, as if they were overpower'd, (for most of the Italians in Ten Troops, among whom was the Duke of Parma's own Lifeguard were come out to pursue them) and they were not to face about, till they had drawn the Pursuers beyond the River, and a narrow Bridge that went over it; which being brought to pass, according to expectation, suddainly they that fled, tur∣ned again; and the others that lay in Ambush coming in, they were inclosed, and every valiant man among them dyed in the place he stood; the rest were scatteringly slain, as they
were met with, onely some few, while the Conquerours took the Ensigns, and some prisoners alive, and the Horses, escaped and fled to the Camp: With the grief whereof, and the loss of so many noble and valiant men, not thinking it safe any longer to stay in the Enemies quarters, he gave over his vain Siege; but pretending, that he was commanded to march once more into France, and that the great Affairs of the Kingdom were not to be neglected, in striving to win a few Forts or Castles in Holland: Wherefore, sending the Car∣riages before, he Transported his Army, having onely built some slight Works upon the River, to keep the Nassauians in play, least they should fall upon his Rear; and as soon as his Army was all over the Water, he commanded them to make a stand, that they might secure the ships coming after them: But the City was highly displeased at his departure; some few spoke of him favourably; most smother'd their Anger in a threatning silence; but the baser sort of people cover'd nothing of their Madness, but shew'd their Fury in their Speeches; as if they could by them draw back an Old General, that fled at the sight of a stripling Enemy. Undoubtedly, Parma's Mind, having always been accu∣stomed to win Honour, was grievously afflicted with this Disgrace; so that his former Disease, now again increasing, be, together with his Son Ranutio (who lately came out of Italy, augmented his Fathers Vexation, that he should be a Witness of his Misfortune) went to the Spaw; there, among the variety of his present Discontent, and former Fortune, to drink of the Waters. From thence he sent to the Mutinous Spaniards at Diest; for pacifying whom, he gave a very pre∣judicial Example, to wit, That Emanuel Vega a Captain, who was more severe, than the Villany of the Souldiers would bear, should be displaced, and another put into his room. The Citizens of Nimmeghen did many of them begin to look after Liberty, especially after Desperation had multiplied those Evils, which before they had scarcely undergone, with
the Promises and Expectation of better Things: For six years before, following the Duke of Parma's good Fortune;  by a general Consent, but the Faction of a small Party, when the Government of the United States, after a long time, and by much care, came to be setled, (without whose Consent, what∣ever Duty or Obedience they shewed, was without any Af∣fection) yet they chose Safety and Profit: And from that time, there began a mutual Commerce between them and the Hollanders, who suffer'd the Ships of Nimmeghen to go through the Wael; because then the Channel of the R wanted Depth of Water to bear them. But in the Garrison were Three Companies, one of Forreigners, two of men i∣sed within the Town, (for they positively refused to admit of more) and as any one offended more heinously the parties of the great Ones, they would, by vertue of their received Power, threatningly restrain or punish the Offenders. There wanted now onely a close Siege, least the Enemies Forces should lye at lurch about the Maes; and that was onely de∣layed by the excessive increase of Water in the Wael, so that there could not be had any use of a Bridge: However, the Souldier rested not long quiet in his Winter-quarters, though they were purposely at a great distance, the more to increase the Conquering Enemies Security: For Prince Maurice, prosecuting his good Fortune, draws out of his Garrisons part of the Regiments, and with them marches over the Scheldt into the Land of Wase; and at the same time, the Horse made an Intoad into Brabant: And the fifth day after, ha∣ving taken all the Forts thereabouts, Hulst, a Town in that Province, was deliver'd to him: The suddainness of the Action amazed the Garrison Souldiers, (for the Governor, by chance, was gone out of Town before the Siege, upon private occasions of his own) and also, because the Prince had digged through the Bank, to make the River overflow all the adjacent places, and by that means stopped the Enemy from assisting them.
The whole Land of Wase was given to the Souldiers, to spoil and pillage, until they promised Tribute, and sent Ho∣stages to the States, for payment of the same: But the Neigh∣bours of the Hollanders, seeing all the best of their Fruits, and other Provisions, possessed by the Enemy, Prince Maurice's Army being gone, as fearing to have bin met with unawares in the Enemies Country by the Duke of Parma, cause Mon∣dragio, the Governour of the Castle at Antwerp, to take Arms; who, accordingly, with the next Souldiers he could get, and such as lived about the Maes, goes over the Scheldt, but not daring to look upon any Town, (for Count Solms defended them, and Repaired the Works) he reco∣vered the Forts and Sconces in the Country, and Erected some nw ones, for the straitning or cutting off Excursi∣ons. Hereupon, the Inhabitants of the Country denyed their promised Tribute, supposing, and not without Reason, that the Clemency of the Enemy would not break its wonted bounds, and revenge the injury upon the innocent pledges. All things succeeding thus, even beyond his wishes, the Prince once again drawing his Souldiers out of their winter-quarters, goes into Gelderland, which the Enemy had quitted; In this hasty Progress, some of his Ships, falling upon the shelves, he was constrained to burn; shortly after, recruited with the Forces of Count William (being twelve Ensigns) he entred the Wael, and united the Island, and the main Land, together with a Bridge. The Camp on both sides, was sorti∣fied against any Enemy that should come on their backs: The upper part of the Town, where the Walls were not lined with banks, he thought fit to batter, and because it seemed a great way to draw the Artillery, and incommodious withall, they were carried before the Town in the night, and by that meanes, the Defendants in Nimmeghen, for that in the dark they could not discern the quick motion of the Ships, spent all their Shot and Darts in vain.
At the same time, beyond the River, on the other Bank, there were other Military Engines to shoot into the Town At first, they resolved couragiously to defend the Town, and being not yet quite enclosed round, they sent to Verdugo, de∣siring him not to forsake them in that their extreme danger; for at this time, he was commanded to defend Gelderland,  had no forces, so that he might not immeritedly complain have onely forsaken places under his charge. After this, be∣cause they feared their Fortifications might be defective, al hand, of all Sexes and Ages, were imployed to make a  Work more inwards. There is a Castle in this place,  not so much because it is impregnable by the Military is∣cipline of this Age, as for its being a Monument of ant greatness and prowess: The Townsmen attribute the glory of the Work to Julius Caesar, warring in these parts against Gaul. They tell us also, that the Catti built the City, who when of old they left their own Country, possessed this Island of the Rhine, and all the Neighbouring parts of Belgia. But it is evident to me in my search of old Authours, that here up∣peared no kind of City, either in the dayes of Caesar, or of Trajan, in whose Reign, Tacitus wrote in the Roman I∣rary, written by Antoninus; this Nimmeghen began first to peep up her Head at the Wael, and that Charlemayne built a Palace therein, the French Chronicles declare, assuring us with∣all, that by the Normans, it was utterly consumed with fire; but the Germans not long after growing prevalent, it became a free City, and was a great while the Selected Seat of those Emperours. Untill by the Articles of the Pope, it was torn from the German Empire, in the divisions thereof, when William Earl of Holland got his share, and want of money still produced new occasions, it was pawned to Oth, hn Earl of Gelderland, from which time, being by reason of its so near vicinity to the Province of Geldres annexed thereto, it hath increased in power, growing rich by the long enjoy∣ment of peace, and having brought forth many ingenious
man; But to return to the Siege. As soon as the Cannon and Grae, and other private Stratagems, by Mines and the like, had now made the danger alike in every place, being once more summoned, they were divided into factions. The G ns, and men in Power, boasted of the Kings Power, and that an Army was coming to their relief, both out of Frizeland and Flanders, there being no Reason, why Rene∣gadoes should have their revenge; But the common People gathering together with a sudden fury, broke into the Court, where after a long murmur, and humming noyse, at length,  burst forth into words to this effect, first setting forth their misery in the stopping up of the River, their wasted lands, their ruined Houses, and the approach of Famine. [Neither, saith he, is this the first time, that we have by a Siege been forced to yield to our fortune; It is now a Year and upwards,  we have here lived in a wretched condition among these dan∣gers, glad to sock any corner to hide our selves in for safety; and the continued Series of our miseries is thus much more increased, for that we have unworthily and treacherously violated all Cove∣nant: But we unworthy of any help, and neglected by our Lords, of whom we have merited better things have received a very Sig∣nall favour from the Enemy unless perhaps now, us if bound to suffer the extremity, we still wait for relief from them, who refu∣sed to help us while they might; or which is as vain, that we should think with our own strength, and three little Bands of Souldiers, to overthrow those mountainous Fortifications, and raise a Siege which is so strongly setled and maintained. We shall be left as Zu∣phen and Deventer; We have against all Reason, protracted the time beyond Hulste, and what hope have we? what Reward shall we receive of our obstinacy? Alas, wretches! nothing but to be conquered: Let us now at length shake off the Chains of a based and ingratefull Kingdom, while we receive him who now is reputed our Adversary, not as a powerfull foe, but a mercifull Conquerour. There is a sort of People, who alwayes wage War, that they may not be enslaved by others, yet never have any hope of
setling a Government among themselves; To these all Rivers  Seas are open, they sail to all places for Commerce; their  flourish as in the undisturbed enjoyment of a continuall Peace;  are not impoverished either by their Governours and Magist avarice or the rude licentiousness of Souldiers: while we pay  less Tributes for the upholding our slavery, than for the  of our Laws and Customs: Let us become free among Fr and in enjoying that happy Name of a Common-wealth, instead of being conquered we shall be equall Conquerours, and have ∣qual share both in Command and Government.] This Speech being ended, many of the People did threa∣ningly murmur the same things, so that they who at the be∣ginning were averse, now went away, as consenting either out of fear, or for that they believed what was spoken was  truth; And the Souldiery durst not resist, being well con∣tented, in regard of their inability, to have their lives saved; The City desired they might be permitted the use of the Ro∣man Catholick Religion, but it would not be granted: As son as it was delivered, Prince Maurice sent in a Garrison, and appointed a new Magistrate, and this privilege he took  himself, during the War, abrogating the power of incor∣rupted Fraternities, as the onely nurse of Sedition, for  the Neighbouring Towns were ruled by a Senate, unless th for the dispatch of more weighty Affaires, some were by chance elected from among the People: Thus enjoying the greatest part of Gelderland, he restored the antient splendor of his Family, for that formerly, the Princes of the Name and Blood of Nassau had governed that Province. The Siege of Steenwic was thought fit to be deferred, be∣cause the Winter was now come, very hurtfull, by the Frost and Ice, to marches and obnoxious to carriages, nor would it have been any thing better, if it should either rain or snow, because the natural moysture and marishness of the ground would be exceedingly increased; wherefore the Prince re∣turning Victor into Holland, loaden with honourable fame,
even among forraign Nations, he was received by the , even with an excess of joy. The people of old were wont to rejoyce at their Princes good fortune, as from Command, not obliged by duty. They had known the former Prince of Aurang onely in disguise, under the Cloud of adverse fortune. And in the Earl of Lei∣cester's time, they were perplexed between private discords, and publick murthers: Now only they saw their bounds en∣larged by Arms, and their Government setled by Rivers, and strengthned with fortifyed Towns, and yet their Leader re∣quiring no other satisfaction for all his pains and labour, than the glory thereof, the benefit of the success being wholly left to the Country; which looked not only with hope. ut ad∣tion at his youth, as if it had been on purpose, set apart by the divine Providence, for such weighty undertakings. And then again, casting their unsatisfied eyes upon his countenance, they gratefully reverenced that tender Age, and  Blood, which had so often thrown it self upon dangers for their defence. And without all doubt, the Princes good fortune was much forwarded by celerity; besides, he had learned the exquisite Arts of Fortification, both as to the of sensive and defensive part, the besieging or defending Towns, and as far as the present Age was able to instruct him, was well practised in the encamping of an Army. The Enemies were nothing so industrious, their confi∣dence (as it is generally observed) breeding carelesness and slouth, and sometimes overweening Temeriy. They who are weakest in power, are for the most part strongest in Coun∣sel, as ayming to supply by prudent Resolutions and Indu∣stry, what is deficient in strength. Fame also is a great assi∣stant, where the first happy events are multiplyed to the great supportation of liberty. But the mayn of all, was the strength of Shipping among so many Rivers, without which the rest would have profited but little.
According to Custom, the Souldiers wintered in Garri∣sons, from whence many times, small parties going out wih various success, brought in booty, or were circumvented by the Enemy. During which times also, stratagems were fre∣quently used for getting of Towns; such were they, where∣by here Gertruydenburg, Maestrict, and Scluys, were offered at; and in another part, Breda was endeavoured to be taken but the Ambushy being discovered, the Armies marched back, frustrate of their designs. Now was the Sea scowned from Pyrates, and the Duke of Parma being for France, re∣ceived joyfully an Embassie sent from the Emperour, to m and mediate a Peace: But the United Provinces, suspected it,1592. as they had reason; but chiefly, be∣cause they had intercepted Letters from the King of Spain, written concerning it: wherefore they shut their e against those old deceits, warned by the fresh example of the Arragonians, who, while they unwarily discoursed of li∣berty, were surprised by craft, and drawn into slavery and ruine. These People of Spain, of old called Tarraconia, now ∣garly Arragon, first getting possession of that part of the Country by Arms, which barbarous Nations, from the other side of the Sea, had invaded, by the Counsel of such as we esteemed wise among them, erected a Commonwealth; At the beginning, Kings (that name and honour being given to a li∣mited power) were chosen here by the suffrages of the people, afterwards by the Custom of several Nations, their Heirs were admitted by Succession to the Government, yet obliging them to the observance of the Law, whereby they who were then eminent, as foreseeing the inconveniencies of a Kingdom, conveyed some power to the people whose Au∣thority was to be used in publick Counsels, and gave a privi∣ledge of Supreme Magistracy, even over the Kings them∣selves, and these boundaries were well observed, as long as the Princes were careful to do Right and Justice, and made
use of no Forces to defend Crimes. But afterwards there hap∣pening a Conjunction of Kingdoms, and all Spain, by that means, becoming subject to King Philip, all mens patience was tryed by the severity of the Inquisition, and every thing by new forms of Judgment was disposed, and they rather fit∣ted to the pleasure of the Court and Courtiers, then squared by the Rule of the antient Law, or Prescript order of Justice. The Case of Anthony Perez was greatly commiserated by the People, who having been employed by King Philip, about Eovedo's death, was yet by him falsly accused of but an ordinary fault, for which deprived of all Authority, and fly∣ing from Castile, he was yet prosecuted by the Kings rage, in∣to this Region, for the King hated him, because he had been active as a procurer in matters of Love. And when he In∣struments of wrath, impudently opposed the Laws, and would by no means suffer Justice, they were resisted by force, and the first commotions being provoked by force, were after∣wards nourished by gentle endeavours and dissimulation; And as the Tumults begun under a malevolent constellation, so the City was perswaded under pretence of the French War, to suffer the Kings Army to come through its Borders, and to march through Sarragosa, the Metropolis of that Region, and so to go over the Pyrenean Mountains: But instead thereof, the Nobles were murthered, and every one, that ei∣ther with Tongue or hand, had been forward to advance li∣berty was by revenge marked and for the future, nothing re∣mained, but a prospect of Tyranny and slavery. Although these things are not suitable to my purpose, yet I have not neglected to insert them here, at such times as they happened, that Posterity may compare their fortune, and the Netherlanders together, that as well the faults of Princes may be known, as the People may be instructed, that many times the cause is no less to be minded, than the Forces of a King. While these Transactions were a foot otherwhere, the
King of France being recruited with German Souldiers, and English Auxiliaries, besieged Roan, Queen Elizabeth desi∣ring that he would inclose the Enemy between the River Seine, and the British Ocean: this made the French Confe∣derates with Parma, take his long stay the worse, who being slow in making ready his Warlike preparations, or else con∣sulting of some higher design, how to augment the dangers, at last, though late in the year, having first received the Town of Fer in pledge, he drew near to the Borders of Nor∣mandy; There were in his Army several new raised men, and those Regiments which had lately fallen into a mutiny, but now were restored to their Colours, being full of booty, and having also received their pay, which the Duke of Parma very hardly extorted by the encrease of Tributes, and selling the right of Commerce to the Enemies, the Netherlanders not without cause complaining, that their Borders were left na∣ked, and their mony and strongest men carryed away to help strangers. Pope Gregory sent also Assistance to the French Rebels,  thing not used by his Predecessors, terrifying also their foes with cursings and threats, such as might have frighted a for∣mer Age; but such as either feared damage, or loved profit, forbore to meddle; and such as really intended help, were soon taken off by old age. It is manifest, that Sixtus, with∣holden by envy to the Spaniard, and rather than he would augment his Wealth, inclined to the French King, and this many suspected to be a cause of hastning his death. Against the plague of this concuring War, the United States rigged a Fleet, and sent to the King for a Guard, of the very lower of all their Regiments, ten Ensigns of Scott, and the like number of Netherlanders, under the Command of Philip Nassau: But when the Duke of Parma (for now he mustered his Army) long delayed his March. King Henry dismissed for the Winter, most of the Nobility that were faithful to him, and the only support of his necessitated War,
that he might have them the more ready another time; They were scarce departed, when the King hearing of the Ene∣mies approach to assault him, was compelled to draw his Forces together, and by that means, the Siege was raised. But when the entrance of the Spring had brought him a Recruit of Horse he pressed upon the Enemy, and forcing him beyond the River, pinched him with Famine, for he was impatient of any longer delay, and ready to decide the cause by Bat∣tel, if the Duke of Parma silently repassing the River, had not marched towards Paris. Wherefore the King leaving Ron, and taking some other Ports on that Coast into his power, and fortifying them where they wanted, he brought to passe, that thereafter he could not be hindred of any assistance coming to him by Sea. In this Interim, there were some light skir∣mishes, famous only in this, that in one the King was woun∣ded, and in another, the Duke of Parma, which wound trou∣bled him moe than his old Disease, for cure whereof, he had gone to the Spaw: And now wearied with France, about the latter end of Summer, he brings his ragged Regiments through Vermandois, the nearest way to the Netherlands. At this time, the English, while the Spaniards passed back∣wards and forwards in America and other places, very much annoyed them, both the Wind and the Sea conspiring against them, to deliver them up as a publick Enemy. And whils they have spoiled one another, the tempestuous Sea spared neither. And now also, that anniversary plague of mutinous parties returned into the Netherlands, and that with the more vio∣lence, because the Mutineers not only wanted their pay, but were pinched with the miseries of Winter. Some that were quartered about the Cities of Colen grew very outragious, as looking upon Germany, as able to yield them booty enough; But such as remained about Leige, and the Country near thereto, after they had by a long stay wasted all the Country about, part ran away to other parts, but most of them perish∣ed
either by poverty or Diseases; and if any yet continued healthy, they were so accustomed to discord, that they would range far and wide to wast and destroy; and by this meanes, more was to be maintained, yet there were fewer to defend it. But the Land, under the United States, was more restrain∣ed, having for defence in most places, Rivers running round about it, and the Sea securing another part. Besides the va∣lour and vertue of the Citizens was well known, that they who were raised in the inner part of the Country, would help to defend the furthest parts thereof, and be faithful Sup∣plies to the Regiments abroad. Hence it was, that there was a desire to go out with some part of the present Forces, while the Duke of Parma was not yet returned; and if they had made hast, without doubt, many of his men wearied with Travel, and worn out with Battels, and then also coming from a strange Country in the Winter, would not have been able to have encountred half the number of their Enemies. But laying aside talk, they began to think of action. Holland in∣sisted upon the Siege of Gertruydenburg. But the Frizons were preferred before all, that the prosperous beginnings of the last year might be perfected in this, themselves also offering their own Souldiers, of whom they never need to fear a scar∣city, if there be a War continued for any time: And indeed, these were the main strength of the Union, as long as the other Regiments attended the War in France. About this time, some Letters written by the Groningers, to Count Mansfeldt, were intercepted, which declared the necessity of their condition, and how want of all things grew upon them: Moreover, they sent some selected Deputies to the Emperour, to tell him, they had not fled to the greatness of the House of Austria, when they were free, that now they should be left undefended to the Government of Deputies, and laid open to the injuries of their Enemies: should they never be so happy, as to see their General and his Army, at least for example sake, that no people might seem to have fol∣lowed
the fortune of that great House, without Reason, or unadvisedly? Which complaints being sent into Spain, pro∣duced yet no other effect, than Exhortations to fidelity, and great promises, that an Army should come, and cut open their passages with the Sword. One Regiment was added for defence of those places held beyond the Rhine. And while Verdugo endeavours by all means to encrease his Forces, Her∣man Count Heremberg, daring nothing further, infested only the lesser Fortifications about Issell, from whence the Inha∣bitants took an occasion to contract, that they would under∣go the sudden brunt of both sides, and that they should enjoy by the levelling of the Castles, a common possession of their Lands, untill both Armies had decided their quarrel by a pitched Battel in the Field. At this time, as it were on pur∣pose to hinder Prince Maurice his March, the newes of the Ʋtrecht Factions came to his Ears, for that unquiet City had not yet forgotten those differences in Religion, which were begun in the Earl of Leicesters time: And Zeland lying far from the reach or defence of his Sword, began to deny the payment of their Taxes and Assesments; but these being all by him easily and with speed composed, in that same Spring he marched out, not with any new raised Bands, but for his supply and recruit, he had sent Orders to several Captains: And thus he did muster of Hollanders and Frizons, eight thou∣sand Foot very near, and five hundred Horse, and of Artil∣lery, greater and less, fifty. As soon as they were come to the utmost Border of Over-Issell, which looks towards Frizeland, the Walls of Steenwic were in sight, the greatness of whose strength & Fortification, as well as the fame of the Town, took up all their thoughts: And some of the States being of late terrified therewith, as also divers forreign Princes, judged it a very rash undertaking; for they remembred, that this was the place from whence they had driven Renneberg, after a Siege of three months, nor had he then a less Army, nor wanted any defences, that were
found necessary, either by custom or fear; for the Spaniard after he had taken it by stratagem, supposing that Frizeland would thereby be as it were shut up, and that the Zuydare might be sufficiently molested with Ships, added to the mo∣dern fortification, what ever might be advantagious against all those violences, whereof the Wars of former Ages w ignorant. On that side which looks towards the Sea, was only a low marshy ground, scarcely bearing any to wa thereon, much less fit for the drawing of Carriages with great Guns, or serviceable to raise Batteries: wherefore this ground being lightly thrown up, did rather inclose, this strengthen the Town on that side. Another part was encompassed with a Rampire made of a stiff Clay, intermingled and made strong with Timber-logs, piled one upon another, so that it was consolidated without any possibility, almost of divulsion. There were two great Forts, and between these two little ones, excellently raised by Art, so that on every part they flanked the Assaylants; and besides thee there was a Gallery for the Defendants, and at the bottom of the Fortifications, to stop all that should come to scale, there was a continued rank of Palisadoes: from hence the Trench began, a hundred foot in bredth, whereinto wa∣ter was drawn to fill it with a Mill, from a small River, which cometh out of Drente, and being a little shallower than the Trench, passes thence to the Blocksile Port, it falls into the Zuyderzee. Beyond the Trench, there is another Work, or Counter∣mure, kept by continual Guards day and night, and is fit to make Sallies, being moderately hollow and bending; for the other Bulwarks that lay further off, and divided from the Town, they were taken without any difficuly. The Besieged were sufficiently supplyed with two things, to wit, number of men, and obstinacy, for the Town (which is not very large) had in it, a thousand well Armed Foot, and six hun∣dred Horse, who all resolved to suffer the greatest extremi∣ties
imaginable, rather than render the Garrison: He who was Governour, named Anthonio Cquelle, had bound them all by Oath, that they should thereafter, never fear for any necessity that should follow: Neither were they more con∣firmed by their own strength, and the hope of timely Relief, tha by their Enemies small number; And some of them, out of their own proper sence of their crimes, committed at Gertruydenberg, by the desperation of life, contemned death. The difficulty of the Enterprize, very much incited Prince William, as well with the hope of Honour and prayse, at the present, as of terrour and dread for the future: The Leaguer was well fortified, wherein there was not only an abundance of Victuals, but the same was very cheap: Then the passage was cut off by many turnings, by which means, the Souldier went as it were, under coverture, and defended against the Shot of the Town; Sometimes the Besieged made Sallies, and not altogether without success, while for the most part, they found the Besiegers either drunk, unarmed, or half asleep; but this did not happen very often, because the infinite da∣mage of the besieged Souldiers, and the State of Affairs in the Town, could not be learned by any fear or threats, no not from such as were taken Captive. Daily did the Besieged calumniate and rail against both the Prince and his Army, al∣though on both sides the Cannon, with perpetual Thunder, spoke even sufficient hatred, and a new Bulwark, whose hilly rising twenty foot high, and more, threatned some great dan∣ger to the Town, this new Work, at the very top of it, con∣tained in length, threescore foot, and in bredth, fifty foot, from whence they could shoot into the very innermost parts of the Town: yet for all this, and the loss of so many of their men, they were nothing moved, among whom was slain Lewis, Brother to Count Herembergh. At this time, the Be∣siegers erected a great Tower of Wood, after the manner of Antiquity, to drive away the Defendants from their Stations,
and to overlook their Works, this the Besieged, finding he could not reach the heighth thereof with their other Engines, endeavoured to break it with their great Bullets: The Prince, when he perceived the terrible noyse of his Shot to be a vain, though with great cost and labour, and that the Besieges were rather encouraged to see their Town thus vainly at∣tempted, least the intervenient places should be possessed, he falls to other devises, as where the Land was more solid, and would endure Mining, he commands thither Pioneers, with Matrocks and other Instruments for digging, and orders them to undermine the place. And so the outward Work be∣ing pierced (though the Cannon could not hurt it) they were now come to the Trench, which they filled up with Faggots and Bavins: the Besieged all this while, mocking at the Princes Souldiers that would submit to such terrible labours. Then what could not privily be wrought further, the great Guns, brought through the Mines and Galleries, easily laid flat. And now the very Rampires that encompassed the Town came to be Mined, when a suddain Infection dissolved all the Defendants Courages, and involved them in such a Pannick Terrour, that they knew not what to shun, nor what to defend. They were chiefly disanimated by the want of Gunpowder, of which having by Letters before complained to Count Mansfeldt, they had not received any Answer, for that he himself daily expected Forces, and they looked for Money, and that was not to be had till the Duke of Parma's Return: Hereupon a Treaty is desired, and accordingly Commissioners admitted and heard. The Prince required all Renegado's to be deliver'd to him, that they might be punish'd according to their deserts, and that the rest should take an Oath, that for six Moneths they would not take up Arms be∣yond the Rhine. And this was to them an Example o Testi∣mony of his power. But the Commissioners, looking upon themselves as yet in a Conquerour's power, whereby they should be forced to submit to such hard Laws, go away full
of Contumacy and Malice; as if they had resolved, since they could not freely live, that they would fairly die: But some believed, that this Treaty was set a foot without any ne∣cessity, that the Besieged might not be aware of the ap∣proaching Relief, which Verdugo the next Night following sent to them, to the number of Three Hundred Men, two hundred having a little before gotten to them over the Mar∣shes: But Prince Maurice, having pre-instructed his Men in what he designed to do privately, shews his Army in Bat∣tel-Array, as if about to storm, they had been brought to the place; appointed for them; and that he might draw the Be∣sieged into an ambiguous fear to their Ruine, he had hidden in two places the famousest Engine of War now used, of whose use, the Antients were utterly ignorant; but our Age, abounding more with Malice and Cunning, have found it out. It is thus made: Coals mixed with Sulphur and Salt-Peter, very much dryed, if you put fire thereto, will swell exceedingly, and cannot be inclosed, but will force its way through all Obstacles, Guns, and other Military Instru∣ments filled herewith, by the force thereof throw Gads and pieces of Iron and Bullets to a very great distance; and if it be laid into the Ground, and cover'd with Earth, it will throw far and wide abroad all that lyes upon or near it. We call it commonly Gun-powder: Several great Vessels fill'd herewith were placed in the Mines; which Vessels being bound about with Match of a great length, upon the Enemies approach to the Mine, being lighted with like powder, car∣ryes the fire to all the rest, which in the bursting, maketh a dreadful Noise, carrying up into the Air, in a thick Cloud of Smoke, intermingled with Fire, all about it, and upon a sud∣dain, overthrowing all the Works, with the certain Ruine of all persons stnding in defence of the same: But many of the Enemy, fearing such a danger, in time stood off; yet at the springing of that Mine, Bodies of Men might have been seen hovering piece-meal in the Air, the torn and divided
Members, yet retaining their decaying vigour and mode, and, instead of Darts, proved Instruments of Death to other. But the other Mine, having cast down a part of the R∣pire, and the Mouth not being well closed, or else for that the old Foundation of the Work reverberated the Force, the main operative strength of the Powder flew backward, where∣by divers of them that went before the Banners, were either by the fall, or flying of the Earth, thrown up into the Air, or buried in an untimely Grave; Some also not escaping the very fire: And now the Army began to prepare to scale the Walls; and another Company thereof endeavour'd to break the Bars and Fastnings of the Gates, when Prince Maurice coming a little too near to take a view, was wounded by; Bullet shot from the Town, which News presently ran from hand to hand, yet he nothing changed therewith, staid and maintained his Commands, and gave Orders to his Captains as he was wont at other times: But in the hinder part of the Army, the Report thereof was made much worse, insomuch that the Army began to be amazed at it, every one feigning to himself as present, the Evil which he most feared: Where∣fore the Assault being for a while forbidden, least the danger falsly believed, might open an occasion to further damage re∣ally; and because also, many of the Souldiers were wounded, and the inner parts of the Town were not sufficiently disco∣vered, though the Wooden Tower before-mention'd, were gotten very near: But the Rage of the Souldiery scarcely began to be appeased, when upon another view of the Town the difficulty of the Assault appeared: However, the Be∣siegers possessed all the ruinous places, which the Mines had made, and turned into heaps, placing thereon their Ensigns; but the Remainders of the Bulwarks were yet defended, which Prince Maurice labour'd also to undermine, and there∣upon to give an Assault: In this interim, the Besieged had drawn a Trench about the Market-place, not that they hoped thereby to save the place, but onely by such delays to work
for themselves an opportunity to obtain Articles. They saw Artillery brought thither, and knew there was little help or safety in that Entrenchment, but that the same would rather be a Defence to their Enemies, and that if they should joyn in Fight, they being the fewer in number, must needs perish. Thus being subdued in all ways, before their Resolutions stooped, they obtained Articles that were neither hard nor dishonourable: Particular care being taken for one Samarin his safety, who was a Noble Person among the Jesuits; and for the granting of these Articles, the Authors thereof were they of the Senate, that were present with Prince Maurice, and of his Council; who considering the necessity of the time, for they understood that Mondragonio was mustering the Spanish Army, rather chose, that the Souldiers Minds should be in∣flamed with a gotten Victory, then held any longer in su∣spence; and whoever offer'd injury to the Souldiers, as they marched out, was severely punish'd. There went six hun∣dred intire, beside two hundred sick and wounded; so that by various kinds of death, near five hundred perish'd. Above twenty days were spent in repairing the Works about Steene∣wi, and various Debates in Council, while the Hollanders, and such as lived at distance from the War, adjudged they had won honour enough, and would not have the now wearied Army go to stir up, or meet any fresh Dangers: But indeed, being privately afraid, least the Frizons, together with their Fear, should also cast off their Obligations, and refuse to bear a share in the Burthen of the War. At this time, there fell out another Impediment unexpe∣cted; for Queen Elizabeth recall'd all her Souldiers, to drive the Spaniards from the Coasts of Bretaign in France, not without upbraiding the States, concerning those Auxi∣liaries they sent the French King, without her Knowledge or Counsel. Notwithstanding all which hindrances, yet all they that lived beyond the Rhine, as also the desire of continuing their Honour, moved them to attaque Coevorden, a Town and
Castle seated so, as not easily to be approached, and for that famous for many Ages. In the Wars of our Ancestors, and even in this among our selves, every one as he possessed the Country, beyond or more inward, either lessned or increased the Works: At last, the Spaniards fortified throughly; to be as a Defensive Bulwark, both to Drente and Groengen, and likewise to secure a Passage into Germany; Five great For stood out beyond the Rampires, and there were little Moes raised for advancing the Cannon; the Trench was an hun∣dred Foot wide, and fenced before with Pallisado's; and that which added strength to all these was, the nature of the place it self; for upon the two sides thereof, to wit, between the Zuyderzee, and the Bay of Dullart, in which space is comprehended Frizeland, Drente, the Territory of Gro∣gen, and part of Over-Issel; the one among the Marishes, and lyes between that and a little Bay, whereby the Country people used to send over their Oxen and Cows into B∣theime, a little County in Germany; and from thence, at first, was the Original of Coevorden. This therefore being taken, both Groening might be quite closed up, there being no other coming thither, than what was Artificial, and also the whole County of Frizeland might be freed from the Incursions of the Enemy. The whole Face of the Country is very plain and exceed∣ing Moory, and full of Mud, which is never hard or dry e∣nough to bear any Weight by the greatest heat of Summer, or violentest burning of the Dog-Star: For the securing of Provisions, because the Bounds of the United Provinces were as yet far distant, and there was no River, but onely a little Ri∣vulet which runs by Coevorden like a Trench, it pleased the Prince to Garrison Otmarsen. This Town lyes in the ex∣treamest part of the Country of the Tubantes; whither the Prince being come with part of his Army, while the Camp and Leaguer were Fortifying, he drove away the Spaniards with his Guns, whose Horse, rather than they would be Be∣sieged
there, broke through the middle of the Enemies. Here was kill'd by the Enemies shot Charles Levinus Famarsh, who having, for a long time, taken the part of the Confederate Nobility, at this time was General of the Ordnance, a Man excellently skill'd, as well in the understanding and manage∣ment of doubtful and difficult Affairs, as the most pro∣sperous. Now was a very handsom Sally made out of Coevorden, wherein many were slain, whose Bodies the Besieged desi∣ring, that they might have Christian Burial, they were deli∣ver'd to them: Frederick Count Heremberg, with six hun∣dred Souldiers, part of whom were sent to him through the Marshes, defended the Castle, but he burned the Town, least it should defend the Enemy, in their Battery and breaking down of the Walls, or else should be burdensom to him to keep: yet he seemed to maintain the Ground-plat thereof, though onely out of design to protract time; untill the Prince by digging entred it, and beat out those who stayed to fight in defence thereof, and then raising a Mount, he plant∣ed his Cannon for battery. The Works which were without the Trench round about the Castle, being over-hasty deserted, the Besieged them∣selves, voluntarily set on fire the Bridge: And now as soon as they were gotten to the Trench, the Prince received In∣telligence, what plenty of all things the Besieged had, onely they had but one Well of water to drink off, so that in the night, they were forced to come to the Trench for water, the same environing the Castle with a very great deepness: This he found might be dryed up with Engines, and likewise the Springs of the Well be stopped, or at least intercepted. But at the beginning of the work, it appeared, that there was an encrease of Water under the ground, through continual bub∣ling Springs, which according to the nature of that Element, will follow, whithersoever the Workman can design to draw it; Not was it long, before divers falling shoures yielded
comfort to the Thirsty Besieged, and put a stop to  But the French, which was fed by certain little C brought from the Marishes, was drawn dry and fill'd; and  more safe passage, had placed thereon Devices, made of ∣ber and Hurdles, so that the Souldiers might come safely  the very Walls; the Flanks and Fronts of the Builders  secured, either by the darkness of the Night, or a Line  beyond them: Between which Coverts, great Posts  indifferent distance being fixed, were cover'd with Pl and Earth cast thereupon, to prevent the Enemies shot,  preserve them against fire: Being thus conveyed, they ∣dermined the Rampire at the very Bottom; but the Can∣non, from more convenient places, had beaten down all the Curtain, and driven away the Defendants. While these things were doing here, Mondragonia, in the mean while, furnish'd divers little Castles and Forts in the Country of Brabant; by the taking and forcing of which, the Hollanders, for some years past, had fetched thence, a well great Booty, as exacted Tributes: This was his  Care, while the main strength of the Government beyond th Rhine, was by the hands of Assailants and Defendants eve almost destroyed. But as soon as the Duke of Parma re∣turned from France, Verdugo was very earnest with him, to carry his Army that way: But the Souldier was over-∣ryed with Travail, and besides required, before he would stir any more, the Pay that was due and in Arrear: Yet neverthe∣less he obtained, that Ten Thousand Foot, should be drawn together from sundry parts, and 7 Cornets of Horse should be deliver'd to him, to undertake that Journey, and if he saw convenient to fight the Enemy; besides, he was to be Re∣cruited with Three Thousand more out of the Garrisons be∣yond the Rhine. Prince Maurice receiving Intelligence of these preparati∣ons, in regard the compass of the Leaguer was greater than he could safely make good against the Besieged, and withall
defend himself from an External Force that might come at his ack; he therefore began new Works more inward, lea∣ving and dismantling the former: There came also to him out  the Regiment of Collonel Stolberg, as a Supply for these Souldiers, which the prosperous, though not unbloudy S of Snic, had consumed and wearied: The English Regiments also returned, and the Hollander's Auxiliaries which had been in the French Service; Count Philip of Nas∣sau being order'd to bestow the wearied men into Garrisons,  to draw out in their stead such as were fresh, with which he should defend Gravewaert, the Watch Tower for the Vr, and turn towards the Enemy, if by chance he should chfe the Isle of Holland, or either of the Coasts adjoyning, or near thereto, for the Seat of the War, and to follow him whi∣thersoever he went: Also, Frederick Count Heremberg, either from Intelligence, or Conjecture, had conceived to him aforehand, the hope of Relief that would suddainly come to him; and therefore being required to deliver up the Castle, he answer'd, That they must stay yet some Moneths first. A few ts before, the English Regiments, and the other Forces un∣der Count Philip of Nassau, did arrive at the Camp or Lea∣gue; Verdugo having got past the Rhine, by taking a long Circuit as far as Berck, had pitched not far from Prince Maurice, at a place called Emlichem, prying with all dili∣gence into the scite and manner of the Prince's Camp; and not onely with his Eyes, but by the Treachery of a Noble Person, with whom the Prince, at that time, was very fami∣liar; whose fault also the Prince afterwards pardon'd, though it were manifestly proved: The Enemy had conceiv'd a hope of straitning the Prince's Army of Victuals, but when they knew there were two ways to supply him, and that the Marishes lay between them; and because his Forces were not enough numerous to be divided, he resolved to try the strength of his Weapons and Men in an intire Body.
Now were Fires seen frequently, whereby he admonish'd, the Besieged, that they should not be wanting to his Design, being altogether ignorant, that they could not sally, because their Bridge was broken down: But Night drawing on a∣pace, the Spaniards, notwithstanding the delay in their pas∣sage from the Bridge, over the River Vecht, assault the oue Camp, where the Prince had placed Stolberg with his Regi∣ment, and a strong party of Horse, in a place very convenient, for as well in regard of the Trees as the Waters. The Ene∣my had chosen to assault this place, because they guessed the Horse-Guards would not be over-diligent in their Watch▪ and the new Regiment was hoped to be unskill'd in all things belonging to War; and thereupon they began to creep o the Trenches in every part, to attempt to scale the Rampire, and successively climbed up one in the Foot-steps of ano∣ther. But the Nassauians, although they suspected that Night, as if with the light security returned to them went to sleep, till they were suddainly awaked with the noise of their Enemies Voices, at a distance, threatning errour, and crying out, that the Camp was taken: Nor could the Battel be discover'd, either by hastning thither, or the place: They who were unready, or half asleep, catching up presently such Weapons as came next to hand, by chance made a stand at the doors of their little Huts, while the Horse fought with the Enemies Foot: Certainly, this danger was averted, chiefly by the Valour of the Commanders, who gather'd together from the innermost Tents, the most couragious Souldiers, to make strong Defence; Above the rest, Coun. William of Nassau▪ who was the more careful in this regard, for that he contrary to the Opinions of many, had perswaded the beginning of this Siege, bringing out beyond the Camp, as many Horse as he could get together, fell in upon the Enemies Flank: Al they that entred the Camp were slain; and they that follow▪ them were stopped and driven back; and by this time, the
clear Day light appearing, turned the Invention of their di∣stinguishable Mark against themselves; for being thereby certainly known, they were as certainly slain: But they who were without, stood round about the Camp in a Ring, as if they were yet ready, or resolved to take the same, puft up indeed with a vain Confidence, because they had been used to Conquer, and for fifteen years together had onely seen the Backs of their Adversaries, or their places of abode. But now the whole Army of the United States being together in Arms, easily beat off the rash Assailants, sometimes in one place, sometimes in another; yet for all their Repulse, they retreated in good order, not betaking themselves to flight, though they were most cruelly gall'd by the Cannon, which was a great means of their future safety, after such a bloudy Bcketing: And Prince Maurice, contenting himself pru∣dently to have won the Victory, commanded his men not to pursue the Spaniards in their Retreat. In the Camp, (a strange and incredible thing to be fore-told) onely two or three were kill'd, but many were wounded, among whom was Count William the Governour of Frizeland; Many days afterwards, the Spaniard vauntingly drawing his men into Battalia, challeng as it were into the field, the other Army, who were not over-hasty to run into danger, as being ruled by more sound Advice. And now was the hope of the Be∣sieged turned into fear, when they saw their Companions beaten off from those Works, where they had at first gained; and the rather too, because the Top of the Fortress, that was to be seen above the Rampire, was overthrown, and another which the Besiegers had substituted, was endanger'd by the Pioneers. Hereupon, the other Officers and Souldiers also earnestly perswaded Frederick to surrender, who was very unwilling thereto, blaming him further, as not understanding the danger they were in: They desired, that they might have leave to consult with Verdugo, but that would not be grant∣ed.
But the Princes granted the rest of their Desires the more readily, because the moist Temperature of the Heaven, and inclination of the Air to Rain, would cause a difficulty, in bringing Provisions to himself, and his own Army. Thus was Coevorden surrendred, and committed by the Prince to the keeping of the Prizons, though they of Over-Issel denied their consent to the same; maintaining, that as well the Castle, as the whole Region belonged to them, and they of Drete af∣firming to be part of their Jurisdiction, and never to have belonged by any Antiquity to them of Over-Issel, unless that they might not transmit their Enemy through their Bor∣ders. The Armies were not yet departed from one another, but lay idle, out of a mutual fear; the States gave theirs to the King of France, for that the Burden of the War lay more hea∣vy upon him: Shortly after, when Autumn had made an end of all those that were ill before, by choaking them up with Rheums and Catarrhs, the Duke of Parma, though much in∣disposed as to bodily health, yet undertakes a new Journey into France, that he being present with an Army, might mo∣derate and sway the Parliaments of that Kingdom, which the Companions and Allies of the Spaniards had summon'd to meet the next Year: But his strength failed him, not being able to undergo so great Toil, in the Borders of Artois; where, either by the increasing of his Disease, or (as some suppo∣sed) by poyson, he ended his Life: For some who pleas'd themselves with the worst of Rumour, stuck not to believe so. This time of his death, agreed with the coming of Fu∣ain to King Philip; who, hearing by accident of the Duke of Parma's Infirmity, had commanded him, that is, Fontayn, to oversee the Netherlandish Affairs, that he might settle any neglect, caused by the Duke's sickness, and compose any Troubles arising by his Death. This Person was a man of a very harsh Nature, and privately hated by the Duke of Par∣ma;
And there were some, who, not long before, did fore-tell either the Duke's Death, or Restraint. The truth is, many Things began to be discover'd, that manifested the King to be suspitious of, if not highly displeased with him: For he alone was looked upon, to have hindred his Kinsman Far∣neze, from being Elected Pope; And of late had commanded, That the Duke should not take up any Money at Interest, unless by the Counsel and Consent of those, who were set up rather as Spies or Guardians, than Counsellors. His Physitians said his Disease proceeded from the hard swelling of the Spleen, and Hydropical Humour, between the Skin and the Flesh; of the growing of which Disease, it appears he was sensible, for that be abstain'd from Wine, and accustom'd himself to drink Water: and for avoiding the Gout, and other pains of the Joynts, he drank little of that too, or else it may be he was suspitious of Poyson: Most believe, that he had Poyson gi∣ven him more than once: But herein Authors very much differ. Thus dyed Alexander Farneze, even in the most flourish∣ing time of his Age, being but seven and forty years old, of which he had spent fourteen in the managery of this War: his last five years had much decayed his Reputation, nor in∣deed did he use the like diligence then as formerly▪ whether that after the business of Antwerp, as being glutted with Ho∣nour, he gave himself over to pleasures, or that being advi∣sed of Philips jealousie, he sought by sloath and stupidness, to procure a Remedy to allay the greatness of his fame; He was descended from a Family, as potent as antient, drawing his Originall and greatness from Pope Paul the third; At first, being a young man, under his Mothers tuition, he spent his time in the Low-Countries, without any honourable Em∣ployment, and was so contemned, that he was said to be of a heavy Spirit. There is scarce any man that can say, his pub∣like and open Judgments were ever dissembled; The first Warlike Honour he atchieved, was at the winning Navarre,
when he fought for the Spaniard, under the Binner of his Uncle Don John of Austria, against the Turk; Being made Commander in the Belgike War, he shewed how great he could be; In the quest of Honour, he was indefatigible, ease and courteous in his access, mercifull towards his Enemies and for as much as could ever be discerned by his outward appearance, faithfull to the King, and not to be corrupted against his own Honour, and the Peoples affection. He was very conformable to Counsel, but was tyed up more strictly than ordinary, to an Opinion once affirmed, and would not endure such as dissented. And then from the success of Af∣fairs, he took too much to himself; and that very thing rais∣ed him many Enemies, and caused much of His contrary for∣tune, which indeed he took gently, though, which is  more difficult, he bore his good fortune with a great Spirit. Some do observe, that for a long time he followed the advise and Instructions of Caspar Robless, a most ingenious and wise man. And that after his death, no one being prevk with him, among variety of Counsellors, differing in opinion he became unconstant, and wavering in his Resolutions, a that from thence his Fortune reculed from him. His maer of speech was Majestick, but withall, amiably pleasant. H Stature and other parts of his Body, but of a middle size, his Eye sharp and penetrating, the true Emblem of a watch disposition. The rest of his, was not his own naturally,  may be rather called the faults of the Court and the Age. The detractors of his fame, among whom Campigny was one, com∣manded lately by him to a recess in Burgundy, attributed i to the power of the Kings Forces, or the wants and disco of the Enemy: Both whose Conditions being changed,  also was the fortune of the War: On the other side; so wisely considering both, affirmed that there was no small dif∣ficulty, to govern with an equall hand, and keep in order many several Nations in one Army, some whereof, were a most insociable, repressing therein all Animosities, which ne∣vertheless,
broke out soon after his death, and so from time to time more bitterly. Even in the greatest extremities, he car∣ryed security in his presence, so that most of the Seditions of his time were begun in his absence. 'Tis true, many Towns were lost, but it was, when he was employed other-where, and as Fortune was pleased to wait on the Armies: But how great a part of them did he conquer? and certainly he could not resist the same Enemy afterwards, with any o∣ther Design, nor with naked Forces. Without doubt, all Dis∣cipline perish'd with him. His Funerals were celebrated even with the Tears of the Netherlanders, who wished such as would not grieve for him, the Reward of the Severity of for∣mer Governours. The Third BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1593.BY the Duke of Parma's Death, the Expedition in∣to France was broken off, and the Regiments stay∣ing upon the Borders, took some French Castles lying near them; and not long after, the Town of Nayon, the 16th day after it had been besieged, the French being first filled up, and the Works that were interposed, begun to be undermi∣ned. But the King of Spain was willing now to make a Peace, that he might the better employ his whole Endeavours a∣gainst the Low-Countrey-mens present good Fortune; and for the winning their good will, he confers greater Honours on those Noble-men, who, by their continued Obedience, were known faithful to him: Bestowing upon them the Command of several Provinces, and while one could be pitched upon
for the chief Regency, Peter Count Mansfeld obtain'd the Name of Governour, a man, as well in Age, as Experience▪ before others, being now in the Eightieth Year of his A▪ The Chief in the Council were Peter Herrique Count F∣tayn, and Stephen Ibarra, both Spaniards. This, in the Ag∣ment of Artois, formerly had consented, That the Publike Go∣vernment should be in the Citizens: But discovering the Fra he prevail'd for the Institution of a Council of War, that might by degrees, though not directly, draw all Things under th Care and Cognizance: That Council consisted for the  part of Spaniards; to whom, at this time, were added Fon∣tayn and Ibarra; who had Order, by Command, to moder the publike Charges, and to overlook the Treasury, which it was rumour'd in Spain that he had perform'd with fidelity: The cause of believing this might be, as it then hapned, the unexpected Charges of the War, though oftentimes under that pretence, are hidden all manner of Deceit and Polling; and the Mind being never throughly purged, but the stain still increasing, so that at last it becomes past all hope of Re∣medy. They said, who cast an Eye backward to those Things, that the States did more with Two Hundred Thousand ∣rens a Moneth, than was done on the King's behalf with nine hundred thousand, while Interest, superstuous Sallaries, and private Defraudations, scarce left the third part of the Re∣ceits, for the true intended purposes; That King Philip's For∣ces were sufficient both to Conquer the Netherlands, and to assist the French, if they were rightly look'd after, because his Father Charles the Fifth, with far less Wealth, had oftentimes maintained many great Armies, in several parts of the World. Therefore, that there might be setled in the new acquired Empire of the Provinces a greater Authority, or because the Regent should not be in fear, there were added several Regi∣ments, and Money sent thither in abundance; and this was no more than necessary, because the Sea-men, that were con∣tinually to Guard Antwerp, unless they had present satisfa∣ction,
would be ready to mutiny for their Pay, and threaten to behave themselves as Enemies. And the Garrisons of  and Berck were no less audacious than they: But the Spaniards who were newly come, as they were ignorant of many things, so they endeavour'd all they could, to repair what they saw amiss, that so they might creep into grace and favour. And, upon a certain day, Fontayn coming into the Senate, was the Author of a cruel Sentence; and calling that them, which was inforced by Necessity, he began to abolish all the Customs of War; for he said, That the Dispute had his been thus long maintained by the Wealth or Valour of the Hol∣landers; But that mean and inconsiderable people, and if they were looked upon with the Eye of Reason far unequal to the whole Netherlandes, did thrive and increase, not onely by the Spani∣ard's Treasure, but by their very Forces and Vices: That their own negligence and ignorance was the great hinderance of their own fortune, and that they fearfully wrought any Evil against a pub∣like Enemy: That the vast compass of Ground, among the Cities, under the King's power, do yield Tribute to the Enemy without danger; as if it were an easier matter to do an injury by Arms, than to repell it. Rather then so, let all the Inhabitants be forced to take up Arms and so by doing, and suffering all Acts of Hosti∣lity become liable to the same batred with the Souldiery, that they alone among all hazards, may not go free distributing their Affe∣ctions at their pleasure, but should behold the fortune of both Par∣ties in one anothers bloud: But if the Enemy could not be withstood in all places, yet certainly it were better, that the whole Country should lye wast, and be altogether uninhabited, than as it is now to lye open to the Enemies Invasion, and yield them Contribution, and other means of Treachery, to know all is done: That now all the Regiments were weakned and corrupted, as it were by a Contract of Sluggishness, while every one laying aside Arms, seeks by Obli∣gation of others to confirm his own safety. Hence it proceeds, that they are ready to flee at the thought of a Battel, and chuse rather the Trade of a City, than to indure the first shock of their Enemy.
The Romans, who were the perfect Exemplars of Military Disci∣plines, always took care, that no Souldier should have  Employment than that of his Arms: How oft it hath been  that even the stoutest Minds have been worn out of Courage  the hope of Safety, when on the other side, the most time ∣dants, have, by Desperation, become Valiant: The Souldier, ¦der his Colours, should be taught, that there is no third thing ¦tween Death and Victory, to be admitted among them:  Peace mix'd with War, is nothing else but a hindrance of p Peace, and a means to yield daily nourishment to War.] W words being deliver'd in a fierce Tone, drew many to  with him by his Authority, and the pretence of his well-b Counsel: On the other side, some few who had Experie of those things, and did mind the Duke of Alva's Seve how it was repressed; averred, That all things were not c¦venient at all times; that the Customs of this Age were far  for such a Discipline especially now when no man will take  Oath, unless he be allured thereto by Reward, and the easie s;e¦vice of the War; That such Rigour is not the way to Peac Concord; nor is the War with the Bordering Neighbours so ¦tal, that it must needs be managed with the utter Reine of  and Depopulation of the Country; but as in the frequent Differen∣ces of Neighbours and Companions, all hope of Reconciliation  to be thrown away; so in civil Discords, there is a moderation be used as being all under the pleasure of Fortune. Nor  the Rule both of Commanders and Souldiers be wanting, if  Dispute may be argued by Examples, who would never execute Severity of War upon any, but in the heat of Battel; And the ¦ring of Corn, releasing Captives without Ransome hath for a Ages made their Clemency adde a Lustre to their Fame a Prosperity. Discourses thus bandied pro and con, at last it hapned be as it doth too often in many Businesses, that the majo carryed from the better. And therefore, Count Ma
made it a Law, That all Prisoners taken in War, should be con∣demned to some corporall punishment, and so should all that assist∣ed the Enemy, by payment of Contribution. The United States, as they were necessitated, set forth an Edict to the same purpose, That within a certain time, this Cru∣elty of the Spaniards, with bitter Invectives, might be resented. And now the Villages and Fields were Forraged with wan∣dring Incursions; the Souldiers, so soon as taken, were hang∣ed, and many Examples of strange Fortune were shew'd up∣on all. First of all, the Priests and Nobility, intreat the Removal of this miserable Destruction from their Possessions, in re∣gard they could not always be provided, to resist a suddain violence upon their Fields, lying open to be invaded. But the Souldiery decreased, and such as remained, fearfully en∣deavoured by all means, to shun any meeting with the Ene∣my, if they could but hear one anothers Voices at a distance. Beside, they cryed out, That they sold their Lives but for a little Money▪ and yet could never have that when it was due; but whether they had or no, they were sure to be drawn out to fight, and must venture all manner of Wounds, and the Victory it self yielded them little advantage. If at any time, by the Averseness of Fortune, a Souldier sell into the Enemies hands, while he was suffering death by the Executioner's hand, he was laughed at, because he had not fled in time. The Captains and Tribunes, trembled in silence to think, that the more fortunate they had been, the greater was their hazard. These things made them admire Antiquity, in the Obe∣dience of the present Times, and at last made them return to their old Custom, to redeem their Lands with Tribute, to make Exchange of Prisoners; and that he who Ransom'd himself, should, for the same, give a Months Pay.
Which for the future was punctually observed, and if  one violated these priviledges, the same severity was  to him by the Enemy. Thus with an equall terrour, and punishments of some innocent persons, the Laws of  were re-established. In the Winter, some Horse, and a few Foot, under the Com∣mand of Philip of Nassau, were sent out to constrain ¦zenburg, and the outside skirts of the Netherlands to  Tribute, and they wanted but a little of winning the To of St. Vit, the fault of missing it, being wholly in the Sco who brought word, that on that side which they intended  fall upon, they had onely two Gates to hinder them▪ when as they found a third after the two other were beaten down. After they had continued abroad full fourteen dayes a ¦raging, the Enemies Garrisons all the while as occasion o¦fered, picquering with them, when either taking away,  burning whatever came in their way, they returned safe  their Quarters, and loaden with spoyl. The Condition o the Borders at this time, was most miserable, for a select ∣ty of Count Mansfeldts men, wasted and took away what¦ever the Nassavians had left; the noyse of the French W being also at the same time rumoured, which by triviall di∣cords, threw both Lorrain and Strasburg into a vast abys of mischiefs. Hence arose innumerable Complaints▪ but the got very little remedy or redress. As soon as the conveniency of the season permitted, the Hollanders being the chief of the Union, turned their mind from forreign business, to domestick cares. They concluded that without doubt, it was very necessary to take Gertruyde¦burg, for that one Town being torn from their Body,  much torment Holland: Therefore while it was yet Winter they hastned to prepare all things fit to that future intend least either the Enemy should prevent them, or the Friz should draw their Forces that way. But now the Fortifica∣tions, not so well proved of late in the former frustrated Siege
of the place, were defended by a stout number of Souldiers, to wit, fifteen Ensigns of Walloons and Germans, and the con∣tinued care of their Officers. And the Winterly Waters, and frequent shoures, had more than ordinary augmented the continual moysture of the Fields: Against all which, there as onely hope in celerity, while the flower of the Enemies Army was yet detained upon the Borders of France: The se out of Brabant, were commanded to environ the Town, and that their store might be diminished to stop all provisions going to them for succour. And forthwith the Prince, having prepared all things for for War, carried thi∣ther in Ships all his Foot-forces, which in truth, could not be called many, (for the Frizons had their own men, and Prince Maurice in vain desired Count William to come thither to him with ayd.) A great Lake lies before the Town, and washes indeed the greater part of it, spreading it self back∣ward from the mouth of the Maes, since the year one thou∣sand four hundred twenty and one, at which time, the Sea in a most impetuous manner, broke through all its boundaries, and drowned seventy and two Villages. This (they call it Merow, by one common name with the Channel of the Wael, and it is probable, that it first re∣ceived that name from some of the antient Kings of France) is washed on the right side by the River Dungen, springing out of the fields thereabout adjacent. The Land on the other side of the Bank, is in the Jurisdiction of Holland, although for that it is doubtful, the Brabander lay a claim to it. It is part of the possessions of Nassau, by right of pledge. The Prince of Aurange, after the Peace made at Gaunt, fortified it as an entry or inlet into Brabant. There were famous Pools that abounded with Fish, but now the Fish is almost all gone, being driven thence, either by Fords and shallow Sands continually encreasing, or else by the voyce and thunder of War about them, and the daily mischiefs done them by men. In the Bank, which contains the water (for
the rest onely hiding the water with a thin film of Earth, can∣not be wrought to any thing) are many turnings and coverts which lead to the Works of the Town, lying beyond the Trench. But the Northerly blasts of the Spring, by tempest upon the Lake, had broken down that part of the Bank, it being weakened before by digging: And again, the same way (for there remained no other) the Darts and Shot out, of the Castle, which the Enemy yet held on the neighbouring Bank of Dungen, infested all that attempted it; This was dif∣ficult in the access, but a kind of hurdles being made, and covered with Loam, were put there, that they might cover, and be as a Trench for such as should assault the place. And out of the Isle of Dungen, which is hard by, were made many Shot, and at the same time Count Hohenlo, least fresh men should be sent out of the Town to supply the Castle, invades the narrow and strait passage (a happy adventure) where∣upon it was surrendred. In these labours, and fortifying the Camp, almost a month was spent before Mansfeldt approached. He sent part of his Troops before to Turnehout, but Prince Maurice his Horse, voluntarily made an incursion upon them, while yet they were but coming together into a Body; for they being of no use among the Marshes, the Prince had quartered them in Town, so as they could well infest the Enemies marche. And Count Mansfeldts Son Charles, being safe returned from the Enemy, was in danger among his own men; for being called out of France, by hasty Messengers, where he had first taken Noyon, as is before mentioned, and afterwards Vallery, as he required a Centurion of a Spanish Band (being then in the Borders of Artoys) who had been found guilty of a Rape, to be brought forth to punishment, he scarcely escaped the fury and madness of the rest, himself being struck at with the Souldiers Weapons under his Command, they also casting off their Knapsacks, as if they had been going to fight: These tumultuary licentiousnesses, were customary in forreign pla∣ces
with them, in regard there was wages due to them for a s;e moneths. Mansfeldt being a German, and having a re∣gard to his own Honour, and his Fathers greatness (which be perceived envyed,) was much vexed, wherefore leaving them in the Town of St. Paul, which they had set upon and gotten, himself, with some trusty Regiments slipping away, castle to the Army and augmented its number, which the Commandes marched withll but very slowly, its own multitude hindering its speed. For having 12000 Foot, and about 3000 Horse, their Confidence was suh, that they be∣lieved immediately to over-run their Enemy, who was not all so strong as they, for Prince Maurice had not much a∣bove 5000. Wherefore from this action, Honour was to be gained to the new Governour, and they hoped from hence, is to purchase glory to the one, so to strike terrour into the other. Neither did any suspect the immense largeness of the Fields, in regard there were such incertain bogs, and so ma∣ny Moores scattered up and down among them, and they were so inclosed, that as the place yielded not room for the Armies to fight, so the Fords and shallowes afforded no place for stratagems or Ambuscadoes. Wherefore observing, I suppose, the face of the Siege, and in what manner the War was ma∣naged, he thought fit only to venture with a few, because the other part of the Camp did not merit the like fame, either in the danger or event; and truly this first example of his, was given with a very true consideration, in praising the po∣licy of the Antients, who ever made use of all things to the purpose, rather than for ostentation. The Prince had pitched his two Camps in several Fields that had easie ascents, that he himself might defend the left side of the River and other places near to the City towards the West, the other part towards the East, Hohenlo had the charge of; the whole Leaguer, every Regiment having his proper Station and Tents, between which
were the Ways and Markets, was like a City, and was on every side fortified with a strong incurvated Rampire, whee∣on were planted many Cannon: This could not be much weakned at a distance, and the Enemy could not come near to fight, without great hazard and damage. Near the Trench that ran before it, wherein there was a double Rowe of Pa∣lizadoes, headed with Iron, least the falling off of the Water should leave them bare; or, on the other side, by a too great increase, should overflow the Works: There were Seluces and Engines fitted on purpose, to let out the Water. Dungen being also fitted with two Bridges, by which means there was a very near way to the Camp, and a Cross-way being made over the Marishy places with Cawseys, where they were cover'd before with the Hurdles and Baskets, stuffed and cover'd with Mud and Loam; all that passed that way, were secured on one side: And then whatsoever part of the Fields had been more wet than was convenient, it soon be∣came firm, by the throwing in of Faggots, Bavins, and other like Stuff; and, if any where they were hindred by Estuaries, and the force of the Waters, were like either to throw down, or carry away the great Heaps cast therein, immediatly the Border of the Bank was fastned with great Stakes headed with Iron: So that the places were no more like themselves, but quite changed; the Marishes were made solid, and where the Enemy formerly was afraid to fall into a Quagmire, there were now firm Fields. All the Ground lying between the Camps, was encompassed round with a large Rampire and Trench, hardly to be walked in three hours: Here and there scatteringly were some Watch-Towers set up, and in the more open places Forts, that frighted any from approach∣ing them with Guns, and Darts thrown by the Souldiers: yet for all these things, the outwarder parts were never the more carelesly strowed with Calthraps, and digged full of Pits, which every where yielded nothing but danger, though from causes to them unknown; but the Horse especially, were
on all hands afraid thereof: The Fords and Inclosures pro∣mised easier Entrance on any part. Part of the Ships with long extended Horns, menaced the City, being tyed fast one to another, with strong Cables and Anchors: by which means, not onely Relief, but any Messengers, were kept out of the Town: Some Ʋessels also were thrust forth into the Quag-Mires, which, according to the Ebbe or Floud, either swo, or ock fast, hiding other Boats, that served to carry Provision, and other things necessary for the War, to both Camps, in fit and convenient Creeks; and the Marriners being com∣manded to come a shore to assist Hohenlo, without murmur∣ing, were very serviceable. Most of the Works boasted the Industry of the Souldiers, as being built by their hands, a great Novelty in that time, whose pains was a great saving to the greater charge of Day-Labourers; besides the Excuse of the Country-People, whose Mulitude being forced from their common business in the Fields (as is usual with the Ene∣my) rather procures an Envy in them to Liberty▪ or else be∣ing slothful in time of danger, are by their unskilful Crowd rather burthensom, than helpful to an Army. But by the dili∣gent Care of a strict Discipline, so far were the present Cu∣stoms of the Country People different from those of former Ages, that here the Camp was both to themselves, and their Cattel, a place of Refuge. The Souldiers placed and secu∣red them, they sold their Provisions, and received ready Mo∣ney for the same, in whose Fields, if the Spanish Comman∣ders had pitched, all the Money they could ever have raised, would hardly have been sufficient to have redeem'd them from spoil and injury. Whereas here, under the Fortifica∣tions of the Camp, they Manured their Fields, and sowed them with Seed, as being assur'd of Security, not onely for the present, but the future time. And it was found by practice▪ that they who are Lvers of Justice and Honour, shall volunta∣rily receive those advantages, which others shall hardly exet by Cruelty, and other thwarring Endeavours: It is scarcely
credible, how much this Continent abated the price of Vi∣ctuals, when they that forcibly commanded the same, were afflicted with all kind of Penury. Mansfeldt having viewed all these strong Fortifications, grew much troubled; and, as it is the Custom of an exceed∣ing great fear, resolved on nothing; and, among the rest, that which at first seem'd to please him best of all, was now most disliked: however, he fortified himself, not far from Prince Maurice, with so great a quantity of Artillery, and other En∣gines, as if he had rather been going to assault a City, than a Camp: When he had staid there ten days, and the Horse coming out from Breda had straitned him in Provisions, bo∣ping that all things might more readily be brought from Boisledue, he removed towards Count Hohenlo's Camp, pre∣paring immediatly to drain the overflowing Lake, into the Channel of the Maes: But supposing that too great a Tak, anon he thought to drive away thence the Enemies Ships, or to break off the remainder of the Horse left there, that so be might the more freely enjoy, and have the benefit of Fo∣tage. At length he gathers together Faggots, Bavins, and other Brush-wood, as if he intended to break over the shallow Fordable places of the Marishes into the Town; not so much out of any certain hope, as that least he should seem to have no hope at all: Which while he vainly attempts, and that he ought not to try his Fortune in divers places, the sight of the Town, and the last hopes of the Besieged Souldiers forbad: By this Idleness, and lying still of the Enemy, Prince Mau∣rice's Works were mightily forwarded; but the small num∣ber of his Souldiers was the greatest Trouble he had, for that they were almost spent with continual Labour and Watch∣ing: And the Frizons being again desired. That they having been helped before, would not now leave their Companions wanting Aid: Having for some time delayed, at last send four En∣signs, but not before Verdugo was come with Three Thou∣sand
Men to Slochteren. While these things were doing, there were several light Skirmishes about the Fields, Count Ho∣henlo being more ready thereto, than was necessary: No∣thing more was done, because Prince Maurice being wary, beyond the Nature of Youth, would not hazard a danger in the open Field; and Mansfeldt was utterly out of hope of prevailing upon the Prince's Camp by Assault. But the Town however, was continually batter'd with the great Artillery, whose greater number being with Prince Maurice, had broken and spoiled the Houses, and made unserviceable most of the Cannon in the Town: So that now the Galleries plainly appeared, advanced as far as the main Bulwark, which stood before the Rampire: And on the South part unto the Fort, which was least of all feared, not for the joyning thereof to the Town, but because it was encompassed with a great Trench, a Bridge was made over in the Nigh, the Contex∣ture where of was great Bull-Rushes. The Keepers hereof wee easily surpriz'd, as they lay scatter'd here and there, and negligent by the industrious Souldiers; (for they that took upon them the confidence of being Spyes, and looking in thither, brought back such Intelligence) a few of that negligent Guard escaping into the Town, filled the same with great fear. Before this time, there was no Obedience given to Com∣mand; for, it seems, he that properly was the Governour of the Town, was then absent, being gone out a little before the beginning of the Siege, and there was none other in the place fit for that Employment: From whence it came to pass, that Works were often erected, and as often thrown down, ac∣cording to the wavering Counsels of the several Comman∣ders; of whom, two, to whom the Government of the Town had been committed during the Siege, dyed before; and now the Third, while he runs to meet the Noise of Terrour before-mention'd, being kill'd with the stroke of a Stone, clearly made an end of his Government. Thus there was no
fear of any thing but the Enemy, which Prince Maurice did greatly augment in them; when having interposed Mans∣feldt's Letters to them, which he might have detain'd, he yet sent them to them: For now Mansfeldt, having taken coun∣sel to draw away, admonish'd the Besieged, That they should not therefore abate or diminish their Courage giving them (though falsly) an assurance, that he would, by some other means, divert the Enemy. But the Besieged staying no longer, Article for their Lives onely: They deliver'd to Prince Maurice fifteen Ensigns, there were six hundred that went out sound men, free either from Wounds or Diseases, who left behind them great store both of Provision and Ammunition. But they that had had any hand in the former betraying of the Town, were ex∣cepted out of the Articles; both the Prince and Army being all new exsperated, by the memory of the Treachery, from the sight of the Town, and their former and present Labour and Toil in the regaining it. And so, the same day, the Prince took Gertruydenberg from the Buyers; he made the Sellers expiate their Crime with their Lives. Count Mansfeldt understanding how matters went, know∣ing that his old Age would be blamed, and much worse Coun∣sels prevail after the Event, and that the Reports of these things would be tossed to and from in the Ears of the Peo∣ple, was much afflicted; suspecting moreover, the Fidelity of the Town of Bisleden, least that the People thereof, being of a busie and crabbed Disposition, and having no Garrison to awe it, should fly from them, in a tottering and decaying con∣dition, to their Enemies, crown'd with the growing Successes of smiling Fortune: For Prince Maurice's Souldiers, who then held the Castle of Creviceur, by making a Dam over∣thwart the River Dies, which, at that City, runs into the Maes, had made it overflow all the adjacent places: from thence, Corn-Fruit, and Pasture for Cattel, being lost, by the damage of private persons, they molested the publike Peace: Wherefore it was thought fit to appease them with Benefits
and Kindness, whom they were not able to restrain by Fear or Force: And the Prince finding that Mansfeldt made hast to besiege that Castle, prevented him, by sending before some Horse, which should hinder and stop the Enemy, at the Pas∣sage over the Maes, and keep them out of the Isle of Bommel; and presently after, himself with his whole Army, coming by Water, places himself in the middle, between the Castle and Mansfeldt; and having fetched a convenient number of Cannons and Engines from the next Towns, there being no Rampire or Bulwark yet about the Castle, (for which cause be suspected the suddain surrender thereof) he compelled them, leaving their Tents behind, to take little less than a shameful flight into the Fields about uyck-Anons placing a Bridge upon the Maes, as if he would fall upn Boisledue: by that false fear, he put a stop to any nw Endeavours of the Enemy. At last the Commanders departing, with part of the Forces towards Frizeland, began to make that the Seat of War. Since the taking of Stenwic and Coevorden, scituate more inwards upon the Issel, and the other Frizon Cities and Ca∣stles, had cut off from Groning, both the benefit of the Sea, and of Rivers; there remained onely one Passage out into Germany, and that was the Bourtang: The cross-way whereof is not very broad, and begins at the Bay of Dullart, not far from thence, running through great Marishes, environing the whole Country of Drent, with a long Circumference. The vio∣lent coldness of the Winter, troubled also with cross Winds at the beginning of the Year, had hindred Count William of Nassau, who was contriving by what means he might fru∣strate the Enemies last hope; but now the Spring being to∣wards, he put to Sea, where, as he sailed, he spyed Verdugo, stirred up thereto by Messengers, to have possessed all the streights of the passages; and being forbidden to fight by Command, and considering, that it was an unadvised Act to proceed further than they were sure of Provisions, he landed
in the next place; from whence, by opening the Schises, he might drown the Fields with Water; or shutting them  might, at his pleasure, hinder them, when overflow'd, to be drain'd; and thus, to retard the Enemies March. But when Verdugo had sent part of his Souldiers, to wast the Country of Frizeland, Count William not willing to suffer or pass by that Damage, least he should give matter of Complaint to that Faction of the Frizons, who did not love him (for there were some private Feuds broken out) he himself went thi∣therward, and, where he could, fortified the Border against the like Incursions for the future: Here the Enemy being de∣ceived with vain Rumors of other Attempts, the Count sup∣plies Coevorden with all manner of Necessaries, which before was in great want of many Things. Thus the Summer being spent, and the Enemy turning his Forces towards Gertruydenberg, after they were gone, Count William removes the Forces he had receiv'd, marching by Land, and taking into his power all the Castles between Coevorden and the Bourtang: Upon the very Bourtang it self, where there is a narrow passage between the Country of We∣den, and the Lands belonging to Munster, the Marishes that are next being disjoyned, (for the Summer and Labour toge∣ther had made this place more passable) by a kind of Sandy Cliff, he commanded five Companies of Souldiers, to erect some Huts against the Weather, and to raise a strong Fort: Himself, with the other part of the Forces, (because he had Intelligence of Recruits coming to the Enemy) went behind Greening, being induced thereto by an early conceived hope, that the City would Revolt to him, as soon as Verdugo was gone, who as yet lying in the Suburbs, waited for more help. In this mean time, Frederick Count Heremberg was sent by Count Mansfeldt with a strong party of Souldiers, (because either the Enemies Garrisons, or the Nature of the place had precluded all other ways) to the Town of Otmarsen, and the
Castles, which we told you before were deliver'd to Count William; and these he took with great Force, but not without the loss of some Bloud: From thence puffed up with that success, he went with Verdugo, to destroy the Fortifications, raised upon the Bourtang: But the greatness of the work, in so short a time, the inaccessibility of the Marishes frighted them from their Design; and Count William, being daily in∣formed by his Scouts, that they were coming against him, augmented and strengthned the Fortifications of his Camp; wherein remaining safe, he slighted their Power abiding in the Fields: Nor did he march with any Colous, wisely con∣sidering, there was no necessity thereof for him, and that every thing would infest the Enemy. With this kind of delay, and some light Skirmishes, the Enemy even wearied out, make towards Coevorden, through moist and troublesom ways; but finding there was firm Ground underneath, they dry'd up the upper moisture with great heaps of Bavins. And when the place made them know, that Stratagems and suddain Heats, would be to little purpose, with them who were ready to receive them, Verdugo goes away to the Castles, hoping the Souldiers inclosed therein would quickly want Victuals. But herein his In∣telligence failed him; for they had been twice of late furni∣shed with all Things possible: Then they tempted the Fide∣lity of Caspar Ensem the Governour, both by Rewards and Terrour, but he was resolv'd against both. But now the Year wasting very fast, the Spanish Forces be∣tween Mud and Showers of Rain, were ready to sink to no∣thing, besides there grew among them a scarcity of Victuals, and they had scarce received in 8 Months, so much Pay as was due for two, and they pillaged and wasted all the adja∣cent places, running out even into Germany. Afterwards, the Cold that follow'd, added to their misery of Want, and both of them bred a sad Disease among them, with a great Flix.
Some part of the Souldiers fled both from their miseries, and the Siege together, and not as of old did they run away by single men, now one, and then one; but by whole Com∣panies at once. And Count William did encourage them there∣to, promising them rewards, who ever would come over to him. From hence the Besieged, began to gather both Cou∣rage and Confidence, to make Sallies. Shortly after the Winter made them quiet, while both sides prepare Provisi∣ons and other ayd for their friends: But the Frizns had Commanded Count William, to besiege the Castles that had been lost about Groiuingen: but now the lateness of the year, and the bitterness of the Weather, rather than their Officers Commands, hindred any further motion. Onely a part of the Regiment raised for Verdugo in Germany, being ignorant in the use of Arms, was met by some of Prince Maurice's Souldiers, and slain; But in several other accidental meetings, they fought variously, they being generally, either killed, or taken, that were loaden with Provision or Knapsacks. And Count Solmes harassed all the Land of Wase, that refused to pay Tribute, with the taking away of their Cattel, and some Prisoners: The Castles which he took in his passage, were after his return recovered by the Enemy, and Philip of Nassa making a Road out of the City of Limburg, depopulated all the Country lying round about. But the ambushes layd by the Prince himself, to surprize Bruges, deceived him, at which time, passing by the Sea and divers Rivers, with the dewes and cold, he ws thrown ino a Disease, by meanes whereof, the eturn of the Ships being hastned, one was cast away. The faul o both these miscarriages, was in the Officers, who un∣dertook the Conduct of them in the night. But in the King Army, where mony began again to grow scant, the Souldiers fell o mutiny, the very Spaniards them∣selves beginning the first Sedition: and so little Reverence did they shew to Charles Mansfeldt who commanded them, that they intercepted and kept the Provisions that were sent
to  whose wickedness the Souldiers of other Nations, a great while detested, but soon after, observing that the Muti∣nous received their pay, they refused any longer to be quiet, but inclined to the same courses, and turning out their Cap∣taine, which they believed to dislike such tumultuous pro∣ceedings, they set up the most abject among them, by the con∣sent and choyce of the whole Bands: This Fellow was thus made a Lord over life and death, terrifies all, and feares all, but now will; no longer acknowledge his Authority from an∣others will; but taking courage, he may now with equall danger, either take or refuse the Command: However, be∣ing full of discord and cruelty, while they impose upon themselves, both Counsel and Laws, and there is no pardon admitted to any offence among them, they confess the neces∣sity of a Law, themselves being witnesses of that good, which they chiefly violate. There was another thing that added fuel to the fire of the Souldiers rage, and that was, the sudden and too great parsi∣mony of those Spaniards, who managed and ordered the Trea∣sury, in the revoking all augmentations of Wages, which the Duke of Parma had granted to any for their more wor∣thy Service, or out of favour. And this mad mutinying frenzy was not onely in the consines of France, but among all the Garrisons of Germany, maintaining it self by Rapines and Tributes: At which time, the City of Nuisse, while part of the Souldiers there resident, were gone abroad to fetch in booty, turned out the rest: And this Rule was followed by as many as could, and served to the Souldiers for a Lesson, that either they should moderate their avarice, or increase their strength; In Berck, that was kept by seven Companies of Souldiers, who had cast off all their obedience, there the Mutineers would have no Captain, as the rest of the Souldi∣ers, but chose out of themselves a Senate of one and twenty: nor was that Honour perpetual, but changed accoding to the times. They exacted Tribute of the Country, lying round a∣bout
them, but with a better Discipline, than of late was done under the Command of their Prefect. This Revenue, which within fourteen moneths, had come to near an hundred thousand Florens, was divided among them as part of their pay. And the rest was afterwards given them together with indempnity: Upon such termes did Hermn, Count Herenberg, make an Agreement with them: Many ac∣cused the Bishop Bojarus his negligence, that might have re∣covered his Town with a little charge, and chiefly, because the Duke of Parma onely had kept it: But now being forced to stay in expectation of the coming of the new Regent Er∣nestus, in whose favour he was confirmed, he was for a while quiet. But the Hollanders, though they were free from all the before mentioned mischiefs, yet were afflicted by the angry countenance of the Heavens; for in the end of the year, a very grievous Tempest falling upon the Ulye, sunk in the angry Ocean, a Fleet of Ships lying there at Anchor, to the number of fifty Sayl, that were ready to go into Italy, among the Islands and Shelves filling all the adjoyning shores with Shipwracks and Lamentations. 1594. Ernestus Duke of Austria, sent at the beginning of this year, came into the Netherlands, and undertook the Go∣vernment thereof, which proved fatall to himself, and very unfortunate and lamentable to the Spaniard. For the Frizons were absolutely taken from him; France withdrew it self: his Arms proved unsuccesful: the treacheries of his peace were infamous: the Enemies Affairs were famously happy and flourished, but the Spaniards under him, were poor and mutinous. All which evills prevailed, either to make life irk∣som, or death to be necessitated. There were many causes that had procrastinated his coming, as the Turkish Affairs, want of money, and the Gout, a Disease familiar and custo∣mary with him. But when he came, there were many solemn acts done by the Netherlanders, in Honour of the Regent, and with great shews of joy, such as they had hardly used in for∣mer
times to their Princes, even in the best of times; for now being almost tyred beyond all patience, they interpreted the diminutions of evill for great happiness. Neither had they now a Count Mansfelda, who under the vain shew of Au∣thority, was equally ridiculous, both to his own Souldiers, and his Enemies: they had changed an old feeble man, for a person of great Nobility; and therefore they gloried at once, of that Honour, and their restored Laws, that according to the antient Custom, one was sent to govern them that was of Royal Blood, and by Kinred allyed to the King: They re∣membred, that Alva and Requescuse had stirred up the War by their forraign Authority: And the Duke of Parma, (though otherwise we I enough liked) was maligned for his Country sake; That Don John, who had attained Royal Blood, by all wayes, both of Birth and Vertue, wanted rather the moderation, than the affection of the Nobles and People. But that now there was truly come, the off-spring of Empe∣rours, with a German uprightness, neither infected with ha∣tred or malice, and consequently, more prone to concord: He had governed in behalf of his Brother, the Emperour, both the Pannia's, or Hungary, beloved by the Subjects for his mildness, in the taking care of them, and the blandishments of his leisure time, not much provoking the Enemy, nor himself by them often provoked: Not averse from fighting, when the Barbarians urged him, by disturbing his peace, and it may seem, that he was the rather chosen, as one who might compose the Netherlandish Affairs, the Citizens being even tyred with War, and the King well knowing, that it would be in the Conquerours power, to make what Laws he pleased for the settlement of peace. This Duke Ernestus, was of such gravity in Conversation, that the Netherlanders interpreted it to pride. But which is proper to his Countrymen, being not Superiour in his Af∣fairs, he was easily ruled, either by Counsel or Command: With this mediocrity of disposition, he had so pleased Philip,
that he intended to have married him to his Daughter, and strongly argued in the French Counsel by Embassadors,  confer upon him the Kingdom of France: fearing perchance, that if he should marry her to any Frenchman, and at any time after his Issue male should fail, that Spain, by access to the Crown of France, would become a Province there. But Providence provided otherwise in that affair,  brought Henry of Burbon, through divers variety of Fortune and setled him in the Kingdom: for he being grieved  himself, that being born to a Kingdom, he should onely  depelled for the oretext of Religion. Many of the Princes protesting, they resisted him for  other causes, and by that means alone, could not submit their Fortunes to him; seeing his Forces almost consumed, and  other things that were the main supports of his hope: He ∣gan to grow unsetled in his mind, between some of his Friends, applauding his noble constancy, and others persua∣ding for most advantage. At length, either that he believed nothing more, sacred▪ than the Peace of a Kingdom, or that he had embraced his former kind of living, more out of Form than Judgement, he was Reconciled to the Church of Rome: which thing, was not of so much disadvantage to the Spaniard, but that for many years after, be continued his hatted and War against him, neither till of late, by the strong endeavours of Anmarle, were the Cities of Picardy, adjoyning to the Borders of the Netherlands, reduced unto his obedience. Nay, at Rome, a great while he incensed Pope Clement, and the most power∣full in the conclave, by threats and force, least they should open, or propose a way for the Kings Repentance, and Re∣conciliation, calling him a Renegado from Religion, and a dissembler of novel Piety. But at the first being had in suspicion by both Parties, as well that he departed from, as that he came over to, after∣wards by a sweet and well-constituted moderation, by giving to
these the chiefest Power; to those, Safety, in the Exercise of their Religion, and some Honour, he exceeded both their , and made a Harmony between them, among whom before, there was nothing but Discord: So that now all were pleased, except a few, ignorant how great a benefit they had receiv'd, whom no Felicity could ever please, no Revenge sa∣. In short, Trade and Commerce beginning, in this Cessation of Arms, and the People well pleas'd with this Quiet, it came to pass, that the strongest and most potent Cities, with the Metropolis of them all, Paris, and the chief Heads of the Fa∣ction and Revolt, submitted to him, caused either by private scords among themselves, or the fear of a Forreign Autho∣rity. The Spaniard hereupon, when the Duke de Mayn came to xels, were of opinion to restrain him, as one that was averse to their Design; but the Regent Ernestus, having more regard to his Fame, hindred it; although it were known, he was the chief Instigator of the chief Leader of the Faction, to go in to the King, and merit thereby his Pardon: yet there were some, who detain'd by their own Covetousness, or the Spaniard's Policy did all they could to hinder Peace, delaying by the same the performance of their Expectations. Picardy chiefly, and the parts thereabouts near Henalt and Artots, were molested and perturbed by the Spanish Forces. And the first Spring Charles Mansfeldt, who made War in those parts, had forced Capelle, a free City there, having assaulted the Rampires, when the Trench was dry, to surrender, before King Henry could send thither any Succours. Shortly after, the King himself being conducted with some Troops to Lau∣dune, staying upon those Confines: Towards the end of Sum∣mer, Mansfeldt being driven away, who had indeavour'd to raise the Siege, the Town came again into the King's Power. The Confederate States, about this time, had given a Summe of Money to King Henry, upon condition, That he should
turn his Force upon the Netherlands: But that Queen Eliza∣beth would not hear of; who fore-saw that, together with the War, all use of him, and respect to him, would cease. This De∣fection of the King from the New-Religion, was variously re∣ported both in England and Holland; so as hardly any thing had bin further examined and discoursed, with more variety of Language, and freeness of Judgment: Others look'd upon it with Hatred and Detestation. The Catholikes hereby con∣ceiv'd a hope, that in time, that other differing Religion Rites, though at present receiv'd in publike, might at last re∣unite; and that as France had follow'd the Rule of German so the rest would follow the Pattern of France. But all Leagues and Alliances with Neighbors, were by the King inviolably observ'd: And now the States being  by what private Policies the Enemy gain'd upon them, or∣dered very diligent Care to be taken, That no sort of Writing that might prove dangerous to the Publike, might be foisted  the People; And that Masters which instructed Youth in Lean∣ing should not instill into their Minds evill Opinions. Which done they turned all their Counsel to the carrying on of the war, while the Enemy would seem to seek after a peace: And be∣cause Ernestus having recruited the Army, was reported to have enhanced the Fame and Terrour of his new Regency, be sent out some with Commissions, both into England, and into Germany, to raise Four Thousand Foot, and some few Horse: These Souldiers supposed to be met by the Enemy at the Rhine, though in vain, marched safely and unknown to the Enemy: But, on the contray, Ernestus his Musters were im∣peded by want of Money, and other Casualties; for the Re∣giment of Francis Saxon Lawrenburg assembling by little and little within the Territory of Munster, part of them being slain by the Hollanders, the rest melted away to nothing, and Count Oldenburg denied passage to those that remain'd toge∣ther of them, through the Land.
The Lord of Cimace also gather'd Souldiers, consisting of Flandrians and Waloons, being partly promis'd, that he should be put into Garrison. But they that were Listed by Verdugo, a great part of them ran away; the rest were consumed either by Poverty or Diseases. Another Regiment belonging to tzenburg, were kill'd, partly by the Enemy, and partly by the Boors, about Carpen and Aquisgrave. Others went a∣y into Hungary to those Wars: So that the new raised men being either dispersed, or voluntarily departed, and the old Souldiers disobedient and refractory, all their hopes were  frustrated; and their boasting, That they would divide  Army of Thirty Thousand Men into two parts, and there∣th at once make War on both sides the Rhine, came to nothing. Whereby Ernestus himself, by how much he had raised mens Expectations of him, by so much he fell into present Con∣tempt; especially when Leasure and Pleasure, Idleness and Lust, began to be seen as publike stains upon him: So that he was lashed at by eminent and most bitter Invectives. Be∣sides, he overcharged his Fame among the Netherlanders, in that he would have imposed Spanish Garrisons, upon several of their Cities: And was with great Contumacy refused, both by them of Namur and Lisle. At the first beginning of the Spring, marching into the Field, Ambushes were laid, but in vain, for the surprize of two Ciies which would have been of great advantage; Bois∣ledue was the one, which very seldom gave opportunity to such undertakings, and now preserved by fortune; for the Guards had no other notice of the Enemies approach, than the falling down of a Stone: Maestricht was the other, and there also was a miscarriage by the fear of the Captains which the Prince had sent before in a Ship, and because there were some Souldiers, who unskilled in such Expeditions, knew better to pillage than fight, unless by chance some∣times, we have no more power to command our Courage, than Success, when a fatall Cowardise, and a suddain fear
shall weaken, and infatuate the Counsel and Courage of those, who at another time, are Sons of Valour, and start back at no danger. From hence Prince Maurice went beyond the Rhine, re∣solving to set an end to all those great Enterprises formerly begun in Frizeland, to which purpose, not only Count Wil∣liam's strength, but several new Companies were drawn into a Body; leaving behind only Count Hohenlo, with two Regiments to guard the Borders of Holland: Not long be∣fore this, Verdugoe's Souldiers, while yet the Waters were all covered with Ice, assaulted Delphzile, a Castle scituate  the River Ecnus, they came on at first in a deep silence,  on a suddain, made hideous out-cryes, on purpose to re the Defendants, and they rushed on so unadvisedly, that  the Maritime Bank, which by the unskilfulness of the Buil∣ders, being carried beyond the Trench, reached the Bulwark, there was a sudden tumult, and long dubious Fight, untill a Neighbouring Ship coming in with Darts and Guns, and the valour of the Defendants beat off the assaylants with great slaughter. Then the Groeningers sent to Ernestus Gifts, with humble Supplications, that he would not defer forthwith to send the General, and all the Strength of the Army so often promised, to avert and prevent the common ruine and destruction of the City. But the Prince, knowing that he was feared in Brabant, and therefore that part of the Enemies Forces stayd there, and that another part was engaged in the French War, sending before him Pioneers and Engineers, as well to secure him in his march, as in a Battel, if need should be, steers his course towards Coevorden. He had ten thousand Foot divided into seven Bodies, every of whose Flanks and Rere, were guarded with Horse. It was a new divised Policy, that the Souldiers armed with Lances and Pikes, and a few Engines, or Guns in the Front, should break the Enemies Troops, (for Ver∣dugo
put the greatest confidence in that part of his Forces) and then the Cavallery being wearied, would easily be rout∣ed. Upon the left side, were placed the Carriages and Wa∣gons that brought Provisions to the Besieged, with some of the best and stoutest Regiments. At the right side they were nclosed with Artillery, and the River Vidre; Verdugo also had drawn up his men in Battel-Array before the Works, as if he had desired to see the Strength and Courage of the E∣nemy, knowing he could easily retire into the Coverts of his defences upon occasion. Here the Prince took Counsel, whe∣ther he should break through the Fortified Marshes, to the Besieged, or seek a more secure way to get to the Castle. But  Spaniard, under the silence and covert of the night, draws of his Regiments cruelly shattred with long penury, and y to mutiny at the eminent danger, together with the Duke of Parma's old Souldiers, marching with them towards Oldenzeel: there he pitched his Tents, and suffered the Soul∣diers to glut themselves with prey, instead of pay, wasting the Fields of Germany, robbing and stealing with so much more greediness, for that they believed they should not stay long there, for fear of the Enemy. Some of these Souldiers were sent beyond the Eems to Lugen, a Town under the King's Command. Others were dispatched away to Groening, that the common people, who are naturally unstable, might be kept in awe by them, and any danger, arising from sudden fear, be prevented: After the appearance of day had discovered the nocturnal slight, and that the Castle was open: and the deliverers and Be∣sieged, had with joy among themselves, and extraordinary thinks to the Prince, saluted one another: the next thing in design was, what had hitherto been aimed at, to set upon Groening by force, which in the former years, they had so sorely tetified. Although it was very strongly fortified both with Walls and Bulwarks, neither wanted any thing, either as to Victuals, or other Warlike preparations for defence:
And not a few of the chief Frizons, had rather the City should have continued in the Enemies power, than come into their own, as believing it would draw the Trade from all parts thither. However, the Horse being sent away, that they might stop all passages against the Enemy, as well at Steenwic as at Coevorden, and the Bourtange, leaving only the Zuphen Regiment, to trouble and restrain the Enemy, if need should be, the great Guns were carryed by Sea. The Prince at his first setting out, came into those Fields, that formerly had been unfortunate in the great slaughter of many of his party: for he was descended originally by the Mothers side, from the Saxons, who dyed in the Siege of this place, or else his lbour long in vain, compelled him to omit that unhappy possession▪ nor had it been of mean advantage to his Uncles, that the Civil War had invited them thither. The ancientest Inhabitants thereabout, and such as had sur∣vived the many years of the troubles, shewed the very place, wherein Adolphus of Nassau dying, stained with his Noble Blood, the spol taken from Count Aremberg, by him slain, and the first success in this quarrel: They could point out also the Castles, by whose Sieges, the Count Lewis of Nassau, in vain, hoped the defection of the Cities, and the peoples reciprocal endeavours for liberty. Then not far from thence, Lemmingere, and the Coast hard by, fatall for the slaughter of seven thousand men. But the Prince and Count William (for they both com∣manded alike, without either discord or emulation) as if ha∣ving survived the glory of their Ancestors, they would re∣move the unlucky Omen from those places, they take up their Quarters round about the Town, the Prince himself lying on that side, where Groening turning away, as it were from the Frizons, looks full upon Germany, but not any thing stronger in that part with Towers, Forts, or Rampires annexed to the Bulwarks, or with any out-lying Fortifications. But before I declare the Siege of this famous City, it will be worth our
time, to shew the scituation of the place, and the several sorts of Nations, that frequently meet there on several occa∣sions, and the rather, for that we have nothing any where else to this purpose. The Nations beyond the Rhine, included within the River Eems, wihout all peradventure, are of famous Anti∣quity: the greatness of whose Age, as is common with other people, was made fabulously incertain, before the Roman Empire propagated the fresh memory of things by their Ar∣mies: then was the Valour and Fidelity of the Frizons highly renowned: The name of the Frankes was of a later Edition, part of whom lived, as is believed, by the River Salium, which the Antients named Sala, and we by adding a syllable to the word, call it Isala, or Issell. And from this River Sala, were the Salike Laws denominated. I cannot set forth the Foun∣ders and Original of them, more then of all Germany, the Antients maintaining with a constant Opinion that they who lived there, were Aborigines, that is, at what time the Gene∣rations of mankind increased, or ambition forced them to ha∣zard, the Sea in quest of new Habitations, they were such as first possessed this utmost shore, or boundary of the Ocean: But in the mean time, I may not deny, that part of the Nor∣mans and Saxons, and what other Nations frequent those Ma∣ritine Coasts with their Fleets, being left in those places, grew up together into one Government, and used the same Cu∣stoms; And afterwards, they by the same example, poured out the superabundance of their increased Generations, at further distance into the next, and also into remoter places: But chiefly it is to be observed, in two Kingdoms, to wit, of the French in Gaul, and of the Angles, or English in Britain, whose beginnings must be drawn from these and other bor∣dering Nations: But I cannot asser their manner of living, of what manner of Government they had in those ruder Ages, with any certainty, unless I should suppose they had alwayes bad Kings: but then that was not a name of arbitrary and
unlimited power, but as it still is in Germany, where the chief managery of all great affairs, is as well residing in the people as the Princes. But afterwards, the Empires of Germany and France, being united (though quickly disjoyned) the middle people ran one way after liberty, the Princes drew another way, to subject them, by which means, all things became un∣setled, and nothing stable. And then Christian Religion not being alike received by all Nations, as it disjoynted the Go∣vernment, so it disaffected mens minds one towards another, while others assuming the vizor of Sanctity, made themselves Imperious Priests. The wiser sort, rather chuse themselves a Captain, and seek forreign Wars against Barbarians, in∣croaching upon them by Sea and Land; from hence they fell to War among themselves, and though they agreed in Religion, yet there wanted not quarrels, which under the pretence of Piety, were at last disputed with fire and Sword Thus the Bishops and Counts, dividing the Hollanders among themselves, seized likewise at once, all the bordering Nati∣ons they could gripe within their reach; for in the first place, Zutphen beyond Issell, was added to Gelderland: Hence, all that Region, which is properly called Over-Issell, and under that name the people of Twente, Zalland, and Drente, were all subjected to the Bishops of Ʋtrecht. But that part of Friza∣land which lies within the Ulye, after a long contest and Re∣bellion, submitted to the Jurisdiction and Customs of Hol∣land. That part which lies beyond the Lake, and divided by it from the rest, was cruelly afflicted with War, and mortall Battels, being oftner beaten than subdued: because the Princes of Holland, scorned to rule at the pleasure of others. And the Frizons esteemed their liberties, both descending to them from thir Ancestors, and also confirmed by several Decrees of Emperours: Wherefore taking Counsel among themselves concerning a moderation, out of their own num∣ber, they chose one to be a Moderator in their chief Affairs, giving him the name of a Podestate. But Groeningen, a most
strong City, from all Antiquity, and the chief of Frizeland, was much advantaged by the conveniency of the River Eemes, and the Neighbour-hood of Germany. From thence of old, besides the fierceness of their nture, this City had nourished a certain hope, that as it was the Metropolis of that Region, so in time it should command over all the Coun∣try of Over-Issell. Which being denyed by the Fortune of War, remaining yet great in its contracted Jurisdiction, ex∣tended its bounds to the Rivers Leck and Eemes, and for∣bidding any Merchandizes to be exported into other places, unless they were first brought, and offered to be sold in the City. A Fortress of this Potency, after it had once gained Re∣nown by Covenants, and the use of right sometimes chose for∣reign Princes, and as oft changed, and cast them off, to whom they payd Tribute in Honour, as their defenders, but ever with a Salvo for preservation of their Laws; and this was well enough at present, while they endeavour to get favour; but when these Tributes were afterwards consumed in envy and prodigality, the mischief of the example appeared, it being natural to Princes, by any meanes to keep what they have gotten, and to increase by force, their beginning Wealth, if they be not absolutely obeyed; wherefore the City growing stubborn, and not contented with the liberty it enjoyed at present, but impatient of servitude, though at the same time shaken with many intestine discords, yet from the hatred of the present Lords, it still chose other, being ignorant of that good, for which Arms are taken away from the people. Thus first experimenting the Bishop of Utrecht, it fled from them, for fear of the Saxons, to the protection of some living beyond the Ems, then to Gelders, and lately devolved to the House of Austria; yet the Groeningers kept to them∣selves a power of chusing all Magistrates, one onely except∣ed, who was the Prince's Legate or Deputy, who sate as Chief
in the Supream Assembly of the Judges, that had Cogni∣zance of the Rights of possession in Lands. In this Warre, wherein all things have been unrivetted, being vexed with most horrible Seditions, at last it consented to the Spanish Dominion, under the pretence of Liberty: This was not, as other Cities, tormented with Disterences in Religion; for when the Laws aged most furiously against all the Profes∣sors of the New Religion, those that fled from all other pla∣ces, found here a Refuge and shelter: But because there arose great Discords between them and the Citizens, the Confederate Lords, either out of a Love to Turth, or in favour of the Nobility, gave Sentence against the Citizens: But the Spaniard being more crafty, favoured the City, and there upon it submitted to his Government; being perswaded by this one thing, they rejected Religion, and all Leagues, to follow Renneberg, (so prevalent in all men is Thirst of Hatred and Revenge.) It is to be remembred, as we before declared, that the Groeningers had refused a Garrison; for so they had agreed with the King, who also to gratifie them, indulged them with the freedom from many Burdens: But of the common for of Spaniards, they hired Three Thousand: The Forreign Soul∣diers, to the number of Nine Hundred, kept the Suburbs: There was hardly any where to be found so great a quantity of Provisions, Guns, Gunpowder, and other Military Engines, as was here: The Camp was placed a great distance from the City, that the great Artillery might do the less harm to the Houses, but was most strongly fortified, both against In∣vaders from within and without: A firm and wholesom Plain extended it self between the Rivers Horn and Scuy∣diep; which Rivers beginning in the Marishes of Drente,  through the Trenches of Groeningen and intermingle with the Sea at a place called Reidiep. And because all the Army was not sufficient to incompass the City, therefore on this side they thought fit to make their Assaults and Approaches, be∣ing
here also able to receive the Enemy if he came, that so they might, by opening the Rivers, overflow all the circum∣jacent parts: And it was found by Experiment, that the ad∣joyning Waters were no less advantageous to the Tows, for keeping away the Enemy, than it was prejudicial to the in∣closed Succours. And the Prince also carryed the Rivers so, that he might easily bring his great Guns over the Fields, against the scattering Forts: some whereof, being deserted, were easily won. But the best and noblest of them all named Adoardysel, when the Governour had defended it with more Resolution than the present necessity requir'd, the Bridges and Ladders being taken, it was assaulted by the Souldiers with so great fury, mad to revenge the slaughter of their Companions, made in the same place the Year before; that neither the too late delivery was accepted, nor the word of Command, how, and when to give the Onset was staid for: Thus they made a great slaughter, which was also increased by an accidental fire then hapning: This Fort being taken, provisions were more easily brought out of Frizeland into the Camp, the people of Embden sending in no small quantity, until Verdugo terrified them with Threats, bidding them take heed, they betrayed not their Affection: Some successful Sallies were made, both out of the Town and Suburbs, the Keepers of the New Works being tyred out with continual shows; for those Works, out of a Military Ambition, were more hastily, than warily promoted. The next and greatest Care was, by little and little, to un∣dermine on both sides the Port; the one whereof was defen∣ded by the Bulwark adjoyning to the Trench; the other, by an outlying Fot. The great Guns, on both sides, plaid very furiously; and however the Rampires, nd other Works made of Earth, resisted the Force of the Attempt, yet the Bridges, Gates, Towers, and other Buildings, were utterly overthrown: And some Letters being taken, that were sent to Verdugo, it appear'd by them, that their store of Gunpowder, what be∣tween
a prodigal Expence thereof, and other Accidents, was well near consumed. They were advised therefore, least be∣ing left by their Associates, some of whom were in France, and other continued mutinous and full of Sedition, that they would not, being thus shut up by the Army, rashly, and without reason, seek their own ruine. To this it was answer'd, but not as if it came from the Be∣sieged, but such as were proud with the Memory of their ol∣der and more novel Affairs, That they should not be provoked by the greatest of their Commanders, without danger, although they were not all of one mind, but had many causes of difference among them. The Assemblies of the Commons, whose Authority was greater in the publike Affairs, than was necessary, had de∣liver'd all their power to the Magistrates; and a little before the Siege they had sent Messengers, to get them some Suc∣cours: But the Netherlandish Cities, took no Thought of their so great danger, all their Labours and Endeavours be∣ing busied about the New Regent, they knew so profusely to wast their Money, as if they had not known, that by the want thereof many times, the greatest Affairs are hazarded, and Opportunities lost: Therefore, there were some who propo∣sed, that the City should be deliver'd to the Duke of Bruns∣wick; Hohenlo was a main stickler in that Advice, because, if it succeeded, he promis'd to himself, that he should be his Deputy-Governour. But the Siege utterly blew away all those Imaginitions, which being once begun, there follow'd fre∣quent Treaties between the Besiegers, and Besieged; some∣times, that they might bury their Dead; other times, that they might exchange Prisoners, and upon many the like occasions: Sometimes also, they made short Truces, which, at lst, the Townsmen desire one to be continued, until they could send to Bruxels, for a more certain Reply, but it was meritedly re∣fused. Jorgius, who was the principal person among all the Ma∣gistrates, before that the Cosul, and now a Collonel, withstand∣ing
Peace, and confirm'd therein by the incouragement of the Jesuits, had drawn unto himself the Rout of the poorer sort of People, who had neither any hope or fear in the continuance or change of the Weal-publike: These threatned death to all Messengers that should come from the Enemy; and like∣wise to every one else, who but spoke well of Peace; not ab∣staining, in the interim, from committing Murthers and Rapines: But now the Ravelins, and other nearer places, be∣gan to preach Ruine; among which Evils, it was far the most miserible Spectacle, when the Darkness of the Night was turned into Light, by the burning of Houses, fir'd by the Enemy throwing and shooting Fire-Works into the Town: And, as the People gather'd together in Heaps and Multi∣tudes, to save their Houses and Estates, either were them∣selves burned in the Houses, or else maimed and mangled with the Besiegers Bullets. At last, what should they now, being between Hope and Despair, avoid? or what should they defend? since all places were equally fill'd with Hor∣rour and Lamentations: But, for all this, the Priests, and such as the Spaniard had obliged to him by Pension, attribute to this obstinate stubbornness of their peculiar Faction, the name of Constansy: Nay more, at this time, some out of the Gar∣rison, that lay in the Suburbs, passing the Trench in little Boats, took the confidence to enter the City: These, on the one side, calling them in: those, on the other, forbidding them: from whence there arose a most violent Sedition, wherein, at the beginning, there was some bloud spilled, but soon after it abated, for fear of the Enemy abroad. The Prince, that by the prosecution of the War vigorously, he might, at some time, force to thoughts of Peace, began to undermine the greatest of all their Forts within the Trench, wherein there remain'd some marks of the Fort or Castle, rai∣sed there by the Duke of Alva; and that he might the better conceal the Policy, by some other more apparent Design, he seems to threaten the taking by storm of the Bulwarks alrea∣dy
batter'd and shaken. But when the Assailants saw the vast concourse of the Townsmen to the place, as if afraid to come on, they retired; at which instant, the Gunpowder that was hid in the Mine, being set on fire, the torn up Ground threw the dispersed Multitude into the adjacent Ditches and Trenches, and cast some, at a greater distance, into the very Camp or Leaguer: Others of them were swallow'd alive in∣to the gaping Chasma of the disbowel'd Earth. Then might have been seen some Souldiers (Scots by Nation) whose Hast and Valour carryed them towards the City, together with such as fled, but hindred from entring it, because the Planks that made the Bridge passable were broken; how∣ever, they maintain'd the place, opposing great Bags, fill'd with Sand, against all Shot and Darts thrown at them: And now all the whole Army burned with a desire of doing some∣what more, earnestly requiring the Slaughter and Ruine of the City, which they said must be won by force: That this was the City, by whose wickedness all places beyond the Rhine, for 14 Years together, had either been exhausted by War, or at least spoil'd: Wherefoe, now they ought to require in the punishment thereof, satisfaction for the Ruine of so many Castles, the laying wast of so many Fields, and the Bloud shed in so many cruel Battels: That this might be an Example unto the rest, that they should resist until they were subdued; and malapertly, with insulting Answers, scorn Mes∣sages, and Offers of Peace: For what could be more glori∣ous for a General, than to take the benefit of his Victory upon a Rebellious City, Triumphing in the Saughter and Spoils of all that relate to him? But if he should prefer the pub∣like good, before the Injuries offer'd to his Bloud, or the Re∣venge of his Ancestors, yet this City was not to be preserv'd, having always been injurious to the Neighbours, untractable against the Laws, and perfidious to Liberty; against which, having for some time opposed, it had almost brought Ruine; and, at last, if it should be subjected, would yet be infamous.
These Things were publikely urged, as every one had be∣fore-hand, in his Imagination, divided the Spoil of this most opulent City: But the Prince, and the Senators, who were present with him, thought it more convenient, for carrying on the Remainder of the War, that the Souldier should be restrain∣ed from his licentiousness and cruelty against the Citizens: Thus Embassies and Prayers prevailed; within the Agreement were included several Degrees of Things; nay, the very Priests, who had departed out of the City, and all that belonged to them, consented to the League; and that they, together with their Companions, would, by an equal Right, be admitted within those Articles. Thus they accepted a Garrison, while they were accustomed to this New Government, and Count William of Nassau was made their Governour, being before the Governour of Frize∣land: Both the Forreign Souldiers, and those that belonged to the City, marched out safe the Seventh of the Calends of August, (that is, July the 26.) The Prince entring the City, restored the Protestant Religion, casting out all Images, and, as he had concluded, appointed MAgistrates, especi∣ally chusing them out of those who bad before been banish'd for their Religion, the Laws, for the future, being in force: Concerning the Discords of the Natives, which formerly being disputed by Arms and Fighting, were not yet appea∣sed; there was a Settlement made by the States of the Confe∣derate Ʋnion. And, in the interim, Otho Hartius, and Hierome Comannus, came from Bruxels to the Hague, as if they had been sent up∣on private Business to the Lord of Cimace's Wife, who fly∣ing from the Severity of her Husband, lived here, as it were, in Banishment among the Hollanders. They did not Treat of Peace, as a Business of so high a Nature did deserve; but onely cursorily seemed to bring Letters from Ernestus, wherein were discover'd the Charges
and Burdens of War, and the great Commodities of Antient Commerce and Obedience: That there were never any Discords had continued perpetually, but some few had been decided by War, but the greater part thereof setled by Peace: Wherefore, If they had hitherto been terrified by any Treacher∣ous Dealings, yet he hoped they would not blame the well-known Reputation of the House of Austria, or have him in suspition, desiring to be the Author of Peace: Nay, that he left his own Country and his Brother's House, with to other hope, than that he might restore a true and sincere Harmony and Concord among Christian Nations: That it would be seem the States, inter∣changeably on their part, not to hazard the prosperous estate there∣of, their Affairs, and the ambignous condition of their Adver∣saries, upon the Danger and Fortune of an uncertain Warre, but rather take advantage from the present Times, wherein they may rather prescribe, than receive the Terms of a Peace. Hereunto the States, being now more firmly setled, an∣swer'd, as to their Cause, magnificently, That it was for Religion and the Laws, which in the time of the Emperour Maximilian, the Arch-Duke Matthias, the Bro∣ther of Ernestus, had by the Sword protected; That since that, by the implacable Malice of the Spaniards; having been forced to Arms, they have not been ignorant of the various Chances of Warre, but God had appeared for them, even gasping under the Burden of Oppression. And now being raised by qreat Alliances, and their own Valour, they had rather chuse that (to wit, War) to be a Judge of the Event, than an Enemy so often found persidi∣ous. And as the Spaniard could not lay aside Arms, without the Consent of the Kings his Allies; so also the same Impe∣diment lay upon them by several Leagues. And here they shewed several Examples, when Peace had either vainly or falsly been pretended to be sought; and they had no more
Reason, at this time, to hope for better, of more safe pro∣ceedings: For Philip was so far from remitting old Offen∣ces, for advancement of the Peace of Christendom, that he would rather suffer the Barbarians to enjoy all Europe, than he himself would leave off, to infest and trouble other King∣doms by Arms and Treachery. That it was most evident, from Letters of the same Philip, written to William Clementius, wherein he was commanded to delude Caesar with fair Words and Promises: adding, That the Turkish Power would easily be diverted from the Spanish Empire by Gifts and Presents: Nor did the States forbear to signifie, That the power of concluding a Peace was Deputed unto the Praefects, but the Right and Power of preserving it was in the Lords. In short, what hope could they have, while the Nether∣lands were oppressed with Forreign Souldiers, and the Spa∣niards, who still sit at the Helm, would by their nefarious and cruel Counsels, would absolutely reverse all the good which Ernestus intended. The Opinion of many among the Romanists, in hatred of Pease, was too commonly cast abroad, That no Faith is to be held with such as differ from them: Meritedly sure was the Mischief of that Invention turned upon their own Heads, while they, by an endeavour of setting Men together by the Ears, break off and spoill all Commerce. To all those that practice Equity and Honesty, they never alter their Evil Habit; and least they should enjoy their Perfidy too long, themselves became an Example against themselves: Nay, the very Common People, who, for the most part, are first weary of Warre, being inraged with the Memory of the late Villanies of the Enemy, would not by any means hearken or incline to any Thoughts of Peace.
And now the Spaniards fearing Prince Maurice's youth, grown famous by so many Victories, and the league of two Kingdoms, from the greatness of their terrour they so far con∣temned infamy, that they hired murtherers by particular stabs to bring that to passe, which they were not able to com∣pass with all their Armies: And without doubt, there was no time so detestible for such horrid wickedness, insomuch, that from hence, no one could expect from them any true peace, who by giving place to hatred and revenge, would even violate the Laws of Arms. For in this very year, wherein they desired a Treaty, first a Priest of Namar, afterwards another Renegado Souldier, were hired to become assassine, but prevented barely by suspicions, gathered from the extra∣vagancies of their looks; but the designs of so great Treasos being once, though with difficulty, and but darkly, discerned, were soon after, for fear of the wrack, laid open, and the whole contexture of the horrid villany discovered; wherein first the Prince himself, then his Brother, Henry Frederick, and after them, several other persons, eminent in the Com∣mon-wealth, were designed to be slain: and every one for a particular cause; as Leominus, becuse he had revoked from the Kings party; Aldgud, because he had excited the Duke of Parma to disloyal mistrusts of the King; Olden bar∣evelt, because he was looked upon to be averse to peace. The Traytors names were Michel Renichon, and Peter Furius: but let us see the Authours, who being persons in eminent place, and capable of Honour, yet had bound them∣selves to the perpetrating this infamous act. And they were as fellows. First Fontayne and Ibarra, two Spaniards, Stanley the betrayer of Deventer, and of the Netherlanders; La- and Barlaymont, the heyr of an inveterate hatred to the House of Nassau, and also Assonvile, of old suspected, for the murther of the former Prince of Aurange: Of all these, the Traytors gave particular accounts and demonstration, partly by force; but chiefly, by a voluntary confession, after
they were condemned to die, and could not hope for any re∣ward or favour, for casting aspersions upon others. Nay more, the Promises and Exhortations of Ernestus him∣self were related, to Renichon, by assuring a large Pension for his Reward: but to Furius in these very words. [If thou performest, what thou promisest me, and dost kill that Tyrant, thou shalt surely go the ready way to Paradise:] yet there wanted not some, who from hence would interpret, that the countenance of peace, which the Regent would seem to have put on, was but dissembled; averring, that he onely coun∣terfeited a face of modesty, the more neatly to hide the cru∣elty of his heart: However it was, 'tis certain, that Comannus and Hartius, who were in Holland, when this Treason of Reichn was discovered, denyed Ernestus to be in any man∣ner culpable therein: adding also, that Barlaymont would be ready, if they would give him a safe conduct to come and send pledges for his safe return, to appear and refute the before mentioned scandalls; but in regard he could be ad∣mitted no otherwise, than to be punished, if he were con∣vict, the conditions were refused. About the same time, Lodowick Lopez, a Portuguese, but of Jewish extract, being a Physitian in England, was appre∣hended, who was convict by proofs and Letters, to have un∣dertaken to poyson Queen Elizabeth, for fifty thousand Du∣cats promised to him by the Spaniard, for the same, for which he was, as he well deserved, put to death. The Authours of the Treason, were said to be Christopher More, Fontayne and Stephen Ibarra, then residing at Buxells, whom Queen Elizabeth contented her self, to have sharply reprehended in certain Letters to that purpose, sent to Er∣nestus: wherein she gave the name of Jesuites, to the inciters of such villanies, and desired that they might be delivered to her, to be made a publick example: this she urged, not that she imagined to obtain her Request, but that she might thereby cast the greater ignominy on the Spaniard's Reputa∣tion.
There were several other Attempts of the like so broke out not long after, from a sort of men, wonderfull by their vast increase, their Lenity being as ready to promise the perpetrating of a Crime, as to discover it. Towards the end of the Year, the Order of Jesuits began to be infinitely hated through all France, by means of o John Castel, a young man bred up and tutor'd among them, and perswaded by his Masters, that no Kingly Rights or Pri∣viledges belonged to him that was separated from the Ro∣mane Church: This Fellow, when the King returned out of Picardy to Paris, endeavour'd to have stab'd the King into the Neck; but the blow, by the bending of his Body, hit him upon the Tooth: The Parliament of Paris so abhorred the monstrous Fact, that they were not content with the punish∣ment of the single Offender, but pulled down the House that nourished such a Viper, with all its Superstructures; they raised a Pillar to preserve the abominable Memory of so hor∣rid a Fact, and from thenceforth banish'd the Jesuits. For to these, chiefly, both the English, Hollanders, and French, did impute the fostring of such Doctrines, on purpose breeding Youth, whom, under the Notions of Piety and Magnanimi∣ty, they inflame, and incouraging them with Old and Ne Examples, how often Tyrants, who are Enemies to the Pub∣like, have been destroy'd by the Fortunate Darings of pri∣vate Hands. Concerning this Order, because Opportunity presents it self, and others have spoken little concerning them, I intend succinctly to Discourse. The first Founder of that Order was Ignatius Loyala, who being much weakned by a Wound received in the Ward Navarre at Pumpeiopolis withdrew his Mind, being yet War∣like, and full of Courage, unto Businesses of a more peace∣able Concern. Among the rest, he grew ambitious of Erect∣ing a New Order: To which, in hope of its future Great∣ness, he would not, according to Custom, give it the Name from some more famous Man or Woman, but even
from JESUS himself. Being Assembled by Authority of them who can License such Novelties, they reverenced with incredible study two Things chiefly, to wit, the Pope's Power, and the Spaniard's Wealth: And at their beginning, they were main and eminent Props to the decaying Cause; indu∣cing in defence thereof, what had hitherto been neglected, Manners unblameable, and sound Learning; they exercised themselves in frequent Disputes against divers Religions, which in those times had insulted over the Romane Name. They augmented their Glory both in America, and the In∣dus, where, among Barbarous Nations, by the Teaching of Christianity, they adde mightily to Philip's Empire: yea, and many famous Miracles have been done by them, as is belie∣ved with great facility from confident Asseverations; for that the Longinquity of places excludes further Tryals: how∣ever, they are in abundance, whether in real Truth, or but pretended. They are the persons, in whom thou may'st re∣quire fidelity and modesty; Their Authority with the Vul∣gar is very great, by reason of their Sanctity of Life; and because they instruct Youth in Learning, and the Precepts of Wisdom, without taking any Reward for their pains: They have their Provincials in every City and Nation, and there is one Superiour over all the rest throughout the World, who is for the most part a Spaniard: They command with great Wisdom, and obey with equal Fidelity: They follow not the common Custom of other Orders to live all together: It see∣med too poor to include within Walls their growing Socie∣ty; They Baptize and solemnize Matrimony; and the first thing they are taught, is, To lay aside all Humane Affections, and to cast away the fear of Death: They chiefly take into their Society none but such as are very eminent, either for In∣genuity, Bloud, or Riches; and they reap a great benefit from all those things: For, first, they distinguish Ingenuity no less prudently, than they chuse it, pitching always upon such whom they hope will grow famous, either for Eloquence, or digest∣ing pious Meditations into Writing.
By their Nobility, they are admitted into the greatest Coun∣cils, being of an incomparable Sagacity, in making Searches and Experiments; and because there is no Engine so strong as Religion, for the laying open of Secrets. And their Wealth fits them for Embassies, and all other publike Employments: By which Policies, though they are the youngest of all other Orders, yet they have far surpassed all the rest in a short time, both in Reputation and Wealth; and therefore are hated by them, and their manner of Life upbraided, as contrary to Rule: But they being above the Envy of their Emulators, even rule Prince's Houses, by a laudable moderation; for they ob∣serve a mean between sordid submission and severe arrogant, neither totally eschewing, nor following other mens Vices. These are the main Wheel, whereon the Spanish Greatness and Empire moves, by which they maintain Peace at Home, and sow Trouble and Sedition abroad. For those Catholikes have receiv'd a portion of these mens Spirit, which through France and England, yea and Holland it self, do in the former maintain the Rights of a Kingdom, and in the last dispute against it. And although they are banish'd all those places, upon pain of Death, yet is that Danger no Obstacle to them, nor doth impede either their Confidence or Policy. But the Emperour did not forbear again to motion the making of Peace, although before refused, and stain'd with such mon∣strous Actions, as we before related, upon the common pre∣tence of Germany, viz. the Care of his Brother's Honour: Not did he seem onely to admonish them to it, but calling a Diet at Ratisbone, of the Princes and Cities of the Empire, he had caused it to be concluded, That they should be compelled ther by Arms, for that they dampnified both themselves and the Neighbours, by the perpetual miseries of War. But these things, as they made onely a Noise, never proceeding further than Words and Threats, so they were accordingly taken no∣tice of; for the Turk then chiefly, being ready to fall upon the Cities of Hungary, as well the Care as the Forces of Ger∣many,
was taken up, and could not have leisure to mind the Affairs of such as belonged not to them. This year also, the States of the United Provinces, received a very great and most honourable Signal of Affection from James King of Scotland, as well as the Kings of France, Eng∣land, and Denmark, who were invited to the Baptizing of his Eldest Son, born by his Wife, who was the King of Den∣mark's Daughter. And their Liberality was correspondent to the Honour done to them, as witnessed their most rich Pre∣sents given to the Princely Infant, who was named Henry Fre∣derick. They renewed their antient Amity with the Scots, and restored all the Rights of Trade and Commerce, and all other matters formerly concluded with the Princes of the Netherlands, and particularly with the last Charles: But a Partnership in Arms was in vain wished for by the Scot, and the Dane; and that the Princes of Germany should be inga∣ged to the same Affinity; for their Peace was safe and un∣molested, and there was no reason why they should go to thrust themselves into other Folks Troubles: 'Tis thought there was some hope gather'd from Scotland, not without cause, offended with the Spaniard, who had for many years disturbed the Peace of that Kingdom by Factions: From hence proceeded many of those sharp and severe Laws a∣gainst Catholikes; and hence, by increasing hatred, came those who would transfer the most just Hope and Title of James to the Kingdom of England upon the Spaniard's Dughter, but surely by most absurd and incongruous Arguments; but ne∣vertheless, such as discover'd a mind ready to do him any in∣jury. But as well the Scot, as the rest of the Princes, cast off from one to another the beginning to thwart a Power so for∣midable to all. The Embassadors that had been sent into Scotland, returning by England, the chief whereof Waldgrave Brderode, whose Noble Birth advanced the Honour and Worth of the Common-wealth, together with James Count Valquin, consuled of certain Matters, relating to the
League: Then began to appear, how much those Presents were envyed, which had been bestowed, to gain the King of Scots Affection; the Queen of England objecting to them, Their unseasonable Magnificence, while yet themselves wanted Forreign Aid. Nor did it proceed so much from the Hu∣mour of her Regal Disposition, that would endure none to vye with her, as that she being a wise and subtle Woman, and who would keep the Succession incertain, as one of the main strengths of her Kingdom, she would not, that a Prince, though next to her, both in Kingdom and Bloud, should be appointed her Heir by the Option of her Neighbours: There∣fore, according to the Custom of angry persons, she requir'd a part of her old Debt, and if they gave her not satisfaction, she threatned War: Whereto a modest Excuse being made, they were at quiet for some time. And, in the mean time, that they might make amends for their Offence, upon her Request, They obey and grant, That they will adde some Mo∣ney and Ships to her Fleet, for driving away the Spaniard from Bretaign in France: For the Enemy being setled in some strong Ports, lay at lurk upon both Shores, to get the posses∣sion of that Sea, which passeth by both France and Spain: From whence proceeded the English-mens fear; nor could the Hollanders sail to the Westward with any safety: But now the English and Dutch Fleets being joyned, they drove the Enemy from most of the strong Holds scituate on the Sea-Coast. But the War, after the taking of Groening, continued in the Countries beyond the Rhine, although there were other Things, which promised their Hope a Reward of their La∣bours. But at the instance of Mounsieur Buzanual, King Henry's Embassadour, it seemed more just, since their own Affairs had so well thriven, to look towards their Allies, because then there was sharp War upon the Borders, between the Nether∣lands
and France: Some there were that would not have sent Souldiers to the King, but Money, which Buzanuall withstood, affirming, That the King his Master had better learned to order Souldiers, than Money: And so far did his Reasons prevail, that he had not onely very great hopes, but the Charge likewise already begun, would forthwith be laid aside for a New Expedition thi∣ther. The Spanish Souldiers, who had hitherto made War upon the French Borders, after they had received their Money, and taken the benefit of what Licentiousness they pleased, being excluded from all Cities, lest they might grow more insolent by Idleness, under the Conduct of the Lord of Cimace, besieged Cambray: For that City, as is be∣fore set forth, was delivered in the Name of the Kingdom of France, to Balagny, to be kept for King Philip; but he, on the contrary, usurped it to himself, from thence the Neigh∣bouring Country was wasted: Nor had the Spaniards long continued the Siege, but they wanted all Things necessary, not excepting Provisions: However, lest that they might seem to do nothing, they surrounded the City at a distance, but with very careless Gua; for being in their Friends Country, they supposed themselves terrible enough to the Enemy, being in no manner changed from what they were before; but onely in this, that now being under Command, yet they re-acted the Crimes of Sedition; among other of their Exploits, many times, fetching great Booty out of France. But Henry, the greatest part of the Traytors being sub∣dued, finding himself really King, and that he was so increa∣sed in strength, that, though till this time he had been able but weakly to defend his, now he appeared able to vindicate himself, and to threaten an equal Return for Inju∣ries.
He accused Philip in an Edict, That he had, without any probable Reason, broken the League that he had made with France five and twenty years before; That he being King of France,  content with the Dominion of his Ancestors, which by the Divine Providence, he now enjoyed, and being an august and magnificent Possession, he did not desire to intermeddle in the business of other Princes. That he would not seek a cause of War, against the Neighbouring Cities of the Netherlands, and hoped he should not be forced to one, by injuries put upon him: but since they had com∣pelled him, he exhorted the People of Henalt and Attoys, and others his Subjects, to fall upon those forreign Souldiers, generaly hated and burthensome to all about them, whom none ever hated without danger but an Enemy, and to drive them out of the French Territories, and also from Cambray: which if it w not done by a set day, he would bring thither his Armies, and t his force upon them: This was all received in silence, as if it had been denyed, for the Cities durst make no answer: but Philip shortly after, mindfull of his affections to the Catholick Religion, and remembring the League himself had formerly made with France, declared that the Prince of Bearns, (for he would not vouchsafe the King of France any other name, who had vainly pretended himself an honourer of that Reli∣gion which he had opposed, and now called himself King of France, was to be prosecuted with War on all hands: Be this came too late, for after they had for a whole year, dis∣played their Ensign on the Netherlandish Borders, all after actions seemed to claim a shadow of right; But to this for∣reign War, King Henry appointed Commander in Chief, Turnis Viscount Turen, who then raised the Repute of the name of Bulloyn, renowned also by Alliance to Prince Maurice, whose Sister Elizabeth descended by the Mothers side from the Royal Stock of Bourbon, he had marryed. And in this he would be more affectionately diligent, in that thereby he ad∣vanced above the power of the League, a Prince bound
him by private Allyance, and also very high in the King's favour. It was thought convenient, to carry the War into the Pro∣vince of Lutzenburg, because this way he might have a pas∣sage for his Italian and German Levies: for the Hollanders hoped, that if new forces were raised, it might be possible to bring to nought the old, being neither many, nor well agree∣ing; and this either by the Netherlanders consent, of the conjunction of War: But a Messenger met Philip of Nassau, as he was hastening his march towards the French, with sup∣plies, consisting of eight and twenty Foot-Companies (for the States having onely promised twenty, had now of their own accord, augmented the number) that they understood by four Switzers, whom they had taken, that Charles Mans∣feldt, lay in the middle between them. Therefore for secu∣ring the Journey, he took five Troops under the leading of Sir Francis Vere, and a well ordered number of Foot, least he should give any opportunity to Mansfeldt pressing upon him, and leads them beyond the River Moselle, to the Bor∣ders of Metz, for the Enemy had prepossessed all the places more inward. The greatest part of the Troops, having either gained by leave or force, a passage through Germany, returned into Holland, but the greatest strength of their Horses was consu∣med in the length of their Journey. But the greatest damage that fell upon those was, that the Horsemen being far from home, became licentious, committing many robberies and Rapes, which either for that Reason, or else in regard of their Religion, or some other causes, mightily turned the Peoples hearts against the Hollanders: But the Earl of Bul∣ds having in charge matters of greater concernment, but his Forces not able to compass the same, not daring to be∣siege Lutzenburg, after he had received the Auxiliary Forces, about the latter end of Autumn, went to Paris for further Counsel and Instructions.
And it appeared by the Event, that by reason of the con∣stant allowance of Pillage and Rapine, the Strength sent for supplies were hastned, both with great damage at home, and other hazard: And that the Enemy came not into the very heart of Holland, during the sudden and most sharp Frost fol∣lowing, was not the success of their Counsels in their own defence, but the evill Fortune and Discipline of their Ad∣versaries. For Sedition had spread it self all over the Kings Army, and the end of one mutiny, was but the beginning of another. This madness, as well for the generality thereof, as the se∣verity of the remedies applyed thereto, far surpassed all be∣fore it; because the Tumults began not in single Regiments, but several Nations at once: not in the Borders, but in the very Bowels of the Netherlands; for now hatred had enfla∣med the Souldiers avarice, which is the prime cause of all such extravagancies: The Italians, a Nation by Nature emu∣lous and spiteful, observing that the Spaniards had their Wa∣ges payd them, in regard there was likewise at the same time, pay due to them, presently imagined themselves slight∣ed and affronted: At first a few of them onely complained, That then they lost the esteem of their labours and blood, when the Duke of Parma, the chief columne of their party, and a most just rewarder of vertue in all, dyed; but although he were dead, yet from him the Spaniards possess the benefit and Grandeur, that at present makes them insolent: That they were now as despicable, hurried from place to place, at the option of a few, who make a stalking-Horse of Ernestus his good Nature, and the Kings Wealth: But it should sud∣denly appear, that they had Arms, wherewith they could challenge their due against all those that defrauded the King of his Treasure; neither ought they (the Spaniards) to be displeased at the Example, since they themselves first broke the Ice: And if any one resisted them, he should find, what
men Italy bred, who before this time, had brought in sub∣jection the reall Spayn, not that which is now so called, be∣ing an abominable sink of the basest Nations, who reckon Pride and cruelty, instead of all other Vertues. These first threats were now seconded, not onely by Cor∣porals and inferiour bands of men, but the valiantest of their Commanders began to speak the same Language: with which incouragements, as if they had been possessed with some sudden frenzy, all the Italian Souldiers marched with their Colours to Sichenen, a Town of Brabant, which, in re∣gard of its strength and Scituation they seized, from whence they fetched in booty all about, even as far as Bruxels: with these, many Souldiers of other Nations joyned, as French, Irish, Epirots, and even from Italy, such as had formerly been in service for the Netherlanders, and all under pretence of peace, and hope of rewards, they refusing to entertain none but Spaniards onely. At all these disturbances, the Officers were present, which, in tumults of such nature, is very rare, as if they had now been about to contest the honour of their Nation, not by any right of Authority, but so prevalent more or less, as they ap∣proved themselves notably active in heading the Souldiers rage. New men were daily listed, and enrolled in the Com∣panies: the mark and badge of their faction, was a swarm of Bees, before which stood the King, and this by a military jest, and facetious quip, they called the Common-wealth. They imposed Tribute upon Lands, and exacted Toll of all things that were carried out of the Country. Prince Maurice, and the Hollanders, politickly fomented this Sedition, for fear, least if they should reunite, they might receive thereby some unlooked for damage; and the rather, because there was a very great Frost, which had continued rear seventy dayes, and had covered with Ice, both the Marshes and Rivers, that they would bear the greatest and most weighty Carriages.
Thus while the Enemies Country, was tormented on one side with the French War, on the other side with mutinies of their own Souldiers, first precluding all places to reduce them to poverty, and afterwards, by raising all Provisions to an excessive price; The Treasury was taken into considera∣tion: and therefore they being graciously heard, who were sent to Prince Maurice, declaring, that they were not obli∣ged to the Spaniards by any right of Country, Kinred or Al∣lyance, but only served them for pay; which not being given to them, they supposed themselves no longer tyed to their defrauders. And if any should come to assayl them, they would make use of the Law of Nature, which hath com∣mended to all Creatures, even by instinct, self-preserva∣tion. Thus a Truce was made with them, but when they de∣manded Tribute in the Land of Cuycke, where the Prince had some paternal Possessions, Herman Count Heremberg, was ready to defend the Country people denying the same, if the Prince upon his Request would have permitted him. But here also the Souldiers necessity, who could not so much weaken one side, was more prevalent, than all the Reason of the unarmed multitude, which things, when they came to be related at Court, as they were by the Spaniards represented to the worst, there was a division in Judgments thereupon, some averting a necessity of mercy; but others replyed, that although in some Cases gentleness was necessary to be used towards Souldiers, yet these being grown most insolent, and having also a national hatred, were to be made exemplary, least the Souldiery should make it a Custom to mutiny, and throw off their obedience, as often as they should fail of their pay, so soon as it was due. Besides this, the necessary of the time did incite and provoke the most moderate per∣sons, because otherwise, when there was the greatest occasion for them, they would obey no orders or Commands.
Among all these advices, it was not concealed from them, what further rigour was thought upon for them; for they, according to the subtlety and craft of their Nation, had hired Spies, who gave them Intelligence of all that passed. Nay, and some of the Noblemen did voluntarily favour the Italians, out of hatred and impatiency of bearing with the Spaniards. Victualls, Ammunition, and all things else fit for War, were reasonably provided for them, when the Spaniards come into the same Province with a strong patty of Souldiers: at first they dissembled the cause of their coming; but when they were not able to come near the Italians in these Arts, they marched out seriously to shut them up in the Town, and being so inclosed, by Famine to reduce them to Reason. Anon greater numbers are gathered together, and several Castles assaulted, with the loss of much blood, and so much cruelty was used, that they are reported to have been pri∣vately slain in the Spanish Camp, that either by foresight, or other affection, repugned those Counsels. But now none would suffer it, that they should come to punish a fault in others, whereof themselves but lately, yea, and often before, had been guilty. Thus on both parts, they shewed a most pernitious ex∣ample. These, in that they would savagely shed the blood of those who had been mutually engaged with them, and were bound by the same sacred tye of an Oath: Those, that being taken for Enemies, they desired Ayd from Enemies indeed. For though they made their first Address to the King of France, yet he commended them to Prince Maurice as nearer, that so keeping the Sedition a foot, he might, when time should serve, have ayd from them, and enjoy the Va∣lour of so many Couragious Men; whereupon, Pledges being delivered on both sides, they confirmed the Truce formerly made.
Then they delivered up the Forts and Castles, and because they durst not rely upon the Town, against an Army ap∣proaching with Cannon, and other Artillery, the whole Bands, accompanied with their Wives and Children, march∣ed away in the Covert and silence of the night, through pla∣ces not infested by the Enemy. They took up their Winter Quarters not far from Bile∣due, being secure both in their Rear and Flanks, for that the City of Breda, Hesden, and Gertruydenburg, did inclose them, and were at all Essayes, places of refuge for them, when in danger; and in the Iuterim, for their more useless Company, places of aboad. If they wanted either Victuals, or Provisions of War, they were supplyed not otherwise than as Allies and Companions; And besides this, the Prince not despising the fame of liberality, even from Enemies, furnished them with Artillery, and added to them some Horse, that in their going abroad, they might more power∣fully compell the Country to pay Tribute, or revenge them∣selves upon occasion by depopulations. Thus daring to do even the greatest acts of Hostility, yet not positively become Renegadoes, they made up as it were, a third party in the War. Things being at this passe, shortly after, the Regent Er∣nestus sent Messengers to them, promising their pay, impu∣nity, and a free Psse-port; But when they understood by some intercepted Letters, that they should be circumvented and brought to punishment, a long time after they suspected all things: Nor were the onely troubles in these parts, round about they were as unquiet; for not a few, both Horse and Foot-Souldiers, when they fled from Verdugoes Camp, be∣ing pinched with the extream want of all things, and help∣ed by the People of Cleves, went beyond the Rhine, and so into the parts next unto Brabant. Besides the Garrisons of Dunkirk, and of St. Amand, and Capelle began to grow re∣fractory to Commands: And to be brief, the very Spaniards themselves, but a little while before appeased, now again
wanting their pay, had begun a Sedition in the Town of St. Paul. And the causes of all these evils, proceeded from that old negligence, and ill husbandry in the disposing of mony, and that Ernestus was not able to punish the meanest offen∣ders. As also that the American Fleet was shattered and knised by cross Winds, and retarding diseases, almost into as forlorn a Condition, as the Spaniard's Credit: Moreover, there were other damages they suffered by the English, who although they were not so fortunate this year, in the South parts of America, yet in Brasile, their Voyage proved well, having taken the Town of Fernambuck, where they got a most wealthy and plentiful spoyl. The following Winter, as it proved very dangerous by the fierceness of the Frost and cold, and other wants, to the Spaniards lying at the Siege of Cambray, so it gave oppor∣tunity to Verdugo, to make a Journey into Frizeland, and the parts about Groeningen, wherein he only vented his malice, in wasting the Country, and burning the Villages. And now the Cavallery belonging to the United States, when he returned out of Germany, least he should often do the like, lay in the way to hinder him. This Winter also, the Hollanders suffered very great loss by inundations; for the Waters having been long frozen up in the Rivers, as soon as it began to thaw the force thereof, together with the Snow dissolving, and falling violently from the tops of the Hills, which was much in∣creased by great Rains, made both the Maes and the Rhine sell over their Banks, and drown all the adjacent places, making a great destruction of Cattel, and doing infinite da∣mage to the Country all about. Towards the end of this Year, an uncertain expectation had attracted the mindes and eyes of all People, concerning a famous Judgment, while some think severity expedient, but others by too strict and nice a scrutiny, blame every pretence given to such as are studious in mischiefs.
Arnold Dorpius, sometime Governour of Zyriene, when it was besieged by the Spaniards, and familiarly convers with the Prince of Aurange, with whom he was very free in Discourse, so managed both his own, and the publike Affairs, that he was become the Object of Envy, from the common peoples vanity, in giving him the Name of The Rich Dor∣pine. He, at the Death of the Prince of Aurange, being laid aside, had received from Monenius, lately returned from a Danish Embassie, so of the Covenants agreed upon with the Dane: It fortuned, that the Embassadors sent from Ernestus shortly after to the Dane, objected the same things, that there might be an Alliance with them, whereby the Hollan∣ders might be dispossessed of, at least disturbed in, their Nor∣therly Navigations. Thus the Secret was known to have been disclosed by Dorpius: From hence a stronger suspicion was conceived of him, and while his Papers are perused over and over; at last, a Copy of the Letter is found, wherein he exhorted Ernestus, To put himself into a Disguise, and come to the Hague, where professing himself hitherto unconcerned in the War, but now the Author of Peace, he would strike a fear into his Enemies from the common people, and would win both to himself, and to all Lovers of Concord Repute and Trust. But when Dorpius constantly averred, That this Letter was written to  other purpose whatsoever, than to try his Wit, and exercise his In∣genuity, he was freed from Prison, and confined to his own House; but afterwards, by giving in Pledges, he was dischar∣ged; the heat of the Judgment, as is usual in such cases, vani∣shing by little and little: and, as in the power of many, so at last he procured his Pardon. But Menenius, who descending from the great and publike Session of the Judges of Holland, to be an Assistant in Dort, had made himself a part of the Commonwealth: being now degraded from that, was put after∣wards to write the Annals of his Country, and had therefore an Annual Pension; not so much for any great hopes of his La∣bour,
as that the Leisure of the Man, being of a great Inge∣nuity, and well Learned, but of an active and restless Spirit, might seem to be employ'd in some Noble Affair. The Fourth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1595.AT the beginning of the Year, Ernestus called a Council at Bruxels, wherein he discoursed be∣fore hand of the great Things he was wont to undertake; which, at a glance, were excellent Matters, as if he had inten∣ded to confirm their Antient Laws and Customs: But power was not given to the States, according to the Old Custom, of judging concerning the Weal-publike: Onely the Bishops and Nobles were summon'd to meet, because the Nobility are an Ornament, and Authority to Soveraignty, and the Clergy are bound to be faithful by the Tye of Religion: The Commons are staggering and unconstant, being greedy of any kind of Peace; and therefore, except in the case of Tributes, are not to be hearkned to. As soon as he had gravely declared the great pains he had taken for the making Peace, in all other Things he desired their Counsel: Whereupon Areschot, a Noble-man of the first Rank in the Netherlands, is Report∣ed to have made a Speech in these words: Our Fore-Fathers, in precedent times, not in any manner byas∣sed with Hatred, but onely because they were commanded, took up Arms against most valiant Nations, but chiefly the French; nor were they ever frighted at the Dangers, or started at the Evils
that follow Warre, while they fought in Defence of their Princes Greatness: And therefore they brought to pass the most difficult. Matters by their Valour and Wisdom. But now our Arms and Counsels are at little use, our Miseries and Calamities are the things wherewith we are best acquainted: And this War, which is nick-named Civil, certainly cannot be believed such, especially in the contemplation of the Mortall Jars between Fellow-Citizens, and Countrey-men: What then! Do we desire Peace? Certainly, it had behoved us long since to have cared for that, while those things we would have had preserved, had yet remained in being, before our Cities were burned, our Fields wasted, and a generall want had surprized our Families, which is like (for ought I see otherwise) to lye upon them even to Futurity: But if yet, after thirty years continual slaughters, we have not deserved rest, yet at least free us from another War? Must we go against the French? first let us secure our Backs from the Hollanders: But if it seem more convenient, to take Vengeance on those first, and that surely is very necessary; let us not blow up our hopes with too much self-conceitedness, lest while we court what belongs to another we en∣danger what is our own. But you will say, Peace is now offered to us: I answer, It is so indeed: But, pray consider, what cause of War hath the French? And how do the Hollanders drive of Peace? No surely, I rather believe, they are sensibly displeased, as well at ours, as their own sufferings. They cry out, let the For∣reign Souldiers be all sent away, for they are full of cruelty and pride, and utterly discordant to our Customs, who have no shew of Modesty, nor more Fidelity or Conscience, than to serve their oc∣casions: We say, these things are spoken maliciously, and by Ene∣mies; true: yet those things we suffer by them is little else, than what Enemies use: Ask the people of Artois; Inquire of those of Henalt, and other Provinces near thereby, to whom the Proprietors impute the Dearth of such Fertile Countries: They will tell you, 'tis true, the French took away a little, but the Spaniards robb'd us of all; and the like may be said of all other Forreigners, who,
however they disagree among themselves, yet unite to ruine the Ne∣therlanders. Thus under the Names of War and Sedition, we  made a Prey; but the Injury done to us, leaves not off here, but we must be delivered to the Rule of Forreigners; so stupid  we our selves accounted by them, while our voluntary patience kes us become their Laughing-stock; whose Lusts and Plea∣sure, if they still prevail above our Complaints, and it be thought  to incourage wickedness, by conniving at it, we shall at last be forced to do that, which the necessity thereof will sufficiently ex∣cuse, both to the Christian World, and to our Soveraign the best of Kings. While he was yet speaking, the chief of every Degree once round about him with a general Consent, and rejoy∣cing, That there was one found amongst them, that durst publike∣ly speak the Troubles of their Minds. But the Spaniards were even mad against him with Fury; for divers of them were present: Fontain had avoided to be at the Assembly, because he was out of hope to be preferred before Areschot; and his Pride was too great to follow him: So really did he thirst after a real potency, that he would not slight the appearances thereof. I have observed, this very Areschot, through all the storms of this War, to have adhered to the Spaniard with great candor of heart, being such, as bearing an unspotted Fidelity to his Prince, yet would not make his Honour sub∣servient to the Lusts and Pride of Strangers; and being sen∣sible of his own Authority, was accustomed ever to use his freedom without check, mocking at the King's Ministers, be∣cause their Arrogance was hated by all, but himself was ne∣ver feared beyond words: Wherefore now secured, by the greatness of his old Age, he cast out those Words, which were looked upon as Oracles, so highly did they please the Peoples minds: Without doubt, the Netherlander's Hatred to the Spaniards, was never greater, since the Peace made at Gaunt; and some believed, that the Hollanders, as much as they could, heighthen'd it, if as formerly, under the old
Prince of Aurange: So now the Government was not in ma∣ny hands, but one Single Person managed the whole Frame of Authority, and all the Secrets of Leagues and Amity. The too great power of the Spaniards, and the Reciprocal Hatred, for the difference of their several Customs, were the first causes that inflamed the Netherlander's miseries. Fontayne given much to sleep and gluttony; and also, being taken in the very act of Adultery at Antwerp, was Reported to have very narrowly escaped Ruine. Stephen Ibarra was a Man of a more approved Ingenuity and Diligence, but all his good Qualities were sullied by Pride; which also was the cause of an irreconcilable difference between him and Charles Mansfeldt, insomuch that Charles had very nigh kill'd Ste∣phen: And the Spanish Souldiers took hold of this Pretence, to cry out, They would be commanded by no other Officers, than those of their own Nation. Christopher More was a good Coun∣sellour, and together with Idiaques, ruled Spain; but he uurp∣ed also the Right of Domestick Power: Yet Didaco Ibarra, a man of so bold a Spirit, that he complained to the King by Letters, of the small Authority the Spaniards had with Erne∣stus, which he supposed the chief cause of all the present E∣vils: Taxis was more subtle to py into Dangers, and did perswade to win the Netherlandish Nobles, with great Preten∣sion; of Honour; but to keep the ordering of the King's Treasure still in the hands of the Spaniards, whereby, as with a private Knot, tie unto himself all other Mat∣ters. Ernestus having heard out Areschot, and being in his own Nature full of delay; and knowing that he could by that means best pevent their Violence, answer'd, He would ad∣vise with the King, to whom he would also be an Intercessor, for attaining such things as related to the Peace. This hope support∣ed their Minds, although their Evils were not yet remov'd: For after both the Kings of Spain and France had proclaimed War, the lesser Towns of Lutzenburg being possessed, which
could not resist the Storm; the Count de Bulloin wasted all round about, nay, and ranged even to places far distant with Fire and Sword: But yet the Enemy met with four Troops belonging to Philip of Nassaw, which they either kil∣led, or put to flight, being circumvented by Ambushes, and the overflowing of the Rivers; and afterwards, in a greater Battel of Horse, the Victors prosecuted their good Fortune: Against the more potent Cities, Policy was rather used than Force, yet the Success was not therefore answerable: There was Chance, which really might have increased more Parties to the War, and made it break out in all the Borders, if there had not been more difficulty in keeping, than acquiring; of which this is compassed often by Boldness and Temerity, but that must be maintained with Care, and many excellent Policies. Hoye is a Town of the Bishoprick of Leige, which Authors believe to be the Remains of a greater, and more Cities spoiled of old by the Incursions of the Barbarians; and the Scituation perswades this, from the running of the River Maes through it, which a Stream breaks into, that runs with more violence, than scantiness of Water maketh shew of; this Brook gives Name to the place: The Soil, that is all about it, is very rugged by reason of Iron Mines, and an∣swers to the Nature of the People: It hath an Arched Bridg, the Rising Bank, on the right side, is over-looked by a large Castle, seated upon a little Hill: It is a choice place of Re∣cess for the Bishops, in regard of its pleasantness; and no less difficult to be Assaulted, because of its steep Ascent. But while it was assured, both by Peace and Right, those few that by there in Garrison, and spent their time in Riot and Idle∣ness, and did their Souldiery Duty as a Work of Supererogation: and by the like neglect all the Buildings Erected upon the Rock, were equal to the Foundation of the Castle. One of these Houses, by the consent of the Owner, Heraugier, the Inventor of such Stratagems, who was Governour of Breda, by him taken, commanded to be fill'd with Thirty Souldiers,
who, in the Night, by the help of the Window and Ladders, going out, and first using silence, then by continual beating of Drums and Shouting, hindring the Prospect, they took the Keepers of the Castle, and bound them; in help of whom, while it was yet but the Dawning of the Day, their Captain came with six hundred Horse, and one Thousand five hun∣dred Foot: But the Townsmen, though at the beginning of the Tumult, they ran to their Arms, when they saw so many Souldiers at their Gates, and others over their heads, affrighted with that double Terrour, losing their Courage, they submitted. Then Heraugier, placing therein a Garri∣son, sent his Horse abroad into the Fields, and the Country within the Maes, which were subject to the Spaniard, to col∣lect Tribute. This Exploit of War, committed against a Prince who was at Peace; and however he did not affect the Hollanders, yet in regard there had been no Hostility decla∣red against him, according to the Custom of War, might with more facility be answer'd to the Spaniards, than excused to him. Not was it altogether unlike that of Bonne and Berck, which being formerly taken in War, should be retained, now that the whole Archbishoprick of Colen was in peace. When therefore Bojoarus, the Bishop of Leige and Colen, had sent to examine the matter, and it was answer'd by the States, That it was rather out of present Necessity, than any Right they claimed; neither would they do any Damage to his Government, or Subjects; but onely having taken a Town from the publike Enemy, they were ready to restore it, when Arms were laid down on both sides: And that Bojoarus did not deal justly with them, in suffering the Spaniard to enjoy it; and thereupon the Conditions were refused, wherewith they were sollicited to Renditi∣on, being in themselves very reasonable, but that the conveniency of the place perswaded the contrary; for that Castle was a great Safeguard to their Journey, that the Holland and French Forces might the more securely meet; and in that Town they intended to place those Italians, which had formerly deserted the War, being
far from the Borders of Holland, and in a rich Country, where they might have their fill of Plunder. As soon as the Bishop saw himself slighted, or at least de∣luded with Procrastiuation, gathering together some New Souldiers, whereto were added fifteen hundred Foot, seven hundred Horse, and fifteen pieces of Artillery, under the Leading of Lamot, he besieged the place on both sides; for the King's Commanders voluntatily gave their Assistance, their Interest being no less concerned, than the Bishops, lest thereby the Hollanders should come to possess all the parts have the Maes, and so connect the Country: Nor did the Spaniard's want an honest pretence, because the Country of Leige was fiduciary to the Princes of Brabant, by severall Leagues of Philip Duke of Burgundy, and Philip the First of Austria. The Town was easily gained by Scaling Ladders, and Breaches, for it was but meanly fortified, and all in it, that resisted, were slain. The greatest part fled into the Neighbouring Castle. But from the next Hill, which the Hol∣landers had neglected to possess, being higher than the Foun∣dation of the Castle, it was sorely batter'd, and below it was undermined: For there was present a great Number of the Native Inhabitants, who, being accustom'd to dig for Mettal in the Iron Mines, were very skilful in the Art of undermi∣ning. Heraugier judged, that the Garrison might have held the place longer; and with the hopes thereof, he had gather'd together Forces for their Relief: But fearing, at length, lest his Journey should be hindred, by the overflowings of the Rivers, although there were in the Castle Subterfuges and Seluces, to prevent the inraging of the Enemy, at the Siege the Castle was surrendred, being observed by many, that he was better at suddain Enterprizes, than the patient enduring of tedious Hazard. He complained, That the Succours pro∣mised both from the French General, and the Italians at Sichem,  fell short of his hopes, in answering the Event, and that the
Wall wherein they put their greatest trust for defence, was not, as it was supposed solid, but made up of two Walls, which gaped  in the middle, and that the innermost parts of the Castle, were, by the Enemies Battery, laid quite open. The Souldiers that march∣ed out, that they might not be abused by the Bishop's men were protected by the Spanish Commanders, with so much ho∣nour, that some of them drew their Swords for their Enemies▪ against their Companions in Arms: For Heraugier had Co∣venanted with them, not immeritedly fearing, lost the Laws of Arms should not be observed by the Leigois: The Bishop was not content to have punish'd those, whom he thought guilty of the Stratagem, but he took from the City its Au Liberty, as suspecting it to be unfaithful to him: Nor did he leave off to seek Revenge against Heraugier himself, object∣ing to him Cowardliness, and sending a Transcript of soe Letters to the States, wherein he had irreverently spoken a∣gainst them. Prince Maurice, and such as with him were conscious of the taking of Hoye, defended him chiefly among the rest, be∣ing thus brought in question: The possession of this Forreign City was not kept long, it being regained the 41 day after it was taken; and the benefit of the Fact was lost, though the Envy thereof remained: And by chance it had hapned, that the same day, wherein afterwards a Messenger arrived with the News of the Rendition of the place, contrary to all men's Expectation; the States believing the strength and se∣curity of the place, had given a rough Answer to the Bishop's Legate, to wit, That they would deliver Hoye, when the Enemy surrendred Berck. But the Spaniards added to the possession of Berck, that also of Hoye, and when they once had it, kept it, until their Wages were pid, and the Enemy removed from those parts, and then they thought they might with safety enough deliver it. Herein Philip sought the Fame of Piety, protesting, That he would rather bestow out of his own, upon the Church of Leige, the
most antient in the Low-Countries, then that he would, under any pretence whatsoever, take ought away that was its proper right. Four hundred of them that marched out of Hoye with He∣raugier, were slain by fourscore Horse of the Enemies, while being loaden with prey, and too covetous to preserve the same, they hindred themselves; In like manner, were they justly punished, who going out of the Garrisons in Over-Issell to plunder the Territory of Munster, were in the night by the Enemy surprized. Among all these Affairs, King Henry, that he might com∣pell the Enemy lying about Picardy, to look to his own busi∣ness at home, commanded his Generall the Count de Bulloine, with as great an Army as he could make, to enter into that Burgundy which obeyeth the Spaniard, by the name of a County, taking opportunity, from the conveniency thereof, because there was the greatest passage for Traffique, both t of Italy and Germany: The first Onsets were very vio∣lent, with great terrour taking the Towns, and killing every where all such as came to resist, which, at the best, made but a tumultuary croud of the People of that Country, who had not, through the whole course of their lives, known what War was, so that it might rather be termed a Butchery, or Massacre, than a War or Fight. Yet did not all this make the Spaniard remove his Forces out of France, towards the Netherlands: but upon knowledge of the danger, Velasco, Constable of Castele, (which is an hereditary nme of digni∣ty) who then governed Millayne, for the Spaniard, with a Select number of Horse and Foot, drawn out of the Tran∣salpine Garrisons, marched over those Mountains of Alpes, in the deep of Winter, while their tops were covered with Snow, and in the passage took some Cities, resting at the River Sone, where staying for a great Recruit of Horse, and other choyce Souldiers of Germany, and Spoleto in Italy, and hereby giving no opportunity of sight, the French Forces be∣gan to moulder away.
Among these hazards, and flying Messengers,Ernestus his sickness grown more violent by the Winter weather, begin to get the upper hand, and besides, he knew he had incurred the Spaniards hatred, yet had not given any satisfaction to the Netherlanders, and that his Enemies accused him to the King, as a guilt stuck upon him, as well his endeavours of War as Peace, with the thoughts whereof, his grief so en∣creased, that soon after worn away with a lingring Fever and Flux of blood he dyed. His death was suspected, as it is ge∣nerally of all Princes, but was without any troubles or com∣motions attending it, the hope of peace subjecting the idle and the tedious labour of a multiplyed War, employing the rest. The Physitians looking with great circumspection, into the true cause of his death, upon the dissection of his Body, delivered their Opinions, That there was a Worm in his Reigns then living, which gnawed all the parts lying near it. The Vacant Government was by Philips Orders, supplyed by the Senate: among whom, the chief management of War and Peace, and all other business Foreign and Domestick, rested in Fontayne by the name of President; for Ernestus, a little before his death, had by writing, committed that charge to him pro tempore, by the advice of the other Spaniards, and shortly after, the King confirmed it. Nor was he unfit for so great a place of Honour, although otherwise vitious enough, as the Affairs of the Netherlands managed by his care, wit∣nessed, as well as those of other places. But the Low-Country Noblemen, that could hardly bear him while his power was fat less, and but derivative from that of another, now receiv∣ed and carryed with envy and disdain, the Ensigns of Ho∣nour, which they took from his hand; crying out, that cer∣tainly, their Fore-fathers were Prophets, when speaking of this their own Country, they foretold, that they should in time become a Province to the Spaniard, That after Alva, and Requesens, or which is later, Reda for a short time, and as it were for a shew, they had their own Laws, but the same
arrogance of the Spaniard quickly returned: That now the whole power of peace was in strangers, who being equally vicious with their former Lords, yet came not near to them in Honour and Dignity. Thus every one murmured to himself, and some of the more couragious stuck not to speak out to others, viz. That it was very grievous and ignominious to all people, to be subject to strangers: nor is the hatred of Kings so it, that when the Governments of many several people is to be be∣stowed, they will give to others the Command of them, who are willing to be in servitude. Therefore Charles Mansfeldt, out of a sense of Military Honour, finding himself to have been taken notice of with an eye of Enmity (as one who had contested first with the Duke of Parma, then with Ibarra, and now with Fontayne,) and that he was laid aside under the pretence of Honour; with those Regiments which Philip sent to the Emperour, he departed to fight against the Turk, who at that time grew very potent in Hungary. There being next of all to Matthias, who was General of his Brothers Army, he not long used his antient Valour and Policy, a∣gainst the well-skilled Enemy, before among all the dangers of War, he was taken away by sickness. But Duke Areschot, that the Netherlanders might never see him inferiour to Fon∣tayne, voluntarily exiled himself to Venice, protesting he went thither, where he would dye free, and where Fontayne should have nothing to do with the more happy People, because the Germane Souldiers, that kept Bruxells, making a small distur∣bance, he had endeavoured wholly to possess the City by some Regiments of his own Countreymen. This was odious to all, so that now the tumults of others were not more feared, than the modesty of the Spanish Soul∣diers: And the rest of the Cities were possessed with the same fear: Hence grew a double distemper, from these com∣plaining that they were excluded, from the others, that they were almost detuded; however, upon this occasion, the
Fields were harased by both. Whereupon, when a new mi∣sery was added to the calamity of the former year, and with the very fear of want, the price of Victuals was inhansed, the common people took to themselves such liberty, as is proper to poverty, and thereby vented their griefs and sufferings: This made the mindes of all people of all degrees, more in∣clinable to peace, the desire whereof had been first inflamed by the hopes of it given them by Ernestus: nor was Fontayne any longer able, by vain experiments, to resist the current of their resolved desires. The Family of Croy, was the most earnest of all in labouring for peace, of which Family, the Marquess of Haure, sent Letters to James Malery, of old allyed to their Stock, but then of great Eminency in Prince Maurice's Court, which were the very Index of his affecti∣on, and being by Malery shewed the Prince, and by the Prince to the chiefest of the States, Malery was commanded to write back to the Marquess, that there would be hopes of peace conditionally, if the Spanish Souldiers going out, not onely of the bowels of the Netherlands, but Lutzenburg also, and Burgundy, would remove from them all cause of fear; whereto the Marquess returning a reply, but passing by that whole demand in silence therein, Malerye was again com∣manded to write to him, that there might be means of agree∣ment and Concord between the Ʋnited States, and the States of the other Provinces, be found out, but that they would have no Treaty with the Spaniards. Therefore an Embassey was prepared to be sent to Prince Maurice, in the name of the Belgick Noblemen (for at this time, Areschot was not re∣tired to Venice) whereby they desired him to be just and fa∣vourable to their allyed Nobilities. To this Treaty, came Theodorick Liesveldt, sometimes Chancellour of Brabant, when Frances de Valeis held the Go∣vernment, together with Masius and Hartye, all wife men and well skilled in the prudent manage of Affairs.
The Prince was then at Middleburg in Zeland, to whom being brought, they spoke seriously to him, to the effect fol∣lowing. When first the forreign Souldiers had made a prey upon the Netherlands, by means of intestine discords the Senate, who then had the Authority, determined that civill strife, and made the King agree to a League: Nor will it be any difficulty for them, after they have agreed among themselves, to free their Country from forreign Arms: Not long after that first League, many things intervened by the fault of both sides, or else by the wrath of the Divine Providence, which hindred the well-nigh cured wound, to heal and grow well as it should; but rather made it fster worse than before: At this time, the same Senate sits at the Helm of Government, and being we aried out with the same, or greater Calamities, do entreat for an end thereof from their Neighbours, and they might be confident, the Senate would not be wanting to give them satisfaction, and this they might expect with the more reason, because the Covenants were desired of them, while they were prosperous▪ and in a flourishing condition. That they had no doubt, but Prince Maurice, where such a thing may be with Honour, would rather chuse to leave his fortune, than by tyring it out, force it to forsake him, in regard there is no thing so much suspected by a wise man, as long prosperity. In good reason there∣fore, they hoped, they came to advise with his Highness, who had outgone many of the most famous Souldiers, to preserve intire his gotten Renown; That he had many great Governments, and plenty of all other things, wherewith to content the greatness of his mind; That the Family of Nassau, was not onely famous for Arms, but had been generally renowned for other excellnt Endowments of Peace; That it was their hope, he would embrace those Honours which should be attended by joy of all, and the teares of none, and that he would rather exect obedience from the Princes of the same blood then compell any to execrate his Greatness. But if he was best pleased with such Honour, as was gotten with the expence of sweat and blood, there were honourable Warres, wherein he might
advance his Standard against the Enemies of the name of Christ; so would his Prudence and Valour, arrive to that heighth of glory, as for the greatness and Honour of the Adventure, should ex∣ceed the ambition of the present Age. To which Prince Maurice, a few of the Deputies of the States being present, according to the usual Custom, made answer to this purpose. Wishing to God, that he might be so happy, as to set an end to these civill discords, both for the benefit of the present Age and Posterity; That he would account it more glorious, than the Name of a Conquerour, or then any Triumphed Garland. If therefore now at last, they were truly sensible of the smart of the Spaniards injurious dealing, they should then shew Courage suitable to their own Honour, and the greatness of their Ancestors; So it would come to passe, that Freemen with Freemen, might make what Agreements they pleased; That by coming into the League of Ʋnion, they were not only vindicators of liberty, but would be Companions of Kings whose Authority they were now op∣pressed under; Nor would the dissimilitude of Religion, be any greater obstacle to Concord, than it is now in France; But he would not prescribe any rule to them therein, the Judgement of Re∣ligion being to be left to God, and the several Nations professing the same; Between the United Provinces, and the other parts of the Netherlands, there are many things common, as antient Ally∣ances, right of consanguinity, and the Customs of the places: But between them and the King of Spain, all things were discordant and hostile, necessity continuing and increasing those things, which were begun at first, either to please his will or lust. That it was not possible for the Ʋnited States, to enter into Articles with that Enemy, whom they were forced to abandon, and renounce for their King, and indeed, such Covenants would not be called a peace, but a yielding; The malice of that Tyrannizing people is implacable, and there is no question to be made, how he would use his power is peace, who stretcheth it so in time of War. That time, and the i∣cissitude of Affairs, would bring many things to passe, which were but vain to hope for at present: But how should they ever give cre∣dit
to him, who thought it lawful to set to sale, the Heads of his most merited Enemies: That they would not rip up old sores, or  into President, former transactions: since all men remem∣bred his Father the Prince of Aurange, and himself. When Liesveldt, acknowledging himself to owe the Prince of Aurange all Honour and respect, began further to say, that is performance of Netherlandish Lords to him, neither they  the Spaniards, were consenting to those Counsels. The Prince, forewarned of his intent, putting his hand into Lies∣veldts bosom, he pulled out the Writings whereby Fontayne gave him license to come, thus by an evident demonstration, confuting specious words: Thus the Embassey was dismis∣sed, because they had not power of treating, unless in the Kings Name: This form of new answer, was variously de∣scanted upon, not onely by the Tongues of the vulgar, but of the more prudent sort part; of whom, got both Honour and Wealth, by the War, and the other part wished for peace onely, because they earnestly desired it. The Spaniards, and such as followed them, thought it was a sufficient offence against the Majesty of the King, if he to whom the care was committed, since these disastors sitting at the Helm, were called to treat upon their own accounts, should pardon them: What was the Event, say they, of such Embassies to the Union, but onely to make them more intol∣lerably proud; for having but from mean success gotten cou∣rage, they take the confidence, not onely themselves to shake off all Reverence and Obedience, but they instruct other Pro∣vinces to do the like, to enter into Treaties, and do any thing without the King: yes, they should go again and hear the rebellious Hollanders proposing Laws, whereby they would make themselves Conquerours of King Philip: And if it were hitherto doubted, yet now certainly it was manifest, that they despised, nay hated Peace.
And according to the Example of Switzerland, waiting if any others would throw off their Allegiance to their Prince Government, that they might grasp within their own fifts, There is but one kind of peace to be had with them, and that they must be compelled and beaten into by, Arms, and cer∣tainly that would not be long about, if the Netherlanders have no less courage for duty and obedience, then is in the Union to maintain the contrary. But others, and they of the moderator sort, would by no means, that peace, so far pro∣med, should now be lost; for what marvel is it, say they, if the Hollanders had rather yield to the rest of their Brethren of the Netherlands than the King, whom they, conscious to themselves, of their guilt towards him, dreads as a terrible revenger? That nothing was demanded contrary to Reli∣gion or Soveraignty, and the very particular concerning forreign Souldiers, was consonant to the desires of all, and is well advantagious to the War, as necessary for the Peace; That the Embassadors might be appointed, and instructed by the Kings Order, whose name soever was used in the sending them, and that the Netherlanders Fidelity was not so untry∣ed, as to suppose they would annihilate that Power by Ar∣ticles, for which they had so long maintained a War. That the Prince might far better connive at, and bear many things, then absolutely grant them. And if at last, expectation was not answered, it was lawful for the King to recede a little from the extremity of right for publick advantage; That be ought to cast an Eye of pitty upon their misery, and how ma∣ny people lay even at the last gasp ready to expire. That the fortune of the War had been various, which had been waged on this side by doing, on the other by suffering damage. Out Enemies have Pastures, Manufactures, and the Fishing-Trade, to maintain their vast number. And besides, whit is infinitely more then that, not onely Rivers and great floods, besides their efflux, and return thither as to their Head, but the boundless Ocean is traversed for ad∣vantage:
Hence is that multitude of strangers; and that whole Nations are included with their narrow bounds: They who rightly know them, say, 'tis necessary for them to have War. But on the other side of the Hispaniolized Netherlands, are robbed of the Stock of their Fields, have a dry shore, and dangerous to Shipping: yet are their burdens, and the scar∣city of all things, hardly to be remedied, or made amends for by any gain: Moreover, all places are made wast and ex∣hausted, and whatever remains, is never free from discords and trouble. It might be disputed indeed, whether Peace can be made; the same needs not be questioned as to War; At last, after all this, there was another fear added, lest the People of the United Provinces, vexed with the endless toyl of their mise∣ries, should choose a new Prince, wherein 'twas uncertain, whether they would admit a forreign Power, or content them∣selves with the Vertues and Valour of some Domestick; there was yet some hope, that a vacancy in the Common∣wealth should not be admitted; but if they once pitched upon a Prince, the War would either be inexplicable, or peace, if ever gotten, attained with loss and infamy. In these varieties of Judgment and Discourses, some there were, that applauded a Truce, averring. That the Hollander's Affairs stood hither too upright, by their Ʋnanimity and Con∣cord, and that their Concord was supported by Fear: These being once removed, the Vices of Equality would quickly succeed, and Emulation of Cities, which they could hardly restrain, even a∣mong all the dangers of War: In the interim, with people covetous of Wealth, there must be a Traffick of Minds; and the great ones being corrupted, the Commons (according to their Nature) begin∣ning once to love, would quickly cease to hate: Neither would they be willingly brought under the Burthen and Hazards of Warre again, if they were but once mollified by the immunity of some smal time of peace: In brief, the Word would quickly pass for Kings: The Hollanders being thus brought under, among whom is the
chief strength, Councel and obstinacy. It will be easte for Philip to determine, in what manner to order his Forces against the lace∣ated and torn Body of France, and the Womanlike Kingdom of Britaine, when that should onely support the War with consumed Wealth, and this fight only for fear. This Counsel was confirmed by Lipsius, with many ex∣amples out of antient History. However, Taxis believe the greatest damage would accrue to the Netherlands, under the Kings obedience by a Truce. Thus in variety of Opini∣ons, all things were destined otherwise than they happened, according to the Custom of Fortune, who being a great Ene∣my to humane Prudence, for the most part keepeth secret  future Events: But lest the People, all their hopes of Peace being utterly cut off, should run into Sedition, Rumours we scattered abroad, that the Treaty was prolonged, that thereby the Authority of Forreign Princes might intervene; And to that purpose, the Emperour sent Letters soon after, superscri∣bed to the States of Holland, which they received, and  in their General Assembly, whereto they returned this An∣swer. That they wished for Peace with their Neighbours, but had often declared why they could have no peace with the Spa∣niards: nor had any thing happened, which should cause them to alter their mind unless after the Kings sending poyson and assas∣sines to destroy them, they should therefore give credit to the Au∣thour of such monstrous and barbarous actions: And together with these Letters, they sent others to the Emperour, written by Taxis to Philip, and by them intercepted, wherein as he confessed it necessary for the Netherland States, to make a Composition with the United States, as it were, upon equall tearms, so that he would refer all things to Fontaynes pleasure, setting forth may Evasions, and first of a disswading, that neither the Spanish Souldiers should be sent away, nor the Germans admitted as Mo∣derators of Peace. In these parts this year, Philip Count Hohenlo, and George Eberhard, Count Solmes, were solemnly marryed, and their
Mariages celebrated, with Playes, Feasting, and publick Gifts. Hohenloes Wife was Mary; Count Solmes's, Sabina; this the Daughter of Lamoral Count Egmonde, that of the Prince of Aurange, both famous and well approved Matches,  well in regard of the great Merits of the Bridegrooms, as of the great Birth and Nobility of the Brides, both whose , as was yet fresh in memory, became Sacrifices for the liberty of their Country. Among all the mischiefs of Civil War, this War one, that the value of money was mightily inhansed, and every Nation had converted the use of raising the same, even into a matter of ; which some were of Opinion, to restore to an equal Standard, according to the Trades and Commodities of the Provinces. But of a sudden, even they who forbad that growing licentiousness, failed and give over the attempt. And there remain strong Arguments of an unsetled Society, better against the Enemy, than their consent and vanquished La agree among themselves. And besides, some Commo∣tions among their Neighbours, had made them attentive, who unless they were shut out by right, even loved to be in∣volved in a Neighbouring War, and making factions; for the Spaniards had openly declared their mindes and design; in claiming the Principalities of Cleves and Juilliers, as by the Minority and tender age of the former Prince, so by the sicknesse of his Son and Successor. The Government hereof, was snatched at on the one side by the Wife, a Woman of very insolent and shameless Conditions of the Family of Baden, and supported by the Austrian greatness: On the other side, by some Noblemen of the Country of Germany, as the Princes of Brandenburg and Newburg, who by their Wives, the Sisters of the Duke, took to themselves, the hope of so great an Inheritance; but altogether without the Em∣perours knowledge or consent, who when a male line is ex∣tinct, supposeth the right of bestowing those Principalities to be a new reverted to him.
These latter were favour'd by all the Protestants in those Regions, and by some Catholike also, who feated the Austria Families Pride, ever grievous to the Subjects, besides the vast Burthens of Tributes, with other Charges. These therefore using the Name of the States of Juilliers and Monts, they set free the Duke, who had been so inhumanely kept and hand∣led, that the grief thereof was believed to be no small me of increasing his Disease, and removed the Wife from the Guardianship, as one that endeavour'd mischief: In this i∣teim, Count Suartzenburge, hitherto a Follower of the Spa∣niards, was observed to List Souldiers in those Quarters, to go, as himself gave out, to the Turkish Warre; but others cceited it was to strengthen the Austrian Faction, it not being probable, that Forces which were to be used in the further part of Hungary, should be raised in the most distant part of Germany, as if they were purposely to be wasted and con∣med by a long March, after they had long been in pay to  purpose. But the Reverence of the German Empire, was the onely Obstacle that kept the Souldiers of Holland within compass and restrained their Incursions into the seatter'd and unprovided Country. At this time, the Elector of Brdenburgh, began to seek the Friendship and Alliance of the Ʋnited States. The same also did the Nobles of those Regi∣ons, desiring the Loan of a Sum of Money for a short time which would soon and easily be paid, when they had dra to themselves both the Government and Treasury. Some of the Hollanders would have speeded this; for by that means they should have peace with all those beyond the Rhine; and by the same Bond, their Armies and the French could quickly  joyned. Others, more prudently, averred, That so specio a pretence for War, ought not to be given to so potent  Enemy in those Dukedoms; That there come to take part, not onely those who affect the Spaniard in Cleves, but the Neighbouring Bishops and Priests also, when of Money would be as well wanting to those that craved help, as o
themselves; nor could it possibly be defended by their For∣ces, it being so far distant from them, and so scatter'd: Where∣fore they must wait, till their Minds and Forces grew meet to undertake such a business. At this time also, the City of Emblen had no less Troubles, a rich place scituate beyond the River Ems, into whose Mouth runs a little Rivulet: It is part of that Frized, which of old contained the Cauchi, an intermingled and broken Sore, possessed part by the Hollanders, part by the Danes; from whence that Region is now called East-Frizeland, be∣cause the antient Frizons on this Eemes, lye against it towards the West. Their Nature and Customs, were like the rest of the ; and, as to their Liberty, being left both by the French Kings, and the Emperours of Germany, when they could not bear Rule, they were content with any kind of Obedience. All publike Affairs were taken care of by Con∣tentions of the people divided, and sometime in common of  whole Nation: Judgments were given by some; choice , as well in their greater as in their lesser Assemblies▪ Among these, all such as possessed Lands or Farms were ∣ul; and he who possessed most, had most honour, and for that was onely accounted noble: But these, when they had lded Castles, and strong Holds, became not onely to them∣selves, but to others, a Succour and Refuge, both in Domestick and Foreign Wars, yea, and kept always in readiness a stan∣ding Force to repell any Injuries that should be offer'd to them. The Moderators of the Conventions and their Judges, who were their Defence against Factions, by little and little, ei∣ther through the Discords or Carelesness of the People; drew to themselves what they could possible; and when sometimes the memory of their Liberty returned to their Thoughts, they would fall into Civil Broils among them∣selves, to be revenged one upon another. Among these, the Imerge of Graithe became most notable by Marriages, Inhe∣ritances,
and injoyment of many Lands, which from Custom became a Jurisdiction; Thus, at first, the Dorpes of Em∣den were by him gotten, and afterwards growing more hardly from others, he took the Government of the Town being yet but mean: From this Off-Spring Ulderic, in the year 1454. first drawing privily to him others of the nobler sort, and un∣der-hand working upon the people, from the Emperour Fre∣derick, he took upon him the Rule of all that Tract of Land, which is stretched from the Eemes to the River Vueser, along by the Sea, by the Name of Earl, or Count, together withal Authority belonging thereto, as much as the Frizon Liberty would permit: And after ten years, he published certain Instuments in Writing, as Laws, but more contractedly that before, left the Rights of others, who began within those parts to grow ambitious, and to get honour by the same means, should be damnified. He moderated his Government with so much Benignity, either leaving or granting many Things to the people of Embden, and many Things to the Magistrates; and his Son Edsard, by adding more, grew  potent in the fidelity and love of his Subjects. that by the help he not onely hoped for the Dominion of Groeningen, and the Principality of the adjoyning Country, but also enjoyed and held the same, until the Saxons Arms, the Geldrians Re∣bellion; and lastly, the Austrian Violence, invading  things beyond the Eemes, ejected and threw him out to all. This man's Son, altogether unlike his Father, and so gover∣ning, that he himself needed to be govern'd by others, in short time left both his Life and Dominion. At which time when the Christian World began to be shaken with Disser∣tions about Religion, Embden following that Profession which in other Countries was sought after with Fire, and Sword, by the opportunity of the River, invited thither and maintained a great multitude of strangers, as well Dutch, as French and English. The Lady Anne of Oldenburg, was then
Governess in the name of another Edsard, her Son, using with great Civility and Moderation the growing Principa∣lity, and not according to the Custom of German Princes. She bore a great Reverence to the study of Religion and the Laws, which she judged not so much a safeguard to Liberty, as Authority: By this place of Refuge, together with her mildness and sweet behaviour, it is almost incredible, how much this City increased, containing therein no less than six Thousand: Soon after this follow'd all the Vices usual pre∣dominant in a flourishing people; as among them Pride and Luxury; among the Magistrates, and those in Authority, En∣vy and Emulation: Nor was it yet come to the height of force, so long as John, a younger Brother of Edsard, by counsel or fear, being of a mild nature, restrained his Bro∣thers more furious Disposition: But John being dead, Ed∣sard differing in Religion from the Townsmen (for he held the Augustane Confession, and the Town owned the Disci∣pline of Geneva) began more and more to have in Suspition the Townsmens Felicity: His Wife descended of the Royal Stock of Sweden, and a Regal Inclination increased the Dif∣ference; and, among other things, this was related as one cue, That she detained to her own use some parcels of Houshold∣stuff borrowed of the Townsmen under this pretence, that it exceed∣ed the Rank of private men. Now by the instigations of those, who our of design of novelty, either flatter'd the Prince or People, a dangerous Contention arose, and came to that heighth, that the Earl interpreted the Assemblies and places of Meeting devoted to Religious Uses, Conventicles of Se∣dicious persons, and with the Collections of Money, which the City made out of a pure intent of Charity to relieve the poor, he gave out, they designed to raise Force against him: But on the other side, a troublesom sort of Tumultuous per∣sons crying out for Liberty, and (which is the most violent perswasive of all) Religion, being ignorant of all Civill Customs and Law, onely turbulent under that pretence of
Religion, oftentimes do pervert a good cause by ill manag∣ing. The unconquer'd Valour of their Progenitors, and the fresh and near Example of the Hollanders with the Frizons were mention'd: And what could they do more honourably, than to unite themselves into antient Name and League of those most valiant Nations? Now the Earl imposed Tributes and Burthens upon Merchandizes; now he so minds Af∣fairs, that he imposed Magistrates upon them of his own no∣mination: Hitherto the People's Rage and Fury, though fierce and obstinate, yet vented it self no other ways than in words; but when they saw a Garrison in the Castle, they threw off both at once Shame and Delay; and forthwith, un∣de a private person, their Leader run, to Arms; they assault the Court, the Gates, and all other strong places in the City: Neither did they onely choose Collonels and Captains, but by the worst of Presidents, they set up new Magistrates, de∣posing them, who withdrew themselves from the Troubles, in regard of the Oath taken to their Prince: The Keepers of the Castle were compelled, through Hunger, to desert the same; and all things being thus forcibly seized, they imme∣diatly, without any Dispute, resolved to court the help of the United Provinces: Both Parties dispatch Legates to the Hague, to agree with the States: Those accused the rude and unruly multitude of Sedition, in whose Revenge and Exam∣ple, the States were concerned, who flourish'd in Concord; and if Authority should thus be despised by the Vulgar, it would be to the injury of all Superiours. These, on the con∣trary side, called to mind the Hatred of sincere Piety, violati∣on of the Laws, unjust Taxations & a Dominion obtain'd by Arms and Faction; as if they demanded of the States, Whe∣ther they thought such Things tollerable: And they humbly desired, That they would have compassion on their Associats, both in Religion and suffering: They added further, That its Count had endeavoured the Friendship, both of the Pope, and King Philip, by whose assistance he would oppress their Liberty,
and receiving Possessions other where, deliver up the City to the Spa∣niard as a Gift. And they were well informed by Spies, that the Enemy placed the main strength of his War therein, if he could but attain the River, and well-contrived Port, and indeed there is hardly any River more desireable, than that of the Eemes, which running into the Bay of Dullart, divides the Territories of Embden, from the Jurisdiction of Groenin∣gen, and from the midst thereof, dischargeth it self into the Ocean with a large opening, capable of Ships of the greatest Burthen, and very safe by the interposition of several Islands; among which, its passage is somewhat incurvated; and this would make it easie for the Spaniard, to raise a new War in Frizeland, and to set forth a Navy to Sea, which hitherto in these parts, he could never attain to. The Ʋnited States, who foresaw as well the Danger, as the Envy, if they should be resisted, dispatch'd away an Embassie with so much policy, as should neither cause the Earl to lay aside all fear of them, nor the People too confidently hpe their Alliance: They commended Peace to boh, and if it seem'd convenient, they might, according to Law, decide the matter; for their taking up Arms, was but a greater cause of Suspition: That now they were Enemies to neither party, but if further Contentions did arise, they would declare them∣selves such, in particular, to them that began the War: But when News was hastned by speedy Messengers, relating, That Enno, the Son of Edsard, had levyed Souldiers, and was fortisying Port-Knocken, over against Delphezyle, straightway the number of Ships, which were wont to guard the Eemes, was increased, and a Regiment of Frizons commanded to match toward the City for the defence thereof, and to drive from the Bank those new Undertakers; And the City also o∣verjoy'd, as if thereby secure, deliver'd both it self, and its Fortunes, to the protection and warlike defence of the Ʋni∣ted Provinces: Neither, at that time, did any thing advantage Edsard, more than to make them Arbitrators of the Quarrel,
by whose power all things were managed. He offer'd them also a League and Alliance in Arms, fearing lest the City might anticipate him of that favour. But it will not be amiss to commemorate what manner of peace the Arbiters sent by the States to Dlphzyle made, and the chief Heads or Arti∣cles thereof; That as they judged in the Affairs of Embden, so Posterity may judge of them. The Heads of the said Agr∣ment were these: That Religion should not be a Net for any one; That within the City, the same Religious Rites should be used as were accusto∣med; but without the City, the Earl was at liberty to use his own Religion; That in all Religious Meetings, onely matters of Di∣vinity should be handled, some one super-intending the same, if the Senate please to nominate him, as is usual in the Palatinate, and among the Hollanders, that under pretence thereof, no disturbance might be made; That the said Religious Assemblies, should no∣minate and ordain all Ministers for Preaching, but the Prince's approbation to be required therein; that the Possssions belonging late to Religious persons, should be equally divided between the Earl and the People; That four of the Burgomasters, and nine of the chief Assistants by Lot should have the chief Authority, the other by order every year being changed and altered, none continuing in power above two years, lest they seek to gain the Soveraignty; That the Senate should name two in the places of any departing, of which the Earl to choose one, although he used before, according to his own will, to create what Magistrates he pleased; That all busi∣ness, either relating to the City or Sea, should be ordered by these: As the incorporating the City into Guilds and Fraterni∣ties for the better distinguishing the pople the keeping the Kyes of the Gates, and giving the Watch word to the Guads: They had likewise the power of giving Judgment in Civil Affairs; as also to punish with Death, as they saw cause: They that were guilty of more heinous Crimes, being Strangers, were punished by judges, appointed by the Prince; That the Senate it self (which consiste
of fourty men) should, by its own choice and suffrages, supply it self; and such as were admitted into honourable places, should take an Oath of Allegiance to the Prince, and likewise for the good Administration of Justice in the City; That such Laws and Tributes should be confirmed onely, as were agreeable with the an∣tient and municipal Law, so as every City separably might have the ordering of its own Revenues: But Falder being a new City added to the old, and so more conformable in their Duty to the Earl, should, for the future, enjoy the same Priviledges with Embden, to take off all occasion of future Discord; And that the Citizens might be the better assured of Pardon, the Earl should take away the threatning Terrour of his Castle, and deliver it to the City, and for the future should not keep them in awe by Forts built upon the Banks of the River, such as came thither with Merchandize: For all which Concessions of the Prince, the City would make to him a Compensation, with a great Summe of Money. Thus were the People's Desires gratified by Securi∣ty, and the Prince's. by Greatness: Nor did the Co∣venants displease either, though yet they were found fault with by malitious and upstart People: However, it was concluded, That all future Earls and Magistrates should swear to this Peace. Things there being in this manner setled, The States ad∣vised the Earl, that he would mollifie and sweeten all jealou∣sies and offences with clemency, lest the Spaniard esteeming a counterfeit friendship, before a reall fidelity, should at once compel him to treacherous actions, and engage him in a War with his Neighbours; The Citizens of Embden like∣wise, were commanded to apply their endeavours to the pat∣tern of their Neighbours, and not by casting off their obedi∣ence, to encrease their miseries; That a civil War was well redeemed with a little servitude; for even they themselves
(the States) have suffered and born the more furious natures of their Princes, so long as foreign Tyranny was kept away. Hereupon, the Souldiers on both sides being disbanded, qui∣etness might rather be said restored than concord; for the wound of dissention was not so perfectly cured, but that as it often festered anew, so it was fain to seek fresh Reme∣dies. This year, and the subsequent time for a while, all the Af∣fairs of the United Provinces to War, proved unsuccesful, as if by a short contempt of their plyant fortune: The whole Spring, and part of the Summer, was spent by them in idleness, onely some few of their Souldiers warring in France; but their own discords hindred the motions of their Forces in Other places, though often called upon by Buzenual, for Suc∣cour. For the Frizon Cities, being malitious to the Country∣man, and by the rustick likewise hated, complained, that the burthens common to them both, were not faithfully distribu∣ted, for that many things of great profit in the Country, were either partially remitted, or totally omitted. And they of Zeland, did very sharply quarrel with the Hollanders, con∣cerning the Customs for exported Merchandise, and by this means, a long time deferred to pay their Tribute money into the Treasury of the Union; They also of Geldres and Over-Issell, excusing themselves by poverty, growing from the E∣nemies continual incursions, at last the Hollanders too, who bear at least two third parts of the common charge of the League, took example, either to imitate or revenge the hu∣mour: For if men follow after their profit, nor more out of necessity, than Wisdom or Policy, while the Enemies Af∣fairs were very unprosperous, and themselves had most ad∣vantagious Trading, and the French War raging, that time certainly, called for their more vigorous endeavours, and not to cast off all to a season, when the people being more impo∣verished, must, through the mercies of unprosperous events, yet run the hazards, and bear the burthen and heat of the day.
Neither did the successes in Lutzenburg, answer expectati∣on; for though several Forts and Castles were assaulted rashly and taken, yet neither was the Enemy much damnified, or the Victors any thing advantaged thereby. But after King Henry by making a great Progress in Burgundy, had drawn thither the Forces of his Kingdom, the Earl of Bulloyns For∣ces being exhausted, who by an ostentous defiance, had brought the Spanish Army against him, he was not onely not able to perform his threats, but also unable to defend himself, he saw the French Borders pillaged, himself being only able to assist them with a helpless and sorrowful look; By the irksomness whereof, and because the Souldiers began to grow insolent, through hunger and thirst, having nothing but wa∣ter to drink, Philip of Nassau, much against the Earl of Bul∣loyns will, made hast to return, but by a contrary way to that, he went out, for that the Enemy had blocked up. But the Foot being commanded to go back, by the way where France is encompassed by the Sea, that so they might sail into Hol∣land, himself with the Horse came into Gelderland, through Germany. And Fontayne, by how much he held a spited Go∣vernment, by so much be the more earnestly studied, that his Adversaries might have no cause to accuse him for any thing besides his greatness; His chief care was for the Souldiers, to strengthen the old, and to recruit them with a new Mili∣tia, and well knowing the Revolt of the Italians, and whate∣ver miseries followed thereupon, was accounted his fault, for the mitigating the envy he had contracted, he supposed to re∣duce them to obedience, would be his readiest way: where∣fore hastning the conclusion of the Agreements, begun by Ernestus, but interrupted and broke off by his death, in re∣gard monies did not yet arrive, he gave them pay from day to day, and pledges for performance of what was agreed; Not∣withstanding which, being Commanded to take possession of Tilemonte, they refused to follow their Colours; yet they made an advantage of it, averting the use of those Souldiers,
which they themselves wanted, even against the Enemy; and shortly after, divided them, some under new Officers, others into Garrisons. The King of Spain's Forces were hardly at any time greater, or more numerous than now, yet being far dispersed in several parts, were never able to compass any great mat∣ter; In Burgundy, under Velasius, was a strong Army: In the Confines of Artois and Picardy, after the departure of Charles Mansfield Varembonius was quartered, to bridle Cam∣bray, and by making excursions into France, to revenge Ra∣pine by Rapine. Mondragonio attended Prince Maurice, to observe his motions, and in time to meet or prevent him. In this lying about Hulst, there were four thousand Armed men. Verdugo with six thousand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horse, being Commanded, drew near to Ferte, to drive the Earl of Bulloin, who had less Forces, out of Lutzenburg, and to recover the Towns by him taken. The Walls of this Town of Fert, by continual Batteries, and breaches, lay open, yet a great power of the French, be∣ing sent to help the Town by a fierce and violent Assault, did repress and beat off the Besiegers; But this Town thus freed from the Siege, being soon after by accident, for the greatest part burned and spoyled by Gunpowder, by the Earl of Bul∣loyne himself, was dismantled and ungarrisoned. In the inte∣rim, Verdugo turning his strength against weaker places, after a few Assaults, by a growing Disease, and the accomplish∣ment of his Fate, dyeth, report also being both doubtful and suspicious about his death: for he merited a name of Ho∣nour, although in the unsuccesful Government of Frizeland, as rather wanting opportunity and strength, then Valour and Industry. He was faithful to the heighth of Religion, and elo∣quent beyond the mode of a Souldier; His nature was full of urbanity, and thereby easily distinguished from other Spa∣niards, who generally do not use so prayse-worthy a quality,
and because he was raised from nothing, to great Honours, being born of a House not ignoble, though impoverished, he remembred his former Fortune, as much as was ne∣cessary. The Cities of the Netherlands, made it their general Re∣quest to Fontayne at last, that he would stick close to the Siege of Cambray, offering him a great sum of money, and also Souldiers, because while neither the City was closely be∣sieged, nor the Spanish Army reduced thereto from their ly∣ing scattered up and down, they were spoiled by both; But he of his own accord, that the time of his Government might not passe away without something memorable, and that be might supply the empty Treasury, he sends to Varembonius his Camp, and increaseth his Forces, to make them up twelve thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse; With this Army, he secured all the adjacent parts from the French, and that done, he took Castellat, being first much weakened by Batte∣ry, and afterwards forced them to surrender, who had re∣treated into the Castle. This is a Town in Vermandois, near the Head of the Scheldt, which another Henry King of France, had appointed for a defence to Cambray; and if any invasion should hap∣pen out of the Netherlands, for a frontire Guard to the King∣dom. About the same time, Hanen a Town in the same Bor∣ders, was taken by force, with such variety of chances, as have made the Relation wonderful, and brought it almost within the compass of fabulous. The Governour thereof was one Gomero, one Of those Frenchmen, who under pretence of the Roman Religion, had sought to win foreign favour to his advantage. This man, at what time the greatest Affairs in those parts were turned against the King of France his For∣tune, Covenanting with the Spaniards, for a great sum of money, delivered up the Town, only retaining the Castle, while the Articles were performed; But by the Policy of
Fontayne, drawn out, he was overcome, together with his two Brothers: his Mother, and his Kinsman, Orvillier, still remained to the Garrison, with the danger of which dearest Pledges they were threatned, unless they forthwith de∣parted. The Woman between fear and affection, consented; but Orvillier, being nearer to the incensed French, by secret Messengers, sent to the Earl of Bulloyne, and the rest of the Kings Commanders, who then resided in Picardy, who com∣ing, and being admitted into the Castle, all the whole day after, there was a sharp conflict with the Towns, wherein there were twelve hundred Souldiers Spaniards, Walloons, Germans, and Italians, nor was the Dispute ended, without the loss of some Noble Blood; for Humerius a great Soul∣dier, well experienced in the Art of War, and beloved of the King, was slain: At last, they hewed out their passage by fire and Sword, and they who with Orvillier, survived the Fight, were delivered for Pledges, according to Agreement, to prevent the Spaniards threatnings; But the Captives, by the treachery of their Keepers breaking Prison, brought the Castle into that danger, that they were fain to be discharged by Articles. Thus by Orvillier's want of Courage, the French obtained the Castle, which he had resolved before to keep for himself; And Fontayne, because the Town being taken, he came too late, changing his fame into fury, brought the Governour before the Walls, even ready to die under the hands of the Executioner; There he in a weeping tone, now beseeches his Mother, then his friend, if they had any mercy, any con∣sideration of his blood, that they would not imagine while he stood under the stroke of death, to raise to themselves Trophies of Honour and Dignity; And when they answer∣ed, that it was not in their power, because the French pos∣sessed both the Town and Castle, he was immediately strang∣led before their faces.
Let these mens unhappy examples be a warning to others, and make them know, that they who follow several sides, by a wavering Judgment, make themselves be esteemed Ene∣mies by both. From thence the Enemy proceeded to Dorlens, that so Cambray might be compassed behind, it having been in vain, and without, success, attempted about that time, by the trea∣chery of some Priests, and of the Townsmen. Here while Valentine Pardieu Lamot, was viewing the place, and ob∣serving the Fortifications by Moon-light, he was killed with a Bullet-shot from the Town. This was the first of all the Commanders, who had for∣merly foreseen the discord of the States in the greatest Af∣fairs and the increase of the Spaniards Wealth; He was eminent in vertue, and more than ordinarily skilful in Mili∣tary understanding and Policy, manifesting what he ought to be, that will, as he did, from a common Souldier, come to be General of the Ordinance, Governour of the Town of Graveling, and attaining great Wealth, had the name and Honour of an Earl. The Count Bulloyne had sent into the City a Garrison, and soon after, he himself, together with the Count St. Paul, came thither to bring both Gunpowder, and other Provision and Ammunition. But Villars, the Commander of the Van-Guard (this Villars had by King Henries Command, the charge of all that Coast by the Sea side) while he, greedily desirous to fight, contemned the Command of his Superi∣ours, being circumvented, and taken by Fontains Army, was, together with many other Noblemen thereabout, slain, be∣cause he had revolted from the Guisian League, to King Henry: (this day was then, by chance, the Feast of Saint James the Apostle, which the Spaniards look upon as a very lucky day to them, and often by such belief make it so) the rest got off, Fortune giving a Pardon to the errour of both parties; for if the French had joyned Battel with greater
Forces, which then the Count Nevers had raised, both the way into the City, and the place had layn open to them for Victory. And the Spaniard, if he had followed his Fortune, had put the French to flight, and there would have been little difference between this Battel, and those of Paugo and St. Quintins: the Conquerour assailed the Castle, which was ill defended; for the Governour of the place, Gamache, while according to the fashion of the time, he consulted rather his own safety than the Kingdoms, out of twelve hundred Frenchmen which he had with him, he took onely a few of such as he could confide in into the Castle, leaving the rest in the Town, that they might be ready, if any necessity did accrue, which proved to be his ruine; for some of the Spa∣niards being sent to review the breach made in the Castle by the Cannon, when they perceived it deserted, testifying their joy by a sudden shout, they drew more of their Com∣pany to them, who breaking into the Castle, they pursued their opportunity so close, as they likewise at the same time entred the Town; when death and slaughter raged without controul, for where Valour could not defend the Armed men, mercy nothing prevailed for the safety of the un∣armed. Now while the Army wearied with these Affairs, rested themselves in French Garrisons, towards the latter end of Summer, Prince Maurice drawing together the Souldiery that had remained with himself, and those other Regiments returned with Philip of Nassau, for Service, and minding to gain those few places which the Enemy yet held about Frizeland, sat down before Groll, a Town in the Territory of Zutphen. The Garrison consisted only of six hundred men, there were but few great Guns in the Town, and no store of Provision for a long Siege; and besides, the Well or Ditch that supplyed it with water, was easily to be drain∣ed, or dryed up. And these things were the main causes of the Princes hopes.
This design being understood by Mondragonio, who with a flying Brigade marching out of Antwerp, infested all the Garrisons in his way, beyond the Maes and the Rhine; he had about five thousand Foot, and about a thousand Horse; but e much multiplying their number, Prince Maurice, though he had twice as many in his Army, distrusting Provi∣sion, leaving the Siege, and burning what they could not carry away, marched to the Issell, intending to stay for the Enemy within Germany; But Mondragonio, not daring to adventure upon his Camp, but content to have raised the Siege from Grolle, and not to have broken the mutual quiet∣ness of the year, retreated: keeping the River Luppe for his safeguard against the Enemy: For Prince Maurice followed him, being now satisfied, that he came not with so great an Army, as had been reported: He sent therefore beyond the River, Philip of Nassau, with five hundred Horse, suddenly to fall upon the Enemies Cavallery, as they lay dispersed and graing. But Mondragonio receiving unquestionable Intelli∣gence of these directions from some Renegadoes, sent into the same place all his whole strength of Horse; Philip, as soon as ever he was come out of the narrow wayes, into the open Champayne, was presently inclosed, and they in the Rear not able to give any help, themselves also being in∣tangled, as in the confused violence of their flying Came∣rdes, so also in the straightness and lubricity of the way, but as the fortune of the fight between the Horse near at hand, was ambiguous, by the endeavours of some that violently broke in upon them, the Enemy was at a non-plus. But the Commanders being unserviceable, by reason of their wounds, quickly abated their Courage; some remain∣ing yet intire, freshly set upon the troubled Enemy, but the greater part fled even to the River Luppe, upon whose Bank on the other side, the Prince stood ready with his Army to receive them.
This slaughter was neither great nor memorable, for any other thing than this, That the men of greatest Quality  Command, bore the greatest share in the misfortune;  Philip of Nassau himself, while he most strenuously m∣tained the Fight, being first wounded, then taken Prison soon after, among the signall respects of his Neighbours,  Counts of Heremberg, he yielded up the Ghost. The fulness of his Spirit was not to be daunted, having form been very succesful in War, wherein 'tis probable, he had  miscarryed, if the fervency of his mind had by age been  within bounds. In this Fight also was slain Ernestus one of the Count  Solmes: But Ernestus of Nassau, Philips Brother, rans himself; and after all, the dead Bodies were buried: ther did any thing else happen, while the Armies lay  and each attended the others motion and Counsels, so sping the Autumn, and more secure times of the year;  that Prince Maurice his men attempting Mursa by a No∣nall Stratagem, and being come to the Trench, while  cut down the Palizadoes that stopped them there, the day ∣pearing, they were forced to retreat; At length, M∣gonio first drew off to Winter Quarters, not able any lo to bear the incommodious season for War: he was a Com∣mander of ninety years of Age, who coming to command Army, then publickly ready to fall into Sedition, fo means to prevent that growing evill, by sending part of  beyond the Maes; and keeping the rest on this side the ver he not only repressed their madness, but separated  Counsels; Nor did the Prince prolong the time much  him. Immediately after this, Mondragonius, by his de helped to encrease the Funeral Solemnities of that year, be∣ing a very old Souldier, and continually in the War,  the first beginning thereof in Alva's time, to his end;  knew how to order and rule the Souldiery, as well by Policy
thority; and there are scarcely so many, and so famous  of any of those great Commanders, who were his Predi∣ors, to be remembred, as there are of him; no to forget  felicity, that being never timorous of danger, but al∣wayes desirous of Honour, he had yet arrived to very old , having never received any wounds; The Duke of trana dyed also, known only by the Nobility of his Ex∣pect and nothing else. This Year also, Don Antonio deceased, who formerly dri∣ out of the Kingdom of Portugall, by the Spanish Ar∣ under the Duke of Alva's Conduct, when he might have raised Factions, not quite drooping both in Africa, Italy,  other places possessed by the Spaniard, yet fled for Re∣ to France and England, and in vain placed his hopes upon the mercy and Charity of Christian Princes; yet refu∣sing the Ayd divers times offered to him by the Turks, and  Moors, which he would have the World believe he did  of Piety: his Friends reported that he was poysoned, because he would not be wrought upon to confer his right of ym in that Kingdom to Philip, notwithstanding all the great promises of Moneys and Honours made by Philip to . In these varieties of Fortune, Fontayne was not long at rest, but set forth against Cambray, nor did the reason of his hope to attain the same, appear in publick; however, many of the Netherlandish Nobility attending, and several French Commanders, who disdained the pardon of their own Prince, and also the Souldiers after the spoyl of Dorleus, being greedy of a greater booty, and moved with the intreaties of the Neighbouring Cities offering them money, in a manner, com∣pelled them to shut up all the Avenues into, or out, of the Town, and, under the shew of a Siege, to wait for an oppor∣tunity of enterprising somewhat.
And King Philip himself had written to him, that it was a dishonourable act, that a strong Hold erected as a boundary by his Father, should be left in the Enemies hands: Incited therefore by all these Reasons, they were necessitated to hope well of that, which they could no way avoid; Barlat drove the Besieged from their outer Works, from thence they began Mines, Batteries, breaches, and other both Clandestine and open Stratagems were used, but the great and notable strength of the French, ready to receive their Assault, yet ter∣rified them; for Gonzaga, the Count of Nevers his Son, had by the Command of his Father, brought thither a hun∣dred, and soon after, other five hundred conducted by the Horse, through unguarded places, in the dawning of the morning, came in to their assistance; Then also was it found by a noble example, how dangerous it is to be feared of many, and that there is no Guard strong enough to uphold a Dominion, which is contrary to the peoples liking, where the greater danger arising from fear, quickly moves to an∣ger. For Balagny, that he might strengthen by force, his un∣just power, imposed Tributes, and grievous Guards, and all other things usual in a Tyranny, which drew upon him the hatred of the multitude; and at last, turned him out of all; Nor was Fontayne wanting privily to inslame their minds already disturbed, sometimes by Religion, otherwhile by fear, and anon by money: by which means, before the Ene∣my got to the Trench, all the common people being gather∣ed together from all parts, with whom joyned the Switzer Souldiers, by reason of divers private injuries, and also be∣cause Balagny commanded Brass money to be given them in pay, instead of Gold and Silver, but at if he would have re∣deemed the same; which kind of fact, hath in some places been allowed for liberty sake, but never was admitted to be given to the Souldiers for pay; all which things were now urged to Fontayne, treating with them
Neither did the Articles of Surrender contain many Heads; for the Spaniard's were easily admitted, for fear of the French; although they now must suffer more from them, than from the French whom they turn'd out: And they that reti∣red into the Castle, staid not to expect a Battery, or any other Assault. And now appeared many Examples of the Spaciard's cru∣elty, though the Surrender of the Town was concluded, un∣less the King of France, within six days, sent them new Re∣lief; whereof he failing, the Town was accordingly deliver∣ed, and the Souldiers sent safe away, Balagny himself depart∣ing from his usurped Command, but as a private man, even prosecuted by the French, he very ill deserved that Fortune, which had been to him favourable enough; because a long time, deceiving both parties, and being faithful to neither, he had sometimes received Money and Provisions from the French, sometimes from the Spaniard, yea and from the Ʋnited States themselves; and a little before the Siege, he sold all the Victuals necessary for the City, giving out, that the Soul∣diers necessity required it, although the Customs he recei∣ved must needs be great; for that he kept in his own hands all Offices both Civil and Sacred: His Wife was a Woman of a Masculine Spirit; for while any hope remained, she her¦self would look to the Watches and Guards, help to carry Turf, to Traverse the Cannon, to oversee the Corporals, and, in short, to perform all the Duty both of a good Captain, and a good Souldier: Nay, she attempted the common people with a Largess; which Things proving all in vain, she ac∣knowledged, that it was her unlucky Fate; yet would she not indure to leave her Dominion to the Enemy, or own her Life as received from their Mercy; for the same day where∣in the Covenants for Surrender of the Castle, were conclu∣ded, she dyed of Grief, or rather took something to hasten the same: Now were the Images of Alencon and Balagny thrown down, and forthwith an Oath exacted from the
Townsmen (Richardot, being skilful in the Forms thereof, con∣trived it,) as if the City had been to have continued for ever under the Spanish Obedience. For, at that time, the Princes of Burgundy and Austria, had, under pretence of Guardianship, usurped the antient Right of the Counts of Alost; and by that Title, the Emperour Charles Erected a Castle in the City, that it might not again Revolt to the French. But F∣tayn, with his Armed Power, soon decided the Controversie of Right, and commanded to swear Obedience to Philip as their Prince; saying before the Siege, That it was convenient, when Treating with Lewis Barlaymont Bishop of that City, he urged him, to rest contented with the Sacred Function, and to as∣sign to the Spaniard his Right of Dominion; which had ever belonged to the Bishop, under a Tye of Reverence to the Im∣perial Majesty of Germany. Nor did Barlaymont, notwith∣standing the said Oath, cease to demand his due and antient Right, the Townsmen all endeavouring the same, though to no purpose, reaping no other Fruit of their vain Labour, but Hatred; for the Spanish keeping the Castle, forbore no so of Licentiousness, whereby it came to pass, that the Trade of Linnen Cloth, the greatest gain and advantage the City enjoy'd, was carryed thence into the Neighbouring Towns: And the Italians being intreated by Fontayu to assist the Siege, when the City being taken, as they did return to pos∣sess Tilemont, they valiantly set upon some Troops of Hollan∣ders which they met, and then first of all gave a proof both of their Fidelity and Courage in War. But the Honour of the Mauritian Horse was quickly repair'd, by an Irruption into Weert, a Town in the County of Horn, where they took Henry one of the Counts of Heremberg, prisoner, and afterward dis∣comfited the Convoy, that was guarding thither Provisions. But Weert, lying at too great a distance from their Confines, was again presently deserted: But Heraugier, grown experi∣enced by practice, that in making many Attempts, Fortune will sometimes favour one or other of them, studied to repair
the loss of Hoye, with the taking of Liere. It is a Town which the Spaniards formerly got by Treachery, and a Victory cruel enough at the little River of Neths, scituate in the mid∣dle between Antwerp and Mechlin, and serves them both of∣tentimes to great advantage: Hither were men invited on all hands by Heraugier, with the hope of prey; the Ensigns in the Twilight climbing up with Ladders over the Walls, fall upon the ignorant and unprovided Watch, killing them: Then the Gates are opened, the Foot enter, and a few of the Horse, in all about a Thousand, culled men out of Breda, and other Garrisons thereabouts, and, without all peradventure, might have kept the place, if there had been as much Valour and Obedience shew'd in defending it, as there was Industry & Policy in getting it. Alphonsus Luna was the Governor, who not being abashed, or faltting in Courage, at the first Shock in the Town, placeth his Souldiers, and as many of the People, as on a suddain could be got together, in the Market-place, and before the Court: Anon mistrusting those strengths, he went to the Gate that was behind the Enemy in the way to Lonuayn: But the Conquerours, who were altogether secure, dispersed themselves, some into the Churches, others into the Houses; but all to Rapine, Plunder, and Licentiousness: Thus they spent the greatest part of the day within the Walls; nor could Heraugier, either by Reverence to his Commands, or by Intreaties or Threatnings prevail, that so many of the Soul∣diers would come to their Colours, as might drive away that small party from the Gate: In the interim, Soccours and Re∣lief were sent to Luna out of the next Garrisons, among whom, a great Company of Citizens of Antwerp, and some few Spaniards out of the Castle. Heraugier seeing this, cau∣sed the Gate, whereat he and his men entred, to be shut up, that thereby he might necessitate them to fight: But for all that, these Straglers would neither mind their own, nor their Enemies Forces; onely so much was their fear now, because they were in no fear before: And for that there was no other
way to go out, and they that were first kill'd, stopped up that against those that follow'd; some of them leaped headlong from the Rampire into the Trench; others were slain amongst the people, and a great number both of Men and Horse taken: The Captain, and such as were skilful in swimming, got safe away. And herein the Deliverers of the Town shew a great Example of singular Continence; for that whatever was found among the prey, that belonged to the Townsmen, was care∣fully restored to the Owners. During all these Vicissitudes of Affairs, both the Spanish and French Armies follow'd the War in Burgundy, with grea∣ter preparation than event. Of old, the Aedui, famous for their Alliance with the Romans, and the Sequani, both Na∣tions of Gaul, possessed that Territory; into whose possession shortly after, when the Romane Empire was torn in pieces, the Burgundians succeeded a people coming out of the North, but setled some time before in the nearer parts of Germany. These extended their Dominion a large compass, both on this side, and beyond the River Saone, even to the Name and Greatness of a Kingdom, but was first diminished by the French Grandeur, and afterwards, in a manner quite oblite∣rated: From thence those parts were sometimes given to Friends, but more often appointed to the French King's Sons, while that Empire could be divided, the Kingly Honour reserved: After this, all that Region almost which the Aed possessed, was Erected into a Dukedom, and that of the Se∣quani into an County or Earldom. After the death of Charles the Bold, Lewis of Valois, the 11th of that Name King of France, took the Dukedom from Mary, the Daughter of Duke Charles, pretending the Succession of that Government could not devolve to the Female Line: But the County or Earldom, which began to be subject to Germany, as soon as it was an Empire, after the Marriage of Maximilian with Mary, was claimed and held by the House of Austria. At this time, cer∣tain French Commanders, advised King Henry, That he should
invade the Spaniard on that part, where he lay most open to be  and damnified; and that by this means, the Spaniard's pas∣sage out of Italy into France, or the Low-Countries, would be  up, and the right due to his Ancestors be regained. The ter was at first begun by inferiour Captains, and little Par∣ties: But when King Philip, fearing the danger, had sent Velasco, as we before mention'd, from Millayn, which he then govern'd, to Burgundy, with Ten Thousand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horse, that strength of the Enemy first brought thither Biron, and after that the King himself. In many light and accidental Skirmishes of Horse, the French went off Victor; And Velasco avoided a Pitch'd-Battel, desi∣ring to preserve the Towns. In the Dutchy of Burgundy, King Henry subjected to his Power the City of Dijon, which in the last Civil War of France follow'd the Guisian Faction, then headed by the Duke de Mayn, to whom there was nothing left Fortified in that Dukedom, but Chalons sur la Saone. But when he began to prosecute his Victory, into the Bounds of the County, or Earldom, the Switzers interceded him to re∣spite his Fury; because being bound at that time by Leagues to the House of Austria, they were obliged to resist all Force that should be offer'd, either to the Government of Millain, of the County of Burgundy: Whereupon King Henry took occasion, by means of a Truce, to withdraw his Army with∣out any dishonour, he himself being even tyred out with the Controversie, and the thing it self contended for, not being worth so many lives. And also, being sollicited by Cambray, he marched that way, when a sorrowful Messenger met him with the News of the loss of the City: Therefore he accu∣sed his Allies, That he himself being employ'd in Wars at so great a distance, they had betrayed to the Enemy the Confines both of France and the Netherlands; That they gave him other hopes, that his Borders should not be left destitute of Aid, else why should he so often have refused Conditions of Peace, when offered to him; And if they repented them of their League, that he was yet
ready to agree with the Spaniard. The Hollanders excused themselves to these Taunts, with the necessities of that year and furnished the King with Corn and Money, and two Re∣giments of men, the one of Scots, the other of Zelanders, un∣der the Leading of Justine of Nassau; wherewith being well Recruited, he fell into Vermandois; and careful, that where he had now begun, the Enemy might not break further into the Bowels of the Country, the people of Soissons being sub∣dued, he shut up Fayer with a difficult and Winter-Siege: But by how much the States more earnestly endeavour'd to please the King, by so much more grievously they offended Queen Elizabeth; for King Henry's prosperity, in stead of pity, had renewed in the English Nation their old Envy, and the Queen was incensed with the difference of his Religion, especiall for that she knew, what Laws, and how dangerous to the Protestants, the Pope had prescribed to King Henry, for the obtaining his Peace. And this was the Reason, that lately before upon his desi∣ring of her four Regiments of men, for whose Pay the City of Paris should ingage their Credit. The Queen answer'd, That it was an inconsiderate Desire proceeding from his Youth, to request her to denude her Kingdom, which was ed at by so many Treasons; yet if he would deliver to her, Diope, Bulloin, and Calais, she would furnish him with some Souldiers. This gave suspition to the French; and besides, there was added, that lately in Bretaign, a Province of France, the Eng∣lish were unworthily Treated, nor could be admitted to such places as they desired, the Actions of their Predecessors being objected against them. But Queen Elizabeth sent Letters to the Hollanders, and one Thomas Budleigh, objecting to them, with much Regret, the Aid they sent to France, saying, They could not want her help, who could so freely gratifie others. Whereto the States made this Answer, That they did it not out of any ambitious counsel but meer necessity; that the Enemy
being drawn into many places at once, they might weary him out of breath, and themselves get a breathing space, for they were as it were forced, in regard the Queen sent Pay onely for six hundred Foot, and two hundred Horse which were in the Camp, where as six thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse of the League required the . She, on the other side, replyed, That although this was con∣tinued within the League, that at the end of the War, whatever was disbursed, should be repaid; yet she desired very earnestly, payment of what she had laid out, at leastwise that they would pay for some part thereof at the present, and she would take the rest by Annual Portions. Adding withall Threats, That if she were not obeyed herein, that she should take such course as her Lenity  not use to be acquainted with. To these, the States, after the return of many Thanks, De∣sired the Queen to cast an Eye upon the present times; to ob∣serve, that the War was very burthensom to them, and not wholly so successful as was hoped: And that of late the enlargment of their Bounds, had little increased their Tributes, but much aug∣mented their trouble and charge in the defence; That their Mer∣chandizing and Fishing Trade, upon which two onely they lived, that was spoiled by the detention of their Ships in Spain; and this oftentimes the Injuries of the English, and the Dunkirkers Pyra∣ous much impaired and the Sea also had done them very great da∣mages by Innundations: Over all which, if they should now be for∣ced to repay to England the Money due, and also the Queen should openly fly from the Covenants of the League the French al∣ready beginning to stagger It was with great reason to be feared, that the insinuating Designs of the Enemy, and the Allurements of a dangerous Peace, would prevail with the people: But it was not to be avoided however but that the States must pay with their own Money the English Souldiers, that lay not in the Towns put to Pledg to the Queen. While these things were arguing between them, some new Endeavours of the Enemy brought the Queen to be more
mild towards these her Allies: For the Spaniards, out of French Bretaign, had fallen into Cornwal, wasting the Coun∣try, and carrying away great Booty, together with some ho∣nourable persons; and also they began in the open Face of the World to assist the Rebellion in Ireland; which Coun∣try, was, from all Antiquity, possessed by many Petty Princes Natives thereof: Of whom, Dermack, the Son of Munhard the most Potent, was despoiled of his Dominion, for many Acts of Tyranny by him committed: Whereupon he got to him, for his Son-in-law and Assistant, Richard Earl of Pem∣brook, who making War there in Ireland very successfully, was recalled by an Edict of Henry the Second King of Eng∣land, and compell'd to transfer all his Right and hope of Principality to the King; who himself, in defence of hir new Acquisition, went into Ireland with a great Army, and made some of the Lords by Force; others, by Treaties and Promises, to acknowledge his Authority as Supream. But such was the blindness and simplicity of that Age, that it was be∣lieved a great support of future Right and Jurisdiction, if the Pope's Authority and Consent were obtained; and he who never bestowed gratis upon any man so much as words, gave to the Kings of England the Dominion of Ireland; but so, as he should be a Feodary of the Church, and pay to the same a certain Tribute: But the following Kings refused to make any such Payment; pretending, That the Peers of the King∣dom of England had never consented to it. At last, King Henry the Eighth, despising the Name of Lord, (for till then the Kings of England were onely call'd Lords of Ireland) first took to himself the most Noble Title of King, by his own power assuming that Honour, which his Daughter Queen Mary afterwards chose rather to receive from the Pope. But although Ireland, where it is most civiliz'd, hath by little and little learn'd to receive and indure both the Eng∣lish Laws and Governours; yet it remain'd in other parts,
which are fuller of Woods and Bogs, a Lover of its pristine and Natural Liberty: For, by that Name, the Licentious∣ness almost of all, which in other places is forbidden, was cal∣led. Among the rest, the Family of Oneal is very eminent; of which, one first challeng'd the Principality of Ulster, and soon after of all Ireland. These Irish, under such a Head, gather'd Courage, especi∣ally because England was at that time miserably torn, by the Bloudy Dissentions of the two Royal Families of York and Lancaster. But Henry the Eighth ruling peaceably, yet with a severe Hand, compelled the Heir of that Stock, intitled Con Oneal, to abjure the Name and Title of Oneal, which was presently swallow'd up in the Honour and Dignity of the Earl of Tyrone. Some believed, that Matthew was Son to this Man; but others suppose the same Matthew to be the Son of a Black-Smith: But his Grand-Father Con exceed∣ingly loved his Wife, and therefore suffer'd to be obtruded upon him, either a strange, or an uncertain Issue. This Man was slain by John, who affirm'd himself the lawful Sonne of Con; yet, before his Murther, had a Son, call'd Hugh, who was partly bred at Home, partly in England, and, by the Fa∣vour of Queen Elizabeth, had both the Earldom of Tyrone, and whatever belonged to Con, (the afore-named John be∣ing kill'd in his Rebellion, and all his Goods and Estate con∣fiscated) but under such Conditions, as for the future, took from him all possibility of doing a prejudice. He was a Man very knowing in matters of War; and, being intrusted in many Affairs, faithfully performed his Duty to the Queen; until in the year, 1588. when that most notable Spanish Fleet being beaten and scatter'd, some of the Commanders therein, with some Vessels, were cast away upon the Coast of Ire∣land; at which time, holding private Conferences with him, they stirred him up to recover the Right and Title of Oneal: Yet however he might then fix his Resolution, he discover'd
no sign thereof at the present: But others being risen in Arms, mov'd thereto, either out of Zeal to the Roman Religi∣on, or by the Injuries received from the English, he a long time covering his Hostile Mind with the Veil of Obedience, denied the guilt of any Crimes, with no less Confidence, than they were objected against him: However, without doubt, it was a great failing in the English, who would not, when they might, put into safe custody, a man of so fierce a Nature, whom they supposed guilty: But he, first casting into Prison the Children of John, that he might not be impeded by any Domestick Quarrel; and this year having heard, that General John Norris, a man famous in the Belgike War, and then employ'd in French Bretaigne, was called thence with the old Souldiers, to appease the Irish Commotions, put him∣self in the Head of the Rebels; but yet not omitting, with most humble words, to desire peace and pardon, throwing the cause of the Quarrel upon the cruelty of the Lord Lieu∣tenant of Ireland: By this kind of Policy, and by Truces, he endeavour'd to protract the War, until the Assistance promi∣sed from Spain might arrive: And there his Devices and Intents were much forwarded, by the Discords between Russel Deputy of Ireland, and Norris, who was appointed General of the War; Their Enmity growing to that height, that whatever seem'd fit to the one, the other would not con∣sent to; because the first liked, and for no other Reason. But the Queen, after the breaking forth of this Rebellion, began a more fierce War; Not for her Allies, as before was pre∣tended, but for her own sake: And therefore she sent out out Drake a person well known in the Western World, with a great Fleet prepared, partly at her own Charges, and partly at the cost of private Men, with hope to seize and take the Wealth gather'd together and laid up in Porto Ricco. But the News of their coming being gotten thither before them, all the Wealth being carryed thence more into the Land, the Port it self was inclosed and stopp'd up by the Spaniards:
Wherefore Drake wasting all the other places of the Cana∣ries, going from thence to the American Streights, he spoiled the Town of Nombre de Dios, that lyes between two Seas; where himself, together with many of his men, either by the untemperateness of the Air, or with grief of mind, that the Success of his Voyage answer'd not his Desires, dyed. About which time also another English-man, Sir Walter Rawleigh, Captain of the Queen's Guard, entring the River Orenoco, came to Guiana, a place never conquer'd by the Spaniards, of which he made a discovery, from his own sight and know∣ledge. But as to the Amazons, and those whose Faces are in their Breast, having onely been heard of, but never seen, he left the finding of them out to others. I should deprive Posterity, both Foreign and Domestick, of the profitable, and no less delightful part of the History, if I should not set forth at large the Voyages at Sea; whereby it is brought to pass, That the Hollander's Felicity, even in the midst of their Troubles, hath not onely exceeded the happi∣ness of others in peace, but also of themselves: For these being as it were born Sea-men, have from thence raised the chief, if not the sole support of their War; not studying to divide the World, or caring to be subject to the Bishop of Rome's Rules, who hath ascribed to the Spaniard the greatest part of his Nature; whereby, under the Cloak of Religion, he might oppress the Liberty of the whole World. The antient Bounds of Merchandize and Trade, for which these Nations, through many Ages, were famous, besides a few Islands, were two Narrow Straights, and the Seas with∣in them; This Way towards the Sound; That Way towards Hercules Pillars, and the Islands of Gades. There is between these a middle Coast of the Ocean, where all the Profit ari∣sing to the Traders upon one side, grows by their Selling or Battering the same on the other side; for they (the Dutch) have a want of Corn, nor indeed have plenty of any other
considerable Commodity. Their Gain ariseth, by carrying it from place to place; and by such Things as are wrought by the Hands of Artificers, commonly call'd, Manufactures: But after, by the good Providence of God, the Efficacy of the Load-Stone was found out, whereby men were guided to un∣derstand the Course of the Sea; and also, the Records of Books taught us, to make search after the knowledg of the Antients, and not to despair the value of new Inventions; nothing now remained too hard for the Scrutiny of Human Experience. The Portugeze found the utmost Borders of Africa and Asia, and the Castilian new Coasts beyond▪ the Ocean, or, indeed, more truly another World: The Endeavours of the French quickly grew faint, after an unhappy Attempt upon Brasile, they came to Terra-Nova, and found a Coast abound∣ing with Fish, but barren enough of all things else: Not was that Sea, and those Lands, that lying furthest off to the South Mallegon first of all found, now left unsearched: But the English, in a short space following, in part discover'd the North Sea. After all the Hollanders, that had without doubt been hitherto oppressed by the Cruelty of their Princes, as men that would not tremblingly send to Sea their People, whom they knew valiant and mindful of their Liberty, now out of Envy to their Enemies, and Emulation to their Allies, took the Courage and Boldness, that making use of what was already known, they would now, in their Turn, contribute their Labours for the benefit of Mankind, in the natural lay∣ing open of things, which, to that Age, had remained as a secret in the Breast of Nature. Neither in this further Quest of newer Things, were the old omitted or forgotten; And in∣deed, what Shore is able to satisfie them, who have always at Sea above Seventy Thousand men? This little Country, in mul∣titude of Shipping, not giving place to any the greatest King∣dom, and though inclosed in such narrow Limits, hath yet so
great a strength abroad. The Cities every year, build two thousand new Ships: theefore besides England, France, the Parts of Germany, and the Baltick Sea, mutual poverty hath admitted and carryed them to Spayn, importing thither Mer∣chandise, and bringing thence Coyn, and the dissimulation and fear of King Philip, was least if he should dea them of Trade with their Neighbours, they should seek for is fur∣ther off, and it may be, to his disadvantage; nevertheless, sometimes they received injuries, when onely for their Re∣ligions sake, they should be taken notice of; (for they ge∣nerally used the names of other Nations) and at last, as if the King needed their help, both the Ships and Marriners should be stayed; by which means, not onely themselves were endangered, but all they had was a prey to those that overpowred them. In this very year, no less than fifty Ships were thus raised; And the Portugueses said, that the King would take care to moderate these injuries, if the Hollanders would forbear to send Navall Assistance, as well to Brytain as France. But the Spanish losses were repaired out of Italy, for their so many barren Summers last past, for France was not able, by reason the Country had been so harassed with War. Thus by the Swedish Voyage, the Dutch had gotten into their hands all Grain, which by a short recourse hither and thi∣ther, they had made hast to get to their no small advantage; Nor as it happened, did that Commodity wait upon the Rich onely for vent, being dispersed far and wide among the common People, with a small charge, and a quick return. They went also to Barbary, where it is opposite to the O∣cean, and where it coasts upon any more inward Sea; with the Muscovite also the Hollanders Traded, before they were at War, and through the Baltick Sea, and Norva in Livonia, as far as Novograde: which Trade afterwards, was trans∣ferred by the English, through the Rushian Gulph to St. Ni∣cholas
Port, and by the Hollanders to Podesemser, and the Monastery of St. Michael he Archangel, all scituate upon the River Duina, and the English have earnestly laboured since that, to get it all to themselves the Prayers and liberty of the Hollanders scarcely prevailing: Shortly after, they fetched a longer course to the Kingdom of Guiny, abounding in Gold, Ivory, and Ebony, and the rest of Ethiopia; and at last, in a two years Voyage, they arrived to the Isles in the Indian Sea. That was begun to be attempted with four Ships, set out at the costs of private men. At first it was doubtful, and seemed to be full of danger, while every where, as they came in those unknown places, they met with none but barbarous Nations, and such as were at enmity with all the World; Here they were mightily afflicted with Diseases, and the injurious heat of the patching Ayr; Besides, the Portugueses hindred them all they could by punishments, if they were either by stress of Weather, or want of any thing driven to their Vessels or Colonies, nor ceased they so, but pursued them with false ac∣cusations unto those Kings and People, that were not sub∣jected to them: which a long time was very bitter, while all things were incumbred by the infrequent use of a strange Tongue, and suspitions of treachery on every hand: But af∣ter it appeared by publike Letters and Testimonials of Trade, that they came not to rob and do violence, or to seek domi∣nion, but that they were a People careful of the liberty, even of strangers, and that they had for that end passed so many Seas, that they might with equal fidelity, uphold the Law of Nations, on a sudden, the same and admiration of the Hol∣landers was greatly augmented: Thus the Spaniard's malice opened a way for such far distant Allyances by the common gain of Renowned Merchandise, and the name of Pr Maurice, the famous Warrier, was honoured even in those remote places. The Religion of those that first went to the Indies, was wonderful, so was the care of their Reputation; for because
they received no Commission, other then to defend them∣selves, when they met the Spanish Navy, a rich Prey, and as it were prepared for them they let it passe untouched; Scarcely could the Portugueses cruelty, which would admit none into that World, besides themselves, be drawn to con∣sent otherwise, But hat these private Ships would strengthen their Trade by War; however, Embassies of the Indians fol∣lowed, and Gifts and Sea-fights against the Enemy, and which helped most of all, it appeared, that the Spaniard could be overcome: for to the taken of Towns, thee was no great space of ground belonging, so that the Conquerours gained but little, and yet the Conquered lost not much. The parts of that Kingdom are far divided, their Wealth, which is the support both of their bounty and Wr, lies at a great distance; which being taken away, o exhausted by troubles, how can it happen otherwise to that vast scattered, and separated Empire, which is no where so near to it self, as to its Enemies: but that it should become a prey to all Nations? The Coast also of America, where yet it is pub∣lickly free, and where it is privately subject, hath become known by the fear of the King of Spain. From thence is brought Salt, Pearl, and Skins of Buff▪ I passe by other Lands and people, discovered and honoured with the care of the finders. That Voyage seems to me the most memorable, wherein the Hollanders went so far to the Northward, that it might be known whereof the whole World before was ig∣norant, what Ocean did joyn Europe and Asia: so both the Nobles and Merchants had conceived a hope, that the most opulent Kingdom of Cathay and China, and farther off, the Moluccas and India, might be gone to a far nearer way, than that used by the Spaniards. Three Ships, one of Holland, one of Zeland, and one Westfrizeland, went out to this in∣tent, which having passed by Norway and Finland, at uilo∣dun, an Isle of Lapland, they separated, and every one took a several course; The Hollanders coming first through the fur∣thermost
Sea, to the side of Nova Zembla, over against them, where the Stream runs a great way to the North-west, some two Islands, which as a token or limit of their Voyage, they named, Orange-Islands, being about the degree seventy six. The rest passing the Sea which leads to Rushia, and choosing the Coast of Condore and Pitzore, came to the Straights, where they saw Land, fronting, o lying opposite to the Continent, which narrowing the Sea, giveth it the name of Waygats. They doubted, whether it were a narrow Sea, or onely a Bay or Creek. Here the day was darkned with Clouds, and the Ice con∣tinued for a long space, which the cold North wind, with equall danger, both tumbles together, and casteth asunder. A long time they were in suspence, whether they should make any further search towards the end of the World; At last, with much strugling, breaking forth those unknown, and un∣couth bounds, where they begun to withdraw themselves from the Land, with a direct course to the South-East, from thence they sailed towards Scithia, by the outmost part of Zembla, in the one hundred and tenth degree of the Equator, untill they conjectured, they were past that Sea, wherein the River Obis, coming out of the Sarmatian Marishes, is swallowed up in the Sea. This is the antient River Carambuci, as the Learned be∣lieve, than which there needeth no better a boundary be∣tween Europe and Asia. Which tryalls performed, and meet∣ing the other Ship, which the exceeding great Ice had driven back from Zembla, the third Month after they went out, they returned home again. This was done the Summer before this year: And so much satisfaction was received from this first Assay, that it was concluded, more Ships should be sent to make further expe∣riment not towards Zembla, but by the Nassavian Sea, which way carryed with it more of hope: So had they said at first, of that which runs between Waygats and the Sarmatians. But
here delay, a frequent impediment to the greatest Affairs, steps in, so that the Ships going out later in the year, than they ought to have done, found the Sea impassable: so cruel and vehement a cold, and, which in that Clymate was rare, had turned all into Ice. They who came back from both the Voyages, declared the nature both of the Sea and Soyl, the unheard of forms of Birds and Beasts, as they found and saw the same. They ob∣served also the prominent Capes, Bayes, Culphs, and Ri∣vers, with the Scituation of the places, together with the names of the Country, Prince, yea and of the very people: they told also of many little Islands, and what was spoken of by the Ancients, that they were so variable, by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, that now they would appear to be really Islands, and anon, they would seem parts of the Continent. The bigger of these beyond the Strait, worthy to be re∣membred for its safe Harbour in time of danger, they called by the name of the States, and because it produceth upon the tops of the Frozen Mountains Crystall, not much unlike to Diamonds. It seems to me very congruous, to describe the Scituation of this Country, and what Men or Beast are to be found there, it being then first throughly known, and whe∣ther Authours of greatest Antiquity, have related concerning this matter, the same things, or other more vain and frivolous. Also we rashly believe, that by Magick Art there are caused at the North Pole, four Euripi, or Arms of the Sea; and how to go to the Caspian Gulf to the North, of old was questioned by wise men, while others affirm from the Verses of the Poets, That the whole World was shut up in the Sea: Another sort in that part, define an unbounded Land, extended into the utmost extremity of cold, under the Frozen Zone. And they who have assumed to themselves the License of fabulous In∣ventions, upon unknown places, stick not to say, That the very Sea it self stands still, and is without any motion▪ and is as
it were a vast Body, and naturall Mass, deficient in it self, from the intent for which it was made, or else forsooth, that it is a se∣cret proper onely to the Gods or more sacred Theory: Some o the contrary, affirm it unaccessible, through the violence of Whirl-winds and Monsters: But if any could passe to the end of that Sea, they should either meet again with fertile Countries, or nothing but Air and Fire. They have given great hope of sailing through it, in whose Books it is signified, that the Indians hve often by the force of tempest, been taken from thence, and driven forth upon the Coast of Germany: Neither needed it to speak more of the temperature of the Ayr, and the nature of the place, since some have placed these Northern People in continual day-light, and report them most exemplary for Fidelity and Justice; Others that the whole Region is covered with thick darkness, and utterly alienated from the lively Aspect of one benevolent Star; being altogether desert, by reason of wild Beasts, and the barbarity of the Inhabitants, (if any) and co∣vered over with Snow, and some first say, it may be seen, and presently, that it is without the World. All which so great repugnances, seem for the most part, to have drawn their O∣riginall from truth, as far as the same may be proved, by the experiments of Navigators, and the Speeches of the Inhabi∣tants; for about that Sea, which extends it self all along upon the Coast of Lapland, Rushia, and that Country which we call Samogitta, the Summer day-light by two Months longer, doth promise the like darkness in Winter; But that very time of the Suns appearance, is so obscured with Clouds, little lightsomer than night it self, and the benefit of heat so far remote, that the Sun can indeed by exhalation, procure or cause a Cloud, but not dssipate or dissolve it. And then again, the whole place is for the most part so covered with Snow, that one cannot readily distinguish between the Sea and Land. The Sea indeed is not very dangerous by storms, be∣cause on both sides, it grow larger from the Strait, as it were
restrained by its own coldness: So that the Antients did not without Reason, call it sometimes the Dead, and other whiles the Frozen Sea. For wheresoever it approacheth the Land, its condensed Waves congealed into Ice, continue a long time, and at a great distance to be seen upon the shore, nay sometimes the continued congelations of many years, may be seen together in one great heap; but when the Wind breaks, o a remission of cold loosens these conjoyned con∣densations, the several fragments, like little Mountains or I∣slands, are violently carryed into the Sea, and sometimes meet and dash one against another, like two Rocks. And this terrour hath beyond measure afflicted Naviga∣tors, because when they make off from Land in search, the narrow Sea, whose breath is but two hours Sail, but the length contains five dayes passages, of a sudden, becomes all so concrete, that it may be walked upon: and when it is thawed, the Ice goes not away by degrees, but is forced as it were, to fall into two Seas. There are scarce fifty dayes of ours, at the greatest time of hear, before the latter Equinoctial; and that very time can∣not with them be accounted Summer, but rather an internal, or small relaxation of Winter: then indeed, you may posi∣tively discern the decay of the Ice, but longer than that, the Frost again approaching, will not suffer any Sailings; with∣in that time, the People did go to Rushia, where was seen the remains of some unfortunate Voyage, as floating lanks, and the like, whether the returning cold, or any other Reason, made them appear, is uncertain. These People also trade beyond the River Obis; and there their home-dangers have taught them to Winter, and at the ccustomed time to go back, when the Waters are open, and pssable for them: By the same means that the Hollanders had confidence to passe the Streights of Magellan, they took Courage through these Straights also to get into the Ocean; sometimes by the vio∣lent streams of Rivers running into the Sea, being carryed
out, and then as if they doubted what course to hold, or if the Wind did but abate, by the force of the same Rivers to be carryed back again; thus as it were, being divided between the Surges of the salt Sea, and the pleasures of the fresh Wa∣ter; and anon, in their passage from side to side, leaving the shore, they might see the rolling Waves, foaming and dan∣cing in the prosundity of the main Ocean; together, with several sorts of Monsters; for it is wonderful to be told, how full that Sea is bestial Animals. There are both Sea-Calves, and Sea-Dogs, and the best of all wild Creatures, which is called a Morse, of a wonderul and active fagacity to defend it self, yet scarcely penetrable by any blowes. It hath seet almost like a Beavor, hath a large Body, and use lie equally, both the Sea and Land; for some∣times it is seen to lie upon the Ice, and other times to lie at sunning upon the tops of the Banks, and Cliffs near the Sea. It climbs up but slowly, and with great pains, but descends with an incredible swiftness; The People of those parts, set as great a value upon their Teeth, as we do upon Ivory. The Rushians do say, that the divided Sea once past Way∣gats meets together again, and again breaks out, from which Speech I cannot affirm, whether they intend Tabi, or the Scythian Mountain, so well known of old, and Zemble stretching into the East, though a little short, do meet, or the narrow Sea, by which America divided from Tartary, doth make out by countenance manners and Customs, that those Nations have the same Original; From Pitzone, a Province of Muscovy, as far as the River Obis, whatever borders upon the Sea, is, I cannot say, inhabited, but perambulated by the Samogitians, a kind of Sarmatian People, Couagious and Fortunate, contrary to the barbarousness of their nature, and the inclination of the Clymate: 'tis true, their Countenan∣ces are ill favoured, and black with smoak, with little Eyes, and wide Nostls. Their Bodies, though but of an ordinary size, yet are very strong, so that they equal in swiftness the
most Creatures: They content themselves with little, and are always in action, neither weakened with pleasures and yot, nor worn out with cares: Whereever they go, all that they lay their hands on, is properly their own; nor have they any other kind of Possession, then a mind resolved to, and content with all hazards and adventures; Thus they enjoy all things, because they cover nothing; Their Arms are ac∣cording to the Soythian and Parthian manner, a Bow and Ar∣rows, which they chiefly use against wild Beasts: from these they have their Garments made of their Skins, wherewith they cover themselves all over, both Head and Hands; and their Food is the raw flesh of the same Beasts, as if they sa∣tisfied themselves with the gifts of nature, without any addi∣tion. They are so far from having any delicates, that both the use and name of Bread, is unknown among them. This kind of life they think better, than to plow up the Ocean, and weary out the over-toyled Earth, and still to promise them∣selves a further accomplishment of their desires, being hate∣ful both to our selves and others. They know there are Ships, but never troubled themselves with the study of making the like, but keeping themselves within their own Territories, unless as it were by Divine As∣sistance, when the several Elements are consolidated into one Body of Ice. Thus they go sorth and return, when in a long Hunting, they trace their prey, as far as Waygats, and Zembla; They affirmed those places to be two Islands, and that they were torn off from the Continent, but by a small Arm of the Sea: There they have born sway, longer than they know them∣selves, because beyond them, there is nothing but vast Wil∣dernesses, and wild Beasts: The Marriners in their second Voyage, saw him, that boasted himself to be the Prince of all those People, a Man who was remarkable, neither in Habit, nor Majesty, his Age being the onely thing in him, that deserved respect.
From Muscovy, whose Dominion hath been much increas∣ed within few Ages, the Rhiphean Mountains encompass them on the back and sides, as is believed, which being unaccessi∣ble, by reason of the Snow, they call the Girdle of their Land, and their poverty is their defence: notwithstanding which, their Neighbours pay them Tribute, the Skins of wild Beasts; for indeed they have nothing else, and this they do, rather out of hatred to, than fear of War: The appearances of the Coasts of Samogitia, Sembla and Waygats  are almost the same, in some places dangerous, because of Rocks, and in other places so even, that it is fordable. The Ground there is offey, and full of Marishes, but no where Woody: no Herbs or Grass fit for any good use grows there, whereof in most places, nature is prodigall, onely here no such thing is ever seen. And this makes it the greater wonder, to see the boughs and Bodies of Trees, swimming here and there in this place, unless it be, that the vast Ocean stirred with the very turnings of the shores, breaks into those remoter Lands towards the North, and so overturns all before it. 'Tis probable, that by such like force, the Islands which we now see, have been broken off from the Continent of Sarmatian, perchance of old, jetting out so hither and thi∣ther, as their sight makes appear. What part soever of that Coast, our Ships touched upon, they perceived sometimes smoak, and the foot-steps of men, but no Cities, nor so much as a Village; The inner part of the Country, is believed to have Woods and Lakes, which are filled and nourished by the perpetual dissolutions of Snow: All hereabouts, ac∣cording as the Soyl and water pleased, diverse that lurked scatteringly here and there in poor Hovels, or in Caves, ap∣peared, which places, served them only for fire to refresh their Bodies, against the bitterness of the Weather: wherein, though they could hardly stir, yet would they not be idle; The chief, nay & only Housholdstuff they have, is a kind of Sledge, which is drawn with incredible celerity, by four-footed
Creatures, not much unlike a Hart, sliding as it were in these, they trace their prey through the deepest Snows, yea, and change their Seats. All this Region is divided, though somewhat unequally between wild Beasts, and these Savage men. There is abundance of Hares and Wolves, both with white Skins; Martins also, Sables, and many other Beasts, whose Skins are of great value: Here are Beares of a more than or∣dinary bigness (which are made white too, by the sharpness of the cold) and are beyond expression, fierce and ravenous, because they want Pasture, insomuch, as if they but once get a scent of prey, neither the fear of Weapons, nor the Sea it self, can put a stop to their eagerness, or lessen their pursuit. This mischief, miserably lost some of the unwary Seamen, that went a-shore, nor were their Companions able to help them otherwise, than by seeing them eaten, and afterwards to seek a too late Revenge. Upon the rising part of this Coast, was observed a sad division between Religion and profaneness; when upon the tops of the Hills on one side, innumerable Effigies of the Gods, testified both an igno∣rance of Art and dulness of understanding; and on the other Erected Crosses, shewed marks of Christianity: For the Rushi∣ans, whom either Tempest, or the desire of Trading for Furs, had brought into that part of the Continent, and among those Islands, had been taught Christianity by the Greek Church, fix Ages before; The Samogitians worship the Hea∣vens and the Stars, (Deities not worse than others.) accor∣ding to their old Custom, nor do they believe it lawful, to hate those that dissent from them. There are some, that in those Woods, stick not to worship by an unknown kind of Superstition, things horrible, both to sight, and hideous for their dreadful noyse; nay, and call Snakes and Serpents sacred. But the Samogitian Customs are not so barbarous, not much differing from those used in Lap∣land, and Finland; although some, from their name, would
argue, that in former Ages they did eat mans flesh; which if we allow, there are these to be numbred among those people, whose lives were so mollified by age and example, shewed an apt inclination of mankind, to leave off their old and customary barbarity: At the first coming thither of the Hollanders, they were fearful meerly our of ignorance, they provided for their security, either by Arms or flight: But after they had tryed out innocence, and received some triviall Presents; (two sacred tyes) they called to witness the Sun, and their own poverty, that they were even against their wills, overcome by good turns; And if at any time after∣wards, Fortune smiled upon us, we were altogether behold∣ing to the affections of those People which border upon the Sea; though it were very necessary, that Castles should be built in those passages, to preserve the use of that new found Sea, and where Ships may have shelter and Harbour, if any sudden accident should happen. Then if industrious care, to∣gether with men meet there, the Island of Waygats is no less fit for Tillage, than those places which are inhabited in the utmost skirts of the Danish Kingdom; for as under the very line, where the Country is beyond measure hot, so those pla∣ces which being far off at both the Poles, or frozen up, will both admit humane Inhabitants, which by Custom, or being born there, after the first Plantation, will be naturalized to the Clymate, contrary to the Opinion of the Antients, as experience convinceth us; for certainly, Nature condemned no part of her self to Solitude, so that Groenland being more to the Northward, yet may, and without question would, pro∣duce and bear Fruit and Corn, according to our manner in Europe. 'Tis true, and equally probable to be believed, that at first many places lay desert and unmanured, while yet the choycer parts of the Earth would suffice for all; But when by little and little, either multitude or discord, forced men to seek further Habitations, the Land demonstrated the Sea, and that again discovered more Land.
Obdor is the next Region to Obis, famous for the Effigies and Oracle of a Noble old Woman: Beyond the little Ri∣ver Molgomzay, there is another greater, and a Bank of the same Name, whereof the Russians used by Authority not for Trade: But all the rest surely is fabulous; as, That the peo∣ple of Leucomoria, die in the Winter, and revive again in the Spring, while, in the interim, the onely Religion of the In∣habitants, is performed in the exchanging Commodities ex∣posed to Barter: That the mens Bodies are all rough and hairy, and their Heads and Faces resembling a Dogs, is no less vain surely, than those forged Inventions of the Antients, who have bestow'd upon some people Horses Feet; upon o∣thers, Ears of such bigness, that they cover their whole body; so that every where almost, the Report of these Things is made more wonderful, by additional hear-say: yet that some of these, and which is confirm'd with more certain Testimony of Truth, as Men without Heads, who have their Faces in their Breasts, either really be such, or seem so to be, by the shortness of their Necks and their Shoulders sticking up. I will not obstinately deny, well knowing, as in some places, the violence of Heat; so in other, the extremity of Cold, hath often warped Nature, and made it become deformed: From hence it is agreed. That the next are the Loppians, and the Mountain Imaus, and the Tartarian Hordes, removed to and fro among the Deserts, by a part of whom is Cathay possessed: Thence is the way to China, and other places in the Eastern part of the World. This same Year was made unlucky by Pyrates of Dun∣kirk, who took five and Thirty Ships of Holland sent to Norway for Timber, among all which, was but one Ship of War; but in regard they could not carry them off, they took the Masters of them as Pledges, till the Money promised for their Redemption was paid.
And shortly after, they took no less a prey from others going to France; But one of the Pyrates Vessels being cir∣cumvented by the Hollanders, the greatest part of their men being killed in fight, with the execution of forty three that survived, they alittle repressed that villinous, and growing presumption and besides, above twenty Ships more were freed, which were taken and detained by that Ship, every of which had promised, for the preservation of their lives, two thousand Florens and more. The Fifth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1596.THE Netherlanders, under the Spanish Obedience, be∣gan the year merrily, from the unaccustom'd Joy of them, which were come from the French Borders, as well as from the new hope conceiv'd from Albertus, Arch-Duke of Austria, who was sent with great honour to be Successor to Ernestus: He was the youngest of all his Brothers; But, which is a great advantage to Nobility, and an implicite Agree∣ment between the Pope and Kings, he was graced with a Cardinals Hat. Afterwards, being approved by Philip, for his Government of Portugal, where he had gotten Repute by his careful Obedience and Affability towards the Subjects; and therefore now was not thouht unworthy to be bound to the King in a nearer Tye, according to the Custom of Peo∣ple agreeing in Affection. To this purpose, that he might with the greater Honour undetake and enter upon this Govern∣ment, belonging to the House of Austria, great store of Pro∣visions
were made, both for Peace and War: He had a safe Journey from Spain into Italy, and thence, through Savoy and Burgundy as far as Lutzenburg, and the Borders of the Ne∣therlands: Souldiers both of Horse and Foot were on all hands drawn together; not onely as a Defence for the whole, but as a Supplement to the old exhausted Militia; which he, as soon as he came to the Army, he reduced into a few Regiments or Brigades, & partly filld them with old Soul∣diers, wisely desiring to find true Valour among them, rather than great Name and an outward shew, lest he should by an unnecessary multitude of Officers, both trouble the Soul∣diers, and burden the Treasury: And therefore he removed from being Governours and Colonels, all those Netherlandish Noblemen, who seldom coming at their charges, scarcely made use of any thing, besides the name and profit arising therefrom, putting others in their places, who by long obedi∣ence, had deserved to command; He appointed also, other things worthy of imitation, as, That none should carry an Ensign, unless he had thrice received pay; Moneys also were looked after, because a new Sedition was feared, and the old Sores began again to rankle; for prevention whereof, for the future, the Spaniard promised every Moneth, eleven hundred thousand Florens, but the same should not proceed beyond the first Autumn. The Archduke Albert, brought along with him a great Mass of uncoyned Silver, by which means, the damage of money to be returned by Writings, or Bill of Exchange, would be much advanced, and because being coyned in the Netherlands, it would bear the greater price; Besides, other∣wise, the many hazards of long Journies were now prevent∣ed the same at present being defended with a strong Guard▪ he brought with him also, and boasted it as a geat Pledge of his clemency, the Prince of Aurange, whose name was Philip William, who at the first beginning of the troubles in the Ne∣therlands, had been carryed thence, where being honourably
kept in the Spanish Court, had now first received his Liberty, for being firmly grounded in the Catholike Religion, and ob∣liged by that benefit, if he should go to his younger Brother and the Provinces where his Fathers Memory was yet f it was hoped he would either become a Moderator for Peace or be the cause of Discord among the Enemies: Nor truly was Albertus himself look'd upon by the Hollanders with a Evil Eye, being known to most of the Sea-men for his libe Clemency, when being all seized in Portugal, he dismissed them, to this very end, as was believed, in hope that the would spread abroad his Fame. But above all, he was most beloved before all others; because, by his coming, Ibarra and Fontayne, were removed from their maligned Greatness, and sent into Spain. But the absence of those was supplyed with many more; as, Francisco Mendoza, Admiral of the Arrage∣nian Sea, a chief man both in Counsel and Actions of Warre, Gonsalvo Carilia, Girolam Zapata, and Baptista Taxis, per∣sons with other Names, but of the same Nature and Disposi∣tion with the former, whereby dissembled Goodness was more feared, than the remaining Evils. The States of the United Provinces, fearing lest the Vulgar should be chang'd by the speech and presence of the Prince of Aurange writ to him, congratulating his Freedom from a Captivity of Twenty Eight years continuance: But that it was not safe for him to come within their Jurisdiction being all in Arms, unless he were publikely invited, nor could they, as present Affairs then stood, come to him: However, they hoped, that he, who had so throughly tryed the Spanish Cru∣elty, would not seek to subvert their Liberty, founded by his Fathers Counsels, and cemented with his Bloud. Whereto he answer'd, as concerning his Father dissemblingly, but to the rest friendly; to wit, That he was come thither, to be an Author of nothing, but what might conduce to the benefit of both Parties, whereupon he hoped he should meritedly expect their best Wishes.
Being then debarred thereof, for the time to come, he af∣ed nothing, complaining, That the Hollanders suspected , and the Spaniards hated him for his Alliance; wherefore he  not take up Arms, chiefly as being desirous of a private life,  partly also out of respect to his Brothers Honour. But Prince Maurice, and his Sister, who was marryed to Count Hohenlo, before he came into the Dutchy of Cleves, sent to him by particular Messengers, both Gifts and Money, each offering to clear themselves, concerning the Domestick Administra∣tions of those great Possessions in their Power. But the States, publickly desiring to avoid all imminent Snares laid to catch them, give Order for strict Watches upon the Ways; their chief Care was against the Jesuits, lest any Seditious Doct∣rine should be blown among the people. But Albertus, not elying upon these Inventions, although desirous of peace, yet so he might be ready for War; to which purpose, he made ready an Army of 15 Thousand, besides his Garri∣on. Fayer, a Town in Vermandois, surrounded both with War and Want, there was no reason or possibility to maintain, un∣less by continual Additions of little Forces, which must be put in by stealth, because all about it lay the Enemies Towns, with a great Body of Horse, beside the dampness of the fields: By how much the Besiegers Fortifications were greater, by so much more they terrified all that endeavour'd to approach it with the greater danger: Wherfore, to withdraw the Besiegers,  if they should stay, it was nearer to attaque Calais, a Town of greater value, and the ill repaired Fortifications of that City, perswaded the Avarice of the Praefects hereto. The Duke of Parma formerly destin'd the same thing; so did Fontayne afterwards, by the advice and perswasions of La∣. But the honour of beginning thereof was reserved for a new Governour. This most eminent Reward and remain of their Transmarine Expeditions, the English kept for two hundred years, as the main Port of their Sea; which being
regained by the Valour of Francis Duke of Guise, one Gor∣don had the Government thereof, which he soon after trans∣mitted to a near Kinsman of his own: But neither of them had to much care, as to amend what was decay'd and become ruinous, either by Age or War. And the Works were far short of an Age in standing, a Stone Wall encompassing the City: It hath a little Castle, slightly running out with four Platforms; there was not a Souldier in it that thought of an Enemy, but made it their business to strengthen their Autho∣rity, while they onely study to inrich themselves by Sea and Land, and (which is frequent, where there is a distraction in Affairs) out of a Captainship erect a Kingdom. Wherefore, neither the King of France, though he was fore-warned of the danger by some intercepted Letters, could help it, he ruling yet as it were but at pleasure, and by his Subjects good-will. Moreover, the Governour, hearing it strongly reported, that Calais was aim'd at, conscious to himself of the defects of the Town, admitted two Companies of Holland Souldiers into the Town, but no more, he himself having six more; where∣of when Albertus was told, the more to spread abroad the Terrour of his Design, he commanded several Bands to go out of the Town of Valenciennes under their Captains, and in the nearest parts of France to make a great Uprore. The Camp-Master-General Christian Roneè, the famousest Man among all the French Exiles, sent with part of the Army to begirt the Town, cut off all the Passages, by which onely Relief might come: For taking the Bridge, whereby the Land-Entrance is straitned, he raised against the Wall a Tower, which is called a Rice-Bank, just at the sides of the Port (this same way the Duke of Guise before found into the Town) where the Fortifications were long since half fallen down; which, the danger being not yet fully known, every one helped to fasten again, being shaken with Cannon plac'd upon the Shore, and not defended so long as it ought to have been, the Conquerour ascended and won.
After this the Hollanders Ships, which lay upon the Coast of Flanders, were driven off, that they might not so commo∣diously assist the Besieged: Notwithstanding which, among all the Shot, the Haven being very large, a Ship was convey'd into the Town, which deliver'd to the Governour such Work∣men as he requested, for the mending his Works together with a quantity of Gun-powder, and then returned. Shortly after the Count St. Paul, who had brought 1500 French-men to the Sea-Shore, for Relief of the Town, was promised by a Sea-man to be put into it, but he durst not undergo the dan∣ger. At last all the Arch-Duke's Forces being met together, and fought with upon the Sand-Hills; from whence the Besieged being forced, forthwith the Suburbs were gain'd. Within a while after, the Town it self, after a three days Siege, when the Gate began to be batter'd, between the People's Fear, and the Hatred of their old Lord (because the Governour him∣self was wanting both in Authority and Counsel) was sur∣rendred to the Spaniard. The Souldiery retired into the Ca∣stle, which was held six days, during a Truce, in hope of Re∣lief: And now Prince Maurice, with 50 Sail of Ships, and a great number of Souldiers, was come thither, to see what was the Resolution, as well of the English, as the French: But the Count St. Paul marched away, and the Earl of Essex was rea∣dy with a Fleet to fight the Spaniards, if, by chance, they should offer an Invasion: But the Emulation of the People never well agreeing, hindred it. For the Earl of Essex tryed Mounsieur de Vique, the Governour of the next French Garri∣sons, if he would suffer the English to have the Custody of Ca∣lais. if it were recover'd: But the French believed, that the English, now under a shew of Friendship, did clandestinely seek to regain, what they had long since gain'd by War. How∣ever, King Henry not minding to leave his Siege, but leaving his Army at Payer, and doing so, either because he despair'd of passage to Calais, the Way being cut off by Dutches that
let to the Sea, he came with 4000 men by the River Sama to Boloyn the next Harbour. And there he advised, but too late, about relieving the Castle of Calais. Prince Maurice being desired by the King to come on Land, he excused It, affirming, He was to advise concerning their own Borders  Home, which were left unprovided. But while they were argu∣ing, almost 300 Souldiers, under the Conduct of Campsa making use of the Night, and the Ebbe of the Sea, with great silence marching by Land, broke through the Trenches into the Castle, giving rather an Example of Courage, than any other help to the Besieged; for many of them, the Forts ly∣ing open to the Assailants, were killed, together with the Dutch Souldiers, at their very entrance, while the rest of the French, being altogether unaccustom'd and unfit so; War, by an inconsiderate Sally, caused the Ruine both of themselves and thers; at which time the Governour himself was slain: About 60 Hollanders valiantly defending themselves from the Topt of Houses, obtained a Grant to be sent away safe. The presence of the Arch-Duke caused the Victory to be moderately used, who having gained Calais, without the loss of many of  men and being a Town in the uttermost Borders of France augmenting and strengthning with good Works, he subjected it to the Government of Flanders, the Speech of which Pro∣vince was agreeable to the same. By the Fame of this Victory Arde, a Town lying not far off within the Land, (and for∣merly a stop to the English invading that Country) soon yielded it self to the power of Albertus; by which mean there was a passage this way open'd into France, with the same Felicity to him, as it was much to the blame of the Ene∣mies, that they had oppressed them e're they were aware: Two Thousand Souldiers marched out of this Town, which was indifferently well Fortified, having honourable. Terms, though dishonourably obtained; for they did not hold out so long, as to endure one Assault, being frighted with the dennu∣tiation of Death, if they forthwith did not surrender.
While these Things were doing, at last Fayer, being sub∣dued by Famine, King Henry distributed his Army into all places about, and near to, Calais, lest any of the weaker Cities' who were surprized with great fear, should make a defecti∣on to the Conquerour: whom the Flandrians intreated, (be∣ing now compelled to depart out of France, by want of all ne∣cessaries) promising to assist him with great Sums of Mo∣ney, if he would besiege Ostend, and restore it to them, that Town onely being wanting upon all that Coast: And Prince Maurice fearing the same, went himself to view it, and took care at his departure, that they at present be supplyed with Souldiers enow, and afterwards should be stored with Victu∣als, and all other Things, both for maintaining their Works, and for War; which the Scouts and Spyes relating; as also, that the Sea came up to the very Town, with a commodious Haven, and that all backward was very dangerous, being full of Elluaries: So that Siege was put off, left being rashly be∣gun, it should wound and lacerate the Fame of his first Suc∣cesses. Yet because, besides the Auxiliaries sent to France, a great part of the Holland Souldiers was swallow'd in the English Fleet, Peace was by them condemned, though it mainly was contested by the Requests of the Cities, and the Counsels of the Captains; whither they should carry the War. But while the Dukes Forces were employ'd in France, Prince Maurice his Horse wasted all the utmost Skirts of Brabant, and the Netherlanders with Fire and Sword, and took Ech∣tach, a Town in Lutzenburg; and as soon as those Retreat∣ed into Flanders, the French likewise fell in there. Thus had each of them continually a troublesom Enemy at his Back or Side; Fusa's and Albertus Troops attending each others mo∣tions, as Fortune or Opportunity presented occasions. And certainly, this time, by much Exercise, and the Care of the Commanders, gave to the Hollander's establish'd Horse, not onely an Example of being moe active and vigilant to the greatest Attempts, but also instructed them better, and reduced
them to a more setled Discipline. For the Spanish Brigades were even inclosed and unfit for Service, when, on the other side, all the Enemies Country lay open to the Nassania Horse, as a fit Object for their Spoil. The Arch-Duke, when he thought fit to march out, that he might not leave any thing dangerous, or suspectfull to him behind, removed from T∣mont all the Italians, first giving them their Pay; then be∣ing all his Hopes and Counsels against Hulst, because it seem∣ed the reducing thereof would quiet Flanders, and be of no small advantage also to Brabant. It is a Town of no strength, by reason of the Antiquity of its Building, whereof Prince Maurice being Conquerour, and having a long time design∣ed to change and alter the round fashion of the Walls, he had added, in the interim, some Fortifications to the new made Trench. Soon after the Zelanders, undertaking the de∣fence, and keeping thereof, erecting some Forts about the ad∣jacent Fields, did seem rather to have taken Counsel for pre∣serving the Country, than the Town: The chief strength of the place is a River arising not far off, which being helped forward by Art, that it might, so passing further, fall into the Hont, was also brought back into the Scheldt; for, that same River, by both Names, being full of Meanders, washeth all the back-part of the Territory of Hulst: By which means, it is on every side inaccessible, as is an Island; and being in∣pendent on both Battles, daily sent forth Souldiers to plunder and wast the Land of Wase, and the Province of Brabant: Be∣sides, they could cut their Sea-Banks, to let in the Water up∣on their Enemies; and then they that were within the River were lyable to Slaughter by the Darts and Shot of the Town. During the several Governments of Ernestus and Fontayn, the Flandrians had erected two Castles, to stop their Excur∣sions: The Ʋnited States had raised more for the Defence of the Bank. Two of these were annexed to the Town, by an excurrent Rampire or Breast-Work; which Passage, as we has the mutual assistance of each to the other, was hidden
by the Ground which lay open between them. These were not both of an equal strength, for that which was called Nassau Fort, was the stronger, being opposite to the Hont, because it served as a safeguard for the bringing Recruits, ei∣ther from Axele, or the Isles of Zeland. They that were sent by Albertus to view the place, being testified with these Difficulties, advised quite contrary to what was before resolved on: For how was it possible (say they) to carry over naked Souldiers, a great quantity of Pro∣visions, and a Train of Artillery, which can but move slowly, while those Threatning Forts stand there to resist, and espe∣cially a great Fleet of the Enemies lying in the Scheldt, into the very middle whereof, their lesser Vessels will penetrate. Certainly, it was both a difficult and doubtful Attempt, not did the rest seem to have any thing more of Expedition, for the Soll was full of Marishes, the Enemy active and vigilant, and the Siege would be to little purpose, in regard of their free passage with shipping: Nor had they any better hopes to gain the same by Assault, for that the Town would be con∣tinually supply'd with found and fresh men: Besides all this; the King of France, having taken many of his Rebels into Mercy, it was to be fear'd, he would venter into all vacant places with greater Force: Nor indeed could it be accounted an Honourable Action, to attaque Hulst through so many Ha∣zards. But Claudius Barlot, a Netherlander, and the most earnest of all the Colonels, rising up, desired he might have the car∣rying over those Regiments, against which the Spanish Offi∣cers had spoken: That the rest of their Arguments were fill'd with nothing but vain fear, whereas they ought, to expect some good success, to wait upon their courage, and hope for an opportunity, either from the errour or fear of the Enemy; That the vicissitudos of War should be brought to a stay, if equall Counsels should be found on both sides, and a like valour in every one: At present, the matter being dissembled
to most, but some few, that they might the better drw the Enemy into a Condition of Security, whom to remove one of the suspected places, was the chief work: the design ∣ed not its effect; For Rones, by making a Bridge over the Scheldt, was commanded to march with some Ensigne into Brabant, meerly to affright them of Berghen or Breda, where∣by he compelled Prince Maurice, leaving a Garrison at Hulst, whereof Count Solmes was Governour, to follow him diligently with the rest of his Bands. Then certainly, if ever at any time, were the Forces of the Ʋnited Provinces small because for the avoiding too great charges, they were contented only to maintain their own Borders; but this year made them sensible of the folly of such kind of Resolves, they having therein suffered so many losses, and undergone so vast expencs: Part of their Soul∣diers were by agreement aboard the English Fleet; the other part was gone into France, to relieve Cambray, and whit re∣mained, was almost taken up by their Garrisons; the German Souldiers of late being dismissed, and no new Regiments yet raised in their stead; Prince Maurice had scarce two thousand, wherewith to follow and observe the uncertain motions of the Enemy; But for supply thereof, the Souldiers out of France being eighteen Companies, were recalled, and soon came; In the interim, Barlot (with whom was present Prist in hope of the future Government of the Town) commanded some little Boats, which he caused to be brought from the next Castle in Flanders, through the ditches, in the night to be put into the Channel of the River; Barlotts Walloon, and Teslines German Regiments, being about fifteen hundred, of rather more, loaden with their Arms, and some few dayes Provisions, followed them with slippery steps, the place con∣sisting of a soft Clay, mingled with water. At last, being gotten aboard (for there were no Fords) they had a safe pas∣sage, wrought by their own silence, and the carelesness of the Holland Seamen, who as they dreaded no danger, so the neg∣ligent
and sloathful Watch, never offered to hinder, or stop with their Ship-Boats, which was easie to be done, the Ene∣my, while he was upon the Water; It was in vain to shoot or throw Darts in this darkness of the night, nor did the Guards get into the Town in time, for there being a little Fortification at the Bank, which thirty Souldiers were com∣manded to keep, as there was Reason, they, out of a rash bra∣ado, going out thence, and being killed, furnished the E∣nemy; then wanting Engines, and a place of safety and re∣treat, with boh; suddenly after followed a Fight, but it hap∣pening in the night, proved more confused, neither party be∣ing able to know which were Friends or Enemies, yet the Germans, at the very fist brunt, their Colonel Tescline being killed, who came along with Barlotte, turned their backs, and being in vain withheld, ran into the encreasing Waters (for it then flowed) and there met a cowardly and obscure death. But Barlotte with his men, by much labour and valour, resto∣red their Fortune, encouraging them to Honour with his words, and the Assaylants being compelled to return into the Town, both parts reported the number of the slain, to be greater than it was, each affirming themselves Conquerours; Count Solmes, because he had taken some Colours, and they, because they had some Prisoners: Some Souldiers, which Barlotte had left beyond the River, to assist and be as a supply to the Germans, being hired to swim over, were rewarded with the spoyls of such as were slain; Then was it, if any things lying nigh was, in that sudden and nocturnal attempt, possessed by the Enemy, that it happened (for within, there ra to and fro cross Banks, to prevent the over-flowings of the Rivers, in the same manner, as Prince Maurice had com∣manded them to be kept.) These things, as soon as they were noysed through Bra∣bant, both the Commanders by divers marches, tend to one and the same place.
The Prince, that he might drive out of the Isle this en∣creasing Company; the other, least those few who had en∣tred, should be destroyed, either by the multitude of the E∣nemies Forces, or by Famine; for they had no more Provi∣sions, than what they carryed upon their shoulders, there be∣ing no passage for Carts or Waggons: But Prince Maurice laboured in vain, to recover the lost places, because Roes had brought thither five Regiments from beyond the Scheldt, to wit, the Neopolitan, Walloon, and three Spanish Regiments, but not without great danger and some loss; with the rest of the Army, Albertus himself filled the further Banks: Prince Maurice remained at Cruning, in the utmost Borders of Ze∣land, sending from thence into the Town, as many Souldiers as he could possible; for the Zelanders earnestly conjured their Allyes, that they would not be neglectful of them, a∣gainst whom, both a valiant and victorious Army was com∣ing, and would lie upon them with all their force, wasting and spoyling their Country, although they would have all Provi∣sions from Gaunt, which is close at hand, and Antwerp not far off. Therefore, Souldiers were both raised and encouraged in the Cities beyond the Rhine, and in other places where hi∣therto they had been feared. The Guard of the Borders w committed to some fresh water Souldiers lately raised, who besides their Oath taken as Souldiers, were further obliged by half pay. Besides, it was decreed, that there should be Drums beat up in England, for the raising two thousand good Souldiers, the Queen being beseeched, that she would by her Authority, be contributary to their Assistance in this great necessity. But the King of France sought to for the same pur∣pose, that he would lay hold of this opportunity against his careless Enemy, and make some speedy incursions into his Territories, was backward in granting their Request, from some designs of peace, whereof he now began to hope.
In the mean time, the Spanish brought in by one side, and the Hollanders Horse by the other, filled the whole Country about Hulst, with sudden fear and slaughter: The Hollan∣ders had the greater strength, and as oft as the water over∣flowed the Fields, they passed backward and forward with their small Vessels unmolested. Then between the Town and the Castle adjoyning to the Town, which looketh toward the Scheldt, and so to the Enemy, slighting their Fortifications, they laid themselves open, by which mock or scorn, the Ene∣mies being provoked, as they pursued them seeming to fly, were cruelly shattered, and beaten by the Townsmens shot, and also a more compact and well ordered Sally: It was manifest, that these things happened for want of Cannon; without which no good could be done; and there was no small difficulty in the wafting them over the River: the more marishy places were by little and little, made firm with Fag∣gots, and other blushwood. In the Estuary, several Ships were bound, and tyed one to another so strongly, that they were as good as a Bridge, and at the furthest part of the Bank, served the Kings Forces like a Sconce, framed into the shape of a half Moon; from hence the great Artillery battered-both the Town and Castle. But at that time there were two, which had been brought at the first coming, into the very Island, and as any of the rest were brought over, they were planted immediatly against the Ene∣my. Afterwards, many others were brought thither, for se∣curity of the former, and Rouce attempted to take from the Hulstians a Fort, which was (as we said) to secure their Pro∣visions) and to cut off the use of the River from the Town, yet make it advantagious to themselves, which after it had not succeeded by several mean assaults, at length, with the Thunder of Cannons, and the noyse of Trumpets and Drums, whereby (as he openly confessed) he intended to strike at the same time, terrour into the Enemies, and infuse Courage into his own men, at midnight, he commanded the Italians to
go and break through the middle bank, possessed by the Ene∣my, which led from the Castle to the City. The darkness of the night was spent in wounds and slaughters, with a confu∣sed noyse, while the doubtful stroaks fall among the Croud, and there is no possibility to foresee or avoid them. In the morning, the Garrison was driven out; And in this interim, the Germans of the same side, that they might by po∣licy assist them in the assault, with great labour passing through the marishy and unguarded places, had won the outer Trench of the Castle, and cutting down the Palizadoes, fell upon the Watch, and killed them, not thinking of any dan∣ger from abroad: Thus keeping one part from the relief of the other, he became Conquerour of both, and all that day battered the Castle with his Cannon, which as it was princi∣pally strengthned with a Bank of moist plashy Earth, so was it easily beaten down; the Besieged therein, were no less than eight hundred, yet although the breach was not made wide enough, and they were sensible of no force near to assault them, feared nevertheless, the Bridge taken by the Enemy, and many other doubtful and unseasonable events of chance, but chiefly, by the commixture of those, who flying from the Battel in the night, and mingled themselves among them, and would not suffer one among them to remain honest and just: And throwing down their Arms, with horrible cla∣mours and threats, and force against their Commanders, if they could not consent forthwith to surrender. And just as the Count Solmes was bringing to them Relief, they marched out late in the Evening, being derided by their Enemies, and according to the merits of their cowardise, punished by their Commanders in chief; so highly oftentimes are the man∣ners and Customs of an Age corrupted, that the remedies of evils are more to be feared, than the evils themselves. The Spaniard having thus sooner, nay beyond his hope, obtained so easie an entrance against all stops, drained all the ground near the Trench, and from thence, what with Strata∣gems,
and what with force, he sorely battered all the Forti∣fications encompassed with the Trench: and also by the help of the Fort, could now secure the River, draw his Forces round the Town, and take order for encamping them: and which was as much as all this, by reason hereof, the prices of all things were abated, which the difficulty of transporting before, had made so scarce, that the Souldiers were much pinched with hunger. The Besieged laboured, and earnestly strove, by breaking down some water, to have let in an inundation upon their E∣nemies, but they found means to prevent the same, and turn∣ed all those Banks which they had gotten from the Towns∣men, to serve against them for present use: But they bending their whole study to procure eruption of the Water, made a Cave under their Walls, whereby they might drown them unawares; and after much slaughter, some Ensigns and Pri∣soners were taken, without harm to the Assaylants, while they took the Souldiers, either idle in their Quarters, or some∣times at play at Dice, which of late is become the passe-time of Military retirements and leysure; or, if they were forewarned by the Sallyers out-cryes, that a greater number came out, they would shun the danger, either by fighting at distance, and waveringly, or else by a lingring and flow re∣treat. The Cannon aid the greatest damage, together with Granadoes; for against all persons that came towards the City, there were empty Baskets set out for blindes, as well to hinder their sight, as to keep off their Darts; notwith∣standing all which, not onely they that were fain to expose themselves to danger in their continual attendance upon the batteries, were slain, but also not a few of the Commanders were in like manner killed; and among these, Rones, by whose advice all the noble actions of the Spaniards, atchieved in France, were managed, but that both the Archduke Alber∣tus, Fontayne, and the Duke of Parma, took the glory thereof to themselves, by commanding the same things,
He was by Nation a Lorrayner, and of a Noble Family, who, from the beginning of the French Commotions, follow'd the Party and Fortune of Francis de Valois. Afterwards, the Duke of Guise, observing him to be a man no less subtilly po∣litike, than truly valiant, and one that would not think any thing dishonest that was profitable, by great Gifts and Boun∣ty made him his own. In these last years, he had under-hand discover'd many of the Spanish Counsels to King Henry, as if his Affection banded towards him but, in truth, that he might hide his greater Aims: The Office of Camp-Master-Ge∣neral, being void by his Death, was bestow'd upon Herma Count Heremberg. But to proceed, The Townsmen were by their own streights compelled to fight, the Banks and Hills round about beholding them with a threatning Aspect, for Varas being General of the Ordnance under the Duke, had armed all those places with Cannon. Thus there was nothing cover'd, but their filthy biding places under Ground, or which lay under the Covert of the lofty Rampire: Count Solmes being wounded with a Shot in the Thigh, perform'd the Duties of his Command by Mes∣sengers, and Conference with the Collonels: And Prince Mau∣rice himself, from the Neighbouring Shore, had an Eye to∣wards all Things; so as whoever were wounded, or unable to bear Arms, being near fifty every day, were taken out of the Town, and plac'd in Hospitals, in the several adjacent Cities and Islands: Piron also a Collonel of Zealand, by continuall labour, and studious vigilancy, weakned and fallen sick, was licensed to depart. Supplies, and all other Things necessary for War or Provisions, were brought thither also from the same place first by the Care of Ernestus of Nassau, and after∣wards by Captain Dorpius: And the Garrison, by little and little, increased, till there were in the Town 36 Companies, and in Nassau's Fort 6 Companies: Besides, such plenty of Corn, that when they could not conveniently keep it within the Town, part of it was laid up in the Ships: But this was
hardly to be indured by the Enemy, that Ships should so fre∣quently pass to and fro, as in Trade, while he lay there in Siege: And therefore against the Port, they raised severall long Works, sometimes extending one way, anon turning another way, that so they might from thence infest the Haven with their Artillery; but for the most part in vain: For by the interposition of the Marishes, and long distance of place, the Shot was spent, before it came to the place, which it was intended to batter: And besides, the Enemy lay within reach of the Shot from Nassau Fort. And the flowing of the Sea, growing more violent, prov'd to them both an hindrance and damage. From thence, the Italians, under the Leading of the Marquess of Trevigiana, attaqued the Fortification, which Count Solms had lately made before the Gate of the Town, looking towards the Camp: First, they begun with plain and open force of Pioneers; but as soon as appearing out of the Trench, they found themselves gall'd with Shot, present∣ly raising two Breast Works, they inclosed their Flanks, and then began to shoot furiously, and the Italians soon after, climbing up to the very bottom of the Fortification, were thrown down in Fight; from whence again rising, by the Va∣lour of the Zelanders, thick showrs of Bullets, and casting of Wild-fire, they were totally put to flight. They had joyn'd to them some other Aids of other Nations, which stood every one separated by themselves, that so their Valour might be the better discerned. Nay, and a proper Band of Voluntiers was commanded to go forward, with not onely Military En∣signs display'd before them; but such as were wont to be used at Processions, and Solemn Times of Prayer appointed by the Church. This was an ordinary thing with the Spaniards of old, as often as they had War against any Profane or Barbarous Ene∣my; and because it is a Nation much addicted to the Cere∣monies of Religion, there is no surer way can be devised to encourage them. On the other side, the several Regiments
by turns, took care of the Guards, and the whole multitude of Towns-people became subservient to the War, bringing Darts to the Souldiers, and Faggots, Fire-Brands, and other Materials, both for Offence and Defence. Thus for three days, one after another, continued a sharp Fight, but with the greatest slaughter of the Assailants; for as the Souldiers of the first Rank, by reason of their heavy Armour, were like a Wall to the rest, their Arms not being penetrable by Shot, so if they were kept nigh at hand, for the avoiding of stroke, by their standing still, they hindred both themselves and others. At last, they fell from Force to Stratagems; the one, begin∣ning to undermine; the other, to countermine; so as the Da∣mage yet fell equally: There were some for the Assailants, who, partly by the plainness of the overturned Ground in one part, and partly by the rising thereof in another, were helped by the Slaughters both of their Friends and Enemies: But then did Death appear most terrible, when the Ground, made uneven by daily Graves, and slippery with Bloud, cau∣sed such as stagger'd thereon, that they could neither avoid to tread upon the sprawling Limbs of their Fellow-Souldiers, nor keep themselves from being annoy'd, though in the heat of Fury, by their dying spurns. Notwithstanding all which, the increasing Enemy drove the Defendants to Extremity; and lest, being the less follow'd, they might at once break through the Bulwark, which already began to lye open by Breaches, made with continuall Battery, there was raised more inwardly, by the Providential Care of Count Solms, a new Work in form of a Half-Moon, and with a deep Trench, whither was drawn together, a great strength of Souldiers to make resistance: Neither did the Spaniard keep long the use of that Fortification, which they had obtain'd with so much Labour and Bloud. For whatever remain'd thereof, the Besieged threw down by the force of Gun-powder from a Mine; and besides, in the void place, which lay between that and the Rampire, they had made a little lurking Hole,
from whose obscure mouth they shot against the Enemy, who hardly detecting the fraud, yet at last when discovered, they stopped it up, from doing further mischief; but when the Besiegers had stopped it up behind also first throwing fire therein, the repressed force thereof, at length burst out with th violence, that it overwhelmed with Earth divers of the Enemies: In the interim, they ceased not to drain all the rest of the Water out of the Trench, and to batter the Ram∣pire, with so much the more violence, because the breaches of the Walls were sustained by Palizadoes, decaying towards the bottom, and whereever at any time the Works grew de∣fective, the Townsmen brought thither Faggots, Wood and other heaps of things to amend of stop up the same: Nei∣ther was the Assaylants labour small against the mayn Bull∣wark, that reached to the ravelin at the Haven, which they be∣gan to batter without success; for the Gunpowder desti∣ned to that Work, being by chance fired, destroyed many of the by-standers, with so much Thunder and terrour, that it was heard beyond the Sea of Middleburg: At which time, either by reason of this chance, or else being otherwise wea∣ried, the Besiegers fury beginning somewhat to abate, a se∣lect party out of several Companies of Hollanders, to the number of six hundred, at open noon-day, that being the time of the Waters great ebbe, passed over the River, partly with Boats, and partly by the Fords, and attained the parts beyond the River, and then so suddenly slying into divers places, that they slew the Spaniards even within the Tren∣ches, wherein they lay fortified. The great Guns that were planted against them, as they sailed over the River, they clogged, because they could not bring them away, and presently after so beat down, and worst∣ed several Troops of Horse, and eight hundred Foot, that came to relieve their Fellows, or revenge their deaths, that they returned with very great Honour, and little or no da∣mage.
And after this, they made from other parts of the Town, many succesful Sallies: yet for all there things, the Spaniard continued to batter the Walls, and in one place had made a breach in the Bulwark, where there was not a more inward Work, though Prince Maurice had commanded one to be made there, the neglect whereof was excused by them that were guilty of it, by the Townsmens poverty, and Souldiers inability to undergo so many and great labours at once. Albertus, according to the Custom of War, sent another Summons to the Town, being in this Condition, denouncing against them great threats, unless they would surrender. Whereto receiving a couragious Answer, he yet durst not begin a new Assault, because in the former Skirmishes, he had lost above two thousand men; among whom, fell many Captains, and other Commanders, with the most vallant men, while they drew the Souldiers to prolong the Fight by their Example, striving to win to themselves, favour and Reputa∣tion with the new Governour; and also an incredible number of sick and wounded men, were scattered in the Fields, for the Neighbouring Cities would not entertain them, the hor∣ribleness of which Spectacle, made a mixture together of fear and pity. Therefore he endeavours to undermine the Rampire and Bulwark, but without any certain hope, so long as they daily saw fresh men brought into the Town; but Fortune soon after ridded them of this trouble; for some did advise, suspecting the lying still of so furious and active an Enemy, that they should endeavour to get from the Besieged, some Islands and Fords, whereby they might command the River and Ships; Others, that Ambushes should be laid to break into the City from the Trenches, whereby not onely the Front as heretofore, but the backside also should be ren∣dred unsafe; or else to give sudden Assaults upon the breaches: Thus fear inventing many things, first conceived in the brest of one, is afterwards made publick by voyce and
consent of others: whereupon, some who were eloquent presently said, that to begin to extoll the Enemies Forces and to undervalue their own, which had before in those days slighted their greatest Valour, was one of the greatest evills that could be: Hereupon, they go to Count Solmes, where at a frequent Consultation (and there were some who blamed that very thing, that he had not advised with them, or some choyse men) a Captain perswading a Surrender used these, or the like words. [If the greatest documents of Vertue, had not been published for this place, I my self should yet doubt, whether we could walk in is more ready way to Honour: That fame is unjust, which will not be satisfied; How often have we sustained the shock of the E∣nemies fury powred out upon us? how oft have we voluntarily fallen upon them? But alas, instead of being diminished, he ra∣ther encreaseth by the slaughters we make of him. We cannot receive so great Supplies as will answer the losses we suffer in being victorious; What have we gotten by this whole Months fighting, but the beating down of our Fortifications about the Town, and to devide our voyd works with the Enemy, and all our wast ground is taken up by making new defences within the former: What do we stay for therefore? Do you look for an Army to come, to drive the Enemy out of their Trenches and Leaguer, whom they could not keep off? Far be from you such a vain expectation: for France, and the furthest parts of the World, withhold our hopes; We are here fifteen hundred, who are daily called out to fight, the rest being either dead or wounded: We are besieged with twenty thousand, with whose very Arms we may be over-whelmed: What should I mention, the Ambushes and Snares hidden under ground, from which, no Vertue nor Valour can be safe; but we must perish without either defence or revenge; Truly we have been instructed by our Ancestors, that a valiant man will never slight apparent and visible dangers, nor do rash persons merit to be praysed as wise, while they seek a certain, but not an honourable grave; But now there is a far greater difference between us and
our Enemies: We, furnished onely with a few Companies, think by the chearfulness of our Obedience, to supply the defects of our number. They Powerful, exceeding Wealthy, prodigall of their Souldiers lives esteeming it costs but lietle, that is bought onely with blood. And who would desire to have him become an Enemy, who so lavishly wasts his Friends? But miserable is the poor Souldier, who having so oft with contempt, even looked death in the face, if yet at last he should not deserve to live; Rather let us take heed for the benefit of our Country, least while we defend a small part so stifly, the rest be left open to the same fury. Let him then be Su∣periour, whom we cannot but acknowledge more potent. Let him have the ground so sated with the blood of his followers: They will have no great cause to boast of this Victory, which hath robbed us of so many famous Leaders, and such a multitude of common Soul∣diers.] This accurate defence of fear, did not work upon all one Matthias Helly, being the chief of the resisters, cryed out; [This is altogether anew mischief of War, to desert the Works be∣fore they are assaulted, and to intreat a safe passage from the E∣nemy, out of that place, from whence yet they were able to make good their defence, rather let some time be taken for deliberation in which interim, they might keep out the Enemy, by repairing their Works, or else by force and Sallies beat him off valiantly, untill they could receive further advice and directions from Prince Maurice and the States, the Prince lying but in the next Island, full of care for the Town, not expecting from thence any such newes.] For all this, safety was preferred by all the valiant men, and Count Solmes, who a little before had promised the Prince, to hold the Town to the utmost extremity, and was encouraged by Letters, and Promises from the States to the same purpose, now fearing the Souldiers rashness, or else as it is experimentally observed, that generous Valour, which in Field-Fights is undanted, and not Conquerable, is not able in a Siege to endure the toyls and miseries of War,
thought it fit to hasten the Surrender, left the Condition and State of Affairs within the Town, should be discovered by the Treachery of any Renegadoes. They themselves in a man∣ner, prescribed their own terms of delivery; which Albertus consented to with the greater joy, by how much it came so unexpectedly, and beyond his hopes. About the end of August, when the Siege had devoured no less than threescore Officers, and near five thousand Soul∣diers, Hulst was delivered to Albertus, together with Nassau Fort, not so much as defaced in the least manner, during the whole Siege; the rest of the Fortifications upon that Coast, the Garrison Souldiers that were therein, when they sled, did overthrow and destroy. The Hollanders took very heinously the loss of this Town, by which they had compelled the Pro∣vince of Flanders, to bear a part of their burdens, in paying them Tribute. Besides, they were possessed with great fear of the victorious Army, for that the greatest part of the year yet remained fit for Service; and what City would Hand out against them, if the touching of their Works by the Enemy, were enough to fright them into a Surrender, and if three thousand men durst not put off, and delay the Enemy by skir∣mishing and fighting? The multitude hereupon, murmured cruelly against Count Solmes, as become effeminate with the carasses and amours of his Lady, and as if they would be pleased, to have one guilty person sacrificed to the publick Calamities. Nor did the Zelanders defer to remove him from the Command of their Regiments, being now  pleas∣ed with him, because he had of late behaved himself impe∣tiously among them: professing they wanted his help no fur∣ther, and dissembling the rest of their anger. But he being conscious to himself, answered the same both by word and writing, as he heard thereof, excusing his actions by necessi∣ty: so that he obtained from the confederate States, a new Regiment, they of Zeland not opposing the same.
At which time he protested, that having been in the War for the Hollanders, during the space of thirteen years, he had always resolved, for the publick good, to pardon all the in∣juries he could receive from any particular persons. The Cardinall Albert was received with extraordinary applause of all his followers, because the Austrian Family was not barren of Valour and Vertue, and that he being the restorer of Flanders and the French limits, after seven years, had then perfected their returned felicity with a treble Victo∣ry, and once more made their good Fortune permanent to them. Thus at present, they shewed nothing but content and joy, but the future did not continue to them the same hopes. The War thus speedily ended, when the consumed Soul∣diery on both sides, and the exhausted Treasury should have given rest to the remainder of the year: he cast both his mind and eyes to the enlarging his bounds otherwise: sending Francisco Mendoza to the Emperour his Brother, to desire of him many things in the Kings Name; As, [That Besancos claiming liberty to it self, under the Reverence due to the German Empire, might be restored to that Burgundy which is subject is the Spaniards. That the Citizens of Aquisgrave, might be com∣pelled to submit to the Decree, which commanded the Magistrates to receive the Catholick Religion, and from thenceforth to forbid all Novel Rites of Religion. That as to the Ansiatike Cities, He would not suffer the English unpunished, to infest the Sea by Py∣racy. And that the Spaniard, for the listing and raising of Soul∣diers in Germany, might be assisted by publick Authority, which hitherto had been allowed but by permission.] But the chief hopes of the Spaniard were removed a great distance into the Dutchy of Cleves and Juliers, where the Wife of the mad Duke, being struck suddenly dead, had with new jealousies and suspitions, inflamed the old discords.
The Counsellors retained the Government, against the wills of most of the Native Noblemen, enjoying the benefit of their false report, that the Duke, was recovered: These, be∣cause they ordained for the Duke, another Wife of the Fa∣mily of Lorraign, were believed to have wished and plot∣ted the death of the former, and now while the Spanish Af∣fairs prospered, arrived to that pitch of pride, that they com∣manded the Procurators of the Marquess of Brandenburg, and the Palatine of Newburg, to depart out of their Territories; and besides, they sent to the United States, with great de∣manding, if they expected ought from them. The States knowing their own imbecility, and their Ene∣mies strength, modestly answered, that they were Friends, both to the Marquess of Brandenburg, and the Palatine of Newburg; yet nevertheless, they would observe peace with them, so long as they remained within the rights of Peace; yet wished them to be advised, lest they fetched forreign Forces out of Germany, to their great damage: Soon after, they accused and prepared to degrade from his Honour Count Brugny, and several others of the Protestants, as guilty of a Plot against them: And at the same time, sent to excuse themselves to Albertus, that they were compelled to dis∣semble many things, and to defer them until more seasona∣ble and happy opportunities: And Mendoza had brought it to passe, that these mens Authority was confirmed by the Emperours Decree; And when they requested more, in an∣swer whereto the Emperour declared, that He himself feared to give offence to the Protestants, whose Ayd and Assistance would be very necessary for him in his War against the Turks; Mendoza replyed, that remote Wars ought so to be minded, that in the mean while, neerer injuries should not be tolera∣ted. And now the Spaniard admits a discourse of Peace, be∣ing very acceptable to Germany, though without any Reason, or hope from himself; And Albertus wrote to King Philip to that purpose.
Whereupon the Emperour sent to the States a Nobleman, to require safe Conduct for some Embassadors that were to come thither; which when they excused, the Spaniards were, from their own words, charged with the Envy of the refused Peace; yet did Albertus keep the people obedient to him  whit the less, by the hope of Settlement. While all these Accidents happen in and about the Ne∣therlands, in the interim, a Fleet of English and Hollander (which I spoke of before) passed up and down the Spanish Seas victorious: The cause of sending it was, because it ap∣pear'd to the Queen, that the Spaniards had gather'd together a great Navy, wherewith he intended to take some Pole in France, or near thereabout. Nor were the Threats vented  years before quite forgotten; and that the Earl of Tyrone then Rebelling in Ireland, was greatly assisted and incourag'd with the hope of Spanish Supplyes: And thereupon it was thought very necessary, because both the charge and occasion offer'd it self, to divert those Forces raised and prepared for Defence of her Borders against he procrainating Enemy. In this Fleet there were drawn together 16 of the Queens great Ships, and 40 lesser Ships, all fit for War; whereto were added 50 more for carrying Souldiers, and transporting Provisions: Reb Earl of Essex was made General of all the Land-Forces, a person in great favour with the Queen, for the Honour of his Age. The Charge of the Fleet was committed to the Lord Charls Howard, the Admiral thereof; both of them had equal power and authority; which Thing hath ever been observed preju∣dicial to Enterprises of that Nature, and to have damnified them, and hindred their Success. They were both of very unsuitable Dispositions; Essex, in a Youthful Heat of Bloud, seeking to get to himself both the Honour and Name of Chief Captain, was wont to force the Queen into Arms, un∣der the Notion of Danger; though she her self, as a Woman, endeavour'd to avoid Expences: And, that the Fleet might
the more honourably proceed, he expended therein no smal matter of his own Estate; himself shewing the way to his Relations and Familiars, that they might follow his Example. Howard being a person more wary of managing Affairs, by reason of his Age, tended to the contrary, and endeavour'd by all means he could, to delay the going out of the Fleet: And when it was ready, he had perswaded the Queen, that she would admonish Essex by her Letters, that he would desist from that dangerous Ʋndertaking and that she would re-imburse him what he had laid out. But he because he was not plainly forbidden, answer'd, That he would proceed in his Voyage, and doubted not his good Fortune. Nor did he refuse his Emulator, to be equal with him in Command, knowing, that his own Authority was greater with the Sea-men; and that he, upon any Mis∣carriage, should be less blamed where all Things were done with a Companion. And besides, under pretence of Honour, he had won as many Noble-men as he could to go with him, who, he knew, had no kindness for him; lest, in his absence, they should do him greater damage at home. There were ad∣ded to both of them as Counsellors, several great Souldiers, and no Order should be effectual, but what was approved by the consent of the greater part of them. The Queen's princi∣pal Care was, That they should fall upon the Spanish Fleet, that was set out against England or Ireland, and destroy whatever they met to that intent. Moreover, And if they could intercept the Ships coming from the Indies, or elsewhere, the Prey therein taken should be the Reward of their well-deservings. The Ships set out by the Hollanders, and the rest of the League were in number 24. the greatest part of which were well fitted and prepar'd for War; the Admiral whereof was John Duvenvord Warmondt, to whom, next to the Prince, the chief Command, in Sea-Affairs, through Holland was com∣mitted. Also, there were some selected men out of the English Regiments, then in Pay in the Low-Countries, sent aboard, which indeed were the strength of the Fleet, and a
Pattern to the Fresh-water Souldiers. And the States wil∣lingly consented to it, that they might by such a Friendly Of∣fice, please the incensed Queen, although they fear'd the Evils. which afterwards hapned, upon their want of Money. Lewis of Nassau, the Son of Jehu and Cozen-German to Philip and Ernestus, going with those Souldiers, laid before them famous Rudiments of Vertue and Valour. The 23 day of June, the great Commanders determin'd early to depart from Plymouth, with Order, To meddle or sight with none but Spaniards, or People subject to the Spaniards, or such as furnished them with Ships, Guns, Souldiers, or Provi∣sions; And that all other People might safely go about their Af∣fairs, whether they would follow the Fleet or depart to Sea; with promise of Impunity, to all that would forsake them, and come over to the English. All the hope and preparation of this Fleet, was rather to look after Prey, than to fight; because being far from Home, far from any Assistance, among their Enemies Countries, the danger of the Sea, and their Passage subject to Storms and Tempests, no delay could be safe enough. Nor do old Chro∣nicles alone teach this, and the Portugall Voyage not long since undertaken, but the success of the very former year in America, which fell so far short of expectation: And there∣fore, those Things seem'd rather to be put in Execution, which would, by their suddain violence, in no small manner, terrifie and break the Enemies strength; and they were not resolved in what part to set upon them, a little before they came to Cadiz. At length, by private Letters, all the Na∣vy was commanded to meet there: These Letters, close seal∣ed and signed, the Captains received, with this Order, The they should not open them, unless they were by foul Weather sepa∣rated from the Fleet. This most noble City of Cadiz, from its very first Original (when many say it was call'd Tartessus) and afterwards a Colony of the Tyrians, was said to be the furthest part of the
World: Neither will it suffice to shew, that it was now far decay'd from its antient Opulency. The Scituarion thereof, with other Things belonging to the same, hath been described by many. At this day, it is beholding to a Bridge, which they call Suaca, for making it no Island; for that joyneth it to the Coast of Spain, separated there from onely by a small Inlet of the Sea: On which side, the Name of the Region testifies, that formerly the Vandals inhabited there: Beyond is that Streight, where first the Ocean broke in upon, and di∣vided the Land: On this side is a convenient Bay, for the Reception and Safety of Ships: And then, by chance, a great Fleet lay under the Defences of the Island, which was partly prepar'd for the American Voyage, and partly furnish'd for War, which had not so much increased the difficulty for the English to land, as it had their Expectations, to the hope of a most plentiful and rich Booty. There were four Galeoons, two of Epidaurus, every one of them carrying fifty Guns, or more, and near 700 men: Of the Kings own Ships of War, there were 21. and as many Merchants Ships, which carryed 20 Guns a piece: Three Frigats, each of them beating 18 Guns, and laden with more for use of the Fleet, that was at Lisbone, and other Ports of Spain; for this Fleet here was on∣ly the Third Part of the Spanish Naval Force. There were then also 50 Sail of other Ships belonging to private persons, come both from Spain, Italy, and other parts, which were ei∣ther unarm'd, or but weakly furnish'd: And not far off from the City, lay 21 long Ships more. The Earl of Essex earnestly desir'd to fall upon them, while they knew not what to do, and before their fear should decay or grow less, lest he might give them time, either to take counsel, or gather strength; which if he could have perswaded others to effect, (and in∣deed the Hollanders were willing to have assisted him) they had then gotten infinite Honour, together with an inestima∣ble Booty.
But the Lord Admiral Howard was afraid to suffer in Ships committed to his Charge, especially those of the Queens, which she had forbidden to be rashly brought into danger, to come into that narrow Streight of Sea, which was full of dangerous Shelves and Quick-Sands, because the Wind blew a little high. Thus, by delaying the time, they lost their Opportunity. The next day, being the first of July, the Ebbe of the Sea hindred them, that they could not come to fight. Upon the left hand, as you enter into that Streight, is the Royal Port, so called; hither the Spanish Ships had withdrawn themselves, excepting onely the Galeoons, and Long Ships, which remain'd nearer to the City, where the Shore runs out into Linga, which the Inhabitants call Punta. But Sir Francis Vere setting upon these with some lighter Vessels, and soon after the Earl of Essex pressed forward, that they forced them to the Bridge Suaca, and there an Engine being placed, they were lifted over, that so they might get into the Streight, or escape into the Sea, that lyes more inward from thence. Essex and Howard, for 4 hours together, batter'd the Galeoons; and that the more violently, for that the Flood of the Sea increa∣sing had brought them nearer; and it hapned at this time, that a Holland Ship, by the negligence of Captain Peter Henry, perishing in her own fire, and the Gun-powder she carryed, yielded to the Enemy a short cause of rejoycing for presently the Galeoons not daring to stand out the fight, cur∣ting their Cables, fell upon the Sands, all the Sea-men esca∣ping. Part were carryed away, and part burned, either by themselves, or their Enemies; at which time also one of the English ships was burned. And this strook no small Terrour into the Spaniards, that were wont to confide in the great Bulk of their Ships; so as King Philip receiving News here∣of by a peculiar Messenger, presently sent to Naples, Genoa, and Sicily, That they should immediatly send what great Ships they had to the Relief of Cadiz; And the Assistance also of the Knights of Malta was demanded: But the French that were
there in service, urged and insisted on the contrary. After the Sea-fight, the Earl of Essex, the day now declining, landed his Souldiers at Puntal without resistance; and the Holland Mariners having taken a Castle that lay upon the Sea, set up their Ensign thereon. Others also were sent, to break the Bridge Suaca, lest any Relief should come that way, which accordingly they performed: All the Spanish Noble-men, that lived thereabouts, came to the Defence of the City with 600 Foot, and as many Horse: Against whom was sent Lewis of Nassau, with 400 Spear-men, and a Band of English Volun∣tiers; nor was the Fight long against them, being unaccu∣stom'd to Matters of War: At the first Onset being routed, and flying to the City in no order; They were follow'd by the Conquerours, who, while the Terrour remain'd fresh, entred the City, part over the Walls, and other part by the Gates, which they had how forced open. The People of Cadiz, at the beginning trusted to the Tops of their Houses, which were flat, from thence casting stones down upon the Enemy, as they were scatter'd in the Streets, not a few at a time, but as it were by whole Loads. Anon, when the Court and the Market-place were possessed, here the Townsmen all ran together into the Castle; there two Com∣panies of Souldiers follow'd, but staid not long in it, because they understood the Passage to them was shutting up by the Bridge, which we before mention'd: Whereupon the chief persons of the City being given for Pledges, they redeem'd their Lives onely for One Hundred and Twenty Thousand Ducats: And these Pledges being soon after carryed into England, in regard the Queen would not suffer them to be Ransom'd, being provoked with new Injuries, dyed in Pri∣son. There was also a Treaty between the Earl of Essex, and one Peter Herrera, a Spanish Merchant, for redeeming the Town and Ships from spoil, for the Sum of Twenty Hundred Thousand Florens, whereto Essex was consenting, as discer∣ning
the Prey would be imbezill'd and wasted by the Soul∣diers, and serve for the future to no purpose; but the Duke of Medina Sidonia would not allow of that Agreement, being the Supervisor of all the adjacent Coast, chusing rather, that the King should be despoiled of his Fleet, and Ten Thousand Citizens outed of their Estates and Fortunes, supposing that then to be Gain in the midst of Damage, if nothing after∣ward accrewed to the Enemy: and therefore the Town was spoiled, no small Damage alighting upon the Merchants of Holland thereby; many of whom were by long Voyages in∣termingled with the Enemy, who esteemed this Loss at Three Hundred Thousand pounds. And moreover, a Holland Ship, which came over to the English, upon the Credit of Procla∣mation, had Fifty thousand Florens taken from her, upon pre∣tence, that it was the Enemies Money. And the Americas Fleet, well laded with Merchandize, and consisting of Two and Thirty Sail, was burned by the Spaniards, together with some Ships of War that were for their Convoy. The Com∣modities there burned, amounted to no less value than One Hundred Thousand Florens. Here the Commanders differ'd in Judgment, Essex advising, to retain their Victory, while the greatness of the Report upon a suddain, should strike such a Terrour into all the Neighbouring Ports, and even in Sevil it self, that they might dig through the Streights; which be∣ing taken away, the City it self would be made an Island; protesting, That he himself would be ready, if the rest would go away, with four hundred Souldiers, either to perform for his Country an eminent and noble piece of Service, or else, that he would valiantly dye in the Enemies Country; and if they had no other Reward for their stay, than the Preyes of Ships, passing through those Streights, that they may go the next way into Africa and Europe, it would certainly amount to an immense Revenue. But the Lord Admiral Howard, pretending to fear scarcity of Provisions, hindred Essex his Glory, whose Honour and
Wealth, gotten at the taking of Cadiz, was never any where equalled with the like Naval Success. And it was true, that the English going from Home with no great store of Provisions, had yet profusely, and unadvi∣sedly wasted, even in the City, what would have sufficed them for many days. Neither would the Dutch Admiral War∣ be hearkned to, offering to the Fleet a Moneths Provi∣sion out of his own Ships; and that, in the mean time, as the Wind favour'd, Provisions might be fetched, either out of Italy or England; and he believed (as he said) That the Peo∣ple of Carthage, who maintain War constantly against the Spani∣ards, would not refuse to furnish them. Notwithstanding all which Advice, first setting the Town on fire, they hoysted Sails: And although Essex did again demonstrate, That the Plate-Fleet coming from America, was not far off, bringing no less than threescore and ten hundred thousand Florens; and that there was another going to the Indies, bring as it were a Booty pre∣pared for them, if, next after Cadiz, they would, which he concei∣ved best to go to the Islands of Azores, not far from the Line, (which the Netherlanders call the Isles of Flanders, because they say they were of old inhabited by the People or their Country) all Succour being intercepted, by the speedy Expedition and Report of the Matter. But other Advices were prefer'd, which oftentimes under the Vizor of an over-careful Provi∣dence and Fore-sight, do many times vitiate, if not ruine, the most noble and valiant Undertakings. And the same Envy, as before, pretending danger of the Ships, and want of Vi∣ctuals, would not suffer him with the Fleet, to touch upon any of the obvious parts of Spain: So that they passed by so great an open Shore, and almost void of Towns, doing no∣thing but dishonourable Pyracies. Thus it came to pass, that the spoil and burning of the City of Cadiz, could not have been the least of his Actions, when the whole Land and Continent of Spain, offer'd it self to be
spoiled, if it had not been defer'd, by the never agreeing Minds of men equl in Authority; so that Fortune had in vain thus far flatter'd the Earl of Essex. They praised also the Industry of the Dutch-men, whom they were not willing to make use of; yet the Queen sent Letters to Admiral W∣mondt, wherein she gave him Thanks for his faithful and good Service: Nor did it a little augment the Trouble of the Spa∣niards, for their decaying Wealth, that their Fleet was burn'd at Cadiz; all the Tribute and Customs of the following year were lost, his strength at Sea much diminish'd, about Twelve Hundred great Guns lost and consumed; and, which was worst of all, it was made known to the World, how weak they were at Home, that were so much fear'd abroad. As an Addi∣tion to all which Losses, that old Evil of Usury, eat up all the publick Revenues: For Philip, Twenty years before, having much impair'd his Credit, while he was yet intangled in the Dutch War, not depressing his ambitious Things, after the Kingdoms belonging to others, nor comparing his infinite Disbursements, with his ordinary Income, by nourishing too covetous Endeavours, wherein Fortune proved various, he brought upon himself Poverty. For the greatest part of the King's Creditors suspecting his potency, onely some Mer∣chants of Genoa and Germany, much improved their Money, by the hazard of Commerce, and dealing with him, To these were given in Pledge as Security, almost all the Customs, who reckoning all the Hazards, both of War and the Sea, the incommodiousness of Transportation, and also infinite Use and Extortion for their Money, did, for a long time, prevent the coming in of the Revenues to the King's use. Thus, his Treasury bring besieged, as it were by his Credi∣tors, from whence he should place and displace Officers, or at leastwise bear the Charge of his Wars, nothing came to the King, until some Polititians of his Court, rather careful for the present, than provident for the future, invented a way, though
not very honourable; which Advice, the King laying hold of, in the Moneth of November, he set forth an Edict, wherein declaring, with many Circumlocutions, the grievousness of the Usury he suffer'd; insomuch that Husbandry ceased, and Merchandizing was left off: That the Customs of the King∣dom, the Tenths of Priests, granted to him by the Pope, and the Tributes of several Nations, were all detained by most unjust Covenants, which the fear of worse Evils had extort∣ed: And in regard that ail his many Labours, in behalf of Christianity, would be perverted, unless some speedy course were taken, to supply or prevent those Necessities. Where∣fore, without any other pretence of words, he declared, That whatsoever had been by him pawned, or laid to pledge, was abso∣lutely free from every such Obligation: So that he presently laid hold of all his Possessions, leaving to the Usurers, at the pre∣sent, nothing but hopes: Adding withall this Proviso, That whatsoever had been paid above lawful Interest, should be dedu∣cted from the Principal. In the mean while, a great many were stripped of their Wealth, though some, under a false pretence of Poverty, abused it to great advantage: And this same Calamity, for the like Reasons, fell also upon some in the Netherlands. The Arch-Duke hereby was surprized with such a want of Money, that the next year he suffer'd by it most inexplica∣ble Damage: So that at last all came to his wonted course; not so much for shame of the Creditors, who cryed out, There was no Faith left, if the Royal Power would take upon it self the infringement of Covenants; as because the Names of the Revenues coming in were various, and where hence Money should be brought, the Ways were infested with Thieves, and the Charges of the War required a present Remedy. But this could not be obtained, before the Promises and Engagements were renewed by the Restauration of the Pawns, and pro∣mise to pay every Moneth Eighteen Thousand Duckets, and adde to the old Bank Four Hundred more; the Third Part
of which to be paid in Spain, and the Residue in the Nether∣lands, by Bill of Exchange. But, among the Hollanders, as the Dearth and scarcity of Provision in Italy decreased, so did their Revenues, both publick and private: For supply where∣of, the Hollanders, besides their old Taxes, lately increased an Eighth Part, imposed a new one, whereby they might restrain Riot and Excess daily increasing, or else bring the Gain thereof to the publick Advantage. There was a Rate set upon all those that sold Silk, and other such like pretious Commo∣dities for Garments. But when as the Collector began to put in Execution the said Tax, at first the People began to rail with scurrilous Language; but afterward they fell to open force and blows. They, who without grudging, underwent the burden of daily Provision for Extraordinaries, yet strove a∣gainst this, as if it had bin for their Liberty. But this seem'd a Reproach, not a Tribute; for the Contumacy of some so witstood the publick Authority, that it appear'd unsafe, to incline to the contrary: But, in Frizeland, they who had the charge both of the Cities and the Country, not yet agreeing, while every one defends his Possessions against the payment of Tributes, they made it evident, with what Diseases chiefly the Common-wealth may be afflicted, where there is not likewise a common profit. But the chief care of the Nobles, was bent to settle and confirm a League between themselves and the French and English; for hitherto they had given As∣sistance one to the other at request, and their own pleasure; which had sometimes been the cause of Complaints among them, and on all sides produced Threats, tending to the breach of Peace. But the Hollanders, who had perpetual cause of War, and, as for the most part, such Alliances overstrain the Inferiours, while their Forces were at War in France, or at Sea with the English, lost Hulst, and all the Tributes grow∣ing out of Flanders, no man caring for their Griefs or Los∣ses. In the mean while, the French not dissembling concerning
Calais, and the Succours sent too late, complainad, That the King's Confidence was deluded, who, lying at the Siege of Fayer with his own Forces, fear'd the danger of no part less than of the Sea-Coast. And their Courage was heightned from de Maiu, and others of that Faction, who had preferred the King's Pardon, before the Commerce of Foreign Pride: And now the great Council of the whole Kingdom of France be∣ing summon'd at Roan, there appear'd the lawful Face of a Kingdom: Nor was there any great aversion in King Philip, from hearkning to Pacification; which as it was true, so that he should marry the King of France his Daughter, was first onely a Spanish Device; a little after strengthned with a false umour. But Queen Elizabeth, the Counts of Bulloin and Sancy, being sent Embassadors to her from France, at such time as Albertus had taken Calais, at first shew'd her self very strange towards them, as if she could very ill spare to lend them five and twenty thousand Scutes: But shortly after, taking a nearer view of the danger, of her own accord, she not onely kept the Embassadors with her, but treated with them of a more set∣led League, the Conditions and Articles whereof were then begun to be discoursed of. In the interim, the talk of Peace more and more increasing, the King signified to the Ʋnited States, (and by that Name, they being much troubled, that the King had changed his Religion) that he was so high in the Pope's Favour, that he accepted of him to be a Moderator and Reconciler of Differences in Religion; nor was it a wonder, if he endeavour'd to win the Minds of the Vulgar, by the pretence of Peace: But if the League was confirm'd, he would be ready to invade the Borders of Artois with 8000 men, which was beyond the strength of his Nobility. But for all this great ostentation: when, at the Siege of Hulst, a little after, such an Action would have been most acceptable, the French never so much as made an offer to stir. And besides, Count Bulloin being return'd home, and again to be sent into
England, for conclusion of the League, was detained Three Moneths: And there was at this time a Truce agreed be∣tween the Garrisons of Calais and Bulloin; all which Things the French excused thus: That they were not able to bring forth their Army, because the French Nobility are always wont to rest themselves from all Actions Military in time of Har∣vest; and not onely so, but the Netherlandish Border: also were visited with the Plague; That the League was delay'd onely, while it might be fully deliberated in all the French Parliaments, and that the Truce was quickly broken off. But the Hollanders had more to do with Queen Elizabeth, who now, for two years together, had required them to come to an Account, and re-imburce her Money; enumerating, the Successes of the War, not without a shew of Emulation, and the stately structures of their Cities: And, on the other side, declaring her own Necessities, which she could not supply with continual Veins of Mettal, as the Spaniard did, but only from the Love and Benignity of her Subjects: And the Irish Rebellion, as it inforced the new raising of Money at Home; so likewise it necessitated her to call in what she had abroad: On the other side, the Dutch Embassadors, first rendring many Thanks, beseeched her to stand to the League; complaining, That they had had but a short Benefit of those Things, which had bin agreed 12 Years before: And that the Covenants did not set down any set number of Souldiers; whereupon they, who as they never had stagger'd in their Fidelity, nor had inclined to the War with wavering Counsels, yet had bin, by the uncertainty of Forces, oftentimes revolved unto vain Attempts; and that this was very unseasonable in the heat of War, to expect that, which did not begin to be a debt, until there were a Peace setled, as by the Agreement will ap∣pear: That their Condition was not so much alter'd, but that they still deserv'd rather Pity, than Envy: For besides the rich Cities of Brabant, they had lost certain Towns at the Maes, and particularly, those which were most convenient both by
Sea and Land, for raising and collecting the Flandrian Tri∣butes. Nor had they bin at a small charge, after the driving away the Spanish Fleet from England, in so many Naval Expe∣ditions of the English; and to what end had they assisted France, but that the War might be repelled, and the Seas be kept open, while the Enemy was imploy'd at Land. Hereto was added the Shipwracks they had suffer'd, the restriction or taking of their Ships, the breaches of their Banks by the Sea, and other daily Evils they had undergone, by Misfortunes and Casualties. Concerning these Things, there was a long Argument with Bodley, who was Leiger for the Queen among the Hollanders, concerning the Dutch Affairs: Notwithstand∣ing all which, Queen Elizabeth grew every day more obdu∣rate, till at length she was mollified by procrastination, but chiefly by the Supplies they sent to her for the Cadiz Voy∣age. But no sooner was the benefit of that Kindness consum'd, but presently the same Contest was again renew'd, and Seba∣stian Lose, James Valquy, and Abel Franken, being sent Em∣bassadors into England, the Queen gave them this short An∣swer; That, that was not the intent of the League, that the Hol∣landers should prolong a War against themselves, on purpose to delay, without measure or end, the payment of those Charges, by others disbursed for them. And as to the Peace they hoped, if it proved disadvantageous to them, neither had it been profitable to her those 12 years, having both for that time, and hitherto ehau∣sted both her self and her people, in sending them perpetual Aids, and keeping the Towns deliver'd to her for a Pledge. And what kind of Alliance must that be, whose very Branch must depend upon the pleasure of another? But if they would look upon the Laws as the Queen was pleased to do, she would urge nothing fur∣ther than was in them: That it was truly so conceived, Words of Promise, upon Honour, were plighted.
The Lord Burghly added also, the Irish Rebellion, and the proper fears of England, were Causes just enough, why the Queen might fall off from those Agreements, when even private Promises are wont to be absolved, upon unexpected Events. Therefore, this Debate of Right being in vain, and but for a shew made use of, the Hollanders ran back to their old Guard, shewing the danger they should incur from all their Neighbouring Dominions, if the strength of their Cities already weakned, should be utterly dejected by such De∣mands, and so much both of Wealth and Power by Sea added to the Spaniards: But above all, when the dubious state of the matter, and so discordant in the setling the Account of Receipts and Disbursements, had almost brought them to a Non-plus: The English urged the payment at least of some part of the Debt; and, for the future, not to seek a Remedy against growing Danger, from old Covenants, as by Compul∣sion; but rather to merit new Favours by their Gratitude and Thanks for the former. The Embassadors, with many hum∣ble Intreaties, offer'd, That there should be an Annual Portion paid, notwithstanding all their present streights, and the resi∣due, at the end of the War; which the Queen slighted as inconsiderable, while in the interim, a great fearspread it self, arising from a Rumor, that there was Hostility intended against her in Spain; and that the preparations there made, to that purpose, were greater than ever before. Hereupon the Wise of those times, began seriously to consider of both Af∣fairs, and judged, that the Hollanders were not so much op∣pressed with Poverty, but that it would oblige them to the Queen in a strict Alliance, especially considering the danger of so great a Loss, and that the Queen might at some time want Money, they might well bear, unless their Counsel could put the Hollanders, now tyred with importunate De∣mands, in mind of her Power, it being not to be suffer'd, that her Debtors should raise themselves to a more prosperous Fortune by Foreign Amities.
Now the Count of Bulloyne was sent into England, to con¦clude the long Treaty of a League between the two King¦doms, which was at last agreed upon, in manner following: The League and Alliance, concerning infring or resisting Wars, between, or upon the King of France, and the People of England, is concluded under these Articles and Conditions. That all former Leagues and Covenants be confirmed; That both shall endeavour to bring other Princes and Nations into the same League: And when either shall be offended, or invaded at Home, that one common Army of the Allies, shall transferre the War into the Enemies Country; That it shall not be lawfull for either Kingdom without the other, to make either Peace, or a Ge∣neral Truce: That either shall assist the other with Arms, and other things necessary for War among themselves, at a reasonable price, and without fraud, and aid the Souldiers with all Provi∣sions without Treachery; That all things relating to Religion, and Travellers of either Country, be used no otherwise, than as naturall Subjects; That the King of France use no violence to any Eng∣lish for difference in Religion; and in regard he was at the pre∣sent most subject to the Injuries of his Enemies, the Queen promi∣sed him four thousand English Souldiers, for the Defence of Normandy and Picardy, which are the nearest parts of France to her Kingdom, giving them half a years Pay, and taking Pledges: But if they were kept any longer there, it should be at the King's Charge; Who, on the other side, promised the like Aid to the Queen, so as they should remain near the Shore, or within fifty Leagues; That it may be lawful to raise and take into Pay four thousand men, and the Command of the Souldiers to be in that Prince, within whose Borders the War is. These were the Heads that were publickly known; for by some private Agreements, the number of Souldiers the Queen was to send this year was lessned. To the performance of this League the Queen was sworn. And the Earl of Salisbury went to see the King take the like Oath on his part. From hence the Count of Bulloyn went into Holland, to receive their consent
and submission. At the confirmation of this League were pre∣sent there, Paul Busanual, who was the King's continual Lei∣ger with the States, and George Gilpin an English-man, and an Assistant in the Senate by the old League. After Prince Mau∣rice and the Senate's Advice had, the United States were also included within the same words, onely there were added these peculiar Things; [That the King of France, at the begin∣ning of the Spring, shall have Souldiers ready upon the Borders of Artois and Henalt; and, on the other side, the States shall have ready 8000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, that the lying, as it were in the middle may be divided in his purposes, what to do in so doubt∣ful a case. Therefore the States will add to the two Auxiliary Re∣giments, which they sent at their own charge to aid the King, two Regiments more; but, if for all that, the Enemy should turn his whole strength upon them, that it shall be lawful for them to recall those Forces. And the French King, for his part, shall at his best conveniency, send as many Regiments to the Hollanders, as also 1000 Horse; That each shall have the chief Command in his own Country. What hath formerly been agreed, and is not by this present League renewed or altered, to be, and remain as they were: That the King have great Care and Honour to the Confederate Cities, and the Subjects within this League, and above all other, to the House of Nassau, for their everlastingly famous Merits towards the Commonwealth; That all Journeys, backward and forward, and all Trade, be free on both sides; That neither of them impose heavier Tributes upon the Subjects, of the other, than upon their own Citizens; That all the Laws which confiscate the Estates of Strangers, be cut off, and invalidate between them, and that the Right of Succession, and making Wills and Testaments be restored: That all Booty takn at Sea shall belong to them who first invaded or set the Enemy: That the Hollanders may sail whither they will even into the Western Kingdoms: That there be no demands nor distresses made for a publick debt upon privat per∣sons. That it shall not be lawful for any to retain any ships, either in their passage by, or coming to the Shore, to unlade, or to expose them to sale.
The publick Instruments of this League, were signed the last day of October, which were solemnly attested with pub∣lick Joy, wherein there was nothing omitted to make it com∣pleat. For besides that, it was for the settlement of peace. It also conduced much to the Honour and Majesty of the Com∣mon-wealth, much envyed for its new rising, that it was look∣ed upon by Kings in Honourable Leagues; which that it might be brought to passe, the French King had exceeded, while he esteems it convenient and agreeable to his own Af∣fairs, and the benefit of the Hollanders, even against them∣selves, although Queen Elizabeth had laboured, that these her old Allyes, should be comprehended under her Patronage: affirming, that it was enough, there being no cause, why Ci∣ties falling from a strange Government, should be inserted among Names of Princes of the highest Rank. There were some who would have repeated former seuds, how the Franks of old passed the River Wael, and seated themselves in that part of the Country, which is called Gel∣derland, that they possessed the Isle of Holland, from whence their Kings took the name of Meronee. That Governours were sent out of France into Holland; Then also that the English confess them of Frizon original by the idiom of their Tongue. Shortly after, their Princes were obliged to both the Kingdoms by Marriage; and that a great while before, when the Roman Power carryed all before it, the Hollanders were famous for Arms, fidelity and honest liberty, so that they were called the Emperours People, Brothers and Friends. When the Romans renounced all right and fair dealing, these choosing themselves a civil Leader, opposed them, making a confederacy both with Germany and France; O hers took notice of the vicissitude of their Affairs neerer hand, as particularly that, now the King of France had made a publick League against the Spaniard, with them, whose Deputies but a few years before for fear of the Spaniard, they durst hardly hearken to.
But the Regiments, which the Hollanders by the League, were bound to send, were not sent, but according to the King's desire, money instead thereof, which he rather want∣ed than men; But this the English took amiss, nor did the Queen vouchsafe to send any person to go to the German Princes, together with the Holland and French Embassadus, and certainly there was nothing proved a greater hindrance of others to joyn in that Allyance, then that Emulation; from hence the French conceived a deadly suspition, that the Eng∣lish desired to have a perpetual War with them: Nor with any other mind, was the Queen desired to forward the ma∣king a Peace between the Turk and the House of Austria: And not long after, there being a Conference appointed at Diope, to consider what course should be taken for carrying on the War the next year. There again the French were of∣fended at a Request made by the English, to wit, that if they could recover Calais, a Garrison might be put into it for the Queen. But they had rather the Spaniards should keep it, hoping that they might in the future, extort it from them, either by force, or by Article, which they much doubted, if once the English should get it. About the same time, it was desired of King Henry, That the Professors of several Arts which had been taught at Leyden, by ingenious persons bred there, might be allowed in France. The Prince of Aurange had formerly chosen this place for a Seat for the liberal Sciences, least for fear of charge, the People at a great distance, and being bred and born among Arms, should grow rude and barbarous; And by this means also, the City was repaired, and the ruines which it had suffered by a Siege amended; for being fa∣mous for fidelity and constancy, it rather chose this Reward of Learning, than to be free from Taxes, which was offered to it. The main motive hereto was Religion, the prop of their party, the gift of expounding whereof, had hitherto been assumed by Artificers, or of the unlearned and illiterate
common people; while the labour it self being without hope of preferment, and certainly attended by poverty, was the cause of penury, both in the teachers and learners. In a short time, although the Frizons also had to the like purpose or∣dained Franecre, this School of Holland, by the fame of the Instructors, and the flocking thither of much youth, both of their own and foreign Countries, got the preheminence: The Teacher of the study of the Civil Law, was Hugo Donnell, who following the steps of Connanus and Duarenus, compo∣sed the Discipline of the Laws, into an order and method of Art, taking away those things which the too secure ignorance of the former age had disordered, yet not so, as that it should give place to modern want of knowledg, which in empty dress of words, hath infringed the very sinues of that kind of Learning. But this man, by the infection of the Earl of Leicesters party, was carryed so far, that he forgot not onely his Studies, but even the duties of a private person, and a stranger, and from thence went away to Altorf: For inter∣preting the Manners and Customs of the Romans, and disco∣veries and dilucidations of Antiquity, was Justus Lipsius, who added both to his own fame, and the Honour of the place by his Learning, a person, who by the pleasing gravity of his behaviour, was honoured beyond his Profession, allu∣ring most men to delight in him, by the sweetness of his Dis∣course; for since Nature had denyed him neither Rhetorick nor Oratory, he rather chose that concise manner of speak∣ing, which is intermingled with mirth, which was in truth, a new mode of Speech, but yet in some sort resembling Anti∣quity; which when such did strive to imitate, as were not equall to him in wit and Judgement, they deviated into the most corrupt conceptions: But when publick fear, and pri∣vate injury had forced Lipsius to change his party, there was sent for out of France, Joseph the Son of Julius, who had con∣ferred to the Family of Scaliger, from which he was descen∣ded, not onely Nobility, but the vertue of paternal Wisdom,
by the laying open all things that were to be known, either concerning Nations or Ages, he was not wearied with con∣tinual study, even to his old Age, and might solace himself with this, that from his very Child-hood, his Fame and Re∣nown continually encreased. The Oriental Tongues were taught by Francis Raphelenge, and the Greek by Vulcanius, with no little Reputation; For disputation in Divinity, there was Franciscus Junius, a Man of a very sharp Wit, and one that would with great inginui∣ty, use the subtilty of the Adversaries Arguments against themselves. Here also was famous Hadrianus Julius, a Hollander, for his Learning in natural Philosophy and Medicine: nor was he contemptible for other parts of Wisdom. Hither also came that great light Aldegonde, there seeking leisure to translate the divine Law, into the Language of his Country. And that most famous Herbalist, Charles Clusius of Artois. Among the rest, we may reckon Janus Dowsa, who was ap∣pointed by the States, to oversee and govern the Students. (We may call him Chancellour of the University,) to whom Posterity will attribute great Honour, for his description of quality, the Honours born and enduring of the Siege of Leyden, in everlasting Poetry, yet in that kind, his Son, which bore the same name, excelled him; the same also being joyned with his Father, for composing the Annals of Holland, and 'tis probable, he would have been fit for greater Employ∣ments, if immature death had not taken him away, being a young man of highest expectation for Learning. With such Masters, and such examples as these, were Youth trained up, whose number in a short time so encreased, that Arts necessa∣ry both for publick and private Commodity, which before, by the unfrequentedness of the place were neglected, now were not sufficient for instructing Ingenuity. And although others of their own accord, do earnestly labour by literature and Poetry, to advance their name above the vulgar, Holland
having never been barren in that kind of Eloquence, wherein formerly excelled Peter Mannius, and Janus Secundi, and his Brothers; so now also, the like is found in the Wri∣tings of many young men. But yet the raw Studies of this Nation, which rather minds the getting of Wealth, were not come to their heighth, for yet had it not been the Country, either of Erasmus or Longolius. But the Reverence I bear to the Names of these great Men, and the Reputation of that more peaceable sort of Wisdom, hath made run far astray, both from the Common-wealth and the War. But now I return. There were Embassadors sent to Christian the Fourth, who now being come to his full and lawful Age, was of himself, without a Governour, King of Denmark, and had taken into his own hands, the full power of Government; and these were to congratulate him in the name of the States, with their Joy and well-wishes; but they were not to pre∣sent themselves, before the greatest of the Solemnities were past, least among so great an Assembly of Embassadors, there should arise any Contest for preheminence out of envy, or least they should voluntarily give place to all, to the diminu∣tion of their dignity. There wanted nothing, but that they for the common fear of the Spanish domineering, should have requested ayd. The Priviledges of Amsterdam onely, were confirmed; Those old ones claimed by the Cities of Schidam, and En∣chuysen, from former Kings, were disannuled, yet the Em∣bssadors were dismissed with Honour and Gifts, and so not long after, John Baptista Taxis, coming to him from the Spaniard, although he brought far richer Gifts, yet was not received with the like kindness. The Reason hereof, was be∣lieved to be this, because the Spaniard, who not long before had promised three hundred thousand Duckets yearly to the Dane, instead of a Tribute, that he would not suffer the Hol∣landers to come into these Streights, having not performed
this, was afterwards convicted, that he would by treachery have invaded his Castles upon the Sound, whereof notice had been sent him by the Ʋnited States. After the taking of Hulst, all things about the Hollanders were quiet, excepting onely some light and memorable Skir∣mishes between the Horse. For as well theirs, as the Ene∣mies Militia, was so exhausted, that they could hardly de∣fend the Borders of the Netherlands against the French; And at the beginning of Autumn, fulfilling his promises with an easie hope, and the great favour of his Allyes, sent against the Artoysians, the Marshall, Biron, Commander of a consi∣derable Body of Horse, seeming as if he went to defend Picardy. Verembonius, earnestly desiring to free the Government, committed to him from rapine, marched with twelve Troops of Horse against the French, being then not so many in num∣ber, yet nevertheless, he was overcome and taken Prisoner, together with Count Montecuculi, an Italian, and several o∣thers, upon whom was imposed a great Sum of money for their Ransom: And presently, the Conquerours falling not onely into Artois, but Flanders, so pillaged the whole Coun∣try, that they made a greater wast and havock there, than had ever been remembred to be made in France in the Wars, ei∣ther of Charles formerly, or Philip lately. The Country people and Boors, flying into the Cities, carryed thither not onely Poverty, but Infectious Diseases. Whereupon the Lord of Cimace was presently sent with a new strength to defend the Borders; but he also was put to flight, Ambrosio Landria∣no, the General of the Horse, undervaluing his Command, who being afterwards taken by that Name, besides the igno∣miny, was glad to redeem himself with a great Sum of Mo∣ney. Thus were the French wholly become Masters of the Field, and being Conquerors in all the Fights of Horse, with long Marches tired out the Foot.
The Winter now approaching, the King of France, as if he intended somewhat against Henalt, requir'd the States, That they would disturb the Enemies quiet in another part. They ful∣filling the Request, without any other Reason, though to their great disadvantage, put some Souldiers aboard Ships at Berghen, until they were informed, that the King's Endeavors were hindted, by the increase and overflowings of the Ri∣vers, and that all the French Forces, for fear of the Cold, were marched quite out of the Netherlands. Another great and insolent Mischief attended the Arch-Duke's Poverty; for the Germans, though they were sworn to him, because they were not paid their Wages, seized He∣rentals, against whom some Spaniards being sent, to revenge the imitation of their own Customs, and strongly repulsed, infinitely increased the Sedition. And, in Walcheren, one John Wrmys a Scot, was put to Death, for that he sollicited others, to deliver up to the Spaniard, Vere, a Town in that Island; yet affirming, he was mov'd thereto by the Jesuits. About this time, Messengers were sent to the King of Spain, day after day, That he labour, by all means, to raise what Money he could, that the Fleet might be expedited; and, to the same purpose, that he would lay a Restriction upon all Forreign Ships whatsoever; and besides, that they make diligent search for all Hollanders, and bring them to punishment. This being heard, it pleased the States to make a Decree, for that there was not caution enough used against danger, that no one should dare to carry Corn into Spain, and there was the greater Reason, for this being a dangerous year, both Poland and Prussia retaining their Harvests, by the like means, by shunning Famine at home, they sent it to their Enemy; and notwithstanding, Amsterdam resisted this Decree, whose principal gain consisted in that Transportation, yet by the consent of the rest of the Cities it was confirmed. And lest domestick offences should make any of them become a prey to the French or English, they set some Ships of War upon
the Sea running by their Coasts, which when to search all Ships when they went out. In the Month of November, the Spanish Fleet, as if impa∣tient through fury, to defer the revenge of the injury done to them at Cadiz, until the Summer, set out, consisting of one hundred Sayl of Ships, wherein were fourteen thousand Soul∣diers, under the Command of Martin Padilla, report giving out, that they intended for Cornwall, where Britain stretcheth out her Land to the Southward, between France and Ireland; And it was added further, that the King of Spain would give England as a Dowry to his Daughter, having first purged it from Heresie in Religion, and this was given out, least the fear of Foreign Empire should avert their affections. But the same God who had often before prevented them in the like endeavours, now again shewed his power; for in one night, forty of their Ships were cast away upon the Sands and Shallowes, with the loss of five thousand men, and a great Sum of Money. The greatest harm to the Spaniard, was his own diffidence; for the German and Netherlandish Officers, which they had taken into the Fleet, admonishing them to go another way, they compelled with drawn Swords, to follow the ill presa∣ging Signs of them going before: At length among the hindermost of the Ships, a certain Seaman of Holland, was believed, who eight years before, having great Rewards for preserving many of the Spaniards, by so much the more faithfully he now again performed the like Office. They that survived this mischief (which hapned about the Promontory called Artabram) returned home. But the Dunkerkers in the Netherlands, being commanded to expect this Fleet in the mean while rested quiet. Thus without damage done to any of the Sea-Coasts, this yea was ended with the Hollanders, but on the contrary, they burned two Ships which were built at Newport.
Moreover, this restless People sailed to the places of the Spanish Negotiation, being Islands beyond the Equinoctial Circle, being most fruitful of Salt, without any labour of man; They went also to Guiny for Gold, Ivory, Pepper, and Brasile-Wood, and St. Thomas Island for Sugar, and all this for gain sake, contrary to the Kings Edict, feigning them∣selves to be Portugueses; But most wonderful, and where to the Antients have not delivered any like matter, nor are there any Testimonies of this more experienced Age like to that; which the Hollanders undertook, and performed the latter end of this year, and the beginning of the next, when now the third time they went into the North, all whose Secrets they throughly searched. They remembred, that the search after great things is long and difficult, that all the corners of the new World were not found out at once, that the Portu∣gueses had made long stayes upon the edges and skirts of A∣merica. And they who were skilful in Nature, pointed out a surer way through the open Ocean, whose reciprocal ebbing and flowing, keeping by motion, the Waves thereof free, defends them also against the violence of the cold. Two Ships leaving the Islands of Orckney and Norway, putting out far to Sea, from thence steered divers courses, both towards the North, but the one inclining more to the East, the other to the West. There lies in that Sea, a Land full of grass, which is wonderful in that Scituation, and most pleasantly green, where the Pole is elevated eighty degrees (though the Antients counted it distant from the Equator, above ninety.) But whether it was encompassed by the Sea, or hath further behind it a larger Continent, was not then tryed. Some of the Seamen thought it to be the Isle of Groenland, famous of old for the Commerce from Venice, Norway, and the Low-Countries: now the name thereof is onely mentioned, the Dane claiming it as a part of his Do∣minions, but to little purpose, since he cannot find it.
This proceeded from the sloath of such, as denyed things formerly known, both in Writings of Antiquity, and even in the memories of some alive. Whereas we follow Nature to the most remote distances, as knowing what God hath discovered to us by nearer Journies. But afterwards, a more diligent search being made by Island, we found that Groen∣land was something more distant from the North: In this Land, which we found, having no Inhabitants, the first dis∣coverer, thereof, had placed Monuments made of thick square Timber and Stones, whereon was written the name of Spits∣berg, from the sharp pointed Mountain tops, so called-as was believed; in which very place, as appears both by Fame and Records, that in after-times, the fruitfulness of its many bayes, for the catching of Whales, hath been no small occa∣sion of discord between the English and the Hollanders. There also are found Birds, not unknown in ou Cly∣mates, (it is a kind of Goose) which the ignorance of for∣mer times believed, to be bred in Scotland upon Trees, whence falling ino he Water they took life: Then bending their course a little towards the South, their Ship endeavour∣ing to steer to the Westward, was by Tempests driven back to the Coast of Russia. A little lower is another Island, besides those found by them passing which as alo that which bears the Discoverers name, to wit, Willoughby, they came to Zmbla, where the Pole is elevated seventy and six degrees; where while the Seamen reviewed the known place of the Coast, and the ap∣pearances of their former Voyage, hindered first by Winds, then by Ice, so that they could not passe that Sea. At length, among many delayes, and great dangers, both of the Men and Ships, they scarce reached the Aurange Islands, for now they were set fast, as in a consolidated Body of continuall Ice, and anon, the same breaking, and returning upon them, made all things full of danger: which were really true, yet
yet no less wondrous,  Greeks, proceeding a little so  passage was quite  by  well into the Scythian Sea, a into the Straigh Nassaus at last, being reduced to the ultimate hope, , by the same way they came, the Ship was quite frozen up, not far from the Shore; whereby it came to passe, that af∣terwards, when the rest of the Sea was thawed, yet the Ice still kept the Ship fast. Nor did there any thing eain, but that wintering in Zembla, they should wait for a better sea∣son: Wherefore taking out of their Ship, Boards and Planks, they built for themselves and then sffe a poor  And by chance, the Tyde had thrown upon the same Coast, a great quantity of Tber, but uncertain from whence it should come, which in this their desolate Condition, was a great help for perfecting their House, and yielded withall, good Provisions for Fewel: during their above here, they had continual and daily sights with Beats, which some∣times were driven away by making great out-cryes; but otherwhiles, being more hungry, and so more furious, they were fain to make use of shot, as well to affright them, as defend themselves; Their flesh they found to be unwhol∣som for food, not without some harm (for in this place, the Maritime wild Beasts are the only Food to the wild Beasts of the Land) the fa they made use of to make them lights to burn in the night. These miserable poor Creatures, were at last after all other humane benefits, lest by the  Coun∣try, and among none but wild Beasts▪ And here it is to be remembred, that a certain  the Sun  and doth not arise again of a long time, as we have elsewhere re∣membred; And now their fear and horrour encreased with darkness, and the cruel untemperateness of the Ayr.
The vast accumulated Mountains of Snow, with much pain and difficulty, they very hardly removed, for fear least it should overwhelm their Habitation, and were fain to make the same into steps, and such was the bitter sharpness of the Ayr, all about, that if at any time they went forth, they were so benummed in their joynts, that they could scarcely bring them to be again warm, until they scorched them into bli∣sters: nay, even within doors, such so penetrating, and fierce was the cold, that both the mens Apparel, the Walls, yea, and the very fire it self was so deaded, that they might as soon be burned as warmed. And now while they endeavou∣red to keep out the cold, by shutting their doors; the vapor of the Coals had like to have suffocated them all. They found it the greatest help to them, to imitate their own Country Stoves, or else to warm their beds with exceeding hot Iron or Stones. Now did Foxes occupy the empty places left by the Bears (for the Bear is a Creature, whose sight being more dull, and therefore afraid of the darkness, had hidden them∣selves in Caves. These Foxes being taken by Traps, served them both for Victuals and Rayment. Long had their better hope to see once again, the light spun out of their over-worn patience, when as it were by divine mercy and providence, the Sun be∣gan to spread his splendiferous tayes, sooner than the ordi∣nary course of the Heavens directed; For the night was three months shorter, then that part of the World, being un∣der seventy degrees usually is acquainted with, unless it may be, they erred either in the Scituation of the place, or in the reckoning and measure of that disconsolate darkness, which their Diary or Journal will scarce allow to be be∣lieved; or else, while the Sun was passing not far off under the Earth, some thick Clouds received its opposite light, and there dispersed the same by repercussion, or some yet undis∣covered
parts of the Earth might cause the wonder: how∣ever it was, 'tis sure, they begun then first to creep abroad, and habituate their weakened Bodies to labour, which they were very earnest at, though to them at that time, both grie∣vous and painful; For the Sea now growing open towards the very North it self, not towards Scythia, called them away. By which Argument, many have been induced to believe, that the Ice was brought down cut of the River of Scythia, and that the violence of the cold is encreased, by the vicinity of the shores, rather than of the Pole; for the heat doth not presently abate as much as you back from the Equi∣noctial: wherefore they were forced to take their Journey in this open Sea, under the very North Star, if any for the future durst make an attempt there after them. Another con∣firmation of this Opinion was, that the Island which we men∣tioned formerly to be green, lay below Zembla in regard Zem∣bla it self, nourisheth nothing green, and therefore in all that Land, there is no Creature bred, which useth such Pasture. But now the Marriners in vain, delayed the egress of their Ship, yet detained by the Ice, and by this procrastination, the Victuals which hitherto they had moderately distributed every day man by man, began to fail, and their drink being corrupted, and spoyled by the Frost, compelled them to melt Snow to asswage their thirst, and if they should stay any lon∣ger, Winter would again return, and together with it, cer∣tain mine: hereupon, they speeded forwards, their Ship∣boats, and although most of them were sick, (for poverty, and the many great miseries they had undergone, had even worn out all their strength:) yet necessity, which is stronger then any Disease, so did encourage them, that they hewed the Ice rising into great Hills, untill they had made it level, and then drawing their little Vessels that way, at length they got a float, yet had they not then an end of their Labours; for
being often stopped with Ice, and scarcely escaping away by the help both of their Oars, Sails and hands, they were compelled to go thence to the next Coast, for meer hunge; and there they found Eggs and Birds, easie to be taken, for that they knew not the guite of humane Rapine, and cove∣tousness; and also it was found, all along the subsequent places, that we are shunned by other Animals, not that they want gentleness, but onely we. In the interim, they among them that were sick, being exposed to the Rain, and the in∣juries of the piercing Ayr, dying, were a great cause of grief to their Companions, if not of envy, when they looked back upon their own condition, trembling to think what end, Fortune, or rather Providence would allot them. Among those that dyed, was William Barent, the Master of the unfortunate Ship, who was no less worthy to be remem∣bred in the Catalogue of famous men, then was Vesputius and Columbus though in dispight of Fortune. Those few that survived, sometimes drew the Boats over the Ice, other whiles repaired their decayes. Thus while their Labour increased, and their strength de∣cay'd, an auspicious Wind brought them, even now fainting, and able to work no more, to the utmost Skirts of Zembla, opposite to our Ocean. Here, after a whole year, they first saw some Russian Sea-men, and, by hap they were the same, which they found nig the Streight in their second Naviga∣tion. They therefore, as indeed the whole Nation is very Religious, comforted and pitied them both by Countenance and Speech, as much as could be understood thereby, be∣holding them to be the Reliques of a Fleet, so late before ter∣rible; and besides, they voluntarily supplyed them with Pro∣visions. Here they found a very wholesom Herb, for weak∣ned and strained Members; which very Disease, had and did vehemently afflict the Sea-men at that present, caused by
the violence of the former and present Cold: Thus equal and tender is Nature, that provides fit Remedies for all Di∣stempers and Climates. This Herb was supposed to be the Britannica, or Spoonwart of Plimy, which a most diligent Wri∣ter commemorates, that the Romans used against the same Disease, by the reaching of the Frizons. After this, being long retained by a cross Wind, in the Entrance of the Russian Sea; and as oft as they were pinched with any Extremity of Hunger, by chance, by the last meeting of some Ships belong∣ing to the Laplanders, living on that Coast, whose Hospitality refreshing them, when the Darkness had separated their Boats, they arrived at the Isle of Quilodun. There they under∣stand (so doh Chance otentimes restore the most desperate Affairs) that there was in the Neighbouring Port a Ship, which had come with them out of Holland, and wa thown by Tempest upon that Shore, to furnish and promote their Return into their own Country. They were Twelve, the chief of them being Jacob Hemskerk, who, after so many perils, and so much labour, returned even miraculously to Amsterdam, from the furthest and most desolate part of the World. The Sixth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1597.THE Winter was not above half past, when a Fortunate Chance gave the Hollanders a notable good Omen of Success in the beginning Year, and shewed a
Return of that good Fortune, which had, since the Honour atchieved at Groening, been at a stay. For the Arch-Duke Albertus, having freed the Borders of Artois from fear of the French, had put his Souldiers into Garrisons; yet leaving the greatest part thereof in Brabant, wherein there were four Regiments of old Souldiers, and some fresh men, for Sup∣plies: so as they were above four Thousand Foot, and five Troops, containing five hundred Horse, which all quarrer'd in and about Turnhoult. This is a considerable Village of Brabant, having round about it open Fields, formerly much delighted in by the Princes, when Hunting, and innocent Re∣creations, diverted their more serious Thoughts: Then it was chosen for concealing of Counsels, because the place being of equal distance to many places, yields no shew of a Jour∣ney. This, in regard of its incertainty, made the Hollanders more fearful, while he was suspected in the next Towns of Brabant, and the Isles of Zeland, especially by reason of the Ice, whereby the Rivers, which are the strongest Defence of those parts, being Frozen, shewed them an easie Passage to go whither they listed. And the Conjecture was not much dissonant from their Actions, which supposed them to be there quarter'd, that they might, in stead of Pay, waste and plunder the Fertile Country adjoyning. The Governours of the Neighbouring Garrisons, advised the Prince, upon occasi∣on of the Enemies Foraging; that, before their Forces were too much multiplyed there, cutting off that Body, which was the chief strength of the Enemy, all fear for the future would be utterly taken away: And that which gave the greatest Encouragement to their Hopes of Success, was the Com∣mander of the Forces there, which was Count de Warras, Varembonius his Brother, a man altogether ignorant in Mar∣tial Affairs, neither did he command with any certain Fore∣sight, nor was much beloved of his men. But, on the contrary,
they were afraid, that to gather the Souldiers and Guns into a Body, lying dispersedly scatter'd in Towns at a great di∣stance, the troublesomness of the Journey in the depth of Winter, when though it did freez, yet the Ground was not thereby hardned, perhaps the Enemy might hear thereof, and then all their Consultations had been to no purpose: How∣ever, Hope banish'd Fear; and removing Difficulties as much as was possible, by secret Commands to the Captains, and preparation of all other Things necessary, the Enterprize was speeded as much as might be: Fortune also favour'd the Design by a moderate Thaw and fair Weather. The place, where all the States Forces were to meet, was Gertruydenberg, distant thence not above six hours Journey; and because the greatest part of the Horse lying all about, it was convenient for their Conveyance and Transportation over the Maes. The appointed day of Meeting was disap∣pointed; yet the Prince, the next day, leads out five Thou∣sand Foot, and eight hundred Horse; with which, at the be∣ginning of the Night he came to Raveil, with two Pieces of Cannon for Battery, and as many Field-pieces, ready in the duskishness of the Light, as Opportunity had or should pre∣sent it self; either to assault the slight Works of the Enemy, or to dare him to fight in the open Field; for, from hence, they were within an hours march of the Enemy, who being startled by some Scouts that went before, or else, it may be, seeing the Fires, wherewith the Hollanders refreshed their Bodies, were of divers Opinions, not well knowing what to think: part of them advised to stay for the Enemy within their Fortifications: Others counselled, with more Reason, forthwith to fall upon them, being weary with their March, and wet with Dirt; and that so great Honour should not be given to Prince Maurice, whereby it should be said, that an Army of old Souldiers, which had undergone the Brunt and Heat of the War, had declined to give Battel, to much more greater Forces than he had: But the greater Number pre∣tended
very usibly to conceal their Fear, that it was better to arenff with their Forces intie, to Herentals, which was not f off and would be a place of safety for them; for no mn ough to be prodigal, either of his Valour, or Fortunes: Wherewith, and with Fear, Count Warras being amazed, agreeing, That same last Counsels though both more disho∣nourable and dangerous, prevail'd: But it was too late, since the Enemy was so near; and although all things that might be Impediments to them, were sent away before at the latter end of the Night; and as soon as it was day, they had with a selected party made shew rather of a March, than a Flight; yet they could not avoid, but they would appear most valiant who follow'd. Now was Silence commanded, and no Noise heard either of Drum or Trumpet, things probably in them∣selves vain; but in Military Minds they prevailed much, either to incourage or dishearten. Of which, the Prince ha∣ving Intelligence, he then no longer consulted of the Event of the Battel, but all his care was, that the Enemy might not escape ; and this the rather, because he fore-saw, that the Mooishness of the Fields, and he Interposition of the River, would delay him in his March, he hasted early in the Morning with some Troops, and the most Nimble Men pick∣ed out of the Regiments, to the Number of Two Hundred, into the Field, commanding the Foot to follow a far off at a distance with the Cannon. There was reen the Count Ho∣henlo, then prepared for a Journey into Germany; and although the Prince hd omitted to call him, yet he conjecturing the Reasons of this Preparation, prefer'd the occasion of the good Management of that Affair, before his own private Bu∣siness: And Eberhard Count Solms, minding to wipe away the stain of his last years Dispute by new Merit. There were also of English Sir Francis Vere, and Sir Robert Sydney, Go∣vernour of Flushing: And, of Netherlanders, Marcellus Baxius, a Captain of a most valiant Troop of Horse, and one of the chief Counsellors of this Expedition, besides many
others. Sir Francis Vere was sent with some light Foot to scoure the Woods and Hedges, that no Ambushes might sur∣prize them, and coming to the River running by the Fields, whose long and narrow Streights & Fords were very trouble∣some to passe, and there was but one Woodden little Bridge, which was onely broad enough for one at once to go over a brest, he drove away the Enemy by the force of his Shot, which had been left at that place, on purpose to hinder the pursuit. Thence having overtaken a good Body of the Enemies, he fell upon their Rear: they being not far from a narrow Lane, which being wooddy on both sides, led to Herentals: which if the Enemy had reached (and the Carriages were already entred) there could have been no place to fight. In the in∣terim, Count Hohenlo, to whom the Prince had given four hundred Horse to assist the Foot, fell in upon the Enemies Flank: But they could not yet come to close fight, by reason of a Moorish Valley, that lay between, which yet was not so plain or large, that a moderate Army could be drawn up therein. The Regiments under the Command of the Count de Warras, marched at a just distance in their nine and eleven Foot order. The first was a Regiment of Germanes, Com∣manded by Count Sulyo. The second of Walloons, being old Souldiers formerly of Lamt and Coquelle, but now led by Aschicurtio. Barlot had the charge of another Regiment of the same Nation, and the Neapolitans brought up the Rear; which belonged to the Marquess of Trevigiana, then absent in Italy. On the left hand, they were secured by continual Woods and a River that runs down to Turnhoult. The Horse in three Bodies, sometimes defended the Front, other times the Right Flank, Commanded by Bstu, and under him Drake, Grobendon▪ Gusman and others. The place and Word being given for the Onter Hohenlo charging through the rest of the Enemies Forces, uell on upon them: At which time, the Horse appointed to defend the Flank, returning
disorderly, put their Foot into confusion. Thus the Germans were easily routed: Nor were the Italians able to abide the shake of Sir Francis Vere, who was sent to fall on their Rear, with part of the Horse, which till then, had remained with the Prince. These being thus put to flight, the middle Regiments, with rare celerity, were soiled: in so much, that the Conque∣rours marvailed to see the old Souldiers so easily quit the place. But besides this, the flying Horse had caused a gene∣rall terrour, and the Regiments themselves were not advan∣tagiously ordered; for the great Bodies of Pikes, made up out of all the Bands, did not defend the rest, but stood here and there, thin and dispersedly, so that the Nassavians might with ease break in among them, and that the more safely, be∣cause the Musketiers had discharged their shot, not by turns, and one after another, but in a manner, all at once. And Basta afterwards accused, that he had not rather maintained the Rear of the Foot, shewed Count Warras his Orders to him. Of the Nassavian Assaylants, four onely were killed, and six hurt, this day yielding a Noble docu∣ment of new fighting. For Prince Maurice had not armed his Horsemen with Lance, according to general Customs, but with Carabines (for so is that sort of Gun called.) Therefore the Darts which were first thrown, being avoided, before the Spearmen could get time and place, for use of their Spears, they were so suddainly and furiously wounded, that they were neither able to weild their Arms, or keep themselves in any order. And when they were thus routed, and brought into confusion, they had no room to fly away, because the Woods and Waters which were a defence to them fight∣ing, were turned to their great hindrance and prejudice, as they fled; so that the Victors by their too much confidence, were like to have fallen into danger; for while some of them continued the slaughter, and others were fallen upon their Prey; Basta accompanied with a few of his men, under∣standing
that all the narrow Streights and Passages of the wayes, were stopped, he feigned boldness out of necessity, he turns his Bridle, and runs back upon the Enemy. This unexpected and sudden chance, made many of the Nassavians, who were wholly minding the spoyl, and search∣ing the Waggons, to turn their backs and fly (for that kind of People are for the most part full of fear.) But the chief Commanders of the Horse, part of which had followed be∣hind in a great and slow moving Body, by Fortune, then came in to stop those that fled, and encourage those that were afraid, threatning withall, that unless they turned head upon their Enemies, themselves would become their Exe∣cutioners: And with this fear, some Prisoners, who stood about the Prince begging for their lives, doubting a change of Fortune, were run through with Swords, and killed; But the Prince, careful to prevent the like for the future, had newly appointed as a safeguard to themselves and the Victo∣ry, four Troops then before exempted from danger: yet the Captain of one Troop being commanded to lead up his, ta∣king the Command in evill part, had intermingled them all in the Fight, being indeed of themselves, more ready for pillage then obedience; yet flocking at last to their Com∣mander in Chief, they especially, who were moved either with the sense, or reverence of Duty or Reputation, they es∣caped the danger; and the Enemies once more put to flight, were equally afflicted with their own slaughters, and the nar∣rowness of the wayes: having all this while, scarce sullyed the Victory with the loss of ten of the Conquerours: The Foot came in onely to part of the Soyl. After this Fight, here were buried above two thousand of the Enemies; there were five hundred taken Prisoners, and a great number of Ensigns: some dyed of their wounds. Next day the Castle of Turnhoult well encompassed with Trenches was surrendred. The Foot being returned into Garrisons, and the Horse Commanded forthwith to depart, least the Enemy
should rally any of his Forces, and in the night set upon them wearied with the pursuit. Thence the Prince Maurice try∣umphing among the joyful gratulations of the People, he hanged up in the Counsel-House at the Hagne, eight and thirty Foot-Colours taken from the Enemy, and one Cornet of Horse, which had been Drakes: Nor was the Reputation of the Victory any thing lessened by this, that Count Warras himself, being at the very first, struck down to the ground, his breathless Corps was sent together with Letters to Al∣bertus, who returned great thanks for the same, and when of late, a Horseman or Trooper belonging to the Prince, being hanged by the Enemy▪ had been vindicated by the like pun∣ishment of a Spaniard, the Arch-Duke for the future, pro∣mised faithfully, to observe the Laws of Arms, himself being naturally a great stranger to all cruelty. This was the first Experiment Prince Maurice, who had now for ten years been General, received of him by Letters. Nor did there grow a Confidence in the Souldier onely, against the Enemy, from the Event; but likewise it made him more cautious of what might happen, in regard he had seen that the Discipline of the Army, was not sufficiently supported against sudden accidents, and the War proved du∣bious, upon any slight turning of mens minds, and that there was so much danger, even in the obtaining of Victory. But Albertus, being at once oppressed with the want of Money, and so great a slaughter of his men, fell to Consulta∣tion night and day, but yet was hardly able to procure a re∣medy to either of these mischiefs. He was exhausted also before, not by payment of debts, but giving of Gratuities, so that at the one Siege of Hulst, he gave away more in Rewards, then the Duke of Parma spent in three years, by which means, from that time, there had been a failer of payment of the Souldiers Wages: Thus he who before by extraordinary Gifts, had allured many to come over from their own party to him, was now very much
weakened by the desertions of his own men. The Germans being a People very greedy for money, of who he had Commanded to be levyed both Horse and Fo either de∣nyed him their help, or else as soon as they  away again; Divers Cities, and fist of ll Ipre for fear of Sedition, refused Garrisons; And h as much s he coul endeavour∣ing to meet and stop ou wn, had put to pge, and pawn∣ed most of his own Houshold-stuff, and desired the Cities, that they would lend him some Montes, which they of Bruxells took the boldness to deny. And he would also have Covenanted with them of Fucke, but the uncertainty of their credit, and the example of the late Spanish Edict terri∣fied them: the remaining  of Winter, and the begin∣ning of the Spring, were passed over between Satagems, and sudden actions, while there was no Army abroad, while small parties undertake great attempts. Ferdinando Tellius Portocarrera, Govened Dorlens for the Spaniard, from which Town, Amiens was not far distan, the Metropolis of Picardy, and reckoned among the greatest Ci∣ties of France, very rich, and well Scituate, as well for War, as Provisions and Trade, and watered by the old River Samar. This City was subject to Henry King of France, but turn∣ing out their Garrison, and committing the Custody of the City to the Magistrates, under the pretence of Priviledges, they usurped more carelsly, the righ of liberty, hae by their Princes, and dangerous as to the Enemy. Whereof, Ferdinando receiving Intelligence, by the Advice of some Exiles, but especially of a certain Monk, after he had by Spyes and Scouts, learned the Scituation of places, received Souldiers from Albertus, for perfecting the Design. First of all, eighteen nimble and ingenious men as soon as ever the entrance into the City was open, were in the twilight sent in, and after them others, in the habits of Boors, carrying Apples; and part of them drove a Cart loaden with Hay,
by which the Percullises, the stayes that held them up, being cut, as is usual in time of danger, might be supported a∣gainst a fall. The Keepers of the Passage were easily killed, either with the Weapons that were hid before, or those that were gotten by the first slaughter; and by the speedy run∣ning in of those, who lay hid in certain places near the City, a way was made for the following Companies; By chance, in that very Punctillio of time, (for it was Lent) a certain man in a Sermon to the People, laying before them their sins, and altogether ignorant of the design, said, they were worthy to fall into the power of the Spaniards, and so they did. For although the City was both strong and populous, in∣habited by no less then fourteen thousand men, yet did it not long resist, whether from the ambiguity of their Allegiance to the King, or being grown voyd of Valour, from their for∣mer security, or wanting of Government, is uncertain; but this is sure, that the Count St. Paul, the Governour of the Place, hearing the Tumult, fled out of the Town another way: Things thus secured, the Garrison was augmented, all things that adjoyned to the City burned, the Citizens disarmed and spoiled, yielded a great booty, as well to the Souldiery as the Commanders, especially the Arch-Duke, because the King a little before had sent in thither a great number of Artillery, and all other Furniture for War. Albertus sent a Messenger to King Philip, with the news of this good success, affirming, that it was one, and that the chiefest of the Cities Scituate on the River Samar, and for∣merly possessed by the Dukes of Burgundy, untill the French extorted them from their Heyr, a fatherless Virgin; and therefore now, what was gotten by War, he should endea∣vour still to retain, if at any time thereafter, a Peace should happen to be concluded. This produced a great damage to the French, but not with∣out some benefit: For the Citizens of Amiens, being used hardly by the Spaniard, made even those in France that were
of the Catholick Religion, more obedient to the King, and not to refuse Garisons as before they did. The King himself, the thoughts of Peace being shaken off, spent all his time with his Allyes, so that now he seemed ready to accept the same Conditions, which the English had offered before con∣cerning Calais. In the mean time, the Fortune of one day, made the French a long work to recover what was lost; whereupon, the Horse being Quartered all about the Coun∣try, from thence Biron encreased his Forces by all means to besiege Amiens, untill the King himself came before it, and being allured to try his turn, he unfortunately attempted Artois, by blowing up the Walls with Gun-powder, and Sca∣ling-Ladders: Nor had the French any better success, ei∣ther at Cambray or Dorlens: And the Spaniards likewise lost their design upon Gravewaert, an Island within the division of the Rhine, and also upon Steenwie, against which there were a thousand Foot out of the Garrisons, & twenty and four hun∣dred Horse gathered together by several marches. These in the dead of the night, having cut down the Palisadoes that stood in the way, endeavoured to come up to the Rampire. And as they had much forwarded their first attempts by si∣lence, so that the terrour might by reason of the darkness, be greater, they assaulted divers parts of the Walls, with a hide∣ous Outcry and Singing; but the Sentinels not troubled with bare noyses, exposed themselves to the danger, and that advertised others that stood not far off; (for most of them were in small covered Huts near the Rampire:) part of whom without their Cloaths, as they leaped out of their Beds, threw down Stones upon the Assaylants heads, as they climbed up the Walls; Others half Armed, killed the Ene∣mies retiring from the Rampire, or else by their shot, driving away such as came on afresh, and pursuing them when they fled. Thus the Assaylants, though divers times gathering fresh Courage, yet at length were beaten off, striving to hide the
greatness of their slaughter, by carrying away the dead Bo∣dies privately: About the same time, as it Fortune intended to bear her self equally towards all, Prince Maurice con∣ducting some Foot, and a few Troops of Horse to Ni∣ghen, without any halt upon their march, with a well-layd design upon solid Counsel to take Venloo, was met by ill suc∣cess, though he had before sent some Souldiers up the River, aboard two Ships: out of the first, the Souldiers coming a∣shore, had now taken the Gate, and killed such as guarded the same, helped also by the foreknowledge of some in the City. But the other Ship, laden with an hundred Souldiers, was hindred by the slacking of the wind, and a Ford or Shallow in the River, in which time, the day-light fully ap∣pearing, the Townsmen assembled, and with great labour stopped at first the inner Gate; then their number encreas∣ing, they drove away those that kept the Skirts of the Town, being not above fifty men. And as they sled, they were wounded by the Seamen from Leige. In this third Experiment of his Valour, was slain Matthias Holly, yet no less worthy of Honour there then at Breda and Nordam. With him also fell Schalque the Captain of the Ship. Others were taken and punished, that the right of War might as it were by consent, prevail in averting such kinds of dangers. One who had delivered, or rather betray∣ed the Gate by a Politick confidence running about the City, affrighted as it were with the common terrour, and not being known, escaped away on the contrary side of the Town. Moreover, some Souldiers being sent with a Fleet to the Coast of Flanders, returned, having effected nothing. In this mean while, the Count of Bulloyn, with a small par∣ty, wasting and plundering Henault, and the Country about the Maes, never rested long in one place; and Prince Mau∣rice's Horse, being by their late Victory grown more confi∣dent, going out of their Garrisons in Brabant and Gelderland, were both of them, though in several places, surprised by the
Enemy and slain. Then was the Summer spent among the Hollanders, in trivial actions and attempts, and by the Arch∣duke, in taking care to retain and keep Amiens; and be∣cause the Ʋnited Provinces, while they had leisure, neg∣lected all occasions of the War, having enough to do, to send ayd to their Allyes, and not themselves also to be wearied out. At this time, some discords begun to grow among them, although not sufficient to make a breach of the League, yet the more suspected, because they fell out at that time. The City of Groeninge, and they that inhabited the open Country, between the Rivers Emes, and Lecke, breathing out inveterate and cankered hate one against the other, were not easily united or reconciled, while the City obstinately urgeth those things, which the Duke of Parma had granted to it, when it followed the Kings Party, not by a setled and perpetual Law, but in the manner of an Interloquatory Edict. On the contrary, the Boors brake the antient League with it, and refuse all Society, as if the City had endeavoured a diminution of their liberty, whereas they would manage their own business separately; It was true, that as formerly all the People of Germany, so likewise the Frizons, had distinct Dominions, that no Consultations should be held, but by their Consent; But the Country beyond Lecke, and such as were distinguished into Dorpes, had agreed by Article, to joyn their Forces with those of the City, which was their Neighbour, as well against foreign, as domestick evills; to whom likewise flourishing in Merchandise, and Reverenced for Sanctimony of Judgment, they had given great Authority in the ordering both, and all the Neighbouring People wil∣lingly offered them thereby, the Reward of their Allyance, being accustomed there to proclaim all their Solemn Con∣ventions: But that which at the beginning was free, by long use, and many Covenants, had now passed into the force of Law and Right; yet this was not the time, that all Bonds,
however strictly tyed, should be loosed; 'Tis true, the Spa∣niard looked upon it, as a main part of his Potency, to nou∣rish the divisions of his Subjects, by giving no definitive Sentence between them; But the Strength of the United States was augmented by Concord, and therefore they ap∣pointed Judges for the deciding these Controversies: At first, three, and when the Country-People were offended at their Judgment, nine others were added, whose Decree was allowed and confirmed in the Counsel of the General States. To this purpose, the Deputies as well for the City, as the Country, are Commanded to make one Body Politick out of both, to Govern as one Common-wealth, and all matters of the greatest Concernment, were to be debated in that As∣sembly; but things of meaner quality, to be discussed by the Deputies. To their care was committed, all the common Tributes and Taxes, and whatsoever had belonged, either to the Prince or Priesthood, that in all equal suffages, although the City should have Priority, yet it should not have any Superiority; yet it was provided, that they who governed the Affairs of the Country, (they were called Hovet-men) according to Custom, should be chosen by the City Senate, which the House of Austria had preserved entire in Gelder∣land, the rest of the same Court by the States: As to Mer∣chandising, it was thus moderated, That whatever was of the Growth of the Country, or Manufacted there, should not be exported, till it had been first brought to Groeningen Market, neither might they use any other Drink, then what was brewed there in Groening: (this Ale there made, is of Water boyled with Barley, the common Drink of Ger∣many) and the familiar use there, made this the more easily accepted by both; but for foreign Merchandises, free li∣berty was allowed. Many other things there, were of like nature composed, which although at first moved with high Contests, yet com∣ing
short of the intent aymed at, it irked to perform. But now the contention of the Hollanders, with those of Zeland, was so much the more grievous, by how much the Unity of the entire Body was maintained by the Wealth of these: The difference was about Customs, which were raised by Transportation of Commodities, either to Foreign Nations, or the Enemy. This the several Provinces looked upon, not as a peculiar Propriety, but the common Stock of the League; for bear∣ing the Charge of the Naval-Affairs, which if it fell short by any means, they were for the publick good to make up out of their private Purses. The Zelanders stretched this further, compelling all sorts of Commodities that were brought out of Holland, and pas∣sed by their Islands to other places, to pay another part of Custom with them, which because it could not be hindred, was by a temporary Agreement between the two Provinces confined; But the Hollander renounced this Convention, re∣lying upon an Edict of the United States, which declared, that where Carryage was taken in, there the freight ought to be payd; Besides this, the Zelanders were accused, that by diminishing the Customs and punishments, they had reduced the common Stock into their hands, as of right, and by that meanes, and the like deceits, they had converted all forreign Trade, and the advantages thereof, to themselves, against the Faith and Agreement of so necessary an Allyance: whereto when they answered, that the Hollanders by their Covetousness, obtruded the name of the States, as other∣where the name of the Prince and Senate, that they inter∣mingled in one, many Controversies: Nor did they both cease to prefer their own merits, in the management of the War before those of the other, objecting to each other, sloath and neglect, and if the League should be dissolved, they could among themselves have sufficient strength to maintain and defend their private Affairs. Nay, to such a height, was
the Zelanders fury risen, that they denyed to pay any Tribute to the League, which afterward, other meaner and less con∣siderable People taking into example, it was scarce agreed at length, that some Commodities of Zeland being relin∣quished, for the future, their Authority should be preserved in the great Counsel of the General States. While these things were in Agitation, several Forreign Embassies were heard, where were at large discoursed, the benefits and prayse of Peace, with the miseries and com∣plaints of War, the Spaniard in the interim taking care, not so much to obtain Peace, as to throw the Odium of the War upon the States, as denying and being averse to peace; Among these Embassies, the ingrateful Speech of Paulus Dialius, sent to them from Sigismund, King of Poland, was taken notice of, who in a Latine Speech thundring aloud, when he talked much of the duties of Subjects towards their Princes, he threatned to the Hollanders, certain ruine from the Spanish greatness, unless they acknowledged their fault, and desired Pardon, offering the King his Master as a Media∣tor; but on the contrary, he highly extolled King Philips goodness and fidelity, and that before the Sons and Kinsmen of the Prince of Aurange, and Count Egmonde: no less were the names of Christianity, and that the Turkish Power, though at such distance, hung over their heads with terrour, the hi∣ther Poland to redeem its fear thereof with Peace, having withdrawn it self from the common War. Nor was it un∣known to the States, how the Polander and Spaniard were linked together, both by necessity and Allyance, and which was the nearest tye of all, the Jesuites residence in the Kings Court. To this it was modestly answered, as to cause and danger of Peace, and that the Spaniard waged more cruel Wars against the Christians than the Turks, cut of an excessive am∣bition of Soveraignty. Whereof Sigismund ought rather to take care before any domestick Conjunction. And when
He notwithstanding this, yet grew more cholerick, as if he intended to break off all commerce, they who treated with him, affirmed, that they were in no more need of the Polan∣ders Harvest, if the Laws of humanity should be violated, then the Polanders were of their money. At this time also, the Emperour and Princes of Germany, and the chief City, sent to require Audience of a most mag∣nificent Embassie, which the States, suspecting the prepara∣tion of so great an Authority, excused: whereupon, they sent other Letters by Charles Nutselius, questioning with some bitterness, whether that were the Reverence they bore to the Germane Allyance, and whether they would return this thanks for all the benefits they had received, to deny to them their Friends, what was granted even to Enemies among all Nations: Nor would it be sufficient for the Embassadors onely to treat of Peace, which yet, that it might be without Fraud, and secure, if any occasion should be given, they should diligently take care, but also of many other weighty Affairs, which concerned the Hollanders no less, than the Germans: This Nutselius interpreted to relate to the restau∣ration of the old Leagues, protesting not without threats, that no man should despise the Majesty of the Empire unpun∣ished. To this, the States with great Humility replyed, that they did this onely out of Honour and Reverence to the German name, that they might be premonished, lest they should put themselves to the trouble of a vain and fruitless Embassie: There being no persons in the World, that could better un∣derstand their Affairs, and what was expedient for them, then themselves. With a little more seriousness, came from the King of Denmark, Arnoldus Witfeldius, the President of that King∣dom, and Christian Barnicavius, the same King, as was be∣lieved by most, doing this, rather because he could not re∣fuse it, than of his own accord; for he had been a Fatherly
Friend, both to the House Nassau, and the People of Holland, and besides, prosessed the sincere and reformed Religion, and therefore would require nothing, that might seem fraudulent, either to that or them. But because in Peace God might be more purely worshipped, and both publick and private Affairs, consisted more safely without the chances of War, he hoped they would not look upon him as an unac∣ceptable, or uncapable Authour of so great a good; To these so many and great Advisers of Concord, the States in effect gave one and the same Answer, the words onely vary∣ed, but they wrote to the Dane, with more civility than any of the rest. I will here briefly relate the Reasons of this their Resolve so often before-mentioned, least that passe for currant with the Reader, which they began by often hearing, and repeat∣ing the same things to nauseate. They insisted, that both by the French and English Allyance, and afterwards by the great vertue of Prince Maurice, they were so obliged, that they could not in private, either accept, or suffer any Articles of Peace, which as it would be wicked, so likewise would it be dangerous for them to think, because the thoughts of Peace, though frivolous, yet makes all men more remiss in matters of War, and for the most part, from the liberty and Leagues of Cities, springs, discord and hatred. And at this time, were certain Letters written by William Clement, the Spanish Ora∣tor to the Emperour discovered, which did set forth such hopes, and that the Germans had onely gotten envy from the Hollanders, by their motioning of Peace: And then were added, the examples of divers things done at Breda, Gaunt, Colen, and in Brabant and Flanders, which had much promo∣ted the Enemies snares: After which things, they averred, that they could never hope for an end of the War from the Spanish infidelity, but by the goodness of God, the onely Ruler of Armies, if perchance then the Netherlanders con∣sent might prevail.
A word or two now for the cause: how and under what necessity of labouring, they were compelled to those things, whereof no agreement could make them secure; It was the Interest of their Neighbours, least the King of Spain being eased of so great a War, should grow greater by the addition of those Forces, which should by Peace become subject to him, which if he once attained, he might have alwayes in readiness, an Hundred Thousand Men. Now to oppress and enslave one, anon another. That it was a frequent Speech in the mouths of the Spaniards, that the Hereticks were to be Conquered by the blood of Hereticks; nor did they by that Name, comprehend the followers of the Reformed Religi∣on, as it is called; but also those of the Augustane Confes∣sion, both by their own and the Popes Judgement, and be∣cause that name is no less hated now by the Common-wealth; then of old was that name of King, among the most puissant Romans; and yet there remain some tracks thereof, with those People which affect such a Soveraign Dominion, as is next of all to liberty; neither is that Form of Government, which the Polanders publickly maintain; so much grounded upon the Right of Birth, as the consent of Election, whereof also, the German and Dane retain a Similitude, giving al∣most the same account of their Governments; They say, the Netherlanders were never enslaved, but had alwayes a moderated Empire bounded by Laws; That the care of the Laws was committed from their Ancestors, to such as gave particular Testimonies of Valour and Vertue. That the Inclinations and Affections of Governing by Justice, passed from Father to Son; for then there was no infinite, unbound∣ed, and Arbitrary Power, but it was kept within Assemblies, which made the Name of King, be wholly unknown. Then both Prince and People, had a Confidence and Faith of each other, untill Philip, not onely by perverting Judgement, and exacting things never granted, violated the Oath he had ta∣ken;
but also on the other side, he contemned and said aside, contrary to all Justice and Equity, the true intents of Em∣bassies, dipping his hands in the blood of innumerable Inno∣cents. That which Nature Commands all Creatures, which is the Principle of self-preservation, we have done, and not promiscuously as Libertines, but under the Conduct of a worthy Prince, the Prince of Aurange. In the interim, many Supplications were made to Philip, and the Neighbour-Princes solicited him to mitigate the severity of his Resolu∣tions; But after that Treachery and Revenge were found to lie hid under the pretences of his peace, We removed (which is no new thing among Subjects) him doing by his power, such things as were contrary to his duty as a Prince, and this by a publick Decree, wherein were set forth all the Causes and Motives thereof. And then again it seemed good to some, to Elect for their Prince the King of France his Brother, while others submit∣ted to the power of the Prince of Aurange, which they had no sooner done, but forthwith he was assassinated by Spanish Treachery, and the Succession of Government by his death, devolving to Prince Maurice, who now being supported by the Allyances of sundry great Princes, defendeth and en∣largeth our limits by Arms. I have in this manner declared these things, that among Remote Nations, the Report of Af∣fairs then might be known from the use of matters at present. Nor were the Hollanders satisfied, to shake off the offers of Peace, but that they incited others to take up Arms, ob∣jecting against the Spaniard, his ambition and thirst after Kingdoms, and the greatness of his Power to do mischief, Reproaches of a long standing, which great Empires, very hardly, or never can escape. And for the better winning of Credit hereto, besides the manifest Examples of France and Brittain, were published all Albertus his Demands against
many Cities of Germany, and also a fresh document from Erabant, what might be hoped for touching Religion; The Relation thereof followes. Anna Hovia a Maid, living in Family with her Sisters, to whom she was in nature of a Servant, being suspected of dissenting from the Popes Sanctions, was thrown into Prison, and when they overcome either by the threats, or prayers of her Friends, or the allurement of life, wherewith, even the greatest minds are made to sloop, had begged her Pardon by acknowledging her ignorance, she alone was nothing moved; but in the interim, with modest Speeches, she obtested, that being a Woman, and so both by Sex and Fortune, exempts from troubles, and as she her self believed, main∣taining no false Opinion; but if it were so, that she was guilty of error, who could pardon her for it; for that was an offence, not against men, but God, and he would take vengeance for the same, if any one overcome by fear, against the thoughts of their heart should recant, although it were thereby to maintain the truth; of whom the Senate advising, whether they should give judgement or , Albertus is reported to have made answer, Let the Laws be put in execution. You may the more justly wonder hereat, that so cruel and inhumane a punishment, should yield delight or satis∣faction to any Spectators; for she was buried alive under ground at Bruxells: the Authours of this Barbarisme probably expect∣ing she would have repented; But she now descending into the Cave, and being placed between Death and the Priests, ready to give her absolution, without any shew of fear, calling onely upon God, she was covered over with the Earth, and buried alive. This Womans constancy, was looked upon by all the Netherlanders, with great cmmiseration, Report adding to the novelty of the matter, in re∣gard of old, many millions of Butcheries were transacted upon short and small hearing. And afterwards, Albertus thought it almost enough to punish Crimes of that sort by threatnings, but if at any time he proceeded further, the torments were inflicted in more se∣cret manner.
At this time a return of thanks was made to those several Kings and Princes, who had been solicitous for the peace of the Netherlands, recommending their Affairs in particular to every one of them; And in the interim, by reason of the Arch-Dukes envy, they stirred up all who had any care of Religion, to a severe revenge: The Entertainment and Charge of the Embassadors, was defrayed out of the pub∣lick Stock, out of which also, at their departure, great gifts were given to them. In their Letters to Germany, they excu∣sed several incursions into the adjoyning parts of their Country by the like actions of the Spaniards, and the neces∣sity of the War, whereto there was but one remedy, to wit, utterly to drive them away, as far as was possible: against whose insolency in taking several places of Germany, they had often received a hearing, but never any redress. Where∣upon, they were compelled concerning this affair also to put all their hope in their Arms, which yet should not be preju∣dicial to the Neighbours all about, that were in peace; to which purpose, they had lately augmented the Souldiers pay, that so they might be kept subject by a stricter Discipline; The Danes also seperately and a part requested, that the War, wherein they were altogether unconcerned, might not be made a burthen to them, and that they might not be re∣strained from Spanish Commerce; which Queen Elizabeth, by the same Embassadors, had denyed to the Kings of Den∣mark and Poland, and when they praised nature, who wil∣led the Sea should be open to all, and the right of exchange or Trade be debarred to none, She answered, That there was nothing so congruous to the Customs both of men and nature it self, then to repel danger, and therefore no wise man would suffer him to receive any assistance, who lay at watch for his ruine. Nor did she deny them Arms onely, but all other sores of Provisions whatsoever, avouching in de∣fence of the same, an antient League of the English, with the Anseatike Cities, and the examples of other Princes: deri∣ding
the vanity of Paulus Dialius, behaving himself inso∣lently, protesting, she rather took him for a Herald, then an Orator, nor did she spare his Master Sigismund himself, who she said, was ignorant what belonged to a King, and for that he received his Government but by Election. That his Fa∣ther and Grandfather, when they warred with the Musco∣vile, shewed another kind of respect to England. But this was all the thanks the was like to have, who had by her Embassa∣dors care and pains, delivered Sweden from the Muscovitish War, and freed Poland from the Turks. But the Hollanders not esteeming it just, to prescribe harder Laws to others, then they were willing to submit to themselves, did not intercede hinder other people from going to the Westward, and the E∣nemies Coasts by the same Rule that the United States themselves did. This year were made some expeditions by Sea, begun with great Councels, but by reason of so many incertainties to little or no purpose: for the English encouraged by the yet fresh success of the Cadiz Voyage, made new and great pre∣parations at Sea, to countervail the Enemies designs there, and fall upon the rich Islands of the Azores, with endeavour also to seize and take all Ships coming from the other far di∣stant World; The Queen set forth sixteen strong and well armed Ships, among which, were two taken at Cadiz, to whom the Hollanders joyned twenty of theirs, under the Conduct of their Admiral Warmonde, besides almost three∣score less Vessels for carrying the Souldiery and Instruments of War; wherein were contained some great Artillery for battering of Cities and Towns, together with six thousand Land Souldiers; although they heard that divers numbers of Foot Souldiers were levied, and ready upon all the Sea-Coasts of Spain: The Command as General, both of the Fleet and Souldiers, was committed to the Earl of Essex, for the avoiding those evils, which of late a divided Commission had made them sensible of.
In the Moneth of July, they set Sayl, favoured at first with the calmness of the Sea, and a gentle Northerly Wind; but soon after, the Wind encreasing, and when the Fleet was ar∣rived in the great Ocean, over against Gallicia, the Sea and the Heavens changed Countenance, for the Ships being tos∣sed in the surging Waves of a horrible Sea, divided as well the Counsels of the Commanders, as separated the Ships one from another: Some having more nimble Vessels, were hur∣ried in oblique courses, even into the Coasts and sight of Spain, and many wearied by the Sea and dangers, that they might the sooner return into their Country, of their free wills followed the pleasure of the Winds: But although the Earl of Essex his Ship was restrained by the loss of her Masts, and the springing of several great Leaks, so that the entring Water, could hardly be exhausted by all the toyl and labour of the Pump; yet did he still endeavour to go for∣ward, and steere his course, even in despight of Fortune. Until at last, all sight being taken away with the thick dark∣ness of the Clouds, and the sense of hearing, become useless by the out-cryes of such as were over-charged with fear, the dashing of the Waves, and the blustring of the Winds, pre∣sent fear had made the Seamen senseless of their duties, so that there was no obedience to Commands. Thus, by the consent of the Commanders, most of the Ships having many Leaks, so that they could hardly be kept upright with all their labour, yet at last, he brought them all back into England safe, the tenth day after he went out, where while they waited for their Companions, and contrary Winds detain them in the Port, by scarcity of Provisions, and the increasing of Diseases, they were compelled to dis∣miss their Ships of burden and Souldiers, retaining onely one Regiment, which being well Disciplined in Mi∣litary Affairs, Sir Francis Vere had brought thither by the consent of the Hollanders: And now their Counsels being contracted as their Forces, and the hope of a Land War to∣tally
lost, it was thought convenient to wait about the Islands of Azores, to intercept the great Fleet now ready to return from the Indies; But the English Ships being again torn and spoyled, by cruel Tempests, Essex having long compassed the Sea, and wasting the Islands, was at last, by the error of his Pilots, carryed out of his way, and Sir Walter Rawleigh, not a∣ble any longer to be subject to Command, took his course, though without any certainty, another way. The Spaniards in the mean while, arrive at the Port of Augra, on the contrary part of the Isle Tercera, the most powerful of all the Azores, and bringing with them infinite Wealth. But the English by cross and contrary Winds, and other imminent evills were so kept back, that they could not come near them: yet three Ships being seperated from their Company, were either sunk or taken and made a prey. Here began a mischievous contest, the Hollanders accusing Raw∣leigh, who had Command of a part of the English Fleet, that he by force took away from them, a Ship which they had ta∣ken, while they were in pursuit of another. In this Voyage, some small and open Towns were burned by the English, as also a Carack coming from the Indies, was fired by her own men, to prevent the falling thereof into the Enemies hands. The Commanders thus frustrated of their hope, and returning to winter in England, were derided by their evill willers, so that being before emulous among themselves, and now become enemies, yet they consented to aver sound advise, and their own endeavours not wanting for prevention of their ill success. Hereby appears that fortune is not to be commanded by wise men, nor forced by just ones. The case of Padilia was harder, who was sent with like Commands as of late out of Spain, to indammage Brittain, with one hundred and eight Ships, wherein were embarqued eight thousand men: for having made a large progress, by the boysterous North-winds, three Galcoones, six other Ships, and a
great quantity of men and money was drowned. Padilia returning home, whether guilty of imprudence or Infelicity, in his unfortunate Attempts, was removed from being Admiral of the Fleet, to whom, in the same place, suc∣ceeded Didaco Brocurus. This Summer, four Holland Ships, which had sailed out three years before, were the first that returned from the Io∣dies: Nor was the Citizens joy greater then their admirati∣on, when they heard tell of men circumcised, whose genitals onely being covered, the rest of their Bodies was quite na∣ked, living about those parts where you go out of Africa, into the East, and inhabiting the Island of Madagascar, These neither well knew, nor are totally ignorant of God; Their miserable genius prompting them to all manner of li∣centiousness: nor distinguishing themselves by names, nor knowing any varieties of seasons, and so ignorant of our man∣ners and Customs, that they would give in exchange for a small quantity of Tin, a good Oxe. They related also, the dangerous sedition of the Marriners, notwithstanding all these dangers: together, with the persidious natures of the Barbarians, whom the Portugueses brought up every where, but especially in Java, that under the pretence of peace, they might the better hide their murthers and depredations. From hence proceeded as well fighting as delayes: Not were the Hollanders free from fault, for they that were sent thither by their Kinsfolks or Friends, being such as were for∣ced from their own Country, either by debt, or their own wickedness, yielded to the Barbarians nothing but an evill pattern to follow. Nay, so great was the stupidity of some of them, that among all the people at noon-day, they sound∣ed the depth of the Haven at Bantam. Java is an Island almost as big as England, and not as some believe, a part of the South Continent, as appeared by the Circuit. It hath many Kings, a part of them according to the Custom of their Fathers, worship false Gods, the other part
not long since have received the Mahometan Doctrine. They saw also Sumatra, the greater Java, and a little Island called Balis: and in their return another, which is called by the name of Helena, fruitful in the product of many things, but not inhabited by any men: From hence the Hollanders then first began to fetch Pep∣per and other Fruits, the usual growth of those warmer Cly∣mates, which kind of Trade had of old been very gainful to the Venetians, by Egyptian Transportations; but for the space of an hundred years, solely usurped by the Portugueses, who discovered that Ocean, and claimed the same as their re∣ward of their long Navigations, and the gift of the Pope. The first Voyage after many difficulties, being free from da∣mage, yet for the future, gave hope of better advantage, and invited many others out of Holland, Zeland, and exiles of Brabant, to attempt the same with a greater number of Ships. From the beginning of the Spring for many moneths, had the Siege of Amiens been delayed, while the King, though with a strong Army of fourteen thousand men, yet sparing of his own Souldiers blood, and not greedy of his Enemies, onely fortified his Camp against all force, as well inward as outward. And first he endeavoured to raise a Confederacy among the Citizens, and when that was discovered, he at∣tempted to fill up the Trenches, undermine the Rampire, and to do other things, which though they cost little blood, yet they took up great expence of time, especially the Be∣siegers being unexperienced in such works, and the Besieged wanting neither Valor or Policy to withstand the same, and to protract the Siege in hope of getting Relief, and having turned out of the Town, above six thousand Citizens, whom they suspected. Besides, while the Enemy was gathering to∣gether his force, a Body of Horse entred the Town, thereby both strengthning and augmenting the Garrison. And al∣though they were infested with the Plague, yet they made
frequent Sallies in defence of their Walls, with various For∣tune; in several of wch, divers eminent men on both sides were slain, among whom was Portocarrera, the main Author of all their Stratagems: Yet the Townsmen, by cutting their Bark turned the River upon the Enemy. And after many Repulses, caused by neglect of such as were sent to enter the City, the Arch-Duke in Autumn, with his new and old Forces, and ac∣cording to antient Custom, having raised the Netherlandish Nobility, which were modelled into Horse and Foot, came thither with more Fame than Hope. At the first sight, he perceived, that it was not possible, either to force the King's Works, nor to draw the coming Enemy, though more than ordinarily cautious, to the hazard of a Battel: Onely some few loose Bands encountred. But now Picardy being wasted by War, was first afflicted with scarcity of Victuals and soon after with Sickness. These Things forced the Arch-Duke to depart, overcome almost with Sorrow, for loss of the City, which (a Truce of eight days, according to Agreement be∣ing elapsed, which was, that if in that they were not relie∣ved with above a Thousand men) was deliver'd up to King Henry; & Albertus, that the King might the less persist in his Successes, by scarcity of Victuals, and fear of the Winter, left the Siege of Dorlens. Soon after that, Albertus sent part of his Souldiers to block up all the Avenues of Ostend with Forts, at the Re∣quest of the Flandrians; for as yet having sent Spies to seated the strength of all Fortifications about the place, as well to the Seaward, as Land, and conscious to himself of his own weakness, he durst not attempt the Siege of it. In the mean while, Devastations being hindred, Sir Edward Noris being made Governour there, raged scot-free all over the Coun∣try, being grown more terrible to the Enemy, because he had lately taken Alvares Agilarius, the Governour of Dunkirk, prisoner, with some other booty. Here I have a mind to draw all Affairs into one Series, until the end of the Year,
that I may not place what was done during that time by the Hollanders, or continued by them apart. They were quiet the greatest part of the Summer, while France detained their Money, and England their Souldiers, either expecting other business, or hoping some Sedition among the Enemies. But now Albertus his Forces being all recalled from Amions, there was a necessity for some action, but not resolved whither to carry the War, their Affections wavering towards divers places, until at length it was left to the Judgment of the Prince, Count William, and the Se∣nate; who thought it convenient, to drive the Enemy out of the Garrisons in Overissel, whereof the Spaniard had not ma∣ny remained, but they which were, were governed and kept by Frederick Count Heremberg, that so the War being remo∣ved within the Rhine, all that part of the Country that lyes beyond, might be exempted from payment of Contribution to the Enemy; and that they might compass this with the more safety (for they had not equal Forces at Home to cope with the Enemy; and, it might be doubted, least the Spa∣niard might alter his Counsel, and come back) they thought fit to put off the Journey to some following time, with Com∣mands where the Rhine might be passed: The same thing also proved famously advantagious, for the safety of the Bor∣ders; and that there might be a safe Passage into Germany opened, which was now shut up by the Enemy, to the great damage of Trade, while it is prohibited to carry through Ri∣vers what was taken at Sea, and to carry back other things in lieu thereof. At this time Henry Frederick entring into the 14th Year of his Age, having till those years spent his time at Leyden, in the study of the Liberal Sciences, was first taken to be in∣structed in the Rudiments of War: With which Compa∣nion, and many others of the same House, the Prince, and the rest of the Commanders, having privately held a Coun∣cil,
go towards Gravewaert, so that the Enemy might not be aware, to what place chiefly they intended. He had Seven Thousand Foot, and Twelve Hundred Horse, who passed the Rhine in little Boats, and the Wael by a Bridge of Ships fast∣ned together, carrying along with them their Waggons and Baggage. But the Ships, by force of the Wind, were carryed up the Rivers, wherein were contained forty great Guns fit for Battery, and the rest of the Provisions proportionable. The Army marched along the Banks, which of old was called the Gallick, or rather the Romane Cawsey, and in their Jour∣ney, upon sight of the Army and Artillery, Fort Alba, a Hold of unreasonable strength, was without delay surren∣dred; and the same Evening, some Horse were sent out to encompass Berck. There are some who would have this Town to be the Tiberiacum of the Antients, and that there yet re∣mains some glimmering of the same in the word Berck, as it is now contracted. It is a small Town, but rich in Customs; for lying upon that Bank of the Rhine, which as we said, is beyond Xantem, which is also known by the Name of Ve∣teracastra, being a place famous in former Ages, for the Siege of the Legions, and the War of Holland: A little upon the one hand appeareth Wesel, near the back of Gelderland; but both sides of it are inclosed by the Regions of Cleves and Juilliers. It is within the Jurisdiction of the Arch-Bishop of Colen; but the Duke of Parma, under pretence of the Truxi∣an War before-mentioned, after much contest, seized and possessed it; for safety whereof, besides the sweetness of the place, and the Antiquity of the Fortifications, there was kept in it a Garrison of no less than a Thousand Men, part Ne∣therlanders, part Germans: In the upper part of the River, there is an Island three miles in compass, adjoyning to the Town, and separated onely by a River. Hither the Prince sent a sufficient number of men to guard it, and made a Bridge over the Channel, that there might be a secure Way
for Pastures, and other Provisions. Afterwards he pitched his Camp chiefly in two places, although at that time the Weather was very raging; and that no place might be left open, a Line, with a Trench, was commanded to be drawn on both sides the River all along. Thus the Town was shut up, many ships stopping the passages of the Rhine; And all Forts, whether in Ways, or upon meaner Rivers, were strengthned and maintained by the Guard of the Beleaguer∣ers by turns; which afterwards being laid aside, there was another great Work raised against the Town, for the securing Passages from place to place; nor had the Besieged either Valour or Confidence enough to disturb their Enemies Work by Sllies, they onely vindicating themselves by shot at a distance, having the greatest plenty of Ammunition, though indeed they wanted nothing else; for there were found in the City almost fourscore great Guns, with these they had furnished the Fortifications, to resist any thing that might oppose the Town. The chief Defence against all such Damages was a Tower, which raised its height somewhat above the Palace, and so infested all the places near the Ri∣ver; from hence arose Pity, Fear, and Wrath, to many falling in the Camp; for Lewis of Nassau was shot in the Thigh, and the Prince himself was not free from danger, for by ac∣cident his Tent was overthrown; yet the Besiegers began to set in order their Canon against the Town, whereby the be∣fore-mentioned Tower was so weakned, that none durst re∣main or stay therein: Hitherto all that was done, was by snatches and intervals, as it were at a breathing. Afterwards the Trench was filled up, and although the Weathe were very bad, by reason of continual Rains; yet the Galleries began to be wrought on forward to the very Rampire, to a great breadth: The Artillery never ceasing, to ba the Gate, which lay upon the River from the Island before-mentioned. This caused the Besiegers to send Messengers, that should Treat about the delivery of the Town, it being
manifest to them, that those Threats were not in vain, in re∣gard they beheld and felt the Fore-runners of a Storm; yet could not all their Prayers at the present, prevail to obtain a Truce, the Battery continuing all that day, with the expense of Two Thousand shot. In this interim also, William of Nassau had assaulted and taken an Half-Moon Sconce that lay upon the River, the Defendants being beaten out thereof by violence of shoot∣ing. Now also was the Courage of the Besieged utterly over∣thrown by a sharp Summons, whereby they were advised to prevent Extremity; and that if they should yet continue in their Obstinacy, they should be exempted from Mercy. Thus on the Tenth day was Berck deliver'd, the whole Garrison marching forth with all that belonged to them. All the pub∣like Stores of the Enemy, together with the Artillery and Ships, were (according to Custom) deliver'd to the Conqueror. Some there are, who lay the fault of this Surrender, upon a too suddain fear, especially for that Herman Count Herem∣berg, Governour of Gelderland, came to the Garrison, either because the Commander in Chief there was blame-worthy, being an immoderate Boaster, and before the appearance of danger beyond measure insolent; or else that the Souldiers were equally criminal, whom presently after their going out of Gelderland, many reprehended as growing Seditious with∣in the Town: This thing done, Legates were sent from the Arch-Bishop of Colen, and the Colledge of Priests, to the Prince, with Command to go from him to the States, to de∣mand the re-delivery of that being a Free Town, and not obnoxious to their War. But the great conveniency of the place, moved the States to return an Answer in these terms: Although whatsoever was possessed by our Enemies, and taken from them by War, may seem ours by right of Victory, yet the  Confidence you have of the Batavian's Equity, is not alto∣gether
vain, since what hath been so long permitted, to undergo the Yoke of Spanish Tyranny, you are not ashamed to challenge out of our hands: We would truly have given way of our own ac∣cord, unless that former Action had taught us, that you your∣selves were unable to defend it: And certainly, he is deservedly wretched, that will be deceived by another mans slothfulness. Now if the Spaniard may reside still at Berck, you ought also to take the same Care both for Bonne and Nuiss. We are continually ex∣hausted and damaged by Excursions: Nay, our own Land, and the common River is taken from us, so that we shall be said not to restore, but to have given you the City: Rather then so, still be∣lieve it to be yours, and that it is ours a Pledge onely against dan∣ger, and a caution for our Expences, which in all Reason and Ju∣stice you ought to pay, if we have conquered the same for you; notwithstanding which, we promise that the Revenues which the Bishop usually received thence, shall carefully be reserved to his use. With these Words the Legates were dismissed; nor did the States as yet fortifie this Town of Berck as their own, for they onely repaired the Breaches made by the Batteries and Assaults, and placed therein for Defence of the place a Regiment of Foot, with a few Horse; and that no part might lye open to the Enemy, they levelled Mutelen to the ground, because it seemed too far off, to fortifie and defend the same sufficiently. Camillus Sachino, who was in Command under the Duke of Parma, had raised that Castle upon the Bank of the Rhine, in an excellent scituation, and as was believed, in the very place of old Duysburg: the original of which Town the old Germans refer to the fabulous Wandrings of Ulysses. And being the Duke of Parma's Countrey-man, gave the Name to this place, as promising to himself wi s doubt, by that Work, the perpetuating of his Fame, and ontinua∣tion of his Memory to after-Ages: But at that time the Count Hohenlo accidentally passing that way in his Journey, with a
small Reinue towards Germany, it was with great fear de∣setted, and by the Prince's Command levelled with the ground, the Italian's Arrogance being looked on with Con∣tempt, who (to speak his own words) affirmed it to be built in the height of his Courage, to such advantage, that it was inexpugnable. At this time the United States writ to the Princes of New∣enberg, and Brandenburg, wishing them rather to lay open to them a Passage into the Dukedom of Cleves in reality, than to Tantalize them with empty Words and Promises, and to leave it to them, to lay hold on a fit time to vindicate Right. In those parts of the Bishoprick of Colen, yet under the Pa∣tronage of the Dutchy of Cleves, is scituate Moers. The Proprietors whereof were called Counts, and the last Heir of which was Valburgis, innobled of old by an intermarriage with the Count of Horn, and through the Duke of Alva's Cruelty a Widow, and now again intermarryed, and the Wi∣dow of a related Family the Count Menar. She living a∣mong the Hollanders, the Spaniard had possessed both the Town and Castle, being a considerable strength, above eleven years, with a strong Garrison, whose number was increased to above eight hundred, by the Count Herman of Herem∣berg, upon the Report of the Siege of Berck, being other∣wise helpless, and unable to have resisted. Wherefore taking along with him the rest of the Forces that were left, he re∣treated beyond the Maes: From whose Bank the Town ly∣eth a little distant, by which means an access thereto is more easie for the Enemy, and greater damage accrewing to the Besiegers: In this well-known Site, the Prince in two seve∣ral places setled his Force, but without any defensive Trench, and their nearer Approaches which they had begun, were retarded by the Autumnal Showers, yet the Day brought them to the Ditch, which in three places was filled up.
Hitherto no great Guns had vomited Thunder to the Battery, or Ruin of the Works, though the Prince had com∣manded many to be planted, and a Bridge to be prepared as for an Assault, when unexpectedly the Governour of the Town and Castle (his name was Andrew Miranda, by Nation a Spaniard) came to a Treaty, Pledges on both sides being given (although a little before, being summon'd by Letters from Prince Maurice, That if he could defend the Ca∣stle, yet he should take pity upon the Town, and not leave the Citi∣zens lying to the severity of War. He returned a proud and un∣civil Answer): The Souldiers that marched out were per∣mitted by Article to carry away their Colours, Arms, and one great Gun; the Prince, by the Concessions of these Ho∣norary Vacuities, redeeming the War from delay, and the Enemy, under the pretence of a Titulary Repute, flattering himself in his own disgrace, notwithstanding he pretended a want of Gunpowder, beyond the Exemplar of Berck; but certainly he might have furnished himself with those things, neither indeed could he have wanted means to have mode∣rately relieved the Town, but that Fear wholly prevented their Care. While the Frizon Forces attended Prince Maurice, in the mean while Frederick Count Heremberg, drawing the Garri∣son Souldiers out of Lingen, and other Towns, into that part of Frizeland, which is called Septemsylue, began to wast and burn the Villages thereof, carrying away many prisoners, and a great Booty: Nevertheless private damages did no way put a stop to publike Endeavours; wherefore the Hollanders Army passing the Rhine by a Bridge, thereabouts where the Village called Rees. And here also the same Fortune fol∣lowed the Conquerours, none daring to resist them; for Al∣bertus had resolved to lye on the French Borders, which made the Garrisons in these parts the more afraid.
If I should commemorate like Wars among the Antients, and the concurring strength of divers ssant Kingdoms and People into one Body, by a like Simde and Alliance of Chance, it would be no wonder, though I should weary my self in the plentiful recital thereof, and should undertake the Toil of deciphering all both persons and places, where such Things have been seen: But my Work is circumscribed and brought into a narrower Compass; for here is not to be declared the Conjunctions of Allies, fatal Battels, eminent Slaughters, and great Dangers; but onely the Sieges and Assaults of some mean Towns, and that too, if I discern any thing, more for advantage and gain, than pleasure or ambi∣tion. For in many other Parts there have been of old, yea even among our own Ancestors, more numerous Armies, Fifty or Threescore Thousand have been oft muster'd in the Fields, sufficient to have drawn after them, in common Judgment, the success of a War: in which Tempestuous Meetings, the whole Discipline depended, in nothing more, than to equalize Valour, keep footing, and drive away the Enemy. But the following Age participated of less Cruel∣ty, by the use of more Policy; nor, as before, were the ha∣zards of War run upon at adventure, to the decision of a Quarrel at a Fight, but by fortifying against intervening Dangers; and, on the contrary, when a visible strength is found either near or far off, to lay open all fenced places, dry up all Fenny and Moorish Parts, to fill up Valleys, and level Hills: Which if any one would sift out and Value, accord∣ing to the Experience of the Times and the War, no Land before our own could shew the like Patterns, where a man might find Cities either more strong, or more frequent. Hi∣ther have been brought all the Politike Inventions, both of Pristine and Modern Warfare, the long continuance of the War having drawn from all Parts Foreign Spectators, as to a publike School of War.
For at this very time the chief Dukes, Counts, and Great Commanders, as well out of Germany, France, Britain, as from other more remote Parts, follow'd the Prince in the ma∣nagement of the War in Over-Issel. Himself went beyond the River Lippe in Germany, but the Ships were conveyed through the Rhine, and so into the Issel, till they arrived at Doesburg. A little further inward lies Grolle, within the Jurisdiction of Zutphen, which having been besieged for∣merly about two years ago, though in vain, did seem to be a Reproach to the Prince, unless it were taken. The Fortifica∣tions of this Town were not ordinary, boasting the Care of the Emperour Charles the Fifth for their strength and Li∣mits. There were five great Bulwarks standing out from the Rampire, with such Flankers, as commanded on every side any that should venter to assault it: The compass of the City is but small, and under the Government of John Count Strumbo, with a Garison of eight hundred Foor, and three Troops of Horse; nor had he omitted, when he heard of the Prince's Approach towards him, to amend and make thicker his Works: But the Prince nothing affrighted therewith, but esteeming it very advantageous, that the Enemies Horse should be shut up, which otherwise might possess and infest the Ways, straight with more than ordinary diligence, to prevent any suddain Sallies, by one continued Trench with interposed Forts, in one Night he quite inclosed two parts of the City, Eight hundred Souldiers were designed to the Work, and were guarded by Two Thousand others in Arms. The next Night he encompassed with like Expedition the two remaining parts; in the day time the Works were made more strong and compleat; from thence towards the Towns, the way was broken by many Turnings and Windings, which while they were made, and soon after, the Water brought thither, which before had been contained in the Town Trenches, they were quickly fill'd up with Earth. The
Besieged were very obstinate, in their denying to surrender, by all means endeavouring to revenge themselves with their Guns, and by their frequent Sallies, until Prince Maurice his Gunners shot fire into the Town; which taking, and expa∣tiating it self to the burning of above Threescore Houses, made them turn all their Care from the hindring of the Prince's Works, to the preservation of themselves, and what belonged to them: Nor yet did faint, although they were afflicted with Fire and Wounds within, and with the terri∣ble Fear of unknown Miseries from abroad, having in two places begun some inward or second Works, for their better Defence, in case the old Works before them should be beaten down and become useless. But afterwards, when the Prince had wrought seven Galleries, unto the very Rampire of the Town, which he commanded to be undermined and blown up; and likewise that Four and Twenty Pieces of Canon should be drawn down for Battery, that so the Town might on all sides be laid open by Breaches: The Garison recant∣ed their Obstinacy, and craved Pardon, which was granted to them. This was the 17th Day of the Siege; some were appointed, to conduct the Enemy marching off with his Hor∣ses, and Colours, and Waggons, and Ships to carry away such as were sick; but upon all was laid this Restriction, That within three Months they should not bear Arms about the River Maes. About two hours Journey from Grolle, is distant Breefoort, a small Town of the same Jurisdiction; but, for the strength of the same, reckoned among the chief; for one continued Work runs round the Town: no is there any passing beyond it, but by one narrow Path, every place else all about being incompassed with unpassable Marishes and Moors, which a man no sooner treads upon, but he sticks in the Mud and Dirt: so that there was no way to go on to an Assault, not any place to pitch a Camp, for continuing the Siege.
Nor were other Things provided with less Care; The Wall being of very antient Work, was surrounded with a very deep Trench, which was the Work of Martino Rossem, when he made Wars in those Parts Fourty Years before: Three hundred Souldiers were sufficient to maintain the small Circumference of the Works about this small Town. But it was reported, that both these, and the Townsmen, were in Contest, and had a difference with the Governour, whose Name was Gardoto, by which means greater strength was added to their fear of our extrinsick Terrour. Neverthe∣less, they were not hearkned to, that urged a Surrender, as repining at the Governours Authority, in whom there was too much Courage, for the present Condition of Affairs there; or else for that their Confidence, in the strength of the place, with those helps before-mentioned, had made them all agree in this. But Prince Maurice persisting, the Souldiers were much troubled with the appearance of so great Labour, and the vastness of the Marishes more offended, than their daily Conflicts with the Enemy; especially, because they were ignorant, what Swllows and Quagmires lay hid in the de∣ceitful Nature of the Soil: For the Ground which lately was firm and solid, by the then wetness of the Season with continual Showers, were overflow'd and cover'd with Wa∣ter; so that where-ever they went, there was nothing but a thick stiff Mud, and no safety or certainty any where; not could they find any Ground fit to raise a Breastwork in. But when the Prince had with great Diligence used all the Arts formerly tryed at Gertruydenberg, and Coeverden, all these Difficulties were by Experience mollified; And himself be∣came hoth an Advisor and Director of the Work, sending put of the Forces under Count Solmes, and Col. Brederode, into those places that answer'd to the Gates; that which lay in the middle towards the North, being the most difficult, he reserved to himself.
The Moory places he made firm, by stuffing them with Stones, Wood, and other sound Earth, laying over all Planks, and into the deeper Water were thrown Bundles of great Rushes and Brushwood. Thus, upon this made Ground, Hurdles being set upright, with Earth between them, at small distance, served both for Blinds and Defence, by this means a Breastwork was brought even to the Hill hard by the Town, but much helped by the singular industry of the Sea-men, whose continual being in danger makes them fearless: There was erected a Platform for Twenty Canon, and so much pains was taken in eight days, that they were gotten to the very Trench of the Town: But there was no Expe∣dient found to drain the Water from thence, for that the daily Rains, and the lower Springs in all that open Country, still more and more supplied and filled it. This, together with the Promise of Count Frederick Hereinberg, to send Three Hundred Souldiers to their Relief, through the Shallows, so heigntned the Confidence of the Besieged, that they yet re∣fused to surrender: Whereupon now the whole Camp in∣tended a Storm, nor were the Captains backward, especially the English, who having lost many of their men, were inci∣ted by the Prince and incouraged, that at length after their Toilsom Labour in digging, they should be rewarded with the bloud and spoil of their Enemies: Protesting, since the Enemy had had so many Examples of his Clemency, which he had refused, that now he should feel the severity of their Revenge. That there was a method in Pardon, as in all other Things, and Limits within which it is lawful to resist or re∣lent; That Terrour and Moderation, are turned to Glory and Advantage, when too much Lenity breeds nothing but Contempt and Pride; That for all this, there ought to be Concessions of Favour, in all publike Dealings of War, for the Honour and Encouragement of Military Vertue, least the Victory should at any time set upon unfortunate Valour, the undeserved Stamp of a Vice: But on the other side, if
any shall despise, and mock at Threats and certain Destru∣ction, it was never known, but that such weak Pretenders to Honour, suffer'd the punishment of their own Delay. Wherefore the Prince beginning his Batteries, had beaten down with his Artillery the Towers and Steeples, at also the Tops of the Bulwarks and Fortifications; among which, the Rampire without the Gate, having been long batter'd, at last was taken; And the Besieged defended the Ruines of their Lines and Works with their Bodies and strength, throwing down upon the Prince's men, as well great Bullets as Stones: The Trench alone kept off the Assault till this time; but now a Bridge of Cork prepared not far off, was soon brought thither: And this being a Work full of danger, was undertaken by the Sea-men; for they, not waiting for the Word of Command, began to undermine the Rampire, not so much as minding their own Weapons, which they had carryed thither with them. At the sight of the Bridge, as some stupendious Wonder, the whole People of the Town were affrighted, so that they could neither agree in Labour or Design for a space▪ But at last, leaving off all other busi∣ness, all flocked to that part: But when they saw their Ene∣mies advancing with certain steps, and in a plain and even way, and others to stand behind with glistring Ensigns, fierce Looks, and threatning Weapons, and that the noise and whistling of Bullets had now taken away all the Advanta∣ges and Opportunities of Speaking or Hearing, they shewed up and down their Heads, and the Coverings thereof, which were a sure token that they sought for Peace: Whereto, when Prince Maurice's men gave no other Answer than Wounds, then flying back into the Castle yet intire, they left to the Rage and Fury of the Pursuers, a miserable Company of Women and Children, who falling upon their Knees with elevated Hands, although to an angry Victor, yet either their Sex or Age procured Mercy. About Seventy were killed in
the flight; they who had entred the Castle, forthwith deli∣ver'd both it and themselves to the Prince's power; who joyful, that, after the satisfaction of his Revenge, there was yet opportunity for him to shew mercy, gave them their Lives, and set mulct upon them, which they were to pay to the Conquering Souldiers, and to that purpose he took Hosta∣ges of them: But afterwards this also was remitted, towards the re-building of Houses, which had been there burned, which hapned to begin in the Night, by means of a burning Bullet, which lying unobserved, among many others that were cooled, set fire on many Houses, the flame much increa∣sing, by the great quantities of Straw scatter'd all about: And in the mean while, the Governour no less conscious to him∣self of the hatred of his own men, for his severity towards them, then fearful of the Enemies indignation, and doubt∣ing least the Souldier would expiate his own pertinacy, by the punishment of his Captains, did not fly with the Multi∣tude, but hid himself in a dark and close Cave under the Town, there expecting better Times; whence being drawn out, as he stood before Prince Maurice, retaining much of his old Contumacy, he began to dispute for himself, concern∣ing the truth of the differing Parties, and many other Things, which at such a time, when all Affairs were in such disorder, are neither wisely, nor with safety spoken of: Whereto, when the Prince, even against his Nature, had bid forced, he laid all the fult thereof upon him, by whose pu∣nishment so great mischief should in some sort be made sa∣tisfaction for, with much more Justice, than the bloud of the People or Souldiers: At the heaing of which Sentence, both his Speech and Countenance were quickly alter'd, till humbling himself with many submissive Prayers and Tears, at last his Life was re-granted to him. Now were some few days allotted to the Souldiers, for refreshment of their Bo∣dies, as well against the past, as the future Labours they were
to undergo, wherein they were not a little comforted with the Booty they had got; for all the Neighborhood round a∣bout had brought thither their Goods, and left them there as in a most safe Repository. Soon after this, the Army marched in a Rainy, Season▪ through a dirty Country, into Over-Issel, now filled with Warre, the Terrour whereof had already gained many Towns, though indeed there were few there comparable with the former; for Gouen was deserted of it self, and the Garrison of Euschede, part of them were met and slain in the March; and they that remained, affrighted to see and hear so much, removed away their Guns, and that was e∣nough for them. From hence the Army was divided to go part of it to Otmarsen, and part to Oldenzeel: It is supposed, that both these Towns drew their Original from the Marsi, and the Salii (sometimes noble Nations of Germany) where∣of, yet appears some Glimmerings in their Names. And now is Otmarsen, which we related five years ago to be lost and taken from Us, re-taken by Us in an instant: For the Soul∣diers made no delay, but demanded it of the Enemy, batter∣ing the Walls with their great Guns, to make them believe the necessity of their Surrender the greater. Oldenzeele held out three days, for there were three Rampires and Trenches round about the Town, and six Companies fill'd up the Dit∣ches and the rest of the Works; though the number of the Town Souldiers did not answer the Report made of them, yet were they such, as having been old Souldiers, might well supply the place of a greater number. These, to ingratiate themselves with the Townsmen, urged a speedy Surrender of the Town, least the houses, by any pretence of delay; should be batter'd down or spoil'd. Thus did these two Town; fall into the Prince's hand at once; and, by Decree of the Deputies of Over-Issel, the Works were thrown down and dismantled, because they did not think them worthy of Repair, and were afraid, lest if they
should be left so as they then were, they might invite the Enemy to a too suddain Return. There remained yet one, and that a very difficult piece of Work, in regard the Winter approached, which was to quiet all the right side of the Rhine. For that part of Germany, which hath grown into one Body with the Neherlanders, both in Name and Government, contains towards the East the People of Westfalia; and, near the Sea-shore, those of Emblen. Upon these Confines, Lingen is scituate, beyond the River Eemes, being the Hereditary Demesnes of the Family of Telnborg: But the Emperour Charles, in that War when he made the League of Smalcalde, drew to himself the Pos∣session thereof, though formerly given to Maximilian Count Buren, as a Reward of his Service in the Wars; for he was desirous to inlarge the old Bounds, and that he might obtrude Garrisons more into that Country, and in time come to com∣mand unto the further Bank, where men pass to Hamburgh and Breme, Sea-Coast Towns of Germany. This City and Country adjoyning, the Prince of Aurange had, among other things, accepted as a Gift, at what time through Civil Discords, he enjoyed the most happy Affections of the Ne∣therlanders. The strength of Lingen was not over-great, although Fre∣derick late Count Heremberg, by the Advice of a Renegade. had begun to fortifie the same anew; but the Castle was of a competent strength, being incompassed with a Winding Bulwork, which contained four Half-Moons, each at an equal distance. At this time six hundred men lay there in Garion, most of them Foot, with a small party of Horse, but without all doubt, the choice of all the King's Cavalry: That there were no more, was occasion'd by an Oath, whereby they that had gone out of the next Towns, were o bidden to fight be∣yond the Rhine, during the space of three Moneths: It was observed by them, who were wont to judge of Things after the Event, that the Spaniards had done more politikely,
when they saw there was no hopes to break up the Siege, if they had gather'd their Forces together, though to the leav∣ing open and hazard of other parts; whereas now, the rest being lost, they had all reduced themselves hither, as if they intended with all their Forces to contest there, for the last Fort and strong Hold of their Government. They had here also both Brass and Iron Guns, and other Instruments, both for Defence, and Offence, Against this Town Prince Mau∣rice, having sent before some to possess the Passage of the Ri∣ver Dincle, and himself following the fourth day after, pitch∣ed beyond the Eemes, where he found the Enemy wasting the Villages and Houses with Fire; by which means, he was compelled to quarter the Souldiers in the Villages at a grea∣ter distance from the Town: There then he pitched his Camp, without any fear of an Enemy from abroad, aking no care on their back-side, and but meanly fortifying their Front: Against the Town Batteries, they raised Batteries in the Camp, and drew a Line against any suddain Sallies that should be made by the Besieged: At this time, the Air was more mild, than usually at that Season of the Year, and the Ground easily swelling into little Hillocks, much facilitated the privacy of working. And now, that which was wet with the Water being penetrated, some being beaten back by the Townsmen, discover'd to them the secret Way, to the great destruction of such as came thither; and not onely so, but such of Prince Maurice's men, as came for Supplies, were shot at with so much vehemency, that with the fire from the Guns, the Castle seemed to be all in a flame: And this was ten done with the less hazard, because the Prince, in hast∣ning his Expedition, had onely brought with him a few light Field-pieces; the greater being commanded to be brought through the Mouth of the Eemes, by an easie Passage of the Ships, until the Wind and the Tide should meet: And as soon as they were arrived, the whole heat of the Siege con∣tinued
about the Castle; for Count Heremberg had brought thither all the main of his strength, and the Prince was spa∣ring in the Assaults of the Town, as hoping shortly it would be his own, lest if he batter the Works of it, and so take it first, it should after he ruinated from the Castle: And here they met with a hard piece of Work, which was to draw a∣way the Water in the Ditch, before which lay a Bulwark, strongly defended by the Besieged; so that as i was beaten down, by any means they endeavour'd to raise it a new: But when at length continual Batteries had laid it quite slat, the Ditch being fill'd up, and alleries made, then was sent to them a Summons, which had hitherto been delay'd, by reason of the Scoffs which had bin put upon others in former Sieges; adding withall, That as this was the first, so also should it be their last Summons. Count Heremberg hearing that, and ha∣ving received Letters from Albertus, whereby he was com∣manded to have both his own, and his Souldiers Lives, for better Services, upon the 16th Day after the beginning of the Siege, deliver'd up both the Town and Castle; thus be∣ing by his Kinsmans Valour deprived, and put out of the Command, which he had hitherto obtaind and kept. This Action thus finished, the Souldiers were drawn into Winter-Quarters; And as the Fame of the Prince's Actions was glo∣rious abroad, so was his happy Return, (which in 3 Moneths time, and with so small Forces, had compassed such long Marches through divers Countries, and reduced them from the Contribution and Prey of the Enemy, for the future to be safe by the Boundaries of Rivers) was celebrated with the more than ordinary Affection and Joy, both of the States and People. Insomuch, that some of the Princes of Germany, publikely in their Dyet made the Motion, That he might be made General of the War against the Turks, whose Valour and Fortune, it was probable, would put new Life into the Hungarian Affairs, which then lay gasping through unprosperous Successes.
But this Joy did not continue long without a Repulse, being interupted by a Domestick Affliction, because his Si∣ster Aemilia, being stricken with Love, without the Know∣ledge, either of her Bother, or the States, was marryed; and this she did, as believing or hoping; tht their Pardon would be sooner obtained for such an Action, than their Consent. This Lady, hitherto unspotted from the Evil, or any of the Germane Manners, was allured by the Speeches and Coun∣tenance of Emanuel, who was no unskilled under the Simi∣litudes of Obsequiouness, to find means no raise Pity, espe∣cially because being a young man, and of Royal Birh, he was by Force and Injury driven from his Paternal Intance; for he boasted Don Antonio for his Father, who for a while was King of Portugal. This man with his Brother Christopher, ha∣ving wandred though France, England, and all other places in Hostility with King Philip, seeing the young Lady, and conversing with her as oft as he pleased, (which Liberty is granted by Custom, and remains as the onely Relique of Antient Simplicity, since it self was lost) he assumed the hoped of Affinity, with the Nassuian Family, although be∣sides the inequality of his Fortune, there was a discrpancy in the Religion, which they oth professed from their Fa∣ther. At first therefore, this new Bride and Bridegroom are forbidden the Princes presence; and thereupon, for asswag∣ing his Anger, they retired to Wesel from whence, returning into Holland, with their small Revenue, they lived after the manner of private persons: This was so much the more grie∣vous to her, being the Prince of Aurange's Daughter, and Niece to the Duke, of Saxony; because, both before, and also at the same time, she had Sisters, of the Bourbonian Bloud by the Mothers side, that by the Authority of the State, who gave them Portions out of the Publike-Stock lived like Princes in great state, and with a noble Retinue; for Ludovica Juli∣an was marryed to the Prince Palatine, one of the Electors of
the Empire; Isabella to Henry Duke of Bulloyne; and Catha∣rina, surnamed Belgica, to Philip Count of Harcovia, a Per∣son of no small Wealth among the Franks: But Carola, to whom the Brabanders would have that Name given, was be∣stow'd upon Claudius, of the Family of Tremoyle, Duke of Tuart in Poictou, a man of eminent power; for whose Mar∣riage sake, Henry Frederick obtained to have an Embassage from the States, as well to see the manners of France with his Mother, as the King. The Winter this year proved dangerous to Holland, on that side towards the North, by breaking down the Banks, and causing great Inundations; the like whereof hapned also about Grogen; And the frequent breaking out of Fires in Amsterdam, made them there have suspition of Treachereous dealing from the Enemy. With the Arch-Duke there was such a scarcity of Money, that the Souldiers began to mutiny in every place; for beginning at first in Gelders, the Example passed to Wachtendone, and thence soon after to Calais, Cm∣bray, Ardres, Capelle, Chasteet, Lire, Dorsan, Sclya, S∣um, and Gaunt, which were all infected with the same Con∣tagion: In some places, they thrust out their Captains: in other places, the Officers joyned voluntarily with the Soul∣diers; and when a little money was procured, and sent to some of them that was but a provocation of others, that had none, to the like or greater Disorders; chusing rather the Re∣wards of a Licentious Sedition, than the empty Honour of an unprofitable Obedience: Hereupon several Cities refu∣sed to receive Garisons; And the Arch-Duke himself, with his Retinue, was shut out of Venloo, and all the rest of the Winter was spent in divers contrivances, relating both to Bea and War, even until the beginning of the following Year  Some Traytors also were hired, to bring the Spaniards into the Isle of Tolen; but they exiated their impious and un∣happy Designs with the loss of their Lives; And again ano∣ther while, a Party was sent to take the strong Hold of Bar∣ghen-op-Zoom
by force, while yet the Fortifications were im∣perfect; and, at the same time, another select Band, to force the Gate of Gertruydenberg; but both of them being discover'd by Scouts, were forced to depart without attempt∣ing any thing. About this time, all Things seemed to incline towards Peace; for Philip himself being wearyed out, both of his Courage and Forces, by a Forreign War with France, a Na∣val War with England, and as it were a Civil War in the Ne∣therlands; and learning by Example, That many times Hopes are destroyed by Hopes, or that the hasty Steps of Old Age and Diseases, wherewith he was now broken had inclined him to more wild and moderate Counsels, he desired to hide his Arms, or to distract and break the new-made Society of his Enemies. And the Opinion of most was that he chiefly aimed to rid himself of the French and Dutch Wars, that so he might the more rea∣dily revenge himself upon England and with the less charge; for, in France the loss of Aiens and in the Netherlands, of several Cities beyond the Rhine, had much increased his Ene∣mies Forces, and lessned his own: besides the Country was wasted, his Credit exhausted, from whence grew Seditions, it being impossible to keep a setled and strict Discipline, where the Souldiers want their Pay; and if any part of the Soul∣diery be sent away, while the Enemy hovers up and down, it is very dangerous, because both the Cities of the Netherlands, and the Nobility, are for their forepassed Acts as much suspe∣cted as any: In the mean while among the Hollanders, the Country is secure, and the Sea open, which daily yields much profit, and still promiseth more: And to this purpose, certain Letters written by Albertus to the King, and intercepted, spoke. It pleased him therefore to begin with the French King, because under the pretence of the same Religion, that seem'd both more feazible and convenient; especially since Pope Clement had often admonish'd him, That, since the Family of
Bourbon was receiv'd into the Romane Church, he should in∣cease to trouble him. And if he yet did proceed further, that his former Wars would seem to have been made more out of Ambition, and the Thirst of Empire, than his Care of Reli∣gion or Piety: Adding moreover, all that could be said for the advancement of Concord among Christians, and promo∣ting the War against the Turks. But Philip along time con∣temned all these Warnings; though now at last he began to approve thereof; but chiefly, when he saw the profuse Lar∣gesses towards the French, and that his Armies sent against them were destroy'd; that what he hoped for was vanish'd, and his hopes punish'd with so much severity, that he was thrown out of the possession of much which his Grand-Fa∣thers enjoy'd. Nor was it displeasing to King Henry to re∣cover his own, that he might once enjoy in peace that King∣dom which he had obtained by War; and that he might settle by good Laws all those Things, which for the space of forty years had been corrupted and run to Ruine: And this way moved also all the Catholikes, formerly a Faction onely averse to him, but now the chief men in favour. More over,  all places as he passed, there still met him Crowds of poor People, humbly supplicating him to hearken to Peace. The honour of counselling and advising these two Kings, fell to Alexander Medices the Popes egate, and Bonaventure Cala∣tagiron a Sicilian, the Chief of all the Order of Francistans, who omitted not to shew to the French King, That among the Allies of War, the Reward of it always came to his Lot that first laid hold of Peace: Yet for all these perswasions be would not hearken to a Treaty, until he had Assurance given him That the Articles of the Peace should be such, that he might thereby not onely claim but enjoy the whole Kingdom of France. Fraught with this hope, the Mounsieur's Belleur and Bru∣larde, from the French King, and Mendosa Taxis, Richard and Mariensarde from Alterius, to whom King Philip had given full power concerning this Peace, met at St. Quintins,
where they proceeded in a very procrastinating manner. In the mean while Henry, that he might not seem irreligiously to break the League with England, sends thither his Embassa∣dor, to declare, That by this slow kind of fighting, France did not, us formerly, decay, but die; That all the Noble Families were exhausted by the War, the People brought to Poverty, the Towns lay wasted and burnt, and the Fields unmanured, which must needs yield to the King a sad Spectacle of Misery; And the Extremi∣ty of all these Evils was aggravated by this, That they wanted Remedy: Wherefore, unless he were furnished with an Army spee∣dily at the Charge of his Allies, so as he might therewith, even at once, put an end to the War, What should he do, when even they fought Peace, who must thereby lose the Reward ef their Arms and Valour? however, he would endeavour, that whatever Peace e made, both the Queen and the rest of his Allies, should have equal benefit thereof; but if they should not think fit thereof, yet it with no wonder, if he dealt one way with those who sought Prey and Safety from War, and another with such, as sought nothing but certain Ruine. And that Queen Elizabeth might have the less to accuse the King's Infidelity, this was added, That by the League she had promised to send him 4000 Auxiliaries, but  of ae by the guilt of some few Persons, he was fain to be con∣ with 2000. and those also in a manner extorted from her; At which the King of France had suffered while he desired to retain the Noise of her fruitless Alliance, yet could not forget the Injury against the Hollanders: He had no such plausible Pretence, however he sent Mounsieur Buzanvale, to let them know, what small helps he had either from their Promises or Per∣formances, and that they had received and carryed more out of France by Pay, than they expended by th Charges of their As∣sistance. Both these People were sensible of the King's Arts in this Management of his Affairs, that he was weary of the War, though he would not seem so. But Queen Elizabeth calling
to memory the great Charges she had been at, in behalf of the Hollanders; and considering Ireland, which although at that time infested by Rebels, though indeed their strength was broken; yet detained there John Norris, and Thomas Borrage, formerly famous Captains in the Low-Countries, and there also emulous of each other, had destroyed the Re∣bels by War indeed, but not by fighting, Upon these Consi∣derations therefore, the Queen reurned this Answer; That as she had not been wanting to her Ally, while he proceeded in the War, so if Peace were made, she would willingly be present at the hearing of the Conditions. Onely the Hollanders easily percei∣ved, that they were the persons, that were by Peace to be distinguished, from those against whom a common War was to be waged: For, between the Kings this was one certain Rule leading to Peace: For the future, to abstain from d any further, Injuries and both to give and take Indempnity for al former Actions: Besides, they well knew, that if a man un∣dertake to reconcile a Prince and People, he will find, that the one must enjoy his Will in all Things: and the other must suffer for the Offences of both: Whereupon they were not ignorant, how hard a Task they should undergo, if the whole strength of Spain were turned against them, they thought fit to hint both at the Force and Fraud of their E∣nemies, thereby to deter others, yet themselves politikely to offer any thing: And as to the King of France, who was now advancing against Nants, besides the Regiments of the League, they offer'd as many ships as he would towards the shutting up of the Loyre, and greater ds then all that, if any of the Netherlanders should invade the Borders of France, But behold, as a prevention of all these intended Designs, they themselves are attempted by new Allurements, viz. King Philip had two Daughters, the younger was marryed to the Duke of Savoy; the Elder named Izabella▪Clara-Eugenia be had kept at Home, thereby the better to insnare and Tanta∣lize
many with the hopes of so great a Marriage: For the truth is, she was looked after by the late Emperour Rudol∣phus, Eruestus, and the Duke of Guise, (though this last had spent the principal part of his Age in an unfruitful Coelibate) but now at length is betrothed to the Arch-Duke Albertus of Austria, not without the heavy displeasure of Rudolphus the Emperour, as many reported, that the honour of marrying with her should be refused to him, having formerly so ear∣nestly sought after it. But Philip not minding that, proceeded to the New Mar∣riage, promising in Dowry with her, Burgundy with the Ne∣therlands, not onely that by this division, the right Heir msght be provided for against her younger Brother; but also for the reconciling and winning the Affections of such as had Rebelled, if perhaps the Name of Austria should be more acceptable to them, than that of Spain, whose fresh Injuries would make the others former Benefits be remembred and well resented. But all these Endeavours vere vain, and to no purpose, with People, who would neither be perswaded out of their Fear or Liberty, but weighing all the Necessaries and Pre∣tences of that House, who even by force usurped the Name of the Balgick Empire, they suspected every Thing proceeding from thence: But the Netherlanders of the other part, return∣ed Answers fit for the time, to the Letters Philip had sent them; wherein was transmitted what he had determined, to this purpose. That it was much against thair wills, that they should be dis∣united in their Obedience from the King, of whose Justice and Clemency they had had so many Examples, unless that it should be taken as a part of their Duty, that at their Prince's Com∣mand, they would acknowledge his true Effigies: Thence they fell into Eulogies of their New Lords, highly extolling the vertues of him who was present among them, as daily seen;
and no less admiring those of Her who was absent, which they had but heard of; humbly begging one thing, That he would not withdraw his Assistance from them now, when their Affairs were in a manner desperate; That as to his Care of Re∣ligion, and his Commiseration, his Fame was celebrated even in the most remote Nations, who had been obliged to him for many Bene∣fits: How much more justly then should they esteem his Good∣ness, who had advised with his most Noble Daughter, his most generous Kinsman and them his antient Subjects against that end∣less Calamity, wherewith they are threatned on one side by the Enemy; on the other, by their own Souldiers, no loss grievous than an Enemy? And if they might continue fixed to himself, and his Son and Heir, the Netherlanders would refuse nothing, to shew they hre an Honourable Reverence to the same Majesty, under what Na soever. The Brabanders, but chiefly they of Flanders, did separately urge and insist, That some means might be found of making Peace with the Hollanders but if He would seek, from their Obstinacy to heighten their Punishment, he must thn seek to win some Princes of the Old Religion, and likewise some Ecclesiastical Persons, to be willing, either by Arms or some other help; to give Assistance to the common Cause; for even they that hitherto have feared the dreadful Greatness of Spain, will think themselves much more equal to it when they shall see that Power divided. But all these Things, as they were intermingled with Truth and Falshood, the Sequel of the History, wherein I shall proceed in the next Book, will make manifest.
The Seventh BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1598.THE Ʋnited States did not delay to adde new Signs of their old Hatred to their Enemy; for they set forth an Edict, That nothing that was fit, either for War or Shipping, should be transported either into Spain, or any Peo∣ple allyed to them; and thereupon followed another, whereby a Restraint was laid upon all Home-growing Fruits, least while they sought for advantage abroad, they should breed a scarcity at Home; but Hostile Flanders was forbidden of all sort of Trade: Among which Passages, the French Peace, that had never been well observed, disappointed such as greedily sought after Advantage, and dealt in Matters of that Nature, by abating the Custom, and using other Crafty Po∣licies. Now also, Counsels began to be taken concerning new Arming the Militia, as well such as were to be Lanceers, as those who had either in the Infantry or Cavalry deserved well by their Experience, and use of greater and lesser Guns: Besides, new Troops were gather'd, with the Revenues which had been raised out of the Fields the last Autumn. But after∣wards, when they began to search into the Frauds and false Dealings of the Captains, they found by Experience, that all their great Noise of Remedies fell short, and that it little profited to reduce the Numbers of every Company, so long as the same means of Deceit remained, whereby the more their Numbers were lessned, the more pernitiously they ga∣ped to devour what was possible.
Moreover, the most active and vliant Souldiers of that chaffering Age, whom the Captains used to invite over with the hopes of greater Rewards and Pay than they had before, were now onely equalled to the rest, by this contracted Li∣centiousness of Defrauding, although themselves with infi∣nite Greediness sucked dry the Common Treasury for those uses: From hence began frequent running away, even to the spoiling of whole Regiments; and certainly, the Mischief would have increased, had it not been stopped by the Ene∣mies Poverty: Which Things being perceived at length, by the Prince's daily Admonition, the States acknowledged; the Evils were grown too big for them. In this mean while, there was a secure Quiet beyond the Rhine, which made all the Provinces of the Union, as their Tributes increased, to consider of a way to gratifie their Go∣vernours Prince Maurice, and Count William, either with the Rewards of Lands or Money; though there wanted not some, who would have blasted this Testimony of their grateful Minds, with the ignominious Name of an Ambitious Prodi∣gality. About this time, being the second Moneth of the Year, hapned a more rare than admirable Thing hereabouts, which because real Prodigies were not sufficient, was reputed in the account of an Ostent. A kind of Whale was found up∣on the Coast of Holland by certain Fisher-men, and drawn ashore by them with Ropes; which is a Creature not so much unknown, but that many of our Countrey-men that live by the Sea-side are well acquainted both with its Name and Shape: The place where it was taken is called Bercheyde, be∣tween Schevelin and Catwick, an old Village, drawing its Original from the Catt, as the Name testifies: from whence, not far off, is a Passage into the middle Channel of the Rhine, and a Castle, which is now utterly ruin'd by the Incroach∣ments of the Sea, the Ruines whereof may sometimes be seen at a Low Water: This Castle is said to be one of the Works
of Drusus, or rather of Severus, to whom our Ancestors, by reason of its standing opposite to Brittain, gave the Name of Arx Brittanica. But to return to the Whale, which reached Seventy Foot in length, filling all the Shore between the Sea and the Sand-hills; to the sight whereof, went a vast multi∣tude of People, not minding the filthy and nausious Savour thereof; for after it was dead upon the Land, as it lay the Bowels burst our, which so infected the Air thereabout, that many of those that went to see it, were cast into Diseases by the stench of it, and some dyed: Certainly, to Wise-men nothing could seem less wonderful, than one such Creature, whereof the vast Ocean contains a Multitude in her im∣mense Profundities, cast upon the Shallows by Winter∣Storms, where at the Ebbe of the Tide, it could not get off, but discover'd it self by the vain strugling, and beaing of her great Body upon the Flats: But among the Vulgar, who have liberty to interpret all Things according to their own Fancy, and to draw all the Works either of Nature or Chance into Parties, and from thence to fore-tell to the Hollanders, who were the Conquerors of that Creature, rich Spoils, and the Vi∣ctory over their Enemies: Others, from hence, denounce sad and unlucky Omens to them, who are follow'd by such Monsters in their own Seas: Which Things also being ban∣died backward and forward in Books, the Year following manifestly convicted of Vanity; being a Year of Idleness, if compared with some that went before. Nay, though some, from the Event, would seem with Reason to conclude, from the taking of a Sea-Calf in the River, not far from Gor∣richen, not long after, that these Creatures were the Fore-run∣ners of those Actions, which in after-times were transacted near those Places. This indeed is true, that seldom in any Year have more Things hapned, contrary both to Hope and Expectation, the very beginning thereof, from the Winter go∣ing all along with unsuccessful Endeavours: For the Com∣manders
of the Garison of Berghen-op-Zoom being perswa∣ded, that by an agreed Connivence of the Scouts, they might get Wonde, which is a Castle scituate inward; from whence some of the King's Souldiers being sent out into the Estua∣ries, did infest all the Rivers; the Setter forward of this De∣sign, being a man no less timorous than imprudent; as soon as the Danger began to appear, himself by his own flight, spoil'd the Plot which had been laid by his counsel. But Prince Maurice suffer'd a greater Mishap with the Fleet sayling into Flanders, without the fault or neglect of any man; for the Winds raging without intermission, quite destroy'd such ships as lay abroad, while the rest, not without great hazard, sought to get into Harbour: And by chance it hapned, that some few days after, a Castle or Fort of the same Coast, that lyes opposite to Bierfleet beyond Zealand, was by some Gar∣rison French Souldiers deliver'd to the Spaniards, who bought it of them, the Third Year after it had bin in the hands of the Hollanders, by the Treachery of some Waloon Soul∣diers; and in this manner was both the shame and loss re∣compensed. A Party of Horse also marched towards Limburg, cover∣ing to intercept some Companies of Foot lying thereabouts; but their Journey being discover'd, they were forced to re∣turn Home empty through the deep Snow. The same in the Dutchy of Juillers, by the surprize of some Troops, about Burick, were forced to leave some Provisions to the Enemy, which they had intercepted, though not without the loss of some bloud. And others returning from Leige and Trevier, were met by the Enemy and worsted: Which trivial, but frequent Mischances, in some measure, diminished the Ho∣nour they had gotten the former Year, in the action of Turn∣hnt. In the interim, the Hollanders neither lost the good that comes by Peace, nor those Advantages which in other Wars were unknown: Nay, they made good use of the Dis∣cord
that fell out between the English and Germans; the be∣ginning of which Contention, when, in the Event, it reached the Low-Countries. I must begin at a greater distance. In former Times, the chief Trade for Merchants was set∣led in the German Cities; of which they that were scituate, either by the Sea, or some famous Rivers, to the Number of Seventy, were by the just Laws of Commerce incorporated into one Body, but consisting of divers Nations; as the Vene∣dians, Saxons, Borussians, and Westfalians, who were all united by one League, which was named the Ansiatike League: Nor were the Superior Northerly Parts, and the Netherlandish Parts, onely frequented by the Industry of the Germans, but also London it self was a great Mart for them; where, after they had publikely flourished for their Fidelity and Profit in Trading, it was granted by the Kings of England, that they might barter or exchange their Commodities, paying but small Customs: But at that time, the Pastures of Brittains, with the onely proceed of their Wooll, did almost answer all Importations from Foreign Parts, although nothing was then fetched out of the Island, but rough Wooll in the Fleece; until the Netherlanders, weary of their Domestick Evils, and for diverse uses, being banish'd out of their own Countries, as they taught some People in other Things, so they instru∣cted the English, in ordering and working of their Wooll. This hapned during the Reign of King Edward, who mind∣ing to draw some part of this new Gain into his own Trea∣sury, thought himself hindred in his intent by the Ansiatike League: Wherefore, seeking some cause of Quarrel, where∣by he might recede from what his Predessors had granted, the English begin to turn all Topsie-Turvey, yet still to offer the Germans their old Priviledges, if they would undergo the Customs and Burdens laid upon Cloathing; with the same readi∣ness and obedience, as the Citizens and Subjects of the Kingdom did; averting, That nothing was so contrary to the Duty of
Prince, as to release that Burden to Strangers, which the Subjects were forced to bear; and therefore required, that they might enjoy the like Immunities through Germany. All which pre∣vailed nothing with the Germans; who retorted, That by these new Inventions, the Priviledges which they had purchased with three hundred years Merits, and had been confirmed unto them by the Oaths of fourteen Kings, were utterly infringed. And no less were they proved at the new setled Company of the English, who took away all their Gain, by serving other Na∣tions with their Cloth. Hence arose. Envy and Complaints to the Emperour, especially at that time, when by reason of the Quarrels between Queen Elizabeth, and the Duke of Alva, the English being commanded out of the Netherlands, had setled beyond the Feines: They were accused for spoil∣ing and undervaluing the Commodity in the Manufacture, by discovery of the Prices at the first hand: In this manner much time was spent, partly in Wranglings between the Sub∣jects, and partly in Letters of Princes, sent to and fro, untill the English Name, growing more and more hated, by conti∣nual Pyracies at Se, Philip, the Inciter of such Feuds, re∣newed these old Controversies, undertaking the Deferce of the Cause with Caesar by his Ministers Mendosa and Clement, not with any Affection to the Ansiatike League, but that he might ri up old Sores, and disturb the Sea with an Enemy. Now also Lubeck, the Head City of the League, in an Embassie by them sent, (at which time the Authority of the King of Denmark was ought after, for the working upon the Hollanders, of which Embassie. Plous Barlayment was the Chief) blamed the Germans; wh passing by all the rest of the Neherlanders, only endeavor'd, by their Commerce, to increase the Wealh of Rebels; which shewed, that they bore neither an honest, nor grateful Mind, for such a good Office of the King: And now they were daily sollicited to take Arms against the English, with Promises of great Assist∣ance
to them therein: And thereupon the Germans sent these Demands to the Cities, formerly of the Ansiatike, but now of the Belgike League, with Letters discovering Hatred, either out of Envy against that People, growing potent by Merchandize; or else, because it hath been found true by frequent Experiments, that the nearer men agree in Religi∣on, the more sharply they differ; for they of the Augustane Confession, and the Catholikes, the more different they are in Judgment, the more concurrent they are in Affection. These Things were all done the former Year; wherein, at last, by the Decree of the Emperour Rudolphus, the English, that exercised the Manufactories of Cloth, within the Bounds of the Germane Empire, were commanded by a certain Day to depart: Nor did the Queen indulge much longer time to the Ansiatikes in England; And it was in vain to begin Treaties, in regard there could be no convenient Meetings, for the English departing from Stoad, which was the chief Seat for their Trading, from thence all sort of Traffick and Negotiating Factories were translated to Bruges, (though it had been sometime at Antwerp) and from thence again, it was forced to remove by the miseries of the War; and then the Merchants, for the betrer chusing of themselves a convenient station, the War being now carryed away to the Borders, they compassed and tryed most of the Cities of Holland, who were in Trading, as in the midst of a feled Peace; by whose Emulation, and contending who should excel most, in rich Presents to them, they were divided in Opinions: But at last complaining, that the Waters, in many places, were not good for the washing of their Wools, they setled at Middleburg in Walchren; from whence also, part of the same Body again had formerly gone away, when the Affairs of Antwerp were in a distracted Condition, as well by a Siege, as by Fear. The States, for the inviting of Society and Commerce, answer'd all Things to the Desires
of their Suitors, as knowing, that their Company would ad∣vance both their Stock and Tributes. Much time was spent, in contriving Covenants between the English and Germans: In the interim, the Hollanders, whom they of Flanders not long before forced Home, having gotten the Manufactory of Cloth to Leyden and Harlem, by the same mightily increased those places, making to them∣selves an advantage from other mens harms; yea, and seve∣ral Renegadoes of Portugal, part of which were the Remain∣ders of the Jews in that Kingdom, that they might be free from question, for professing the Religion of their Country; and also out of hope of greater Gain, much advanced the bigness and Trade of Amsterdam; and their Navigation at Sea, by how much they were more subject to danger in Spain, by so much they spread themselve far and wide into other parts of the World: One Wind brought out of the Baltike Sea one hundred and fifty ships all laden with Corn, which by the Covetousness of the Merchants, was either so kept up, or dispersed into Forreign Parts, that the Price of Corn was no whit abated thereby; and this was reckoned among the Advantages of the Common wealth, not onely for the Gain it brought from abroad, but because Necessity had reduced Matters to that pass, that any one could live more easily, than he that Tiled the Ground. They went also by other Seas towards Constantinople, and the Ports of Syria and Egypt, and the Islands in the Egeau Seas, under the Name and Protection of English, or French Traders: In all which places, they passed backward and forward with safety. But yet they could not avoid, but that they might be inter∣cepted, either by the Spaniard, or if they escaped him, they might fall upon the Coasts of Barbary, or meet a Turkish Gal∣ley: by all which, being Enemies to one another, they were sure to be seized and taken as Enemies: And in all these Cases, the Danger was more grievous; for that the Fortune
and Custom of their War is such, that the smallest of their suffering or punishment, is to pay an excessive Ransom for their Liberty. And certainly, herein the Merchants Avarice is worthily accused, who run their Ships naked, both of Men and Arms, into so great and univoidable Dangers, and yet do not en∣deavour to win some Vindicators of their Rights in those Barbarous Regions, but are glad to fly to the Patronage of them; by joyning with some of whom, the rest become more inraged: For the Hollanders follow'd the French and English, as they formerly did the Venetians; from whence sprung, among Christians, Discords concerning Gain, rather than a Sacred Society, which heir Name obliged them to. The same Spring, and the Summer that follow'd, no less than fourscore Sail of Ships, of great Bulk and Burden, set out for long Voyages; part went to the Golden Shore of Ethiopia; part to the Indies, and the Molluca Islands; and some to America, or that part of the World which is oppo∣site to Us, or to the Streights of Magellan: Questionless, this is no new Thing, to make several Attempts in divers places a once. About this time, one of the Ships of Zeland, which had bin at the Indies upon the English Coast, either by the sticking of the Rudder in a Shelf, or for want of Balast, turning on one side, at all the Port-holes of the Guns, (which by chance were open) took in the Sea, and, on a suddain was over∣whelmed in the Waves, and all her Lading, which consisted most of Silver, together with the men that were in it, were uterly lost. Unfotunate also, and full of Damage, was that audacious Attempt of Balthazar Mucero, who being a Mer∣chant, and revolving in his Mind how to acquire a New Government, because the States and Prince Maurice, had granted him Letters of Mart upon his Request, assayed to take from the Portugezes, and King Philip, a certain Island in the Ethiopick Sea, upon the Bennine Shore, near the Equin∣ctial
Circle; which, although it were not over-fertile, yet it was very convenient for such as passed that way: Two hun∣dred Souldiers and Marriners blown up with Hope, that they should each of them have six hundred Florens Yearly Wa∣ges, took his part. Over these he placed as Commander Ju∣lianus Clerhage a Captain of a restless Nature, and unfaithful to his Country, and its Governours; for, under the Earl of Leicester, he was not so free from Sedition, but that he was accused to have been willing to have had a hand therein. To him were joyn'd other young men of small Fortune: At first, they flatter'd the Islanders and Natives; and, upon pretence of Feasting, upon a private persons words, the chief men of the Island were cunningly allured into the Ships, and there kept, giving to the Portugezes this hope, That they should find the Friendship of Holland more advantagious to them than the Castilian; and promising the Natives a more mode∣rate Servitude. And now by sowing the Land with Seed, and using other Husbandry, they began very successfully to flou∣rish: But the Priest of the Island instigated to Revengeful Arms and Slaughter, all the men, who were of their own re∣cord fearful of Things untryed, and choosing rather their old and known Slavery: Thus their first Instigator, being after∣wards taken and put to death, by a pretence of Law, the Multitude were so exasperated, by his Death and Punish∣ment, that they continually were in Counsel to Rebel; though at the present, they seem'd to crave both Peace and Pardon. But some oher Legates of Mucero were slain by Treachery, not without suspition of Clerhage, as having pur∣posely remove the Watch; and they which remain'd with him, leaving their Care of fortifying themselves, fell to such variance, that they much augmented their Enemies Boldness and Courage to set upon them. At last, Diseases increasing, through the unseasonableness of the Air and Weather, Clerhage, with many others, being dead, the few that remained in health, having no supply of
Victuals, but what their Ships afforded  of Aid, which the Portugezes had sent for to the Neighbouring Islands; and the Continent left carelesly, and, with much do, their new-built Garrison, when, in hope of a growing Colo∣ny, Women as well as Men, Arms and Provisions were sent (though too late) out of Holland, to relieve them. Neither at this time did the English lye still, of whom the Earl of Cumb rland, with Forty Sail of private men ships, beset Lisbone, which was of very great advantage to the Hol∣landers, who, when the Portugezes were shut up, were like by themselves onely, to obtain the whose Trade of the In∣dies: Nor could it be otherwise, as the Enemies themselves ingeniously confessed; for if they durst not not cope with one Fleet of Pirates upon their own Coast, they might for the future, well despair, that they should not  the pos∣session of the Sea under their Dominion: From thence pas∣sing towards America, by the Fortunate Islands, he strook the King's Plae-Fleet into a great fear; and, not long , forcing the Island of Porto-Rico, he got nothing but a little Booty; and so, eiher broken by the Diseases of his Men, or ignorant how to use his Victory, as hath been observed to be the fault of many of that Nation, he departed. But the Hol∣landers suffer'd great Losses in their own Sea, the Enemies frequenting it being onely Pirates, which formerly harbour∣ed at Dunkirk, but now luked in the Narrow Sea near Calais: With which Trouble, the Fisher-men were much perplexed; yet if as any time, they perceived themselves equal in strength, they blamed their Sea-Captains, for avoid∣ing to meet the Pyrates; for tht since they could not enjoy their safety, they would fight with them to the Death, for Honour and Revenge: Against this lvl, many Remedies were sought after: And some there were that believed, that our great Ships would have been sunk in the Enemies Har∣bours; but the Force of the Winds and Waves, helped by
the Labour of Men, in some manner, saved them, though by reason of their great Bulks the danger was the greater. Wherefore the number of these ships being increased by some that were new built, they were sent to keep Guard upon the Enemies Coasts, to secure the Enemy from coming out, and be a Convoy and Safeguard to other Vessels that were unarmed: Other part of them were commanded to scour their lurking places, and to clear the Sea, by running backward and forward cross-wise: And; the Guard of the Narrow Sea was committed to Peter Douse, who had under his Command an indifferent Fleet. The chief Care of the States was, that as the War increa∣sed upon them, proportionably to augment the Revenue that was to maintain them against it, which was submitted to by the Common People, sensible of their danger, with much modesty: Onely in Utrecht, the giddy-headed Multitude, with great Fury, withstood these New Taxes, as long as the Revenues of the Church, which the other Provinces had con∣verted to the publike Use, were detained in private hands. At the beginning of Christianity, and afterwards as Affe∣ction thereto increased, every famous City did collect the Products of Religious Charity, wherewith the Convents of Men and Holy Women, separated by divers Names to the Service of God, maintain'd themselves in their Pious Re∣cess; which being conveyed from hand to hand, for the ease of Posterity, long since grew into an Antient Custom: But the very Face of Religion being alter'd by these Wars, they have now not so much as the Shadow, while partly Youth brought up in Learning, takes the Monastike fe upon him as a Pleasure; and partly while every sluggish and idle Drone, either for Favour or Money, obtaining the same, in∣finitely abuseth it, by his Lascivious Life, disorderly Car∣riage, and supersluous Pampring: And yet these same, by the Name of Ecclesiasticks, both in the Senate which Com∣mands,
and among the Judges that put the Law in Executi∣on, are the first who give their Opinion; and that by the same Right, as the whole Nobility, and the third Estate; the one part of them is drawn out of the Cities, and the other out of the Towns. Scarce could the Authority of the United States, or the Prince, abate the Rage of the Commons, against these Things, though the Example thereof began to be dreadful, and might prove a matter of evil Consequence, yet at last they reduced them to Order: In the mean while Philip ha∣ving setled his Affairs, as to matter of Money, as well as he could, together with the Threats of War, he used Invitations and Allurements to advance Peace: And because in the Ne∣therlands, there were as well Souldiers wanting as Money; and that, besides the new raised men, his chief Confidence was in the Spaniards, who lay about the Borders of the Coun∣try: He set Sail from Calais with 38 Ships laden with men being part of that Fleet, which we formerly related to have been driven by Tempest from the English Coasts, wher they last attempted to invade that Kingdom. In this Fleet were four Regiments consisting of so many Thousand Men, of which Sancius Leva, the Commander in chief of the Fleet had the Charge: He, with a prosperous; Gale, and the steerage of a Renegado Hollander, brought most of them safe to Harbour, while a contrary Wind and Tempest had beaten back the Hollanders, that were to guard those narrow parts of the Sea: But the Spaniards, with all their Labour, were scarcely gotten within the Port before they ran a ground: For so they were commanded, that if any considerable strength of the Enemy appear'd at Sea, they should be sure to land the Souldiers, though by that means they should be forced to lose their ships: yet notwithstanding all his their hast, one ship fell into the Hollanders hands; wherein, con∣trary to the Custom of a Maratime War, the Captives had all their Lives spared; and the Reason was, Because the first
Heat being passed in Consultation, it would have seem'd very inhumane to have kill'd them in cool Bloud: But they which passed by, part of them by the Advice of the Ger∣manes and Danes, went out upon their Shores; & others being taken up by the Spaniard, by the Hollanders consent, had leave to pass the Sea quietly Home; the rest were to be re∣furnish'd with Men and Arms, and with a greater Fleet, which was to be built and rigged up in Spain, they were, by Report, to begin a new War at Sea; because, within a few days, Calais was to be deliver'd up to the French King. Not long after, two ships, hoping to take a Voyage privi∣ly into Spain, fell into the Hollanders hands, being full of rich Merchandize, and well manned with Souldiers, who having had enough of War, and gotten therein sufficient Wealth, were there returning to their Country to take their ease: There were in it also take a Letters, wherein were dis∣cover'd the Intentions and Gifts of the Cities, destined and alloted to Fontain, which Prince Maurice sent back to him. The coming of the Spanish Souldiers was every where dis∣pleasing to the Common People, as well for the Hatred of their Persons▪ a of War: But the Arch-Duke glad of them, their Poverty having, by the sense or fear of Evil, over∣come all Difficulties, by their Aid, and the service of Her∣man Count Heremberg put an end to that long-continued Se∣dition of the Souldiers at Grave for want of their Pay; al∣though some Prisoners and Letters also did certifie, that though they were pacified more were offended, that among all these Turnings, would yet remain faithful to their Par∣ties: This was the state of the Law Countries on both sides, before the state of Affairs was thee anew changed. At this time, between the Embassadors of France, and the Arch-Duke Albertus, the long-continued Treaty, pro∣duced great hopes of Peace; and the Queen of England had sent thither Cecil, Son to the Lord Burghly, and with him one
Wilks, who was privy to all his Secrets: And therefore now the matter it self required, that the Ʋnited States should send Embassadors to France; and Queen Elizabeth desiring, that they might be authorized with a full and free power, toge∣ther with her Embassadors, to Treat of War and Peace; They disapproved the Motion, lest afterwards, if they de∣nyed to consent, they should be over-powred by her Royall Authority. Hereupon a double Embassie is appointed with a conve∣nient Retinue; one of which was to go into England. The Persons were, the Lords Warmnde, often before-mention'd, and beloved by the English, in remembrance of his good ser∣vice in the Cadiz Expedition; Min Heer Heffingen a Frizon, and John Wercken of Zeland. To France they sent Justine Nassau, Governour of the Sea for Zeland, and John Olden-Barnevlt, principal Counsellor and Assistant to the States of Holland, a man well skill'd and industrious for the publike good of his Country, and by his Authority did, and obtain'd is much as by the help of Art, Wit, and Industry could be done, or obtain'd among a free People: And here, among many other things which I have cause to fear, this is one, lest any strangers, into whose hands these Histories shall come, should wonder, how the Names of such famous men, an ho∣nourable Report of whom they have receiv'd in their own Country, should come to be so seldom mention'd in my Writings: But I hope the great difference between the Go∣vernment of that State, and the Empire of other Countries, shall be a sufficient Excuse for me. For where the Actions of Cities and Towns are related, which are ruled either by the Senate or People, if any more eminent matter of Valour o Policy happen, there is given a fair occasion meerly in a return of Gatince, to set out the Authors or Inventors thereof: Neither in Kingdoms do the great Ministers of
State remain obscure. But, among the Hollanders, all things are transacted in the Name of the Council, without any mention of the Authors; whom, although you know, yet you would seem ambitious, in seeking to praise them; nor would you avoid the hared and displeasure of many, by whom anothers Glory is look'd upon as their shame, and the praise of their active Honour, as a Reproof of their slug∣gish and dull Nature. The Embassadors that went to England, endeavour'd by many Arguments to make the Queen averse to a Pacifica∣tion; advising also, That she would, in some measure, grati∣fie the French King, in his desire concerning Aid; and then urge him further, being incouraged by Embassadors, that he would, of his own accord, rather seek Reparation both for Old and New, former and later Injuries by War, than to think to appear his Domestick Discords against such a rest∣less Nation: And then bowing the Knee, according to the Customs of the Court, when they had returned large Thanks for so mer Benefits, They added in these words: All who are called fom their just Arms, to talk of Peace, ought to consider, whther the Peace that is offer'd be reall and sound, or deceitful and infirm and, on the other side, whether the War be terrible or dubious, or be not moe safe than Peace; for it is a vain thing to talk of the goodness of Peace▪ where men shall never be suffer'd to enjoy it: The Spniard, O Queen, is report∣ed to sollicite you to a Peace, whose perfidy Conunct with Barba∣rous Cruelty, and whose Ambition of reaching at the Rights of others, we need not accuse. when his Masters openly teach, that with men differing from them in point of Religion, no Faith or Promise is to be kept, neither ought they to partake of the Benefit either of Divine or Humane Laws: Others have not fear'd to say, that by the Decree of Fate, the highth of Empire is allotted to the West; and that, amng Christians, there shall be no other visible Empire on Earth, than that of Spain. And though it
might be to purpose, to speak of the impotent Pride of the Austri∣an Family to other Princes, and how, by Trisling Leagues, it hath claimed to it self that Angle as Hereditary, with other the furthest Parts of the Earth, that whatever lies within the Bounds of Lutope, if it be not his own, is accounted and looked upon as an Enemy; yet it will be to little purpose, to remember these things to you, which have suffer'd and undergone many Hazards by him. And can it be doubted, but that he still hath the same Mind, who hath not onely armed the People of your Kingdom to Rebellion, and more than once sought to invade it by Fleets, (though prevented by Almighty God) but also, so far contemned all Honesty and Justice, that he hath precured Murderers and Poysoners to do mischief to your Sacred Person: Certainly, it is not to be doubted, for the old Grudges, and the Causes thereof re∣main; and as you continue fixed in your antient Piety, so is he no∣thing alter'd from his wonted Avarice. And now this man seems to seek to make an honourable Peace with you, with a just and pious intent is it not that he may wage his Wars at his own plea∣sure, while now he is forced to wait upon yours? And therefore, he presuming, from the present Affairs, to gain opportunity for greater Matters, will lie in wait for all occasions. And shall we, in so great danger, be caught and wrapt up into a stuggish secu∣rity; We know, that since he cannot catch us all, he endeavours by this League (which he surely intends to break) to ose as many of us as he can: Former Kings and People did better; for though they were not at all troubled, yet they never fear'd to ioyn toge∣ther against increasing Empires while they had time, lest at one time or other, though piece-meal, they might be all conquer'd. For they knew, that some Wars were waged onely to obtain Peace: O∣thers because a safe Peace could never be obtained: And as the Nature of Fire and Water are directly contrary and endless, so is the Contention of them that on the one hand sek to domineer over all, and of those, on the other side, that will serve none: wherein to seek Revenge or Defence too late is folly; but to anticipate  very beginnings is a glorious act befitting wise men: For it is not so
much for the punishing of Injuries, as for preventing Princes of that sort of Dominion, which is nicknamed to be Power given them by Heaven. He cannot be said to preserve himself, that lies upon the Defensive Posture: 'Tis Impunity makes wicked Minds worse: Let Philip's Pretences be what they will, 'tis sure he will always keep Armies a foot both by Sea and Land; What to do? To fight with the Turk, or keep other Fo∣rein Enemies in awe? No, no, but to bring Us under his Yoke, or otherwise to o with Us what Providence will suf∣fer him. Nor can England be free either from Charge or Fear, while his Armis are raging every where. Let but this Question be answer'd, Whether is an Act of greater Va∣lour to be afraid of, or fight with an Enemy? and whether is it more just and honourable, to take Tributes from our Sub∣jects, or Booties from our Foes? We do not boast, Great Queen, our Alliance with you; We acknowledge our selves ob∣liged to you for infinite Benefits; which, that they may not be for∣gotten or lst, a little concerns you, but us highly, who both would be, and be accounted grateful, And if We, on our part, have done ought in requital, which might be acceptable for the readi∣ness of our Intents, in regard the multiplicity of our pressing Ne∣cessities could not grant more, We doubt not but You will be ready to remember it with more Equity, than behoves us to speak of it. This is without all Dispute, that your Ancestors have had such an Esteem of the Belgick Provinces, in regard of their Site and Customs, that they always thought it a matter of great moment, in all their great Affairs, to have their Friendship, and of Prejudice to have them Enemies. But herein yon have excel∣led the Glory of your Ancestors, that by how much you exceed others in Power, by so much you excel them in Acts of Mercy and Piety; by whose Means and Aid the French have gain'd many Victories, and We more which will redound to the Honour, not onely of your Self, but those that shall come after you. The future Events of Wars are in the Hands of Almighty God, whom we  found propitious to us, beyond all Humane Expe∣ctation.
And as far as it is lawful for a Wise-man to judge of Futurities, we have all those things, that put Life, and add Si∣news and Strength to War; for we have Men Mneyes, Towns, Cities, and Forts; nay more, we have a General so famously ex∣emplary for Valour and Vertue, that it is hardly to be imagined, how any of these things should decrease, and not rather be aug∣mented: Whereas the Enemy, unless by our giving way, hath not where to settle: And as his Dominion it wider, so is ours more convenient; for in a great and over-spatious Empire, it is usual for some People to Rebel: Upon which occasion, if at any time he be employ'd, it will be easie for other Princes to appoint what Me∣thod they will use for the future for their own Security. That which is usually said, or thought to the contrary, That a man ought not to thrust himself into another Man's Affairs or Business; I will not say it is a hard Speech, against Humanity, against the Honour and Glory of Princes, with whom nothing that is good or great, is less unquestion'd, nor any suffer'd to do good that would: And, where any puts that upon another, that he is not wil∣ling to undergo himself, may it be his Fortune to obtain no other Doom. In this case whatever we speak of our selves, the same may be said of England; for they that, without themselves, would indanger the Hollanders, with an intent onely to save them∣selves, do little consider, that it is alike easie to Fortune, to make an end of them, as for any one to set Bounds to his de∣sires. Will therefore our Ruine add any thing to you, or to your strength? Or will it any whit diminish your Enemies Ambition? Or rather, will not any man think it more truly probable, that if we are devoured, the Danger will not go over to the English, who, as they were not behind us in Wealth, so they are like to be second to us in Misery? Wherefore, what advantage is it to consider, whe∣ther you fight in Holland, or your Country for your own Lands and Territories: You may have us for your Associates, in De∣fence of the Common Weal; and is not that safer, than to have us unwilling Servants, to advance the Spaniards Tyranny?
For if three Nations, which are at this day powerful at Sea, if the Hollanders be joyned to the Spaniards, it is much to be fear∣ed, that England afterward will have a hard Task to cope with them, especially since the Sea and their Navies are the main, if not sole Defences of the Kingdom: Besides, none will be then equal to match Philip in Wealth, if his Revenues out of the new World, and the Indies, since the Conquest of Portugal, till this time in∣fested with War, be once brought to a certain and safe Return. Thus, in fine, his own Forces will be able to accomplish his De∣sires, upon those whom he hath hitherto treated as his Inferiours; and then shall it no longer be lawful for the English to be any where, than now it is lawful for them to be in Germany, from whence he hath driven you by bought Decrees, as profane and guilty persons, and, as much as in him lies, would banish them from all Humane Society and Commerce. But this thing trou∣bleth us, for we hear there are some, who by Clandestine Speeches, object against us the Envy of an ill Example, at if we were guilty of a new Defection: This hath been spoken before Philip; but to gratifie whom, we shall not say, but chose rather not to know them: What hath been done in France and Ireland, merely out of a desire of Innovation, the Hollanders were compelled thereto by a most excusable Necessity; otherwise, with what Confidence durst they have call'd it a Fault, that Kings had approved and assisted them, by Leagues, Writing, and Arms? We seek the good our Grand Fathers enjoyed which is Liberty: Let no man start at that Word, for we believe Liberty to be in a most flourishing con∣dition under a lawful, Principality. We do not yet fear Forreign Powers; and now, if any one will look upon Oppression, and not Names, we shall quickly agree. There is no other or better Tye to keep Subjects in their Obedience, to be used either by you, O Queen, Us, or all Governments, than to teach them this one Rule, That they would be content in their present estate, and not seek change or alteration. Observe also, what a pernitious Ex∣ample he induceth, who, however for Ambition and Dominion
sake, he hath voluntarily submitted himself to the Yoke, com∣mands all Kingdoms to bow to the Pope, and calls not onely the People thereof, whom he hires to Sedition, but the very Kings them∣selves, Rebels: Certainly, to this man there will never be want∣ing, either a cause, or a pretence, for War: but that he may some∣times want hopes, next to God Almighty, it lies, Great Queen, in your Hands; and if you resolve with Us to Conquer, We shall be ready to run the extreamest Hazards for our Social Fidelity; and we hope you will rather maintain your wonted Constancy, than neglect Advantage; and, by the ruine of your Friends, promul∣gate and corroborate the Enemies strength. The Consultations upon this Matter, in the Queen's Court, were various, and both Opinions had strong Sup∣porters; to know whose Behaviour and Affections, will not be from the purpose, that it may appear how the Perswaders Authority bore sway in the Publike Counsels. The Earl of Essex, as we have elsewhere declared, being a young man, and burning with the desire of Glory, was a Li∣beral Giver, beyond the Ability of his Estate, wholly spend∣ing himself in compassing the Love of the Nobles, Com∣mons, and Souldiers, having no hopes in Peace but putting great Confidence in the Friendship of the Hollanders; and therefore, he, being General of all Forces in England, was for the War with Spain; affirming, That it could not be put off, unless at once, both the Queen's Security, Credit, and Charges, should all be hazarded. On the other side, the Lord Burghly from a private Person being called to the Court, and advanced to the high Honour of being Lord Treasurer of England, minding wholly the Care of the Treasury, especi∣ally now in the declining of his Age, and his Parsimony a∣greeing with that of the Queen, being also very rich, and well-grounded in Experience, and so, by his Authority, pre∣ceding the others Favour; This man, with grave Words, praising Christian Concord, debated among all the doubtful
Counsels, what was the most pious and honest to be fol∣low'd; He said, [That a present Commodity ought to be preferr'd before the Incertainties of Suspition, and that Peace would not be more profitable to the Enemy, than to the English; and is the strength of out Countrey so little known, that it cannot be safe, but at the pleasure of the Hol∣lander, when, in the mean time, the French out of common fear, and the Hollanders themselves out of their Care of Re∣ligion, are tyed with stronger Bonds against Danger by Ne∣cessity; than by a League? Besides, the Spaniard is willing to be quiet, out of a sense of his own infirmiy: And then Peace would follow without more ado, both in Ireland, and elsewhere.] Queen Elizabeth either really wavering in her Mind, or else willing to express all other Things by her fear of Peace, made Answer in a very temperate manner. [That from the beginning she had done nothing without the Advice of her Allies; that it was acceptable to her, that they had declared their Minds so freely, yet there were many and great causes, both for her Self, and the French, that moved them to desire an end of the War, and to make her trust to Peace, by remo∣ving or disbanding her Armies; for since the Spaniards old hopes have been crossed, by the Netherlanders abjuring him, the loss of France, and so many other slaughters and mis∣fortunes, if he should think fit to re-assume his Arms, the same God that had helped them before, would, she doubted not, assist them again, to maintain their Right by the Sword; but if they thought fit to continue in Arms, things more cer∣tain ought to be offer'd.] This thing the Peers of England interpreted thus: That there was no Fault more heinous, than to defraud the Queen of her Rights and Duties, some∣times by Cavillings, otherwhiles by deceitful Supplicati∣ons, and Pretences of Poverty, which the Wealth of the Ci∣ties in Holland, and their well-stocked Treasury, openly con∣suted.
Nor was it more to be endured, that the English should lose the Trade of Spain for them, and yet they preferr'd their own Gain, before the famishing of their Enemies, and so make Merchandize of the War. At last, this Delay was put to the Pacification, that Em∣bassadors from both should go to take notice of the French Affairs: And, to that purpose, by the Queen were sent thi∣ther, the before-mentioned Cecil and Wilks, with whom the hopes of Peace was grown dead, by being at the Treaty at St. Quintins; for the Spaniards preferred, by the Name of Allies, those whom the French Peace would advantage, gi∣ving out at last, that they onely should be included in the Treaty, who observed the Romane Rites in point of Religion: The Embassadors from Holland came a little later, by rea∣son of contrary Winds. The King, at this time, was at An∣geires, busie in pacifying Bretayn, which is otherwise called Armorica; which, as yet, Duke Mercury, one of the Lor∣rain Princes, (the Fury of both Parties being asswaged) forcibly detained, having deliver'd to the Spaniards the Port of Blavette, that they might with more ease land with Sup∣plies. But he seeing the King's Army prepar'd on the one hand, and a Pardon offer'd in the other, and knowing well that when an end is put to a War, all subsequent Offences are with severity punish'd, obtains for himself, and his noble Conditions, and an Augmentation of Honour. The King, at this time, was happily without a Wife, Mar∣garet of Valois being divorced from him; but though his Body was exercised in Military Matters, yet his Mind was liable to the Darts of Love, for he was absolutely taken with one Gabrielis Estraea, a Noble Woman, but led aside from the Embraces of her vowed Husband: This Woman, what with her Beauty, and what with her sweet Temptati∣ons and alluring Arts, had so vanquish'd the King, that ad∣vancing her to the Title of a Dutchess, which was then a
Novelty in France, so heightned her Pride, that though but a Concubine, she aspired beyond the Greatness and Authority of a Wife: And she also was numbred among the Causes, that induced the King's Mind to be inclinable to Peace, that he might the more securely enjoy his pleasures with her. She had a Son by the King that was four years old, and at that time called Caesar, whom the King, with great Obtesta∣tions, gave in Charge to Mercury, (this Woman had also by the King a Daughter very young) and appoints to the said Mercury a great Allowance of Money, and bestowing upon his Son the Dukedom of Vendosme, and the Government of Bretaign. And now the Embassadors of Holland just arrive, and find the King puffed up with these Matters, together with the Spanish Pacification; and yet, if by chance that had failed he had called a Council of the Brittons, to consult about the Siege of Blavette. Mounsieur Buzanvale, who was well-skill'd in Affairs of that sort, and one of the King's Council, was there present, who went and recommended the Embassadors to the King; who▪ after he had received their Salue, very pleasingly and without any pride, Olden-Barnevalie, in a grave and compo∣sed stile, according to his Custom, began [First to applaud the hopes of his Alliance, to urge their lae made League, and to require his faithful performance thereof, which would be much to the advancement, both of the King's Honour and Authority; and advised him to take heed of the Peace that was offer'd him: Adding, in the Name of the States, many Promises of Assistance and Money for the future, both by Sea and Land, which way soever the King would please to com∣mand them, that the War might, in some manner, be again renewed against the Spaniard: urging also many other things, that might inflame their Minds, to resolve anew to fall to Arms. And, among the choice of the King's Council, it was
debated, how much more safe and honourable would it be, to make an Example to Posterity of this Enemy, whose Treasury was drained, and Mind perplexed, with the waver∣ing Obedience of his Subjects; witnessed, by his seeking for Peace, as well his fear, as the inconveniences he suffer'd out of this League of ours to deter, for the future, any from thir∣sting after the Dominions that are belonging to another.] There were present at this time the English, who now more freely commemorating the many Benefits they had done him, and how unworthy an Act it was to lay aside his sworn Faith for present Utility, helped forward the Speech made by the Dutch, sometimes by their Silence, and sometimes by applauding Speeches, not forbearing to demand the Mo∣ney which had been lent to him. The King, on the other side, dealt plainly, confessing his Necessities to be such, as would not bear slow Remedy: And that he doubted, for all this Noise of Peace, whether the Spaniard would deliver up to him, either Calais or Blavette; which if he did not, he assu∣red them he would continue the War; giving them Thanks, that they had so freely offer'd their Assistance. The States Embassadors replyed, That if the King rested in that Judg∣ment yet they hoped their coming and Offers would be ad∣vantagious to France, and cause the Enemy to make larger Concessions, than perhaps otherwise he would: And there∣fore they pray'd, on behalf of their Masters, that if a Peace were concluded, yet the Alliance might continue between them; by which the Hollanders might mke use thereof to their private benefit, and to the security of the French in the mangery of the War in Holland. The King answer'd, That he would be willing, not onely to continue his own Friend∣ship with them, but that they should likewise enjoy the bene∣fit of the Friendship he was to have with others: Those things at present being onely removed, whereby the Com∣merce of several Nations was hindred; and how much might be wrought thereby, was learned by Experience in the
future Times, when the King, no less intent to keep, than to get Money, gave so much scope to the defence of Liberty, as the Kings of old would hardly have afforded to any People, unless with a Design to intrench upon it. The first Liberality given to him was two hundred and forty thousand Florens, which after, in the Years following, was increased accord∣ing, as his Necessities required: For now remembring the Monies he had received from his Allies, and at what time, he resolved how he might repay the same, that it might not seem altogether as the payment of a Debt; but as if it car∣ryed along with it the grateful shew of a Remuneration: Here the King carefully excusing his own, highly applauded the Counsel of the States, that they would stand upon their Defence, since (which few Kings could boast of) they could, upon occasion, be on a suddain in a readiness, in re∣gard any new Necessity would forthwith put the idle Multi∣tude into Arms. For maintaining this Friendship with the King, because Levinus Calward dyed there in performing the same, Fran∣cis Arsen was left in France, whose Father Cornelius wrote the Chronology of the States. And now it appear'd, that the Spaniard had by many Ar∣guments perswaded the French to lay down Arms, being contented, rather to have the English still their Enemies▪ than to make a Peace with them upon equal Terms: And this was the cause, why the Holland Embassadors in France, Ju∣stire Nassau, and Olden Barnevelt, went thence into Eng∣land, neglecting thereby a while their former Embassie, and assuming a boldness, till that time dreaded; where they de∣liver'd themselves in Terms, to this effect, That if the Queen would follow the French, there should be no hazards of Peace so great to the Hollanders, that they would not rather hazard, than singly to undergo the unsupportable Burden of the War.
And these Dissemblers thus used their Art, as believing that the English would yet disturb the Pacification, if they supposed the Hollanders could be drawn to it: But they of∣fer'd the Queen all manner of Assistance, if she would Re∣solve to continue the War; and the hope of perfecting the same with Expedition, though she had hitherto for a time surceased, as being moved rather to incline to Peace. In this mean while at Vrbin, (for thither was the Meet∣ing, upon the Treaty, adjourned from St. Quintins) by the endeavour of the Embassadors, a Peace was concluded be∣tween those two eminent and great Princes of Christendom, containing the same Articles, which formerly had been con∣cluded on 29 Years before, between the same Philip, and King Henry the Second of France; onely there was a small Addition of some others, which to insert here in words at length, I think to be altogether unfit for him, who professeth himself to write onely the Dutch Affairs: However, in brief, take them thus: That there should be a free Trade between the People; That all Prisoners should be set at liberty, and at their going away, should be restored to what they had lost, or had been detained from them; That the Spaniard received into the County of Charlois, should, in the Name thereof, owe to the French Faith and Homage; That Calais, and other places in Picardy, and last of all Blavette, as they Were then, should be deliver'd up to the French, all other places, which the Spaniard had fortified, being dismantled: These were the Articles agreed to, and accordingly, having given Pledges on both sides, they were within Three Moneths after performed. But for the Oblivion of Injuries, and continuance of mutual Concord for the future, that if War were made upon either of them, the other should nei∣ther help against him himself, nor suffer any belonging to him to interest themselves; and if any thing of doubt arose between them, that it should be argued, neither by Violence
or Fraud, but referred to indifferent Judges. But these things were agreed more for shew, than that such equal Greatness should leave any Thing out, that might seem to secure Friendship. Both of Them comprehended their Allies by Leagues, whether Kings, Princes, or People; especially Phi∣lip took Care for his Daughter, to whom he was about to give the Low-Countries; as also, for the Duke of Savoy. Here∣upon, Areschot, Mendosa, and Aremberg, went into France, and Mareschal Biron was sent by the King to Bruxels, to see Albertus take the Oath, where the impotent Mind and Spirit of that great Souldier, which was always beyond his For∣tune, was said to be corrupted into Treachery, which after∣wards more clearly appear'd. All Things, on both sides, being thus done, for the con∣clusion of the Peace, which yet was repined at by some, whose Valour and Hopes was nourished by other Mens Evils; but all the Commons rejoyced at it, not so much for that, hereby much Christian Blood would be saved, as for that the Law was restored to its power, by which they should with security enjoy their Possessions, reap the Rents and profits of their Lands, and the Ways be all open for free Trading. Then was the first day, that France could boast of a solid Peace, after it had been for 36 Years wasted with War, and bathed in her own Blood, then was restored to this most an∣tient Kingdom its pristine Face of Beauty; and all by the King's Care, that the Governours and Magistrates being re∣duced to Order, himself growing powerful, by the Excuse of the Catholikes, in regard of the Times, that he might by Fear or Force compel the Professors of another Religion; when, in the interim, the Netherlanders were left in Arms, that they might not onely lose the Hopes of Peace, but any inter∣val or solace from their Neighbour's sufferings: Yet the King sent back Mounsieur Buzanvale to the Hollanders, by which Witness of his Friendship, and secret Converse, he
might confirm his Peace, even while there continued by publike Declaration a Forein War. The business of France thus finish'd, there was no less Experiment of Princely Al∣liance received out of England, by the earnest Desire of Qu. Elizabeth; which being related to the States by Sir Francis Vere when at the same time, other Embassadors were sent to Albertus, as if she would seem still to retain the hopes of Peace; of which, she said, This had been the onely Delay hi∣therto, that she desired to lay down Arms with the same Col∣leagues, for whom at first she took them up: And that nothing could be now demanded of her by the Hollanders, but onely Right, they having given the first cause of War, it was necessary, if it might be, that an end should be put to it by them; but if not, that, for the future, they should give their Reasons for the continuance of it. And certainly, it would be a sufficient Cause for all Prin∣ces to envy and hate them, that they have been, and are, the onely Obstructers of the Peace of Europe: But God, she hoped, would not suffer, that being deluded by ingrateful Determinations, she should be a Pattern to Princes, to abstain from helping such a People, who bear no Reverence to their Superiours, nor take care for Advantage, Reputation, or Safety, of any but themselves. The States now thought themselves, at one blow, almost overwhelmed, both for their former and future Charge: yet, that, the Name of an Alliance with England, was of such be∣nefit to them, that they would submit to such Conditions, as the Queen of England, being their Superiour in strength, would lay upon them: Wherefore, sending them who had been employ'd in both the former Embassies, together with Andrew Ascel, who had private Instructions, which gave him power of Treating, concerning the Monies due to her, and concluding about the same, even to the Sum of a Hun∣dred Thousand Florens. At this time, there were divers oc∣casions offer'd themselves to the Queen, who already pre∣tended great Fears, whereby she was disswaded from War. For James King of Scotland, of whom Queen Elizabeth made
no mention, secretly claiming the Inheritance of the Crown Of England, did not think himself able enough thereto, unless he were supported by some Forein Help: Not did there want some, who, pretending to have found some Letters written by King James that came to the Pope, raised from thence great Hatred and Jealousies: Moreover, the Lord Burghley being grown very weak, through Age and Disea∣ses, Beseeched her, as she loved God, to have regard to his dy∣ing Words; whereby he advised Her, That she would give Cre∣dit to him, now going out of the World, that she would, without an inforcement of Necessity, consult the good of her Kingdom, and by the making of Peace in Earth, merit the everlasting Peace of Heaven: Nor did he omit, to declare to her, her ill Fortune in America, and the fear that was conceived of the Irish Affairs; affirming, That the Belgick Wars were never to be ended by Conquest. As soon as this man was dead, and Essex, for the avoiding of Envy, declined to come to the Council-Table, the Court soon appear'd empty of Care and Counsel, in Defence of its own Right: Whereto the States Embassadours being often admitted, they excused themselves, by reason of the Times, for their not paying of the Queens old Debt due from them; professing, That as to what related to the Spanish Negotiation, they did not intercede, whereby the English, if they pleased, should be hindred more than the Dutch, from making use of the Name of any People being in Peace, unless they believed it more profitable to compass what they desire by Arms, than by Commerce or Trading. Neither did they desire, but that the League made 18 years be∣fore (when the Troubles of Antwerp affrighted the English no less than the Hollander) yet never faithfully observed, should so long after be changed into another form, that it might now bind all those, which before thought themselves free from the performance thereof. Sometime was spent in debating and setling the Sum of the Debt, for that the Engish reckon'd their Musters of Men,
and their Transportation and Wages too high; while, the other side averred, those Musters to be untrue; maintaining withall, That several Naval Expeditions of the English had cost the Hollanders more, than all the Money they ever borrow'd would make a Compensation for. At last, after Cautions en∣tred, it was agreed to the Sum of Fourscore Hundred Thou∣sand Florens: The one part of which should be paid by Three Hundred Thousand Florens Yearly during the War, And, at the end of the War, if ought remain'd behind, it should be paid by Twenty Thousand Florens Yearly: The other moiety, should be peaceably appointed, when there was a Peace concluded, and payment thereof made, upon the Surrender of the cautionary Towns: In the interim, the English should continue their Garrisons therein, to the num∣ber of One Thousand, a hundred and fifty. By this Reckon∣ing also, the States were to pay every Three Moneths Five Thousand, and a Hundred Florens to the said Garrisons, be∣sides all other Necessaries fitting for the Souldiers. And, for the future, the Queen's Promise of sending hem more Aid, was remitted. The English that were in the States Service already, or hereafter should be Listed for their Service, should be raised onely in their Name, and should fight under their sole Command, and at their Charge: And from thenceforth, the so much envyed Authority of the English Embassadour, was absolutely taken away: Yet still the Queens Priviledge of nominating an Assistant to sit with the Senate, was reser∣ved: If the Queens Enemies should invade her, either by Land or Sea, or the Queen should think sit to make War up∣on her Enemies, the Dutch, upon notice, should add to her Fleet 30 or 40 lusty and stout Ships; together with an Army of Five Thousand Foot, and Five Hundred Horse. Upon these Articles and Covenants, a firm Agreement was made; but reserving to the Queen her Right, that she might vindicate her cause against the Netherlander, under the King of Spain's Jurisdiction.
There was excepted out of this League, Horatio Palavi∣ne's Debt of Fourscore Thousand Florens, which was after∣wards privately compounded. It was not, that England chose Peace rather than War by this League; but that as it was eased of a Burthen, so it had gained thereby a Fortifica∣tion. Not long after this some were taken, who went about to poyson Queen Elizabeth; and, in Ireland, by one happy Fight, and the taking of a Castle, was the cruel Tyrone made Prisoner, while he was drawing the Province of Munster to partake in his Rebellion: No more did the Hollanders re∣pent them of their Old Resolution, although there was a new Face of Affairs with the Enemy, and many ways were sought to invite them. Aod now the Report of the New Marriage grew every day more frequent, these being Letters brought to the Ne∣therlanders by Friasio, whereby the whole Government of them was turned over to the Princess Isabella; The Causes and Articles of which, King Philip published to be these: When by the Pope's Licence he had destined, and by the Consent of all his Relations Resolved, to bestow his best Be∣loved Daughter in Marriage upon his Kinsman, he conceiv'd it would be of great Advantage to the Netherlanders, to the advancement of Peace, and settlement of the present Go∣vernment, that they might always have their Prince present among them; which their Ancestors could not be, in regard of their many and great Cares; and therefore he did give and grant unto his said Daughter, all the whole Country of the Netherlands, and every part thereof, together with Char∣lois, and the County of Burgundy, together with the Name of Duke of Burgundy, (for the French had long since got the possession thereof) yet so, that himself and his Successours, Kings of Spain, should enjoy the Honour of the same Title, with the chief place among the Knights, or Companions of
the Golden Fleece, being an Order instituted by his Fore-Fa∣thers. Adding moreover all other Things, that were thought fit by Men learned in the Law, for Confirmation of the Pre∣misses; by which the Rights of Principality, and the Reve∣nues, and all other Incidents pertaining thereto, might the more rightly descend, and pass unto the said Isabella, and her Posterity. These Things were the more remarkable, because Philip using the word (Clientole) did declare, That he gave all those Dominions to his Daughter in Fee: And this seems to be added, because the greatest part of the Lands were held of the Empire, and other part of the Crown of France; and then because by his Command, the Oath which the Nobles had formerly taken, was to be alter'd now from the Obligation to himself, in a New Obedience to his Daughter: And if any thing contained in these Instruments, seemed to contradict the Law in my point, that he did confirm by his Supream and Royal Authority: And if it should happen, that no Children should proceed of this Marriage, or that Issue, Male or Female, did ever fail, all the aforesaid Premisses, and the Right thereof, to revert to the Kings of Spain. And this was given as a Reward to the Merits of Albertus, that he might have the Government of the Netherlands, as a Com∣fort to his Wiowship. And if there were any Issue, then the use and profits thereof, but nothing to descend to the Heir, besides the Revenue of the Dutchy of Lutzenburg, and the County of Chiny. There was also prescribed an Order of Suc∣cession: First, to the Male, then to the Female, and so to the Younger, and the Elder Daughters Nephew should procede the Younger Son; That it should not be lawful to divide or alien the Lands, unless by the King's Licence; And it was provided also, that this Gift should return to the Donor many ways; As if any Woman should, for the future, attain the Netherlands, that it should presently return to the Hands of the King of Spain, or his Heirs; neither might it be lawful for a Son or Daughter, being Princes of the Country, to marry, or otherwise alter their condition, unless by the Consent of the same King.
Moreover, They are forbidden by themselves, or their Mi∣nisters, to intermeddle in the Trade of America, or the Indies, and that every one coming to that Government, is to swear to these Articles, and also to maintain the Romane Catholike Religion. And if any thing be done to the contrary, the Right of the Nether∣lands to come to the Spaniards. These Instruments were signed by the Father, and attest∣ed by Witnesses, the Sixth of May. The same day, the King's Son and Heir, Philip also by Name, gave his Consent to the same by Writing, carefully taking Cautions according to the Laws. There were divers Speeches concerning this matter, and they disagreeing among themselves, as is usual in such Cases: Some accused this as an Evil Custom, that the Heads of Free-men, or any private Service, should be rated and va∣lued: That it was onely used by Barbarians, to give and bestow Dominions: For of what value was a Prince among them, who never knew what belonged to Lordship: But to them that make a distinction between Right and Wrong, it is nothing ambiguous; because the matter belonging to the People, makes the Government, from thence, be called a Commonwealth: The ordering whereof, as it is in some places, committed to the Nobles or Senate; so, with most, it is set∣led under the Tuition of a Prince. Nor was there ever any just Empire, but what begun by the Consent of the People, who have trusted the Defence thereof, either to one Single Person; or else, by reason of Faction in Suffrages, to more; who have this onely Reward of their Honour, that next to their own Welfare, they take Care of the benefit of their Subjects: Which, as it is true every where, so is it more manifest among the Netherlanders, who being neither Con∣quer'd by Arms, nor yet willing of their own accord to serve, will not suffer their Princes to do many Things, but with a Limited Power and Revenues, it being chiefly for∣bidden,
left at any time they should break any part of the Trust commited to them: And therefore, in former Time, the Daughters were put off with a small Portion in Money: To the rest of the Children were given Governments, and other small Offices; the Name of King, unknown to the Ne∣therlanders being circumscribed by such Limits, needs nei∣ther to be feared nor opposed. The French Greatness in∣deed (if it be necessary to use Examples) no otherwise in∣creased than by this, that many Collations of Fortune meet∣ing in one, no cross Event ever separated or pulled them in sunder; whereas, on the other part, is it not a miserable con∣dition, that in Regions involved in, and exhausted by Wars, in whose Sides lyes a powerful Enemy, an envious Neigh∣borhood, and Forein Greatness, that should be taken away, which for a hundred Years had nourish'd it, and been as nu∣triment, and the Radical Moysture, to a weak and infirm Body? We find in History the Emperour Charles, when desirous of private Repose, by transferring his Worldly Cares on his Son, he onely a little anticipated the Gift of the Law, him∣self and his Son, both standing in the Great Council of his Nobles, that nothing might be wanting of antient Customs. But how by a Letter to renounce, and by a Letter to assume a Government, and by Sight and Speech, to seem to set free a People, as it were disdained, from one Dominion to ano∣ther, and that not virile; when it was known from all Anti∣quity, that the Netherlanders accounted it as one of the greatest Mischiefs, to be subject to a Woman, was an Act of great Rashness. Others wished, that in good earnest, the Netherlanders might in this manner be freed from the Inso∣lence of the Spaniards; That, if the Council of War were removed: the difference of Parties and Factions would easily be reconciled: But, alas, the old Hopes and Arts of Philip were not so easily forgotten, as that he would denude both
himself and his Posterity of the Netherlands, which are the strength of the Spanish Security, and serve him as a Castle against Germany, France, and Brittain: But that by laying them a little aside he might diminish his fear, he makes use of his Daughters Name, to whom is given a precarious Right and a Titulary, but naked Profession, under a Domestick Trust: That, by these very Covenants, he hath not suffici∣ently dissembled with these, since the Government must re∣lapse onely to his Son, proceeding from this Marriage, and not to any other Children: And although it were not per∣ceived, yet it is not to be believed, that the Spaniards would have suffer'd this Lady to come from him, after a continued Virginity of 32 years, unless they had either blieved, or procured her, to become barren: That it was a shamefull thing, that the Netherlanders, being a People having Privi∣ledges of their own, and by whose Wealth the Austrin Fa∣mily hath augmented its Greatness in Spain it self, and so many other Kingdoms, and, in a manner, laid a Yoke upon the Neck of Mankind, should be publikely governed by Fo∣rein Laws, and deliver'd to the Dominion of such as are sub∣ject to the Spanish Power. Among all these Discourses, other Letters were brought, written now from Isabella, as Lady Paramount therein, Com∣manding Albertus, in her Name, to take possession, and mu∣tually to take and give an Oath of Obedience, and to do all other Things usual, in the like Cases, for Princes to do. This was against the Laws, which will, That the Entrance into a Government shall be publike: Wherefore he not daring, ac∣cording to antient Custom, to call a Senate of the Provinces, and with them freely to Consult; but as if he had had some∣thing in private to have said to every one apart, on the 15th of August, he calls to Bruxels onely the Deputies. At the same time, there was gather'd about the City a great Multi∣tude of Souldiers, to the number of 15000 Foot, and 2000
Horse, to keep in awe all that would but seem to gainsay thi Design: And therefore Richardot, in an Oration which he had prepared of purpose for Albertus, imputed all the Evils that had befallen to the Netherlanders, and the cause thereof to the Prince's Absence. Hereupon Masius answer'd for the Brabanters, beginning first Rhetorically with such Things, as might win the Favour of the New Princes: But when he came to the Matter, he disputed some Things, as if the An∣tient Commonwealth had yet been in Being, desiring such Things to be done, as the present Necessity requir'd. And it was submitted to by most, that Conditions should be pre∣scribed to their Obedience, viz. If within three Moneths it appear'd, that the Rites of Marriage were performed, and that he himself did return into the Netherlands within the Moneth of May, in the following Year; and that in the mean while, nothing was innovated by his Governours or Commanders; And that he left, as his Deputy-Governour, one allied to him by Bloud, all should be well. And hereupon he Elected, as his Deputy▪ the Cardinal Andrew of Austria, whose Father was Ferdinand Earl of Tirol, the Brother of Maximilian, the Fathe of Albertus: By the Mothers side, he was not so Noble, She being Philippa Velsera and descended from a Consular Family in Auspurge, a City of Germany. Besides all this, it was added, That all, both private and publike, Laws, and all things use, should remain firm by Oath to Philip; That the lesser Go∣vernments, and the Guard and Custody of Castles and Forts, and the several degrees of Judges, should be new chosen from among the Netherlanders; That the King should testifie, that in this yielding up of his Right in Fee, he had no intent to intrap the Netherlanders; That they would take care to pay the German, and their own Native Souldiers, as far as the Treasury would hear; but for the residue, and the Forein Souldiers, the King should take the Charge thereof upon himself; That Albertus should be content with the antient Revenue of the Frinces, and should ease the People of their extraordinary Taxes, and the con∣stant
Service they did in Garrisons, and the Charge of quartering Garrison Souldiers; And that upon these Terms, they should, for the time, be Obedient. But upon the Return of Albertus with his Wife, a Solemn Oath should be taken on both sides, all the States of the Netherlands being Assembled, with whom, in the interim, Albertus would deal, to win them to come to some Condi∣tions with the Hollanders. And because this was very earnestly desired, and it was thought no absurd Thing, to compare like with like, in making a Pacification: Albertus, before his departure, who did not think fit out of his Grandezza, to send a Princely Embassie, writ Letters to the States of Hol∣land and Zeland, and their Colleagues; wherein he signified unto them his Marriage, and the Right of Government tran∣slated from the Spaniards to him, who was ever studious and willing to make Peace; and therefore he hoped, there re∣mained nothing on their part, which should cause them, ei∣ther to distrust him, or the Peace he offer'd them: They would therefore do very well, and according to their Duty, if they would unite themselves to the greater part of the Ne∣therlands, having to this purpose left Instructions with the States under his Authority. In the same manner did the Prince of Aurange, Areschet, and Haurech, write to Prince Maurice, That he would, by his Authority, prevail as much as he could with the United States, to set an end (so much desired) to the War; That it would be not onely to his Renown at the present, but to the everlasting Honour, and advancement of the House of Nassau for the future. At this time was heard also one Daniel Molain, a private Merchant, but of great Repute; who, reported himself incited thereto by his Brothers dissembled sickness, and came to Antwerp, and from thence was brought to Bruxels, to the speech of Richardot, Assonville, the Abbot of Marol, Haurech, and at last of Albertus himself: The sum of all his Discourse was tend∣ing to Peace, so also were all their Counsels; and there was nothing omitted, that might obtain Credit among the Hol∣landers.
All the Princes protesting, That their Religion should not be medled with; that the Government of the Commonwealth should remain in the hands of themselves, and their Posterity; and that King Philip had such esteem of Prince Maurice his Ver∣tues, that he would detract nothing from his Honour, but destin'd for him the chief Command of the Hungarian Warre. But the States, although before they were resolved for War, yet grew more indurate and averse to Peace, by reason of some Let∣ters of Philip's by them intercepted; wherein the manifest contrary to all these former Offers was discover'd. And be∣sides these, the Treason of Peter Danny of Ipre was found out at the same time: He was a man of a slothful Nature; but such are generally the most ready Instruments to put in pra∣ctice the most impious Attempts. This man being suspected by his looks, and taken, related his Condition, That the Cru∣elty of his Creditors, to whom he was very much indebted, was such, that nothing would content them, but to throw his Body into the worst Prison they could find; of which, he endeavour'd with grief of heart to have an end, but could not find any means to com∣pass the same, in which perplexity he fell among the Jesuits at Doway, and served them for Wages. The President of whom, making a Speech, how great and meritorious a Work it would be to the Christian World, out ef so many Multitudes of men, to kill but one, which raged with Cruelty, working the destruction of many: this presently inflamed his Mind, over-whelmed before with Misery, to murther Prince Maurice; And if he did it, him∣self (if he survived) or else his Son was to be rewarded: But if he failed in the Attempt, yet they promised him to go to Heaven. He added further, That by the Domestick Exhortation of his Wife, who being restless, by reason of her Cares, and not able to in∣dure a little misery, was urged to put on a Man-like Resolu∣tion to act his Design: where with being instigated, and confirmed therein by the same President, by the Sacred Tye of Religion, and the Absolution of his Sins, he took his Journey, and came
into Zeland, and from thence to Leyden; where his Conscience beginning by little and little to dislike the villainous horrour of the Fact, together with the fear of danger that would insue, at last he began to repent, and alter his wirked Intentions. After he had many Times by Intervals repeated these same Things, being convict by his own Testimony, on the 23 of July he was put to death by Command of the Magistrates of Leyden, whose Sentence was confirmed by the Superiour Judges. There were some on the adverse Party, who, ashamed of the wickedness of the Fact, would have denyed the whole sub∣stance of the matter. As this Year was famous for great Alterations, so was it a long time very free from Warlike Expeditions; only near Nmeghen a few Foot Souldiers were worsted by some of the King's Horse; and again, beyond the Maes, among many Troops of the Hollanders, one belonging to Mansfeldt was slain, the Conquerours returning not without Prey: Be∣sides, a few other petty Attempts, and vain Endeavours to have done greater: The reason of this Quiet might be, be∣cause the United States spared their Provisions and Charges for Times of Necessity; and for that Albertus labouring to add a great Terrour to his offer'd Peace, had determined not to proceed, before his Army was increased with the Re∣giments that came from the Cities of France, that were to be deliver'd according to the Treaty. Which Regiments de∣nying to surrender the Garrisons they held, until they had received their Pay, and a dreadful President beginning in the Town of Chastellet, by Seditious Licentiousness; for that Money being raised for them, made other places, more in∣ward in the Country, to rage with unwonted Fury; and chiefly, because he saw, that Count Heremberg was not able to appease the Tumult in Gelders, without present Money, and immediate sending them away.
At this time, there were some grumbling Complaints, and contumacious Behaviours: But when the Business of setling a new, was put in Agitation at Antwerp, (as generally the Souldiery love to make Disturbances about the Changes of Governments) Seditions broke out in several places at once, but chiefly among them that kept the  a Antwerp, being 500 Spanish Foot, with some Horse; who, being bent against the City, which they supposed obnoxious to them, were provoked to take from thence the Price and Reward of their Crimes: Wherefore, putting out their Old Com∣mander Augustin  Mexia, they Elected into his place a Sergeant, a Fellow of a Malapert and Sawcy Tongue, but faithful to his Companions, in their greatest Crimes. They reckon'd due to them, as well for their Belgike, as Italian Ser∣vice in the Wars, the Remainders of 22 Months Pay, which, while they were paid off, they compelled, in the interim, the Towns People to allow a Floren a day to a Horseman, and half as much to a Footman: Nor did their injurious pro∣ceedings rest here; for they set a Tax upon all pretious Gar∣ments and Houshold-stuff and all other Instruments of Lux∣ury not spating those Sinks of Iniquity, common Strumpets; and all this was done in contumely of that, but late most flourishing City. Without doubt, there was never any Acti∣on shew'd more arrogant Pride, than their manner of exact∣ing: They would shoot off their Muskets, and other Guns, until the People came voluntarily, and asked them, Whether they would please to command any thing? Soon after this, the Garrison Souldiers of Liere were observed to associate Themselves in Counsels; and, in the Borders of Lutzenberge, Messengers brought word, that the Walloon Regiments, ha∣ving thrown off their Obedience, did fortifie themselv, th many others flying out of the City: They who staid there, either by reason of their Estates or Business, part of them compared this Force with the Dissimulation of Requesene's formerly; others likened it to the violent Irruption, Slaugh∣ter,
and Devastations, made with Fire by Rhoda; thus weighing their present Fear by their past Sufferings. In all this hurli-burly, the Deputies of the Magistrates, brought no other Comfort from Albertus, besides Excuses of the publike Poverty; so that for want of Remedy, this Mutinous Licentiousness continued until the Year follow∣ing: the Souldiers, in the Castle of Gaunt, were a little more modest; for being content with their own Number, they would not receive any that came from other places, which, in this time of common Disturbance, seem'd a great part of Honesty. But, in the City of Grave, there was not a Mutiny, but a Fight of the Souldiers among Themselves; but when the Germans ran to Arms, in Assistance of the Towns-men against the Spaniards, that Commotion quickly was appeased beyond hope. After all which Disturbances, Albertus being thereby spurred up to Arms; and, the rather, because he received no Answer to his Letters, either from Prince Maurice, or the United States, he took away from the Souldiers, their hope of continuing in their Garrisons: What Money could be scraped together, either out of Spain, or upon Credit, He distributed among such as were going to the Camp, as well old, as new raised Souldiers, which made a great Supply, and consisted chiefly of French-men, who fled from the late made Peace at Home. Now upon Debate of the Matter in the Senate, and with the most skilful, and understanding Collonels, it was though fit, that the Army should march beyond the Rhine, either for the invading of the Hollanders, or else, that they might un∣do what Prince Maurice had done; who, in the former years, in the setling of Frizeland, had finish'd one part of the War for the United States; where the Country being large and open, on the backside towards Germany, and but meanly it engthned with Towns, he shew'd-many notable Examples of good Conduct and Industry, in laying hold upon all con∣venient Opportunities.
Now, as this was in it self very prudent Counsel, to sur∣round the Hollanders on all sides with their Armies, to di∣minish and abate their Tributes, and to disturb their Garri∣sons; so, at that time, there was nothing more fit, than ha∣ving retrenched the Treasury as much as they could, if yes with all their Forces they could spend the Winter in the Ene∣mies Country, they should destroy the Hollanders by their own President. About the middle of Autumn, Army was commanded to meet, at the Maes, over which Francisco Men∣usa was made General, who was returned out of France, af∣ter the Confirmation of the Peace there. Whereof, as soon as the Hollanders heard, Count Hohenlo being Commanded to look to the Isle of Bommelerweart,, the greatest part of their Forces, under the Prince's Conduct, met at Arnheyme. In this interim, Albertus being about to go to perform his Mirriage, and receive his Principality; yet, first by the Pope's Licence, laying down his Honours of Cardinal, and Arch∣bishop of Toledo he shew'd himself publikely in his Archidu∣cal Habit; He Dedicated his Cap and Sacred Robe at the Altar of the Blessed Virgin, which is honour'd at Hall, a Free Town in Hvalt. This was an antient Temple, famous for many Pilgrimages thither made, and Miracles there wrought, where by the Inhabitants were perswaded, that the Deity te∣stified himself there present. For there might be seen many rich Gifts of Princes, and great Multitudes of the Common People; who, having been deliver'd from Dangers, or Dis∣eases incurable by Physick, have here performed their Vows: Nay, some Reports do not stick to tell, that at this place dead Bodies have been restor'd to Life: Many Relations of this place, concerning Things some few Years before done, are set forth by Justus Lipsius in the Latine Tongue; by which he denoted to the World, the Truth of the Romane Catholike Religion, and the Reverence due to Images: Although on the other side, some Dispute in their Writings, alledg∣ing the known Fraud of Priests, and many other Stories feigh∣ed
for Gain; most of which being called Miracles, have ei∣ther hapned naturally, or by accident: And yet those old Magitians of Egypt, and Tyaneus, and other Masters of Con∣demnable Worship, because they confirm'd their Opinions and Tenets by stupendious Works, seeming preternatural, it must be brought at last, as an Argument, to work upon our Faith to believe the like, who assign all our Devotions onely to God; not requiring the Patronage of others, not corrupt∣ing our Piety with the forbidden Superstition of Images. After, the Cardinal Audren, being sent for by hasty Let∣ters, was come out of Alsatia, whereof he then had the Go∣vernment by Caesar's Authority, Albertus giving him onely some few Embraces, and leaving with him his Commands, immediately went into Germany. To his Train were added some of the most Noble Counts of the Netherlands, who were, in the Name of the Publike, to give Thanks to the King; and there certain select Matrones, and young Ladies, who went also to attend the new Princess: Among the Noble∣men that were selected, was the Prince of Aurange; whom, many, ignorant of the Power of Custom, admired to see re∣turning into Spain: He, when he had receiv'd of his own in the Netherlands, what the King's Exchequer had drain'd, and could procure his Fathers Goods among the Hollanders, means of his Brother, and his Mothers, by the help of Coure Hohenlo he was wholly bent to look after his Principality of Aurange; which, although it had been always free, and ought no Obedience to any; yet, by occasion of the Civill Wars, some of the French Governours having entred therein did yet, though the War were ended, retain, or rather usup the same, and now of late Prince Maurice had sent thither Allegond, in vain affecting by Treaties, and other arcs, to have gotten the possession thereof. But he now hoping, that the Spaniards might to him some kindness to the French King, by their Recommendations of him, was the main Mo∣tive that induced him to the taking of this Journey into
Spain; which having begun, and when now he was gone higher towards the Bank of the Rhine, he turned towards the Palatinate, to see the Elector's Sister then first, and but newly marryed. But as the Arch-Duke was proceeding in his Jour∣ney to Prague that he might communicate some of his secret Counsels with his Brother the Emperour; and, as it was be∣lieved, upon the hopes of attaining the Name and Honour of King of the Romans, which is next of all to the Emperour, he was overtaken by Messengers, who brought him the News of King Philip's death. The Relation whereof, as it hapned, was thus. His weak and crazy Body was broken with old Age, but chiefly from the last fore-going Spring, with sharp pains of the Joynts, but in the Summer his sickness began to incease: To whom, that he might have some ease, by the Relaxation of his Mind, he commanded his Servant to tarry him in his Horse-Litter to the Eseurial, a Palace which he had sumpru∣ously builded with extraordinary Cost; while, in the imeirm the Netherlandish Affairs languish'd, and lay gasping for want of Money: This Palace is reckon'd among the most famous Instruments of this Age. Then being unable to endure the tossing of the Litter, and the thickness of the Air, as soon as he was reposed, he fell into a Feaver, his Sinews being more contracted than ordinary, and at the same time the Poyson that lay hid in his Bowels broke cut; in which, and in his Legs, being inflamed through pain, he was likewise afflicted with a stopping in his Breast. These Things being removed by Physical Administrations, he fell into a Frenzy and, at the same time, sad to tell, he was follow'd with an infinite quantity of Lice; so that by the labour of many hands about him, he could hardly be kept clean from the silth that pro∣ceeded from them: Apon after, when his weak Body was not able to indure any longer such handling, as was necessary to make him clean, his Bowels were eaten up with a filthy Contagion; but with such an invincible Courage bore the
Torments, that they perceived he was yet alive, but retired himself to Meditations of his End: So commanding the Crown to be laid close by him, and afterwards shewing his Lims to his Son and Daughter, he instructed them in Hu∣mane Frailty; and particularly, read a Lecture of his own Weakness, who had been of so great Esteem in the World. Then he commended them to Brotherly Concord among Themselves, and to the maintainance of the Romane Faith; with great seriousness advising Them, That when he was dead and buried, they would remember those their Fathers dying words. Then while Divine Prayers were singing, he received the ex∣treme Unction; and now drawing on to his Death, he embra∣ced the same Crucifix, which his Father before at his Death had also done. Then giving in Charge, what he had in his Mind concerning Religion, and commending to them seve∣ral Examples of Clemency, on the 14. Day of September he dyed; which day he had fore-told to be fatal to him, from the Dictates of an Astronomer. This was the End of that most potent Christian Prince, who was the richest in his Time: He was of the Age of 71 Years, and had Reigned 43. He was of a middle stature of Body, and well compos'd, onely his Fore-head was somewhat high; his Lips were large, and hanging down, after the manner of all who are re∣lated in Bloud to the House of Austria; His Countenance carryed the Lineaments of a Netherlander, though his Con∣ditions were altogether Hispaniolized; you would have be∣lieved him to have been of a mild Nature, for that he was, easie and affable in access, and did not fall rashly into passi∣on; but as often as he was acquiring, or looking after Domi∣nion, he did rather prefer his Fame, than his Clemency. He was not so cunning and subtle as his Father, but Age and Diligence supplyed that defect; for being very moderate, both in Sleep and Recreations, he did more Personally, than by his Servants and Ministers; which the Spaniards extol∣ling to the highest, equalled his Praise with Solomon: He
so well knew the use of Money, that he would renounce what Emperours or Popes he pleas'd almost, and with that Key unlock'd the Secrets of all Kingdoms, bearing both Prospe∣rity and Adversity with an equal Countenance and Cou∣rage; but being given much to Dissimulation, he indulged to himself the Liberty both of Hatred and Jealousie; unsatiable in his Hopes, and in his Ambition and desire of Rule, to be matched with any of the Antients; most observant of Reli∣gion, which he shew'd even in his outward Actions: Con∣cerning his Rules of Government excusable, as walking by the Pattern of Princes; and in those Things wherein he of∣fended as a private man, laudably modest. He maintain'd Wars continually, even from his Childhood; yet besides that in France, which he onelay saw when he was young, he was never personally in any, but managed them all by his Deputies: He merited variously, as to his Progenitors and Successours, whose Empire, as he augmented by the Ameri∣can Treasures, and the Accession of the Crown of Portugal, so he lessen'd it by the loss of the Kingdoms of Goleta and Tunis, and by his Tyranny over the Dutch: At Times it was observed, that divers Things hapned untowardly in his Pa∣ternal Dominions; but not in the Age of those men, by whom his Fortune was upheld, but when he had Women, Children, or weak Emulators, or Enemies. These were, for the most part, the Judgments of the wiser sort concerning him: But others, who were offended at him as Enemies, say, That he on ertook Wars rashly, and managed them persidiously: Nor do they less accuse him for the Cruelties of his Peace, both in Spain and the Low-Countries, his throwing France into Troubles, by his Ambition and Thirst of Bloud, and many other, as well Publike as Domestick Evils; making the soul∣ness of his Death an Argument against him: averring, The Justice of Heaven met him at last, and punish'd him for the inno∣cent Deaths of his Son, and Wife Isabella; this murther'd by his
Father; that by her Husband: So that meritedly he dyed, as Herod, (with whom, in regard of his Nature and Fortune, they compared him) or as Pheretino, Queen of the Cerenians, and with them suffer'd the Vengeance of his Parricides; or, that he meritedly perish'd, as being a most bitter Enemy of True Religion; according as the most famous Antiochus, another Herod, Caesar Maximinus, or of the Tyrant Cassan∣der and Sylla, that were Oppressors of the Common Liberty, whose Memories stink: Although, if it be true, that it is re∣membred in History, that many men, famous for Wisdom, learned in the Laws, skilful in the Art of Poetry, and others, have dyed of the same Disease. Philip, the Son, had possession of all his Father's Kingdoms by Inheritance, being the Third of that Name; and there was hardly ever any Change of Government that carryed along with it so great Wealh But, among the Hollanders, many men, in their antient Simplicity, who had hitherto believed, that they were perpetually bound to that Prince, to whom they had sworn Obedience now, by the Kings Death, thought Themselves freed there-from, both in Conscience and Re∣ligion: And now in Spain they began to take very sharp Counsels against the Hollanders, which did much fully the Fame and Repute of the New King, as if he had been of an unfound Constitution. But many times it appears by use, That Things are often better, and more safely, managed un∣der a Prince, who will fit his Ears and Commands of others, whom he finds knowing in the State, than where a Confi∣dence of his own Wisdom, makes him rash and obstinate to his own Humour, and Will. But these Things will (in time) be made more plainly appear. Albertus going out of Bohemia into Italy, in the Venetian Territories finds Margaret, who, about 14 Years ago, ha∣ving been Betrothed to the King's Son, was now upon her Way to King Philip, and was come from Graic, a City of
Hungary, through the Streights of the Alps near Trent, to∣wards the River Athesis: The Brother of this Lady, being named Ferdinand, to whom the Vicinity of the Turks was hateful; and being desirous to change the Form of his Re∣ligion, (for most in that Country had departed from the Ro∣man Church) first intreated the House of Austria to inter∣cede, and afterwards to fight in his Defence. This Lady had also two other Sisters; the one, marryed to the King of Poland; the other, to Sigismund Battor, Prince or Vayvod. of Transilvania, but both very unhappy in their Husbands, both their Countries being afflicted with worse than Civil Wars: For He of Poland, following the Jesuits Counsels, by means of his Uncle, whose Name was Charles, was beaten out of the Kingdom of Sweden, the Antient Inheritance of his Fathers; And the other, perswaded by the same Authors, to deny the payment of Tribute to the Turks, soon after, being unable to defend his Territories, was forced to transfer his Principality to the Emperour, who gave the Government to his Brother Maximilian. That was He, who, when he possessed the Kingdom of Poland, made a Journey against the Swede onely for Forage sake; and being afterwards taken Prisoner, and quite for∣saken by all, would yet retain the Name of a King. But Bat∣ler, under the Name of Exchange, was sent into Silesia; and moreover, being Robbed of his Wife, as if unable to get Children, being soon weary of his wandring Life, and mean Fortune, he returned to his own Country, and at once recei∣ved both his Old Dominions, and his Wife, threatning all that durst resist with the Turkish Power which would come in his Aid: The Mother of this Margaret was a Bavarian, and being the Emperour Ferdinand's Niece, had marryed his Son Charles, from which Marriage proceeded this Issue: So that having  Father, and great Uncle, by the like Reason she might have a Husband, to whom the same great Uncle might be Father.
Pope Clement being come to Ferrara, (for he claimed this City, the Family of Atesti being extinct, and subjected the same rather by Threats and Devotion than Arms, when one Caesar by Name, but the Off-Spring of an unlawful Bed, chal∣lenged it) and the Proxies of King Philip, and his Sister Isabella, being ready, by Solemn Rites of Marriage, he Con∣joyned two Leagues by one Nation. Going thence to Man∣tua, and Millain, they met the Duke of Savoy, who also was come to salute his Kindred. Thus was one whole Year spent in Italian Complements; then they went to visit Sacred Mo∣numents, passing frequently by great and rich Cities; where; the Affections of Friends and Subjects contesting, with great Cost and Art the Austrian Greatness was excellently decipher'd in shews, and Albertus his own Victories repre∣sented to him in Effigie. But by reason of the Journey into strange parts, yet not absolutely divided from us, I will make a short digression; and before I repeat the Expedition to the Rhene, remember some Things about the Borders, which at this time were more than usually troublesome, by some occasions of difference among Themselves. Edsard, Earl of Frizeland, beyond the Eemes, being of∣fended with the Covenants made at Delfeziel, as extorted by Force, had appealed to the Emperour. The Emperour, who could neither approve Forein Decisions in German Affairs, not saw the Issue of them, which should be adjudged against the Will of a City, found yet this Expedient, That abrogating the Delfezylian Laws, he himself would command, in a manner, the self-same thing. The Earl being thus frustrate of his hope, when now he had a great while expected an Augmentation of his Power, this Year attempted to sow Intestine Discords in the City, already so exhausted by Troubles and Charges, that it could not pay the Money owing by Covenant, and other necessary Things, but by the Assessing of New Taxes: Wherefore, sending two of his Sons into the City, to foment
the Tumults, they sought out some among the Vulgar, that should gather together more, who were offended at the As∣sessments, (for of 19 Fraternities two refused) or else such as differ'd from the Publike Religion: with Directions, That they should, at the Gates, resist the Souldiers that were to come in; and whom he had sent for to that very purpose, though pre∣tending other matters. But, the Conspiracy being set afoot, the Magistrates, angry with the Earl's Sons, complained of the Father's Treacherous Dealings; and putting to death those, whom they found guilty of raising the Tumults, they banish'd the rest of the popular part of the Faction, or else fined them. One of the principal Leaders, in this Sedition, was Gruny, a man famous in his Family, and of great Alli∣ance, being Kinsman, among others, to Count William: He was of Kin, by the Father's side, to John Funquio, who for∣merly had presided the Belgick Affairs for the Spaniard; and, not long since, under pretence of private Business, had come among the Hollanders, But being detected, to have brought Albertus his Commands to Edsard, and asked what they were, answer'd, Nothing else, but to desire Passage for the Spanish Forces through that Country: Although it was believed, and indeed more congruous to received Judg∣ments, that he came to treat of an Exchange, concerning the very Right of that County with others in Burgundy, or else of Goods in Luizenburg. For this cause, he being for a while diligently kept, at length he was let go, upon payment of his Ransom, as a Prisoner of War, because he had violated the Publike Faith. But, at this time, some of the Funquio's Letters to Edsard were found, wherein he was advised, That he should not look after Germany, or other remote and lingring hopes, wherewith he had been so often vainly eluded; for nothing but the Spanish Power would ever restore him to his Government, but a Reward must be given to the Society, that at the time appointed, they might have leave to pitch their Camp in the Country; and that a Fleet should
be brought into the Mouth of the River, and the next Bay, with which he should sufficiently revenge himself upon his Rebels. For which Causes, Count William, the Governour of Frizeland, was desired, That he would have in readiness a strong Force to help them in time of need, whereof he took Care accordingly: And, in the interim, from the adjoyning Parts, commands a Party of well-armed and disciplin'd Souldiers, to take an Oath to he faithful to him; and then, as if they had bin dis∣charged by him, he causeth them to go into the City, and then to learn what more they could. But now the Concord of the Citizens being grown more firm, because the Conspi∣racy was Reported to intend Fire and Slaughter, and they were fearful, and not skilled in the use of Arms; and so wanting the help of a Forein Garrison, they Listed and took into Pay 300 men. But the Earl, as if he had receiv'd, not given, an Injury, of his own accord, summons the City to plead their Cause before the Imperial Senate, complaining there of many Things, as particularly, That the Holland Souldiers wasted his Fields; that they had inflicted extream pu∣nishments upon innocent Persons. against whom they ought not to make any Legal Process without him; that they had unworthily dealt with his Children, and compelled the Youth to make New Promises, whereby they should lay aside their Allegiance due to their Prince. Thus, in words, they seem'd onely to mind Le∣gal Proceedings; but, in deeds, they practised all kinds of Hostility. But both the Earls Sons went to the King of Poland (from whose Aunt they were descended) though to small pur∣pose; and there they put the Embden Exiles into a few ships, giving Command, That they should vindicate their own Right against the Authors of that injurious Oppression. And the Po∣lander, in honour of his Kinsmen, went o far, as to threaten the City with an Interdiction of Traffike, if it continued ob∣stinate; to the same purpose, writing Letters to the United States, stuffed with many proud Words, even to admiration;
That although he were deprived of his antient Kingdom of Swe∣den, yet he could come with hazard, and prescribe Laws to them, though so far distant. The Duke of Holsatia also, whose Daugh∣ter was marryed to Enno the Son of Edsard, commanded a Restraint of Trade with Embden, seizing all their Ships that were in his Coasts: The like also was endeavour'd with the Dane and Spaniard. The Dissentions of Aquisgrave continued longer between the Old Magistrates, whom the Duke of Juliers helped, as being Patron of the City by Hereditary Right; and Them who had obtained the Administration of the Common-Wealth, by the Expulsion of others, under pretence of giving Judgment against Them. Anon after, at the publike instance of the Spaniard by Mendosa and Clement, Determinations onely wont to be made in great Assemblies, were privately hastned, and by the Judgment of Spire the Occupiers were condemned: And because they would not perform the Judgment within the time limited, they were proclaimed Enemies to the Empire: Concerning whom it was thus De∣creed, viz. That it should not be lawful or safe for any to help them; That to offend, hurt, or kill them, shall be imputed to none for a fault, and that all their Goods may be taken from them as lawful Booty. The Custom is within the Year, to promulgate anew the same Proscription in harsher Terms. The Herald, after he had proclaim'd all Things in a solemn manner, com∣manded their next Neighbors of Germany, the Duke of Ju∣ers, the Arch-Bishop of Colen and Triers, with all their Powers, to defend the Authority of this Law. It seem'd good to these to take Albertus his Forces, that were as then ready, to assist Them: And now Garrisons were put into all the Towns within the Territory of Aquisgrave, and their Cattel, and whatever else was in the Fields, was taken away by the Souldiers of Juliers, and Limburg: But this did not agree with Them, whose City had been the Royal Court of Char∣lmain, and long continued the Metropolis of all the Regi∣ons
within the Alps; and, to this day, in all the Counsels of the Empire, a Seat equal to Rome and Millain, that They should utterly be excluded from all the Affairs of Germany. Thus the Governours being amazed, whom the Favour and Promises of the Augustane Profession, had made unaware of such a suddain Mischief; when on the one side they saw an Army coming under Mendosa; and, on the other side, the choice Souldiers of the Hungarian War, and that they could make no Defence, for the avoiding of Envy, they suffer'd the People to have the Government of the City. And here∣upon, the Arch-Bishop of Colen, being chosen Arbitrator and Intercessor, for the Restoration of Peace, by good just Laws, They avoided the Ruine that was coming upon Them; but the Customs which had prevail'd among. Them, for the space of 40 years, were alter'd: For a Garrison entring the City, all Offices, both high and low, were bestow'd upon Romane Catholikes, all such being remov'd, as the Lutherant and Calvinists, differing among Themselves, named as faulty. They who had born Offices, first were committed into pri∣vate Custody: Afterwards, par of Them (accompanied with many Netherlanders, (who being formerly Fugitives thither, because of their Evil Discords, were even pursued at the heels with these Evils) that for fear of more grievous punishments, their Adversaries conniving thereat) to the Hollanders; and other part of them to other places: Among these Exiles, that now returned, was Engelbert, who had for∣merly been a Captain of a Troop on the part of the United States, known more by his Military Vices, than any Vertue; and having, at the Council of Spire, obtain'd Licence to seize what he could, because he said his Wages were unpaid him, he fell upon the Netherlandish Merchants going to their Houses, with a Portsale Spear, and carrying with him persons to buy their Goods: Afterwards, he was chosen into the City Tribunal, and this made him so much the more cruel; untill by several Letters from the States written a∣gainst
him, he was moderated and kept under: For they took it ill, averring it a Thing intollerable, that publike Causes should be handled by private Persons, who were not able to distin∣guish among the Judges, between a true and false Name; ad∣ding Threats, in case they were not obtained: And forthwith it was so order'd, whereas before the Netherlanders could hard∣ly be secure from such Injuries in any Kingdoms. But it is in old and well-known Rule, That at the Power and Strength of a Party is, so are the Rules they give out obeyed. In the Dutchy of Cleves, the Councellors of the Duke as yet kept all the Authority, they were of the Austrian Faction. Nor did the Princes, who were concerned in the Inheri∣tance, trouble themselves, that Berck was taken by the Hol∣landers: The Nobles indeed of Cleves and Juliers, pretend∣ing the Guarding and Safety of their Diseased Prince, con∣sulted, as it were, with the States of the Provinces, for the raising of Forces, to the number of 2000 Horse, and 6000 Foot, which should lye upon their Borders, for Defence of the Country; whereas it was, in truth, to secure the Govern∣ment of the Common-Wealth to Themselves: But when they began to think of a General, some praising John of Nas∣sau; Others, the Count Hohenlo: But not finding a ready means to raise Pay for them, their long deliberation gave their Adversaries Opportunity of increasing their Power. These, and many other Things, were nothing so much fear'd by the Hollanders, as were those suspected Preparations made in Germany by Mendosa; for he had drawn together 62 Com∣panies of Spaniards, 19 of Italians, and two of Irish. Besides, he had of Germans 4 Regiments, consisting of 10 Compa∣nies, as many of Walloons, and one of Burgundians: So that the whole number of the Infantry was esteemed 20000. Of Horse, he had 6 Troops of Epirot Laucters, two of Spani∣ards, and two of Netherlanders, besides 5 smaller Troops, most of them Netherlandish Harquebusiers, and eight greater of Spaniards and Italians, yet all not much exceeding 2000
For the rest, to the number of 12 a Troops, were left about, Brabant, to be a Guard against suddain Incursions of the Enemy. Of a long time the King had not greater Forces, whose Number and Fame was almost doubled by the vast Compa∣ny of Slaves and Servants attending, and 1700 Carriages following the Army. Without doubt, the Face of the Nether∣lands, under the Spanish Obedience, was never more pleasant; for their Towns and Fields being eased of so great a Burden of Souldiers, especially upon the French Borders, they had now a small breathing space from their long-continued Mi∣series: The Enemy also being gone far from thence another Way, added Confidence to their Security. Count Frederick Heremberg, by reason of Count Mansfeldts great Age and Weakness, was Lieutenant-General of the whole Army un∣der Mendosa; but was by Them intitled Camp-Master-Ge∣neral: The Horse passing the River by Maestricht, some of them went to Venloo, others to Ruermunde; Thence spread∣ing themselves through Juliers, by the Territories of Colen, and other parts of Germany, they lay among those naked People without fear, and so came to the Bank of Rhene; Bar∣lotte was sent before, who was a Captain frequently made use of in Business, requiring either speed or audacity; for he drawing together what Boats and Wherries he could possibly meet within the River into one place, between Boe and Colen; and having with him 800 of his Men, and a small Guns call'd Drakes, he drove away the Ships of Holland, which had been left to keep Guard at Berck: Thus, many Souldier being taken, he enjoy'd the River free from Trou∣ble, and all the further Bank of it. All this while Mendosa lay heavy upon a quiet People, with an oppressive and licen∣tious Army; and because he could not remedy the Peoples Complaints, he abhorr'd to intermeddle in the moderation of their Oppressions; whereof many every where were con∣scious, that knew the Discords and Divulsions of Germany,
and how much it had lost of its ancient Renown gain'd by Arms: But to his Prince he was of a Couragious Spirit, and bore great Faith, while, performing his Commands, he was a Contemner of Forein Fame, and valued not Hatred, that was not attended with Power. It will not be out of the way, since the matter it self hath led us thither, to describe those several Nations which lye about the Rhine next to the Hollanders, and the Sites and Ex∣tents of the Countries, of the Princes and Bishops, formerly under the Obedience of the Almain Empire. I can, with more shew of Learning, than Truth, compare the Names of Antiquity with those now in use: For old Authors, no look∣ing much into Germany, have hardly mention'd them: But when the whole World was disturb'd, by the frequent Tran∣smigrations of one Nation to another, then Writers follow∣ing them increased the obscurity, every one drawing the Antiquity of Fame to the Honour of his own People. This I can almost assert that beyond the Hollanders, who possessed the Country next to the French Coast without the Island, which part opens between the Rhine and the Maes, and a few other places beyond both those Rivers; of Old, a Soyl full of Woods and Marishes, was the Antient Seat of the Menapii, from whom came the Eburones, and other Allied Nations; and this, at first, made the Germans to be called Tungri, which People afterwards attained the well-known River Moselle, or the Maes, and the Country of Triers. The Neruii with their Partakers, lay at the back of these, by the River Scheld; beyond whom, the Morini lay hedged in by the Forest of Ardenne, which is now the Bounds of the Ne∣therlands, but was formerly under the Dukes of Burgundy, and divided them from the Kingdom of the Franks or French. But after Agrippa Translated the Ubii out of the Region which is against Triers, to another part; or had taken into his Protection, such as had voluntarily transmirated, escially a Colony of the Romans being given him by his
Neece, and the Gugerni setled next to them, the Name of Menapii grew obsolete; but that some of the Inhabitants be∣ing driven into the inner part of the Country, first seem'd to seat Themselves on this side the Maes and Wael, after∣wards between the Scheld and the Morini. Hereupon all this Tract, from the Hollanders beyond Triers, even as far as Mentz, was possessed and planted by Romane Garrisons, and took the Name, partly of inferiour, partly of Higher Ger∣many, because the Original of the Inhabitants came from be∣yond the Rhine, as may easily be discerned by the Tone of their Speech to this day. On this side, upon the Border of the River, stands Wagening, Grinnes, Duren and Arnheym, all which were upon the French Bank, though formerly many were otherwise erroneously perswaded: From thence one might have been seeen Burtuatium, Drechshausen, and Acken, famous sometimes in the Dutch Wars; Emmerich also and Culo, but now so lost in their own Ruines, that the most Lear∣ned can but conjecture where they were scituate: But Nys, Colen, Bonne, Andernach, and Coblentz, keep both their Names and Stations unalter'd to this day. In after-times, all this Region, and the Country that lyes above it, was call'd Austrasia, because that part bordering on the East-side of France, was held by the Franks or French, who in most parts where they setled, gave new Names to the places: But they, at length, being weakned by their own Discords, the Almays Emperours, by bestowing larger Power and Liberties on the Prince's and People than they had before, drew to Them∣selves the Superiority of Government; and therefore they of Cleves, inhabiting on this side the Rhine, took that part of Gelderland, which is now call'd Low-Holland, and contains in it the City of Nimmeghen: With these is intermingled the Arch-Bishop of Colen's Territories, which extend a great way upon that Bank: Another part of Gelderland incom∣passes the Dutchy of Cleves, the Governours whereof were formerly call'd Guardians; and herein is the Town of Gil∣ders,
from whom the People of that whole Province take their Name: Behind these, the Old Maps and Descriptions would perswade us, that the Gugerni inhabited; and there is yet a Village in those Parts, that seems to speak something of their Name in its own, which is Gogen. At the backside of Colen is Gulick, an antient City, they have now the same Governours with Cleves, but formerly their Government was the same with Gelderland; yet more up into the Country are sited the Liegeos by the Maes, the Lutzenburgers by the Mselle, and the People of Triers; which two Cities of Liege and Triers are governed by Bishops, the rest are ac∣counted among the Netherlands: But, on the further Bank of the Rhine, which was the Antient Seat of the Almains, and Great Germany, Of Old, the Frizons were the first that met us, who, by reason they possessed the lesser part of the Regi∣on, were call'd the Lesser Frizons; from whence the Canine∣fates, (now People of Gorichom) coming into the Isle of Holland, were, on another side, compassed with great Lakes, and the Estuary of the llye, and from thence, by the Eemes, unil you come to the Ocean: To these are joyning the Grea∣ter Bructeri hard by the same River, and now opposite to the Menapii are the Remainders of the Sicambrians, after that People, either of their own Accord, or by the Compulsion of Augustus his Arms, had setled Themselves about the Wael. At Luppen we have the Lesser Bructeri again; which River, some of the Antients believed to run into the Sea: But others, more truly, that it intermingles with the Rhine, or rather the Issel, into which Drusus brought a part of the Rhine: But the incertainty of it, at present, is so great, that a man may in∣deed name a River, whereof there is no sign, but hardly shew the true place of its passage: But whatever it was, the Bru∣cteri, both greater and less, were beaten out thence: yet not so, as that their Names were utterly abolish'd. Soon after their Expulsion, the same place was possessed by the Chamavi;
and above them inhabited the People of Angermundo, together with the Marsi, who were shut up on the backside, by the Chattuarii, and the Dulgabini: Next to these were the Tubantes, but not the same that live by the River Issel, and the Tencteri, who were opposite to Colen, before whom, the Ubii possessed the same place: But these being expell'd, the Alemans, a sort of French People, came into their place about the Rhine: But further from the River Bank, were seated the Catti; between whom, and the Ocean, the Cauchi took up a large Continent of Land, all along from the Coast of Frizeland, to the River Elbe; but the Vueser running in the middle between these People, divided them one from ano∣ther. Adjoyning to these Cauchi, were the Saxons towards the Sea, and from thence the Danes beyond the Elbe. Which River being passed, if you would follow the Vueser farther from the Sea, you will find the Cherusei bordering upon the Cauchi, Angrivarii, and Catti; round about whom, the Suevi, with many other Nations, possessed both sides of the Elbe, and vast Lands backward, in the Heroynian Wood: These Suevi were a long time a most powerful Nation of Germany, so that oftentimes they drove away the People inhabiting nearer the Rhine: But Time, and the Vicissitudes of War, hath so alter'd these places, that they scarcely resemble Themselves in any thing: For as the Sea-Coasts belonging to the Cauchi, came to the Frizons, in probability, by such Appeal as we now use; so it is plain, that of the more inland part, which as we have said, was possessed by many of the French; some Nation or Nations coming from other Parts, out of Affection to Liberty, uniting Themselves in League and Name, took the possession: These first coming into the remoter Parts of Germany, and afterwards going forwards into France, made the Saxons flourish; who also enjoying something on this side the Elbe, and near the Rhine also, gave to this Western part the Name of Westphalia: This is the Ac∣count of all these several Nations.
The Rhine mixeth and powres it self into Issell, in that part of Gelderland, which is called Veluwe, to which we have elsewhere set forth Over-Issel to be contiguous. There we meet with Tuente for Tubantes, the antient name of a People; Nor should we lose our selves, to finde Tencteri in Drente, or Tarantij. There are also in the County of Herenberg, which is part of the Province of Zutphen, some glimmering of Sicambrian names; as also of the Bructeri, called more lately Boructuarij, every where about the Fenny parts of the Country: which things, though I know they please Learned Fancies, yet I will not dissemble, that it appears out of the former demonstration, that most of those Nations were very far distant thence, unless it be lawful for us to conjecture, that they came hither, being by force of Arms, driven out of their own Country. The Dutchy of Cleves, lying beyond the Rhine, joyns to the Province of Zutphen, even at the very edge of the Isle of Holland, and the Marquisate of the Empire, compasses the said Dutchy, lying in a long tract, each of them being under one Authority: From hence we see small Principalities, amongst whom, Nassau is opposite to Triers, at the River Lane, famous, either in its Latitude, or in the numerous Is∣sue of a noble Family sprung from thence. Next to Over-Issel, is Frizeland along by the Sea; which name now continues, even beyond the Eemes, as far as Embden, and behind, inclo∣sed with Oldenburg: The next that appears, is the Juris∣diction of the Bishop of Breme, both within the Vueser and the Elbe, after whom followes Holsatia, a part indeed of Germany, and a Dukedom, and so is Jutel, and an adjoyning Province of the Danes, but their Princes acknowledging their Allegiance due to the present Kings of Denmark; Now must we go through the inland part of the Country: the Dutchy of Cleves, and the Marquisate of the Empire, are bor∣dered by Munster, a Country of the same name with the City, under the Dominion of a Bishop. Neerer to Over-Issell,
is the County of Bentheym, from whence it is but an easie Journey, to Lingen and Teclenborge: which are subject to Counts, and so to the Bishoprick of Osnaburg, and the County of Duphold, and end your further enquiry at Ol∣denburg. Another part of the Country contains three Earldoms, or Counties, the first of Luppe, taking its name from a River therein, the second is Ravensporg, which now belongs to the Duke of Cleves; and the third is Lemgow. After which, the Territory of the Bishop of Minden, endeth at Vueser. Hitherto Westfalia, above which lies the County of Walda, and further off Hessen, under the Landgrave, by the Rhine, and the Bishoprick of Paterborn, by the Vueser. Which doth not acknowlenge the Arch-Bishoprick of Colen, spoken of before; but that of Mentz, for her Metropolitan. Now, if we should go to the Palatinate of the Rhine, Frankenland, Thuringen, and Brunswick, I shall interrupt the order of Af∣fairs, without any just or reasonable cause for the same, and therefore to return. The first breach of peace, at present, was msde at Orseo. This Town lies upon the Rhine, above Bercke, upon the side of the Bank, next to Cleves, which the Enemy having for∣merly begun to fortifie, by reason of the conveniency of the place, they had scarce laid the Foundations, but they were forced to leave off again, the greatness of the charge, and their own dissentions hindering them; And fear of infamy made the Hollanders, that they would neither undertake, nor perform the same; But the Spanish General, when he had once resolved for the Town, together with his Officers, de∣bate of the right thereof against all force, and he prepares to cut off the Bolts and Barrs of the Gates, with an Axe. And now some joyn together, and carry Scaling-ladders which they brought in Carts, towards the Walls, when presently the trembling Townsmen set open the Gates. The Castle was kept by a sort of Souldiers, that were half Clowns new∣ly
listed, yet not so unexperienced in Rapine and plunder, is they were in matters of War, whom the rest of the Soul∣diers laughed at for their more vile Apparel, adorning their heads, not like their fellow Souldiers, but with parti-colour∣ed Feathers of strange Birds; whereupon, they nick∣named them Cock-feather Asinegoes. Mendosa by using delayes, drawing these fellows into a vain hope, at last, shewing them the Hangman, and a Halter, made them come and submit. And now Count Bucquoy having transported his Regiment over the Rhine: as also two other Spanish Regiments, and afterwards, almost half the Horse, at one and the same time. Orseo and Malsem, a Village lying over against it, were both by Mendosa's Command, begun to be fortified, though he had promised within five dayes to depart from thence: sending forth into the by-wayes, Souldiers to fetch Wood, wholopping and topping Trees, though never so far distant, would hardly abstain from taking Wood from the Houses: At first, it was thought safeguard enough, for the Garison to make a firm passage over the River, but af∣terwards, they receded from that Counsel: While these things were a doing, and Frederick viewed all the Skirts of Germany, whereever he came, whether among Subjects, or Enemies; the violence and cruelty of the Spanish Army, did not onely cast a great terrour among the naked and un∣armed People, but by various Reports of the vulgar, as is usual in War, but much perplexed also the Ʋnited States, so that they mistrusted their Borders, and were unsatisfied of their more inward Garrisons. The Prince, who was preparing, as well to meet as pre∣vent this terrour, at the first news of their motion, calling together his Souldiers, that were quartered in the inner parts of the Country, especially the English and Scotch; to whom likewise came part of the Garrison-Souldiers from the Brill, and Flushing: he marched to Aynheym, whither also hast∣ned
those Regiments of Foot, and the Horse, under the Con∣duct of Count William of Frizeland; But the Ships of War that were to come thither, being hindred by cross Winds, were somewhat late ere they arrived. Soon after, going to take a view of Gravewaert, from thence passed to the Terri∣tory of Zutphen, and the Towns of Over-Issell, and to all of them, being either afraid of the Enemy, or hoping, and desi∣rous to defend themselves against him, he imparted an ad∣dition of strength out of his own Souldiers; But the rest of the places, were taken care of by their particular Gover∣nours: But Doesburg, and Doetichem, from whence, was the next passage out of Germany, to the Issell, on the right side of the Isle of Holland, the Prince himself especially, minded going thither with some Horse; There was he met by his Aunt, the Mother of the Counts Heremberge, who, with a great and Noble Train of her Daughters, after Salutes past, and Complements ended, intreated him by all the tyes of blood and allyance, and by his own fortune, by which alone he had seen his nearest Relations divided in the War, his Brother being on one part, and her Husband on another, that he would as much at he could, by the Laws and Rule of War, spare their Possessions. To which purpose, the works about Herenberg, should be thrown down, and the Garison withdrawn. (This Herenberg is a Town of Zutphen, from whence the Family of the Counts Herenberg take their Title) and by the same example, other Towns and Castles that were likely to fall into the Enemies hands, were likewise dismantled, and so as was hoped, redeemed from the mise∣ries and mischiefs of War. They fell to Consultation, where they should pitch their Camp; for in regard, it appeared unsafe, to incamp about Bercks, least the Enemy interpo∣sing himself between them and the adjacent Towns, to binder them from Provision, should cut off their Army, which indeed was much inferiour to the Enemy: Where∣fore, the Prince thought fit to possess himself of a little
Island, that lay on the right hand of the Hollanders, not far distant from the division of the River, and the further Bank of the Rhine, where the Dutchy of Cleves, winding about the Town of Sevenaer, sets bounds to the Jurisdiction of Zut∣phen: On both sides, they had Bridges made of Boats, for the more commodious passage over the River, as well of their great Guns, as their Horse. And as soon as the dan∣ger was gathered all together into one part, the rest of their fears vanished, so that now the Souldiers were called from Ostend, Nimmeghen, and the furthest parts of Holland and Zeland, to supply the want of those Forces, whereof the Army had been drained by the Garrisons. These were brought to the Prince by Count Hohenlo, whose diligence and labour was very remarkable, in furnishing all the Cities of Over-Issell, while the Enemy lay every where scattered among them, with great Guns, Engines of War, and all other necessary things for the defensive part, and beating off an Assaylant near at hand, or at a distance. Then the Prince sup∣posing it necessary to be provided against all imminent Oc∣currences, by knowing what number of men he had with him, upon muster of his Army, he found, that he had fifteen hundred Horse, and scarce six thousand Foot, too small a number publikely to meet the Enemy in the Field with, yet sufficient to repel them, yea, and fight with them upon occasion, where they might be helped by the Policy of the General, and advantage of time and place; And therefore understanding by some Prisoners, that Mendosa's Provisions were coming to the Town of Geldres, he made hast back with some Troops, and the chief Officers of the Army to the Maes, in hope of intercepting the Enemies Relief, and Con∣vey, between Venloo and Moers; But the River being passed, the Spanyards first suspecting, afterward learned the design, and so escaped the danger. Thus being disappointed, they every one went to follow their Commands at their own Re∣giments: Now there began some Skirmishes upon the Ri∣vers,
by the more then ordinary confidence of some few runawayes, who being brought in a Carriage-Boat, should, as if it were by chance, strike against a long Boat of the Hol∣landers, lying upon the watch at Rees, and so overwhelm it with Darts. In this Interim, the Spanish Army every day increased more and more, by the new coming of fresh forces, inso∣much, that now their multitude became burdensom to them∣selves, while they devoured all the Provision that could be brought to them far and wide, besides what came from Colen, and the Neighbouring Towns; by which means, Provision grew very dear, which happened not through any want that there was thereof, but from the Souldiers want of pay; and as evils seldom go alone, this dearness of Provision in the Spanish Army, was waited on by a plundering of the Fields and Vil∣lages about Ments, and other parts of Germany, that border upon the Rhine, but their malice was chiefly vented upon those who were averse, or seemed Enemies to the Roman Ca∣tholick Religion. This was the beginning of Rapine and plundering, and if either the Souldiers of the place, or the youth of the Coun∣try, offered to resist their injurious extortions, there was no more then a word and a blow, which was the cause of many promiscuous slaughters; yet could not the Souldiery be kept within their obedience, for all this liberty they took to themselves; but sometimes falling into extravagant de∣mands of money, as if they had been weary of idleness, or ti∣morous blood, would turn their madness, either against their Captains or Companions, so that Mendosa himself could hardly so interpose, as to pacific the Walloons and Spaniards, fallen together by the ears, in a sudden tumult, but that they would even before the Generals Tent, have encounters even to blood-shed, and spoil their Captains, even in his sight: Besides, the Noblemen differed in Counsel, out of envy one to another.
Lewis Velasco, General of the Ordnance, undertook to drive Prince Maurice, out of his Station, and boasted, that after he had so done, he would harasse all along the Rivers Issell and Rhine, and further, that he would magnificently, and like a Souldier, pierce into the very bowels of the Hol∣landers Country. Count Heremberg, passing to the right hand, marched a safer way as far as the Eemes, taking easie possession of a Country, where there were no Forces to resist him: or else, as if because he had known the Country, he had as it were, come thither to challenge the Prince to fight; and because he did not meer him, studied nothing but revenge in their daily spoils: And this might be believed the Reason, why his Son being at that time in the Army, was called the Transa∣matian Count. Of all which things, the Prince being informed as well by intercepted Letters, as by Intelligence of some Souldiers that were come over from them to him, admo∣nished the City of Embden of the danger, wishing them to be very vigilant in their own defence. Now began grievous complaints every day to be made at the Duke of Cleves Court, the Rulers of Moers envying the Spaniard, and with doleful outcryes, beseeching the Go∣vernours or Officers of the Army, to intreat Mendosa on their behalf, that he would let them have some ease and respite, though not in peace, and the enjoyment of their own, which because they had lost by their sluggishness and cowardise, they were ready forthwith to leave their Families, desert their Country, and freely go with them, being stronger then themselves, onely they requested, that their Wives and Chil∣dren might be permitted to leave that antient Seat of their Fathers, that they might not be slaves to the vilest of the Spaniards, and be unworthily vexed with contumelious words, and scornful behaviour, whereas otherwise they would not enjoy their liberty, though to that purpose they lived in banishment: which things were very grievously taken by
those that hoped better things, or else had been of Counsel with the Spaniards; for they who had the chief Authority, being hated by the Protestants, did voluntarily call in the Spanish Forces, to keep in awe the dissentors: They who were more simply honest, would take a Journey to the Rhine, al∣ledging, that in a short time, those miseries would be over; and in the interim, they must be excused, as being customary among Souldiers; for the revenging of small evils, is but a provocation to greater; That in a short time, the whole World would be inslamed into a general War: if they should run to Arms upon every slight offence of their Neigh∣bours, and some take part upon one side, and some on ano∣ther; Hereto were added Albertus his Letters, wherein he answered with much humanity, Sybilla the Duke of Cleves. Sister, setting forth the necessity that compelled him at the present, to do so many injuries, but for the future protesting, that as soon as the Rebels were conquered, that peace and se∣curity should be restored to the Duke her Brother, equally with himself. But notwithstanding, all these fair speeches, his Souldiers growing every day worse and worse, the Nobi∣lity, Governours, and Deputies of Cities, were commanded to meet in the City of Cleves: The Dukes name was onely used for a shew, for as well his own as others miseries, were concealed from him, least his disease should be increased thereby. But his Sister Sybilla, being a Woman of a Masculine Spirit and Prudence, sometimes spoke to them all, other∣whiles, to some particular persons, not for encreasing the Princes Revenues, nor to dispute about settlement of their Borders, but to stand up in defence of their liberty and Con∣sciences, which were at once in danger: where∣fore they should awake, and, while they had time, seek for remedies, they should go and consult to∣gether for the common good; and thus oftentimes,
with tears in her eyes, she wrought pity and compassion in her hearers: Whereupon laying aside all private animosi∣ties and discords, it was decreed, That the chief of the Ci∣ties being stengthened with Souldiers that should be speedi∣ly raised, they should on all hands go to get what strength they could together for their defence. All Germany is divided into ten parts, which they call Circles, five Superiour, and five Inferiour. The first of the three inferiour contains three Bishopricks, whose Bi∣shops are three of the seven Electors of the Empire, and have under their dominions, three free Cities, Mentz, Try∣us, and Colen; within this also is the Palatinate, whose Prince is another of the Electors, besides divers other less dominions. The second is Westfalia, which we have described before, wherein are the Princes of Cleves, Frizeland beyond the Eemes, and Walda, with many Bishopricks. The third and fourth contained Saxony: And in that part that comprehends Misnia, and Lusatia, are the Duke of Saxony, and Marquess of Brandenburgh, two more of the Electors: the Duke of Pomerania, Anhalt, and many other Princes, and some Ci∣tyes; herein are the Archbishops of Breme, and Madge∣brg, and five other lesser Bishops: Besides the Dukes of Holsatia, Brunswick, Londari, and Luneburg, and many Ci∣ties by the Baltick Sea; In the last, which is called Burgun∣dy, is the Bishop of Besancon: And to his Jurisdiction, Duke Charles appointed that part of the Netherlands under his o∣bedience. Every Division hath a selected Governour who with some assistants dispatcheth all affairs of inferiour qua∣lity, but calls a Council to determine the more weighty. At that time Simon Count of Luppe had the charge of Westfalia, whom then the Lords of Cleves desired to demand Moers from Mendosa, and in case it should be refused, that he would call a Council of the five inferiour divisions at Dort∣mund, and in the mean time retaining the Souldiers that should go to Hungary with the Turkish tributes prevent a
danger at home, rather then a fear at so great a distance. Not were they that were sent to the Emperor more backward to importune him with prayers; and in like manner were sol∣licited all the Bishops resident about the Rhine, as also the Count Palatine, the Landgrave of Hessen, and the Duke of Brunswick, who all for fear the same evil should at one time or another creep towards them, were ready to be drawn into a league of defence: And the Colonians were dehorted, that they should no more serve the Spaniards with provisions, least thereby they seemed to encourage them in their design of common ruine. Some also were commanded to go to Prince Maurice, and to return him thanks, that he had hitherto main∣tained the war with so little damage to the borderers, and to desire him to proceed to convince the enemyes abominable villanyes with his valour and vertuous actions, and that he would not take in ill part any injuryes that should be done to him or his unwillingly, but rather that he would look upon them with an eye of pity and mercy, hoping that he would rather revenge himself upon the authors and causers of the injury, then the patience of a weak people; That they ho∣ped it would be acceptable, both to Himself and the States, because formerly they had fought it; that since the Laws were in vain, and the Spaniards insolence was increased by impunity, the Germans would now joyn in arms with him: and they said, That since they were compelled to deliver all that they held in the German soyl, they were promised that the Spaniards should be forced to do the same, if they would not do it voluntarily; which since it had not been perfor∣med, and that rewards were given to injurious oppression, and modesty used with conmely, so that Albertus, the author of so great mischiefs, was by many designed to be heir of the Empire; that goodness of theirs which had been so often eluded, should now one way or other compel the enemy to wish they had rather have done equal kindness, then only to feed them with empty words: And if the Germans would
at last understand what they had so often by experience found, after so many acts of hostility done by the Spaniards, they would never find a more opportune season to joyn with their neighbours and friends, justly to subvert their encroa∣thing tyranny, then now, that old King Philip was dead, and the Army was full of discord and poverty. But Mendosa re∣turned answer to those sent to him, That it was usual so to do, when rebels could not be otherwise repressed, nor would be intreated to give a better answer. Nay, he proceeded so far in the contempt of Justice, that he would not vouchsafe to inquire what might be pretensively said, either from the Antients, or at present for the Austrians against them of Cleves. In the interim, the Spaniards were daily more and more afflicted with fresh mischiefs, themselves suffring what they indeavoured to inflict upon others, for on this side the Rhine, by continual Rapines, all the fruits of the ground were consumed, the husbandmen driven away, and the woods felled, so that the Countrey far and wide was in a manner left naked, nor did provisions come to the Camp as is usual, because they that brought it, were so often pillaged, and hence proceeded great famines among them, which made the Souldiers daily run away, not by one and one at a time, but by whole Companies in a day, some of which intending to go to the Moselle. Mendosa sent some horse after them to bring them back, whom they saluted so discourteously, that they were glad to return without doing what they were commanded. There was another accident also that increa∣sed their penury, which was this, The Rhine being very rough with tempestuous winds, had broken their bridg of Boats, the ignorance of the Smiths having not well fastned them to the banks, so that by this means their commerce was cut off from one another. Mendosa admonished by this in∣convenience, certainly decreed the Siege of Bergh, which before this time they had but threatned; and this he did, be∣cause the Island there, the Blockhouses upon the River, the
firm passage; and the rest were not kept without loss and infamy, the possession of all which might be more justly, and with less trouble reteined by the title of a victorious Con∣quest: and therefore it was much admired, that he defer∣red this care above a moneth, while the enemies were weak and far distant, unless by that delay he sought a more spe∣cious pretence to stay in those parts, for which now a suita∣ble occasion presented it self, because the States being often required to redeliver Bergh, would neither surrender it as a∣nothers, nor fortify it as their own. At the beginning of the year, the Archbishop of Colen reiterated his demands of restitution, by John of Nassaw, the son of John, protesting the equity thereof in very friendly words; so answering the pretence of charges, which was the States only Argument, that he said they were the first that usurped upon the City, whose example the Spaniards followed, yet they had often promised they would leave it, until at length they continued their delayes so long, that they were prevented from per∣formance by a Siege; but if they expected to be repaid their charges of the war, and their damages, there is nothing more just, than that every one should vindicate and maintain their own. And if he should be permitted to reckon no∣thing for Hay which he returned, how much more unreaso∣nable is it for any man to interpose his authority in accounts of war? Besides, he shewed that the town was only a bur∣then and charge to them that kept it, and would not be con∣venient for the Enemy, for that the River could be passed more commodiously in other places; which principally mo∣ved the United States, in a Council of the Provinces held to that purpose, to weigh the great distance of the place, the poverty of the Souldiers, and the extream labour in fortify∣ing it: And although they discoursed no more of charges, yet it pleased them, being even out of hopes to keep it, to think that by the surrender of it they should get somewhat more then thanks: And therefore they answered, That they
had often found, that whatever they gratified their friends withall, had become a booty to the Enemy; Wherefore they hoped it would be no injury, if they did faithfully pro∣mise, that they would not in a hostile manner invade any part within the bounds of Germany, nor do any act to disturb the trade or passage of or upon the Rhine: And if any thing were done to the contrary, that the said Bishop of Colen, and the other Electors about the Rhine, should appoint and order how, and what satisfaction should be made for the same: He on the other side requiring stricter conditions, when an A∣greement was almost concluded, would proceed no further, as knowing the Spaniards were preparing a revenge, whom he was suspected to have stirred up to deal in other matters controverted between himself and the Princes of Germany. By reason of this kind of treaty before mentioned, the Hol∣landers had scarcely any time to prepare for a defence of the Town, before the danger was ready to fall upon it. There∣fore the enemies army lying all about the Rhine, it was too e to think of fortifying, and besides the evils they were a∣ware of, there was another happened whereof they never had a thought; for the Pestilence beginning within the small compass of the place, on a sudden, burst out more violently in a furious contagion and wonderful slaughter. The cause of this sorrow was beleived to proceed at that time from the unusual dryness of the Rhine, for the very channel lying with∣out water, had infected the Ayr with thick vapours, which also by the unseasonableness of the foregoing Autumn had been corrupted; from thence sprung so great an infection among the people, that whoever was touched therewith, was forthwith shut up from all humane society. And of the Souldiers left in the garrison, who had scarcely any victuals, nor a safe place to hide their heads in, scarce six hundred men remained alive of a far greater number: Nor were their bodies more wasted by the Plague, then their minds were afflicted with the misery of so sad a spectacle. The
Governour of the place, by name Seafy, lying also sick of this terrible disease, receiving Letters from Mendosa, only writ back this, That the surrender of the Town was unseasonably mentioned, because the States had lately made Articles for the de∣livery thereof to the Archbishop of Colen. By the modesty of this answer, the Spanyard presently conceived rash hopes of treachery; wherefore he sent other Messengers, and by them offered great rewards both to him and his wife. In this inte∣rim, the Prince suddenly commanded three Companyes of Foot to march by Land, because the winds had taken away the use of the River, and their often being sent, and as fre∣quent return, though still to no purpose, had made the Ene∣my negligent; these three Companies were to guard and keep the Island, that was hard by, but not to mingle with the infected multitude of the town, unless upon fatal neces∣sity. The Fortifications of this Island were very weak, and the enemy prevented them in perfecting their design, pene∣trating on every side the thin rampire with the bullets of the Artillery which he had brought thither. And at the same time, some horse, where the River ran more slow, got over at a ford, so that now danger was come even to their posts, when by the command of the Governour, the new Souldiers being brought over (some great Guns and small shot being disposed about the rampire of the Town, by whose defence) the very last of them got safe into Bergh, leaving behind some fire secretly to burn their huts. And now Mendosa, that the Enemy might not be able to interrupt the siege, put garrisons into divers Towns of the Dutchy of Cleves lying below Bergh. Many submitted voluntarily; but the Inhabitants of Burick, dating at first to oppose the empty name of peace to the violence of war, he quickly made submit by setting fire to their gate; Souldiers also were thrust into Alpen and Moers, although this belonged to Nienarius his Widow, and that to the Widow of the Palatine, to both whom, Albertus had given his faith, That they should not be disturbed by the
War: But the like happened to more besides themselves▪ Covenants and Promises being of no value, where all Laws are trodden under foot. About this time, the Ayr was very Cloudy, which much forwarded the Besiegers, so that in short time, they ap∣proached near the Town in three places; yet for all that, were not come to the Trench. And now some Guns being planted, both in the Island and Continent, threatned from thence a continual Battery. At which time, Alfonso Avales, commanding the Horse, and Chief in managing the Siege, according to the Military Custom, sent a Herald. The Townsmen advise'd, that leave should be desired, of sending a Messenger to the Bishop, but the Souldiers disliked of that, as being a palpable confession of fear, but sent back a reso∣late answer, being angry also at this, that he should send to the Governour, as inferiour to him, because in greater Com∣mand. Soon after this, an Assault was made by the Spaniard, upon the outward Bulwark; but they were beaten off vali∣anily, and that with so much the greater slaughter, by how much they came on rashly, without any Advise or Conduct. But when the Coping of the Wall began to be battered, (a strange thing to tell.) A Tower looking to the Water, (wherein was a great quantity of Gunpowder sufficient to serve a long time) which taking fire on a sudden (like a Clap of Thunder and Light∣ning) it burst out with a horrible Crack, vemiting fire and smoak, overthrew all before it; They that enquired into the cause thereof, report, that one of the Enemies Bullets striking either against a stone, or another piece of Iron made fie fly out, the sparks whereof, falling among the Gunpowder, caused that mis∣chance; By that violent ebullition of the fire the Ayr was wholly purified from its Pestilential Infection; but more grievus evils succeeded in the place: For by the blow, many of the adjoyning Houses were overthrown several People killed in the ruines: part of the Bulwark utterly demolisht, which the battery of many Cannons could not have effected; and if a Half Moon standing
out beyond that place, had not hindred the Enemy from seeing them: so much had that unexpected Casualty taken away the use of their understanding that the Town might have been entred by force, before they could have, been provided, either to make re∣sistance, or capitulate, Eor great quantities of Stones were vio∣lently hurled up into the Ayr, and fell down into the Enemies Camp, killing and hurting divers therein; yea, and half  hour after the great blow, divers Ships in the Rhine were indan∣gered by the furious concussion of the Waves, which made the River seem white, as if it had been covered with Snow. But within the Town, when as any one durst go into the vacuities, there they found, (what was enough to astonish mens Ears in the hearing, and to make their Eys drop tears in the seeing) torn and dismembred Bodies, Heads, Arms, Legs, and other parts scat∣tered over the whole place. But as often as the ruined Bulwarks went to be repaired, and the dust and rubbish was carryed away, what ever re∣mained, let the difference be what it would, every one thought it to be his own, if once it came to his hands; for now they would be governed, neither by Counsel nor Com∣mand; for Luke Heddingen, to whom the Government was devolved by the death of Scafius lay among others, killed in the ruines of the collapsed Walls and Houses; by all which accidents, the People were so possessed with fear, that the Enemy perceiving it, offered them their lives, upon condition onely, that they should not fight against them within four moneths, although he was not ignorant, how little he wanted of the Victory. And he was so much more favourable to them, and more obseviert of his promise, ha∣ving a just cause of War against them, than he was towards those whom he called friends: It was believed, that Avales retained this kindness, in remembrance of the Battel of Knodsenburg, where he himself was taken prisoner by the Hollanders, and generously used. The fifth day, the Siege was ended, and Prince Maurice,
being deceived of his hope, for that he imagined, that Siege would have made the Enemy spend the greatest part of the next Winter there, yet could not find justly any thing Name-worthy, besides the multiplyed mischances of unkind fortune, and his own Forces, who would suffer him to at∣tend nothing but the defence of the Borders. While these things were transacting in these places, ano∣ther part of the Spanish Army, passing over the Rhine, sate down against Urseo, and with an unprofitable pride, scorning the Redemption the Country offered for their Lands, made clandestine incursions, more like Thieves than Souldiers, into the furthest part of Zutphen, and some part of Over-Issel, wasting those places, where although they committed no great spoyl, but among the Germans, who lay mingled there∣abouts, though they got not much plunder, yet they lost good store of blood, which made them rage without measure, or mercy, shewing many examples of their blood-thirstiness, against the Towns lying up the Luppe and Roer: But all these promiscuous slaughters of the vulgar, and the infinite number of their horrid villanies, were all darkened, obscured, and seemed as nothing, to that one barbarous Murther commit∣ted upon a Person of Honour; It was Viricus Falcsteyne, Count of Brucke (the name seems to hint to us the name of the Bruckeri) who agreed with the Hollanders in point of Religion, and in the Counsel of their Nation constantly op∣posed all such as spoke any thing in the behalf of the Spanish faction. He had with him a hundred Souldiers, and as many Boors, or rather more, with whom he undertook the defence of a weak Castle, and many times drove away the Spaniards from their spoyling of the Country by the fear of him, and sometimes with slaughter: Therefore being commanded to yield up his Guard, when relying upon the validity of the German Laws be refused, and one Lopez being sent to the Siege, his Souldiers were so wearied with the length of their march, that they were unfit to fight,
Which he noting, prevented Extremity, by Articling for the preservation and safety of the Lives and Fortunes of himself and all his, who had been Reported to have bin many more in number, which it was thought was one Motive causing his death; for contrary to the Covenants agreed, the Castle was demolish'd, his Wife taken from him, his Souldiers all kill'd, and himself kept prisoner: where, having bin detain'd some days, he was invited to go abroad and take the fresh Air: One Peter Agayo had received the Command, to kill him; but to do it in such manner, as his Death might be imputed to accident. In his Walk he passed by the Ground, yet wet with the Bloud of his Souldiers, when they that guarded him, following behind as Waiters, the Executioners of Death first striking him with a Javelin, afterwards kill'd outright with their Swords, and they of his Familiars that were with him, underwent the same Fate: The Order of this Murther being publish'd abroad, the Friends and Kindred of the Count were all moved to Revenge; nay, and so bitter was the Peoples Indignation against it, that the Council of Ju∣liers, could not, or would not, pass it by in Silence. Whereto Mendosa gave very careless Answers, as believing it enough to deny his Knowledge or Command of the Fact, though he suffer'd it to go unpunish'd: Adding moreover, That it had not hapned, but by the Divine Providence, that he fell by War, who ought long before to have suffer'd for his publike Crimes of Sedition and Impiety; and much upbraiding his Obstinacy, accounting this also among his Faults, That he had as it were in Contempt, answer'd his Latine Letters in the German Tongue, of which he knew his (viz. Mendosa's) Ignorance: And then if any more grievous Accident had hapned, he com∣mended to them Patience; without which, he averred him∣self uncapable of Ruling a Multitude inraged with Poverty and Injury. But these Flouts, in Words, were attended with seriousness of Action.
One of the Noblest Towns in those parts beyond the Rhine, is Wesel, famous among the Dutch, both for Merchan∣dise and Arts, which were brought thither by the frequent Resort of Foreiners from other Countries, flying for their difference in Religion: That City supposing her self more oppressed than the rest, by having a Spanish Judge, had de∣termin'd, by an Honourable Legation, and some Gifts, to win upon the General's Mind; which he understanding, an∣swer'd, He was not such a one as could be induced or perswaded to let alone that, which was necessary to be done, or that knew not to do kindnesses to good People, unless moved thereto by the Allure∣ments of Gifts; but indeed there was no other way to merit his Favour, than by restoring the Publike Worship of God to its true and pristine condition, which would, in truth, be an act so lovely, and pleasing to him, that he would esteem it beyond many Gifts. Which Things were so spoken by him, because they of Wesel, having been often commanded by the General's Council, to receive the Romane Rites within their Walls, had obstinately refused it. And therefore the Spaniard, soon after passing the Rhine with his whole Army, commanded them to receive a great Garrison both of Horse and Foot, as their Neighbour Town of Burick had done; and withall to beware, That no∣thing were innovated in those Parts by the Enemy. But the Diffe∣rence was easily understood; for their Obedience drew a∣long with it an alteration in the State; and if they denyed, the Licentious Souldier, greedy of Prey, would scarcely be contained from the Assault and Spoil of the City. Where∣fore, seeking some means to appease the General, and avoid the Fury of his Anger, they sent him a great quantity of Corn, and, in Money, a Hundred Thousand Dollers; which Sum, was not raised out of the Tributes, but paid out of the Publike Treasury: Concerning the value of which, there grew a great Contention between the Souldiers and Citi∣zens, which had almost renewed their Danger; unless the Governours, on both sides, had moderated their inraged
Minds: With this Money, and what was gather'd otherwise in the Neighbouring Towns, and came from Bruxels, Men∣dosa perswaded the Army, That though they had refused it hi∣therto, that leaving some Garrisons on the hither Bank of the Rhine, they would suffer themselves to be led beyond the Rhine: From thence they passed the River Luppe, by a firm and strong Bridge, which they commanded them of Wesel to make; for that which was formerly made, the Materials whereof being Bundles of Hay bound up with Clay, and by the Artificers bestirring themselves, placed upon New Boats; as many such seem'd to do well, yet would serve for no use, so though singly they were passable enough, yet by reason of their inequality of Burden, many of them together were troublesome and dangerous: There it was thought fit, by the Opinion of Velasco, rather to pass the Issel, than to go so far from the Borders, now at the beginning of Winter, where they were not certain of Provision, and to lye about the wet and marshy Soil of Frizeland. In this March, they exacted from the People of Munster, both Money and Instruments of War, though the United States admonish'd them otherwise; assuring Them, That they should not expect any help or Peace from them, if the Enemy were augmented, either by their Assist∣ance, or Sluggishness. From thence, Rees and Emmerie, two Towns lying close by the Rhine, for Fear, accepted Garri∣sons; to whom Mendosa, at first, did not assign any great Number; but afterwards, utterly regardless of his Reputa∣tion, he daily violated his Promise in sending in more; as if he had taken a delight not to perform, what was in his own Power not to have promised. And the Towns-men of Rees could not have Liberty granted them of departing, when they desir'd it. But a Germane Captain, whom Mendosa had bound with an Oath to go into the Town of Emmeric with 400 Souldiers; and sending Barlatte after him with a Regi∣ment, because no more should come into his Quarters, he valiantly kept him out, openly protesting, That he would not
yet break his Faith and Paroll, by the unhandsome Example of his faithless General. This so great Contempt was very ill resented by the Town, which had always stuck close to the Romane Religion; and at the perswasions of the Jesuits, was, underhand, the main Author of calling the Spaniards into those Parts, as believing they should receive no damage by the War: And, as Wit∣nesses of Mendosa's Promise, when a Priest being sent out of the City, produced his Letters under his hand, reproving him thereby for his breach of Promise, he could get no other Answer, than that there was so much difference between the Af∣fairs of Princes, and those of Church-men, that it was not possible always to manage them by the same Counsels. To whom the Priest replyed, We shall not wonder hereafter why the Hollan∣ders Rebelled, and that they are so averse to make any Conditions with you, since measuring all Things for your own Advantage; you violate that Justice and Right to your Friends, which should be preserved unspotted even to your Enemies: Certainly, at last, those wicked Actions and Studies will not onely make you hated by Men, but draw upn your Heads the Vengeance of Heaven. But the Spaniard was so far from being moved with this free∣dom of speech, that immediatly he went and broke into Isel∣burg by force, with a great slaughter of the Citizens: The Town of Iselburg is situate more inward upon the Old Ri∣ver Issel. Among these Passages, the Prince, that he might stop the Enemy from coming to him, commanded some Pioneers to go into a Ship, and by cutting through the Bank near Emme∣ric, should let in the Rhine to overflow the whole Plain: And now all the Country about began to become a great Pool, when the Spaniards (on a suddain) came upon them; and first assaulting the Guard left with Count Hohenlo, with their shot, afterwards bringing their Artillery to the Bank, they drove them from the place; Then making up the Breach, the Waters also of their own accord abated. This Design thus
failing, Prince Maurice thought it necessary, to prevent the approaching Enemy, by seizing some places in the Dutchy of Cleves, which he had hitherto forborn, before the Enemy should take them; (for he was now about the Mountain Aelten) and, to this purpose, he went to Sevenaer, a Town in that part, and commanded the same to be deliver'd to him using great Threats to the Governour, That he should deny to him, what he would grant to the Enemy. In the same manner, were other Towns taken in the same Dominion, although they stood within the Isle of Holland; but, probably, the changing of the old course of the River, or mutual Agree∣ments of Princes, might alter the Bounds: These Towns were Huessen, and the Castle of Lobec, where all the Tribute of Cleves is kept; which place, the Authors of that Age re∣marked for the Name and impious Treachery of Herespich, by which Charles le Gross kill'd Godfrey, the Norman then Ruling the Frizons. But Mendosa fearing some Mauritian Stratagems from his Armies lying so near, kept his Souldiers under very strict Command: Ten whole Nights and Days did the Army continue in the open Field, without any other Coverture than the Canopy of Heaven; and taking no rest, but in their Order in Arms, and upon the Naked Earth: In∣somuch, that what with Cold and want of rest; and, at last, for that all the Provision of the Country round about was spent, and they durst not range abroad for Booty, they were afflicted with most pinching Hunger.The Infantry was made up of good Souldiers out of several Nations, aemulous among Themselves; but there was an Evil Custom grown invete∣rate by use among the Commanders, on the King's side, to put their main Confidence in the strength of their Horse; who, being at this time broken with Wants, and weakned with Fear, took away the Courage of others: So that often∣times, a few of the Nassauians pu to flight three times as many of their Enemies, getting very great Booties of Horses; yea, and the Common Souldiers were so ordinarily beaten,
that by reason of the Charge and Trouble of the great Num∣ber of Prisoners taken, (for many came willingly into Capti∣vity, merely that they might be able to satisfie their Hunger, and would not be Ransom'd) it was at last Decreed, That  one, from that time, should take any Prisoner alive: So that in all the time that the War remained about the Rhine, when the Prince, with a small Party of Horse, had a mind to view the States Enemies, or else in some select place would draw up his Army into Battalia, or at other times sent out any of his Officers to allure Them to some light Skirmishes of Horse, the Spaniard never either disturb'd his Camp by Assaults, or suffer'd himself to be drawn in, or involved into the Offer of a Fight: For it was the General's Prudence not to put Confidence, either in their Courage or Resolution, which were less corrupted by Licentiousness than Poverty, and this Prudence of the General nursed up the Souldiers in Cowardise; and if the Hollanders had not in all their Affairs looked upon their Dangers as it were through a multiplying Glass, they had had a noble Opportunity of making Attempts upon those great Forces of the Spaniards: But now when they were observed to quit the Bank of the Rhine, and to march directly towards Issel, Prince Maurice, at the very beginning, leaving the Guard of Holland, hasted away with the Ships, to prevent suddain danger; and that he might the more easily straiten the Enemy of Provisions, strengthning all the weaker places thereabouts, brought to Doesburg Bridges, Guns, Engines, and all other necessary Furniture for War. This Town lies within the Jurisdiction of Zutphen, and hath the River Issel coming out of Westfalia, brought thither by Ditches begun at Arnheym, which was supposed to be the antient Work of Drusus. In this place intending to stop the Enemies passage into the Voluwe, he pitch'd and fortified his Camp at the very meeting of the two Rivers. The Line that incompassed his Camp was 8 Foot high, near 40 Foot broad.
At the Top it bore 24 Foot, besides a Coping higher than the rest 6 Foot, and round about the whole was a deep Trench: Besides this, there was another Line more inward, but nor erected according to the modern way of Fortifica∣tion; which, for hastning the Work, was to be a Second to the adjoyning Bulwark. While this was doing, Mendosa bat∣ter'd Doetechem, a Town also in Zutphen Jurisdiction, which is an hours Journey from Doesburgh, and the 3d day he came to the Trench, without sending any Summons, accord∣ing to the Custom of War, choosing rather to terrifie the Besieged with Danger than Threats; as confident, by that Example, after the first bloud drawn, it would not be refused: Yet it is believed, that the Interest of Frederick Count Hi∣remberg, procur'd the Surrender of it; the Souldiers, upon delivery, being disarm'd, and commanded not to bear Arms, during the space of 6 Moneths, out of Holland or Zeland; and the Townsmen having free Pardon and Impunity, after 20 years continuing faithful to the States, were now first compell'd to change their Masters, with this one small Vi∣ctory. After Bergh, the course of the King's. Army was stopped, acknowledging their Errour, That they had not at first, without Delay, fallen upon Doesburg, which they thought would have yielded presently, if Prince Maurice, taking time by the Fore-lock, had not come thither himself, and by his Policy prevented them. And this was all worthy of Note done by these great Forces, being hindred to proceed further, either by the Season of the Year, or shortness of Time and Provi∣sions; their Want being so great, that many Runaways from them affirme. They had not tasted a bit of Bread in five days; by which Extremity of Hunger, and feeding on un∣wholesom Victuals, Diseases did so increase, that in a short time above 7000 Men were lost and dead. The News whereof coming to the Deputy Regent Cardinal Andrew of Austria, and Commands from him received, They consult to go and Winter in Germany with he whole Army.
The Spaniards had oftentimes done many things impiously, and without shame or modesty; but they never before so highly contemned the Censures and Judgments of Men, as that they would not endeavour to palliate their Wickedness with some pretence: But this one Thing will excuse the In∣jury so openly done by publike Council, viz. They supposed no man so innocent, but that ought rather to perish, than suf∣fer his Affairs to be brought into hazard: For this is evident, If so many Regiments of Foot, and Troops of Horse, or in∣deed more truly, so great a Company of Seditious Persons, pinched with Poverty, should remain in the Netherlands, it were much to be fear'd, that together with this New Em∣pire, they would introduce Old Examples of Defection and Rebellion: Wherefore Mendosa leading back his Army, took the Castle of Sculenberg, which done, he took leave of the States Borders. The Prince follow'd his departure upon the Track, not so much glorying before in his Works, as he did then that he had defended his Country, which Honour great Captains used to seek, before they looked for Triumphs and Mural Crowns: It pleased him to view the Situation of their empty Camp, and the unperfect Works of the starved Enemy: But it was a sad Spectacle to behold in what Num∣bers the Sick and Wounded lay scatter'd every where, who being deserted by the Army, were left to the pityless Inju∣ries of the Air and Weather, besides the want of all Things else. These Enemies, of whom their own Friends took no pity, he caused to be refreshed with Victuals; for Octayola, that was by Mendosa left at Doetichem, being summon'd by a He∣rald from the Prince, That he would assist those miserable Wretches, and take them into Coverture, returned an Answer, more like a Souldier than a Man, That within those Walls, there was room onely for sound and healthful Bodies. Then after some small Horse Fights, and the taking of Count Bucquoy, in which Affairs, Lewis of Nassaw principally had the Con∣duct,
Prince Maurice came to Arnheym, laying up there all the Provisions of War for the Year following, which shew'd him very judicious in his foresight, because from thence he could easily supply all the Towns round about in time of Danger, both with Victuals and Arms. But before he dis∣missed his Forces, understanding that the City of Emmeric did very impatiently bear the Yoke of Spanish Slavery, sent Count Hohenlo to regain the same by Force of Arms and Bat∣tery from Mendosa, who then Winter'd hard by in Rees, taking no Care to send any Relief to his men in distress, be∣cause the Bank of the Rhine being digg'd through, had so overflow'd the Ways, that he believ'd they could not have passed; Emmeric retaken, the Prince thought not sit to put a Garrison into it; but by the Advice of his Council it was left, that by the Example thereof, he might cause the Enemy to be more envyed. With the same hope Sevenaer, in the Dutchy of Cleves, was quitted by the Prince: From thence going to the Hague, together with the Senate, according to Custom, he advised the States of each Province, that there was need of a greater Army; wherefore he hoped they would provide in greater measure Money for the Souldiers Pay, and other extraordinary Charges, for that the Enemy lay now more heavy upon one part, and that they should re∣scind all prejudicial Procrastinations: Accounting all other Necessities as nothing, in regard of that one for their De∣fence. At this time there were many famous Funerals celebra∣ted in those Provinces: Florence Palante Count of Culenburg, formerly accounted among the chief Commanders of the Nobility, that conspired against the Inquisition; but after∣wards being found unfit for that Charge, and of himself de∣sirous to take his ease, grew old, and almost unknown to those Factions, which he himself had been the first Author of. But Philip Aldegunde led a more notable private Life, whom, whoever had seen inseparable from the Prince of Aurange,
and governing Cities and People, would have admired to find him afterwards retired to a studious Repose, even to his death. But certainly, Elberte Leoninus at first brought under the shadow of Learning, and before the Peace made at Gaunt, a publike Minister of the King's Party, then Chief Justice, and of the Publike Council of Gelders, in which Em∣ployment he dyed: A Man that attained by Nature, what the Precepts of the Old Philosophers dictated, and was so free from all passionate Fancy, that he follow'd Parties, not out of Affection, because they were so, but because he found them so. 'Tis a strange Thing to relate, with what Flagitious Acts Mendosa's Army filled Germany, the Towns being assaulted and forced without any difference; their readiness to resist being so gotten, in the Confidence they had of their long-continued Peace. At the same time the Country People, in hope of getting to a place of Refuge fled; but their collect∣ed Wealth made them become both a more rich and easie Prey to those Russianly Plunderers. The Fields were wasted enough in their very Passage, so that in some places they proved barren the Year following, because they were worn out at that time, when they ought to have been sowed. No less uncivil and Treacherous was their seizure of several Ca∣stles held by the Noble-men, which till that time had been Fautors of the Spaniards in all their wicked Actions. The be∣ginning of their Rapines was committed upon the People of Munster, and the Borders of Brentheym; which places not be∣ing sufficient for the Support and Maintenance of their For∣ces, Reclinhusen, a place belonging to the Bishop of Colen, situate between the Rivers Luppe and Roer, was added, where Velasco took the City of Dorst, by a violent Assault thereof, in a Warlike manner, with his Canon; which Contu∣melious Act the Colonian Bishop taking no Notice of, made all his Subjects imagine, that it was so done and suffer'd by private Agreement among Them. Hence, the Evil spread
further to the People of Mons and Marchia, until it reached both sides of the Dutchy of Cleves, and there oppressed many Cities, which at their first coming they had not medled with: Others were forced to purchase Freedom at a great Rare, among which the City of Cleves it self, the principall Seat of the infirm Duke: In which places, they got so great Booty, that the very Common Souldiers Treated with Mer∣chants of Colen, to return great Sums of Money for them to Antwerp. This their Covetousness at first, sprung from Pride, and was afterwards increased by Cruelty; insomuch, that con∣temning the parsimonious living of the Boors, they command∣ed those ignorant People to provide for them dear, and far∣fetched Dainties, and all other Provocatives of Luxury and Riot. And if any were backward, in performing their un∣reasonable Commands, or seemed either to hide or convey away their Wealth, they were beaten and tormented in that barbarous manner, that sometimes they were maimed in their Lims; otherwhiles, Incisions made into their Flesh; nay, and some were scorched and half burned alive; not for∣bearing these frightful Terrours and Punishments to Wo∣men great with Child, and young Infants: Of which Barba∣risms, and innumerable Murthers, the Germans publish'd di∣vers Examples, attested by the Credit of many worthy and known Persons. And if the Villany of these Wretches had stopped here, there might yet have been some pretence made by them; but as if those forementioned Crimes, had been too little, they spared not the Houses of Noble Persons but vio∣lated also the Sacred Societies of Holy Virgins, who had wholly dedicated Themselves to the Service of God: Raging moreover, with such an unrestrained Lust, that they spared not immature and tender Virginity; and if the Womens Chastity deluded their Hopes, their Husbands were produc'd and made a laughing stock, to command their own disho∣nour; yea, and Mothers compelled to bring forth and prosti∣stitute
their Daughters: These were the Deeds of a People professing Peace, which the most inraged Victor hardly at∣tempted, I am sure never defended in the heat of War: And it is hardly to be believed, how negligently and remissly that Nation (which had been the Conquerour of others) and so earnest in the Defence of Liberty, took these Things: But besides a long Peace, which usually effeminates the most Manly Minds, here was discover'd the imperfection of that Government, that is divided into many Hands; not onely in the Difficulty of their Meetings in Council, but in their Difference of Affections, which is most frequent among Them, by reason of Emulation. And this certainly was, that the Spaniards would have wished; nor was his Endeavour therein wanting, that Mat∣ters should not be ended at One, but deferred from Coun∣cil to Council. In the interim, not one scarcely daring to Repel an Injury done him because the Publike Management of War, for the General Vindication, was delayed, onely Count Oldenburg, the Bishops of Breme and Osnaburg, and Count John of Nassaw, being a little further distant, slighted the Threats of the Tumultuary Souldier, whereof they had Notice; whose Examples were afterwards safely follow'd by all those fur∣ther Parts. But for the Dutchy of Cleves, and their Neighbours of Westfalia, there was no other help, than those of Prayers and Letters: Which made Charles Nutselius, whom the Emper∣our had sent to settle and order the Affairs of Cleves, to de∣test the Persidy and dishonourable Dealings of the Austri∣ans, because he saw, that under the Protection and by the Connivence of King Philip, and the Arch-Duke Albertus, who pretended Themselves Vindicators of the Romane Reli∣gion, such abominable and unparallel'd Villanies were com∣mitted, against the Laws of Nature and Mankind, and against all Bonds and Covenants.
The Duke of Lorain said no less, whose Daughter was mar∣ryed to the Duke of Cleves, and his Son to the King of France his Sister; protesting, That he would not desert his Relations, nor would be deserted by them. But from Rodolphus, being by Nature given to delay, and now either for fear or grief hiding himself, that he could not be spoken with, other then by Letters; although the Westfa∣lians, and other Princes, living about the Rhine, at their Re∣quest, daily sollicited not onely himself, but his Ministers of State intrusted by him; yet could they obtain nothing but empty Words, and fruitless Embassies: Hereupon Albertus then being at Millain, and Cardinal Andrew at Bruxels, instead of answering, attributed the Causes of all these Evil, together with the beginnings of the War, and the denial of making Peace to that time, to the Rebels; and whensoever any Exorbitancies were objected against them, which they could not deny, they called it a short Extremity, whereto they were compelled by Necessity. But Mendosa was more insolent; who, the more plausibly to shun Obedience to his Masters Command, denyed, That he Warred for the King; and that he would neither be danted with the Noise of great Names, or frighted with cruel Threats, or driven out by any other means than force of Arms: Adding moreover, That if either Caesar or Germany durst have confi∣ded in his Men, they might have used them, when Bonne and Berck were held by the Hollanders. He often boasted himself an Enemy to all Lutherans, and that he was sent into those Parts from Heaven, to revenge the Impieties there so often and so long perpetrated. And now had the Germans seen the Spanish Ensigns display'd in their Country little less then four Moneths, when, at the very end of the Year, one Decree was sent by the Emperour to Mendosa, another to the States. Against him were objected many and grievous Things: To Them that they had occupyed some few places at the Divi∣sion of the Rhine, and breaking into the Jurisdiction of Mun∣ster,
had led away certain Priests, Captive: and therefore they were both commanded to depart out of the Jurisdiction of Germany, to make Reparation for the Rapines, and other Damages there done, to release all Prisoners, and, for the fu∣ture, to abstain from oppressing others; and this under the Penalties therein contained, as if they still offended in the like. The Eighth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. THE Spaniards Minds were so obdurated with daily Complaints, that at the same time that the Emperour's Herald, and the Lorrain Embassadors publikely accused them for their former Crimes, they afresh batter'd; and by the Ruine of the Gate, not without bloud, took Calcar, a City of Cleves, professing the Roman Religion, which had refused to admit Souldiers of its own Jurisdiction, but as a Winter Garrison; Goch also, a Town in the same Jurisdiction, was subdued by Force of Battery: But Gency, and Santern, were permitted to redeem Themselves from their Fear with Mo∣ney. He boasted with so much pertinacy his Hatred to Lu∣theranism, and Calvinism, That he commanded the Bishop of Patelborn, and others, to purge their Lands from such noxious Vermine; and if they neglected to do it, that his Souldiers should come thither, who would neither spare the Lives of the Guilty, nor the Estates and Fortunes of the rest.
This was terrible at first, to them of Wesell, who were commanded to readmit the Roman Rites, by the Counsel of the Duke of Cleves usurping the Princes Right, who by the German Laws, have free power and authority tO settle Re∣ligion. The United States had sent to the Senators, or Burgo∣masters, declaring, that it was an unworthy thing, at the beck of a barbarous Nation, which had abjured from their actions, all sense of piety, to change that Religion which was setled by Law, and by them received from their Ancestors, admo∣nishing the City, that in this Cause of God, they should not fear the power of man, but should couragiously resolve a∣gainst a storm that would continue but for a short space, and that they would not be unmindful of the common Religion, nor of any hospitable kindness; but their fear being at hand, and their hopes at a great distance, had so unsetled their minds, that they durst not stand the Contest: Whereupon, they prayed, that they might but enjoy the one half of the Churches, but that absolutely denyed, their Ministers eject∣ed, and both the Churches and Schools given to the Jesuites, a sort of men by that City generally hated; And for the more exact completion thereof, Coriblanus Garzados, the Popes Nuntio in Lower Germany, made solemn Processions, sprinkling the Ground with Holy Water, and cleansing the very Pulpits, as guilty of impiety, afterwards, the Commons of the City, for fifty years space, accustomed to more plain and simple Rites, were enforced to behold long Ceremonies of the Mass, and all other things fitted for States, which part of them beheld with rage, others with laughter and con∣tempt: The Priests continued in the large recesses of their Temples, mutually hating and hated; for the People as vio∣lently required their own, as they detested that strange Re∣ligion, which enmity continued, all the time the Spanish Forces abode in those Quarters; but when once they were departed, and they also that acted by their Authority, the
City returned again to her old Liberty and Customs. At this time, all the Consultations of Germany, inclining to revenge, Mendosa, although he had hitherto pretended, that it would be for the Kings profit, if they should begin a War which they could not maintain, and that he being igno∣rant of their Right, as Romanes had rather deal with them, according to Laws of War, though in truth, he was consci∣ous, that all in general were his Enemies; yet having by Spyes, tryed the affections and Authority of the most emi∣nent Princes, as what Allyances they had, what the manner of their Leagues, he neither spared Gifts, nor any kind of Policy, to breed a distraction and division among them at their meeting: And at last, it appeared worth his labour, to inquire, who supported that so deplorable, with Counsel and Advice: I know, some will admire, what they could at that time, offer as a pretence in their own justification: Wherefore, I will in as shot a method as I can, relate those things which Cardinal Andrews Envoy, spoke at the As∣sembly of the Inhabitants about the Rhine, within the Juris∣diction of Colen. These, after they had wasted much time, in the inquiring contrary to the Custom of Embassadors, of the Names and Instructions of those to whom they came, at last, as it were inforced to make a sudden defence, they said; They were much grieved, that the enemies of the true Religion, and the favourers of Rebels, had so filled the Princes ears, and the publick Assemblies, with false and scandalous Reports, as if it was unjust in the common cause of Christendom, which the King of Spain defended, to remit a few discommodi∣ties against particular persons: For these Arms were not taken up for the Kings pleasure or ambition, but for the repressing of Thieves and Robbers, who slighting all power, both of God and Man, create and believe a right from their succesful villany. Where were then those Assemblies, and raisings of Souldiers in Germany, and terrible decree, when
the Prince of Aurange actually engaged in a trayterous War, but one, but by example, undermined all the Princes of the Empire. All Powers were Armed by God, that they might suppress growing evills, and have often been punished justly for the neglect of their duty therein, but they did not onely dissemble others injuries, but their own, when the Germane Fields were wasted, and their Castles and Cities held by Rebels, without any account demanded for the same. That they needed no detractors, so bitterly to incite them, if the Germanes, mindful of their duty, (by whose advice the Spa∣niard would have been advised) had compelled those perpetual Enemies of peace at once to have laid down Arms, which are never used without the damage of the Neighbours. For what hath not been given by the Kings, either the Father or the Son, for the peace of Christendom, who for the avoiding of envy, having given the Netherlands from himself, and all the next Summer, a great Army at his Command, yet had worn it out in the onely hopes of Peace, until he oppressed his own Souldiers, as well with want, as with Winter; fo his Treasury was most honestly employed in the freeing of France from War and Garrisons: Then also, how great care he used in the setling a strict Discipline, whoever comes to succeed Mendosa in that charge, will quickly be sensible how great a care, and how difficult a work it was: There was no right of Victory claimed in any of the places by them taken; they onely desired entertain∣ment therein, and the Custody thereof, for a short time, with select and choyce Garrisons, that the Countries round about might be guarded from the excursions of the Hollanders: As to those faults objected against the Souldiers, which escaped either the providence, or punishment of the General, not∣withstanding the great noyse, yet in themselves were but small, if compared with the benefits heretofore done by the Emperour Charles, and King Philip: Let them also call to mind the Leagues; for how should the Princes, Bishops
Cities say, that it was free for them to follow neither party in this War, who had been antient Allies and Companions of the Burgundians, and whom Charles had obliged to him∣self, for a general assistance, in defence, and support of the Romane Religion? How often, by that name, have the Kings Deputies interposed denuntiations? how often have the People of Cleves been commanded, that they should not give passage to the Enemy, contrary to the Articles made at Venlo? and yet by their Cities, Arms and Traffick, the Enemies effrontery hath been increased, when at the same time, the Duke of Parma must restore Buricke, throw down the Fort against Rees, and suffer them to be quiet in the midst of War, so that the Isle of Gravewaert might be taken from the Hollander. And yet that was not performed, which cost the King the loss of his possession beyond the Rhine, so that he was fain afterwards to take a longer Journey, to re∣quire his own, and if it were with the damage of those by whose fault is happened, it was no great matter: And cer∣tainly, the Bishop of Colen would be much to blame, if he be too much moved at the complaints of the People of Munster, or any others; but rather He, and every Bishop else, that yet enjoy their Ecclesiastical Dignities, should give thanks to Philip, who (when Truxius made an impious War against the Germane Decrees, not one Germane resisting him, from whence some took occasion to assault the Priesthood) neg∣lected all his Affairs at the Bishops Request, and restored first Nuys, then Bnne, onely desiring that his might be re∣imbursed to him. The like he did by Bercke also, being ta∣ken from the Rebels, and while Albertus was busied ele∣where, lost again; yet lately, while there was any hopes of restoring the City to its right Lord, without force, he gave them a long time to treat thereof, in point of honour. If they would rightly consider these things, they would be bet∣ter advised, than by an improvident commiseration of small inconveniences to stir up greater mischiefs, of which per∣haps,
they would too late repent. And if the peace should be disturbed, they who infringed the same, ought to make satisfaction with their heads; but the King, the Arch-dukes, and Mendosa ought to be blameless. The like defence was made by those that were sent to the Emperour, and particular Princes to molifie them, with pro∣mise also, that the Souldiers should depart before April. The Ʋnited States, having so often in vain made tryal of Embas∣sies, had hitherto abstained from any in this case, as suppo∣sing, that it was permitted to the Spaniard, that he might with freedom do what he list, and harrass Germany at his pleasure; yet they make some defences for themselves, be∣ing angry that they, who came to rip up matters, should compare them in the ballance with Enemies: calling to mind all the places they had restored, and such as the Spa∣niard retained, that the offences of the borders were sought by those, by them tolerated, repeating all from the beginning of the Commotions in Cleves, to Truxius his War. That their Justice was testified by many who admired it, when not long since, they quitted Embden, and of later time Em∣meric: That it many times happened, that one place or other lying fit for the Enemy, was to be first taken, which they esteemed no oppression, for that it is absolutely necessary for the preservation of Subjects, against the Spanish Insolencies, not otherwise to be avoided, which also was done by a mo∣dest Souldier, whose pay was certain, and Discipline strict. It might be probable, some faults of a few ou-runners, might be committed, and yet escape both knowledge and punish∣ment: But they never lead an Army into the Territories of others, by publick Conduct and Authority, they never made Seditions on purpose to rob the Country, nor did they ever inforce a Form of Religion upon People, with whom they had nothing to do; That they promised to take care of Gravewaert, lest the Geldrians should refuse any arbiters. That there were many other things, which either made their
cause plausible, or detect the Spaniard of covetousness under the false name of pretended piety; but having been spoken of before, needed not to be here repeated; In brief, That they would no longer suffer such a slavish sort of men, to in∣sult over free Nations. While these things were arguing pro and con, before the Deputies of the five Countries, at the meeting of the Rhine and Moselle, the Counsels relating to War, went but slowly on; nor were some wanting, that esteemed it convenient at that time, to joyn their Forces with the Hollanders, being men well experienced in Military Affairs. But the greater part thinking it sufficient to receive back their own, refusing to engage Germany into a long War, many of whom so dreading either the hatred or displeasure of the Emperour, and the great mens power, that when there was any debate con∣cerning the fore-mentioned injuries received, they solici∣tously avoyded to mention the name of the Spanish King, or People: But the States laboured most earnestly, to gain to themselves Associates, from whose dissentions, as they reap∣ed disadvantage, so from their good successes, they might gain the power of making peace at pleasure. The principal Authours for bringing this Expedition to maturity, were, the Count Palatine, one of the severe Electors, the Landgrave of Hessen, and the Duke of Brunswicke, who undertaking the Affairs in their own Names, and with their own Forces, which they had raised to a great number the last Winner; but a contention arising between Hessen and Brunswicke, con∣cerning the chief Command in the War, hindered it, the Palatine also desirous of rest and peace, received for himself the defence of the inner parts, and the charge of all publick Assemblies. The Westfalian Romanists, making use of this division, no∣thing being more hateful to them, then to see the Protestant Princes in Arms, by offering a three months Tribute, equal to that given to the Turk, that their Governour might be made
General of the War, they obtained their aym, averting it to be just and consonant to the Germane Customs, that when∣soever any injury is suffered, in whatever Country a War is to be maintained for obtaining satisfaction, the Command was always given to them for their ayd. The States passed this Winter in great care and fear, in regard the Rivers were twice shut up with Frost, but yet, without loss or damage; for Prince Maurice, and Count William, dividing their Forces, He took care of all on this side Issell from Arnheym, and this resided at Meppell, for the Guard of the further parts, continual Messengers with In∣telligence passing between them; At this time, several plots were detected against Breda, Nimmeghen, and Devinter, Which did but increase the care and cost in the defence thereof; Now also were the Mauribian Souldiers more then once Conquerours over their Enemies, and by the slaughter and plunder of a certain Garrison, recompenced the honour of those Soldiers that were hang'd in the Territory of Juliers, or Gulicke; though it is confessed, to be the worst Custom of all Martial Discipline, that for neglect of the publick execution of the Law, permits Captains to take their own private revenge. The Town of Emmeric, which we mentioned to be freed by Prince Maurice, was now again surprized by the Spani∣ards, who under pretence of their marching away in Fe∣bruary, had brought thither Cannon, to the great terrour of the Magistrates, though both the Souldiery and the Citizens were couragious enough, and the passage besides so difficult, by the increase of the Waters, that they were forced to come in with Boats. In the same place, soon after, the falling of the Jesuites House by the decay of a Pillar, was by many looked upon as prodigiously ominous to them: And Count Bucquoy, the Governour of the Garrison there, was taken prisoner, while he followed a small party cunningly sent out to get booty,
until he fell into the Ambush, which Lewes of Nassau had prepared for him; And the truth is, about this time, the Kings Affairs suffered many and frequent damages, but none of any great concernment; for at the approach of the Spring, the Horse being Quartered in divers places; Paulus Emilius Martinengo became a Prisoner; Frederick Count Herem∣berge also narrowly escaping the danger, all his Friends and Companions being taken: likewise the Guard of the Port at Antwerp was forced, and great spoyl carryed away: and at Sea a Ship carrying Arms from Hamburgh into Spain, was taken. As yet they had no money, but at last, three hundred thousand Ducats, was taken up with the Merchants at exces∣sive Usury, meerly to stop their mouths for the present. By which means, Antwerp and Liereo, by the change of their Garrisons, were quitted of fear; from whence the said Souldiers departing fearfully, they that remained were af∣terwards thrust out of the Borders by Edict, and every where fell into the hands of the Germans, where they suffered as victimes to the publick hatred; for all the faults had been committed by others. At Gaunt, the Souldiers having be∣haved themselves with more moderation, stayed; but a mu∣tiny began in Bercke for the same cause, which continued all the year: These things, together with their want of money, and scarcity of all things else, made the supplies which had been raised in Italy and Germany, to delay their march to∣wards them, and besides daily some or other ran over to the Hollanders, who had newly advanced their pay. Cardinal Andrew and Mendosa, that they might the bet∣ter remedy these evils, and also mollifie the Germanes, with a kind of a promise, in the beginning of April, the Spring being dry, and more early than is usual for that Clymate, so that Cattel were put out into the Pastures, they command their Army out of their Winter Quarters, to descend on both sides the Rhine: which Army, consisted of fifteen
thousand men. But the Garrisons of Emeric and Rees, by reason of the Commodity of the place, were left there; as also in Gennep by the Maes, the rest of the Cities were com∣pelled to give the Souldiers a testimonial of their just and modest behaviour, during the last Winter. Mendosa in the mean while, not neglecting as a Gratuity for so long Entertainment, to deduct a part of the Souldiers pay. A whole moneth was almost spent in the march; but at last, the Army sate down on both sides the River against Gravewaert; And this had been advised by Mendosa, not without hopes of winning it, which, if it had happened, had been of great advantage to them. But Richardot was of Opi∣nion, that it could not be done, because the Duke of Parma had formerly attempted it in vain; The Cardinal Andrew, preferred an Assault upon the Isle of Bommell. And the chief labour was, to obscure and keep from the Enemy this their design: But Prince Maurice was so much perplexed, as he could neither rest by day, nor sleep by night, being distracted with innumerable cares, because he wanted his well-known Companions in Arms, and was destitute of a sufficient Army; for the chief of all his Captains, Count William was forced to stay in Frizeland, to have an Eye to the Affairs of Embden. Vere was detained in England, others were in Germany, the raysers of the War were scattered here and there, and they who were to serve therein, were absent; besides, the foreign Regiments were not arrived, which the States had commanded to be listed in several parts, that they might be the better able to defend themselves against the greatest strength the Enemy should bring upon him. He had onely with him, Four Thousand men, wherewith he was to defend the passage of Issell, the right and left side of the Rhine, and the superiour and inferiour parts of the Country.
Therefore having received the Castle of Lovec, and other places, which he had late before rendred to the people of Cleves, he once again pitched his station in the Island of Geldre, where he found all the fortifications he had erected there the last year, standing intire, and not at all defaced or demolished by the Enemy. Part of the forces held the Isle of Holland it self; with these orders, that what City or Fort soever Mendosa should assail, he would defend the con∣trary side, and by Arms and Valor strengthen the weakness of the Bulwarks, and for the more easy, accomplishing his purpose, upon the banks he placed Watch-Towers, and on the Rivers Bridges, that his Scouts and aids might with the less difficulty come at one another. When this was done, he made a defence about Gravewaert, which he had before strengthened with a garrison, that was too slender against the darts and shot of the Enemy on every side; and into the River he put two rows of stakes, for the stopping of those Vessels, that by the command of Mendosa were said to be preparing at Colen: His Cannon, shot were aimed with that skill from a little rising, whose scite they had tryed, that ma∣ny of the Enemy being cut off therewith, they were forced to remove part of their Can to another place. In this in∣terim, the horse from Nimmighen tyred them with frequent excursions, nor did there want the opportunity of obtaining a noble Victory upon the one part of their divided Army, but his number was too small to ut it in execution, as the Prince did afterwards confess, not without a deep sense of grief. At this time the Prince received intelligence, both from his Scouts, and some Prisoners, but he feared, least if he should go away, the enemy would make his entrance other∣where, for he had indeavoured by various and false reports to make all things dubious, using to advantage their fires in stead of a direction. Among all these ambiguities, nothing seemed more safe, then to stand still, and to have all things
in readiness for a march, to load the Waggons, and keep the horses harnessed together both night and day. The Spaniards did not without cause hope for many and great oppor∣tunities from the Isle of Bommel, as from the inclosure there∣of by the chief rivers, and that it hath not one passage into the bowels of the Enemyes Country; That the Rhine which is now called Waell, mingling it self also with the Maes, so ran into the Sea, is every where declared in Romans writers. But it cannot be said, how great mutations have happened in later times by frequent inundations, when as yet there had not been suh care taken for banks as at present, and when the Maes run formerly another way, as is set th in the an∣tiquities of our fathers, the name of the old chnel beyond Hesdin sufficiently testifies: but now it runs thus, That part of Gelderland which runs forth by Cleves between both the Rivers, is by the Inhabitants properly called Maesland, and by little and little growing narrower, ends at the conflux of the Rivers, which by their doubly mixed waters in a short space, make the Island of Voorn, from whence again dividing and growing distinct Rivers, each follows his own course, keeping their names till they meet again, making a fair Island, belonging to the Jurisdiction of Gildres, whose chief place is the Village Harwarden, and its utmost bounds, the Castle of Lovesteine, which is the name of a Town hard by the Isle of Bommel, encompassed almost round about with the Waell. This City in the Duke of Alva's time, was one of the first that threw off serviude, and from that instant hath held a firm Alliance with the Hollanders, each to be a mutual defence to the other. Not far from Harwarden are the bendings of the River, and then the Isle is discovered a∣again at the Village of Rossem famous for the birth of Mar∣tin of Rossem, who at the command of the Emperor Charles first came into the Netherlands with a band of spoylers, and afterwards changing his quarters, entred France, from hence
these Rivers run separate and divided a great space, but the Maes took a greater circuit, more largely spotting it self in the fields of Brabant, tending Southerly, where in a strait course it looks upon Boisledac, and so passeth in the middle between the fort of Creveceur, and the Castle Hely within the Island, afterwards falls into Holland, and in a small divi∣sion of it self surrounding the Isle Hemert, and washing the walls of Hoesden, finisheth his course in an entire body. The Spaniards hopes and resolutions concerning the in∣sion of these places, was heightned by several guids sent to the tops of the Alps, who upon their return, with one con∣sent did declare, That the snows there being less than usual, did promise small increase of the waters and Rivers. And it was thought fit, not to go in a great body, but in several parties, that by the shew of keeping their Camp at Grave∣waert, they might as long as possible make the Enemy linger and delay to give timely assistance. Therefore they that had hitherto staid at Gennep, now removed to Sapen, as if they intended it only for securing their provisions; soon af∣ter were added Barlot and Stanley with their Regiments of Spaniards, Walloons, and Irish, four hundred horse under the conduct of Henry Count Heremberg first descending, sudden∣ly to assault Voorne Island, if it were slackly guarded. But perceiving it to be in vain, they stayed hard by, untill the boats that were to be brought in Carts from Boisleduc arrived to their help, yet with their great Guns, for they had brought some thither, they shot at a Ship of the Hollanders, which lay there to guard the River, and passing the Maes not far from Rossem, drove the Enemyes horse from off the banks, while the Foot durst nor venture to resist, and so entred the Isle of Bommel, wandring sometimes here, sometimes there, waiting either for orders, or more additional forces, and the commanders themselves being equal in power, fall at vari∣ance among themselves, loosing thereby that fair opportu∣nity,
the Cardinal Andrew fearing reproof and expostulati∣ous more then was requisite in Martial Discipline: And as at other times, so here the goodness of God was manifest to∣wards the Hollanders, when for the most part all humane counsells were deficient for the managing of these great and apparent hopes against them: For the City of Bommel, a place of great esteem in the war, lay almost open to any as∣sailant the old Fortifications thereof being narrow and weak, and the new begun three years before not perfect, while the State, being drawn to mind other affairs, spared to lay out any moneyes about this place, and the rather, because the water on the one side, and the arshy wetness of the earth on the other, seemed to be a defence to it against the Enemy. The Prince hearing of these things, hasted speedily to march thither, yet did not arrive till the second day after the Ene∣mies passage; yet before they had attained the bank of the Waell, he came into the City and restored courage to the Ci∣tizens that were surprised with fear of the danger, and pre∣paring to fly. For although he confirmed as well the Isle of Hemart, as any other places he doubted, both by his care and Souldiers, yet he was most intent for Bommell, where he him∣self was for the most part present, to increase their garrison; and to help forward their works. And at this time there was manifested excellent wayes of dfending Towns, made use of frequently by the Prince afterwards, and no less used by the Spaniards, and the use thereof is likely to continue to perpetuity, as oft as any are in fer to be besieged, by mee∣ting the Enemy with far extended fortifications, which yield a great space to the Defendants, and keep off danger a lon∣ger time from the inner parts of a place; for to the Forts which were joyned to the Breast-work, more and more great Rampires were added, which being themselves invi∣roned with water, did contain whatever was necessary for defence in their outermost line, having many strong defences.
While these things were speeding forward, the Spanish for∣ces, and they who marched away from Emmeric, with other their associates, who then by chance had begun to besiege Creveceur Fort, met all together, to whom the Fort was easi∣ly rendred, as also what was opposite to the Fort in Hely Ca∣stle; There Mendosa made a bridg of boats over the Maes, for the transporting of his Souldiers and provisions, where∣with he was abundantly supplyed from Boisleduc. That Ci∣ty rejoycing that the Enemy was driven from being their neighbours, and being very, diligent and careful in the rest, that they might with the less offence refuse a garrison, they would admit Cardinal Andrew but with a certain number of men to come within their walls. These strong attempts of the Enemy did not terrify the Hollanders, but made them rather be more intent then before, with courage to employ both their Wealth and Forces, for they were about for the increasing their treasury, to set a tax or impost upon all sales, contentions and Inheritances, which was taken very hardly; but the two hundredth penny was more burthensome, and therefore continued but a short while, although the custome thereof was of old much commended among free people for the equality thereof. But the Riches of many were unknown, or else by reason of traffiquing uncertain, and the suspected Faith of Professors hindred the same: And this highly of∣fended the common people, that the most wealthy men, if they gave two thousand Florens for their two hundreth part, they were eased for any further burthen by reason of their Trade or Profession, which was given, partly for the avoi∣ding of envy, and partly for the ease of the Nobility, as the pooer sort did not stick to cry out; as if the equality of the tax had been laid aside in favour of some few. Besides the Fleet sent into Spain, whereof we shall speak in its proper place, then first of all began new Germane levyes, and Switzer Footmen to be first used. Then also were Laws of
Arms written; And Lanoue raised a Regiment of two thousand French that could not endure to live in peace; for which cause, when the Spaniards complained of violation of the League, King Henry answered, That nothing was done by his command, yet he would not hinder the carrying out of France to either party such as were willing to go to war, that thereby the old names of factions might the sooner wear out. And the States forces so pleased them, that part of their men, animated by youthfull vigor, and others weary of tedious expences, desi∣red a Battle. But Prince Maurice shewed them, That the Enemy might more safely be eluded otherwise, and the matter comming to be disputed by a fight, would do no great damage to the Spanish Souldiers, but among the people, the least wounds were great causes of terror. Count William being present, ap∣plauded this prudence, being always averse to rash and hot-headed Counsels. Afterwards therefore, Mendosa himself came to Bommel with all his strength, and then it was furi∣ously contested both by strength of Works, and shot of the Cannon, yet with no great damage as to the main, only some loose straglers were sometimes killed. But above two thou∣sand men were in a short time lost in the Spanish Camp; among which were two brothers, a long time absent from each other, and so unknown to one another, especially the one of them going by his Mothers name, these meeting ac∣cidentally, and by discourse knowing each other, while they were embracing, both their heads were struck off with a great shot, by which means they obtained this good, That after that joy, they should never have more cause of grief. The like chance happened in Prince Maurice's Camp to a Man and his Wife, lying together, their sleep being by a like shot, turned into a sudden death. There fell out sometimes light skirmishes between the Horse as they met abroad in parties, but all more like the contests between two adverse Camps, then the bickerings
at a Siege. At last Mendosa returning back to Rossem, Prince Maurice also, having sufficiently strengthened the Town, both above and below, which he had made two Brid∣ges for passing the Waell, he quartered his Souldiers in the Isle of Voorne, (which he had fortified with new Works ac∣cording to the manner of that excellent platform) and all about the outer bank of the Waell. The Spaniards with continual shooting (as much as ever is used against Walls) endeavoured to force his passage in the County of Tilen, which is from thence beyond the Waell, but by the strong opposition of Count Ernest, to whom that Region belonged, and a small Island in the Waell near Ros∣sm, he was hindred. Nor was that Prince satisfied in ha∣ving defended his own, but he proceeded further, and vo∣luntarily undertook to oppose and assail all that pretended to be of their party; and first of all beyond the Maes, in the next part of Brabant which looks back upon Voorne, he com∣manded his men to make light and sudden incursions, on purpose thereby to weary out the Enemyes Horse that lay thereabouts to guard and oversee the Pastures and Provisions. And shortly after being encouraged by success to attempt greater things, ealy in the morning he commanded some well experienced in such matters, with three hundred Soul∣diers, to go into the Isle of Bommel, in that part, where we said Harwarte stands, and there to set up Pallisadoes or Stakes, in form of an Half-Moon, and then hastning it for∣ward as fast as they could, to cover them with Earth. This space of ground would have contained about six thousand men. And at once, both the Work, and Forces, unwitting at first to the Enemy, encreased; from whence arose so great a confidence, that the Prince himself publickly came thither to view it.
This daring Attempt was much further'd by the long Consultations of Mendosa, while his Advisers differ'd in Opinion: For now the Work was raised twice the heighth of a Man, when the Enemy drawing on, some chosen Spanish and Italian Souldiers led by Sapena, to the Number of Two Thousand, incensed with Fury and Religion, gave a sharp Assault; but the Monks that carryed before them Crucifixes, were slain or taken among the first. Some there were, whose Ardor of Spirit was such, that having carryed them beyond the Trench, they were forced to come to Hand-strokes: Nor did the Defendants want equal Valour, besides the goodness of their Counsel and Conduct, which keeping them in an intire state, made both their Blows and Shot certain. La∣nove commanded the French, Horatio Vere the English, and one Edmunds the Scots; each of them encouraging their Men both by Words and Example: But Prince Maurice's Ar∣tillery, from the Isle of Voorne, and the Bank of the Waell, Levoll'd against Them on every side, chiefly tyred out the Enemy, who at length was glad to go away, carrying with them many of their dead Bodies. Some Reported, That in this Action there were Seven Hundred Men slain; surely, then the Match was very une∣qual, when not many above Ten were slain on the Defen∣dants side. Among the slain Captains was found Paciotto, who having been lately taken Prisoner, was not to be dant∣ed in this fair Assay, for Reparation of his last Honour. After this, the Fot went on, together with some smaller beyond the Maes; although the forcible Attempt upon that the Enemy had made at Lutten proved in vain: Without doubt, these Camps were an excellent Pattern for the future Times, where an Army was divided by so many Islands and Banks; yet by Ships possessing the River, and the Artificiall Workmanship of five Bridges, moveable whither soever they listed, they could by alternate Courses come one to ano∣ther
as they pleased: Nor durst Mendosa offer any Assault to Prince Maurice's Works; but a Fugitive shewing a place he had taken above Rossem, where (as is formerly related) the bending of the Rivers meet nearest; there following the Counsel, that formerly Charles Mansfeldt had taken, and then revived by Collonel Charles Colonna, (the same who hath with very great Judgment ahd Fidelity deliver'd these Things to Posterity) himself, with no small part of his men, Erected a strong Fort from the Ground, which, from the Cardinal Andrew, was named Fort-Andrew, lying on this hand upon the Waell, on that upon the Maes, stopped up all Passage, as well by Water as by Land. Thus was the Sum∣mer spent, and leaving here a Garrison, this was the onely Issue remaining of all their Labour: The rest of the Soul∣diers being dispersed in Brabant, returned to their old Licen∣tiousness. After this Barlotte had very near taken Worcum, a Town of Holland, by a Night Stratagem; and while he protracted time, in advising upon the very place of Action, a Citizen being advertized thereof by a Sentinel, had scarce time enough to get the Port before him. While these Things were transacting with all earnestness among the Hollanders, the Germans and Spaniards used on the one side Sloth, on the other ridiculous Folly; for the Spaniards were not secured by their own Valour or Vertue, which was of no esteem with their other Enemies, but the Germans Discords among themselves, which made them so confident, as to despise a Nation long unconquer'd, and fear∣ed on every side openly. For the Emperour, Bishops, and others of the Romane Religion, were against the War. These Princes by themselves, to wit, the Duke of Brunswic the Landgrave of Hessen, and Marquess of Brandenburg, (for the Count Pa∣latine had withdrwn himself from the Quarrel, pretending the Examples of the Bishops of Mentz and Triers) long
esteem'd all kind of Military Men unprofitable to the Com∣mon-wealth, until in the middle of Summer, they met about Berck, to the number of 2000 Horse, and 12000 Foot; the chief Command whereof was intrusted in Simon Count of Luppen, at the desire of the Westfalians, as is before rela∣ted; but having obtain'd their desire, they never sent the Aid they so strongly promised, but rather on the contrary, the Spaniards receiv'd from the very City of Colen both Souldi∣ers and other Instruments of War: The General, not dis∣sembling his small Experience in Matters of War, did give all his Authority over the inferiour Saxons to Count Ho∣henlo, and of those about the Rhine to Count Solms, who, un∣der pretence of the Confederate States, had associated Them∣selves by Oath: Neither did these Two want any Valour or Daring, but acted, as if They could not have been tired with Labour. But both were better Souldiers than Counsellors, and so distructed the Affair by continual Contests; the Soul∣dier also, ignorant of his Duty, gave himself over to Sloth and Drunkenness, and if their Pay was not ready for them as soon as it was due, they were apt to Mutiny, and fall into Se∣dition; yet they took a Fort of the Spaniards at Berck, and came forward in the Cause with great Slaughter and Cruel∣ty. At the same time they Garrison'd Viseo and Emmric; but when they came to Berck, they were neither prepar'd for the Assault or Siege thereof with any thing, saving a few Canon, and other Things sent to Them under-hand by the States, lest they should seem to own either Party, which the Emperour had strictly forbidden. Moreover, the Army was not supplyed with Provisions, because the Neighbors refused rather by force than willingly, the Spaniard sending to them continual Embassies, excusing thereby former Miscarriages, and, for the future, promising better Things; whereby they grew so confident, that when Berck was beleaguer'd round,
Mendosa, as in Contempt, refused either to augment the Garrison, or send the Souldiers (mutinying therein) their Pay. Wherefore the Germans thought fit rather to reduce Rees, that so they might have Supplies of Victuals from the Hollanders nearer hand, or any thing else that they stood in need of. Thi∣ther was come Herman Count Heremberge, by Command of Cardinal Andrew, he might lay the blame of his own men with the Hollanders, spun out much time, with the hope of restoring cert in places; and thereupon resolutely answer'd, That the States had rendred up many Towns, and more Forts, without any Conditions, and that they should not, by an unequal Comparison, seek to hide their Crimes: And being asked, If he had brought Money wherewith to satisfie so many People of the Damage done to them; and what Caution should be given, that the same Evils should not afterwards be re-acted, when the ta∣king so many Towns, and the wasting so many Fields, made ma∣nifest, that the King's Promise and Seal were but Feeble Pillars for them to trust to, or rely on. But Deeds differ'd from Words; and therefore the Commanders, by wasting Time in Disputes, and the Souldier growing effeminate more and more by Idleness, began to commit Rapines, and other wic∣ked Acts, doing nothing against the Enemy, but daring to act over again those Villanies, which They were come thi∣ther to punish and revenge. At the very Siege of Rees there was no Hostility; but, as in Derision, the Germans were invited to Drinking; and some there were that went, shook Hands with them, and re∣turned safe; until this private Collusion of the Souldiers, was at last changed into a Truce for certain Days. Without all doubt, the Confederate States expected many and great Things from this German Commotion, which produced them no other benefit, unless that while so great an Army grew stupid through Idleness, Count William being sent from Bommel with seven Troops of Horse, and fifty Companies of Foot to Doetichem, taken by Mendosa the Year before, and re-took it
from the Enemy within three days, although the Season were very wet, and the Besieged made strong Defence by shooting, and otherwise. About the same time Lewis of Nassau, being sent towards Grave with some Troops, though the Enemy over-matched him in Number, yet he pursued their Party, and by provident Conduct, through the narrow Passages of the Journey, and by the side of the Maes, brought back the Booty, which the Enemy had taken in the Country. And by this time the Truce was ended at Rees, yet was no progress made in the Siege; for the truth is, the Commanders were not skill'd in those Affairs. And the Pioneers of Holland that came thither, chose rather continuance of small Wages, and long Work with Safety, than great Wages, and short Work with Dan∣ger. There were scarce any shew of Guards or Sentinels throughout the Camp, so that their fresh Souldiers came into the Town with Relief: And now Winter drawing on when, according to the Custom of War, a Herald being sent too inconsiderately by the Besiegers with a Summons, the Besieged retaining the Messenger, suddainly sally'd out upon the un∣provided and unwary Enemy, of whom they slew near 200, and carryed off with them some of their Guns, which strook so great a Terrour into their weak and Cowardly Hearts, that they not onely raised the Siege, but deserted their Camp, in an unworthy and almost unparallel'd flight, leaving behind them both their Boats, and all sorts of Provisions; part of which, the Spaniards carryed away; other part, the Germans themselves, who were on the Spaniard's Party. Thus, in a short time, this Army mouldred to nothing, while some mutinyed for their Pay; and others averred, they were entertain'd onely for three Moneths Service. The Duke of Brunswick punish'd many of his People with Death, for their vitious Behaviour and Negligence: The Souldiers also in the Fort near Berck fled, and so did they that under Hohenlo had besieged Gennep, as soon as the Spaniards had but drawn on their Garrison
for the Relief of Rees: Scarcely were Orseo and Emmerie preserved by a mean Party of Souldiers, before this shame∣ful failing of Germany, it had often been in Agitation; that throwing aside all dissembling Vizors, they should publikely make a League with the States, and receive Aid from them; or that the Charge and Command of the War should be gi∣ven to Prince Maurice, who was very expert and knowing in Warlike Affairs. But it was not fit to send to the States, because their Care was taken up in the Defence of their own Borders: Besides, the Terrour of the Spanish Fleet, made them strengthen their Sea-Coasts; and the English, possessed with the same Fear, required their Men, in the States Pay, for their own Guard. Nor was the Prince, finding by Count William, who was sent before, to see how the German Affairs stood, over-hasty to thrust himself into Dangers, and to take Souldiers under him, that would neither learn Obedience, nor any other good Arts. As long as the Enemy continued in the Field about Bom∣mel, the Prince durst not draw his Souldiers into Winter-quar∣ters, although the States were almost tyred out with the vast∣ness of the Charge, notwithstanding the help they had by the Money which the King of France sent to them under-hand: But when Mendosa, Autumn now wasting apace, compell'd thereto by nothing more than the Hunger and Diseases of his men, sending his Souldiers into several Quarters, the better to keep them from Sedition and Mutinies, himself went to the Borders of Germany; Then did he also dissolve his Camp, first placing Forts and Guards along the River, to keep in and repress any Excursions from Fort Andrew. He fortified Emmerio also against Mendosa, and freed the Citi∣zens fro the fear of a hated Garrison, by sending Souldiers thither in the Night. These Things being all acted by Land, I have continued in an uninterrupted Order and Series, now Time calls us to take a view of Naval Affairs.
We have elsewhere related, that while Philip the Second Reigned, he permitted the Hollanders to Trade freely into Spain, even in the heat of the War, but under the names of other People, yet so, as that it was apparent, to be a piece of great prudence, to be willing to be deceived, whether the hopes of their returning to their obedience, made him trans∣fer that benefit to other Nations, or that he had found by the event. It was not safe to cavil with People prevalent at Sea, lest they should keep all that Commerce from Spain, Which they would maintain free to all the rest of the World; But as for the most part, those Counsels are irksome to a Successor, wherein before he was unconcerned, so here, the Son of Philip disliked his Fathers notions, and as if despair∣ing of peace, turned all things to a pitch of severity. It was evident enough to the whole World, that all the Hollanders Wealth, was drawn out of the Sea, and raised by Merchan∣dise, and that the greatest profit by them gotten, was from the Spanish Trade, because they carried thither, not onely their own Wares and Commodities; but also Sarmatian fruits, and other things, and bringing from thence Gold and Silver, whereof as there is plenty with them, being Lords of the Indies: so there is great use among Merchants, and dealers in Trading and Traffick; and therefore the Nerves and Si∣news of the War, being taken away, it was hoped, that the War it self would cease of its own accord: To this purpose, all Holland Stamen found in Spain, were taken up and ap∣prehended, part of them being put to great torments, and punishments, and others either thrown into prison, or con∣demned to the Galles. In the Netherlands also, an Edict was set out in the Name of the New Princess Isabella, stuffed with many railing Speeches against the Governours of Holland, who, as ever before, so now, changing their Government, and being sepa∣rated from Spain, refused peace, when offered to them, and stirred up others to War, their so great pride and arrogance
proceeding from no other Fountain, then that Trade and Merchandising, which her Fathers too much indulgence, had hitherto allowed them. Many of the Brabanders, and Flandrians, withstood this Decree, and would not have the Netherlandish Exportations, Importations, or Transportations, taken away, because of the great want they had of the Holland Commodities: But wrath and spleen prevailed, and hopes of supplying their necessi∣ties out of France, so that by the said Decree, all security was taken away, even from Fishermen, whom they had till that time, spared in the heat of War: This matter did not a little trouble the States, because hereby, two of the Peoples chief Supports were taken away, from whence it was feared that the Seamen would have mutined, and the Merchants have left them to have found out places of a better, and more free Trade. Yet they did not degenerate from their Pristine Counsels; They had learned from Society and Al∣lyance of the English, that there was nothing in all the Span∣ish Dominions, less to be feared than Spain it self; all its Kings putting their chief confidence in this, that no peace should be left to any other Nations within themselves; and they conceived it necessary for themselves, to have some War at Sea, for the keeping at home their Marriners, and that it would be very glorious, if they should bring upon Spain, denying Traffick, that penury wherewith the Spaniard threatned them. Therefore by a contrary Decree, repeating all the facinorous acts which formerly the Spaniards com∣mitted in the Netherlands, and now of late in Germany, and all other things that might make them be envyed and hated, they forbid all their People to carry into Spain any Provisi∣ons or Merchandise; and if any should be found doing to the contrary, they should be looked on as Enemies, and Factors, and Abettors of their Enemies: the Fishermen also were prohibited, to purchase impunity, or License, from the Enemy, adding, that they would take care to keep the Sea
free for them; and if any one suffered any damage, it should be lawful to them, to take satisfaction by the wast and spoil of the Enemies Country. A Copy of this Decree, was sent to several Kings and People, that none might pre∣tend ignorance thereof. Of which, the King of France took particular Cognizance, protesting, That if any of his Sub∣jects should within six moneths sail into Spain, the State should incur no danger by their wilful breach, but it should wholly light upon themselves, but all the rest passed it over in silence. This done, they prepared a Fleet, raking together, what∣ever publick money could be raised by Tributes, or other∣wise, undertaking a great hazardous Affair, and scarce ever accomplished with any indifferent success, as is manifest by divers Examples of Antiquity; for when Hanniball was drawn out of Italy, Scipio became Conquerour of Carthage, and Agathocles having wasted Africa a long time, yet at last, the Athenian Wealth was overthrown by the Scicilians Arms, And there was a fresh Example of the like nature, eleven years before this time, in the great Fleet of King Philip, when it was plainly, as it were, set out by fate, that the Hol∣landers and Spaniards should by turns find, how uncertain the hopes of those things were, which are committed to the Winds and Waves. At the beginning of Summer, they set out a Fleet of threescore and thirteen Ships, carrying eight thousand Seamen and Souldiers, under the Command of Peter Douse the Admirall, who was a Noble man; but as if he had had no Honour from his Birth, attained to this heighth of Command, by long Service, and many gradations: they received Command to destroy the Fleet, which the King of Spain had been a great while in building, for want of Tim∣ber, Cordage, and Marriners; and this was one cause that induced the States to make so much hast, that done, to spoyl the American Ships, and wast all the Coasts of the said Ene∣mies Dominion. This unusual and daring attempt, carryed with it, great
terrour, so that the Shores were left desolate, all flying from thence; for there were Letters sent before out of Holland, that mentioned the coming of the Fleet into these parts, as if it had been learned from some Captives. The Fleet begun by King Philip, lay at Corunna: At first, the Hollanders came and lay by them, but they not daring to trust the naked Fleet to their Enemies mercy, got under the protection of a strong Castle; and then the Cannon thun∣dering from the Ships, Castle, and Fort, which was hard by, took away all their hopes of assaulting, either at distance, or near at hand: Wherefore, having seen enough here, that that Nation which boasted it self Lady of the Ocean, had with their Fleet, sought a hole, and hid themselves in their Docks, rather then to fight at Sea with Honour. When they came to the mouth of the River Tagus, some were greedy and violent, for the taking of Lisbone, either for Honours sake, or in hope of a prey, urging, the antient discords of their Neighbour-hood, the hated Dominion of the Castilians. And lastly, the City it self, which in the Expedition of the English for Don Antonio, was found to be but weak, though it were very large; and if that Nation took it then, that went to manage a War, not to seek for Booty, without doubt, it will be as easily done now. On the other side many were of Opinion, that in so long a Peace, the King had repaired and made good all defects, and that it was not to be expected, that a Fleet so long looked for should do any good against such great Cities, wherein, as well the care, as the fear of the Governours, makes them diligent. It would be a safer course, to steer to the Islands in the Atlantike Ocean, bordering upon the Coast of Barbary, which the An∣tients, either for the Fecundity of the Soyl, or because they so called and esteemed all unknown things, named the For∣tunate Islands; from whence the People came, that first in∣habited them, by reason of their far distance and Antiquity, is very uncertain.
Of old, when they were yet unknown to Europe, they had several sorts of Language: That of Tenariffe came near to African, and the People thereof, called themselves Guanchus. Many of their Customs were common to them with the Barbarians, particularly, like the Scithians, they used to expose, and give their Wives to prostitution; with the Indians, they esteem their Sisters Sons, as their Heirs, as being related to them by the surer tye of consanguinity. Rapes violently committed, they punish with death, they account Divorces infamous. It is lawful onely for their Kings to marry their Sisters, as among the Inchas of Peru: Private men may, if they will, have more Wives than one; This also is a Scythian Custom, that the King, or chief Lord, should have the Virginity of every new marryed Bride; The Gods they worship, are the Sun, Moon, and Stars, above whom there is one Judge, they say, of good and evill acti∣ons; and therefore, that there is another life after death: Infants are with solemn Rites, purified with water. They give no publick demonstrations of Christianity, or Maho∣metisme, yet they live simply, unanimously, and innocently, far beyond them that are called Christians, and practise no∣thing but force, fraud, and other Vices, not of Religion, but the Age; The first that came thither, were the Genoueses, in the Year, One Thousand Three Hundred: Almost a hun∣dred years after that, Bethineurt, a Noble-man of Picardy, came and Inhabited there, teaching them good manners and Piety, affirming himself also to be a King: But when his Fortune would not answer to so high a Title, the right of the same was transferred to the Kings of Castile, whose Potency destroyed their antient Rites, Language and Orders, and made these Islands one step to his further greatness. One of these, named Ganaria (though now it is a common name to them all) but to this, the head of the rest, it belongs peculiarly: the Castle wherein, being excellently seated, the Hollanders Fleet subdued, and one Spanish Ship, in the
sharp fight sunk, and two others taken. The Horse and Foot of the Island gathering together upon the shore, with some small Guns, hoped to hinder their landing, for that the place it self was not very fit for that purpose. But the Admiral Duse, commanded his Cannon to be shot off, and his long Boats to be hastned, Himself first going off, when the Shelves would not suffer him to come close to the shore, he leaped into the water, but the Enemy run to meet him, him∣self received three wounds, and others of his Company many, by the casting of Darts and Shot, being unexperien∣ced, both in that old and new sort of Arms. But the Barba∣rians being beaten, into the Town of Allagene, the Castle was presently surrendred, with the Guns and Garrison: they that entred, wondered as they set their Mauritian Ensigns up in a place so far distant, to see the excellent, Fortifications of the place, and all other things necessary for defence, un∣less that in all that Age, the seldom happening of mischan∣ces had now in this suffering, so converted all into fear, that they had no use of their Arms. The Army being led to the Town, some dayes were spent by the Besiegers, in drawing thither their Cannon. In which time, the Besieged did convey whatsoever was dear and pre∣cious to them among the Rocks, which were in a manner, un∣passable; and shortly after, themselves followed, either into the same, or other narrow places, that were easie to be defended, many of them being so ignorant, who the Enemy was, that a runaway Negro offered to sell himself to the Hollanders, and abjure Christian Religion. Besides this, two other smaller Castles were deserted: Some that were sent out to find their lurking holes, and to strike a terrour into them, going further than was convenient, in places known to the Enemies, but to them altogether unknown; and be∣sides, being wearied with labour and heat, were surrounded by the Barbarians, and slain. Wherewith the Islanders be∣ing overjoyed, refused to redeem themselves, or their goods;
but making an excuse of poverty; whereupon, the Hollan∣ders setting fire both upon the Town and Castles, departed, their revenge being to them instead of prey. The success at Gomera was not much unlike; for there an empty Town lay open to them, the Guns and other things which the People could not carry away with them in their flight, being buried under ground, and some who for hope of prey, went up into the Mountains, were slain to the number of fourscore, which was a great Victory to the weak multitude; and according to the Custom of Barbarians, they shewed great cruelty upon the dead and conquered Bodies, which when they had regained, they set all the Buildings they came to on fire. Douse seeing these his first hopes fait, and knowing there would be no need of so great an Army to wast the Coasts, he sent one part of the Fleet home with what prey was gotten, who happily escaping the Enemies Fleet (for at the same time that had set Sail from Corunna, and by and by separated by the boysterousness of the Weather: yet at last, in the middle of Autumn, they attained the Harbour. Himself, with the rest of the Forces, appointed to go to Brazil, a noble part of America, in pos∣session of the Portugueses, and abouning with a rich sort of Wood and Sugar. But chusing the Hesperides, and all Africa joyning upon the Ocean, as a safer Voyage, when he saw there many Novelties; particularly, money made of Shells, he wandred from thence, increasing his number, with some Merchants Ships, which he had taken coming from Spain, by some fatall Counsel, he chooses the Island of St. Thomas, a Colony of the Portugalls, for the refreshing his Men. They were invited to that place by the fresh waters, and Shell∣fish, called a Tortoise, which is no unsavory meat; and be∣sides, many times full of Eggs, which have so hard a Shell, as is not easily broken: There is also, an infinite store of Fish, which either for fear of other devourers, or through igno∣rance of humane covetousness, because no Fishermen come
thither, stick to the sides of the Ships. There were moreo∣ver some fowl, which being weary of flying, sit down of their own accords. This Island of Ethropia, which is called Guine, lyes in such a Climate, that the nights and dayes are equal, and tempers the heat of the Sun, that is alwayes per∣pendicular to them, and never so declining as to make any Winter; which part of this wide World, Antiquity asserted neither to bear Corn, Fruits, or Men, because those ages were ignorant of the Art of Navigation. But as experience teacheth, there is no part of Nature but is usefull some way or other, nor is the modesty of men such, as that they will leave the most barren and unhealthful soil unsearched for gain. The Circuit of the Island is almost round, where it is broadest, they reckon it but twelve leagues, the middle part is mountainous, over which clouds continually hanging with their dew, make abundance of Reeds or Canes to grow, out of which Sugar is taken; the profit arising whereof is so great as maintains the Portugueses, and imployes for each of them, a hundred or more servants. Here likewise groweth Ginger, and Trees whose juice exceeds the use of Wine, both for pleasantness of taste, and quenching the thirst. Here no man resisted them at their landing, the Town of Pa∣vousa after a light ickering was taken. Douse then gave notice to Francisco Menez that kept the Castle, That he was not come to Sea like a Pirate, but that he was sent with a well fur∣nished Fleet, by the most noble Captain Prince Maurice and the States, to punish both old and new injuries with a publick War, That he would do well therefore, not to make him (who had grea∣ter matters to look after) to stay there for one Garrison, assuring mercy and clemency to such as yielded, but punishment or death to them that continued stubborn; and so bringing thither some Artillery, the surrender of the place quickly followed. But the Islanders who were fled, making a great eruption, set fire on the Town, whose flames were suffred to expatiate to
the great ruine of others: for the Hollanders moved at the damage, as if it had been their own, scattered the fire up and down the fields and Villages. But Heaven it self fought most sharply for the Inhabitants, for an incurable and vio∣lent disease seized the Hollanders in their Tents, and pursu∣ed them with that malevolence and destruction as is hardly imaginable. Nor indeed shall I excuse them, as being so ignorant in things of nature, that they did not shun places ly∣ing directly under the stroke of the Suns heat and pestilenti Ayres, which though if find fit bodies naturalized therto from their very parents there, yet is not to be born by a peo∣ple not used thereto, and comming from parts much more North: for the Ayre there is neither cleansed, cooled, not refreshed with any Winds, and so by means of the untempe∣rateness, grows foul and corrupted with a dusky vapour, en∣dammages the earth, and this makes the countenances of the Portugueses that dwell there, to be of a pale wan colour, and the continual recourse of Fevers doth sufficiently argue, That even they that were born in a warmer Climate, do draw in a more dangerous Ayre. At first the Judges sent to inha∣bite this Island, only such as were condemned persons in Portugall, but now covetousness doth bring others thither voluntarily: Although it hath seldome been found, that any European born, ever attained there to his middle age. But the Seamen, besides the heat of the Ayre, being wearied with labour, were driven to remedies equal to the evills they suffred, for a deadly sleepiness, very noxious to such as went to take the cool Ayre at the rising of the Moon, and Sugar, and Indian Nuts, and other things causing a flux, they eat unmeasurably. And now the drinking of water too greedi∣ly, brought the disease full out among them, but whether it were corrupted by the fraud of men, I may worthily doubt, since it agrees with the malice of that Nation, and that not differing from reason. Another cause of their ruine was, their use of Venereal sports with some of the Women N∣tives
(the most of which are so libidinous, that they will en∣deavour to allure men into their embraces) in such diversity, that Nature was not able to bear such a traffique of bodies; thus they brought upon themselves several causes of death on every hand. This Pestilential mortality was made more no∣ted by the death of Duse the Admiral, who being of a very gross corpulent body was not capable of much motion in his natural climate, being, for two dayes rather languishing than sick, he dyed, not by any disease, but only by the melting of his fat, as was supposed. By whose death, all the common rabble were so troubled, that their hopes began utterly to droop, and soon after, the cry of all was, to leave that infe∣ctious place; and when consultation was had concerning revenge, It was thought sufficient that they intermingled their Enemies deaths with their own dangers. The body of their Admiral Douse, that it might not after their departure be made a laughing stock, they buried very deep under ground, all the ruines of the whole Town lying over him, they brought away their guns, and some Merchandise, and presently went to Sea; but yet they had not lost the infecti∣on, though they had left the place, for the Ayre changed ve∣ry slowly, and by degrees; and the poison of a disease, being once imbibed, will for a long time follow the infected; nay, the contagion and pestilent stench of the sick within the nar∣row compass of ships, made the disease more and more spread, insomuch that in fifteen dayes they lost above a thou∣sand men. After this, they began to hasten their return, ha∣ving got but small booty at Brasile, their number decreasing daily by several kinds of death, for upon whomsoever this e∣vil fell, if it once touched their Midriff or Diaphragma, they were dead even before they were sensible of the disease. O∣thers were burnt up with continual Feavers, wherewith if the head were once touched, presently they threw themselvs for madness headlong into the Sea. But now, as the Ayr grew more temperate, and fresh hopes began to appear to
these broken and sick men, another contagion, nothing bet∣ter then the other, seized them, before the former was quite cured, by which the joints of their knees, and their teeth were loosed, but it was not dreadful, because in long Navi∣gations it is an usual disease, yet to them it proved mortal at that time, because the joynts being yet very feeble, and they coming into more cold Climates of the Sea, where there was winter according to the Season of the year, were contra∣rily as much pinched with the Cold. Nor certainly of a long time had there been so sharp a frost, as was evident by the Rivers among us, which were wholly congealed although the Sea flowed ino them, and by the violence of it, some men were killed with cold. They were perplexed also with Tempests, which brought them into more then ordinary danger, in regard all the persons belonging to the Fleet were by reason of their weakness, unable to govern or manage them. Of all the number of Captains, only two survived, and some Ships did not bring home above six sound men apiece in them; not that there were so many sick, but that the rest were either consumed with diseases, or thrown over∣board into the Sea. Part of the Ships came and gathered new forces in England, others being dispersed, according as they were furnished with Sails, Tackle, and Marriners, re∣turned home almost at the end of Winter: one Ship was ut∣terly deserted for want of men, another being brought to Scluys, was taken by the Enemies. And this was the event and Success of the Hollanders Fleet, that had been so great a Charge to the Commonwealth for so long time, and at its return, filled whole Families with lamentations. But King Philip first sent his Fleet to the Fortunate Islands, for he had heard of the havock the Hollanders had made there, and commanded that they should not be suffered to continue their possessions there; but when it was known, that they left them voluntarily, it was ordered to go to Tercera, and there to be a Convoy for the American Plate-Fleet; where
arriving, they were quickly driven thence by the raging of the winds, and not without some damage. The Dunkirkers with great audacity robbing in our Sea, caused many complaints, some accusing the unskilfulness of those that were to preside the Naval Affairs, others the sloth and negligence of the Captains, and the unprofitable Tribute that was raised on pretence for clearing and purging the Sea; but at last, five of the Rovers Ships being taken, it was a comfort and satisfaction to the people to see Execution done upon the Pyrats. And many, either by force, vertue, or policy, getting safe out of Spain, when they came, filled all places with the terror and hatred of the Spanish name. Others returning happily and with good success from the Indies, brought more gainful Commodities then were usual. By the sme and report of which things, the peoples hopes increa∣sing, the loss of the Spanish Trade was not so much missed; for Salt began to be fetched from the Islands bordering upon America. About this time, Frederick Spinola brought some new aid to King Philip consisting of six great Ships, which were to be used against the Hollander, Covenanting to have all the Spoil he could take from them to his own use: for he was a man, Ambitious to equal in Warlike glory, his Name, and House, which was famous among the Genoueses, and wealthy among his Countreymen of Orens, who had increased both their Wealth and Honour by Arms. This part of the Spa∣niards Fleet was to come against the Hollanders, if the En∣glish with great care and high threats, which carryed much of∣terror, had not diverted them otherwhere; Therefore they came apart, after a short stay in Pontoyse, a Port in France; the weather exceedingly favouring them, for the Hollanders were forewarned of them, and had sent some Ships into the Brittish Narrow Sea towards Calais to intercept them; but they passing by the shore, came safe to Flanders, being favo∣red both by the Winds, and their own Fortune; yet they
were forbidden to go into Dunkirk, and therefore they went to Scluys, having in them one thousand six hundred Souldiers; from thence they threatened the Merchants and Coasts of Zeland; and these new kind of Vessels, that in these coun∣tryes had never been seen before, did no small damage, first in their charge about stopping up all passages, afterwards by small losses striking so great a terror far and near, that many fled out of Zeland, and sought new places to dwell in. But the event abated the fear; for although soon after Spinola's Ships, making use of a serene calm, and great silence, had taken one Ship of War belonging to Zeland, they being fit∣ted both with Native and hired Souldiers, that carrying scarcely threescore Marriners, yet did for the space of two hours defend it self on every side with that courage, that for twenty or thereabouts that were killed or wounded, there were two hundred and fifty slain on the other side, which cast a great fear on the Assailants part. And again setting upon some other Ships of War, mistaking them for Merchants Ships, with continual shot for six hours together, they were spoiled, and almost torn in pieces, which was a joyful sight to Flushing (so near was the contest to them). But Albertus the Archduke having finished his Nuptial Ceremonies in Spain, as he returned through Italy, the Pope Presented to him a Consecrated Sword, by vertue whereof he might the more boldly proceed against his Enemies on all hands. Not long after entring his new Dominion which he had so lately received as a Portion with his now Spouse Isa∣bella, comming over the Alps, and through Burgundy, while the War was in its heat, and his Affairs in no thriving con∣dition; in the beginning of Autumn he came and found Cardinal Andrew and Mendosa at variance, and attributing each of the prosperous successes of that year to himself, and the failings therein to the other; of whom, the Cardinal was dismissed to his Ecclesiastical business, but Mendosa still re∣tained in favour, and continued in his command; besides,
he saw Germany offended, and the Souldiers ready to mu∣tiny for want of their pay, which there was no visible means at present to raise for them; for the Netherlanders were poor, and a great Army together, with a prepared Fleet against the Hollanders and Germans, out of a dubious fear of them, as Enemies, had pressed upon Philip, and drained all his gar∣risons both in Spain, and the Islands. At Antwerp the Souldiers in the Castle required money. At Hamond (a free Town in the Bishoprick of Leige) and the places about, some Troops of Horse, and Regiments of Foot gathered Tribute both out of the Towns and Countrey, which was exacted from them with the threats and terror of Fire and Sword. The Garrison of Fort-Andrew having privately obtained a truce with Count Ernest of Nassaw, who kept the opposite bank, sent great threats to Boisledue and the adjacent places, unless they would pay them the Arrears of what was due to them for many years service. All these mischiefs the Princes found a foot when they came into the Countrey, and by their presence were so far from setling them, that new evils rather sprung up. The Nobility being inraged, that both in coun∣tenance and habit, the Princes were so Hispaniolized, and would be saluted by the Netherlanders with bending of the knee. And now as the Court grew burthensome even in time of Peace by Princely Revellings, and imperious Luxu∣ry; so its great expences added much to the increase of their penury, for remedy whereof the Deputies required great Tributes of every Province (which was alwayes very displeasing, but now first of all grew odious) adding, That it was unjust that they should bear greater burdens for their fide∣lity and reverence to their Princes, then the Rebels did for main∣tenance of their injury. Nor would any thing else be heark∣ned to, untill the Solemnities of installing the Princes were over, though the Brabanters urged Albertus his promise, That the Castles should be demolished▪ and the Forreign Souldiers sent away.
But Isabella affirming, That she was wholly ignorant of any such Agreement, was besides very angry; as if in those Demands, Liberty were sought against her Self: Moreover, the Walloons pray'd, That the Edicts might be taken away, whereby the Hollanders Merchandizes, so necessary for them, were forbidden: But these Things were onely spoken of, and so forgotten, with the Sense of their imposed Servitude, and the Rites of State being performed, the marryed Princes were received as Dukes and Counts; and, by chance, while according to antient Custom, the Oath for the Government of Brabant was administred without the Walls of Louvayn, two Villages, in sight of them, were set on fire, by some Horsemen of Holland, which was look'd upon as an Evil Omen, as beginning their Rule among Slaughters and Blood. And the United States were no less rejoyced at the Evil For∣tune of their Enemies, than they were troubled at their own; and being debarred of Trade with Spain, and also the Hostile part of the Netherlands, by the Edicts, and the French Peace, thereupon the flight of the Artificers diminish'd the Reve∣nues growing both by Sea and Land: Nor did the Tributes of that Year suffice for the Expence, although they were very high; and hereupon Moneys were forced to be taken up at Usury, sometimes equalling the Principal, nor were the growing Burdens less, so that the whole Chage of the War was turned against them; England also, that had been wont to help them, recalling their Souldiers, had summon'd their Ships also; but by and by, the Fear vanishing, Thanks were returned, and nothing else. At this time a potent Army, commanded by the Earl of Essex, harassed the Marishes and Boggs of Ireland, that were the last Subterfuges of their Liberty, with a Success in all his Publike Atchievments fortunate enough, but in his pri∣vate Undertakings not so happy: For being rather a fierce, than prudent Young-man and politikely sent into a Rugged Country among Enemies, having (through ignorance of the
places) received many losses, at last making a Truce with Tyrone, and returning Home without leave, found the Queen (from whom, before his departure, in a Contest, he had re∣ceiv'd a Blow wih her Hand, which he took with that Im∣patience, as if she had not sate in a Throne) during his Ab∣sence, by the Insinuations of his Emulous Adversaries, and the unwary Praises of his Friends, hardned against him with Suspitions and Fear; so that he was immediatly taken as a guilty person, and committed to Custody. Thus the pretended Fautors of Peace, prevail'd against the afflicted young Noble∣man, who had gotten Honour by War: That which shew'd the Queen's Inclination thereto was, That the Spaniard was unmoved at Sea, and that the Trade of other Nations coming thither were hindred: But the Queen pressed on that Coun∣sel, as long as she had any fear of the Enemies Fleet; al∣though an Embassador sent to her from Bruxels, assur'd her of safety, though all was in vain with a suspitious and incre∣dulous Woman: Nor did, in a secret manner, give Notice of this to the States, That both her Self, and the English her Subjects, had need of Peace to advance their Trading, and that she might establish her Kingdom, against the impious hopes of such, as laid Snares for her Old Age; yet, that they should not fail in their Courage, but as they equally shunned the Dominion of the Austrian and French▪ if they desired to keep her Friendship, they should retain their Liberty, or else give the Government of the Commonwealth to a Prince of their own; and that if she enjoyed Peace, she could easily supply them with many things, which now she was compelled to require of them. It is not hard to conje∣cture, how much many Mens Minds were moved at this decaying Alliance; and there were some Temptations used by the Emperour, who once again intended to send some to them to perswade to Peace. But They, by Resolute Advice, before the Embassadors were come to the Borders, wrote Letters, wherein They admonish'd Them to spare their un∣profitable Labour. Why They could not hope for a safe or
durable Peace, They had often declared, and they had at the present no Reason to recede from their former Counsels or Resolutions, unless perhaps the wickedness committed in Germany, and the Right of Trading broken off by Treachery, and the Spaniards holding the Netherlands, under the pre∣tended Names of the Arch-Dukes, should be taken as Incen∣tives to Peace. Thus wisely were all vain Discourses avoided, by the principal Authors of such daring Attempts to the Hol∣landers, who the Year following, in the doubling of their Pole-money out of their own Wealth, out went their Com∣panions, who either partly refused, or at best were very slow in following the Example. The Zelanders chiefly▪ refused to advance their proper Charge, by reason of some new or late Losses; and among those beyond the Rhine there were used many Evasive Circumlocutions, while part study rather the Peoples Favour than the Publike Good, and applaud those Impositions, which they hoped would be easie for themselvs, though they fell heavy upon their Neighbors. Others there were who would not be silent, when others being quiet, they had all the Care of the Commonwealth, although the Hollan∣ders winked at it, except it were seriously debated in Com∣mon-Council, they would leave the Care of the out-lying Parts, looking onely to their own nearer Necessities, and the possession of the Sea. Some Comfort was received from the German Princes, who, as yet having a Suspition and Jealousie of the Spaniard, offer'd them continual Aid and Money. The Count Palatine excited the rest of his Allies of the same Re∣ligion, both by Words and Example: Shewing to every one of them, what Alva had done of old, and what Mendosa now; and that the Hollanders could not b overcme without the destruction of their Neighbours; but if they flourished, they would be a great help to many; to this, for the Defence of Prussia; to these, of the Possession of the Dutchy of Cleves; and to all, against the Bishop of Rome and his Followers; by whose cruel Hatred and Faction all are oppressed. But all this was little hearkned
to; for the Duke of Brunswic converted his Arms against a City that had assumed too great a Liberty, the rest acknow∣ledging themselves unable to maintain the War: But Charls Duke of Sudermannia, Uncle of Sigismund King of Poland, who taking little Care of his Antient People of Sweden, and for his earnest Affection against the Romane Religion, su∣spected of Innovation, first opposed him in Arms, and after∣wards in a Publike Assembly, when the Kingdom was taken away from him; a long time shunning the Name of a King, yet usurping the Authority by other Titles, when he volun∣tarily desired the Alliance of the States, because he desired some present help, and that his hopes were uncertain, his Kingdom poor, and Forces far distant, he was for a time put off with Delays; yet because it was an offer'd Friendship, it was accepted, because he seem'd as it were to fight for Reli∣gion, making an Excuse, That some Holland Ships, without any Publike Command, had given Aid to Sigismund. The Ninth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1600.THE New Year, which closed up a Century, as it produced immediatly great Events, so it did seem to portend great Changes of Affairs for a long time: The Affairs of the Netherlanders, under the Princes, were in a bad Condition, and full of Trouble, and so wasted, as was hardly to be seen in other places: But the Goodness of the Princes as New, They in Authority being present, and the very greatness of the Distemper hastned to apply Remedies. The United States, to whom but newly redeem'd from Servi∣tude,
was accrewed an Ample Dominion, made all their Dan∣gers to be but stricter Bonds to connect them; being deli∣ver'd by successful Arms; although they had, since that, been reduc'd to no small Necessity, out of their Old Discipline retrain'd their Courage against their Enemy, but not equally their Concord and Modesty. On both Sides then were great and strong Endeavours, while, for above the space of Thirty Years, they contended to put an end to their Labour; with which hope they have prosusely wasted their Forces even to Extremity; as if Victory had stood before their Eyes, pro∣mising Reward to them that could hold our longest. And, first of all, the Winter being Frosty, the Hollanders escaped great danger, by reason the Rivers were all passable upon the Ice, from the Enemies seditious Mutinies, which they turn'd to their Advantage: For Lewis of Nassau, marching with great privacy out, with a select Party of Horse and Foot, broke into Wachtendone, a Town not far from the Borders of the Dutchy of Cleves, formerly taken by Count Mansfeldt, after a Two Moneths Siege, when the Duke of Parma had drawn the States Forces another way: The Horse, which had lately been added to that Garrison, for the preserving thereof, were then, by chance, absent, forraging about the Borders of the Bishoprick of Colen; yet there were theein 800 Souldiers; but the Ice of the Trenches was not broke; and the Situation of the Town far from an Enemy, and among Cities associated in Frienship, made them more se∣cure than usual; Therefore a few seizing the Rampire, with a small slaughter, they open'd the Gates to the rest: Then Geleno, both Lord and Governour of the Town, fled with some few into the Castle, in hope of Aid, which he had sent to intreat, and there endur'd the Terrour both of Granadoes and Bullets, thundred upon him; until Lewis his whole Party approached, and brought Scaling Ladders to the Works; and yet some resisted, and among them a Woman well grown in Years, not without the hazard and Wounds of those that op∣posed
them: But, at last, overcome by Multitude, they yielded this place, which was not of a contemptible Situation among the Marishes, and then was full of good Booty, because many of the Boors had betook hither Themselves and their Wealth, because the War raged all about those parts: After a few days the Souldiers brought in sufficient of all Things, both as to Victuals and Defence. Among the French, that fought for the Hollanders, was one Breautee, a Gentleman of good Birth and Bloud in Nor∣mandy, who, vaunting in his Youth, had challeng'd to fight 20 of Grebendoncks Troop; the chief of whom were infa∣mous, for the Treacherous Delivery of Gertruydenberg; and therefore certainly, this was an unbeseeming Contest for a Person of Honour: Each of them, with an equal Number, came out into a Field not far from Shertogenbosch, the Grob∣bendonkians being better Armed, but Breautee, more exact in his place and order: At the first Charge, Breautee kill'd the Enemies Leader, who was named Abraham, but was known in the Camp by the Nick-name of Cook; and so sharp was the Fight, and the Shot directed so rightly opposite, that in the first Conflict, on both Sides, the one half of the Con∣tenders fell; but, by the flight of the French, whose Courage began to fail, in the continuance of the Danger, Breautee being left alone, having oftentimes changed his Horse, and afterwards fighting on foot, at last overpressed with a multi∣tude of Enemies, yielded himself: The French affirm he ar∣ticled for his Life; against which the Brab under say, That by Agreement, the Conquered were to expect nothing but Death: But, certainly, being Prisoner, he had prevail'd much, when some, sent out of the City, kill'd him with 30 Wounds, while he onely begg'd they would let him dye Armed, and like a Man. A Wickedness fit onely to be committed by such ignominious Persons, and yet a good Lesson for magnani∣mous Youth; That they should not, under the false Title of Honour, affects those kind of Conflicts, from whence can
arise neither a profitable Victory to the Publique, and among Wise-men Death, in such a Quarrel, doth hardly deserve a Pardon. The Winter yet continuing, lest any occasion given by the Enemies Troubles among Themselves might slip, Prince Maurice, suddainly providing a Fleet, and dispersing other∣wise several Rumours of War, within  days forced the Ca∣stle or Fort of Crevecour, adjoyning to the Maes and Dies, to surrender. The Enemies Horse, that came thither too late to strengthen the Garrison, and were denyed Entrance at Shertogenbosh, that City always fearing Souldiers, were slain almost to the Number of 50. The Work about the Fort, augmented by Mendosa, were now finish'd by Prince Mau∣rice: From thence he went to the Fort Andrew, where the Germane and Walloon Souldiers, thrusting out their Captains, openly acknowledged a Sedition; and sending Balotte, who, under pretence of an Expedition, should allure them out, they escaped the Fraud, yet they held that strong Fort, not without hope of pardon, as a Pledge for the Arrears of Three Years Pay due to them; and for this they were more obsti∣nate against the Enemy, because a less price was offer'd them for their coming over, than they hoped to get, and yet saved both their Oath and Honour. There were some great Guns left there for resistance; the Rampire it self was like a Castle, wherein were two Fortresses or Batteries upon the Maes, and two upon the Wael; the fifth looking towards Harwarden: About the Trench, and beyond it, were conti∣nual Galleries, and then again a Trench, within which the Rivers were contained: In the strength of these Works, the Spaniards had so great Confidence, that Albertus, in his Letters and Discourse, boasted, That he possessed the Mouth of the Rivers, and that he had put a Yoke upon the Necks of the Hollanders. As long as the Syl overflowed by the Rivers, this Winter would not bear digging, being sollicited to come to Articles, they resolutely dened, and a Captive Souldier
being dismissed by Prince Maurice, to perswade them to a Surrender, was kill'd, in detestation of the Treachery, nor would seem to send the Body into the Camp. Whereupon, turning Counsel and Advice into Force, Prince Maurice thought nothing so fit, as to begirt the Besieged with a Camp, and to fortifie himself against Enemies from abroad: Whereof dismissing the Horse, whereof there was no use in those moyst and wet Grounds, he placeth part of his Forces in Ships, and upon Bridges, in the Fields of Tiel and Bom∣ and other small Islands in the Waell: The main of his strength he setled on the Edge of Brabant, and breaking the Bank, lets in thither the Maes, that he might have the more free space for Erecting his Works, and also stop the Enemies passage that Way: Besides, in six places he built Forts, with other lesser Bulwarks intermixt, whereby all passage to him was utterly cut off; and for increasing their Terrour, the Ca∣stle of Batenborg, situate at the Maes, and yet carrying some glimmering of the Old Name of the Hollanders in its own, formerly as far as the French Borders, was brought into sub∣jection, by the Battery of great Guns, whose Noise and Thunder the Besieged heard: And they were grievously wounded with Darts, yet unevenly thrown, and at uncer∣tainty, which the others returned to them again; and many of them being consumed, they were forced to seek lurking places under the Rampire: But the want of Wood and Medicines most afflicted them, the moysture of the over∣flowed Ground being very prejudicial to the Health of their Bodies. The Souldiers in the Town of Shertogenbosch kept up their hopes, by giving frequent Signs by Fire, and endeavouring to carry in ships, but in vain. The Army also came under the Command of Velasco, threatning great Things; but they could find no way to their Companions, the Fields being cover'd with Water, and the Forts opposing them. And now much of the Mountain Snow being melted, by the approach
of the Spring, and after their Rivers returned to their bounds, the Pioneers began to fall to work, especially, in the night, and when the Moon grew old; At length, they came to the Gallery, which we mentioned to be encompas∣sed with a Rampire. When the Souldiers, though they had not suffered the utmost extremity, yet being out of all hope of Relief, and Prince Maurice hastning to redeem the time, they came to Conditions, and one hundred twenty five thousand Florens were payd part of their pay due from the Enemy, which they divided man by man; For this price was that famous and well-builded Fort, bought, standing most conveniently for the defence of Holland, then the Cannon, and whatever else was therein, and one thousand two hundred Souldiers coming over to the Hollanders, who performing (according to Custom) all the Sign of joy, even They Themselves, tryumphed over Themselves. These men afterwards, did very good service, when giving over their licentiousness, they returned to the Discipline of War; yet they were for this thing proscribed as Traytors by the Ene∣my, which together, with hatred, and fear of punishment, put them in an excessive rage. If these things were not to be approved, before rigid Judges, certainly, these are more ex∣cusable then the Gertruydenburgers; for they, though de∣frauded of all their pay, for a long season, yet had stood out against a Camp, and a two moneths Siege, they do not complain upon just Causes, since they alter their obedience to good advantage. About this time, the States set out an Edict, that no one should reproach these new Souldiers for their transition, or coming over, as well understanding, that even for smaller causes, an Army hath sometimes fallen to intestine discords, as of late during this Siege, two Souldiers, the one a German, the other a Frenchman, quartelling at Dice, sell to fight, when of a sudden, each of their Country-men coming in to take parts, had like to have been the cause of great slaughter and
blood-shed; for scarcely could the contest be ended, even by the interposition of the States. About this time, the long pertinacy of the City of Groningen, having justly enraged those that emulated it, made the rest of the States fall upon sharp resolves, such as is scarcely usual among free people: the common people being in their own nature fierce, and having gotten Governours, that were exiles, during the rule of the Spaniards, and therefore be having themselves with the greater confidence towards the people, disdained to live under severer Laws now, then those that oppressed them un∣der the King, by whose connivence, they had obtained to have their Houses Tax-free, and some other things beneficial indeed to themselves, but prejudicial to the Inhabitants: who remembring these things, by the Decree of the United States, to whom they had subjected themselves, they would not agree, that many of the Priviledges they had nominally used, should be taken away from them: Besides, they had neglected for three years together, to bring their Tributes into the Treasury; and since, they could not without a most pernitious example, suffer their Judgments to be contemned, and their undertaken care to be depraved. Count William, though prone to mercy, is commanded with a party of Soul∣diers, by force, to reduce the Townsmen to their duty; but he moderated with prudence, the sharpness of this Com∣mand, by restraining the Souldiers from doing injuries, and taking no notice of the words of the incensed vulgar. Yet disarming the Citizens, lest while they remained in their fu∣ry, they should as formerly, fll to acts of Hostility, that he might not diminish his Forces, by leaving a great Garrison among them, he bridled them with a Castle, wherewith their courages were quite lost, for that from a City that had ever been free, they were now glad to receive a token of extreme servitude. 'Tis true, these things are usual with such as rule by force, nor could any thing more have been done to Ene∣mies: It was time certainly, to lay down the Arms which
they had taken up against Castles, if the Authours of liberty would rather chuse to imitate, than revenge such things: And they also desired, that part of the rest might be remitted to them; but the remembrance of old faults, had banished their long offered Clemency, especially considering at pre∣sent, their contempt and disobedience; yet the event mol∣lified, and abated the envy of this action; for the movers of these troubles, were afterwards carryed onely to the Hague, without any other punishment; and the Magistrates being translated to People of more peaceable temper, their right of suffrage in the Council, was restored to them, and all things afterwards transacted with equity. In Frizeland also, a great contention arose concerning Taxes laid upon Cattell and Pastures, the Townsmen urging it, and the Country-People that lived all over Eastergoo, and Westergoo, gainsaying it, so that soon after, out of an ambition of eminent Offices, which as is usual, nourished the diffe∣rences, came to that heighth, that part went to Faniker, while other part of them remain at Liewert, and both under pre∣tence of publike Counsel, distracted the Common wealth, and drained the Treasury: in which Affairs, Count William in∣terposing himself, and first calling the Authority of the Judges, and then taking Arms against those that were de∣parted, did not escape the envy of having affected the Go∣vernment, beyond the allowance of the Laws: At last, when the Associated Provinces all interposed themselves, the mat∣ter by the appointment of the Deputies, was re-setled in peace, according to the old form; as an addition to those evils, a sorrowful Messenger arrived, bringing tydings of a Treaty of Peace between the Arch-Duke, (to whom the Spaniard had left the managery of the Affair) and the Queen of England, whose Embassadors were then met together at Bulloyn. The truth is, both of them had cause enough to desire peace: the great undertakings, and bold attempts of the English, both in Spain and America, terrifying King
Philip, so that he was forced to the vast expence of great Fleets, to defend those far distant Navigations; and besides, it was hoped, the Hollander would be more ready to hearken to peace, when their hopes of Ayd from England, was ut∣terly quashed; But the English were fore-warned of their danger, by the successes of Tyrone, and new Rebellions and Commotions in Ireland, springing from a late Edict of the Pope; and the Forts of Ulster and Munster, being difficultyl regained, and with much labour, there yet remained severa lurking places in the Rebels hands. After three moneths, it was perceived that the Embassa∣dors could not be drawn to agree, the English refusing to be preceded, and the Spaniards hating to have any equalls; Nor was there any better progress by intercurent Messengers, while those as much fear a peace, as these desire it. Thus they parted at that time, and the Affair was left to be treated of in Writing, untill the Queens Death and Suc∣cessor, as we shall shew in its proper place, put an end thereto. In the interim, Embassadors came to the Hollanders, from the Emperour, because the States had sent Letters to meet them by the way, as to their Resolve concerning peace. These Embassadors, being Herman Count Mans∣feldt, and Charles Nuisell, came notwithstanding, pretend∣ing they had other things in Command. Their words seemed more to advance the Dignity of the Antient Empire, then the fortune of the former year merited: Namely That they should restore all places they held in Germany, and give sa∣tisfaction for the damages done by the Souldiers. That they should not defend themselves like their Enemies otherwise as they were equally guilty of the fault, so they should equally suffer punishment with their adversaries. That they would treat nothing of Peace, yet they should know, that Treaties could not be always waved, without great suspition, and that they would no longer bear the Taxes laid upon Commerce, which by pretence of the War should be continued; Hereto it was afterwards answered, and
not without desert, That the losses should be imputed, and the places taken for defence, be laid to the fault of them that first brought an Army into a peaceable Country; and if that were to be pardoned in the Spaniard, they hoped it would not make them more guilty, having been necessitated to do the like: As to the Islands of Gravewaert, and concerning Peace, they gave the same answer, which they had often before done; But be∣cause the Spaniard had relinquished Rees, it seemed con∣venient to them, that Emmeric also should be delivered, that so the Enemy might the more justly be blamed for the re∣taining of Bercke; Some Discourse there was at this time, of matters of less moment, a mention of a Truce being thrown in by the by, which the States gently denyed, as not suitable to the times. And a Trumpeter desiring a safe Con∣duct for Deputies, which were sent by the States under Al∣bertus his obedience to the United States, concerning a Peace, being for some dayes retained, that they might not discover the great preparations for War, that were then on foot, was commanded soon after to carry back Letters, wherein, be∣fore they would speak of Peace, they admonished them, first to free their Country from foreign force; for after it was determined with the Souldiers in Fort-Andrew, it fell out, that the rest in those parts, moved with no less madness, acted things no less disadvantagious, so that the States of the United Provinces, supposing it necessary to make use of the Enemies discord, bent their studies to greater undertakings. The War now being transmitted into Flanders▪ was attended with very great want, and scarcity of all things, which was both the cause and nourishment of Seditions; for they knew nothing could more straiten the Treasury, nor put their troublesom Affairs into a greater confusion, then to possess that Country, which was most abundant in all products of the Field, and in a manner, wholly belonged to the Enemy; it was also full of Ports and Harbours, from whence the Sea might either be infested, or guarded, and commerce, for the
support of daily charges, secured; The Zelanders before all the rest required, that they might not be left open to the dangerous Neighbourhood of the Enemy, more then they beyond the Rhine, and in Holland it self; That Ostend might be freed, and those of Thieves, Newport, Dunkirk, and Scluys taken: If they did but surprize one Town, while the Enemy was gathering together his Forces, and while he could entreat them to action, they should easily bring it to pass, that for the future, they might make the Enemies Country the Seat of the War. And to this purpose, they hasted their preparations with a great confidence, to be ready as soon as the Wind should favour them; and while it conti∣nued North, which is directly against them, the Forces from all parts, and the Provisions, did but slowly meet together, the General Assembly being appointed at Zeburge, a Castle in Walcheren; There were 127 Companies of Foot, and 25. Troops of Horse, with a Train of Artillery, and all other Warlike Furniture, together, with a Fleet of 800 Vessels: Here it was debated between the Prince, and the Deputies of the Provinces, who being the main motives of this Expedi∣tion, offered themselves to him, as Companions, and As∣sistants of his Counsels and dangers, whether they should expect a prosperous time to set Sail in, or while the Enemy was unprovided, lay hold on occasion: which later opinion prevailed: But the Carriages, and other Provisions going by Sea, onely the Souldiers, with four great Guns, were wafted beyond Honte, the furthest part of the Schelde, from whence they marched by Land, to Ostend, a Town scituate upon the Sea-coast, and in the States power, but inclosed by the Enemies, with even Forts, to prevent excursions, where∣with the Garrisons therein had vexed the Country, in the ex∣acting Tributes from them; nor were the Souldiers by all those Forts so restrained, but that yet sometimes they would break out.
Hither, that they might the more safely come, Count Er∣nest of Nassau was sent before with some part of the Fleet, to assault the Philippines, a Fort in that part, the Garrison where∣of being forced to surrender, and marching out, when As∣sened also was departed, the Prince so disposed his Army, that George Count Solmes, Ernestus of Nassau, with part of the Fleet, and Vere General of the English, all had distinct Forces, and Govern'd the Army by a Tripartite Command, the Horse being distributed into 7 Bands, over which Lewis of Nassau had the Chief Command; for he being design'd to the chief Managery of the Affair, had none to partake with him in his Authority. But the Country-men, being ter∣rified with the Fame of the approaching Army, fled on all hands from the scatter'd Villages, leaving them desolate; and so far were they forgetful both of taking part, as former∣ly, in Defence of Liberty, that they took prisoners all Soul∣diers they could meet with, at unawares, or by Treachery; and upon such as were thus taken exercised all Acts of Bar∣barism: Whereby, the Fury of the Army became so incen∣sed, hat they burn'd the Dops and Villages, far and wide, in their Passage and progress: Their Course was steer'd di∣rectly to Bruges by Eckelo, Maldegem, and Malca, Vil∣lages of Note: Letters from the States were sent to Bruges, and also to Gaunt, to put them in mind of their Antient League and Friendship, whereby they had jointly Covenanted against Forein Dominion and Tyranny: And unless they were willing to submit to their present Slavery, They doubted not but They would assist them both with Forces and Money. These Letters they receiv'd, but with so much disdain and rancour of Mind, that, as it were in despight, they of Bruges accepted a Garrison from Albertus at that time, which till then they had constantly refused; and with their Cannon infested the Army as it passed by, though not to any great damage, yet not daring with any Parties to come near to skirmish.
Prince Maurice passing thence to Jabec, was told that the fort of Oldenburg was deserted by Albertus his men; the like also was reported of Plassendale, Snaskerk, and Bredenede: In these places, as also in all other convenient for passage, the Prince left Garrisons, such as should suffice to Repulse any small Parties of the Enemy; and that the Enemies Counsels might be the more diligently inquired into, and In∣telligence received, being uncertain what to prepare, since none could expect a well-order'd Army, among turbulent, and disagreeing persons. Count Solmes with one third part of the Army, was com∣manded to go before to Ostend, and conduct ino that Town the States Deputies, that they might with the more safety consult of the surther manage of the War; which done, he besieged Fort Albertus, which was distant from Ostend a∣bout an hours journey towards Newport, among the Sand-hills upon the Sea shore. Passing hence to Newport, he prepa∣red all things for a Siege, having taken the Works at the Port, which falls down to the Sea a great distance from the Town. In a short time the Prince came thither with the rest of the Forces, intending to incompass the Town as much as the nature of the place would bear. In all this Journey the Souldiers had enough of all things but only drink, for the Cattle where ever they were met with being taken away, was the cause that both Wine and Beer was very sparinly brought to the Army; nor could they alwayes get water, in∣somuch that some not only looked for, but greedily drank foul and dirty water; yt the damage of the Slaves and Ser∣vants waiting on the Army, somewhat mitigated this penury, for Spinola's Ships had taken upon the Sea twenty Vessels loaded with that sort of people, and by their own sloath and negligence, while they might have waited for the Fleet that was to conduct them, whereby to prevent being made a prey to thers: but this proved no great damage to the Publick, nor did the Enemy long keep the glory thereof, for the
whole Fleet afterwards bring assembled under Admiral Warmonde, the Wind immediately rising, those Ships being utterly useless, but in calm Weather, were shattered with great loss and damage. At which time happened a new thing, for one of the men that rowed, being a Turk by Na∣tion, by the shot of a bullet, was freed from his Chains with∣out any hurt to his person, so that leaping into the Sea, and swimming over to the Hollanders, by a happy temerity esca∣ped a perpetual misery. Among all these things, Albertus perceiving that this was no tumultuary Band that came to Forage, but an orderly Army under command, and that the whole burden and force of the War was now going into Flanders, and there to devour the very bowels of the Go∣vernment; casting away all other hopes, he gathers toge∣ther his Forces from all parts, as resolving to meet so great a hazard of War with his whole Forces. Nor doth he leave any thing undone that might hasten forward his design, for first he called back the Regiments he had sent into Gelder∣land, then gathered together all that lay about Antwerp in a running Band, and all that were quartered in that part of Flanders and Brabant, where the Schelde divides them. Care also was taken for appeasing those seditious Spaniards in Hamount, who being translated thence to Diest under hopes of money to be there paid them, and having other provision made for them, at length by little and little returned to their old obedience. And though there was a necessity of asso∣ciating as many as possible, for that otherwise the number of the forces would be too small, yet still there remained a fear of their seditious humours, but at last being won by prayers and promises (which is often soen in War), that they would lend their helping band to the repelling this common dan∣ger, they yet retained their discords, yet so as that the Ene∣my should not rob them of their reward. But the Italians who succeeded the Spaniards, both in Homant, and the cru∣elty of their redition, would not slir thence, as suspecting
that if they got the Victory, yet they should be little advan∣taged thereby, but that by their deaths the Princes would be great gainers. The number of all they could gather into a body was but ten thousand Foot, and sixteen hundred Horse; with these as fast as so great and heavy a Body could be moved, the Arch-Duke himself went, not relyihg on the Care or For∣tunes of others herein: In their Journey, they made a Halt it Gaunt, where the Arch-Dutchess Isabella came to them, not affrighted with the Noise of War; and beseeched them, That they would not leave her in this extremity of danger, and frustrate her in the top of her hopes. But turning particularly to them of Drest, she said many Things, both concerning the time and matter in hand; and that she might raise in them the greater Confidence, laying her Hands upon her Ear∣Rings and Jewels she protested, She would first part with all those principal Ornaments of her Fortune and Honour, than that the well-deserving Souldier should want a Reward, much less go without his Pay. At once the News of the Enemies approach, and the dan∣ger growing to them in the next Forts thereby, arrived at Prince Maurice's Army; so that some strucken with the force and Terrour of this so suddain coming of the Enemy, fled from the said Fort: For they that were to defend Plasendale and Bredenede, being but few in number, would not so much as see the Enemy: But they that held Oldenburg part of them being gone out to Forage, and so the Garrison weakned, yielded up their Charge: The same did they that were left at Snaskerk, surrendring the place, upon Articles for Life: But the Fury of the Rout, thinking it long till they embrued their hands in the Enemies bloud, contemning the Laws of Arms, and the Religion of their Chieftain, who had signed the Articles, fell upon them, and kill'd them all. The blame of this wicked Cruelty he cast off from him∣self upon the Seditious Souldiers; and this was done, either
to make them hated and odious, or else these disobedient men really thought to make amends to their Prince, for their dubious Fidelity, by their perfidious Treachery upon their Enemies: It was Night, when the Report of this matter came to the Prince's Ears, and the Terrour thereof frighted the rest, who had foreseen nothing less: Nor do I suppose them dis-ingenuous, who believe that the Hollanders Affairs, had not for many years, been in the like danger: 'Tis true, there were Forces, which were, without doubt, considerable to their Party; yet the gallantry of the Captain was more than the greatness of the Forces: All the Country round about was Hostile; and now the Enemy was at hand, it was too late to fortifie the Camp; nor indeed would it avail them, who were ready daily to be surprised with Hunger: for Provisions could not be expected from Ostend when the Enemy would lye between it and them: To fly into France, would be no less base and cowardly, than doubtful and dan∣gerous: And if they should stay for the Enemy drawing nearer and nearer to them every minute, the Souldiers being dispersed in the Siege, so that the very Port might be taken from them, it would rather seem to be a Slaughter, than a Battail: Yet for all this, the Prince laid hold on one hope, which onely remained, by the Opinion of all the Comman∣ders in Chief, and other Officers, (the great and famous Day for Battel being not yet come) sent Count Ernest with 10 Companies of Foot, 4 Troops of Horse, and 2 great Guns, that by taking the Bridge at Leffingen, which one single Pas∣sage was stit open, the Enemies passage might be stopped to∣wards them: but if that could not be effected, they should yet make them for a while delay their progress, until he pre∣pared his Army, and took Counsel further what to do. But Count Ernest, though speeding all he could, found the Enemy passed those Streights, and out of hope onely to wear out some time, with the two great Guns he had brought with him, commodiously planted to that purpose, be assailed the
Enemy; who at first, doubting lest all Prince Maurice his Army were come to give him Battel, but finding it otherwise, drawing his men into a more compact Order, and consider∣ing how far his Forces excelled the Enemy in number, grew very fierce and ardent to sight: Nor was the like Courage and Resolution wanting in them on the other side; but by the inequality of Men, they seemed rather to have taken Counsel to fight, than by fighting to have conceived an hope of Victory: For, at first, with singular Testimonies of E∣minent Valour, they were compelled to Retreat, and soon after to fly; so that there were slain 800 Men, part of them fighting, part after thy had Quarter given them, the Victo∣ry growing to that heighth of Fury, that they would spare none. This Slaughter (as it often happens) was the means that all the rest of the Army were saved: For while the Enemy was busie in following the Chace, and pillaging the Field, Prince Maurice got time, first to transpose his Horsemen, and afterwards his Carriages, into that part of the Sea-Coast, which looks towards Ostend: During whose passage, if the Enemy had come upon them, there must needs have follow'd a very great slaughter: But he being grown more slow by his Security, and measuring the whole Event by the former Fight, sent Messengers into the Neighbouring Cities, that a great part of Prince Maurice's Army was slain in the Fight, and himself, with the rest, inclosed by Them. Which Letters being read, many of the same Cities, applauding their For∣tune, with an over-hasty Joy, posted to make Solemn Orations in their Praise, and to decl their Exaltations, by all expres∣sive Signs of rejoycing: Ine into , the Foot, and the Remainder of the Horse, so B shewing them a Ford not far from the Sea, in two Bodies  over a Bridge made somewhat nearer the Town, where the Haven is more narrow.
The Prince, as he carryed any over, still placed them in Order of Battel, yet hiding from the Souldiers the loss of the former Fight. In the Van-Guard was Sir Francis Vere, with a double Band of English and Frizons, and two Ensigns more, the one belonging to the Prince, the other to Count Hohenlo, who was absent, being to guard Holland; the Middle Ward, or Bat∣tel, was made up of French, Switzers, and the New Soul∣diers from Fort Andrew; and of this Count Solmes had the Leading. The Rereward consisted of Hollanders and Ger∣mans: the last of which, was all that remained of Count Ernestus his Forces: There was also a Bard of Utrechers, Commanded by Collonel Ʋctrembrouch. The Horse were partly in the Front, other part attended the Battel, and some waited upon the Rear-Guard. Thus the Prince order'd his Army, according to the Antient Policy of famous Cap∣tains. and then commanded the Ships to depart, which by this time were in great Number come to him, and to steet their Course to Ostend; That the danger being equal to all, so all hopes or causes of flight should be utterly taken away; but they which had setled themselves in the Haven before, could not presently obey that Order, until they were assisted by the Tide: Besides, some Companies were left about Newport, to keep in the Souldiers there, that they might not break out on the Bank of the Prince's Men, when they were engaged to fight. And now the Morning being half pssed, and Noon approaching, the Enemies Horsemen, going a great distance before their Battel, came in sight; and after some short Skirmishes with Pistols, being driven from the Shore, retreated to the Hills, where a Band of Foot-men tarryed for them; against whom, moving in a slow pace to∣wards the Sea, the Cannon on both sides plaid very fiercely. Some there were with Prince Maurice, who advised, at that time, to meet the Enemy, for that would inflame the Soul∣diers Valour, and increase their Courage and Alacrity. But
others, with more Wisdom, that it was more fit to abide in the same place, whereby they might repel the more easily the Enemies Fury, after their long March over the difficul∣ties of the Sands; which when they had concluded, and the Horse dispersed, which had taken away the Prospect, Prince Maurice, from the Tops of the Hills, which he had possessed for his Advantage in the Battel, spyed the Enemy drawing nearer, and in this manner ordered: There were Three Bat∣tels, according to Custom, of which the Middleward being double fill'd the whole breadth of the Shore, wherein were four great Bodies of Pikes; to each of which were added as Wings both greater and lesser Shot, which we call Muske∣tiers and Bow-men: They of Diest, under many Captains, having but one Standard, made the first Battel, wherein Men∣dosa was present: The Right Wing of the second Battel, which consisted all of Spaniards, was commanded by Mon∣teregio and Villars; The Left, made up partly of Italians, was order'd by Sapena and Avilos: Between these Two Bodies, was a select Number of Horse, which were the Arch-Duke's Life-Guard, appointed to stand: In the last place were the Netherlanders led by Barlotte and Bucquoy, with Auxiliaries out of Ireland, whose Captain was Bastuck. The General of the Horse, by reason of Landriano's infirmity, was Peter Galen; onely they of Diesl had their own Offiches, whose power was no more over them than at pleasure: And as they differ'd in Language, or their Arms, being either Lances, Guns, and Breast-Plates, so were they drawn our and disposed into Troops. The Day decaying, as the Battels grew nearer each to other, the wiser Spaniards thought fit to take Advice, Whether they should engage in a general Battel and try the doubtful Chance of War: For they did not find (as was believed) the Enemy hastning his slight into the Ships, or running away, but standing with Resolution, to sell their Lives, and revenge their Deaths.
Thus the Battels being prepar'd, and all the Souldiers on both sides, encouraged to fight; That whoever was the Con∣querour, could not but expect great effusion of bloud: They were to take care, that they did not drive him to hope, who being una∣wares fallen into so great Dangers, was brought to such a condi∣tion, that he could not fear or decline fighting: That they had better besiege him, since all the Countrey was theirs, and the Ene∣my had no place of Retreat: In the mean while, the Souldiers should rest themselves, being wearyed with long Journeys, and one onely Fight. But there were others of Opinion, That they should make it their first care and business, to recover the Fort Albertus, before spoken of. And besides, the Minds of the Souldiers were so elate I with the success of the former Battel, that they believed they were come thither rather to take Prey, than to fight; that old saying of the Spaniards be∣ing frequent in the Mouths of most, The more are the Moors, the more glorious the Victory: Nay, it was almost come to that, That they would not go off without Battel, though the Enemy seemed to decline the same. And many of the Commanders thought that Alacrity of the Army, and vehemency of their Minds, was to be encouraged; wherefore, laying aside all further delay, which was look'd upon rather as specious, than advantagious, They thought fit, by Exhortations, to raise the Souldiers Courage already inflamed, That they would per∣fect the Victory already begun, increase the Spoils already gotten, and not onely slay the main Body, but the very Remains of that Army, begun to be Conquer'd by them: That they themselves were men practised in Fights, those ignorant, and Rebels to God and their Prince till this time, having received so great presum∣ption as to pitch their Colours against Us, on purpose onely to be destroy'd, and are at this time ready to fight, because they can find no means ready to fly: Here are no Ditches to pass, no Rampires to scale, nor any Defences for Sloth or Cowardise; but as Out∣casts they come out of their lurking places, having nothing but Arms, and those depraved and made of no force by the guilt of
their Consciences: That it now lay in their (viz. the Spanish Armies) hands, to make their Prince as great as they would have him, for this one day would fully restore his Dominion to him, if they would strive for the Victory; nor should there be any further occasion of War, for this would be the first and last Battel: 'Tis true indeed at Turnholt, they kill'd some of the Spanish Army; but, what were they? such as chose rather to run away, than to meet the Enemy; neither, at that place, was there either a Battel, or an Army, or a Prince; whereas, at this time, he, for them they fought, should be a Witness of their Valour, whose great Victories at Calais, Hulst, and Amiens, they should call to Mind, and each of them take Example from his Valour, Constancy, and Industry. These were the general Exhortations used by the Nobles to all; but to the Spaniards they were more particular, re∣peating to them many famous Acts, both of antient and later Times; inciting them, by the Honour of their Ancestors, who were not content with European Victories, but proceeded in their Conquests to unknown Worlds, and made another part of Nature by their Arms, whereby their Empire might become immense and boundless, by their Duty to their King, whom they should believe present in person with all his Sol∣diers, to attest their Deeds, and desire them not to relinquish his Sister, nor his Kinsman poor and contemptible; but that they should go on cheerful, and fill'd with hopes; that it might be made manifest, that there wanted not Courage, but Enemies, which had caused the protracting of so long a War, against one single Province. Some also there were that Vowed, That they would not spare one Enemy his Life, be∣sides Prince Maurice and his Brother, whom they thought worthy onely to be kept for a Triumph. No less did Prince Maurices Commanders, with various speeches, as seemed to each most convenient to encourage their men. To the English, was set forth the common dan∣ger,
and their constant allyance both in Arms and Religion; the French were provoked by their natural hatred of the Spaniards, and the fresh memory of the troubles wherewith their Country had by those been embroyled: to the Switzers and Germans, the name and honour of their Nations, was a sufficient incentive, that they would transmit to their Poste∣rity, the same Nobility for Valour and Vertue, which they received from their Ancestors, and to remember, that in defending the liberty of others, they strengthened and main∣tained their own; Here the Souldiers of Fort Andrew, were admonished to give an experiment of their fidelity, there they stirred them up, by the injurious Language of the Spaniards calling them Renegadoes, and affirming them un∣worthy of any benefit from the Law of Arms: The Prince himself did not refrain speaking to his Brother, (for he would always be inseparably with Him, and at this time, could not be wrought upon by any Intreaties to retire to the Ships) to whom he said, For you truly Brother, I grieve and pity, since the event of War is uncertain, and this thy Age ought not to be more safe for its own sake, than for thy Countries: I know not by what fate, you are engaged with me in this danger, where the Com∣monwealth, which we equally defend with our Arms, is at once endangered to be deprived of all her hope: But since it is come to that, that there is no place for us to fly, if we be vanquished, and that we see the Eyes of all those bent upon us, as expecting from our actions, some remarkable evidence of Honour and Vertue. Let us go on to the Battel with such a Courage, as may give us hope of Victory, but not to fear death in the attaining thereof; This will become you and me, and all that belong to the Noble Family of Nassau. A proof whereof, you see, is now required from your self. Surely I rejoyce, and so will your Country, to see the Cou∣rage and Resolution, which makes you rather to cast your self upon your Fortune and Valour, then the safe retirement of the Fleet: Here he ended, and then riding up and down to all that were near him, and calling them by the sweet and blandient
Title of Sons, he beseeched God to be present, to take a just revenge upon those who had by perjuries, so often contemn∣ed his Majesty. The Authour of the War, having with him the same Enemies, which destroyed the same Cause, Reli∣gion, Laws and Faith, which they pretend to maintain; That, whatever the Enemies Forces had, either of Valour or Disci∣pline, they had it from him; for they were generally with∣out order, without experience in War, and no less hated by their Friends, than their Enemies: at variance among them∣selves, mutually suspecting each other, lest either of them should gain by the Conquest of another. Nor are they at this time, brought ready to fight by any thing more than an over-heady rashness, which being once spent, and repressed, con∣tinually languisheth, till at last, it becomes nothing: Have we not found the very people, in the ambiguity of Affairs, wavering, in adversity fearful, and in prosperity neither to be kept in awe by Law or Justice. Wherefore now, let us revenge our selves, if not for revenge sake, yet because there is a necessity that exacts it; On this hand is the Ocean, whose Waves are merciless, and will spare none: On the other, stands the Enemy, breathing forth cruelty and perfi∣diousness; and therefore you must either overcome that Foe, or resolve to perish: Lastly, coming to the Frizons and Hollanders, he exhorted them to remember the Com∣mon-wealth, which had been built and cemented with the blood of their Fathers and Kinred, and of late increased by so many great Victories: And as the proud domineering of the Spaniards was obvious to their Eys; how much more intolerable would the slavery be to them, when conquered, than of old, when they were yet unbridled. The Contest was not at this time for their own; or their Ancestors glory (though there may be a Reason why valiant men should set a light esteem thereon) but for safety; nay what was to be preferred before safety or liberty; for now they fought for their Wives, their Parents, their Children, their Country,
their All; For at this time, were all these to be vindicated Having thus spoken to the Souldiers on every part, he imme∣diately prepared to begin the Battel; and to that purpose, commanded two of his six Cannon to be carryed and plant∣ed upon a hilly Ground, which the Seamen, a People used to labour, presently with great force applying themselves to, brought to pass, notwithstanding their great weight, the troublesomness of the Sea, and steepness Of the Cliff, lay for a platform under them Hurdles and Planks: No less hast, did the Enemy make to bring his Cannon which were eight in number, and to plant them upon the shore: which done, at the Thunder of their discharge on both sides, the Waves of the Sea danced, and the Neighbour-shore trembled with the horrour of the noyse; The Bullets, which could fall in no empty place, glutted themselves with a plentiful slaughter; yet Prince Maurices Men suffered the least loss for the Ene∣mies Artillery stood upon plain ground, and had little bene∣fit by their Carriages: The Holland Fleet also offended the Enemy with their shot from the Sea, which when he per∣ceived, the shore now growing narrower, because the Tyde of Flood came in, he drew his Battel more inwards towards the Downs; all the whole Coast and Fields, are full of little Sandhills, for a long space of Ground, which make the place uneven; to which part, the heat of the Fight was transfer∣red, which for a great while, continued bloody and dubious, as either the advantage, or disadvantage of the place, helped or hindered; but afterwards▪ the Captains on both sides opened their Battels as much as the ground would give leave: the Vallies and tops of the Hills, were possessed by the Infantery, in the plainer part of the ground, being some∣what more distant, was the Cavallery ranged: But Albertus that he might extend his Forces, the middle Battel being commanded to march forward, what before was the Van-Guard, became now the Right Wing, and the Rere-ward the left-Wing; For putting his greatest confidence chiefly in
the Spaniards, and next them the Italians, hoped the Enemy would not be able to sustain the Force of that double Band; But the Prince opposed against the Enemy towards the Sea, Sir Frances Vres men, and next to the Fields, the French, the rest he placed behind as Reserves: And now the Enemy sent out from both Bands some small shot, which as soon as it was perceived, four Companies of French were drawn forth, three of which were to fall on the Enemies left Wing; for General Vere with some Select men of his own, was set for∣ward against the Right; protesting to the Prince, either by life or death, to merit thanks that day: Nor was he de∣ceived; for he fighting among the thickest, and having beaten back the Musketiers, and assayling a great stand of Pikes, he received two wounds, had his. Horse killed under him, and was mounted on another; and upon the Arrivall of his Brother, Sir Horace Vere with fresh Forces, magna∣nimously brought his men safe off. At this time, the Enemies Horse (which had been placed as Wings for strengthning the Foot) violently falling into the Flank of the Statesmen, made a great slaughter: whereby it happened, that the Spa∣niards Courages were encreased, and the Nassavians began to faint; upon which sight, the Enemy falling on more vio∣lently, suddenly a Panick fear and flight, surprised all on that part of the Army, with so inconsiderate trepidation, that many of them for fear of the Enemies Sword, ran into the Sea, and there met a shameful and certain death; But the constancy of the rest, and the Prince himself, who was care∣ful of all things, quickly restored that want of Courage. The French came in opportunely, to supply those that were in di∣stress; and for the better doing thereof, were divided into two Bands, by the care of the Count Solmes, and the Cap∣tains Ommerville and Saul. And these falling on at first at the push of Pike, had good success by the help of the Muske∣tiers, who standing in the higher places, powred their Bul∣lets uncessantly upon the Enemies Pikes standing below,
which wounded and galled them infinitely. And when an intire Body of Netherlanders and Irish Souldiers advanced against them, Count Solmes commanded the Switzers, and Souldiers of Fort-Andrew, to give on upon them, which they did with great Courage, and while they were in the heat of Fight, he sent both the Batavian Regiments, to wit, one of Utrecht, the other of Holland, to their assistance, and last of all, the Germane Souldiers put themselves into the Fight. For Prince Maurice thought it convenient to assault the Ene∣my with shot, and to renew the Fight in as many places as they could, so as they that were tyred in the Fight, might have time and place to retreat, and fresh men still come to supply their places, and this very thing broke the Enemies strength, and made the other not to be Conquered; for there was room reserved for recruiting the Forces in Fight, so that the Enemy still encountred with fresh men, as often as he offered, unwarily to pursue any that fled; But among the Hills, there was one continued Fight, especially where they grew less; and also beyond, by intervals, the Fight was re∣newed: When the Foot met at first, Lewis of Nassaw, with six Troops, which were followed by three others, fell in, and routed the Enemies Horse: At which time, one Gentleman, who Commanded the Princes Guards, persuing those that were routed, had passed all the Enemies Forces; And three other Horse Commanders, led their Troops against the Spa∣niards: Nor did Count Lewis, who was diligent to lay hold upon all occasions to get advantage, neglect to take six Troops of Cuirassiers, and with them, to charge the Enemy afresh. In many Conflicts this day, did that great Commander shew his Valour, until the Spanish Horse Rallying, and com∣g in on all sides, had almost inclosed him, being followed at that time, by not above ten men of all his Company, but the constancy of his own Resolution, and the Captain of a Troop (named Cloet) came in season, and saved him from
that imminent danger. In the mean time, they who had for∣merly gone out of the Battel, to be refreshed and comfort∣ed, came in again, and began the Fight anew, whose both appearance and Fortune, (the Battel being in many places) was various and different. Sir Horace Vere in the Playn, at the end of the Hills, with six Companies fighting the Spa∣niards, and others in other places, as every one found, or could get an advantage; so that it seemed, as if the Fight had been every where scattered, and as fresh Forces, or a new Enemy, met on either side; so did the Victory as yet continue uncertain, now inclining to one party, anon to the other. But among the Horse, the quarrel was sooner deci∣ded, it easily appearing, that the Mauritians would be Victors, even from the Courage of the Commanders, for the Enemies best Souldiers were absent, as Contrera in Spain, Landriano by reason of sickness; And now the Spanish Lancters, turning head, sled to Newport, the Nassavians pursuing them in the Rear: yet for all this, the Foot kept their ground, and fought successfully enough, even among the little Hills, from whose tops they beat the Princes Men, coming even to their Cannon, which were placed upon a little Hill not far off, as is before related: Three hours did the Battell continue with equall Courage on both sides, du∣ring all which time, there was nothing seen but death, re∣presented in the most hideous shapes of horrour, great effu∣sion of blood, and both near at hand, and far off, nothing but terrible spectacles of horrour and dying: And then at length, the fury began to abate; and because at the begin∣ning of the Fight, most of the Souldiery was fighting, through extremity of labours their Bodies began to grow faint, onely the PRINCE infused Courage into his men, from the hopes of Victory.
Here he busied himself in rallying such as were out of order there, as often as any Enemy appeared to be made ready, fresh Bands to encounter him; and in another place, he was not wanting to incite all, undantedly to go through the residue of the fight. At last, towards evening, he re∣solved to conclude the Battel with the Horse, in that part of his Army being irresistable: to this purpose, he sent two Troops, to stand upon the Sea-shore, near the great Guns; one of these belonging to Sir Frances Vere, the other to Captain Bale: These he directed to charge the Enemy, nor did his hopes fal him, because from hence, according as he fore-judged, began the first appearance of Victory; for the Enemy willing and earnestly desiring to put an end to the Fight, came directly against them. But the great Guns thundered upon them with that fury, that they were forced to retreat, with a great slaughter both of Horses and Men; yet fetching a compass about the next Hills, and running further, returned to the Sea-shore, until the Mauritians at∣tending the Artillery with great fury again, powred shot upon them as they advanced. By which means, the Enemies Horse being utterly beaten off, presently the Foot-Regi∣ments were set upon, and roued, and their Colonels Sapena and Villars, taken alive. On the other side, the unwearied Valour and Vertue of the Prince, his present Counsel; yea and his very counte∣nance, made his Souldiers Conquerours, while he would not suffer them to be overcome: which when the Spaniards saw, who fought in the middle Battel, although they were yet equall, or rather more strong than the other, being terrified with the fortune of heir friends, stood very tremblingly: nor were they wearied out onely with the common troubles of a Fight; but by the provident care of Prince Maurice, had more than they could bear. Their eagerness of spirit; by the abating of Courage, being wholly eaten up by fear. For the Sun which was opposite to their faces, was made use of
to blind them; so was the Wind, which was higher than ordinary in Summer, to drive into their faces, the smoak and the Sand: 'tis true, they endeavoured to have gotten that benefit of the Heavens to themselves; but Prince Maurice being every where ready to prevent them, hindered their design, and by this means also, their Guns were useless to them. The Mauritians during the time of the Battel, had so bestirred themselves, and lost so little time, that each of them had made thirty shots; and they which were at the Planked battery, did as much harm as those that were upon the firm ground: The Enemy had not the same advantage, and their Cannon being neither raised nor well planted, by their own weight and force were fixed, until at last the Sands giving way, they were removed. Besides Counsel and Policy, Fortune also assisted the Nassavians, the Enemies Powder being blown up, wherewith they should have charged their Guns: And Victory being cryed out, though before the time, yet was a good Omen to foretell a true one. The Arch-Duke Albertus, while any hope remained, ri∣ding through the whole Army, was reported to advance with those of Diest, against the Enemy, with his Face uncovered, that so his example might be the more famed; in which action, 'tis said, that his Ear was struck by the top of a Ger∣mane Souldiers Lance: There was one who had laid hold of his Horse Bridle; but was immediately killed by the di∣ligent fidelity of those that guarded his Person. At length, doubting the Fortune of the Field, he departed out of the Battel: It is believed he might have been taken, if the Soul∣diers at Ostend had sallyed out upon them as they fled; or they which were sent to Leffingen-Bridge, had durst to have remained there; but part of them being such as escaped the mornings slaughter, being mindful of what was past, and dreading what might happen in the future, were timorous; but the Horse, whereupon the Arch-Duke rid, being eminent
for his Color, (but changed, for that he was tyred) became afterwards a Prey. The General being fled, they which till now had fought with equal Valour, betook themselves to their Heels, yield∣ing their Backs to be harryed by their Persuers, till by little and little all had left the Field, but Four Thousand Germans, who keeping their Orders, fairly Retreated with Honour: Nor did the Victors delay to follow their flying Enemies, as they were scatter'd over the Marishy and unpassable parts of the Country. But the Prince, after Thanks given to God, the greatest part of the Day being spent, he withdrew some choice Re∣giments and Troops from the Battel, to be a Safeguard and Reserve against any suddain Chances of War; which done, in the very place of the Fight, with the chief of the Captive Lords, he took his Supper and Repose that Night, as the sole Support of the Victory. All round about were scatter'd Arms, and dismembred Limbs, both the Hills and Valleys were cover'd with bloud, and the place a Receptacle of Dead Bodies: Some found fault, that while the Victory was yet warm, they did not pre∣sently prosecute the Reliques of the Enemy. But the Slaugh∣ter before received, the Souldiers being pinched with want, after so long a igh, and a great many of them wounded, the Multitude of Prisoners, the Darkness of the present Night, the uncertainty of the Ways through Ditches and Boggs, and the Forts and Castles lying in the Way, deterr'd that Resolution. However, there was great Honour gotten thereby; nor shall you easily find a famouser Action of ma∣ny years past. Some curious in Antiquity did observe, that almost Three Ages before, Albertus of Austria met Adel∣phus of Nassaw, and took from him both his Life and Go∣vernment; and now the same day, being the 2d of August, the Face of the same Families is changed.
There were slain in the very Battel near 3000 of the Ene∣mies, the greatest slaughter falling upon them of Diest, and where they fled, all the Ways, Fields, and Marishes, were strowed with their dead Bodies. There were almost 1000 kill'd in the Victorious Army, besides those lost with Er∣nestus; the greatest part of the English, whose Valour was most active, with 8 of their Captains, were slain in the Fight; the rest, all but two, were wounded: All the Artillery, and a∣bove one hundred Colours were taken, many Prisoners, of whom several were Noble-men. Mendosa himself, while yet the Battel was uncertain, when he was beaten from his Horse, and led aside as a Priso∣ner, Prince Maurice took great care for him, in commisera∣tion of the common Fortune, and remembrance of Affinity; for Henry of Nassaw, being of Old very powerful in Spain, marryed a Wife out of that Family. Sapena dyed of his Wounds, but giving infinite Applauses to Prince Maurice's Providence. The Noble Young-men, that belonged to the Arch-Duke's House, were presently, and without Ransome, set at Liberty: But the Legates of the States, who were in∣closed in Ostend, never passed any day with so much Care and Sollicitude; for they which came out of the Forts, de∣liver'd to Albertus, as also, they that fled from the slaughter in the Morning, brought with them into that Town very great Terrour: And after, when both Armies were in sight fighting, as Fortune inclined, either this way, or that way; so to them it seem'd that the Commonwealth reeled: Now fal∣ling to their Prayers, anon to the consideration of the For∣tune of War; and, as any one had been the Mover of more venturous Counsels, so he seem'd to be chiefly concern'd in the danger: But after the Event had freed them from their fear, and that early the next day, the Prince bimself came with his Prisoners, and all other Ensigns of Victory, then might you have seen the Joy of their Countenances, and su∣perabundant and festivous Gratulations. They had seen him
often Victorious, often deserving the highest Applauses; but more especially, famous was the Action of this Day, wherein the safety of so many men, and in them of their Country, and the Honours of so great a Triumph, they ac∣knowledged onely to be received from the Goodness of Al∣mighty God. But the Courtiers, who are a crafty sort of Men in sowing Discord, chiefly from this very time began, as envying the Great Mens. Authority, to object the Prince's Anger, and some Speeches of the Vulgar; as if they, being valiant enough among safe Counsels, had, for their own sakes, onely engaged so many Armed Men, and the Prince himself in so great Dangers. The three first days, after the Fight, were spent in deli∣berating concerning Things of greatest moment on both Sides, while the Prince advises part of his men to go and re∣ceive Oldenburg, that so a Passage might be opened into the very Heart of Flanders, and other parts, to return to the Siege of Newport. Now began the Weather to grow Turbulent, both with great Winds and Rain, which caused a procrasti∣nating Delay in the Transacting of many Affairs; besides, the Souldiers began to be refractory to Command, either grown timorous, by the Review of the great Dangers they had lately passed through, or else embolden'd by Victory; for they quarrel'd, and sometimes fought about the Prisoners, whom some, out of Respect to the Law of Arms, or that they might not lose their Ransome, endeavour'd to preserve: O∣thers, especially the Scots, offended for the loss of their Com∣panions, or pretending the like Wickedness from the Ene∣my in some Cases, without any Respect to their Officers commanding the contrary, openly slew them. But, in the in∣terim, Albertus having recollected his Courage to bear his Loss, re-inforcing with strong Garrison's Oldenburg, and other Forts thereabouts; and, not far off, at Bruges▪ prepar'd to raise a new Army, out of those that survived the Fight, or could be sent for from all parts of the Borders. Some also fled
to Newport, whither afterwards Prince Maurice came, but could not perfect his Siege, by reason of the unseasonableness of the Weather. At which time, first five hundred, then two thousand men, conducted by Barlotte, got into the Town; by which means, they were so well able to defend their Walls, that they could make frequent Sallies, and many times suc∣cessfully enough. Which Prince Maurice perceiving, the Twelfth Day after he came thither, he led away his Army, and, with like difficulty, attempted to besiege one of the Forts about Ostend, scituate among the Meadows, and call'd by the Name of Isabella. Hither also Claudius Barlotte came, and did his best and last Endeavour, being there slain with a Bullet, He was a Man of a noble Courage, a Lorrainer by Birth, and skill'd in the Art of Chyrurgery, by which he got his Living; but afterwards, by some unworthy Act, recon∣ciled to Count Mansfeldt, whose Wife he was said to have attempted: But arising to Honour, he so behaved himself, that he was esteem'd worthy of greater Honour every Day; by which means, his Death was much lamented by his Ge∣neral, and as much rejoyced at by those who envyed his new and upstart Rising. Prince Maurice being out of all hope of making War in Flanders, by reason of the difficulty of the places, and the recruited strength of the Enemy, at length hoysted Sayl to Ostend, carrying no other benefit with him of his hard-gained Victory, besides the Glory thereof: Before his departure, he commanded Fort Albertus to be demolish'd, but the Ene∣my quickly repaired it. And as the Fleet went away, the Weather, by chance, being Calm, Spinola's Ships ventur'd to set upon some straglers thereof, as they lagged behind: But the Winds on a suddain rising, they could scarce get safe away with all their Oars, the Fleet pursuing them, until they were hindred by the Shallows: Some Attempts of Count Lewis of Nassaw into Brabant, about this time, came to no∣thing:
The rest of the Year, being almost the half thereof, was spent in quiet, as if equally divided between these two great Enemies; the one, contenting himself in the happy Event of his successful Battel; the other, in the deserved Ho∣nour of saving Flanders from Ruine. While Flanders was thus involved in War, an Assembly of the States was summon'd at Bruxels, according to the old Custom, but of late omitted; being perswaded hereto, because they understood the Disposition of the Netherlan∣ders; and he was advised also, to put on a moderate Car∣riage, and to use perswasive Language; and, under pretence of asking Counsel, to require Money. [He said, he was very much grieved for the Evils, wherewith the People were op∣pressed, nor would he augment them by Dissimulation; And if any Remedy for the same could be obtained by Peace, he would be rea∣dy to further the same: But if the Enemies Obstinacy gain-said a Settlement, yet they should not despair, for that their Cause was better: For their Benefit, the Spanish Wealth was consumed, from whence had been drained, for many Moneths, to maintain their War, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Scutes Monthly: But that Discipline might be restored, the Souldiers employed with∣out injurious Actions, it was just, that the Netherlanders them∣selves should give their Assistance, that Pay might be raised for the Souldiers, and for discharge and maintainance of the Garri∣sons. And when the Revenues of the Prince's Patrimony was in the French Troubles laid to Pledge, they ought now to be given to him and his Princely Spouse, for the better Support of their Gran∣deur and Government.] While the rest of the Things were in Debate, the business of Money was laid aside; by which means, Mutinies and Seditions began every day more and more to spread; so that a new Design was laid between the Remains of those of Diest that escaped from the late Battel, and the Souldiers of Hamante.
But the Netherlandish States, by this occasion, interesting Themselves more nearly in the Common-wealths Affairs, fell to Inquiry, What was the Advantage they received from the Spanish Aids, and what was fit to supply the Garrisons, and maintain the War both at Sea and Land: But the main Thing they insisted upon was Peace. But the Hollanders suspected ma∣ny Things, and not without Reason; as, That all the Castles in the Netherlands, and the chief Offices, were in the Hands of Foreiners, contrary to the Laws; and that which is set down in those very Instruments made of late, by which the Netherlands were transferced to the Arch-Dukes: For there was a Necessity imposed upon Religion, the Indies shut up from them, and the Princes themselves obliged to the King of Spain as Pensioners and Clients; which things they found fault with, partly as grievous, partly as mischievous: But if King Philip would take away these things, and, by the Princes leave, it might be lawful for them to make a League with the Hollanders, that so there may the grea∣ter Credit be given to their Covenants, they hoped, in short time, to re-unite all the Provinces under one Government. The Arch-Duke consented, that Deputies should be sent, in the Name of the several States under his Command, to the United States, to try their Intentions: And to this pur∣pose came Gerard Horn, Count Bassigny, Philip Bentingen, and Henry Code, a Burgo-Master of Ipre, to Berghen op-Zme, after Newport Fight, at the same time when the United States Deputies went out of Flanders and were arrived there; They desired that a Meeting might be appointed in that place, that so they might Treat of the Means conducing to Con∣cord: Many Things were spoken on both Sides, in deresta∣tion of War, and in commendation of Peace, and for the ge∣neral safety of the Netherlands. On the behalf of the United States it was urged, That nothing could be more acceptable to them than to purge the Netherlands from Forein Slavery; for doing whereof, they promised their best Assistance; And if they would resume their Antient Liberty, there should be no difference
between them in point of Religion; but if they did not think, fit of this Proposition, they could not imagine what success they could hope from this Treaty; for what Peace could they expect from the Spaniards, who broke Peace with them that had no thoughts of War? But the Archdukes are bound to the Spaniard by Condi∣tions dishonourable to the repute and fame of the Netherlands. And the Brabanters, Flandrians, and other States are in like manner obliged to them; of what validity therefore will any Agreement be that is made with them, who live under Lords, commanded by Castles, and kept in awe by Souldiers, so that they are not Masters of themselves. The Archdukes people an∣swered, That they came to Treat of Peace, not to make a defecti∣on, nor would it be just that themselves should lay aside their Arms, while others keep armed; but whatever was agreed be∣tween the States, the Princes would ratify. These things being heard and spoken by the Arch-dukes people, and imagining that they must utterly throw away all hopes of Peace with the Hollander so late a Conquerour, fall to examine, the Charge of the War, and after a long debate what every Province should pay, because the old form ap∣pointed in the French Wars, by reason the Forces of the Pro∣vinces were altered, and Arms inferred on other places, could not be observed; at last they agreed to lay certain Taxes upon all Chimneyes and other things, and thereupon promised, thirty thousand Florens Monethly for the next year, but it continued for the future. That every of the Garrisons should pay their own Souldiers, and that no Citi∣zen should be compelled after that to give any Souldier a gratuity: That part of the Forces should be commanded, and part of the places governed by Netherlanders, and that the Treasury should be ordered by the States; part of which the Archduke denyed absolutely, other part he never per∣formed, though he gave hopes thereof by promise. Many also were much offended at certain Letters brought by Hen∣rico Gusman out of Spain, wherein the King called these
States, His. The same endeavoured to make an inquiry in the Merchants Accounts, if there had been any dealing with the Hollanders, (for this is usual in Spain) or if any money could be spared from the India Companies, but by the de∣nyal of Antwerp, this project came to nothing. The Dun∣kerkers raged no less against the Hollanders at Sea. And Albertus himself commanded, That the Hollanders should be debarred as well of their Fishing Trade, as their Traf∣fique and Merchandising otherwise, on purpose to drive them to penury, and consequently to sedition. And the Dunkerkers being exasperated with the punishment of many of their complices, added their own malicious fury to this command of the Archduke. And therefore they punished this simple sort of men (for such generally is the Religion of Fishermen, that they think it very unjust to repel force by force), sometimes by burning, other times boring hos in the bottoms of their boats, now by driving nails through se∣veral parts of the mens bodies, and so putting them to a long torment under both the sense and fear of death, and other∣wise infested the Sea with such cruelty, that sometimes the Ships of War that were to guard the Fishermen, were assailed and taken. But when the Hollanders brought out against them a considerable strength, divers of these Pirats were ta∣ken, and expiated their inhumane Villanies with their heads, and the rest were glad to retire into their old dens and lur∣king holes. Their Chieftain himself, named Wakeney, with some Ships escaped his pursuing Enemy through the Narrow Seas by Bulloin, and got to Biscay in Spain, and afterwards having committed several Pyracies upon the Coast of Bre∣taign in France, at length hated by the Spanyards, and the greatest part of his Seamen consumed with want, himself dy∣ed miserably. Against Spinola's Galleyes, that they might be able to fight them in any weather, at Dort was built a great Ship (such as the Hollanders had none before) and was
furnished both with Men and Guns: the first men put into it were hired with wages, afterwards Malefactors were con∣demned to row therein, because Christian piety would not suffer such as were Prisoners of War to be put to that sla∣very. And the device very happily succeeded, for that alone being put to Sea, made many of the Enemies fly, carrying only with it a smaller boat. And in a short time, so great was their confidence, that adding only a few Cockboats, and choosing a peculiar night, the Holland Galleyes silently row∣ed up the Schelde, between the Forts of Brabant and Flan∣ders, whence passing to the very walls of Antwerp, at first unawares they took a ship with three tyre of Guns, and seven lesser Vessels, and afterwards by force and slaughter of the Defendants, carryed them away. The City raised with the outery, and running to the Walls, looked upon their own loss, and to their high disgrace, suffered it to be carryed away unrevenged, for the Conquerors went away safe, and loaden with spoil, after they had founded a well known tune in praise of William Prince of Aurange, not without some affection of the Citizens, remembring former occurrences. Towards the end of this year, the Hollanders were filled with the hopes of a French War to be made by King Henry against the Duke of Savoy, who being allyed to the Spaniard, as having Children by his Sister to whom he was marryed, was believed would undertake nothing without his know∣ledg. The cause of the quarrel was the Marquisate of Sa∣luzza, which the Savoyard had taken from France while it languished under intestine troubles. And the Pope, who by the Peace of Verbin was appointed Arbiter in these and like cases, undertook the hearing of the business, but delay∣ed his Judgment, untill the Savoyard at the instance of the French King came personally to Paris, and having under∣hand bribed the chief Ministers of State, appeased him also with fair promises and obsequiousness; but the non-perfor∣mance
at the day appointed, made Henry proclaim War, and by force to assault several Cities and Castles of Savoy. In the mean time Fontaine (who had sometime ruled in the Nether∣lands, and then governed Millain) gathering very great Forces, wherewith all the people round about suspected the Spaniard would make War in Italy, because also from hence sometimes designs were laid against several Venetian Castles, otherwhile new plots were discovered upon some Cities of Low Germany. But a sudden peace put a stop to all the Al∣pine troubles, it being agreed. That for the Marquisate of Saluzza, the County of Breseia in the borders of Lions, in which is, the bridg of Roan, should he delivered to the French, adding an exception, That it should be lawful to the Spaniard to lead over the said Bridg his Forces, either into the Nether∣lands, or Burgundy. And now King Henry, that after Peace abroad, and dis∣sentions in Religion setled at home, and ordered by good Laws, he might establish his Kingdome in a right Heir, de∣sires that the Pope would suffer him to be Divorced from Margaret Valois, long since disaffected by him, having been of no good fame; and besides that, for many years barren: which was soon granted, and he Marryed to Mary the daughter of Francis late Prince of Etruria, a Lady of excel∣lent disposition, and which by her more mild temper should purge out of France all envy against the Name of Melices. And the same Prince confirmed a League of Amity with England by new Conditions, wherein was concluded, That the boldnese of Pyrats should be restrained by severe Judgments and Pledges.
The Tenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. IN this year one thousand six hundred and one, The Ar∣mies being recruited and augmented, did threaten grie∣vous and terrible things; for the great Captains lay as it were at watch, and fixed in expectancy of the manifestation of each others counsels. The whole Winter and Spring was spent in Stratagems and Foraging, before the restrained vio∣lence of War burst out with greater Force. And first of all a Souldier born in Brabant, urged by the perswasions of the Jesuits and hired with money, that under the pretence of bringing in several prisoners to Gertruydenbergh, he should open the Town to the Enemy, was apprehended before his design could take effect. Soon after some Mauritian Horse∣men, suddenly forcing a certain Castle in Limburg, brought thence a great prey, and many Prisoners. About the sme time one Captain Cloet was sent to take the Castle of Cra∣cow, which is in the Jurisdiction of Meurs, and together, with the City and Country by gift of the last Earl came to Prince Maurice, but had been held by gran from the Duke of Par∣ma to Salentine Count Isenborg, by the said Count until that time; the same Cloet took beyond Wachtendone three hun∣dred Horse, and some Foot: which being understood, one Dulquio Governour of Straten a Town hard by, marching out by the Archdukes command with above four hundred Foot, and a few Horse, in the darkness of the night, fell up∣on the Enemy ere they were aware of him. And now he
had taken about thirty, and killed some, before the rest awa∣ked with the noise could make themselves ready, but as he retreated through the narrow passages, Cloet going another way through the open fields, met him, who being inferiour to Cloet in Horse, the Village being seized, he was forced to surrender. Thus being Conqueror, and hastning about what he was sent, he found the trench of the Castle full of Ice, and not broken, as his spyes had brought him intelli∣gence, so that easily comming to the Gate, which he forced open with Gunpowder, he drove out the Garrison. Albertus hitherto had Covenanted with the Souldiers in Hamont, that leaving that more inferiour fear, they should have the Town and Castle of Waert, from whence both the Countreyes of Leige and Gulick were exposed to their plunder, whereat the neighbours were grievously troubled. But all their frequent Messages and Complaints were slight∣ly passed over, because it was known of old to be a kind of gain, under the pretence of sedition to maintain War at the charge of others. So also were the people of Cleves vexed with the Garrisons of Berck and Geldre, and the misery of that people who had deserved better, was increased, in that the Hollander assessed as much money upon them as had been withdrawn by others, saying, That it mattered not whether by force, or voluntarily, they increased the Enemies Wealth, since they could not defend themselves from it. And because they heard of a Fleet preparing in Spain, and that the Dukkers infe∣sted the Sea with more then ordinary boldness, a greater Navy of Ships was sent to Sea, yet for all that some Pyrats appeared still, who in the sight of Scheveling, (which is a Village upon the Sea-Coast of Holland near the Hague) they exposed their Captives, and received their Ransome. But soon after bing circumvented by some Fisherboats, wherein some Souldiers were put, they gave satisfaction for their au∣dacious attempt, by their usual and deserved punishment.
Some old Ships also were sent to Dunkirk Haven, where being full of stones, they were sunk, on purpose to choak it up: But as oft as the Sea ebbed, the wood being cut away with Axes by the Towns-men, at the flood by the violent beating of the Waves, the place was again cleared of all. And some Merchants Ships going into England, were taken and made Prize by Spinola's Galleys, the Ship of Warr which was to be their Convoy, after a long fight with the Enemy, a great number of whom was slain, by some fire thrown into it, utterly perished. The same also thought to have set upon Flushing, some within the Town being cor∣rupted to have set fire thereon: but one of the Conspirators falling by chance sick, and by the terrour of approaching death, repenting, and making confession thereof to his ghostly Father, the whole Plot was detected and punish∣ed. In the interim, new Mutinies and Seditions arose among Albertus his Men: And the Antwerpers pacified a Man of Warr that lay in the Schelde and made a Mutiny, by gi∣ving them part of their pay. And the Walloons, that kept the Forts about Ostend, raged even to the wounding and killing of their Officers, yet were largely indulged, because by the Hollanders Promises they were like to be dawn off from their Obedience; and being perswaded to go from their Garrison, they passed to Montz. After these things, the United States, setting an Asses∣ment upon all Chimneys, and being assisted with Souldiers out of England, and Moneys out of France, again fell in Debate upon another Expedition into Flanders; but for that, all the hopes of that Design lay in the speedy execution thereof, and therefore that it was necessary first to divert the Enemy to some other part, it was thought sit to make a shew of Warr in the furthermost Borders: To which purpose, Prince Maurice sending before some Souldiers under pre∣tence
of a Marriage between Count Lewis of Nassau, and Count Broakens Widow, himself came to Arnheym, and then making no delay, he speeded to Bercke with above a hundred Companies of Foot, and Thirty Troops of Horse, of which Place Jeronimo Lopez had the Government by the Arch-Duke's Commission: wherein were of Walloons, Ita∣lians, Germans, and Mariners, almost to the number of Three Thousand Men, sufficient Provisions, Six and Thirty great Guns, and the Works well augmented, over what they were, when Mendosa, assisted by the Plague, had taken the Town. And while Prince Maurice with his wonted Prudence fortified himself against Force from abroad, Lewis Bernardo Avila, not ignorant otherwise, but grown more ex∣pert by late practice at Bommell, raised a Work without the Trench, and comprehended therein a place for Pasture to feed Cattel, because Salt was wanting for the preserving and powdering of Flesh, besides, he spoyled his own Ships lest the Enemy should get them: But the Prince disposed the Fleet which he brought, partly in the Rhine as far as Colen, and part of them he kept near himself, The Island, which lay near the Town in the River, being strengthened with a mean Fort, yet quitted at the first battery, was strengthened with more Works, and joyned by Bridges to both Banks: Then appointing several Quatters or Lea∣guers, in every place where there was any likelihood of pas∣sage, pitched his Camp in three parts, one of which himself was resident in, being scituate in the higher places next the Town: The Charge of the superiour Bank he committed to Count Ernest of Nassau: And the middle Camp to Colonel Gistell: Commanding in two places Trenches to be made against the prominent Works without the Town, with strong Guards all about, because the Works were often hindred by Sallyes. The first of which was of about a Thousand or more Men, by the way that leads to Cassells, this brunt was
susteined and repelled by the French, whose Commander in Chief, Castilion, a young man, valitly fighting, brought back an honourable wound. And yet the besieged not ter∣rified herewith, made frequent Irruptions on the same side, and also in the way towards Santem, not without some loss, as they unwarily issued out, and presently beaten back to their next places of refuge. While these things were doings, News was brought, That Albertus had besieged Ostend, which drove the States into no small difficulty: for it was dishonourable to leave the undertaking they had begun; and on the other side to main∣tain Works against so strong a Garrison as was within the Town, and to keep the Passges in all the Marishes and fal∣lacious Fields, could not be done without great Forces. And besides, General Vere, whom they had appointed to the Government of Ostende, refused the Burden, unless he might have Twenty English Companies (which would be a great weakning of the Army) to go along with him, which was granted, and the Prince expecting Supplyes, continued his Design. In the Interim, the Besieged began to come to an allowance of Victualls, and they requested Relief both by Messengers and Signs: the Messngers were intercepted; but some hopes was given them by fires from the Town of Geldre: And it's true, the Arch-Duke had sent Count He∣remberge to raise the Siege, with no small Forces, and to this purpose were the Carriages of the Neighbourhood reteined: But this Resolve was altered, either because the Camp was impenetrable, by the ingenious art of the Gneral, or else because they would keep the Enemies Army there, that it might be the longer before they should come to Ostende: When the Mines were fitted, the Prince shewing his Army, and making a Battery as if he intended a Storm, allured out the besieged, whom the violence of the Gun-powder buried beneath, threw up into the Ayr in heaps: and some being
ready, entred the ruines and possessed the place, though the Enemy not long after valiantly assaulted them. In short, all the rest of the Works being by the like art or force taken, and part by fear deserted, they presently and directly by means of Galleries, got beyond the Trench under the very Bull-work of the Town, which the besieged fearing, and because they wanted Chyrurgions to dress many of their wounded men, they came to conditions, and that the soo∣ner, that they might article for the safety and honourable marching away as well of the Renegado's, whereof many were in the Town, as the rest: This accession was at first very acceptable to the people of Over-Issell, who presently refused to pay Tribute, which for fear of plunder they had hitherto done, the very Boors being commanded to go to Arms and run to their Colours. This Siege was begun in the middle of June, and finished towards the end of July, when at the same time Ostend had been begirt by the Ene∣my Five and Twenty dayes: But before the Prince would come from those parts with his whole Army, he reduced Moers, a Town, as we have said, given to him into his own power, the weak Garrison being ejected, which the Duke of Cleves had put therein, clayming the said dominion in Fee, as returning unto him by the death of the right Heir. But he was accused on the other hand, by Patronizing many Wickednesses, to have violated the Laws. Ostend, (whose Siege for many Ages will be famous, and which I shall Commemorate as a peculiar Warr) is a chosen Seat for Fisher-men, and scituate between Scluys and New∣port, but possessing a small tract of Land on the Sea-Coast of Flanders; yet begun to be strengthened with a Port and Palizadoes, so that at the very beginning of the Civil War, it became an habitation for Pyrats, who had filled all pla∣ces with great fear of them. And afterwards when the
States Wealth began to increase, by the Peace made at Gaunt, this Town joyn'd it self to the League, to which it hath con∣stantly adhered ever since: But soon after, the Duke of Par∣ma having taken Newport and Dunkirk, was disappointed here of the Terrible Siege he threatned; and afterwards La∣mot having gotten into the Town, but beat out again, not onely added to their Fame, but increased their Care of for∣tifying themselves, which was augmented, for that Scluys was lost, and nothing more remained on all the Coast of Flan∣ders besides Ostend. The Front of the Town looking towards the North, was washed by the open Sea: On the left hand, which is towards the East, runs the River Iperlede into the Sea, which makes the Port or Haven, which is such (as the rest of Flanders) not able to receive any Ships but at the Tide of Flood: Now they have, by great Labour, cut off the River, yet the Haven remains intire: The East part of the Town is full of Sand-Hills, and uneven; but of later time made much more even, least those Neighbouring Heighths should advantage the Enemy. Thus all things being removed, that might hinder or dam∣nifie them, and the Sea, of its own accord, making a great Estuary of an hundred Foot wide, in the Plain next to the Walls, whose deepness was daily increased, by the Recess of the Sands, which, at the coming in of the Tide, was a vast Lake; but, when the Water was at lowest, it exceeded two Pikes length in deepness, and being somewhat more Forda∣ble at the very Entrance, and beginning thereof: All the Ground that lyes backward towards the South, being full of Ditches is oveflowed by the Sea, which at the Tide of Flood covers the whole Surface of the Land for a Thousand Paces, and sometimes more: With so great strengths of Nature, were the Artificial Fortifications helped: Of old, indeed, there were Formless Heaps; but now, by At, were reduced
into as much perfection, as the Nature of the place would bear; which Refinement began, when Albertus, returning Conquerour from Calais, and Hulst threatned a Siege here, which had been deferred till this time. That which is call'd the Old Town, was now nothing, but a great Abyss of Wa∣ters, and empty Ground, looking towards the Sea; but with∣out the Line of Ostend, they had filled the Sea-shore with five convenient Forts: From hence began a Trench com∣passing the New Town, into which the Water could be let in or out at pleasure by Sluces: This place was divided with two Walls, the inner of which had Eight Bulwarks, to which the outer answer'd with as many: Where the Stream passed by, there was a more flight Work; but at the Back thereof a strong Rampire, and, as it were, a Threefold Line, with a New Trench intervening. This is the Circuit of the Towns, of about half an hours Journey: Beyond, were several distinct and separable Forts, and which, if Necessity requir'd, could be deserted without damage or prejudice to the Town: One compassed about with Palizadoes, beyond the Estuary, at the end of the right side; and others in the Fields, close to the backside of the Walls; or else not far divided from them, by the interposi∣tion of some Marshes and Lakes. The Flandrians growing weary of the Excursions of this Town whereby the whole Country was wasted; and finding by Experience, that the Charges of Seventeen Forts, where∣with Ostend was then inclosed, would be without end; that the Licentiousness of the Souldiers waxed more grievous, and almost equal to the damage received by the Enemy; and of late a new Mutiny bringing their Fidelity in question, urged the Arch-Duke, That he would no longer suffer this most excellent Province of all his Dominion to be made unprofitable by one small part thereof: Although there wanted not some Dis∣swaders, who, from the strong Fortifications about the Town,
and the Sea being always open to it, said, it would not be a Siege, but an unprofitable and long abode of the Army in one place. But Hope overcame all these Difficulties, which also was much advanced by the Flandrians Promises of large Sums of Money; and the Enemies Residence at Berck made the occasion seem more fit to be embraced, especially since new Forces were arrived both from Italy and Spain, under the several Commands of Collonel Trivultio, and Collonel Braccamonte. Therefore, the fifth day of July, Frederick Count Herem∣berg sate down on the right side of the Town, and soon after Jeronimo Montiregio on the Left, at first approaching very near; but the Cannon quickly commanded him to a greater distance. Charles Nott then had Charge of the Town, which was furnish'd with sufficient store of Victuals, and other Mate∣rials for War, besides One and Twenty Companies of Soul∣diers; to whom, upon the first notice of the Siege, was ad∣ded another Regiment, sent by Collonel Ucterebrook: And now the Garrison quickly began to shew their Valour, in their first Salley slaying divers Noble-men, among whom Montiregio, and above five hundred Common Souldiers. Af∣terwards, when Sir Francis Vere came into the Town, not singly as Governour, but as General, with his English Soul∣diers, whose Number was augmented by new Supplies lately come out of England, forthwith it was seen, that he took care, with strong Guards, to secure what ever was of any strength without the Town, and also to extend his Works further out; one of which, for all that being scarce finish'd, the Enemy took, notwithstanding it was defended by 40 men: But from the back-parts of the Town, the Besiegers being Repulsed, with his greatest Force came to the left side of the Town: In the places that were overflowed with Water, he raised a Battery by a new kind of means, the praise whereof is wholly
due to himself, though most of the other late Inventions were found out by the Devices and ingenuous Contrivances of Prince Maurice and the Hollanders; and it was this, They bound together Faggots Twenty Foot long, and little less in compass; wherein likewise were contained Planks and Boards, that they might the more firmly, by their Weight, prevail against the Waters; they were call'd Stuffing: These, by little and little, moved forward, and, by the strength and weight of Engines, pressed down into the Old Haven, soon took away the use thereof, that no Ships could come in that way: But out of the Estuary or Gollet, which we said flowed on another part, by digging a little on the Shore, a Channel was made, which presently emptied it self within the very Works, and afterwards became a better and more safe Ha∣ven. This way there came in and out oftentime a hundred Ves∣sels, to carry out wounded men, and to bring in Guns, Wood, Victuals, and whatever else was wanting, either to prevent the Injuries of the Weather, or the fear of Diseases: Nor could the Enemies, though from the higher Ground, prevail any thing against it, their Shot being aimed thither at such distance as made them uncertain; insomuch, that because of its freeness from danger, a great number of persons came thither onely out of a desire to see it, to wit; Of Forein Noble-men, the Duke of Holsatia, Brother to the King of Denmark; and, out of England, the Earl of Northumberland, who view'd, with admiration, the same place, famous for all the Politike Devices of War: Wherefore, the Enemy find∣ing the Terrour of his Cannon-Bullets to be of no force, left off shooting, and fell to throwing in Bags of Sands, and great Stones, to choke up the Gollet; but that Design also prov'd vain, the violence swiftness of the Waters being too preva∣lent.
Now when they saw they had no hope of keeping out all kinds of Relief, Collonel Catrick, who lay on the West part of the Town, making Approaches and Batteries with great Violence, assailed and shot at the Work on that side, of which there were three close together, which were named the Porcupine, Helmont, and Sand-hill, formerly part of the Old Town, but now a great heap of Sand in several little Risings; one whereof being more eminent then the rest, had on the Top thereof two small Forts, one joyning to another, besides other Works round about, that those weak parts of the Town, might, from thence, be the better defended. To this place were so many great Shot directed by the Enemy, that it seem'd wholly to be made of Iron, yet got they not any benefit thereby equal to that vast Expence; for what∣ever was beat down, was easily repaired, and as soon as they were killed or wounded, fresh men were sent into their pla∣ces: Among those killed here by the Enemies Shot, was young Castilion, the French Collonel, and Nephew to that fa∣mous Captain Coligny, from whose Vertue and Valour be no whit degenerated; General Vere himself was wounded, for the Care whereof he was forced to go out of the Town into Zeland, from whence, not long after, he returned safe and in health: Nor were the Besiegers free from like hazards, for within a few days Catrick and Bracamont, both Collonels, were kill'd. In the Town, that the Bullets and Granadoes might be the less feared, the Ground was every where thrown up into thick Heaps like to Walls; and to hinder the Enemies as∣saulting the Rampire towards the Sea was their chief Care, because by their Approaches, they give cause to fear the same; therefore, the Bank that was builded for keeping out the Sea, was with some hesitation and danger thrown down, and the Event proved successful against the Spaniards, whose Trenches, Huts, and Batteries, made of Osyers, were drown'd
at a great distance, when the Winds made the Waters grow boysterous and Raging, so that the Guards were forced to fly to the high Banks which they had raised thereabouts, for the bringing their Carriages. The Sea being thus let in, incompassed Ostend like an Island, which sometimes was a little offensive to the Town, but with Palizado's, Stones, and other Ingenuity of that Maritime People, the greatest force of the Waves was turn∣ed upon the Enemy. Four Moneths were spent, wherein the Besieged made successful Sallies, and the Besiegers many fruitless Attempts against the Walls: Some Souldiers also frequently running from one side to the other, and some prisoners taken fill'd both Parties full of vain Rumours: And within that time a Traytor was discover'd, who had promised the Enemy to blow up the Town Magazine of Gunpowder. The Arch-Duke Albertus himself, and Isabella, were many times Spe∣ctators of the slow progress of their Siege; both Officers and Souldiers, in the presence of their Princes, shewing great Alacrity, some binding together more of those long Fag∣gots and Planks, which they wrought into the Fashion of Globes; and rolling these whither they listed, consolidated Moory places, and added new Works to those before raised; others endeavour'd to connex and joyn together Works and Ways far distant each from other; and some began to dig a great Ditch, that all things might, with the more ease, be brought to them from Bruges. But the United States, having lost their Design of invading Flanders, after the taking of Berck, weary of such vast Disbursements, and chiefly minding Ostend, passed over the Summer, and much of Autumn, doing nothing at all: But when they saw the Siege was like to be protracted, and that they did not so much fear the Danger of Ostend, as the vast Charges they must needs be at in Defence of the same, they
proposed, either to make the Enemy draw off thence, or if he would stay there, to fall upon those parts of the Country that were unguarded. A long time it was disputed, in what place they might probably get the easiest Victory, and with the most Advan∣tage to them: At length, Shertogenbosh was Resolved on, which since its Defection from the League, had never been attempted by open War: Neither was there, at this time, any greater Garrison, than two Companies of Foot, and as many Troops of Horse, which were all Commanded by Anthony Grobbendone, the City being always very sollici∣tous, that they might not be ove powred by the Souldiery: 'Tis true, the City were of a generous Resolution, so were the Magistrates and Clergy, of whom there was no small Number very zealously affected: These, That their ac∣customed Religion, Altars, Images, and beloved Saints, might not be forsaken, or contemtuously violated. Those, Repeat∣ing the Heroicall Actions of their Ancestors, whose Valour had so often driven the Geldians from the Limits of Brabant: Ad∣ding thereto, their own present Example: For every Night they set out Lights, and took Order by Edict, that the Pri∣ces of Victuals should in no manner be inhanced, and that all kind of Deaths should be taken notice of by proper Marks, set forth at the door of the deceased. They Erected likewise a strong Redoubt, for the safeguard of the Fuchten Gate. On this side, Prince Maurice pitched his Tents; on the other, over against him, the Counts William and Ernest of Nassaw: On both sides the Way, lying through low Fields, made the Passage very easie, for Pioneers to come to the Town. This Conveniency, and the Cities being no otherwise Fortifyed, or re-inforced, than ordinarily it was, gave hope of short Work about it; when otherwise, the Moneth of
November, and approach of Winter, would have been enough to deter them from beginning such an Enterprise; besides, the number of the Besiegers, were not sufficient to environ the vast Content of that City, being onely 73 Companies of Foot, and about 30 Troops of Horse, Ostend requiring the best part of the Army. But they feared not any Sallies from the Enemy, who had enough to do to defend their own, being not used to such bu∣siness, and all the Plain round about being Marshy, was shut up with Forts: They found also a Way to make the next Ri∣vers and Brooks overflow their Banks, by making Damms therein, the more fully to drown the adjacent Parts: But this was not so well done, but that the Souldiers for all that twice broke into the Town: And, at the Request of the Braban∣ders, Frederick Count Heremberg, with some Foot, and a strong party of Horse, was sent thither by Albertus, a Rumor being first spread over all the parts near, and all things pre∣par'd, as if he intended to fortifie the Village of Hell∣mont; by which means, he sent into the Town at first almost Three Hundred, and soon after a Thousand Men, the Be∣siegers knowing nothing of it; and when they came to the knowledge thereof too late, they onely kill'd a few straglers in the Rear. Great was the Care and Diligence of the Ma∣gistrates and People in the Town to prevent fire, which they greatly fear'd from the Red hot Bullets shot into it; for they strowed the Floors with Sand, took away all Weapons from strangers, and kept in readiness all things that were fit to quench fire: And the more to encourage them, the Arch-Duke sent and promised, That what Damage soever they su∣steined in their private Estates, should be made good upon the Publike Account. In the interim, Prince Maurice hastned his Approaches, which being brought to the Trench under the Walls, there wanted onely Galleries, and the last Extre∣mities used towards Cities.
But the Frost cut off his hopes in the bud, being more early and sharp then was expected; for it had turned the Water in the Fields to Ice, the Rivers were frozen, so that Provision could not so easily be brought to them, although the Besiegers way to the Town, proved more facile; but so violent was the cold, that the Centinels were not able to en∣dure it: Whereupon, the seven and twentieth day, the Siege was raised, Prince Maurice grieving, and often wish∣ing, that the Weather would grow more mild; But Count Herembergs approach with his Forces, caused him to make the more hast; for the Count had taken to him the Souldiers, which after their departure from Diest, we mentioned before, to be translated to the Town of Wart; as also those that then were at Diest. Nor did the Prince so much fear them in his Camp which was very strongly fortified, as that they should make an incursion over the frozen Rivers into Hol∣land, which was then left unguarded, the Carriages, because they had no use of their Ships, as many as could be, were sent away before to Hesden, and the residue were set on fire: The Fortifications were all left standing, yielding an ample Testimony of an Expert General, and an Industrious Souldier. The rest of Autumn and Winter, was spent in light ex∣cursions, The Hollanders forraging that part beyond the Rhine, which is opposite to Colen, under pretence of what was due to the late deceased Count Moers, and on the other sides, some parts of Brabant, under their obedience, being wasted by the Arch-Dukes Command, because they refused to pay Tribute. The War yet continued about Ostend, with equall labour and toyl, both to the Besiegers, and Besieged, for the Win∣terly Sea, now shattered the Works of the Town, anon those of the Camp; besides, the great moysture both of the Ayr, and the Ground, bred infinite Diseases, whereof the English grew weary, as finding their daily decay, desiring leave of
General Vere, to return into their Country; by these means' the number of Defendants in the Town was so lessened, that of seven thousand, there scarce remained three, which was not unknown to the Arch-Duke, who when he saw the Gol∣let could not be choked up, either by sinking Ships therein, nor any other great heaps of Wood or Stones, and that his Work could not be forwarded that way, the Sea and poli∣cies of the Enemy pressing much upon him, he resolved to bring the matter to the decision of true Valour hand to hand. And first of all, for a tryal of his Forces, he commanded eight hundred chosen men by night, to assayl the Walls of the Town that lye towards the Sea-shore, which they vali∣antly put in execution, burning up the Palizadoes and con∣suming all things of defence towards the Sea for a great space. But the Tyde of Flood in a short time beginning, caused them to depart, leaving behind them not a few of their own number, which had been either killed or wounded before by the shot; yet they resolved, having received new Supplies into the Camp at once, with all their force to storm the Town on both sides, as well that part which looks back∣ward into the Fields, as that which abuts upon the Sea; as also the Porcupine and Sandhill, the Principal Forts in that part. Of which, General Vere having Intelligence by a Pri∣soner, and fearing the small number of his men, without any advise of his Officers, but led by his own single Judgement, very few knowing thereof, made a short Truce with the E∣nemy, and seeming, as if he intended a Surrender, both re∣ceived, and gave Pledges. But the Souldiers, especially they of Rossem, mutinying thereat, as fearing they should be betrayed to an implacable Enemy. Vere was forced to send back the Arch-Dukes Pledges, and to declare the Reasons of his actions to his Officers, which was this, That under pretence of a Treaty, he might spin out that time of danger, untill his expected Relief came; which being understood, it seemed
good to all, That for the safety of those Gentlemen, which were then Hostages with the Enemy, they should draw some eminent Persons among the Enemy into the Town, with whom they would Treat very slowly, upon some unusuall and unlikely Termes; among which, this was one, That the Arch-Duke should pay a great sum of Money to the Souldiers, upon their marching out of the Town. In this interim, a prosperous Gale brought out of Zeland, five Companies of Men into the Town, when immediately, General Vere declared both to the Arch-Duke, and his Com∣missioners, that he had been driven by necessity, to desire a Treaty; but now, in regard Supplies and Relief were come to him, he could proceed no further, without breach of his Oath; yet that he hoped, if he should in the future, be re∣duced to extremity, by the Arch-Dukes Forces, the Cle∣mency of so great a Prince, would vouchsafe to hear him. This Affront, (for so was it looked upon) highly enraged the Arch-Duke, because all Flanders were in a manner, come together, to see the delivery of the Town; yea, and the same of this Treaty, was flown into Foreign Kingdoms: Neither was this deceitful kind of Policy altogether excused by the States themselves, who looked upon it as dishonou∣rable in it self, and carrying with it more of danger, than necessary convenience. This year, some Foreign Affairs, brought no small disad∣vantage to the Dutch Affairs; for in England, the Earl of Essex, the great Adversary to the Peace of Spain, though he was not at first committed to Custody, yet was banished the Court, and He that of late was so great in the Princes fa∣vour, supported with many followers, and defended with Armies, now could not bear his life without Honour, with∣out Command, pondering in his Breast variety of Counsels, whether he should assault the Court by water, or threaten it with War at a distance, his Enemy prying into all his actions
by the Queens directions, whose mind was now much incen∣sed against him for former faults, without any regard to his Splendor of Body or Condition, was called to answer for his offences. He understanding his danger, followed onely that Counsel, which at the present was worst of all, being neither modest enough, or bold enough; for detaining at his House, the Lords that the Queen had sent to him: Himself with a small Party, hastning to London, and there endeavour∣ing to pervert the minds of the common people, he was pre∣vented by a publick Herald, that by the Queens Command, proclaimed him guilty of High Treason, unless he presently submitted, with which the People being striken into an amaze, fearing themselves, easily put off the care of another. Hereupon, the Gates are shut, his House Besieged, and him∣self now devoyd of Counsel, surrendred himself, and was carryed to prison by the Earl of Southhampton. Judges ac∣cording to the Custom of England, being Assigned for his Tryal, he was heard publickly, where he spoke much against his Enemies, especially against the Lord Cecill, whom among the rest, he branded with this Crime. That he promoted peace with the Spaniard, against whom he had revenged them, but never altered his Faith and Allegiance to the Queen. A great while, the expectation of all people, was held in suspence, whether the Queens Clemency, and old affections, would forgive him, or the greatness of his Crimes, his sus∣pected popularity, and powerful Enemies, would deprive him of all hopes of Pardon; at last, he was condemned, and privately beheaded, giving great Testimonies, both of Piety and penitence, at the eit of his greatness, his Death being attended with many of his friends and followers. The Report of a Fleet built in Spain, spread a great terrour abroad, part whereof was directed into the Hostile Coast of Africa, and beaten back with Tempests, the other part car∣ryed a great Relief of six thousand men, to the Irish Rebels, under the Command of Don John de Aquila, who setting
forth a proud Edict, boasted therein, that he came to deliver Ireland out of the Jaws of the Devil: he Landed in the Southern part of that Kingdom, near the Town of Kingsale, and vainly expecting great Forces of the Irish, was Besieged there by the Lord Mountjoy, who Governed that Province for the English. Tyrone, the Head of the Rebels, attempted to break through, leading a great Company of men after him, over the frozen Moors; but being beaten back with a great slaughter, he retired into his fastnesses, and lurking places. Then Aquila, upon Articles, surrendering the Town, and whatever else the Spaniards held in Ireland, was in English Ships, transported into Spain, with the Remains of his Soul∣diers. Not long after, followed an unfortunate Expedition of the Spaniards against Caesaria, a City of Barbary, (now vul∣garly, but corruptly called by an Arabian Name, Algiere) wherein they reaped no other fruit, than the vast expence of a great sum of money, Now also, the Hollanders began boldly to undertake long Navigations; for they passed the Streights of Magellan (so called from the first finder, Ferdinand Magellan) afterwards sailed through by Drake, and Cavendish, Englishmen; and now by a fourth, upon their fame, to wit Oliver Vander Nort of Roterdam: this Streight being made narrow, with long turnings and windings between the bounds of America, and the yet unknown World, he with much difficulty, went through ino the South Sea, and over against it, the Coast of Chili, of an unknown Magnitude; where also, he found some enerayes to the Spaniards, and thence by a reflex course, came to the Isle of Borneo. And so coming to the Cape of Good Hope, having sailed round about the Earth, he brought back no Wealth, but onely great Honour to his Country, and the names of places not heard of before at home; But other Ships endeavouring the same Voyage, having neither Men,
nor Victuals enough, part of them being cast upon those strange Coasts, were taken by the Spaniards, others by the Barbarians: And after they were taken, were ignominously tormented and murthered, which in the Salvages, was but ignorance; but in the Spaniards, perfect Barbarisme. At this time, while the Hollanders strove to make advan∣tage of all Reports against King Philip, they were puffed up with great hope, by a rumour that Don Sebastian, late King of Portugall, was alive, there being a man found, who had marks upon his Body, such as the same King had, and being taught many private particulars, by some crafty Portu∣gueses, deluded the credulity of the rest of that Nation, untill being delivered to the Spaniard, by the Duke of Etruria, he was condemned to the Galleys (having first been shewed to the People) there to expiate his impudence and subtlety of the worst sort, where he continued in slavery, until at last, he was thence redeemed by the Kingly hand, of a more gentle Death. The Eleventh BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. AT Ostend, the Besiegers hope was yet a great way off; but the Arch Duke being inraged at the late action of General Vere, he resolved to try if the valour of his men could perform any thing against hope; and thereupon, shooting with great impetuosity from a battery to that pur∣pose raised against the Town-works, upon that part where the old Town and the old Haven stood, and understanding
that there was a great breach made in the Works, the ninth of January in the Evening, at the ebbe of the Sea, he com∣manded the Town to be stormed on all parts; but especially on that part. Two hundred Souldiers under two Captains, were ordered point blank to fall upon Sand-Hill; as many more upon the left side of the Bulwark, and the like number upon the Curtain running before it. These were seconded by Durange, a Spanish Colonel, with four hundred men more, whose directions were to put Garrisons of Men into all pla∣ces, as soon as they were taken, and to that purpose, they were furnished with Victuals and Gunpowder, and what other things are necessary either for the new erecting, or repairing of Fortifications. Against the Porcupine, two hundred were appointed to the Storm, and near three hundred more to defend, and re∣inforce what was taken under Gambalotti, an Italian Com∣mander, and under Don Augustino de Mexia, four hundred men, with a strong Guard for such as should work in the de∣fences when taken: Afterwards, the whole Army being di∣vided into several Battalia's, that they might be ready to give assistance, when ever occasion should require: And Count Bucqury was sent to the East part of the Town: At Sandhill there was a cruel and bloody Fight, because General Vere having received Intelligence from a Fugitive of the Enemies intent, had brought thither chiefly, as well great Guns, as all other things fit to do damage to the Enemy, and every where kindled fires, that all the Assaylants actions might the more clearly be discerned. And now the Palisado's being cut down, the Scaling-Ladders were brought to the Works, where between the prevalency of the Spanish Pikes, and the English Swords, was a very hot Dispue; during which, Gen; Vere opening two Sluces, and the old Haven, over whose shallows the Enemy was to pass, he drowned all thereabouts for a great compass; by which means, not onely
the Gun-powder was spoiled, which every Souldier carryed for his own use, but many by force of the waters were car∣ryed away into the Sea, and there drowned; besides, the Seconds not coming on according to order, they who were in the first Assault, were compelled to retreat, wherein they met with a twofold Death, the one from their Enemies Weapons, the other from the force of the Waters. And Bucquoy, putting what he was commanded to do, in execu∣tion too late, performed less; for while he delayed the Tyde of Flood increased, whereby his way was precluded. The defences on the backside of the Town, and other slight Works, General Vere took no great thought for, while the Enemy made this Assault, knowing that some threatning offers might be made on purpose onely to divide the Defen∣dants; for it would be of small benefit to the Enemy, if he had them, in regard they could with case be retaken: which the event proved true. There lay scattered every where about the Rampires, Cur∣tens, and Trenches, the dead Bodies of Officers and Soul∣diers, some nearer, some at more distance, as every mans Valour, or care had put him forward, or kept him behind; and many were carryed into the Sea, as is before related. Upon account the Arch-Duke wanted near eight hundred men, for the taking up and burial of whose Bodies, a Truce was desired for four hours, and granted: In the Town were near forty killed, but more wounded, among whom was the Generals Brother, Sir Horace Vere, while he excellently performed the duty, both of a good Leader and Souldier. Among the Bodies of the Spaniards, was found a Woman, who had dissembled her Sex, both in courage and a military Habit, as if he should have accused Nature, for not making Her a Man. The unhappy success of this Storm, together with the im∣possibility of starving Ostend, and the terror of lying all Win∣ter in a wet Camp, moved many of the Commanders to per∣swade
Albertus, That he would leave off this unfortunate de∣sign in time, before he suffred greater damage. But he was so sollicitous of his own and the Kings honour, that he had ra∣ther obstinately persist in a tedious and difficult labour, then let the World know he was unable to Master one Town. Therefore raising a great Mount for battery in the Camp on the left hand, on the right by little and little he made a bank to prevent the influx of the Sea; and this was done by fixing in the ground pieces of Timber, with other pieces over∣thwart, whereupon great Faggots bound together were pla∣ced like Stacks of Wood, the planks lying sometimes divided or open, another time made close like floors, great heaps of Sands were thrown thereon, that so the greatness of the bulk being more compact and fim, might with the grea∣ter force stand against the Waters. Which Work proved of such strength, that i not only served as a Rampire for the Souldiers, but was a Mount from whence (Cannon being planted thereon) they daily shot against the besieged. Ne∣vertheless Ships daily came into the Town with relief, with∣out suffring any great damage or hurt. By this time there were come to Albertus the most ingenious Engineers from all parts of the World, who all aimed, even with emulation, to choke up the Gollet; and when in the night some fixed a Cable with great Vessels and Anchors under Water, from one Bank to the other; the Besieged likewise another night would with little difficulty cut away all that fixed the same. About this time one Pompey Targon invented a frame of Wood like a Castle, which being placed in Ships, would carry Great Guns, but upon tryal it quickly appeared too weak to bear the concussion of the Waves, and that the sands would yield to the weight that was underneath in the belly of the Foundation; by the same also were made a kind of Boats, by the joyning together of boards and bundles of smal∣ler Wood, which should altogether be carryed by the Tyde, but by the shot of the Hollanders Artillery, these were more
then once overthrown and destroyed. The besieged likewise made provision, That if the Enemy should hinder them of that entrance into the Town, which at present they enjoyed, to have a New Haven between the Gollet and the old Haven by the old Town: for the United States were mightily in∣flamed with a desire of Glory in defending that part of the Sea, making a Decree, as if they foresaw the Siege would continue a long time, that every six moneths the Garrison should be relieved and changed, and accordingly▪ General Vere was sent for out, and one Frederick Dorp made to suc∣ceed him, by whom the ruines of the Town were repaired, the Fortifications augmented, and money continually pro∣vided to pay for the pains and labour therein taken: When Albertus his Souldiers could not get their pay, which bred the seeds of mutinies and sedition, which is for the most part the Mother of disobedience; the very Government it self was full of fear, and hatred, the Horse being appointed to drive on the Foot upon dangerous enterprises, or force them back when they took themselves to flight, as if they had been bruits without the light of reason to direct them. More∣over their promised largess of the Flandrians fell infinitely short of the charge, and the Walloons, that they might do the less help, pretended a Peace treacherously with the French. The Brabanters had a just excuse from the sedition of the Souldiers that lay in Waert, who by the conspiracy of others, wanted not much of surprising the Castle of Antwerp, and the Town of Hulst; yet among these various crosses of Fortune, some hopes was given to the Archduke, that Bredah might be surprised. But Frederick Count Heremberg that was sent thither, mistaking the way, came not thither till the day∣light discovered him. And not long after some of Prince Maurice's Horse took Prisoner his Brother Adolphus. Till this time Don Francisco Mendosa, who had been ta∣ken Prisoner at Newport, had been kept in Holland, some∣times in a more strict, otherwhile in a more unrestrained
custody, and although Count Brukells Widow, and the De∣puties of Cleves required, That he might be punished for his grievous Offences, the acting whereof, he defended, partly as done by necessity, partly by command. And the States did not think it fit to proceed judicially against a Prisoner, guarded by the Laws of War. But because there was a dif∣ference made between the Ransome of Commanders and Private Souldiers; after long debate, it was agreed, That whosoever of the People belonging to the Ʋnited States were Pri∣soners, either in the Netherlands, Spain, the Indies, America, or elswhere under King Philips obedience, should all be set at li∣berty for Mendosa; and either the Kings respect to Mendo∣sa, or future Generals, so prevailed with him, that he agreed to the said Articles. And accordingly it was performed, for there returned from all parts of the World, both Mer∣chants and Marriners, whom the Enemies rage for hope of gain, or the Priests hatred for difference of Religion, had carryed and kept there, part of whom had their very joints eaten off with their Chains, and now with joy remembred the darkness and filth they were wont to endure, others grate∣fully acknowledging their deliverance from the bitter slave∣ry of the Galleyes under most cruel Tyrants. And this was a matter of great moment, to incite the common people a∣gainst the Spaniards, by a fresh memory of their old inju∣ries, and for winning their love to the Lords, whose clement and popular action was applauded with many exultations, be∣cause they esteemed the liberty of their Subjects before great sums of Money which they might have had. Thus the Agreements being in part performed, and Pledges being gi∣ven for the rest, Mendosa was set free, ever after giving a ve∣ry good Character of the Commonwealth of the Hollanders, which he now came to know by a near converse, and from thence forward, became a perswader of Peace, rather then War to both parties. And from these more certain Rules
for the ransoming of Prisoners were set down on both sides. All this Spring the United States did spend in raising a greater Army then ever they had before, their Minds and Resolutions being augmented with the memory of Newport Battel, and the new seditions of the Enemy, from whence they hoped, before the Souldiers expected out of Italy arri∣ved in the Netherlands, either to renew their Glory by the slaughter of the Enemies, or by a Land March through Bra∣bant into Flanders, to go to Ostend, and there raise the Siege. But Prince Maurice, unmoved with all this noise, resolutely affirmed, That it was safer to use wary and cautelous Counsells, then to run on in rash and adventurous attempts. But the Queen of England, and the King of France approved the Opinion of the States, perswading them to go on with greater Au∣thority, because they assisted them with men and money. Al∣so a great strength of Germane Horse was hired, and very well furnished, with other very great preparations: And in the Moneth of June, Publick Prayers being first made by command, though later then was necessary, the Expedition was begun, at the same time when the Italian Forces arrived at the Netherlandish borders. And Letters were sent into divers places, as Artois, Brabant, Flanders, and the Deputies of other parts. The United States wrote magnificent things concerning their Affairs and Assistance by Forreign Princes; they spoke also of the Souldiers sedition on the adverse party, and of the wasting and spoiling of Cities, what was too much truth, and what reward had they for all these miseries, but that which is the last and greatest of all miseries, Servitude? for it was not unknown, what the Spaniards formerly prepared, and that a false Pretence, or the bare Name of Archduke might no longer deceive any body, they should see in whose hand was the Government of the State, and the publick
Power of Peace and War. If they desired the Glory of their Ancestors, or the Liberty of their Posterity, they should then joyn with them, or at leastwise assist their strong endeavors by some moderate Levyes. Let the Archdukes go and seek more peaceable Kingdoms. That it was easy to drive out the few Spaniards that remained in Garrison in several Ca∣stles, and then they might put the State both Civil and Ec∣clesiastical, into what form they would, and that it would be no great pains and labour to attain to the chiefest felicities of Peace and Liberty: This was the effect of their Letters, which were quickly followed by Prince Maurice, who divi∣ded his Army into three parts, which he commanded to March three several wayes; the whole number whereof, was Five Thousand Horse, and Eighteen Thousand Foot, and almost Two Thousand Carriages; the middle Tertia was led by Count William of Nassaw, That on the right hand by General Vere, and the last by Count Ernest of Nassaw; yet at no greater distance, then that they could easily meet and joyn upon occasion, however thus divided, they could pro∣ceed with more ease and celerity. The whole rabble of Pe∣dees, and other inferiour people that attended the Army with Mills, Furnaces and other necessaries that were usually sent by Sea, now followed the Army by Land, with no small difficulty. Passing the Maes at Nimmeghen, from thence the Army marched through the Countrey of Leige, by the place where William Prince of Orange, Prince Maurice's Father, held his Camp with his Army, which was conquered by Famine, not the Duke of Alva's Arms; which mischief, because he would avoid, by terrible threats he compelled the neighbou∣ring Towns, which of their own accord were more inclina∣ble to the Spaniard, to bring in Provisions daily to the Army, and to sell it at a reasonable rate, and yet was scarcely Vi∣ctuals enough found, to give sufficient to so great Forces.
The fifteenth day the whole army sate down at Centron, a village in Leige, not far from Tielmont, where Mendosa then lay: for the Arch-duke hearing of this preparation of the States had sent him from Ostend with forces, having left there Don John de Rivez to guard the Camp and fortify it round about. They that lay at Waert, laying aside their sedition for a while, were persuaded to come to Mendosa, and increase the number of his forces, so that now he had five thousand foot and four thousand horse. Am∣brose Count Spinola was sent to joyn with these, with eight thousand Spaniards and Italians more, which he had new brought into the Country, in hope of winning honor, and to assist his brother's endeavours at Sea and the Spanish affairs at land, with this select band of men. For he covenanted with King Philip to be reimbursed his charges, and therefore at present he paid his men out of his own revenues; and although Mendosa had the chief command as General, yet he directed and comman∣ded his own men; and as he kept them from the want which the rest suffered, so he would not give a licentious liberty, but kept them in a strict discipline: by which means it came to pass, that no souldiers ever behaved themselves with more quietness and civility, yet seldome was there any severity used towards them. By which example it was evident, that the strength of military go∣vernment consisted in money. Prince Maurice lying near them, drew his souldiers out of the Camp, provoking and chalenging the Enemy to fight: But Mendosa kept his men within their trenches, either because he was un∣equal in strength, or else broken by his captivity, he yet feared his unlucky fortune, and having once received a great blow, for the future it made him only fight by delay. These by all means avoiding fight, and objecting to themselves the danger and terror of a battel, made the
Prince perceive that all these glorious and great begin∣nings would come to nothing; for it was not possible for them to goe into the inner parts of that Country with so great an army, through so many narrow passages, among all the Enemies towns, and where the Enemy himself was ready to attend them upon all occasions: wherefore he thought meet the sooner to make his retreat & get to the rivers, and the rather, because Victualls began to grow scarce, and the harvest was not yet come; yet that the year might not pass away ingloriously after such great designs and ostentations, turning his thoughts to things of less mo∣ment, he presently sate down before Grave, a town with∣in the territories of Cuick, hard by the Maes, reasonably well fortified, having therein a strong garrison & all other things for the enduring of a siege. Hither being come the eighth day after a tedious march through the parching heat of the Sun, the Prince pitched his Camp in three several parts, where many of the new souldiers unac∣customed to such toil and labour died. On the upper part of the river lay General Vere, on the lower himself, and on that part where the fields grow marshy towards Brabant Count William of Nassau. That done two bridges were built upon the river, one hundred and fif∣teen foot long, and whatever was within the Camp, as also on the other side towards Gelderland, was inclosed with one continued breast-work, before which were very deep and broad trenches, for the clearing whereof seve∣ral forts and sconces were erected that were well fur∣nished with Cannon. The great Bulwark which the Townsmen held beyond the river being deserted, as not tenable against so great force as was used about it, proved afterwards a great assistance to the besiegers. In the interim Mendosa, although the most active of his Colonels persuaded him to pursue forthwith the Enemy
marching away, and to intercept him in his designes, fearing not onely his fortune, but the blame of any miscarriage that should happen, and besides being needy as well of mony as of all things else almost, he had rather advise with the Arch-duke, in this notable juncture of time. But the Arch-duke returned no certain answer, onely ad∣monishing him to be carefull, left going too far with the army, the Hollanders should suddenly with their Fleet in∣vade Flanders. From which direction Mendosa fearing to recede, in all his motions depended upon the Enemies counsells: yet however, preparing in readiness at Roer∣mund what he thought necessary, at length he also pitched his Camp near the Maes below Grave and Prince Maurice. Many thought that he erred therein, for that he ought rather to have chosen the superior part of the country which is called Ravesteyn, by which means he might have forced all his provisions from the Hollanders, and likewise have kept the like from coming thence to the Prince, because he had lain in the Enemies country. But now his Camp being fixed, it was very dangerous to pass by the Hollanders leaguer, and too late to goe round about, because Prince Maurice being diligent about his work, had in many places made approches and galleries even to the Town-ditch, by the commoditie of the banks, which were placed on both sides the river to guard the same, and yielded a secure and easy way to the Pioneers. Neither had the Spaniards any hope now, but to break through the open places, which were very large, between the Prince's and Count William's Camps, and so to get into the Town. To this end ladders were prepared, together with shovells and mattocks, either for the more easy climbing up of works, or demolishing them, as occasion should present: these were conducted by Colonel Thomas Spine, being a thousand choice foot, which were followed
by many others. But the Guards and Sentinells being very diligent and watchfull, although they set forward in the night, together with the breaking of the day, among the tedious passages of the marishes, made their attempt, how daring soever, vain. Whereupon Mendosa, being ashamed that he was thus beaten off from his hopes of relieving the Town, withdrew both himself and his army, that they might not helplessely look on and see the City taken, privately departing to Venlo. At this time the States taking care for Berck, sent Count Ernest thither with supplies. But Antonio Gonzales, Governor of Grave, with whom were in garrison fifteen hundred men of se∣veral nations, having in the sight of their companions wearied the besiegers with frequent fallies, would not yet desist by many valorous experiments to protract the time to his advantage, although all hope of relief was utterly taken away. After a two months siege, when the English drew near to the sluces, which kept the water in the town-ditches, the Frisons also on another part bringing a gallery even into the trench, and some of the Princes Pioneers being ready to undermine the walls, after the losse almost of seven hundred men, the garrison was surrendred upon honourable conditions, the souldiers marching thence with their armes and baggage. This town of Grave at first belonged to the Province of Gel∣dre, but was afterwards annexed to Brabant, and taken as a pledge by Maximilian Count Buren, whose son-in-law William Prince of Aurange bought it, and though lost in war, by the peace made at Gaunt the Garrison of Ger∣mans being removed, had the same delivered to him. But about eighteen years before the Duke of Parma having gotten it by the carelesness or cowardice of the Gover∣nor, Prince Maurice now regained and took possession of this his Patrimonial inheritance, as he had done before
of Breda, Lingen and Moers, which he made subject not for his own advantage onely, but the good of the Com∣monwealth; by which means he obtained a great do∣minion about the Maes, with very great advantages. While these things were doing, some souldiers en∣raged because they had but very little or no pay, leaving Mendosa's army, betake themselves to Hamont. He, to prevent the increasing of their number by impunity, hastens thither a convenient strength; where having taken some great guns, he forced a few foot-souldiers to surrender themselves, but the horse got away, not to be moved with prayers or threats; and having in vain at∣tempted other places, at last they seize the Castle of Hoch∣straten by the consent of the Garrison, (this place is not far from Breda,) wherein a short time being much aug∣mented by a continual resort of old souldiers, who re∣quired their arrears, and new souldiers, that expected no other thing then a licentious freedome in villany, chusing themselves a Head, they elect a Senate and settle a Councel-house with divers laws, expressing therein more care and diligence then is usually found in the meetings and assemblies of setled Cities. They would not suffer any rapines or plunders to be committed, unless by publick order and for the common cause; and if any upon their own account durst doe otherwise, they were punished like thieves according to the laws and customes of other places. Wherewith the Arch-duke being highly displeased, and fearing the example because of his want, gathering together what mony he could possibly get together by any means, he persuaded those who yet remained in their obedience, to punish the others rebellious persidy, and to that end prepared to besiege them. They perceiving them∣selves not to be looked upon as mutineers, (which in those parts is no new thing) but as absolute enemies,
begin to tread unusual paths, desiring and obtaining from the Hollanders Victualls, Armes and Artillery. And this they did the more willingly, because these troubles of the Enemy were very advantagious, and to make these differ among themselves, to a great expense of their treasure, would secure them against the like evils. But this resolution of Albertus was soon altered upon the arrival of the news that Grave was taken, for that he be∣gan to be afraid of Prince Maurice's army: yet for all this he would not hearken to the Netherlandish States, who a∣bout that time being called together concerning the raising of tributes, persuaded him to appease and win the offended Souldiery with money: But the Spanish Noblemen and Commanders disliked thereof, averring it was more fit to take some new forces into pay, but to punish those Rebells with all severity. And so at last threatnings of actions being turned into words, an Edict was set forth, wherein all that were in Hochstraten, unless they came in and desired pardon by a certain day, were proscribed, and re∣wards promised to any that should kill them, their goods confiscated, all that furnished them with provision should be punished, and their wives and children banished: ad∣ding above all the rest of their crimes, that their Sedition had been the cause that Grave had not been relieved. But all this threatning served to little purpose, for so much were they contemned, that they published an answer filled with many souldierly taunts, objecting to Albertus his fear of a battel, and that Grave had been in vain looked after long before their recess; and finding fault that while the Army was ready to starve, he feasted and revelled at Court without any moderation of charge; and repeating on the other hand the praises of such Com∣manders as were courteous and affable to their souldiers. But what wonder could it be, if, after so many others,
they required what was due to them for their service, or fled to such assistences for recovery thereof, which though unseemly in themselves, yet were made just by the laws of a fatal necessity? Subjoyning at last, that they were and would be safe against the punishments of that cruel Edict, partly by their arms, and partly by their poverty. Octavio Frangipane, the Pope's Legate, endeavored to appease this Sedition: but they would hearken to no con∣dition, untill that ignominious Edict was revoked and made null. And now the greatest part of Autumn being past and Winter approching, Prince Maurice having dis∣missed his German horse, disposed the rest of his forces into Garrisons: the like did Albertus, whose Army was grown thin by frequent runnings away to the other party, and the Italian souldiers decay (being but fresh¦men) through the extremity of labour. Yet part of the Army was sent into the Camp before Ostend; so were Spinola's ships in part sent to those parts where either the Enemies forces or the mutineers designs were feared; and the citizens of Venlo, who had hitherto with pertinacy refused a garrison, now were persuaded to admit souldiers, because of the near-adjoyning danger of Grave. About this time Mendosa departed into Spain, where he was somewhat strangely received, King Philip the father being dead, and the son prepossessed by others, who accused him for his unfortunate managery of the war, and that he had neither sufficiently taken care for Peace, nor undertaken or avoided battells as the necessity or contingency of affairs required. Upon the forces departing into winter-quarters, it fortuned that fourteen troups of the Hollanders fell upon eight of Albertus his troups, that were without their
officers, lying somewhat carelessely not far from Me∣stricht, where they surprised and took most of the Horse in their beds, together with five Corners or Horse-colours, which were hanged up in the Palace at the Hague, and a great number of horses. At winter, when the seditious began to incroach upon other parts, Count Lewis of Nassau was sent with three and thirty troups of horse and twelve hundred foot, to wast all the farther parts of the enemies country that denied to pay contribution; where he took the town of S. Vt, and for a whole moneth together ranging all about, burning the Villages and spoiling the Country, he did no small damage to the Province of Lutzenburg. At this time also the Hollanders had very good success at Sea. Fredericks Spinola was coming out of Spain with eight new galleys; and Martin Padilia being made Admiral of the Sea was said to be preparing a great Fleet, which was suspected to threaten England or Ireland: whereupon the Queen sent forth some ships, to watch their actions and wait upon their motions, and, as occasion should offer it self, either sink or take them: and accordingly they burned two of Spinola's galleys, and utterly made them useless, at Sesymbra a town of Portugal, giving to the slaves therein their liberty, and to the rest their lives. But for the future to prevent the like damage, a great ship of Portugal, of the same sort with those they call Carracks, was opposed against them, laden with precious Merchandises, which while the English assaulted, and soon after took, the rest escaped by flight. And Frederick Spinola, being long detained in Spain, untill he could have his covenants with the King confirmed, with his six remaining galleys (where∣in were nine hundred souldiers and fifteen hundred slaves that rowed) in the moneth of October set forth towards Flanders: upon news whereof the Queen ordered three
Ships to wait upon the English coasts, and in the narrow Seas; to which the Hollanders joyned four of theirs, be∣sides those which guarded the coast of Flanders. The En∣glish first getting sight of these Galleys, gave notice to their Companions; but the Galleys making use of the clou∣diness and calmness of the weather, went so near the En∣glish shore, that some of the Slaves throwing off their chains leaped into the shallow waters: but the Hollan∣ders pursuing the vessels, sometimes by the shore, other times in the narrow Sea, not farre from Graveling with their great Guns sorely bruised two of them, and twice or thrice being pressed with the vast bulk of their own Ships, they were broken to pieces; the Masts, Oars, and residue of the Ships being torn in pieces floated upon the Sea, but their main bulks were swallowed up in the waves. Almost two hundred of the men were saved, and more of them might have been, but that mercy was ba∣nished by fear, lest the conquered should become more in number then the Conquerors. Besides, one other of them suffered Ship-wreck at Calais by the unskilfulness of the Pilots; two others of them were much shattered with bullets, and falling upon the shelves in that coast of Flan∣ders got into Newport; the sixth, wherein Spinola himself was, sailing up and down in the Sea of Zeland, at last not without great hazard, and throwing over-board much of their lading, the slaves being incouraged with hope of li∣berty, arrived at Dunkerk. When then Frederick Spinola had joyned these three with the rest which he had before at Scluys, aiming to repair both his credit and fortunes from the spoils of Walcheren, he was with-held by winterly and contrary blasts of wind, and because the Arch-duke, being vexed both with forein and intestine Warre, refu∣sed to denude his Garrisons for the refurnishing those Vessels.
At this time the Fame and Trade of the Hollanders in∣creased in the Indies, to the great detriment of the Por∣tugueses, who of old having been the first Finders, had now for one hundred years quietly enjoyed those Naviga∣tions, and out of reverence of the Pope's Donation made to them had extorted and kept the same from the beginning against both the Castilians and other Christian Nations, defending themselves therein by force of Arms. These therefore make address to King Philip, as the onely co∣lumn and support of that flourishing Kingdome, that he would with an extraordinary Fleet defend those revenues which belonged as well to himself as to the People. From hence it came to pass that the Warre, which had hitherto been contained within the Netherlands, was now passing into another World; for the managing and conduct where∣of Don Andrew Hurtado Mendosa was chosen, who then by chance had beaten Cunala, an Indian Pirat about Ma∣labar, having used those parts above fifty years, and was now with great applause ennobled with a Royal Commis∣sion. This man being furnished with divers great Ga∣leons and lesser Ships, to the number of twenty and up∣wards, wherein were eight hundred Portugal Souldiers, be∣sides a great number ot above fifteen hundred Indians, he resolved to make exemplary according to his Commission all such, whether Kings or Subjects, that had admitted the Hollanders to trade freely, and Bantam a City of Java was the first destin'd to this destruction. It fortuned by chance, that at the same time, being the beginning of the year, five Holland Ships under the command of Wolfard Herman were in those parts trading: they carried about three hundred men, and were upon that account far unable to meet with the Portugal Fleet, whose Admiral alone ex∣ceeded the whole Dutch Fleet both in largeness of bulk and number of men: yet the fear of losing the Trade for
the future, and the hopes of getting honour and favour a∣mong those Eastern people, drew them not onely to fight like men hand to hand, but to undertake the Combat with their great Guns, wherewith the Hollanders being very well accommodated did their Enemies very great mischief, because being onely driven by the winde, and able to re∣treat & draw off as they listed, by their quickness of motion they frustrated all the intended violence of the Portugue∣ses. Thus they fought for some daies even without inter∣mission, until some of the Enemies Ships being sunk, and two of them taken, the Spaniard daunted with the novelty of such an unexpected mischief departed, steering towards Amboyna, where without danger, there being none to re∣sist, they wasted the Town Iton, and whatever place else adhered to the Hollanders, with fire and sword, and the cutting down of several odoriferous plants. But the Con∣querors in the City of Bantam, which they had rescued from so imminent a danger, after a festivous reception there, soon after went to Banda, whence come the best Nutmegs, and undertaking the defence of that Island, made a league with the People, (for they have no setled Government) That they should not sell their spices to any other people; That they should not be injurious one to another concerning Religion, but should leave the judge∣ment thereof wholly to God; That every one of them should use their own Laws, but neither of them should re∣ceive any fugitives from the other. According to this form, in progress of time, they contracted friendship and society with other Kings and People that stood in fear of the Spanish tyranny. The chief of all the Cities of Suma∣tra is Achem, the King of which place the Portugueses, four years before, that were most potent in the Court, by bribes, gifts, and false accusations of the Hollanders, had drawn, partly that he would kill all such of them in their
Ships as under the shew of friendship admitted them into them, and partly that he would dispatch all such as should come into the City: and according to this design, a great many were slaughtered, the Ships that lay in the harbour knowing nothing thereof; moreover, the drink of that Country so consternated their minds that they seemed mad; nay, so farre did the treachery proceed, that the Ships were hardly preserved. But the King shortly after repenting the cruelty of the fact, the Hollanders which af∣terwards came thither making certain covenants concer∣ning the sale of spices, discovercd again that the Portu∣gueses had been buying the King's faith from them; where∣upon, when they found the Agreements they had made would not be observed, the Arabian Ships being gone out of the Harbour, in revenge of the injuries received from the Indians, they sent ashore some Forces; which thing be∣ing dissonant to the Laws of those Nations, afterwards gave the Enemies matter wherewith to recriminate the Hollan∣ders. But the Zelanders afterward returning, when the King was somewhat estranged from the Portugueses, they cleared themselves from that objected crime, and besee∣ched the King that he would send some of his people with them, that they might see they were not a company of Pi∣rats, (as they were aspersed among such as knew them not) but that they were a people famous for wealth and fidelity, having no enmity or warre with any besides the Spaniards. This advice pleased the King, that for the fu∣ture he might be more certain whether he might with more safety incline to the Spaniard or Hollander. In this voyage near the Isle of S. Helena these Zelanders espying a great Portugal Carrack, loaded with Pearl and other precious commodities, and putting themselves between it and the shore, after a hot conflict they forced it to surren∣der itself, being first much battered with the great Guns.
The men that were in it they set ashore upon the coast of Brasile. The chief of the Embassadours from Sumatra (whose name was Abdutzamar) died in Zeland, and was buried with a very decent funeral, having a Monument exquisitely raised to his memory. The rest that survived went to salute Prince Maurice then encamped at the siege of Grave, giving him Presents from their King. When they saw the great number of the Horse and Foot, and the Works of that bulk as was not onely unknown to the Bar∣barians, but such as exceeded those generally in use among us, they were even amazed with admiration. The Treaty held with them was by the name of Arabians: And the report of these things coming as it were into another World, made them not onely shake off all vain suspicions, but was prevalent with many rather to entertain the Hollanders friendship, then to be kept in subjection to the Spanish tyranny. The King of Ternate (which is one of the Molucca's) publickly owned the Hollanders, for at his request Necken invaded the Portugueses in the next Island named Tidoris. But when he was about to assault those in the Castle being ready to make defence, some darts and shot being spent on both sides, being lamed by the loss of his hand, and having lost some few of his men, he put off the fight. In Patau also and the coasts of Cauchin-China and elsewhere, their coming was very acceptable: but in Ceilon, one of the bigger Islands, where grows the best Cinnamon, they found the King (who is called Fimala) a great enemy to the Portugueses, by whom he had for∣merly been taken and carried away; and Spilberg infor∣ming them of the Dutch affairs, perceived them very de∣sirous both of friendship and society. The King of Jora also (this is a Kingdome in the region of Malacca) daring to rip up old injuries against the Portugueses, incited Jacob Hemskerk, then having with him two Holland Ships, to set
upon a Carrack of an immense magnitude that lay in the Streights between Malacca a Portugal colony and Suma∣tra; which he accordingly did, the said King being both the author and witness of the Victory. The Hollanders contented with the booty, which was very great, spared the lives of all the persons in it, (being near seven hun∣dred of all sexes and ages) although there yet appeared many fresh examples of the Portugal cruelty. That Ship came from Macao, a Town in the Empire of China which the Portugals possess by the courtesie of the Natives, whi∣ther of late some Hollanders being driven, they were by the Portugueses hanged and put to death, the Magistrates of the Chinois being persuaded that they were no other then thieves and robbers. Now Macao stands upon the River Canto, by which onely strangers are admitted a passage into the Empire of China; as to goe out of the same Empire into forein parts, there is no way but by Cinceo, a Port in another part of the Country. Thus wealth being gotten from the publick Enemy, and great damage done both to the King and Portugueses, great ad∣vantage was gotten with honour by the Hollanders both in private and publick: yet some were found in this in∣dustrious and gain-seeking Nation, who would refuse part thereof as not convenient or fitting, being by force of Warre taken from Merchants, and, as it many times hap∣pens such as least deserve it. And the pretence that mo∣ved some to this conscienciousness was the ancient amity with the Portugal, believed to be begun four Ages before, when the Netherlanders going to Syria to the Holy War, conquered Lisbone, then the Kingly seat of the Saracens. From thence great priviledges were granted to the Ne∣therlanders in Portugal, and no less to the Portugueses in the Netherlands. Besides, after the beginning of the Warre in the Low-Countries, and the Conquest of Por∣tugal
by King Philip, the Portugueses were invited by the States, that as they were equally subject with them, so they should equally enjoy all manner of commerce, and the same benefit with all their Citizens. In answer of which desire, not a few of them, out of hatred to the Casti∣lians, of old their neighbours, now their Lords, or lest the power of the Inquisition should grow high under pretence of Jewish or Arabian Superstition, came to the Hollanders: but they that remained under the King of Spain's obedi∣ence, and increased his wealth with their own, were by all Law accounted as Enemies, (especially after so many injuries among the Indians) as without doubt they might be. And that no man might pretend ignorance thereof, the States by a publick Edict declared the same. And here a doubt arising, whether the goods of Italians in those Ships that were taken should be esteemed Prize, the matter was decided by setling a moderation between equity and the practice of Warre. Hitherto many Companies of Merchants frequented the Indies, whose emulations since they enhanced the price of Commodities there, and here on the Contrary brought them low, and being several were not able by all their strength and endeavours to resist the Spaniards; the States taking this into serious consideration, of many se∣parate Bodies made one conjunct Society, appointing Con∣suls and Factors in divers Cities, that should sometimes meet together by their Deputies, and publishing a Law, that no one separately, during the space of twenty years, should sail beyond the Cape of good Hope, or goe to the Streights of Magellan. And now a day was set within which all should give in their names that would be par∣takers both in the charge and revenue of that Company, so that at the end of ten years new names should be re∣ceived and offers made. At this time there was collected
threescore hundred thousand pounds: And from this time, a new Warre as it were arising in the East, the In∣dian Company began to be esteemed a great part of the Commonwealth, for that not onely a part of all booty came to the publick Treasury, but also the common Ene∣my was exhausted at the charge of private Citizens, that daily made spoil of him, and made him be at infinite expen∣ces in his defence. But now the long wants of King Phi∣lip were at last in part supplied by the arrival of the A∣merican Fleet towards the end of this year; when also his animosities against the French, as if they had not before been violent enough, broke out more clearly, Letters be∣ing dispersed over Brabant, accusing the Marriage of the King with Medices as unlawful during the life of Marga∣ret of Valois, and that the issue arising there-from was illegitimate, and so passionately reproving the King's lust. About this time also was convicted of Treason Gonthalde Duke de Biron, (King Henry then warring about the Alps;) he having married the Duke of Savoy's Daughter, and co∣venanted with the Spaniard to have Burgundy in Dowry, to the hazard of the ruine of the King and his children. Being cited to the Court, when he denied his fact to the King, who till then was inclinable to pardon him, this was the first thing that aggravated the King's anger, although he well knew Biron had with his own bloud secured both the publick and his reign. This great Duke was of an immense spirit, ambitious of honour beyond hopes of satisfaction; but in the arts of Warre and his merits to∣wards his Country giving place to no French-man that ever went before him, until he dishonoured the glory of his Mareschals staff by his unhappy exit. And thus with∣in two years Ambition brought to a miserable end two men, that under their Sovereigns of England and France
were great Princes. But as Essex's attempts were more excusable, so was his death more serene and quiet: But Biron having conceived a Treason in his minde, was so farre followed by Divine revenge, that he contamina∣ted his end with a mixture both of impiety and madness. Now also the people of Embden began to blow up the coals of new Commotions, upon this occasion. Enno the son of Edsard succeeded his Father in his Transa∣masian Principality, and being pressed with the com∣plaints of all the States, supposing that he might more safely act apart, he had easily wrought upon his Nobili∣ty, that they would follow the Prince with all equal freedome against the Subjects. With the City of Emb∣den a Peace was made almost agreeable to the Delph∣zilian conditions, onely some obscure things fraudulent∣ly contrived were implied. These being drawn to his Party, contemning the lesser Towns and the Country, he laid upon them a grievous Tax: But the Town of Nor∣dam resisting his commands, he ran to Arms, and was not content to set upon them a mulct onely, but pub∣lickly erecting Gibbets, made Citizens pass under the yoke. Whereupon, calling to minde old feuds with the Embdeners, he terrified other places by the example of Nordam. He tears from the Magistrates the most active and ingenious of the Vulgar, promising that when the Hollanders were excluded, he would transferre the Spa∣nish Trade to them; and it was true, that they were friendly received that brought Enno's Letters. This was very terrible to the United States, and so much the more, because Christopher the brother of Enno was in pay under Albertus; and John, another of his brethren, being by the Pope married to Enno's daughter, to whom he was Uncle, advanced the Romane Religion in Pader∣born. And on every side it evidently appeared that the
Count laboured that he might open that large mouth of the Eems to the Spanish Ships. But at first the Hollan∣ders strength being imployed elsewhere, onely four Companies were sent to assist Embden, which entred the City at the same time when Enno drawing near with his Forces hoped to have been admitted by those of his Fa∣ction; but now being kept out thence, he entreth the Villages round about, and erects several Forts for the shutting up of the City and the River. The States be∣ing informed thereof, and now after the taking of Grave having some leisure to consult about their neigh∣bours affairs, at the request of the City, sent Warner Du∣bois, a Colonel of Horse, thither with some Troups of Horse, and almost nineteen Companies of Foot. He within a few daies assaults and wins all the Forts, and sets free the City from those rude and ignorant main∣tainers of Warre. Eno, that he might remove this dis∣grace out of his sight, with as much envy and bitterness of language as he could invent, disputed the Hollanders incroachments upon the rights of anothers dominion: of which the States being conscious, they published in Print the cause of that action of theirs, and the danger that was like to have fallen not onely upon themselves, but all Germany, by the Count's deeds.
The Twelfth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1603.THE Hollanders being oppressed with the French Peace, were attended with a greater evil, which was the death of Queen Elizabeth about this time, whereby they were more deeply plunged in a Warre, yet had lost that assistence which, as it was the first, so had it continued unto the last. She died the third day of April, being by the length of daies arrived to the toils of life, from whence she supposed her old age, which she had spun out even to the seventieth year, now grew contemptible, and that the hopes and counsels of those in whom she had put her greatest confidence were turned towards her successor. It was a long reign for a Woman, and famous not onely at home but abroad, which produced many various censures; some conjectu∣ring at the future according as they were led by fear or hope; others, from the memory of former actions, reckoning what prosperity and adversity she had seen during her long life. Here was remembred the behea∣ding of her Mother, and that for no small fault, but onely the supposed crime of Adultery; whence arose those many bitter taunts of her Enemies, as if she had been the Issue of an unknown Father. Soon after, when her Sister fate in the Throne, she was cast into Prison, Which was no small affliction of so great a spirit, until by the means and intercessions of Philip King of Spain, to whom she owed her Liberty, if not her Life, she
was freed from thence; though afterwards she requited his kindness with a long and sharp Warre. Besides, her Reign was accounted cruel by the execution of so many Noblemen, for no other pretence but that they professed the Romane Catholick Religion; and also in that no less novel then odious example to all Princes, though in∣deed excusable enough from the necessity, that by the command of a Woman, not onely a Woman but a Kins∣woman, and she a Suppliant, not as a common person but a distressed Queen, was put to death. Also there were some that stuck not to exprobrate the divulsions of Ire∣land, and seditions of the English Souldiers in the Low-Countries, as if they had been commanded. Certainly, it was the greatest of her misery, that she lived so long without a Husband, from whence came the incertainty of her Heir: and very various were the several opini∣ons concerning her; many objecting her love to the Earl of Leicester, and after him her endearments of Essex, whose hot and over-hasty youth, together with his con∣tempt of her decaying and aged beauty, was punished with the loss of his head; though soon after her minde was more changed from hatred to repentance, then be∣fore it had been from love to hatred, so that it was by many judged to be the main cause of her sickness and death. On the other side it was said, that the long con∣tinuance of her Government and life manifested the same to be well-pleasing to God, and that instead of the customary evils of youth, she had shewed great prudence in her carriage and behaviour in the enjoyment of both good and bad fortune. Nor was it so great a wonder that her security was established by the death of some Rebels and by Warres, as that a Woman's Government after four and fourty years had not onely made England safe, but flourishing; nor had she at any time taken
Arms but for most just causes. Religion was by her reformed to the example of King Edward, not by force, or according to her own fancy, but upon debate of the matter in the great Council of the Kingdome, and in a lawful manner. Nor did she rage with cruelty against those that were of another judgement, unless it were when it was too late, when by the doctrine and instru∣ction of the Jesuites they had thrown off all reverence & love to their Country and Government at once. By her help Scotland was vindicated from the French, the Prince of Conde's Party from their adverse faction, and much of the Netherlands from the Spaniards. And although she had so many great allurements to increase her Do∣minion, yet she remained content with her own, not de∣siring from all her victorious atchievements any other thing then the liberty of that Religion by her promoted, and to set limits to power that was or might be defer∣vedly suspected. Thus did she restore the Towns which she possessed in France, preserved Scotland for a Child, and rejected the desires of the Hollanders, intreating her to take the Dominion over them. And now lately the old Garrisons in Ireland being taken, and new ones for∣tified, some of the Nobles being taken here, some there, their faction was so infeebled, and the very strength and pretence thereof so weakned, and Tyrone himself so broken, that falling upon his knees before the Lord Lieutenant he humbly requested pardon of all his offen∣ces. (For that excess of Honour happened to him a little before his fall.) She had been courted to Marriage not by the English onely, but by Charles of Austria, brother of the Emperour, and by Henry and Francis brothers to the King of France; as also by some Kings themselves, to wit, Philip of Spain, and Ericus of Sweden. That she was thus sought was her happiness, but that she refu∣sed
all was her prudence; because as it was unfit for her Greatness to marry a Subject, so the Subjects of Eng∣land were afraid she should marry a Foreiner. The re∣proches that were spred concerning her took their be∣ginning from her sex and the elegancy of her beauty, together with the customary liberty of Princes, and could onely be refuted by manlike care and diligence. Nor was she onely well skilled in the arts of Govern∣ment, but was learned in the ancient and modern lan∣guages; an excellency rarely found in Women of a pri∣vate fortune: which made her Name and renown great and famous, and not onely terrible to and admired by her neighbours, but courted by Embassadours even from the Moors and Sarmatians. No man hitherto doubted, but that great Commotions would have arisen in England upon the death of the Queen, who had ne∣ver declared any certain Successor; for it was believed that although James King of Scotland was the next in bloud, yet the ancient hatred of the inhabitants, and the private fear of those that had consented to his Mo∣ther's death, would be an obstacle to him, there being se∣veral ready in England who boasted themselves to be descended of Royal bloud. Then also the power of the English Catholicks was feared, lest they should hope for that by Troubles which they could never expect while the setled Authority of the Queen remained; the Pope also instigating them, as unwilling that a King of the new Religion should be admitted, although he were next in bloud. Nor was that hope onely grown in the Spaniards, who lay at watch for the peoples commotions, but the Hollanders also, although they had by many good offi∣ces before-hand pre-engaged King James, upon the con∣nexion of Religion, yet by tacite wishes did guess that the imputation of their alliance with him would trans∣ferre
part of the Warre into Britain. But it happened beyond hope and expectation, that presently after the decease of Queen Elizabeth, the old Councel of the Queen, and as many of the Bishops and Magistrates of London as were at present at hand and in readiness, pro∣claimed King James, not waiting for the authority of a Parliament, for the danger of delay, and because Inter∣regnum's do many times in the future by new Laws and Covenants diminish the grandeur and power of Autho∣rity. Thus without any contradiction the King of Scot∣land got the possession of England, and was the first that within the known Records of any Annals enjoyed the whole Island of Great Britain in one entire and undivi∣ded Government. The United States did not omit forthwith to send an Embassy to congratulate him for his new access of mag∣nitude, having first sent some gratulatory Letters. The Embassadours sent by them to the King were Count Hen∣ry of Nassau, Prince Maurice's brother, then a Mem∣ber of the Councel of the States and General of the Horse; next to him was Walrave Brederode, thirdly John Olden Barneveldt, and lastly Jacob Valcken, who died before he returned from this Embassy. When they were admitted to audience, they spake in this man∣ner. We are come hither, Great King, divided in our selves between Grief And Joy: for we have lost Her, whose good∣ness and benefits to us we are not able to express in words; but we have found You, as the Heir of Her Kingdome, so the Imitator of Her Vertues. That which formerly we desired, and since that by publick supplications decreed to the most happy Messengers of Your new-begun Domi∣nion, that now in Your own presence with hearts and voices we beseech and begge of God, that this Your reign
may be happy and prosperous to Your Self, to Posterity, to Great Britain, and to Ʋs. We begge of You, Sacred Sir, one thing, That You would not suffer the insulting Spa∣niard to trample upon the necks of the Netherlanders, and from thence by degrees to incroach upon the Dominions of others his Neighbours. It suits with Your Religion, to save so many Assemblies of pious men from that King∣dome of sanguinary Superstition: it agrees with Your Justice, to defend a Cause allowed of by so many Kings: and it is an act becoming Your Prudence, to drive away those underminers of Kingdomes, and supporters of the Pa∣pacy, by whose judgement all that You now possess is given to them as a Prey. Your Predecessor Queen Elizabeth did this, and so we hope will You, and that with the greater ease, by how much You are in the prime of Your age, have a more man-like Authority, a more ample Power, and a House well setled upon the happy foundation of a hopeful Issue. Our fidelity shall in part supply Your Work and Charge, by whose prosperity and adversity it hath been made evident that the Spaniards could be con∣quered. 'Tis true, Peace is a most excellent Jewel, and worthy of high estimation among Christians; but that that is made with Tyrants and treacherous people is little better then Warre. If all they that are joyned in the Cause would unite their wealth, he would be deprived of the Netherlands: and if that punishment would not yet make him wise, he should be driven out of the Sea, and all his maritime Dominions, which would be no hard mat∣ter for the Hollanders and English to effect: and this cer∣tainly would make him glad to come to a true Peace, the best maintainer whereof was equality of Forces. Now is the siege of Ostend protracted unto the third year, so that having endured so long a misery, we humbly intreat You to aid us with supplies for relief thereof; for which pur∣pose
you may make use of those ships which by the Queen's command were furnished and instructed with Armes and provisions by us, being eleven in num∣ber, and now wait for nothing but your Royal com∣mand. Hereto the King very courteously answered as to the matter of friendship, but as to the rest he excused himself by the infancy of his Dominion, but in time he would see what was best to be done, in the interim not concealing, that as much as he could he would prefer all counsells tending to Peace: for hitherto he had had no difference with the Spaniard, and also Philip had voluntarily offered him his assistence, if any dispute should have arisen concerning his Kingdome; and himself being of a mild disposition and well grounded in all kind of Literature, had spent his time in studies rather inclinable to Peace then War: And the Arch∣duke being supposed to have made war with the Queen, not with the Realm, had by Edict forbidden any damage to be done to the English, sending home besides all Prisoners they had that were that Countrey-men; and soon after he sent Charles Prince of Arenberg Em∣bassador to the King, as also the Spaniard sent Don John Baptista Taxis to the same, for the promoting a Peace, concerning which the year following there was an agreement. When the Embassadors of Holland saw they could not prevent it, they endeavored to delay it, and to give the King some hopes that they likewise might obtain Peace together with their Liberty, if the King by procrasti∣nations or delay would suffer the Spanish counsells, which yet depended upon the event of a few years, to grow towards perfection. And this was the discovery of Olden Barneveldt, who was throughly versed in all the
secrets of the United Provinces, producing the Duke of Brunswick's hand, whom the Emperor Rudolphus had acquainted with that affair. But King James his hast was not at all slackened in making that Peace: whereupon the Hollanders onely contended, that if they could not obtain a shew of assistence, yet that they might not be denied right. These their desires were seconded by the French King, who was very sollicitous for the support of his allies, and to that end he had sent into England Maximilian de Rohan his chief Treasurer and a Privy∣counsellor. At last this Medium was found, That what∣ever moneys the French should lay out in behalf of the Hollanders, the third part thereof should be charged to the English, and all accounts to be discharged wherein France impoverished by her Warrs was indebted to Britain. The States were content herewith, although they were offered by Sir Ralph Winwood, the King of great Britain's Orator, to be comprehended in the Articles of the Treaty if they pleased; which they re∣fused with great thanks. The rest of the year King James spent in performing and receiving the Solem∣nities of the Kingdome, and in viewing his new Dominion of England, giving audience at Intervalls to the Embas∣sadors of other Kings and the gratulations of his own subjects; Tyrone himself, the great Captain of the Irish Rebells, coming, and upon his humble submission obtain∣ing pardon. Concerning Religion several complaints were offered by two sorts of people: The one in England are called Puritans, being a people that do not esteem the Eccle∣siastical State or Church-government there to be suffici∣ently orthodox and sincere, but requiring therein more purity, from whence sprung the original of that hated name of Separation. These find fault with many Cere∣monies
retained from custome and antiquity, as the Or∣ders of Bishops, some Ceremonies added (as they say) in the Sacrament of Baptisme, and others things more tending to Discipline then Doctrine: A change, or at least an amendment, of all which they now hoped from hence, because the Scots had already rejected the same. On the other side, the Catholicks with high applauses magnifying the antiquity of their Religion as well in Britain as elsewhere, and setting forth their fidelity both to the King himself at present, and heretofore to his Mother, petitioned, that if he would not give them pub∣lick allowance, which yet in France the King allowed to dissenters, that at least they might privately and without fear of punishment worship God according to the custome of their Fathers. But the King rejected both these suits, suspecting the Catholicks for no other cause, but that the Pope claims power over Kings: but the King was offended at the Puritans, because by men of the same Faction, under pretence of Ecclesiastical au∣thority, he had irreverently been used in Scotland. Whereupon also he accused their perverseness and obstinacy publickly set forth in Print: for he would have each Nation be free to use their own Rites which were not contradictory to the Divine Law, but the su∣preme Authority even in matters Ecclesiastical should continue in the King. Yet something was setled accor∣ding to the desire of the Catholicks, viz. That the Sacra∣ment of Baptisme should not be administred by women or private persons; that many Ecclesiastical promotions should not be accumulated upon one person; and that Church-censures should be strict and severe, both in the inquisition and punishment of errors either in the life or doctrine of the Priesthood. But the words of the Puri∣tans became so offensive, that many of their non-confor∣ming
Ministers were punished by Imprisonments, Banish∣ment and abjuration of the Realm. Notwithstanding which some of the Romanists, associating others with them who were desirous of novelty, conspired to set up to the Government the Lady Arabella, a Virgin sprung from the bloud Royal, dividing among themselves the chief places of honor and preferment through the King∣dome. The authors of this Treason were punished with the losse of their heads: the accessories thereto and such as had concealed the same were cast into prison, and the fear of imminent death was reckoned to them for a suffi∣cient punishment; the King being prone to win repute to his new Government by the fame of his Clemency. While these things were doing in England, Enno Count of Friesland beyond Eems, having really lear∣ned that he might easily obtain from the Emperor both words and threats against the City, but that he could not give him a power to put the same in execution, he resol∣ved to try the favour of them that were most potent a∣mong the Hollanders, and to that purpose he went to the Hague, urging many things both privately and publickly in his own defence, and objecting many things against the Embdoners, as being of a wavering temper in their fide∣lity, not well knowing either to govern or be governed. At the same time were present some Deputies from Embden, behaving themselves with much obstinacy and notable irreverence towards their Prince then present. At length after many long debates the United States, not doubting the fidelity of the City towards them, bent all their resolutions for the security thereof; and it was concluded, that the Delphzilian agreements should be observed: whereto besides were added, That for the future there be an Edict of Indemnity and Oblivion for all things already done, nor should the Count exact the
Penalties set by the Emperor's Decree: That both should be restored to their houses and lands, all prisoners be released, and all instruments of war and other received profits be accounted for: And that Enno should endea∣vor to set free all strangers, being really such, nor should deny his safe conduct in writing to all Ships going from the City: That the Tributes imposed upon the City the third and the fifth year before should all be made null, and that there should be a consultation had in the Senate of the Transamasians for the settlement of new; the right of summoning which should be in the Count, but if he neglected to doe it, then they might meet by them∣selves, and consult of their common affairs: That it should not be lawfull to denounce a War or levy soul∣diers without the decree of that Councel; onely the Count might retain as many as should be sufficient for the guarding his Castles and strong holds, and likewise that the City might raise seven hundred souldiers for the defence thereof and maintaining their works: That the Transamasians should maintain the souldiers, the charge of the works should be born by the Townsmen; and what goods were within a Town should be equally dis∣tributed, and whatever was inclosed within any fortifica∣tions should enjoy the same priviledges with the City it self: That the Magistrates of Embden should be crea∣ted by the Senate of the City, and that the Count to that creation should adde his authority. When therefore the Count and the Deputies of the City had agreed upon these conditions, it remained that the whole Magistracy of the City and the States of the Transamasians should allow of and ratify the same: which was very likely to have been done, the Nobility being afraid of War, as that which would wast their Lands, and some being sent by the United States to en∣force
force such as should offer to delay the same; the greatest part of the garrison also was withdrawn, that the fade of affairs might appear more peaceable. But new hopes from the Emperor changed Enno absolutely, insomuch that it was publickly said that those Covenants were of no force that should disannull the Emperor's Edict, par∣don Crimes, and grant a power of fortifying Towns, and all this without the Emperor's consent, whose authority in that City was supreme. And soon after Rudolphus, being not a little angry that the affairs of Embden should be transacted by a forein power, sent Maxi∣milian Count of Cocheine to the States, who grievously accusing the Embdeners, related the causes which had moved the Emperor long since to declare both to others, and to them the United States, that they should give no assistence to those Rebells; and that nevertheless they had invaded the City with their souldiers, begun a War in the Country, and taken booties: for the repressing and taking away of which injuries, the Emperor had sent his Commands by him. Which done, he recited particularly what things seemed unjust in that last A∣greement. To these things the United States, although they were more proudly reproved, yet returned this modest answer. That Enno came of his own accord to them, and had voluntarily entred into those Covenants: and that it is not usual to blame those that had used their en∣deavors in the composing their neighbors differences: Also that they had as little as possibly they could receded from the Delphzilian Covenants, which they understood plea∣sed the Emperor: and that they had sent their souldiers into the City, not to offer an injury to the Emperor, but lest the Spaniard, who by the Peace made at Verbin had taken to himself all the right of Authority in the Country beyond the Eems, should seize it, being so convenient to
infest the Hollanders, and at once withdraw it from the German Empire. Thus had he taken formerly Utrecht, Gelders, and other places beyond the Rhine: Thus had he seized Millain, and some peculiar appurtenances of the Empire, and at last Cambray; and all this without contra∣diction. Nor were the Letters and Messengers sent by Enno to the King and other Spanish Commanders without cause suspected by them. To these good words they added some gifts to the Embassador; however as yet all things at Embden were full of hatred and dissention, every one being suspicious of another. This also made the Hollanders more incensed against Enno, because his brother John, as we said before, having obtained licence from the Pope to marry with Enno's Daughter, to whom he was Uncle, promoted the Roman Rites in the Country of Paderborn, and did the Bishop's business there, breaking into the City upon them who had kept it upon pretence of liberty, raging against them with most exquisite torments, among whom the Consul of the Town was tormented, and afterwards cut in pieces. The latter end of Winter the Spaniard suddenly took and lost Wachtendonck. For a Fisherman being hired brought into the Castle fifteen souldiers under the com∣mand of Matthew Dulken, (he was the Governor of Stralen not far off) which were covered over with straw; and upon the approch of the Sentinel, that stretched forth his hand to help him up, drawing his sword he thrust him through; then all the souldiers leaped up, and strove to admit their companions that were on the other side of the river Neeres, forcing the bridges that were kept against them, which they did by that time their fellows who lay in ambush not far off arrived. But the garrison of the Town, although the Castle and
the Governor Rihoven were taken, began to raise a mount and battery against it, and with speed to bring thither Cannon. And by chance it happened, that two troups of Hollanders that had been abroad foraging rode by, which hearing of the Tumult, entred the Town; and presently souldiers being sent for to Berck and Moers, they begirt the Castle, and the sixth day after recovered it being sorely assaulted and withall wanting of provision. Not long after Grobbendon, laying some ambushes in the Champains of Brabant, surprised five troups of Maurician horse, and though he were inferior to them in number, killed near seventy of them: many men and horses were taken, and the rest fled. But this damage suffered by the horse was doubly recompensed by a more famous naval victory. For Frederick Spinola weary of an inglorious idleness, and hastning out of the greatness of his spirit to purchase honor and wealth by the wa∣sting of Zeland, furnished eight gallies of the big∣ger sort and four lesser with chosen souldiers out of the Camp before Ostend, besides a great number of slaves that rowed; and going out of the Haven of Scluys, the wind gently seconding his desires, he got over the Sands, and spying the Enemie's Fleet, chose a place to fight with them in, upon the open Sea. Three Zeland Ships of war had beset the Port, over which one Justus Moon had the Command, besides two Gallies, one of Holland, the other of Zeland: four of these (the fifth for want of wind being very far distant, and giving no other as∣sistence to the battel then with its great Guns) vo∣luntarily setting forward, Spinola set upon close at hand with a great outcry, compassing sometimes this, some∣times t'other, with more violence, as hope led him on, distressing them with the multitude of his shot, and, in∣deed,
over-powerfull for them, as well by the help of the weather as the number of his Ships and souldiers: for in the Hollanders Fleet were no more then six and thirty souldiers out of the Town of Flushing, who were armed with Muskets; but the company of Sea-men, being natu∣rally inclinable to war, skilled in the use of their Arms and Guns, both near at hand and at distance, freely gave wounds to their Enemies both with their Swords and Javelins. And now the fight grew so hot, that the very clouds of smoak had eclipsed the light from their eyes, so that it seemed to be a nocturnal fight, untill Frederick himself, with great valour and confidence assai∣ling one of the Enemies Ships, was killed with several wounds, and with him above three hundred others, be∣side many hurt: but the breaking of the Oares was the first thing that took away all hope of Victory from the Italians: hereupon they were surprised with fear, lest more Ships coming out of Zeland should encompass them on every side, and so in time they retreated to the Fleet. This victory of the Zelanders with so small loss, which happened because the ribs of their Ships were more solid and compact, and less open to the damage of the bullets, made that great terror of those at first unknown Vessels come to nothing, for that it was experimentally found, that they might be over∣come, even in the most calm and serene wea∣ther. There was no War any where untill the midst of Summer, but before Ostend, because the Hollanders not receiving those aids out of England and Scot∣land which they hoped, had enough to doe to defend their own; and the Arch-duke minding to take Berck and to pass the Rhine, for the perfecting these new designes, he procures new forces out of Spain and
Italy, under the conduct of Ambrose Spinola: besides he raised in Germany foot-souldiers, and in Lorrain horse-men; and after they arrived, Spinola being left at Ostend, seven thousand foot and three thousand horse were delivered to Frederick Count Heremberg, and his first orders were, to drive out those who had violently seated themselves in Hochstraten. This Philip had commanded as well for security sake at present, as for example sake in the future, and lest while he turned his Armes to other parts, they should invade the places left destitute of defence; for of late they had spoiled the Province of Namur, taken the Town of Jedin and the Governor of Carpen Castle, and yet returned safe and full of booty. At this time they in Hochstraten held a most severe discipline, and worthy of imitation by the best souldiers: their guards and watches were very diligently looked after, neither was any permitted to goe into a bed or put off his clothes while he took his rest; no women were suffered to come within the Castle; to fight a∣mong themselves, and to have any secret conferences or letters, was a capital offence. These laws were e∣stablished and confirmed by punishments of offenders without pardon. These understanding that they were like to be besieged, sent to the States and Prince Maurice, and beseech and beg their aide, promising upon their faith, that they would jointly and unani∣mously fight against the Enemy; but protesting that they would have all prisoners they should take at their own dispose, because the laws of War were usually denied among Enemies to such as were renegadoes. Eight hundred of them were shut up in the Castle; the rest, being fifteen hundred foot and above a thousand horse, expect Prince Maurice, who hearing that Count
Heremberg was now come, and began to doe all acts of hostility against the Castle, draws together little less then ten thousand foot and three thousand horse out of their Winter-quarters, and speeds with them to Geertruydenberg. In which City happened a sad spectacle, the French and English by mutual quarrells among themselves falling together by the ears, being Nations always emulous of one another: insomuch that now there began a perfect battel between the whole Regiments, some being killed, more wounded, and the Colonel of the French, Monsieur Bethune, himself running in between them to prohibit their fighting, was killed, which much incensed the minds of his men. Scarcely could the sight or speech of the Nassavian Commanders or of the Prince himself prevail to deterre the further increase of this impious and increasing slaughter. Here Prince Maurice's forces joyning with those of the seditious, they marched together, though souldiers of different obligations and principles, by a new and strange kind of example. Between the fields and the Enemies Camp was a little rivulet, the ground all about which is very moory: this Count Heremberg either by error, or tot suspecting the coming of Prince Maurice, had neglected to possess. The Prince having by prepared bridges brought over his souldiers and artillery, on a sudden faces the Enemy with his Army. But Count Heremberg kept himself within the safeguard of the place and the defence of his carriages, which he had placed in form of a rampier, onely the horse were commanded to advance, which produced some light skirmishes. Nor did Prince Maurice think meet to set upon the Enemies entire untill he had tried all places that might be advantageous to himself
or the Enemy. Count Heremberg fearing, as other things, so to be debarred of provisions, through the help of the night withdrew first his Cannon, and after∣wards his souldiers, towards Herentalls, in the mean while keeping watches against the Enemy, that he might be the better able to deceive them. But when the appearance of day-light had discovered their design, they which were in the Castle first fell in their rear, where among others was slain Rosney (the son of a famous Commander both in France and the Low-Countries,) who at that time commanded the Lorraign souldiers. But another small river hindred Prince Maurice from his intended pursuit of the E∣nemy, for that it was fordable onely with great diffi∣culty, besides the way was narrow and full of water; yet moving on forward with the horse he found the Enemy newly passed the streights, and his Army drawn into battalia in the open fields: and although the Hochstrateners were very earnest to fight, as well in their own revenge, as in giving a proof of their affection and valour to their new friends, yet it was not thought fit to fight this Army thus drawn up, and ordered without the foot and Artillery, which followed but slowly after over the difficulties of an uliginous way, besides the toilsome grievousness of the weather, which was disturbed with continual rain and tempests. Thus the siege being raised, Prince Maurice boldly threw himself into the midst of the seditious souldiers, that by this great confidence of them he might oblige them to him the more strictly. And now he again resolved, while part of the Enemies forces were with him, to besiege 's Hertogenbosch, which by the cruelty of the Winter the last year he was forced to break off, his confidence resting onely in celerity,
if the City could be surrounded void of a garrison, as it then was. But the matter being related to the Councel of the States, the Zelanders pressing to make war in Flanders, yet at last the Prince was permitted to doe what should seem most convenient to the Commonwealth, but in the mean while eight days were spent. And although Count Heremberg's forces were prepared and increased purposely to disturb all designs of the Prince, yet he continued in his reso∣lution, not so much out of any hopes of attaining the City, as because he would keep the Enemy busied in trifling, and himself not be compelled to the de∣fence of his own elsewhere, and to depend wholly up∣on uncertain events. Some were of opinion that the Townsmen, wearied with the miseries of war, would either alter their fidelity, or at leastwise doe that as should make them seem so moderate to both parties, that they should neither fear nor be feared. There∣fore the Summer being now well entred, the Prince sate down at the Village named Vuchten, and the Huhstrateners at Vlimen, in the way to Hoesden, there being a great distance of ground between the two Camps. The third day after Count Heremberg drew nigh, and in the woody places towards that part where the City lay open, in the Village of Dalem, fortified himself, casting up defences against Prince Maurice. He, on the other side, erected some Sconces and Batteries with great Guns, where the ground ceasing to be plain swells up into little hills; and much time was carelesly spent in light skirmishes and wasting of shot. At last Heremberg was advised to erect a Fort without the City, near the way that leads from Vuchten to Vlimen, to this intent, that the passage being stopped from Prince Maurice's Camp
to that of the Hochstrateners, a more hopefull oppor∣tunity might be expected against them being divided, or that by a scarcity of Victualls, which were brought from Hoesden to the Camp, the siege might be removed or broken up of necessity. The charge of this busi∣ness was: committed to the Marquesse of Bella, Colonel of the Italians, with two thousand souldiers, the flour of divers Regiments; which being carried round about the City in the night, had brought the designed work to some perfection, the ground being thrown up and mingled with faggots to the height of a man: whereof the Prince receiving intelligence, not till it was very late in the night, he with the most active and valiant of his men flying thither, excited every one to this no less difficult then necessary busi∣ness. The English valiantly made the first assault, and were no less courageously repulsed; but the French strongly seconding them, soon made the place too hot for the Enemy, and the gates of the Town being shut, they having no place of refuge to fly to, nor any relief to assist them, were slain together with their Commander, or drowned in the adjoyning marishes: about one hundred and fifty were taken prisoners. It happened by chance about the same time, that the Arch-duke at Ostend striving to re∣strain the going in and out of the souldiers by some sharp and severe punishments, getting a Ship which stuck upon the Shallows, wherein were onely twelve sick souldiers, he hanged them all, pretending they were not taken at land, but upon the Sea, where there are no laws of Arms to be observed: the news of which being brought to the Camp, Prince Maurice esteeming it an act of great cruelty and wickedness, not having any relation to a war at Sea, that he might make the
Laws of Arms setled among all Enemies to be of esteem, by a return of the like cruelty caused twelve, chosen at hap-hazard out of the whole number of pri∣soners, to be hanged, yet one of them out of pity to his tender age was spared; though some did not stick to averre, that the known and well-approved law of covenants being infringed so barbarously, ought to be expiated not onely with the punishment of the like, but rather of a double number. Certainly it was a sad sight, and not to be forgotten among the many evils of war, when young men of good breeding and in∣genuity, and not deserving any such thing, with sor∣rowfull countenances, trembling hands, and between prayers and sighs, not so much fearing death as the ignominious kind thereof, should draw and look upon their fates inclosed in bits of paper, either of con∣demnation for anothers fault, or of pardon not for innocencie's sake, but the chance of fortune. Yet there was one found of so desperate a temerity, who by his own good luck set free, yet, hired by another, once more put his life in jeopardy for the safeguard of the other. But the Townsmen defended themselves onely by shot: yet it fortuned that the Marquesse of Malaspina and one Oliver Tempel, passing from the Prince's to the Vlimian Camp, had both their legs broken at one shot. Malaspina was a person much knowing in all Albertus his counsells of war, and being lately taken prisoner by the Hochstrateners survived, though in a very weak condition. But Oliver died of his wound, having fought on the States behalf above twenty years, so that now he was Judge-Advocate of the Army, and besides at that time was set over the Hochstrateners, by his reason to keep in order their violence. Afterwards Albertus himself came to the
City, and trying all things, observed that there was a slight Sconce built by the Mauricians in a square forme, not far from the place where the Marquesse of Bella was lately slain. Of this place the Arch-duke saying, it was necessary to be taken, (and without doubt for the future it would have been of great use to him) news thereof was privily conveyed and brought to the Prince by the intelligence of a souldier that fled from them to him. Some days being past, one night, a little before the break of day, making as if they intended an assault in divers places, their main strength wholly aimed at the destined place. Nor did Prince Maurice being forewarned of the danger omit at the same time to draw down thither the most courageous both of his own men, and some of the choicest of the Hochstrateners, putting out all the fires. The appearance of the day discovered a Battery of nine great Guns opposite to the Fort, and others directed from the Town-Bulwarks and other Fortresses, wherewith the Sconce being vio∣lently battered on all hands was so shattered, that the souldiers hid themselves in the hollow places of the ground; yet the Prince came to them, and threatned severely to hang any that should desert the place. At the same time he placed a circle of musketiers round the whole circumference of the Trench, and commanded three Cannon to be brought out of the Camp, wherewith the Enemies strength being repress'd, and the assailants forced to be∣come defendants, leaving the Boats which they had brought for the more easy passing the interjacent marishes, and scarcely saving their great Guns, the Mauricians took all the Mattocks, Faggots, Hurdles and other things prepared for destruction, and con∣verted
them all to the repairing and augmentation of their own Works. The Arch-duke designing several at∣tempts against the Enemy, (which indeed was the main cause of his coming) commanded three thousand Soul∣diers, which he pretended should onely march through the Town, to remain there in Garrison; which made the Citizens complain grievously of the breach of those Co∣venants which for twenty years together had been invi∣olably preserved. But necessity and the fear of punish∣ment quickly made them silent; also there was a strong Fortress raised close by the City, which might serve in∣stead of a Castle, though it had not the name of one. And at the beginning of Winter, the ground being ma∣rishy and full of water, the Armies departed. When the seditious, whose labours this year had been great and exemplary, desiring another place of safety might be gi∣ven them for Hochstraten, wherein they might have more room, and that lay more convenient for forage; the matter hanging long in debate before the States, Prince Maurice of his own accord admitted them into Grave, a Town belonging to himself, that they might remain within the Walls, and have the command of all the Bul∣warks about it, but not to doe any injury to the Citizens. And the Covenants formerly made were renewed and confirmed, concerning the dividing of the spoil, and that they should not infest or spoil any of the Countries be∣longing either to the Germane Empire or the United States: as long as they continued at difference with Albertus, they should not spare their best pains and la∣bour, yet so as they alwaies should remain separate in all marches, and be free from all servile works of digging and assaults: that when they should be reconciled, they should restore Grave and receive Hochstraten, for perfor∣mance whereof they engaged their faith and gave pled∣ges.
These were the transactions in those parts, while in the interim about Ostend the Warre greatly increased and therewith not the charge onely, but the political inventions and stratagems also. And now the Winter being past, that had sometimes been offensive to these, other-while to those, as the force of the wind drove the waters and made them more turbulent; in the middle of the Spring a fierce assault was made from the Camp upon all the quarters of the Town; and when the De∣fendants were not able to sustain so violent and sprea∣ding a force, three Forts were taken by the Enemy, (which lying on the backside of the Town, at the con∣flux of the waters, we mentioned before to be slightly guarded) and some few daies after the besieged ma∣king a sally upon the same places, which wanted suc∣cess, made the Enemy not onely encrease the number of his Guards, but to put therein of his choicest men. But other small Forts beyond the Gollet assaulted by Bucquoy were successfully maintained. Colonel Dor∣pen was then Governour of the Town, whose time be∣ing spent, he was succeeded by Colonel Notte. To∣wards the middle of Summer Ambrose Count Spinola came to Ostend, promising an end to this hard (and by some esteemed desperate) work, if he might have the chief command in the Camp. Nor did he undertake this out of any vain temerity, but by the sound infor∣mations of those by whom both the place and me∣thod of the Warre were well understood, especially af∣ter the way was found through the water over great piles of wood, a work onely of time and diligence, whereby the Works of the Town might be taken from them as it were by piece-meal. And this desire of Spi∣nola was the more easily consented to by King Phi∣lip, because besides many eminent vertues of a noble
minde, whereof he had given certain testimonies, he offered also out of his private wealth to prescribe a re∣medy to the affairs of the Treasury at that time very much out of order. He was at first very greatly en∣vied, because being an Italian, and but newly come into the Warre, among so many Netherlanders and Spa∣niards, he commanded at once both the Souldiers and Treasury: but he diligently minding all things, and following the most prudent, by little and little over∣came it And presently removed such as had made a gain of the Treasury, having prepared his own pro∣visions, because there was need of money to prevent mutinies and running away. Besides, the hope of re∣wards had brought thither the most famous Wits of Christendome, among whom there was great emula∣tion in finding out new waies of approching, batte∣ring and assaulting Towns, and as any ones inventions came to most perfection in the executive part, so was the care of the General more ready to gratifie him with a certain reward. No less valour or industry was shewn by the besieged, for they took care, lest their provisions should be streightned, that all commanded allowances should be publickly delivered; and, for their defence, were unwearied in their Watches yea, and sometimes were confident enough to make Sallies; be∣sides, what either the violence of the Enemy or the Sea had thrown down, they employed skilful workmen to repair. To believe so great a number of men shut up in so narrow a compass, and obnoxious to so many dan∣gers, wounds and labours, and yet to finde no contagion bred among them, next to the providence of God, must needs be attributed partly to the extraordinary care of the Chirurgeons and Physicians, and partly to the care of the States, which alwaies caused the sick or woun∣ded
with all diligence to be carried thence. Moreover, besides the harm they did by burning bullets and hand-granadoes and the like new inventions, they did other great damage to the Enemies materials being now through dry by the heat of the weather. The chief la∣bour of the Assailants was concerning some Boats that were built for the carriage of great Guns, by the same Engineer which we mentioned before, Targon a Ro∣mane, a man of a very subtle wit, but altogether un∣experienced in Martial affairs. Part of these were sent to the left hand of the Town, where the Sea was not so boisterous, to the Forts that lay nearest to the En∣my; but on the right hand, where the Gollet is, the shot being unequally levelled, they did little or no harm, most of them being spoiled by the impetuousness of the waters, because stones being bound up in great bundles of wood, the bands thereof quickly breaking, the rest floated, having lost the weight that kept it down. Yet was not Spinola dismayed thereat, but still added more Boats to the former, learning new waies of Fortification, from the very experience they gained from their losses: And the battery of Count Bucquoy being by little and little advanced nearer the Town, it came to pass that Ships came in and out with more difficulty to bring in Souldiers, Victuals, Guns, or Gunpowder, some after that falling upon the Shallows, or being swallowed up in the Sea, when they had in stri∣ving to enter endured the fury of the Enemies Artillery. Against the shot from the Town the Besiegers partly chose the night, partly used Works made of earth to keep out the water, wherein were transfixed several rows of Piles and Faggots, where they had setled in places of more safety; otherwise they sunk great Vessels filled with stuff underneath the water.
But in Spain with the King, who in the practice of his Affairs did most things by the counsel ot Strangers, not his own judgement, sometimes new counsels were preferred before old, other times the old regained their former repute, as the authority of persuading or hope of the event led every one. Some averred that it was a great error of State to forbid the Hollanders traffick with Spain, they being a People potent at Sea, and seeking Merchandise from the farthest parts of the earth, either by Arms or otherwise, and going to the Indies, to the no small (though new and hitherto unheard of) damage of the Spaniards. With how much more wisedome did his Father attain a hope of Peace from that custome of the Provinces among themselves, ha∣ving alwaies a convenient number of Ships, as often as occasion required made ready for him by his very E∣nemies? If a remedy should be sought for present and future mischiefs, it must be by taking away necessity from the Hollanders; for that very thing first shewed them their own strength. This counsel, in it self not absurd, was yet found fault with and disallowed by covetousness: for though Trade was publickly confir∣med by Edict, yet there was so great a Tribute and Cu∣stome, besides what was formerly, laid upon all Mer∣chandise, that it amounted to little less then the third part of the price of the commodity; to wit, thirty in the hundred was to be paid to the King's Exchequer. And this was not laid upon the Hollanders onely, but all other Nations, lest otherwise the Hollanders should shelter themselves under the names of others; and for some private causes of hatred against those by whose assistence it was believed the Warre was supported. Onely some immunity was granted to those that lived within the Arch-duke's Territories, or should impor
any thing into his inland Sea. And this was added as a clause peculiar to the Hollanders, that it should not be lawful to import any Merchandises made by them∣selves, nor should any of those things be paid to their Pilots for wages, which they either imported or expor∣ted. Besides, they were commanded to take the Arch∣duke's safe conduct with them. Which things being very grievous and unjust, did not onely not prevail against the United States, but much incensed the King of France also: so that first, he laid the like Impositions upon the Spaniard; and when that seemed not a sufficient revenge, he forbade all the French to Trade into Spain so long as Philip's Edict remained in force, on pain first to lose all their goods, and after that to receive corpo∣ral punishment. Nor did the Archduke's dissembled clemency succeed any ber, when he proclaimed safe∣ty of return to all living among or dealing with the Enemy, and not blasted with any other crime, and that whatsoever they had formerly possessed, and was now in the Exchequer, should be restored to them, onely debarring them of the power of alienation. The words of this Edict were filled with many fraudulent deceits: for all kinde of Religion was directed to be punished thereby except the Romane; and the settlement of their Families detained many in Holland, as well as the cer∣tainty of the gain they made there. About this time the Hollanders suffered some small damages by the Dun∣kerkers; among the rest, they took some Holland Ships, out of the very Thames, being deceived by the Pirates bearing the same colours with their Companions. On the other side the Indian Company sent thirteen Ships to the East Indies, commanded by Stephen Van Hague: and the States sent out six others, under the command of Paul Carden, to spoil the coast of Brasile.
This Winter was sharp and very tempestuous, by force whereof a Whale was driven up the Schelde, and found not farre from Antwerp, which, for the rarity of the thing, yielded the Vulgar matter of discourse, drawing Omens of good or evil from the meanest of creatures. Some a year before this vented threats against that City, which proved farre more vain then terrible, as the event afterwards proved. The Thirteenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1604.AMONG all these things, Albertus did not omit consultations of Peace, either out of a real hope that he might attain the same, or that he might throw upon the Enemy the envy▪ for the refusal thereof: to which intent the Count Bassiguy, son of Boxtel, by the Archduke's command required a safe conduct from the States. They returned Answer, That if be would treat by Letters, they would he ready, but they could not consent that he should come to them. The Arch-duke resolved for this cause, and by occasion of the late troubles of Embden, that he would accuse the Hollanders as Enemies of his and their Neighbours peace at the Germane Diet held at Ratisbone, whereof his brother Matthias was the Moderator. And there were some who, out of affection to the House of Au∣stria, or for the difference of Religion, were very bit∣ter in their Opinions, crying out that there should be
appointed Articles for settlement of Peace, and they that refused to lay down Arms voluntarily should be compelled by force. The more moderate were against the using of force, making onely a decree for sending an Embassy to the States; and while that was preparing, the Emperour in the mean while sent Letters, wherein he recited all the evils done to the neighbour-Princes, and what several Cities had suffered, commanding them to make restitution of whatever they had taken away by violence. Moreover he laid to their charge, not onely what their own Souldiers had done, but also the rapines committed by the Hochstrateners, in regard they had undertaken their defence. Whereto the States, excusing what belonged to themselves, said that the faults of the seditious Souldiers ought to be ascribed to them that with the danger of others would defraud the Souldiers they hired of their pay. That they had sought nothing but their own safety, and yet as much as they could they had in all Covenants consulted the peace of Germany. But these injuries were not so ea∣sily wiped off by good words, since that in the beginning of this year (which we are now entring upon) the se∣ditious left nothing undone towards the Germans which is usual towards an Enemy, slighting all their threats, so long as they proceeded no further then words. For that Winter after they had sacked Eindhoven in Bra∣bant, and Erkelen a Town in Gelderland, rich with the prey there for many years heaped together by Al∣bertus his Souldiers, they fell upon a Troup going out of Gelderland, and besides took the Castle of Carpen well and fitly seated for excursions, having in all these actions the Hollanders Horse to accompany them; and assoon as they were departed, they fell into West phalia, compelling the Towns and Country to redeem them∣selves
from fear by the payment of Tribute. They shot off their Guns at Colen, and killed near four hun∣dred, Paderbornians, for two Souldiers killed by the oors, while they behaved themselves with great inso∣lency. Moreover, they raged with all kinde of lust and cruelty, even to the burning of Towns; so that, if even those unhappy people deserved pity, it was now, when for so many years they had been afflicted with all the miseries of a forein Warre, more grievously al∣most then if they themselves had been engaged in the Quarrel. The States, perceiving the danger of Ostend to draw right, resolved to drive the Enemy from the siege, or draw him off, or to attempt another place, whereby they right both preserve their honour, and keep a passage in¦to Flanders; wherefore gathering together money in time, and levying Souldiers on all hands, they obtained a new Regiment of Scots under Colonel Barclay, and some recruits of English, not, as formerly, by authority of the King, but onely by his permission. In the middle of the Spring, while part of the Horse with the seditious of the Enemy fall into Brabant, and the report of the Warre spred into every place amused the Enemy; the Prince, accompanied with the Senate and Deputies of the Spares, carried out of Walcheren into Cazant his Army, consisting of about twelve thousand. This Cazant is a Region in Flanders which the Sea beats upon, and on that side towards the East is compassed with the River Ateren, on the other with the large Haven of Scluys, and on the backside with other waters, like an Island. From the River Ateren the Army was landed, which cer∣tainly was a great over-sight, that it was not carried into the Haven of Scluys, which was the opinion of the Coun∣cel of the States: from which if the Prince had not
been dissuaded by others, out of a fear of greater dan∣ger, he might have taken the Town by force, having then a very little or no Garrison; and had also come upon them at Ostend while they were full of fear, and be∣fore they were aware, and dispersed farre distant one from another; or else he might if he pleased have fought them, or at least have stopped all provision from the Enemy. In the mean while, Souldiers sent from the Camp at Ostend and elsewhere had filled the farther bank of the Haven at Sclays, Spinola taking care for it, who before had sent forth several Spies and Scouts, that were to bring word of the coming of the Fleet. And although the Holland Ships of Warre had compelled the Ene∣mies Gallies to retreat to the Town; for fear the mouth of the Haven should be stopped, they battered with their Cannon a small ort situate on the opposite bank; for he could not put over thither any Souldiers, having twice In vain attempted it; Pompey Justinno making resistence with two thousand men. This Gentleman was the chief of all the Colonels in Spinola's counsels; and besides the honour of his knowledge in Martial affairs, he moed very well in his accurate writing thereof. And how Prince Maurice inquiring what way he might best take to goe into the inner part of Flanders, by chance a Countryman, flying from thence to escape a small party of the Enemy that was come thither and pursued also, shewed him a Ford in that channel which compasseth Cazant behinde, where a bank being raised, and the adjoyning Fort taken called Coxen, a Bridge and Garri∣son was placed, they having time enough free from the Enemy, while Triolci and Justiniano differed in coun∣sel among themselves. There were two other Fortres∣ses hard by called by the names of Katharine and P∣, which yielded sooner then could be hoped or ima∣gined:
for Katharine Sconce being sorely bruised with bullets, was deserted by Trivulci, even when Prince Maurice despairing of the work had commanded his Artillery to he drawn off; nor did Trivulci onely goe o with his Souldiers, but the tumultuary band of Country-men that were mixed with them; for they hearing a noise, which was of the Enemie's marching away, which they interpreted to be an increase of their Forces, and that they were coming to shut up all the Avenues, fled to Fort Philip, nor staid they there, but psted to Ysendike, leaving in Philips Fort threescore in number, who upon sight of the Enemy with all speed delivered the place. Thence for the winning of Ysen∣ke (which is a Fort in the utmost coast of Flanders  the Hont) a siege was thought necessary; for all the Enemy that were driven from other places had here ed themselves, to the number of six hundred: and the seventh day after the place was surrendred. Prince Maurice being busied there, the Enemy approched in hope to recover Cazant, and in the night endevoured to have passed in Boats to that purpose provided. And  six hundred were come thither unobserved, others following them; but at last being spied by the Scots, who had the charge of the place, these Enemies by their lotons force were quickly put to flight and killed. Behinde Scluys lies Ardenburg, now shewing onely the remains of a sometimes farre more noble Town; this the Prince, finding the Souldiers that were left for the defence thereof fled, entred, and commanded the same to be fortified: and passing from Middleburg (which is a free City not farre off) and in the Castle, which is the onely place of defence, placing Souldiers, he now began to revolve in his minde the siege of Scluys. Be∣cause the Enemy had preoccupied all the places lying
between Ostend, he spread himself to the two Rivers which from Damme and Bruges pass to Scluys, being divided by a small limit, yet so different in tast, that from thence they have attained the names of salt and fresh water: but where the Lake named Merkerk streightens the way leading thither, (as indeed almost all that Coun∣try is full of water) Lewis Velasco by the Arch-duke's command had fortified himself, and going out with a strong Party, Fortune smiling upon the Enemies, in the attempt they made upon those they first met, before the Horse that were added to him could come in to his help, he with his whole number was overthrown; five hundred almost were drowned, and three hundred ta∣ken: and thus they came to the Rivers; and although the Enemy had planted himself between, on one part dissembling, on the other side finding a passage, first went over at a Ford, and afterwards over Bridges to that purpose builded. Hence grew so great a terror, that the Forts were deserted which lie to the Eastward from the Haven of Scluys, excepting onely one called S. George, which yet was quickly delivered, more out of fear then necessity, upon sight of the Cannon drawn be∣fore it. The Garrison going abroad, they found the deceit of an evil custome: a lighted match being placed by the Barrels of Gunpowder, to have blown up the same, and ruined all near thereabouts. Then the Prince pitch∣ed three Camps between the Town and the Sea-shore, over which himself, Count William and Count Ernest had the Command. That which was beyond the Rivers, lying every where under water, he commanded Colo∣nel Notte to keep, to that purpose giving him some Boats, and from thence a Breast-work to be drawn as farre as Ardenburg, whereon frequent Guards to be kept. But before they were able perfectly to surround
the Town with their Works, the Souldiers twice broke into Scluys through the Marishes, and in so great num∣ber, through the Governour's neglect, that it was belie∣ved they were sufficient to have defended the Town against him; for there was within but little Victuals, and the number of those that eat it was increased; and that made Justiniano with a strong Guard bring provi∣sions into the parts near the Town, which they were to meet him and receive: but the design being discovered, Prince Maurice, hastning with some Horse and Artille∣ry, drove away the Enemy, and took some Carts loaden with Meal, and a few men. Fifty of the Slaves belonging to Spinola, that with some others had come forth of the City, fled over to the Prince, by whose intelligence he was more certainly informed that there was Victuals in the Town onely for a short season; that they made a great shew of many things, the better to deceive and delude their Enemies. Hereupon a Fast was proclaimed in the Camp, which is customary with them going to attempt any difficult and dangerous matter; after which they planted their great Guns, and made a Bridge of a won∣derful bigness, as if therewith they would goe beyond the broad and deep gulf of the Haven even unto the Rampier: but indeed some despairing, they stayed one∣ly to pinch the Enemy with Famine, and to that end they were more diligent in shutting up all the Avenues, not would receive any more fugitives; in the interim the Horse plundering Flanders. Now was the Arch-duke pressed with many great dis∣commodities at once, and the fear of the seditious hin∣dred him so, that he durst not leave one Army at Ostend, and with another goe towards the Enemy: for the se∣ditions having at this time covenanted with the Hol∣landers for one half of the prey they should take, made
incursions into Brubant, and were going into Henan therefore supposing it necessary to gain these to him∣self, though with the loss of honour and money, and the rather because others by their example beginning to threaten the like, their number was like to be increased, he offered them terms of reconciliation. And although they did not presently agree, because they would not endure to hear that the prey which they had got should be owned as part of their pay, yet their minds being mo∣lified by treaty and discourse, and for purging their for∣mer crimes, they turned all their strength against the Country of Liege, or where they had remained in the Arch-duke's lands, they exacted their tributes; and in other things being indempnified, they were reconciled, the Mauricians in vain urging their promises, whom they despised as being inferiour to them in number. Be∣sides, the States were possessed with no small fear, lest that unfaithful company should seek to regain the favour of their old acquaintance by the delivery of Grave, to the high mockery of their easie credullty. But either shame, or the fear of revenge from the Arch-duke, if they should be destitute of a place of refuge in case of necessity, made them restore the Town, receiving the Castles of Hochstratn and Carpn, which they let the Arch-duke enjoy: and while their pay was provided for them, Roernd was delivered to them as a pledge, and several other noble Hostages. Yet, notwithstand∣ing all this, some of them absolutely came over to the Prince. Two thousand of them by Albertus order came into Flanders, which being a good recruit to his Forces, and the Garrisons of other Regions by that means with the more safety being drained, he urged Spinola that he would think of the relief of Scluys, which was no lon∣ger able to endure the Famine: And he, although against
as will, and with good reason judging that Ostend was now at the last point of defence, obeyed his command. The first offer he made was with Cannon planted not  from the Lake Merkerk, by the shot thereof to ve away the Guards: But a greater force of Artillery ing brought by the Souldiers of the Leaguer drove  away, and made that design of no effect. Afterwards e set upon Count William's Camp with some choice Re∣ents of Foot and Troups of Horse, and all other warlike preparation fit to destroy Bulwarks; but he was beaten back also thence with great loss of bloud. Coming back thence, and forcing the two Forts called Katherine and Philip, (wherein were but few Souldiers) e strove by night to enter that way into Cazant over the Fords, while the water was low: that also was dis∣covered, and fresh Souldiers continually sent to defend the banks. That day gave an evident example of the Spa∣nish Souldiers constancy, who keeping their ranks un∣doutedly laboured both against a strong Bulwark and a thick cloud of bullets. No less was the valour of the Defendents, especially of many of the French Nobility: And the Prince himself was present, still adding supplies of fresh men to such as were tired. Thus as the day increased, and the water grew higher by the loud, the Enemy was beaten off not without the death of many, and those of the nobler sort, among whom the Marquess of Renty, son to the Lord Montigny, formerly a famous Commander of the King's Party among the Netherlan∣ders. They that came forth of the Town then first be∣gan to know what was violent hostility, being owned among the dead by the fresh memory of their fellow∣ship in Warre. The besieged, when they saw no hope of relief, and that their hunger had consumed not onely the most vile and loathsome creatures, but also whatever
they could finde of skins or tallow, at the end of the third month delivered the Town. There marched out of it three thousand Souldiers, who had scarce left with∣in them any remains of life, part of whom died as they went away. Seventy great Guns were taken, ten Galleys, and about fourteen hundred slaves, to whom their liberty was given: Most of the Turks and Moors were sent home with Letters, thereby to purchase fa∣vour and free trade among those Barbarians. Aurelius Spinola, the cousin of Ambrose, was dismissed upon this condition, that the Holland Seamen which the Arch∣duke kept Prisoners should be released. Cazant, Yse∣dike and Scluys with the Haven were all new streng∣thened, and their Works repaired: The Forts named Philip and Katharine the Enemy had levelled With the ground; and the Government of Flanders was commit∣ted by the States to Count Henry of Nassau, under whom Colonel Charles Notte was Deputy Governour. Ostend yet held out, among all the labours and di∣stresses suffered from the Enemy, the Sea and Diseases, having at this time a small breathing space, while the Enemie's care was divided for securing the Towns of Flanders. In the Government of Ostend Colonel Notte was succeeded by Gistell, upon whose death Lone came in place, whose successor was Daniel Marquette. Ma∣ny of the Colonels and Captains on both sides were dead. Many new inventions were at this Siege found out by the besiegers: of which one was a Bridge, a stru∣cture of Targon's, with brazen wheels, and was drawn by horses; one part of it was bound together with Cables, that it might not be easily penetrated with shot: this by the ejection of a beam was lifted up on high, so that it might fall down by loosing the ropes that held it up. This they placed upon a platform, which, as we
related before, was in the form of a half-moon beyond the Gollet. But this vast and sumptuous work soon be∣came ridiculous, one of the wheels being strucken off with the bullets; afterwards some Poles, as high as a Ship∣mast, being fixed in the trench of the Bulwark, by them that massy Engine was broken and spoiled: Therefore they turned all their force against the West part, and drew some lines beyond the old Haven, and on the backside of the Town. And now the outermost Work that joyned to the Town was taken, for part of it being blown up with gun-powder, it was in vain to defend the rest. Then the Porcupine and Helmont by little and little decayed and were lost. And now was the whole face of affairs full of horror, for the Enemy to get into the Town, and they on the other side to keep him out, were unawares and in the dark intangled one among another in caves and passages under ground, and by the uncertain signs of fire, oftentimes those devices turning to the damages of their authors. The Spaniards and Ita∣lians being worn out by long dangers, (for every one had his proper station and business, that it might the more clearly be looked after, and kindle emulation in each other) the Germans were inticed with rewards to assault Sand-hill▪ and though the first of them were scat∣tered by the force of gun-powder out of a Mine, yet Barlaymont drove on the rest, until they attained the top of the place. From hence they went by secret waies under ground into the old Town; sometimes the be∣sieged sallied, and in stead of the Works which they had lost, they raised new ones more inwardly, which out of a vain humour and conceit of the long continuing of the siege they named Troy. For the fresh ground being in it self loose, and not sufficient to resist the shot, though it was in the midst of Summer, as often as the
wind blew off from the Sea, all things were laid open to ruine. Insomuch that now the States themselves be∣gan to consider the infinite charge, and the losses of the Souldiers not much inferiour to the greatest Bat∣tels, and that Ostend it self being so inclosed with Forts could be of no use. Besides, whether they looked at honour or profit, they had gotten more of either in three months in the winning of Scluys, besides Berck and Grave, then Albertus would get by Ostend, which he had contested for so many years. And now the greatest part of Autumn being spent, time was past for the Ene∣my to undertake any thing else, and Winter was coming, which was both dangerous and dreadful to the besieged. And if they should goe thither with an Army, first the way was full of water, and in the middle was Dam and Blankenbrg, Garrisons of the Enemy; besides, by length of time the Camps were well setled, the Forces united, and both Commanders and Souldiers were used to fight, all which threatned great hazards to such an attempt. Therefore command was given to Colonel Marquette, that he should set an end to that tedious con∣flict upon as honourable terms as he could; which was accordingly done. And first of all the Ships and other Vessels were sent away with part of the Artillery: Then Commissioners were sent, who desired that all in the Town might freely march out with their Arms and four Cannon, and that all Prisoners should be exchan∣ged; which Spinola easily granted, either out of an high estee of their approved valour, or to prevent other uncertain events which time might produce. Three thousand, marching through the midst of the Enemie's Camp, came to Scluys to the Prince, who received them not as overcome, but gave them praises and thanks as Conquerors. The Arch-duke with his Princely Spouse
came to see the place, for which they had offered up so many vows, and been at so infinite an expence of mo∣ney, time and bloud, (themselves protesting the loss of fifty thousand men, and that a greater number of the besieged was killed.) They found nothing but an empty and confused plat of ground; here full of rude and mis∣shapen heaps, there falling into great and uneven holes, with such confused remains of Fortifications, that by looking thereon, one could scarce imagine which were made for the defence, or which for the assailing the Town. The Townsmen that lived there before went thence to Scluys; and although the Arch-duke granted many Privileges to the place, yet of a long time none would inhabit it, looking upon it as a place of hor∣rour, and defiled with the bloud and bones of dead men, which is generally repugnant to the nature of most men. Besides those Embassadors which I mentioned before, King Philip and the Arch-duke sent into England more: to wit, this sent Don John Richardot, and Don Lewis Verrcikem; but he, Don Ferdinando Velasco Constable of Castile, and Don Alexandro Roverti a Senator of Mil∣lan; both of them very desirous of Peace, not so much out of fear of the English, as that they might draw the Hollanders to reason, by taking away their props and supporters. Nor wanted there some in that warlike Nation that persuaded to Warre, repeating in the En∣glish Parliament (which was then met) the ancient al∣liances with the Hollanders, the many leagues and mar∣riages, long before Philip Duke of Burgundy unjustly drove Jacoba married to a Britan out of her Principa∣lity: And the reason given for this amity was, that without it the Sea could be safe to neither, and it would grow from thence that Trading would be full and free.
On the contrary, the Spaniards had no need of Peace, for Warre was more beneficial to them. And it was chiefly to be provided that the Hollanders should not by extremity be compelled to joyn either with the French, the ancient Enemies of Great Britain, or the Spaniards, Enemies for Religion sake and the thirst of Dominion. It hath been evident by too many ex∣amples, that who had the dominion of the Sea would easily be Master of Britain. But the King not at all moved herewith, and supposing there was strength enough both in Britain and Holland, for that, to main∣tain Peace, and this, Warre; thereupon refusing the society of Arms offered against the Spaniard, he agreed to a Peace. Besides the Articles usual in Leagues, there were added certain concerning free Navigation, such as was before the Warre, and upon paiment of the same Customes. Nothing was spoken of America or the In∣dies, because the English would not endure to be exclu∣ded, and the Spaniard was obstinate to admit none; so that matter was left to the decision of him that was most potent. Concerning Religion it was agreed, That the English should not be compelled in Spain to goe to their Churches: That when they met the consecrated Host, they should doe reverence thereto, unless they chose rather to goe out of the way. These that follow pertained to the Hollanders: viz. That neither of them should help the others Enemies or Rebels, nor should suffer them to be helped by any of their Subjects: That the facts of private persons should be answered for by themselves, but the publick Peace not be hazarded thereby. But the Britans denied to deliver the Briel or Flushing to the Spaniard, affirming it was contrary to the faith contained in their Articles: in the interim the Souldiers that kept those Towns should be uncon∣cerned
in the Warre, but should doe their endeavours for pacifying the Hollanders; and if that were delaied, yet that at least there should be an open and free pas∣sage for the Netherlanders and English in point of trade: That there should not reside at one time in the Ports of either above six or eight of the others Ships of Warre: That the English should be forbidden to carry the Hol∣landers Commodities into Spain, or the Spanish Mer∣chandises into Holland. Thus that Warre being ended, King James, that he might take away the cause of all intestine discords, by obliterating the names of Scots and English, would have both to be united and grow up into one Kingdome by communicative Laws, and to be called Britain, undertaking herein a difficult matter, and which was agitated with great contentions, while the yet fresh differences and emulations would hardly allow thereof, as the foundation of a solid good to po∣sterity. Soon after, according to these agreements with Albertus, he requires the Hollanders not to pro∣hibit the Britans to come out of the Sea into the Scheld to pass to Antwerp, paying Customes equal to their Subjects. But they excused it, by shewing that they had good reason for their Decree, that none should goe to the Enemy, unless they first changed their Ships, that so they might the more certainly have know∣ledge of all things. Nor ought he to take it ill, that they imposed Laws upon a River within their own Jurisdiction, when the Spaniards durst deny the pas∣sage of the Seas even to their friends. And so that he might convert the English, who were accused as infamous for Piracy, to innocent gain, he forbad any to fight at Sea under a forein command, but conni∣ving at any that went hither or thither to a land Warre.
By another Edict the Jesuites and all other Eccle∣siastical persons that received not sacred. Orders ac∣cording to the custome of the Kingdome of Britain were banished thence, setting out for cause, that that sort of men taught that the Pope might absolve Sub∣jects from their obedience to Kings of another Religion, then which there is not any opinion more dangerous to Government. But at the same time the same Je∣suites were restored in France upon some conditions, from whence they had formerly been banished, when by their instructions a young man fought to murther the King. But now the monument was destroyed which kept the memory of that fact fresh, together with the Jesuites infamy; the Parliament of Paris crying out, that by that one work the authority of the most honourable Order and the security of France were sub∣verted together. But the King, with his own great dan∣ger, as many ominously feared, unterrified, merely to gratifie the Pope, admitted and favoured these stout de∣fenders of his power. Between this King and the Spaniard arose some new causes of hatred upon old discontents. Mon∣sieur Villeroy, a person highly entrusted and favoured by King Henry, had a servant named Hostius, whose industry and ingenuity (himself being much imployed otherwise) he used in the decyphering and reading of Letters and private Characters. This man, being hi∣red, gave intelligence of all the greatest affairs of State to one Monsieur Raffee a French-man, but banished and living in Spain, who discovered them to King Phi∣lip's Counsellors: by which having such insight into all the private counsels of France, it was easie for them to guess at all things else: Some things also being discovered to the King of Britain, had ingendred
animosities and jealousies. This Treason being dete∣cted by Raffee, Hostius first by flight, and afterwards by a sudden death, prevented further inquisition. There was also at this time another matter stirred up by a Woman, which was this: Henrica, the daughter of Monsieur Interaque, was esteemed among the first for her beauty and pleasantness of wit; wherewith the King being allured, (to whom there was hardly any other crime to be objected then these loose Affections) the better to compass the end of his unlawful desires, had promised her marriage, if she bare him a Son; and this promise he confirmed to her by writing. Af∣ter Medices was preferred before her in marriage, she was compelled, to pacifie the Queen, to deliver up this writing of the King's. Whereupon dissembling higher designs under the pretence of solitude and Re∣ligion, she aimed to compass forein wealth, wherewith she might secure her Son against the Queen's anger and malice, and not onely so, as she publickly decla∣red, (and as others interpreted it) but also that he might therewith assert his right and claim to the King∣dome. The King of Britain refused to give any ear to them for the disturbance of another's Kingdome; but the Spaniard approved her cause, and promised largely to assist her therein. When these things first became known, the Lady her self, her Father and Bro∣ther, the Count of Auvergne, were taken; but King Hen∣ry pardoned them, acknowledging his own misdemea∣nour in their crime. But Philip fearing, lest Henry enraged with these things should from thence take a cause to make Warre, he ended the quarrel begun about the Customes, which he had lately raised by Edict; and turning his fury against the Hollanders, commanded all of that Nation to depart out of his
Dominions, and all Merchandise afterwards brought in to be forfeited. This year was celebrated in the Netherlands a so∣lemn Funeral pomp for Count Peter Mansfelde, who for fourty years had faithfully served the Spaniard in the highest Commands, being then President of Lut∣zenburg, who, though all his life conversant in Warre, had yet by rare fortune lived even to the extremity of old age. And among the Hollanders died Lewis of Nassau, being but a young man, yet emulous of the glory of his Ancestors, and in whom there appeared great hopes of a noble and circumspect Vertue. The Fourteenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1605.THE charges of the now superannuated Warre increasing every year, and that great demonstration of their equal Forces appearing at O∣stend, restored to some that hope which they had a long time laid aside, to wit, that the extreme fury of the Warre would at length conclude in a Peace; hence every one, as their hopes or desires led them, delivered their opinions both in discourses and Books. Such of the Netherlanders as affected the Austrian Government believed, and so said, having great emulation to the Cities of Holland, and malicious inclinations, that they would fall under the weight of that Greatness they had drawn upon themselves, or else would become a prey to forein Princes, unless they returned to their old obe∣dience, whereof for so many ages they had had expe∣rience; onely with these additions to the old Laws: That the Netherlandish Government should not revolve to the Spaniard; That the right of Commerce should be free and indefinite; That Religion should not be forcibly or with punishments urged, in hope of ma∣king a more united Concord; That as well the forein Souldiers, as that plague of mankinde, the Jesuites fa∣ction, should be expelled; That the chief honours should remain in the Citizens, and all affairs of greatest concernment should be handled in the General Coun∣cel
of the Provinces; which liberty would continue more substantial if it were used with moderation. On the other side, some in France persuaded the Nether∣landers to separate themselves from the House of Au∣stria; That the name of Archduke was but a vanity, without power, without authority, his Forces being con∣sumed by the Enemy, his Authority swallowed or de∣voured by the Spaniard: and when the Netherlands should be exhausted and Spain impoverished, what hopes had they of protracting the Warre? certainly, onely this one, the wealth of the Indies, which also in time would fail them, and become a propriety to him that is most prevalent at Sea. That the twenty several Mutinies and Seditions of the Souldiers have made Albertus his Government infamous; and if while those jealousies and hatreds encreased among them the French should have stirred, they might have lain upon the Country and devoured the fields, which of neces∣sity must have produced desolation and poverty. There∣fore they should return and unite themselves to the Body of France voluntarily, and of their own accord, rather then be compelled thereto by force; by which means they should remain setled in the ancient and re∣nowned seat of their Ancestors, which must needs pe∣rish and be lost if the Hollanders should be victorious. That there are nine Forts or Castles erected for a small resistence of all Invaders, from whence the original of that Nation is extracted, of whom 'tis questioned whe∣ther they exceed more in cruelty or pride, but after∣wards inclosed by the Pyrenean Mountains, and the re∣mote shore of their own Ocean. That the French Em∣pire, grown to a vast magnitude, would govern its Sub∣jects with more moderation, and for the future settle Peace by a settled and hereditary succession, according
to the Salick Law: That this should be to them no loss, because they should enjoy in common all the ad∣vantages and benefits of France. Some there were also in Germany who equally considered from hence the Spanish greatness, on the other side the abstruse re∣cesses of the Hollanders, whose fortune was daily bet∣tered by Warre; nor could they be concluded by con∣quering. That it were both more honourable and easie for the Spaniard to repel the Turk with those Arms he useth against these; or else he might compensate any small damage of his Government by propagating and encreasing his limits elsewhere. That the Hollanders might buy their Liberty for money: for Empires have their setled foundations and periods, so that when they are arrived to the highest pitch of Greatness, they sud∣denly decrease. Of late the Spaniards neither deman∣ded Tunis nor Goleta, nor did the Austrian Family look after Switzerland. So also must he loose these people; and as they chiefly withdraw themselves, so were they to be suspected from the remembrance of the Warre, and by the discord of Religion, working great preju∣dice even from their example: besides, part of them were purchased from the Burgundians, so that he may with equal justice sell what he had bought. These were the discourses abroad: but at home, besides a few in whose hands lay the managery of the Com∣monwealth, and by whom all counsels and advices were ordered, the rest, calling to minde how great the Spaniard's pride was, how resolutely determined never to agree with the Hollanders, threw aside all hopes, the Fates having yet kept in obscurity any glimmering of an end of this so great and long a Warre.
And now the States, to Maximilian Cocheyne ur∣ging the Emperour's commands, as also to the Legates of Mentz, Saxony and others desiring safe conduct, free passage, and time and place for a Treaty, being all things of moment, and such as usually work with the common people, returned this Answer. That they were not unmindful what damages they had received by former Treaties: Nor were Germany or the Emperour, although names highly reverenced by them, of any power against the treacherous dealings of their Enemies. That the Hollanders were desirous of no∣thing more then that, the fear of Warre being laid aside, they might enjoy what they had attained with so many dangers, and so persevering an industry; and therefore ha∣ving so long intreated the aid of their neighbours, to di∣vert the Arms imminent over them by a moderate Peace, and having afterwards gotten to themselves a solid and well-setled liberty from a fatal necessity, which was al∣lowed and confirmed by Kings and Princes, they would not change it for a deceitful Peace. That they had here∣tofore entred into Covenants with the Netherlandish Lords, and were now ready to renew the same; for it was evidently seen how small the authority of the Arch∣dukes was, since Spinola a Foreiner received his Com∣mand over the Netherlands by Commission from Spain, They never refused a safe and well-grounded Peace, so as Religion might be safe, and the Commonwealth not hazarded: But if that opinion remained, that as there ought to be but one Pope for the ruling Ecclesiastical af∣fairs, so for the Government of Temporal matters there should be but one King, and that the Monarch of Spain; Germany should see that the Hollanders would not be wanting either to their own or the publick safety. As to
the business spoken of concerning damages done by them, they would endeavour that their Justice and Equity should not be blamed. That they should be reputed very rash and inconsiderate, if they should deliver up any strong Holds while Spinola lay about the Rhine: they knew Ger∣many it self might thus be forewarned; if they would consider Mendosa's Army, and the contumelious injuries received by them. About this time came forth a Book written by Fran∣cis Renes, a learned man and of good repute in the Com∣monwealth, of which he had deserved well for writing the Annals thereof in the native Language: this man, the Author, being dead, the Book was set forth and pub∣lished by his friends; discoursing of many things as well ancient as novel, and relating the many tyran∣nies and oppressions of the House of Austria and the Spaniards, and what treacherous Leagues those Prin∣ces used towards other people, especially those whom the Pope absolved by a Religious kinde of perjury; and setting forth that from thence the danger was equal both to the Catholicks and Reformed people; and that there was no other issue to be expected then by Conquest, since those waies which are absolutely desperate to men are yet evident and well known to God. While these things were minded discursively, the Warre in the mean time is spurred on in good earnest. For those Forces that had been taken up at Ostend made a great accession of strength to the Hollanders, be∣sides some Regiments came out of France to their aid, the King sending them advice that they should first draw out into the Field, for it would be more for their advantage to be before-hand with the Enemy,
then to let him get the start of them. But in Eng∣land and Germany Forces were levied and raised for both parties with a vendible faith, as they met Soul∣diers of Fortune, or else as Religion led any man to one side or the other. Also the Hollanders hasted to raise money with all speed; but the Netherlanders under the Archduke came to it with less willingness and more delay, for that the Warre was maintained against their will, and they were jealous of the ill managing of the Treasury: besides, the United States had increased their displeasure, by writing to the Nobles of affairs that concerned the common good; which things so terrified Albertus, that he would not suffer a meet∣ing of the Provinces under him, though often before and at that time chiefly the same was desired, fearing lest by his denial of many things he should become unable to resist their envy, or the authority of the States being contemned, they should, according to their neighbour example, fall to direct force; his Letters to his friends detecting this his fear, which the Hol∣landers intercepting sent to the Netherlandish Nobles. Therefore Albertus, notwithstanding the waving of his consent, permitted the Provinces severally to meet, cherishing those that were discontented in minde with the hope of money from the Indies, which the weal∣thy and successful Spanish Fleet had brought, or else of an approaching Peace, if the Warre were more ea∣gerly followed for a little time. The beginning of the year among the Spaniards was spent in idleness and repose among the sweets and blandishments of mirth, while Don Ambrosio Spinola, having now the whole command of the Warre, (he was but newly come from Spain, where he had con∣sulted with the King concerning the method of ma∣naging
thereof) had likewise bestowed on him the honour of the Golden Fleece, and before the King of Great Britain's Embassadour was sworn to the peace with Albertus. Now also was the settlement of the Kingdome of Spain upon the Male issue celebrated with pompous Shews and publick Prayers and Thanks∣givings. At the height of the Spring, and not before, Prince Maurice having gathered together his Forces, by the direction of the States he undertakes a great work; for he went to Antwerp, of old the most flourishing City of all the Netherlands, and now, the general Trade being gone to the Hollanders, retaining their formerly-gotten wealth and renown. A great hope of glory in∣cited him to the gaining thereof; for about twenty years before, in the Duke of Parma's time, while the Affairs of the Union were wholly unsetled, by a long and difficult Siege, scarcely grown into a full success, yet such was the Victor's vainglorious ostentation, as made the World believe that in that one City he had gained the possession of the whole Netherlands. It was serious and considerate advice, to shut up this large and spacious City with small Forces, by overflowing all the adjacent plain Fields with the River Scheld, and pitching their Camps on the higher ground; but there appeared no sufficient reason of seising the opposite bank of the River on the edge of Flanders. Some ad∣vised to send Souldiers through the Country by night-marches out of Cazant: but Prince Maurice himself chose rather to goe by Ship; which while it was pre∣paring with great endevour, as fortuned, the Enemy immediately grew jealous, and gave out in speeches that Antwerp should be attempted. This News was received with various affections of the Townsmen:
part of them rejoycing, as if their Liberty was draw∣ing nigh; others, imagining a scarcity would follow, presently began to inhance the price of Victuals; and many, gathering together their wealth and riches, thought to betake themselves to flight. But Spinola sending thither some Horse encouraged such as were afraid, the same Horse behaving themselves modestly, and without injury of the Citizens: then viewed all the coast of Flanders, which situate over against Ant∣werp is called Waesenland, and left there three thousand foot-Souldiers in Guard, that were to wait upon the Enemie's motion; for he was not ignorant that the Enemy could not possess the River, unless by drow∣ning the Fields and placing Guards he made that coast also his own. Wherefore, chusing a particular day, Prince Maurice with a strong Party went to Bergen op Zoom, and Count Ernest of Nassau bringing the rest of the Souldiers in the Fleet out of Zeland came into the Scheld, and first of all passing with good success all the Hollanders Forts, when he came near Ant∣werp among the Enemie's Sconces, although in the night, he could not pass unseen, but was forced to as∣sail the Flandrian banks through all the Enemie's Shot; but they which kept Guard in those parts be∣ing stirred up by the noise of the bullets, and co∣vered by the interposition of the banks, following the fails, Count Ernest, the wind beating back the Ships into Brabant, was hindred to come and joyn his For∣ces where he was commanded, being otherwise enga∣ged to fight at disadvantage with a resolute and well-provided Enemy. However, to try his fortune, in small boats he transports almost four hundred men, that were easily routed by the first shock of the Ene∣my, and other part of them were taken; Colonel
Dorpen, by the violent pursuit of the Enemy, leaping armed into the River, escaped one danger with ano∣ther. Count Ernest being driven back into Brabant, Prince Maurice, disappointed of his design, compells the Castle of Woude, situate not farre from Berck, within five daies to surrender; which was too mean a prize for so great an Army to look after, and too small a reward for them that had before them so great hopes: yet some satisfaction it yielded, for from thence the Enemy infested the Rivers with Pi∣racies. But these great threats happened not onely to be in vain, but to fall out quite contrary, so that the Hol∣landers had not of a long time a more unfortunate year. While Prince Maurice staid at Woude, Spinola, though at that time the Court there was full of mirth concerning the English Embassadour, was not slow to take into his thoughts more serious affairs among those pleasant diversions, but made a Bridge over the Scheld, that went towards the Enemy which way so∣ever he should turn, by which means he was ready to pursue; and therefore was the more severe to those that surrendred Woude, as guilty of an over-hasty and cowardly fear, so that he punished some of them with death. Nor did the United States a little wa∣ver and grow afraid at the report of these great For∣ces approaching with Spinola, not resolved whether they had best assault or defend; but the Prince per∣suaded to remain about Rhine, lest the Enemy that way should invade the undefended parts of their Do∣minion. And his opinion prevailing, command was given to goe into Flanders and to call a Councel at Scluys. And now they thought fit to besiege the t'Zas not farre from Gaunt, where the waters run∣ning
from thence fall into the Hont, and so into the Sea: which if they brought to pass with good suc∣cess, they threatned some Cities; but if not, yet they would retain there Spinola's strength threatning the cruelty of a grievous Warre to other places. Not farre from Ysendike Prince Maurice sate down with his Army which he had brought by Ship to Wa∣terfleet, whom Spinola, sending some part of his For∣ces before, immediately follows; and at a place cal∣led Bucholt, which was between him and the t'Zas, settles himself, as a fit place either to oversee or re∣press the Enemie's endevours. Thus they remained a great while in view of each other, without any thing done by either, save a few light skirmishes of the Horse. One time Pompeio Justiniano by Spinola's command entred the marishes, in hope to have bur∣ned the Sutlers Boats, which lay hard by Prince Mau∣rice's Camp; but being espied by the Sentinels he was soon met and repulsed. In that Region over against Walcheren lies the Fort Patientia, in the assault whereof Prince Maurice intended to drive away idleness: but Spinola took a little Fort that lay in the middle of the way, and joyned it to his Camp with a continued Breastwork: but Prince Maurice's Camp lying in a wet and unwholesome soil, what with diseases, and what with runnings away, was almost emptied. But Fortune recompenced at Sea this slow and protracted Warre at Land; from whence, since the first Com∣motions of the Hollanders until these very times that which was reckoned among the great burthens of the Spaniard, (to wit, that his best and choicest Souldiers must of necessity be brought afarre off out of Italy by long Marches into the Netherlands, being in the interim of no use, though they were an extraordinary
charge and burthen) was now eased by Spinola; for he brought by Sea out of Spain it self into the Ports of Flanders what Forces he had occasion for. Twelve hundred Souldiers, trained up in the Irish Warres by Colonel Pedro Sarmienti, were at Lisbone put aboard eight Ships and some little Barks, the charge of all which was given to Pedro Cumiara, whose particular instruction among others was this, That if he could not get in at Flanders, avoiding the coast of France, he should goe to the British shore, where by the help of the Spanish Embassadour they might have safe har∣bour; and that he should there receive such of the Britans as he had hired and purchased by gifts. But the United States, that they might for the future restrain the like bold attempts by terrour, did com∣mand William Hauteene Admiral of Zeland to meet the Spaniards in the narrow Sea towards Bulloyn, and without any pity to drown all the Prisoners they took in the Sea. Now it is to be observed that the Spaniards were not brought in Ships of Warre, but of burthen, such as could with most ease lurk upon ei∣ther the British or German coasts. But Hauteene with part of his Fleet coasting about Flanders, and with the residue going along the shores of Britain, by this means met with whatever passed in the middle of the Chanel. Thus passing along at last he met his Enemies about Dover; who when they would not strike sail, but voluntarily stood in their own defence by shooting, part of them were slain, the rest escaped either by swimming, or the help of English Boats which came in to their succour and took them up. Another Ship, coming even into the harbor, was so beset with two Ships of Zeland, that at last they all struck upon the Flats and Quicksands: but the Ze∣landers
as they were less in bulk, so more light to avoid and escape a danger, not onely assaulted, but took and brought off the Enemie's Vessel. The Mari∣ners, according to command, were thrown into the Sea: the Souldiers and such as had long been in ser∣vice much complaining of Fortune, not that she de∣prived them of their lives, which they knew was but short at the best, and whereof they could not in regard of their age hope the long continuance; but that they, being a people sworn to fight, should not die vali∣antly as Souldiers with their swords in their hands, but should be helplessly swallowed up in the all-de∣vouring waves of the Sea. The next day some more Ships were taken, and one burned, all the Souldiers suffering the like severe fate, being tied two together, which upon a sign given were all at once thrown over∣board. One saying he had no need of the Enemie's hands to hasten on his death, voluntarily leaped into the Sea, who though he was unknown among all that obscure company, yet was covetous of honor even to his last. This slaughter consumed almost the one half of the men and Ships; for four of them by the help of the wind got into the Haven, yet were many of the men there wounded and slain even by the Enemie's shot. But the Souldiers in Dover, while these Enemies fought at Sea, a great while looking on, at last grew angry to have the War brought into their Jurisdiction, and shot from the Castle in aid of their late Enemies against their old Friends. The Britans recriminating the Hollanders for these attempts, were afterwards answered, that they did not seek for any Ships in the Rivers of England, which yet the Dun∣kerkers without any notice taken thereof had done, but they looked rather at their Enemy growing hot
by the force of Victory, then either the confines or boundaries of Sea and Land. But they could not so easily purge themselves, because under pretence of searching the English who contrary to the King's Proclamation made War at Sea, they had not long since drawn to their shore the Spanish Ships, which were take as a prey by the Hollanders, and vindicating King Philip's Embassadour, had under pretence of right eluded the force of War. But the Spaniards that lately were driven thither by the desperate storms of the Sea before Winter, remained there at great charge, which was very grievous to their Masters; and in the interim, while in a miserable condition they continued on the bare shore in poor little cottages by them erected, either lived in great poverty, or died languishing: for not a few of them died of sickness and wounds, among whom was Cumiara himself. Now arrived out of Italy six strong Regiments by their usual way of marching by Land, besides new levies made by the Archduke in the neighbour King∣domes: nor otherwise came the parties to so great strength: for Spinola when he was in Spain with the King, replete with the honor and authority of taking Ostend, had easily persuaded him, that this lingring War, advantageous to the Enemy, might easily have an end set thereto, if the King would contract his long-continued gifts; and to this purpose he gave for his word, and inscribed on all his Ensigns this Motto, Jam aut nunquam, Now or never. Wherefore cal∣ling to mind the frequent mischiefs that had arisen by Sedition, he required money and two Armies; with the one of which he would defend his own limits, and with the other would invade Frieseland; and to that purpose
provided all things necessary in plenty: for the Tributes beyond the Rhine being gotten by them would be a great damage to the Enemy; besides, many Cities now possessed by the Enemy, which at present the Rivers defended, would become a new bound, and there would be need of a strong Army to scatter the Garri∣sons. And this with the greater hope was to be under∣taken, in regard from thence the very entrails of the Hollanders would lie open to them both by Sea and Land. This was wise counsel, as the first successes made it seem; but the rest being not fol∣lowed according to hope, I will proceed to re∣member. The Generals yet remaining in Flanders, while the Prince at Scluys took care to fortify Ysendike, and Spinola attempted him with false alarms, Count Bucquoy having with a strong party not far from Colen driven the Hollanders Ships out of the Rhine, (for he had carried with him great Guns) passed the River, to the great terror of the German Cities round about, from whose remembrance the Villanies of Mendosa's time, and the many indignities they had suffered, were not yet banished. At the mustring of the forces, the Pope's Legate was present, solemnly praying that their Arms might be victorious, and encouraging them to goe on chearfully, and be deliverers to such as were orthodox, but to take vengeance on the rest; That it was not so much their Prince's as God's cause they maintained, whose Altars and Temples being defiled and sacrilegiously converted to other uses, he would they should be restored by their hands. When they were come to Keysersweert, (where some of old supposed a Trojane Colony remained) they
begin to erect a Fort on both banks of the River, to secure the passage. The Bridge that lay over the Rhine was made at Colen, whence also great store of Victualls was brought as long as the Spanish affairs were in a thriving condition, the Senate of that City publickly therein manifesting their affection. Which things being heard by Prince Maurice, conjecturing from his own and Mendosa's former practices, that no man would goe into his Enemie's country that way and leave Berck behind him, thereupon he sent his Brother Henry and Count Ernest with four thousand foot and two thousand horse, to whom the States added Deputies from their own Assembly. Nor did they delay to make it their first care to strengthen Berck, taking into their Works (which they made exceeding strong) a great space of ground without the Town, whereby the greater delay might be put upon the Enemy, and the Garrison have the better room. Within these they kept the Souldiers, although Over-Issell and the Cities of Frieseland, and Lingen especially, required fresh sup∣plies of Souldiers, and what other things are necessary in Warre. But the care of the Publick here was omit∣ted by private fear; but at length five companies were sent to Lingen. In the mean while the Nas∣savian horse twice met the Enemy and beat him. And while the Summer was yet in its prime, the Marquess Spinola, leaving in Flanders Frederick Count Heremberg, (who had the command of six thousand foot and five hundred horse) himself hasted to Buc∣quoy's men and the rest whom he had sent before; and privately observes Roeroort, a place where the River Roer runs into the Rhine, fit to be fortified; which he doth. Then calling together all his chief Officers, who till this time were ignorant to what use
all these preparations were, he opens his mind to them, and tells them he would first goe to Lingen, the chief Fortress of all those parts, which would easily be taken, if he made haste, because there were but few Souldiers therein, and they unexperienced in Warre. But the chief point of all consisted in this, that they might prevent the Enemie's supplies which were coming to Lingen; and this might be done if they would diligently follow Berck. Groll and other Towns, whose names were unknown to him. He was not ignorant how contrary this was to the con∣stant practice of former Captains, to throw himself into the farthest part of his Enemie's Country, leaving the whole Countrey behind him Hostile; but as matters proceeded, so were counsells to be altered, for no precepts would ever serve at all times, and sometimes more advantage is gotten by daring then by too much wariness. He had now chosen the best time, while their fruit and corn was ripe and not yet carried away; and the Towns on the edge of Westphalia would freely bring in Victualls, if they might be paid for the same. This also he had taken care for. That although it were true that Prince Maurice would come thither, yet it would be a great while first, for he was not provided for a land-march, and he would goe where neither a Fleet nor the usual Rivers could bring him; and at last when he did come, there were the plain fields which would afford room to fight, which was as earnestly desired by his Souldiers, as it would be carefully avoided by the Enemy. As to the Forts taken by Bucquoy, it was debated whe∣ther they should be dismantled, or repaired at their re∣turn and defended. Most were of opinion that it was dangerous to goe into the Territories of others and with
divided forces to break both their strength and reputati∣on. Spinola agreed with the fewer in number, and com∣manded Bucquoy to take up the cool and shady places up∣on the German bank of the Rhine, and for the encrease and keeping his Works he gave him six thousand men, which were chiefly new and raw Souldiers, and not able to undergoe a hard march. By this shew of an Army, the care for Berck taken by the Hollanders was a vain, and hindred them from sending their forces to prevent real dangers, for fear lest the journey into Frieseland being but pretended, Spinola, when the Souldiers were drawn away, should rather draw  his strength thither. He conceived nine thousand foot and about two thousand horse were enoUgh to goe along with himself, as knowing Prince Maurice's forces were tired, and part thereof were to remain in Flanders, to resist Count Heremberg. The foot marched being divided into three Bodies, to every of which appertained Cannon, to the number of eleven in all. The Flanks were secured by the Carriages, wherein were brought the Victualls, Boats and Bridges for passing of Rivers and Marishes, all which also had their guards: but the Front and Rear was defended by the Horse. Spinola himself went in the Van, sending before him Scouts and Pioneers to search the ways and level them: where the country grew more Champain, for hastning the journey the first and middle Battel proceeded on together, the ranks of the Carriages being doubled; and in the stead of a Trench were Night-watches, which were defended by great Guns and troups of horse. In the day-time the middle-ward succeeded the Van, and the Rear the middle-ward in certain turns. And hen was it found by a great experiment, that vices however having gotten to a head, yet are easily brought
into order and reformed, if there be but a persevering care: for the General quickly restored that Discipline which for a long time had been corrupted by Sedition and licenciousness; because as he was carefull in giving the Souldiers their pay, and bountifull in rewarding every good action they did, so he was inexorable to offenders, and would not be observant to any ones humor; Not onely thefts and rapines, but without leave to depart from their Colours was a capital offence, the Provost-marshall riding about, and with him the Hangman with a halter: by which means, and the hanging of some few for small faults in the sight of the Army, he cured all the rest. Philip Croy Count Solre was sent to the next Cities of Germany, by taking away from them fear, to purchase favour: for they did not as heretofore run on violently with disobedience and fury, for their Officers were with them to keep them in awe, and the Souldiers themselves were accustomed to obey, and such as could distinguish between Peace and War▪ they were neither oppressive nor burthen∣some to the Towns or Country, all they desired was but Victualls at a reasonable rate, and that they might have a free passage through the Country. Nor did their actions in ought differ from their words; so that all kinds of provisions were plentifully brought to them, and they gained from their neighbors not onely praise but thanks, comparing their old injuries with the present security they enjoied. Beyond the Rivers Roer and Luppe (although some Holland horse∣men were sent to cut the Bridge over Luppe, but they came too late) the fourth day they came to Oldenzul, a Town in Over-Yssel, boasting the Fortification of former times, and not at all changed from what it was seven years before when Prince Maurice took it.
The Enemy thought he might have taken it in his passage; yet although they made very great hast, the Garrison being timely increased, frequent sallies were made thence, so that they put the Enemy in fear not onely of his passage but of the want of provisions. Within the Town were almost four hundred men, part horse, the rest foot. The horse issued out first, and afterward the foot, doing good exercution upon all they met with at first; but the approaching Army was too strong for their small number, and, notwith∣standing all their shot, in one night in three places came up to the very Town-ditch; but yet Spinola not surrounding the Town, with the death and wounding of a few men, he redeemed the time, which is a chief point of War: contrary to which rule Prince Maurice acts, whose custome is to follow on safely, though with less speed. In the Morning, upon a small Battery made by those Guns he brought with him, the Town was delivered: When understanding by some priso∣ners the state of Lingen, and that more Souldiers were daily expected thither, commanding the horse to goe before, himself the next day pitched his Tents before the Town. This Lingen being fit for a frontier Town, Prince Maurice, out of affection thereto, because it was given to him, had begun to fortifie at his own charge and with his best skill, surrounding both the Town and Castle with a very deep and broad Ditch and six strong Bulwarks and Mounts. But the work being new and in part unperfect, and the Rampier not well setled, was the more easy for the assailants to win. There was in the Town an indifferent number of Souldiers, about six hundred, but such as neither durst make a sally nor fight at the line, besides their Commanders were altogether unskilfull and infinitely
timorous, nor had any one knowledge how to plant or level a Cannon. Therefore while the great guns were preparing and the place viewed, the Enemy without any hindrance or loss, helped by the Meanders of the Gardens, sooner then was credible almost came to the brink of the Trench: And now four several nations, from so many distinct places, hastned to pass over, each of them in emulation and forwardness striving to outvie the other. Part of them, by drawing the small Brooks in the old chanel of the little River, strove to deprive them of water: others brought the Bridge and placed it upon Vessells, or else bound together Faggots and Osiers, according to the in∣vention first found out at Ostend; which made them so secure, that some of them went unarmed even into the Trench, and there promoted the work. It was now the ninth day of the siege, and the Walloons had taken the Bulwark opposite to them; the Italians, Spaniards and Germans were partly imploied about the middle Trench, and part of them nearer. The Governour of the Town, Colonel Martin Cobbe, being broken with old age and feeble in going, calls all his Captains to counsel, and shewing to them be∣sides other inconveniences the great want of Ball, asked them what was fit to be done. They had no mind to raise new works, or repair those that were battered, to oppose their bodies to the Enemies shot, or so much as defend the Castle: but they rather admire, that in all that time the Enemy had not summoned the Town: but others said that custome was grown out of date, being used neither at Ostend nor Scluys. The Governor, as if this had been valiant advice, admonished them to defer articling till the Evening, but if that were too much, at least
not to move it till noon. The rest were troubled hereat, averring nothing of moment could be done within those few hours, and what they demanded in ime would be easily granted. This their resolution they put in execution with as much speed as they had agreed upon it: whereat Spinola rejoyced, whose de∣sires, though he were in great hast, yet were prevented with fear of the Enemy. In the mean while Prince Maurice hastning as much as he could upon the re∣port of this Expedition beyond the Rhine, gives the custody of the Ports in Flanders and the Government of Scluys to Colonel Notte, and taking from thence five and twenty Companies went to Deventer; be∣sides he drew out from about the Rhine ten others, and as many more out of the Garrisons, as also eight that were newly raised in England: but the great Guns were kept back by the cross winds. Two or three days after the surrender of Lingen, the Prince was ready to have raised the Siege, to that purpose having drained the Cities of their Souldiers, when a sorrowfull messenger arrives with the news that the Town was lost; for which not onely the Governor Colonel Cobbe was ere he was aware committed to prison, and there long kept, but also several of the Captains, where they underwent as well the harsh censure of the people as the judgement of their very relations, protesting them unworthy of favor. The heads of their defence, which they sent in Letters to the Captains and the neighbouring Towns, were, that there were not Souldiers enough sent to them, or other things either for the defence or freeing of the Town; and that the Townsmen, though exceeding them in number, yet denying to watch and ward or doe any duty, had compelled them by threats and
prayers to prevent imminent ruine by a timely agree∣ment and composition. At length, when time had mitigated the envy of the fact, they, were degraded, without any farther punishment. During this Siege, Thomas Filler, one of them who from the Hochstraten Sedition remained with the Hol∣landers, being a couragious person and one that would dare any thing to get booty, fell upon the Count Solre's quarters, and of a hundred horsemen given him for a guard took thirty, and slew among the rest the Baron Ciacci, Don Richardot's son-in-law: the Count himself was wounded, and with much a doe got away. But the United States, if perchance Spinola's Camp had been afflicted with want of Provisions, by publick Edict commanded, that none should carry any Victualls into his Army, and whosoever should, be found so doing, should be reputed as Enemies: Yet for all this there wanted no provision, now out of hope of gain, anon by the terror of victory; inso∣much that some carried home from the Camp what they brought thither to sell, it being so much more then could be spent. Spinola staied a while at Lingen, and there, as if amazed at so good fortune, he admi∣red the strength and rare structure of the Works, and yet for their defence he raised other Works beyond the Trench. Which late design coming to the knowledge of Prince Maurice, he followed thither, as if he had intended a present siege. But if he had chosen rather to get more then to keep what he had gotten, the same force and the fresh report of his approach had brought an equal terror upon all places. There were but few Souldiers either at Coevoerden or the Fort in Bourtange, through which places the Enemy must come into Frieseland: besides Groeningen
trembled, and Embden, though farre off, yet ignorant a matters of War, was tired with private discords; which Count Enno, being confident in this Warre of the States affairs, increased. And now the Enemy lying still awhile, Prince Maurice had some vacant time for his Pioneers to strengthen and repair the fortifications of the Garrisons in Frieseland and be∣yond the Rhine: Himself with Count William of Nassau having gathered together, nine thousand men, be marched to Coevoerden, for defence of the interior parts, and that he might be the nearer to follow the Enemy in the very track, adding to that place several new Bulwarks. Among all these publick actions some private and clandestine Stratagems also were used, whereof one Terral a French fugitive was the inventor. This man having tendred his service to the Hollan∣ders and being refused, because he seemed to ask too great honors and rewards, went over to the Spaniard: he was of a confident spirit, and rarely skilled in all Fire-works and other devices made with Gun∣powder. To this man the Archduke, out of the supernumerary Souldiers in other places, assigned fifteen hundred foot and three hundred horse under the command, of Colonel Torricurte the Governor of Hulst, in hopes therewith to have surprised Bergen op Zoom. These, in the night at the ebbe of the Sea, through the marishes got into the Haven, and possessed two Forts, the one that defended the Haven, the other the Gate, the Souldiers that kept them flying away. And if they had proceeded forward from the Haven, the City would have been indangered, both the Souldiers and Townsmen being unprovided, and so in the greater confusion. But they went to the Water-gate, and there with their Engines throwing
down two Sluces that lay between them and the Town, the Petard that they hung at the Gate, having in the march caught wet, did no execution; no more did the Hand-granadoes, because they were moistned with the dirt, Thus being frustrated of their hopes, and the tide of Floud increasing, they hastned their return, deserting all the places they had gotten: and now the multitude of defendants being come together, they not onely shot with bullets, but from above threw down upon them great stones, wherewith thirty were killed and many hurt. Yet did not this unfor∣tunate event so terrify them, but that a moneth after they attempted the same thing again with greater courage and more, force: when the contest was more sharp, because their coming being foreknown by some Scouts, all things within were prepared ready to receive them. The Enemy, knowing nothing of their intelligence in the Town, came on. A little after midnight, the weather wet and clowdy, and by that means exceeding dark, the signe being given, they as∣saulted three places at once, in two of which they had placed Bridges by reason of the water; and al∣though they were not long enough, yet many scram∣bling with their hands and feet got to the Rampier, to the top of which they were no sooner gotten, but they were immediately beaten down again: for the Gover∣nor of the Town, Colonel Paul Baxen, mingling the Townsmen and Souldiers together, had manned all the Works round about the Town, himself riding from place to place, and keeping in the Market-place two Companies to be assisting in any place in case of necessity. But on that side the Town towards Steen∣bergen, it seemed rather to be downright force then any nocturnal Policy: for the Townsmen setting
fire on straw and pitched barrells, made so great a light, that they could see plainly all that the Enemy did. There with Gunpowder they had beaten down two Gates and a Draw-Bridge, insomuch that the Enemies beat up their Drums even within the Town-walls; in like manner the horse sounded their Trumpets, as if at that very instant they had been entring. There was one Sluce yet remaining, which the Townsmen had stopped up with Carts and other great pieces of Timber: this, in regard many of Terrall's workmen were killed and spoiled in the former places, they endeavored to cut into pieces with their Swords and with Axes: But the Townsmen seeing the approching Enemy, threw down fire upon them from the walls, and with their Muskets and great Guns not onely gave them cer∣tain wounds but reproachfull language, so that at last the Souldiers refused to be led to the slaughter by their Officers. There was no slothfull person in the City at this time, both the Magistrates and Mi∣nisters putting on Arms, and by their presence giving others not onely exhortations, but example: nay the very Citizens that were of the Roman Religion, if any such were, knowing that a Victory gained in the darkness of the night and height of fury would make no difference of persons, acted with great resolution, lest they should seem to disunite themselves from the common cause: the very Wo∣men did not spare any pains or labour in bringing Calthrops, Bullets, Pitch and Stones in their childrens cradles. (having first emptied them of all things else) and then in the more retired and soft places, upon their bended knees, with eyes and hands lifted up to Heaven, they beseeched God to assist the Defendants,
and to turn the evil of those cruel designs upon the authors thereof. After day was broken, the re∣sidue of them returned to Antwerp. In the Town there was onely one killed, and very few wounded, for they were well saved by the height of their de∣fences. In like manner also Grobbendonck attempted to assault Grave by night with Bridges and scaling-Ladders; but understanding that the Townsmen prepared to re∣ceive him, he desisted. And now Spinola had for∣tified Lingen, unresolved what to doe the remaining part, of the year, the Autumn being now beginning. To refresh his Souldiers in Germany would be in∣famous and base: The Spies that were sent to Berck returned, and brought intelligence that the Works were very great and hard to be overcome. At length, leaving Garrisons both at Lingen and Oldenziel, often∣times removing his Camp, he sate down before Roeroort, and making there a Bridge, he erected a Fort on each side of the Rhine, the Germans desiring that at Keysersweert might be pulled down. But Roeroort being a Town in the jurisdiction of Moers, in the Enemie's Country, and better situated, upon consultation had about the same, it was thought that removal was advantageous. At this time a new Regiment came out of Italy into the Netherlands, and another, consisting of part English, part Scots, and some Irish, but all Catholicks. These unobserved of the Hollunders passed the Sea to aid the Spaniard, Britain also rejoycing to be rid of them. With this strength, and what other supplies Spinola added out of his own Army, Bucquoy was sent to besiege Wachtendonck But Prince Maurice fearing some treachery attended the Enemie's motion,
and kept hard by Yssel, lest he should carry the War thither. When he saw Spinola setled, he also pitched his Camp a little lower not far from the Town of Wesel: Nor did he suppose he had at any time a fairer opportunity to dare the Enemy, or make some attempt upon him, then while one part of the Enemy was in Flanders, another about Wachtendonck: and to this end he resolved first to fall upon Spinola's horse and some Regiments that quartered about and in Mullem; and if his success there answered his desire, then he determined to invade the rest of the Army; hoping this laudable advice would in one day yield him a great Victory, unless God thought fit to repell the long-continued prosperity of the Hollanders, and the honor they had attained in the War, by un∣fortunate and adverse successes: for I cannot with reason ascribe their so fatal a fear to any other cause. The Village of Mullem lies close by the River Roer, which, although it be broad, yet is fordable in many places: onely it was not passable for horse, because the banks lay so high, except they were levelled by main strength. On the contrary bank was situate the Castle of Burick, and all round about were the Fields that lay somewhat higher. The Prince made haste with his horse, carrying over some foot Regi∣ments in Carts: with part of the Troups he comman∣ded his brother to goe before, and likewise by an∣other way with another party Colonel Marcellus Baxen; this to goe towards Roer, against the Castle of Burick, to shut up all passages of flight from them being circumvented; that by a narrow passage a∣mong the Enemies, whose inclosures were by chance open, as not kept by the Enemy, through the Souldier's
neglect to whom the charge thereof was committed, that afterwards expiated his fault with his head. Herein was a great Error, that Count Henry of Nas∣sau's horse did not presently come to the Village of Mullem, but he staied for the coming up of the foot, hoping to find the Enemies scattered elsewhere; who in the interim gathered together at the River, and the higher and more open places that were beyond it. And this onely thing made the Hollanders afraid that they found not the Enemy unprovided, as they hoped, but without doubt stronger then themselves: hereupon their courages being altogether abated, they betook themselves to an unworthy flight, no body pursuing them. Scarce could the sight of Prince Maurice himself and the rest of the Regiments re∣strain them from running over their very fellow-Souldiers, nay the General himself, so much were they affrighted. In the mean while Baxen breaking into the out-parts of the Castle of Burick (the inner parts were held onely by ten Souldiers) met with some Troups of the Enemy, which by chance were going out to forage: But he being not affrighted therewith, and moving forward, drove them back; and questionless they had fled, but that both horse and foot coming from Mullem restrained them: and then the Prince's men overpressed with number and wearied with long fight, were afresh encouraged by the sight of Prince Henry, whom a few men re∣covered from flight followed; some others also being reclaimed by mere shame. Therefore on both sides they set upon the horse and horsemen intangled in the River: but Lewis Velasco hearing of the danger of his men, speeding with some Troups out of Spinola's Camp, reduced the Prince's men into a new fear,
their courages and countenances yet bearing in them the terror of their former flight. Thus once more brought into an amaze, they fled absolutely, nor could Prince Maurice standing publickly on the other bank withdraw them with all his Forces and great Guns, intermingling exhortations and reproof: now he remembred them of the honor they had for∣merly gotten, That they should not be the first to fully the Victories gained at Tornhout and in Flanders, nor lose those merited praises they had won in taking so much from the Enemy, and that had made them renowned in so many fights; That they should not leave his brother, their Leader, in the midst of his Enemies: Then calling upon the fear∣full Souldiers, that trusted rather to the swiftness of their horses heels then the valor of their own hands, Would they onely be diligent in sorrage, and actively oppressive to unarmed people? Then requesting them to stand and face about, Where are those counte∣nances, where are those couragious inquisitions so often by you made to fight the Enemy? acquit your selves of this dishonor offered to your Country and to Me: Be conquered rather when I am absent, but rather purge your selves of this crime by some wor∣thy act, that I may hereafter see you otherwise be∣have your selves with valour in other things. But all these things prevailed nothing, their minds being so fully possessed with fear. Count Henry of Nas∣sau, onely accompanied with a few of his domestick train, as he was retreating to Baxen, being eminent for his habit, was on all hands furiously followed; and the Captain of a Troup of the Enemies riding near, that he might not discharge his Carabine, being in great fear of a Pistol levelled against him, by and
by laid hold of the Scarf he wore upon his shoulders, which the great Officers of horse wear for shew, but is of great danger in the wearing; yet at the in∣stant was redeemed. Which was an act of high merit, whoever did it, which till this time is que∣stioned; though the memory thereof be yet fresh. But Prince Maurice, not so sollicitous now for the Victory as the safety of his Army, lest the begun terror should consternate all, sends part of the re∣maining Regiments over the River: And first of all Sir Horace Vere with the English foot beat back the Enemie's horse, compelled to draw his men into the forme of a wedge, and to fight at push of Pike. O∣merville, the Colonel of the French, followed next, who there honourably lost his life. Nor did the foot Regiments sustain onely the brunt of the horse, but some of them, following the example of the horse, beat back many of the Enemies who fled into the Castle of Burick. And now Fortune was come about: But Spinola eluded them a while by a noble policy, beating up his Drums hard by, as if his whole Army had been drawing near, which were indeed far enough distant. Then the Prince, doubting that this false fear might prove true, as formerly he chiefly relied upon the valor of his horse, so now in their cowardly running away reckoning the greatest incertainty of the War, founded the retreat, placing his Muskettiers on the inner bank, and drawing his horse within safeguard of them. Of the Enemy was slain Colonel Trivulci, an excellent Souldier and a good Captain. The slaughter, wounds, prisoners and Ensigns taken on both sides were equal, onely with this equality the assailants reaped the most dishonor. Spinela, having escaped this danger, for
the future went more prudently to work, contracting his forces into a narrower compass: Then going to see how affairs were managed by Bucquoy, and finding all things to his satisfaction, he returned to Roeroort. Bucquoy had the advantage of a dry Autumn, other∣wise the soil would have been very wet. But the be∣sieged, though they were twelve hundred, commanded by Richoven the Governor, and trusting in their mul∣titude and the strength of their Works promised mighty matters, yet never came out of their works, or endea∣voured to delay the Enemy by any sallies, so that making a Bridge over the River Niers, and the eighth day getting to the Town-ditch, they drew away the water, by beating down the Sluce that kept it in. Being come to the great Bulwarks, first terrifying the be∣sieged with Mines, and after that by an assault, the twentieth day Wachtendonck was delivered. During this time Geldre was attempted by the Prince, but with as little success as the rest, which Town was distant from the Camp four leagues, whither going in the night, he drew his horse and part of his foot, some going before that should make way for them by forcing the Gates with Gunpowder: but when they came to the Draw-bridge, the force of their instrument was too weak, and another being set to, fell into the trench, which gave the Townsmen time to draw together, who soon dispersed those that were near at hand with their shot, among whom was Philip, the son of Philip Morney, Lord du Plessis, being fearless of danger out of the earnestness of his desire to learn; he was the worthy offspring of so worthy a Father, whom he followed in the very track, who in his time was famous in a high measure as well for his noble and heroick actions as Learning.
Nor did Spinola omit farther to prosecute the good fortune of this year; for sending Bucquoy, he easily took the Castle of Cracow in the jurisdiction of Moers: for the truth is, it wanted the main part of its strength, the marshy soil being by the extraordinary drought of the weather void of water. But in Flanders Fre∣derick Count Heremberg erected a great Fort hard by Scluys, where the two Rivers, known by the diversities of their salt and fresh waters, fall into the Haven. This he did assisted by fraud, and a small party of the Enemies in those parts; because they of Bruges pretending to make a Bank as it were for the recovering of the ground, which by an Inundation was torn from humane use, had desired leave to doe the same from those of Scluys. At the end of Autumn, which was very showry, Spinola, seeing the Fortifications about Roeroort were perfected, first dismissed his Army: The same did Prince Maurice soon after, and the horse returning to their winter-quar∣ters, meeting in the way Grobbendouck's Troups, routed the same, carrying the greatest part of them away pri∣soners, being now resolute to lay hold on all occasions whereby they might abolish the memory not of their fight, but of their flight at Mullem. Nor was there any thing more done at Land; but at Sea the reliques of Sarmienti's men by stealth getting through the boiste∣rous Sea, while the wind had driven the Hollanders otherwhere, arrived in Flanders. Soon after this one Lambert of Roterdam, a Sea-Captain, setting upon one of the greatest of the Dunkerkers Ships, that carried one hundred and twenty men, fought with all sorts of shot, and though fewer in number, yet equal in courage, he would not give place to his Enemies fighting for their lives, he himself onely fighting for honor. But when John Gerbrand Governor of Euchuisen brought also his
Ship against the Enemies, the Dunkerkers having lost among the rest their Captain, (who was named Adrian Theodore, and famous for Piracies) and being tempted with the hope of pardon, yield themselves. The Ship that was taken afterwards served for War: about three∣score of the men were hanged, some few got pardon in pity of their youth, some as they were led to punish∣ment escaped and fled, no one offering to stop them; for the long continuance of the miseries in prison had mol∣lified the peoples minds towards them. Among those that returned this year from the Indies, were some that were left by Hemskerk beyond the Cape of Good hope, by reason of a Leak sprung in their Ship. This Ship being driven by the wind to the coast of Madagascar, staid there eight moneths, in great want of all things, and the Sea-men, some by diseases, others by War among the Barbarians, and the rest by grief of mind, were almost all of them consumed, there onely re∣maining alive eighteen of a great number. A like fate drove some other Holland Ships to the same Coasts, which were bound for the Island of Swans: but at their meeting those first poor men, they were even con∣founded between joy and tears; and to hear the nar∣ration of the dangers they had passed, would make any one acknowledge the infinite loving-kindness of God towards them. Presently they began to repair the breaches of other Ships with the fragments of their torn Vessel, and to transpose their Merchandises; by which means at last they returned to their Country, of which they had so long despaired, and the Factors re∣ceived an unexpected gain. Besides two Ships came from Ceilon bringing sad news of the death of the Go∣vernor Sebalde Waert, who was killed by the treachery of the Fimala whom we mentioned elsewhere to be
the King of Candy, and seemingly affectionate to the Hollanders; but his suspicious nature incited him, as is usual with Barbarians, because Sebalde gave liberty to the Portugueses whom he had taken prisoners in War, which he, being a stranger to the customes of the Bar∣barians, doing, it was by them interpreted to be an argu∣ment of collusion between themselves: and he was the rather incensed to believe this, because among the treaties between him and  Barbarian about making War upon the Portugueses, he advised him that he might diligently consider his Ships, and from thence set an estimate upon his strength, urging this with more ear∣nestness then suited with the honor of a Prince. He under pretence of officiousness, pretending his ruine to be sought, to prevent the imagined wickedness, took off Sebalde: and his Associates, for fear of losing their Trade, omitted to revenge the death of their Captain. But the King of Spain fearing lest those far-distant and weak parts of his Empire should become known to all, by a severe Edict forbad any foreiner to sail to the Indies, or any other place under the jurisdiction of Portugal, and they who then were in that other World should by a certain day return thence: which for all that did not so hinder the Hollanders endeavors, but that they sent to the Indies twelve Ships, under the conduct of Captain Matelifen, one of the Governors of the Indian Company. In the interim, Carden, whom we mentioned before to be sent to Brasile, returned with a very great booty. Among the Neighbors, although the name of Peace yet continued, yet many fierce commotions were be∣lieved to tend towards War: for the Citizens of Aquis∣grane, the City having alwaies been coveted by the Dukes of Brabant, had new Governors put upon them,
Imperial Decrees made against them, and (which then was buried in silence, but afterwards was manifested, by the confidence of a private League with Albertus, all) the Ceremonies of the Reformed Religion were both pub∣lickly and privately forbidden; they who had before born the Office of Magistrates were not onely accused as guilty of Sedition, but as being illegally chosen were contumeliously used and fined, their Accusers were of the choicest sort, and whoever undertook their defence were joyned with them in punishment. The Bishop of Colen's Legates, to whom the Emperor had given that in command, under pretext of Reconciliation, publickly declared that profession faulty upon their bended knees, and afterwards laied pecuniary mulcts upon all they denounced guilty, in the name of costs and charges, and upon most the fine exceeded their ability; yet if it were not paid, part were thrown into Prison, others removed their habitations; whose Banishment was followed with care and hatred of the Commons against the Great men, and pity towards the poor. But by how much at the pre∣sent they were oppressed, by so much the more violently they would in the future break out. In France, besides the rest of the Spaniard's treache∣ries, it was discovered, that Monsieur Merarges, sent from Narbon, to exhibite the desires of that Province to the King, had agreed with Don Balthazar Zunica King Philip's Embassador privately for the delivery of Marseilles, concerning which he and one Brunelle, a Ne∣therlander Secretary to the Embassador, were apprehen∣ded, and with them were taken palpable demonstrations of their Treason. When the Embassador required his servant, according to the Law of Nations, the King on the other side set forth the unworthiness of the fact, and how the right belonging to Embassadors was by himself
violated. The Embassador replied, If any thing had been done contrary to friendship, that ought not to be attri∣buted to him, for the French King, contrary to the Peace made at Verbin, had openly given assistance to Rebells and the Enemies of the true Religion; nor had he onely tempted to corrupt the Counts Heremberg and others in the Netherlands, but had stirred up the Moors to in∣vade Spain. With which reproof the King being more enraged, answered, That the Roman Religion was more indebted to him and his ancestors then the Spaniard, that being untruly reported to be the cause of the War in the Netherlands, because in truth that contest was about Dominion: And if he either would pay what money was due to the Hollanders, or the French, who are a people impatient of ease, would in these parts make War under a famous General, as in the farther Hungary and with the Archduke, how much would that resemble so many treacherous designes intended against Cities, and the tempted fidelity of so many great men? Then he repeated particulars, protesting those things spoken concerning the Moors to be false, and confessions ex∣torted by force: And if it were unlawfull for him to allure the Count Heremberg and others, who were not Low-country-men, but Germans, to unworthy actions, what did they merit who by large promises had drawn away Terral, not onely a Subject, but a Member of his House and family? But these were small matters. But if hap∣ly an Embassador dived into the secrets of State-affairs by politick means, it ought mutually to be dissembled and pardoned; but counsells of cruelty and such as ten∣ded to the hazard of lives ought by him to be refelled. Zunica praising the King of great Britain, that although he differed in Religion, yet he observed the Peace with great reverence; the French King answered, Their friend∣ship
with the Spaniards was but of a new date, but a short time would make appear what it would come to. But at last the Embassador was glad to pacify the King's anger, which began to break out into threats, saying there should be no need thereof, as well the vertues as the wisedome of Henry the Fourth being generally known to most men. But at last Merarges being brought to condigne punishment, the Secretary was restored to the Embassador his Master; it being proved to the King, that it would be better to repay subtlety with policy, then to seek to revenge it by War. About this time a horrible Conspiracy was discovered in Britain, contrived by some who valued their own safety and fidelity and all Laws both divine and humane less then their Zeal to the Roman Religion: for be∣cause they could not by Petition obtain liberty for the exercise of their Rites, hiding a great quantity of Gun∣powder under the Parliament-house, they decreed at the first assembling of the Parliament to blow up the King, the Prince and the Peers of the Kingdome: And the chief Fathers of the Jesuites being consulted with by the authors of the Plot, whether it were lawfull in so great a number of guilty persons to destroy some innocent ones, they answered, that for the great good of the Church some wel-deserving persons might suffer, con∣firming their opinion by an argument of besieged Cities. But one of the more consciencious of them admonishing his friend, that he should not come to the Parliament at the appointed day, the Letter of advice being mistakenly delivered, first gave notice of the designe; and after∣wards the place being found out, both the Treason and the Traitor himself were found out. Upon knowledge whereof, the Conspirators in the farthest parts of Britain broke out into open Rebellion, one Oldcorne a Jesuite
incouraging those that were afraid, lest they judged of the goodness of the cause by one unprosperous event; That God did many times deny success to undertakings well approved by himself, that he might make trial by adversity of his servants constancy and perseverance. But at the very beginning of the same they were appre∣hended, brought to trial and executed: Father Garnet also, who had formerly attempted many things against Queen Elizabeth, being wont highly to extoll the Pope's authority over Kings and Kingdomes, that no faith or obedience was due to Princes by him interdicted, aver∣ring that subjects, if they were commanded, ought to oppose them with Armes even to the hazard of their lives. From whence all in power and authority may learn, who neither stand in awe of the Roman Religion, nor Fleets nor Armies, that they are by Ecclesiastical authority most violent inciters of the common people to Rebellion. They added also another pestilent opinion, That one might answer to any questions proposed by the Magistrate evasively, ambiguously and with mental re∣servations; to that purpose setting forth Books in print, which in defence of a lie they inscribed with lying Titles: And whatsoever was related to them in Confession, ought to be kept secret, and to disclose the same was a sin; although it tended either to the destruction of Prince or people: and in pursuance hereof they named all manner of conferences among themselves, Con∣fessions. It was not doubted but these hopes of Treason were nourished by the Spanish wealth, and the rather, because long since some Societies of English Jesuites were maintained by them purposely to disturb the Peace of that Kingdome. But some that were knowing herein betraied all those forms of private counsells abroad, lest they should still continue unknown; but they that
continued faithfull to Rome and Spain, wanted no con∣venient supplies from thence upon all occasions. And it was told to the Constable of Castile when he was Em∣bassador in England, that if the new King would not al∣low or suffer the Roman Religion, he would find some ready to exact the same by force. And the Archduke fomented jealousies and suspicions, denying to deliver to King James requesting the same such English-men living in those parts, with whom the Prisoners confessed they had participated counsells; the chief of them being sent away into Spain. Yet did not King James take that either as an affront or injury; publishing by Pro∣clamation, that he was satisfied of the innocency of fo∣rein Princes in that business. Nor did King Philip omit to congratulate his delivery from so great a danger by Don John de Mendosa, both in countenance and se∣rious forms of speech to that onely purpose made.
The Fifteenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1606.THE Defence of Antwerp, one of the prin∣cipal Cities of the Netherlands, the taking Towns so strongly fortified, and carrying the Warre into the Enemie's Country, while with less danger and more hope he might have fought elsewhere, added very much to Spinola's honour and renown, he being the first that seemed to put new life and courage into, and to restore the fortune and discipline of, that side which for fifteen years before had been decaying. Therefore which way soever he went among the Netherlanders, there were great exultations and applauses attended him; and when he came into Spain, as his custome was every year, he was privately envied by the Lords, but publickly and with great honour favoured by the King. But the many actions of the former year had so drai∣ned the Treasury, that by the emptiness thereof the present Counsels of the Warre were much retarded, and he but slowly obtained pay for both his Armies, refusing to undertake the charge of the Warre with∣out it; and if he had it, boasting he had in a manner already obtained the Victory, determining, as before he had passed the Rhine, so now he would goe over the Wael and the Yssell, and so penetrate into the very bowels of the Hollanders. Therefore he consented to
help the King's decayed credit with his own and his friends wealth, which with what damage to himself it was done, will be commemorated towards the end of the year. On the other side the Ʋnited States, long fore∣seeing the approaching evils which Armies are wont to draw along with them, increasing their Forces that were at distance, (and they were infinitely vexed with the vast charges of the Garrisons) resolved the follow∣ing year to give way to that violence which they ima∣gined would not endure long, being content to defend their Borders until the fury thereof began to be as∣swaged: Beside, the new Levies intended were hindred in France by the Warre of Sedan, and in Germany by the troubles of Brunswick. Sedan is a City lying hard by the Maes in the confines of the French and Belgick Dominions, and was a place of great concernment if at any time the Warre came towards those parts: Of old it was possessed by the Family of Le Marque; but Henry de Turre Viscount Turein marrying the Daugh∣ter and Heir of the Bulionian Family, gained the inhe∣ritance of the Town, and took the name of Bulion; and although his Wife was dead, retained it by virtue of her Testament, but often undermined by the French greatness, while the affairs of the House of Bourbon were yet but private. He was reckoned among the chief Captains during the unsetled estate of that Kingdome: But after the King had changed his Reli∣gion, and for defence of the Kingdome new Taxes were found our, which gave cause of complaint, and the great multitude that professed the Reformed Reli∣gion had their eies chiefly upon Bulion, he being fa∣mous in Warre, and the frequent author of resolute counsels, he was believed to have caused some commo∣tions.
When he was called to answer his offence, at the same time as Marshal Biron was put to death, excusing himself against the violent animosities of his Enemies, and challenging many of his suspected Judges, he depar∣ted into Germany: And the Prince Elector Palatine be∣ing asked that he would remember his Affinity, (for both of them had married Prince Maurice's Sisters) sent some Embassadours to the King to appease his wrath: but it little prevailed, it being alwaies a thing detested by Kings, to have forein Powers interpose them∣selves for the reconciling their differences. Hereupon the matter was undertaken by Prince William's Wi∣dow; and indeed the Woman's sollicitation proved most effectual: but the King required the custody of Sedan as a pledge of his fidelity. Bulion offered to de∣liver both the Town and Castle to the patronage of the Kingdome of France, and for performance of that agree∣ment consented that as well the Governour as the Souldiers therein should be bound by Oath, and be∣sides this he offered other things, while yet he was not removed from the possession, and in the interim pre∣pared all things for enduring a War, if he should be compelled thereto by necessity. This boldness of his, together with the potent Enemies which he had late∣ly made himself, and besides being a man greedy of honor and impatient to be excelled, forced the King, that marching out that Spring with a great Army he came with his Camp as far as the Maes. Thus did this great King threaten with the fury of a destructive War, not the Spaniard nor the Burgundian, as here∣tofore, but his old friend, the Lord onely of one poor Town. But a meanes being found to make Peace. Bulion was redeemed from that imminent danger, and the King freed from such an inglorious contest. The
King placed a Governor in Sedan for four years, and at the end of that time the custody of the same was to be redelivered to Bulion. By that agreement it was forbidden for any to inquire into his former actions; and if hereafter he should change his allegi∣ance, the Townsmen swore they would chuse them another Prince. This Peace being made, he was re∣stored to his wonted favor with the King, who as he was easily angred, so he was ready and free to pardon; all men wondring to see him that lately was an Enemy, now be at the King's elbow, and inseparable from him both in his cares and recesses. The Castle it self within a moneth was restored to him. This was the ami∣cable issue of that business, which was very pleasing to both parties at War in the Netherlands: For it was a grievous thing to the Hollanders, that one of the same Religion and related to the house of Nassau should be afflicted; and the Archduke was sorely afraid, lest those Armes pretended against Bulion should fall upon himself; and therefore Lewis de Velasco, that was sent to defend the Borders, offered help to them of Sedan, But the Brunswick Commotions began the former year, the Duke having a spleen to the City, because having bought their Privileges partly from his ancestors, and partly extorted them, they defended them with more then ordinary confidence, relying up∣on the Hanseatick League. He replete with hope that he could by his own power restore that Authority which the carelessness of his Ancestors had lost, gathering together his Forces, as if he had dreaded Spinola's com∣ing over the Rhine, first by ambushes planting some Soul∣diers, he invaded the more outward of the two Walls that encompassed the City: but the assailants being re∣pulsed, they fell to open hostility and a Siege, which,
though the King of Denmark, whose Sister was married to the Duke, came with a notable strength to his as∣sistance, the Winter broke off. The United States being requested by the Duke to send Count Ernest of Nassau as General with some Forces to his as∣sistance, were in a great suspense, because it appeared to them an unseemly thing to oppress the liberty of another, while they so hotly contested for their own: and yet rather for the King of Denmark and the Duke of Brunswick's sake then the Hanseatick Cities, who had not assisted the Hollanders either by wealth or any other kindness whatsoever, it was thus mode∣rated; They would not send him, but that he might goe with some new Forces if he pleased: to whom some Colonels and Captains joyned and associated them∣selves, requesting that for that time their Oath might be dispensed with, being covetous to gain those re∣wards which are more readily given at the breaking out of a new War. But this high contest was ended in a short time: for at the entrance of the Spring, the Leaguer about the Town being anew begun, and the dam broken, by which the Duke hoped to bring the restrained River upon the City, and by that means to shorten the Siege; the Hanseatick Forces being col∣lected, prevailed with him to desist from the War. To both parties unable to bear the charge the Emperor's authority was interposed, which commanded them, that they should voluntarily and out of reverence to the Laws proceed judicially, since they seemed in honor thereto to lay down their Armes. Besides these af∣fairs which were common to the Hollanders and their Enemies, there were certain peculiar causes which hindred the Enemies Levies of men both in Britain and Italy. For in Britain the King being forewarned
how dreadful those Subjects were that acknowledged power superiour to the King, conceived a new form of an Oath to oblige all his Subjects, whereby they were  confess him the true and lawful King of Britain, and that he could not be deposed by the authority of the Church of Rome or the Pope: and if that should be at∣tempted, yet that they should bear unto him faith and legeance, and discover all things that might tend to the King's damage; and that in the taking the said Oath they had no other meaning then the common use of the words expressed, and that they did not hope to be absolved from the same. From hence arose great discord even among the Catholicks themselves; while part of them, by the allowance of George Blackwel an Archbishop of England, (for so the Pope had entitled him) took the said Oath without fear, supposing a di∣stinction between sacred and temporal affairs; and as they ought to doe their duty to God in point of Reli∣gion, so in all things else by the command of God himself they were bound to obey their Princes: On the other hand, some believed the Jesuites, that humane things ought to be subservient to Divine, and so, that he who was the great Arbiter of Religion, if necessity re∣ited the same, might transferre Kingdomes, that be∣ing a most sacred Order, that all things should be sub∣ject to one. In the interim they that demurred at the taking of the Oath were forbidden to goe out of the Kingdome into any forein service. And the Pope's au∣thority in Italy made the like, if not greater, troubles and delaies: For the Venetians fearing the wealth and potency of the Priesthood, and imitating the Decrees of other Nations, forbad them to build Temples, or to give lands to Abbeys or Monasteries, unless they were licensed thereto by Decree of the Senate, and
that the Revenues of Church-lands should at no time return to them: besides, they commanded some Priests to be put into Prison, because they were ac∣cused of Sorcery, Parricide, Incest, Falshood and pub∣lick Force. Pope Paul the fifth, by the instigation chiefly of the Cardinals Bellarmine and Baronius, interpreting these things to be done in despight of him, when they were refused to be taken away, interdicted and excom∣municated the City. Cardinal Baronius, in some Let∣ters by him sent to the Venetians, advised them among other things to take heed lest God, being angry with them as he was once with the Hebrews, should take away their Liberty, and make a Lord over them. Many Books were written, wherein a long time it was dis∣puted what was the power of the Laws, or of any other Sentences, upon those that were wholly devoted to Religion, or whether the Pope's unjust commands obliged their Consciences. The greatest part of the Priests in the Venetian territories did not abstain from performing all publick services in the Church; and the Jesuites, when they refused to doe the same, were banished. While this matter was hoped to break out into Arms, the Spaniard, who had received it from his Ancestors to augment the Troubles of Italy, raised Souldiers there, boasting himself the Defender of the Pope's Majesty. On the other side, the Hollanders, partly out of hatred to the Pope, and partly out of love to a free City, promised the Venetians some as∣sistance by Sea, if they should be indangered: for which they returned them great thanks by Letters with much candor of language. But that prudent Se∣nate, as they would stoutly defend the rights of their Dominion, so they studiously avoided all things that
might hinder Peace or the ceremonies of greater af∣fairs. However this was the beginning of friendship between those two most potent people, who would ne∣ver endure the Rule or name of a King. While these things were doing in forein parts, at the beginning of this year the Hollanders send a Fleet into Spain, to increase the dearth and scarcity of all things which was rumored to be there; and also for vindicating those losses they had received by the vio∣lent assault of their Ships by Lewis Faizard, the said Ships lying unprovided and unguarded at some Ameri∣can Islands seeking for Salt, whose Mariners and Sea∣men he either drowned, hanged, or burned. But first the States set out an Edict, that none of their Citi∣zens nor any foreiner should either carry Corn or other things into Spain: And it being found both for∣merly and of late, several Ships in hope of commerce had been inticed thither, and made use of for warre∣e purposes, they now would goe to beset the Ene∣mie's Ports, whither whosoever would goe, should have their share of what booty should be taken. In this Fleet were four and twenty Ships at the publick charge, under the command of Mine Heer William van Hauten, besides those that were set out and ar∣med by private men in great number, but very unapt to be kept under command. Their Orders were to tcept the Fleet coming out of America, and to op the Portugal Ships that were going out to the Indies; to which purpose the Indian Company had brought a great summe of money into the Treasury, whereby, being freed both from their Enemie's Arms and all other contestants, they might have the more gainful and safe returns of their Merchandise.
Van Hauten had but a very slow passage, by reason of the crossness of the winds, yet got abundance of booty, because he took all Merchants he mer, and wasted the Coasts. The Portugal Ships were so long kept in their Harbours, that, despairing to get out, they discharged their received lading again on shore. Of the American Fleet news was brought, that one laden with the King's Silver, being entangled with a Holland Ship, was together with it burned; three suf∣fered Shipwreck by Storm, four were empty in the Port Havana; for that was added, that they might stay the time of their coming out. But now Van Hauten began to want Victuals, and the winde hindred those fresh Ships that the Hollanders sent to bring them new provisions: And for these causes at the beginning of Summer he returned home, sooner by much then he was expected. But although the Armies made a slow progress, yet there was no cessation of taking care for the Warre: Terral being chiefly unsatisfied, and laying the blame of the miscarriage of his design not upon himself, but his Souldiers, afterwards by accident lighted upon some Holland Horsemen, where be∣ing wounded, and hardly escaping by flight, as he began to amend and gather strength, so he grew more earnest and desirous of revenge. At his command therefore five hundred Spanish Horse passed the Rhine, giving out in speeches that they came to seek out the Hollanders Hors who having conducted Count Er∣nest of Nassau to the borders of Brunswick, retur∣ned through the Country of Paderborn taking great booty. But Prince Maurice having intelligence by his Scouts that Terral was in those parts, admonished
all the Garrisons beyond the Rhine, that they should take eed of receiving damage by too much security. But Ter∣rall taking Twelve hundred Foot out of Oldenzeel, and avoid∣ing Groll in his March, fetching a long compass by Night, e arrived at Breesfort. It was then by chance Shrove-tide, a time of mirth, so that all as well Souldiers as Towns-men, had taken to themselves a liberty of feasting and merriment: The Night-Watches were at first deceived, they that were with Terrall of their own accord, crying out, That they were Mauritians, and were necessitated, being overpressed by the Enemy, to fly for shelter thither under the protection of their Friends. And they scarcely began to suspect the fraud, when by ap∣plication of their Engines, they had forced two Gates, and were come to the innermost, there being very little time spent in the doing these things, that a few only running to the Works, they quickly found it was in vain to think of de∣fending the Town; the rest flying to the Castle, which had its peculiar Fortifications, and the Bridge being broken down, was quite separated from the Town: The men that remained in the Town were slain, so also were some women after they had been lustfully abused; There were four Can∣nons in the Castle, and as many in the Town, but they want∣ed Gun-powder; Nor did the Governour of the Castle omit to send Messengers into the next Towns, desiring them to send him assistance, for that he was resolved to endure the uttermost extremity, rather than quit the place: Here∣upon the Troops of Over-Issell being immediately drawn together by their Commander Warmeloo, and placing the Foot behind the Horsemen, through the Marshy Lands he brought them into the Castle, breaking through the Fort, wherewith the Spaniards hoped to have shut up the passage. They also that held the Town, sent for ayd to Lewis de Ve∣laseo; who had a strong Garrison in Rooroorfe, from whence be presently sent Four hundred Foot laden with Gun-pow∣der: but hearing that the Hollanders were about the Town,
they durst not enter it, although the Mootiness of the places, and the darkness, together with the paucity of the Enemy, gave them conveniency and opportunity enough for policy. In their return they were met with by Colonel Fillers Horse, and put to flight, part of them being slain, and part taken: In the mean while however, Prince Henry of Nassau going from the Hague, and gathering together as many Foot as he could, and those Horse which we menioned to return out of Patelborne, came thither, and perfected the Siege; which they in the Town were not able to endure long, being with great fury vexed with shot from the Castle, so that within Eight dayes they wanted above an hundred of their men; the rest securing their Lives in Trenches and Caves under ground: At last it was agreed, That the Enemy should go away safe, restoring what Prey they had taken, as also the Prisoners, which they had sent to Oldenzeel while they re∣mained in the Town. This haste the Besiegers thought fit to make, because the Spanish Forces were drawing together on all hands: But if he had persisted, Terrall being taken, would have been an acceptable Present to the French King, and should have been a Pattern, whereby they should have been punished for the Cruelty they used in their Victory, the terrour whereof should have been such to all unfortunate attempts of that sort, as for the future should have rather made them to seek their Conquests by fair Warr, than Trea∣chery and Surprises. But Terrall nothing terrified herewith, undertakes grea∣ter matters, and wanted but little of doing as much in one Night, as deserved the labour of a whole Year. He had re∣ceived intelligence by some Run-aways, That on the East side of Scluys, there were no Watches kept without the Town, the Guards being burned heretofore, and not re∣builded. Therefore taking through the marshy Fields of Cazant Twelve hundred Walloons and Irish with him, he came unobserved to a Fort of the Enemies, whither he de∣signed,
it lying just in his way. It was agreed also, That Frederick Count Heremberg should bring more and greater forces to Damme, to assault the Castle as soon as the City should be taken: But as the beginning of their Enterprize succeeded beyond hope, so the latter end proved quite con∣trary. Two Draw-Bridges and one Gate being forced by the Engines applyed to them, the innermost that only re∣mained, hitherto made a noyse, which forced them to apply two Petards, and now nothing withstood them, but that they might go to the very Rampire, which was not very high, all within the Town remaining secure. Colonel Notte having in∣telligence, that the Enemy intended some Stratagem, advised all his Neighbour Covernors, That they should take heed to their Charges: not once suspecting the Design to be inten∣ded against himself, that the Enemy would invade the Town so difficult to come to by its inward Scituation, and com∣passed round about with so many Guards on every side, and therefore he gave himself to ease; and by his example, so did others. At first they that entred were afraid, because finding so great silence, and no stirring, they believed they were discovered, and that there was some Plot laid to in∣trap them: It fortuned, that part of the Souldiers, who were commanded to set upon another part of the Town at an appointed time, not performing what was commanded, because the Clock of the Town did not strike that Night, whereby the hours were not discerned. While these de∣layed, to break in, where the way lay open to them: Some few in the Town awaked, partly with the cracking of the Gates, and partly with the noyse of the Enemies Arms, half naked, and half armed, as they leaped from their beds, shut up the inner Gate. And surely here the assaylants were much too short, that they had placed Pikes in the Front, and not Musketeers, the Pikes not being so ready to enter against Shot. Hereupon the first being beaten off, fear possessed the rest, which made them flye, but they were hindred by
the confused Numbers, that stood crowded together upon the Bridg: And now Colonel Notte the Governour having planted some great Guns, made a great slaughter among them as they stood in heaps in the narrow passages. Almost Five hundred were killed with shot, drowned and over∣whelmed in water and dirt: Nor did they return without the losse of blood, for the Enemy now appearing in publick, the Souldiers on all hands from the Forts issued out, and fell on in the Rear, making great havock. This terrible danger being escaped, care was taken, (which ought to have been done before) that a Redoubt should be made before the Gate; And by the Arch-Duke's Command, some of the Officers, whose carelessness was principally accused, were punished with great severity, being made an example to others, that they should rather chuse any honourable danger, then by neglect and disobedience of Commands, to incur a certain and sordid punishment. Now the hope of the Venetian Warr being deferred, by reason of the scarcity of provisions in Italy, the Spanish Re∣giments came thence into the Netherlands. So also did Spi∣nola, though retarded by a Feaver, and the report of his death had much increased the Hollanders security, with no less joy, (though it proved false) then if thereby they had hoped to have been delivered from foreign Arms. Upon the disbanding of the French Army, some came to the States; but the greatest part of the Duke of Brunswick's Forces went to Spinola, John Count Ridberg, Brother to the Transamasian Earl, having suffered some damage by the Hollanders Incursions, conducting to him also part of the Horse, but part of the Money that was intended to the Mar∣quess, was intercepted; And the Hollanders wasted the Country about Mechelen, because they denyed to pay Con∣tribution. And Spinola having determined at the middle of Summer, and going into places, in his opinion, full of water, divided both his Cares and Forces with Count Bucquoy.
To whom he assigns Ten thousand Foot, and Twelve hun∣dred Horse, and Twelve pieces of Artillery, with com∣mand to go into that part of Holland, which the Rhine divi∣ded into another channel called the Waell, encompasseth; Himself, with Eleven thousand Foot, and Two thousand Horse, and but Eight Cannons, thinking of many things, yet steared his course chiefly to Friezeland and the Veluwe, for so is that part of Gelderland called, which is compassed with the Rivers Rhene and Issell, then he considered of Ʋtrecht, a great City and strong, but apt to Seditions from the unstable vulgar. And that he might proceed with the more expedition, he removed from the Camp all Women, and filled the Carriages with Victuals, Boats, Bridges, and Mills: And if what he designed had come to pass, and the Two Armies had met on both sides, the very heart of the United Provinces, and all the places of less strength, lay open to the sudden violence, and the outer and more fortified places had been torn away from helping them either with Provisions or otherwise: But thick & cloudy weather atten∣ded with much Rain, detained Spinola as he was entring the Borders of the Tubantes: From thence the Souldiers con∣tracting Sicknesses, and growing weak, their passage lying altogether through marishy wayes, that they in the Rear could hardly reach them in the Van in a second days March: Thus had the Marishes more than ordinarily wet, and lying scattered up and down, stopped the passage into Frizeland: Besides the Issell, a River not contemptible at other times, was so swelled with excess of Rain; that it was not fordable in any place. By these delays, Prince Maurice having gained time to get his Souldiers together (in number Ten thousand Foot, and Two thousand five hundred Horse) those be appointed to lye by the River, and to re-enforce with Works and Garrisons, Deuenter, Zutphen, and Doesburg, being principal Towns, and to leave the rest to Fortune and the Event. But the Marquess revolving in his thoughts
various Consultations, while he tryes all things, while the weather grew more serene, hating idleness, sent some to besiege Lochem, a Town in the Jurisdiction of Zutphen, meanly fortified, but conveniently scituate for any that in∣tended to stay in those Parts; It was only kept by Three hundred men, the Garrison being but small, while the care was chiefly taken for greater Cities: Deuenter being chiefly dissembled as if it had been aimed at, had drawn Prince Maurice thither; therefore the next day having made ap∣proaches even to the Trench; the Town was delivered and the Spaniards thought fit to fortifie a little Hill near hand. At the same time Pompey Justiniano by Bucquoy's Com∣mand, leading Four thousand Foot, Five hundred Horse, and two Canons, early in a morning came to a Village named Spardage, on the left bank of the Wael, and put the most nimble of the Souldiers into Boats, each of which carried Thirty, and himself afterwards carrying over the rest, com∣manding them at once in an excellent order to loose from the Shore, and also to land at the appointed place; for it was not easie to land every where: But Warner Dubois, to whom the Prince had given in Charge the defence of that side of their Territories, being called from Nimmeghen by hasty. Messengers, had filled the inner bank: which sight certified the Mariners, who counterfeiting that they were carried away by force of the River, that they might not at∣tain the designed place, soon after returned back: But Justi∣niano prepared once more to set his Souldiers over the Wael, but the Hollanders overpowring them by multitude of For∣ces, prevented it. Then Prince Maurice, careful lest the Enemy lying upon him in so many places, and with so great Forces, he might receive some unexpected damage, fortified all from the first division of the Rhine, unto the meeting of the same with the Waell hard by Bommell, then Raising new Works on
e other side from Arnheym to Hattem within the Rhine and Issell, therewith he enclosed all that great space, leaving no greater distance between Work and Work, than might be convenient for the giving of Signs to each other, either by the eyes or ears: He commanded also some Boats continually  passe to and fro in the Rivers to observe the motions and endeavours of the Enemy, and to give intelligence. Below Hattem, about four hours Journey, the River Issell falls into the Zuyderzee: And the River Vecht coming by the Borders of Westfalia, and mingling with the Waters, which passing the bituminous soyl of Trent, take the name of the River Aer or Black; making his bendings become Neighbour to Issell, untill it imbosomes it self into the same. The Coun∣try that lyes between those Rivers and the Sea, is called Masterbruick, not vainly conjectured from antiquity, that the name thereof was extracted from the Mattiaci (which are now Zelanders). It was a Peninsula, but now a Ditch, and other Works between the Rivers had reduced it into the form of an Island, in which part is scituate Swoll, a Town of Over-Issell. After the taking other places, Spinola conceived a hope to shut up Swoll: And that he might delude their thoughts, choosing to go through the parts adjoyning to Zutphen, from whence sending some small shot, he sent Count Solre to assay and found the Issell. But the wetness of the weather hindred the sudden executing of that Design, until the report of their arrivall was brought to Swoll; and Warmelo being at that time Governour there, assisted by two Ships of Warr, resisted the Enemy preparing to pass the River Vecht. Solre had brought with him two great Guns, but by reason the Bullets were too big, and the Timber wherewith they should be sustained, not fitted by the error of those that were to make them ready, they were of no use. When this did not succeed, and all that hope of passing the River coming to nothing, they turned thenceforward all their intentions to
the besieging of Towns: Spinola himself sitting down be∣fore Groll, a Town in the Province of Zutphen: Bucquoy was commanded to attaque Nimmeghen, that they might divert the Enemy from the defence of Issell, if they could do nothing else. Wherefore Bucquoy first sending to know the Arch-Duke's Pleasure, and being resolved thereof, he agreed in the same Judgment, and pretended to spend the time in finding out other wayes to get over the Waell, and in studying other Policies, fearing lest he should prejudice his honour by labouring in vain. Groll is compassed with a double Rampire on all sides, but where it is washed with the River Slingen, the Garrison which consisted of Thirteen hundred Souldiers, was govern∣ed by Colonel Dorte, a young man sprung from Noble An∣cestors, but otherwise unknown: At first they made a Sally, but afterwards did nothing but shoot from their Works, which were not valued by the Enemy, to whom the losse of time was more considerable than that of men. The outer∣parts of the Works were neglected as not expecting a storm, whereat the Italians and Spaniards the seventh day after en∣tred, being helped by Bridges which they had purposely made: but the Germans, to whom the third Quarter was designed, came on more slowly. After this first the Italians filling up the Trench, took the Bullwark, but the rest were either repulsed, or further distant. Then the Towns-men fearing undermining and more near fights, go to the Gover∣nour, and beseech him, That he would prevent extremity, and not provoke the Generall, that was as well prodigall of his own mens Lives, as his Enemies. With which desires he was overcome, though he had received Letters that assur'd him of Relief within two dayes: for Prince Maurice had drawn the Garrisons out of all the Cities of Over-Issell, and near the Wael, with an intent to raise the Siege: This being told to Spinola, he offered honourable conditions to such as would march away; but added great Threats to such as should
continue obstinate. And here give me leave to say, that there was not a greater Care taken for any parts than for Groll, and the other Towns before taken, when they Articled for Sur∣er, almost all the Townsmen remain'd there content, with any kind of Religion, and any Form of Govern∣ment. Thus Groll being taken, the Marquess, although the scar∣city of Victuals, together with abundance of Rain, had fill'd all the Country with Water, Resolved to besiege Berck, situ∣ate in a more elevated Soil, and Provisions near to be brought in the Camp: For after the Designs of higher Concernment proved all Abortive, he supposed no place more worthy to rive for with all his Forces, whether he minded the Ho∣nour of the Attempt, or Commodity of the place. For Berck, according to the manner of building in former Ages, had Stone-Walls roughly laid together, and a Trench adjoyning to them. In this War, the possession of that place had bin often alter'd: In which variety of Fortune, a slight Bulwark, and another Trench, had bin made about it, partly by the Spaniards, and partly by the Hollanders: But the Year last past Count Ernest, sent thither to that purpose, had made a New Line about it, with Sconces and Half-Moons, and in some places with Forts; land hereto was added a Trench, a small Redoubt being made before it: And then, that the Garrison might have the moe Room, Lodgings were made for the Souldiers under Ground in the Form of Trenches; and every where about the Fields, where it was thought fit, were little Works made foursquare, for the Souldiers to keep Guard in. And the Island that lyes before the Town, was fortified in like manner: From thence a Bridge was made over the Rhine to the Bank, on the German side; and on the Bank it self was a handsom Fort pretty large, and another less, and then again Breast works. Bucquoy leaving Gelderland, came first to the Town, through the Bishoprick of Colen, ta∣king, in his March, a Holland Ship that lay in the Rhine, and
burning others that were deserted by the Sea-men. But be∣fore the Passages were all shut up, Prince Maurice's Brother Henry came from his Camp (which had continued at Dors∣burg till that time) and brought into the Town a great Bad of Horse, and 14 Companies of Foot: Wherewith the Gar∣rison (being great before) was so increased, that they were near 200 Horse, and above 3000 Foot: The rest of the Horse Prince Henry brought back to the Camp, neither provoking the Enemy to fight, nor being provoked by them. At this time several young Noble-men and Gentlemen of France, among whom was the Duke of Roan's Brother, of their own free-will entred into the Town, and were there besieged, minding to make known their Valour, and to learn the Arts Military, Whether relating to the Assaults of Towns, or the De∣fence thereof. After a few days, Autumn now approaching, Spinola made Inroads into the Dutchy of Cleves, and undertook, in person, to break into some Forts beyond the Rhine, and by that means Prince Maurice to follow if he duist. The Besieged at first made a Sally that way, and had well-nigh taken the General himself, who was abroad onely with a few Atten∣dants. The next Attempt they made was upon Bucquoy's Camp, where the Baron of Flessie a French Noble-man, more valiantly, than waly, assaulting the Enemy, was taken Priso∣ner: And while Spinola, having now joyned the Leaguers with a Bridge, wearies out the Fort beyond the River, and other Works, with Shot; Edmund Collonel of the Scots Re∣giment, dyed of a Wound; and so much prevail'd the death of this Valiant Man, and Expert Leader, that they in the Garrison having lost the Bank, Retreated into the Island, the Rhine defending those places of Safety against the Enemy. But on that side the Town towards Colen, the Works were assaulted by Cannon, by Mines, and last of all by Storm. But the Prince sending to the States, desiring by Letters, To know what they thought fit to be done; and they returning Answer,
That they left all to his Discretion: So that he might, if he pleased, fight the Enemy, making many publike Offers, as  be intended to raise the Siege, whereby he might put Courage into his own men, and give the longer delay to the Enemy, he privately Resolved in his Mind, to spin out the rest of the Year with the loss of Berck: And as he was not to be moved by Reports, so was he wary of Accidents, being  without fear, lest, if by bringing away his Army, he should leave those middle parts naked, Spinola, leaving the siege, should again attempt to pass the Wael, and the Issel; and then the Enemy being gotten into the Bowels of the Country, all would condemn that vain-glorious Rashness, that preferred specious shews before reall safety. Therefore, Re∣solving to go no further, and intending to attempt no other Towns, he concluded to lye upon the Watch near the Wesel; now pretending, that the Bridges came too late; anon, that the Enemy was drawn nearer; but still keeping the Souldiers in the Camp, who burned with a desire of fighting; yet to keep the Souldiers in Action, he brought them to a Fort begun by the Enemy, where the River Lppe mingles with the Rhine, which he compell'd to surrender, and afterwards perfected it; and that nothing might hinder them, he steer'd his course whither soever occaion requir'd, by many Noble Attempts, making Spinola fortifie his Camp, which before lay open, seizing all the little adjoyning Hills. In this time, the Besieged lyed forth very often, and every time with a greater number: nor was their Fortune or Success unlucky, the French-mens Gallantry appearing in all places: But as the Enemies Force drew nearer, they did them no small damage by Mines. But their Courages began to fail, when they saw no hope of Relief, and the Enemy se∣cured from the danger of their shot, daily advanced their Works, sparing neither Powder, nor other kinds of fighting. The Besieged had Gunpowder enough to have served them a long time; but they were so prodigal thereof at first, that
the want thereof was one of the main causes that hastned the Surrender. Collonel Utenboven, the Governour of Berck, see∣med more willing to yield it, in favour to the French, lest be should desperately cast away so much gallant Youth, which were the Hopes and Pledges of so many great Families, into utter Ruine, without doing any good to their Country. At last many of their Bulwarks being taken, and the inner Works but very weak, the Town, Island, and such Ships as were there, were deliver'd up. About 500 were slain in the Camp, but not so many in the Town, among whom was Saintange a French-man, of great Parentage. The loss of this famous Town much troubled the Hollanders, who hereupon consi∣der'd what was the Fortune of War, if no Army went against it, yet the Fortifications would subsist but for a short time. This place was gotten with the immense Labour of Fortify∣ing, that it might be lost by a Siege, that held but a Moneth, and a few days over, while Berck, six Years before, being out of Repair, and void of Works, contemned and held out their Arms a far longer time. The day before Berck was surrendred, Prince Henry of Nassaw taking part of the Forces, by Night attempted to break into Vensoo, having forced the Gate with a Retard, and some of the Souldiers, with great earneness, going by the Bulwark, that lyes close by the Maes: But another Gate hin∣dred them, and before it could be broken, the Townsmen, together with the Horse and Foot of the Garrison, repell'd the Assailants. In another part Designs were laid by some Swimmers and Ships out of Zeland, upon some Maritime Towns of Flanders, but the Success was not answerable to Hopes. At this time, some unfortunate News out of America, grievously weakned Spinola's Credit, already wavering with the Greatness of the Usury he paid; some Merchants, whose Accounts with him were unsetled, being compell'd to break promise with him: Whereupon he wanted Money, and being
wonted to give the Souldier part of his Pay, out of his own Revenue, now he was not able to do that. And lately the Governour of Wachtendenck punish'd some Seditious Threats, by the death of one Souldier, and the punishment of two more: After this continual marching, and labouring in the Camp renewed Discipline: But after Berck was lost, and that the Hollanders had nothing in those parts besides Moers, which it was fear'd Spinola would attaque, notwithstanding the Autumn was so far spent, and it had a considerable Gar∣rison: Nor did Poverty onely, and the want of Fodder pinch the Horsemen chiefly, but the Infirmities of Diseases affli∣cted all the rest; so that many led to Prince Maurice, and part went to other places: They that had more Courage, shnning Sloth, began to mutiny, and employ'd themselves in making Bullets, and wandring about the Fields, till at last they fell to choosing themselves a Head, and ordaining all other Things, that use to set forth Seditions to belong and durable. While their Paucity was contemptible, Spinola first pro∣scribed them of their Commands, and proceeded against them as Offenders against the Law: But when they began to grow more powerful, he was glad to flatter them by Mes∣sengers: But as his Threats were without Authority, so his Promises, with reall Performances, were little esteemed. Al∣most 600 of them went to Hochstraten, the noted Receptacle for such Beginnings; but that place was not at this time for∣tified, because it was lately agreed between the Arch-Duke and the Hollanders, That he should suffer that place, and they also Woud, to be free and exempt from War, to be enjoyed by the right Owners thereof: And by Albertus his Order, they heard, that his Forces were coming to take Revenge upon them: There∣fore they drew towards Breda, and sent to the Governour Justine of Nassaw, to inform him, That they, according to the Example of others their Companions, were fled to Prince Mau∣rice's Protection, whom they knew to bear a respect to valiant∣men;
That they did not esteem it so slight a matter to fight against him, that they would do it without their Reward or Wages. These Desires of the Seditious were answer'd, by sending them Provision and Arms, together with the hopes of Assistance, in case they should be endanger'd. Spinola moved herewith, that this Evil might not spread further, he sends the most Active and Cordial of his Men into the Neighbour Towns, and disperseth the rest of the Army over the whole Country of Colen, as Mendosa had formerly done; and likewise he re∣ceives Money from some Cities, to keep the Souldiers from coming among them, who (to say the truth) were not evilly inclined, as long as they were not necessitated. From these troubled Affairs of the Enemy, the United States conceived hopes of recovering what they had lost this year beyond the Rhine, having a sufficient Army by the ad∣dition of those that were come out of Berck, being near fif∣teen thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse. No less did the Enemy make hast, in this juncture of time, while neither party much minded the future; that their Forces (whose o∣bedience for want of pay, had been exhausted) might be re∣encouraged and brought again into one Body. Count Ernest of Nassaw being sent to Lochem with part of the Souldiers, the fourth day after his Arrival gained it, upon the same Terms that Spinola had late given it. About the same time also did the Prince attaque Groll, Autumn then coming on apace, which place was defended by Henry Count Heremberg, with six hundred Foot, and his own Troop of Horse, and much Artillery. And by chance, a great quantity of Rain having lately fallen, so that the Pio∣neers could not with conveniency come to work, not only delayed and protracted the Siege, but brought many disea∣ses into the Camp. And the Souldiers were spared, in hopes that the Weather would become more seasonable, when at the instant arrived News, That Spinolaes Forces that had been dispersed into Garrisons up and down the
Countrey, were collected together from thence. And then the Princes earnest desire to continue the Siege, and Fortify the Camp against outward Force, made the Souldiers work and Duty double, though in regard of the Enemies being so near, it was too late; for Spinola himself, and his Officers, those Authority with the Souldiers was of high esteem, ringling together Prayers and Promises, incited them, That they would not refuse that short and easy undertaking, that would let to them of so great advantage, and so much to their Honour. He had gotten together seven thousand Foot, and twelve hundred Horse, a number much unequal to Prince Maurice, yet he pressed on to Fight, either confident in his own mens Valor, or knowing that the Enemy by all means endeavou∣red to avoid a Battel, in which conceit he was not decei∣ved. He himself was in the Front with twelve hundred men, the choicest Souldiers of all his Army, then two Regi∣ments of Spaniards and Italians, and last of all were placed the New levyes of Germany; to each of these Divisions were assigned ten Cannons, the Horse were drawn up on the Banks, being guarded by the Carriages, lest they should be wer-run by Prince Maurice's Troops, for that part of their Enemies Army they chiefly feared; and receiving Intelli∣gence by their Scouts what part of the Camp was fortified slightly only with Pallisadoes; he shewed his Main Batel on the side, although it was a great way about, and his pas∣sage much hindred by the Marishes. Prince Maurice, Al∣though the States had given him order and power to fight, and that his Souldiers were earnest thereto, but the French especially cryed out, That they must perpetually seek lurking places, and daily fly from the Enemy, if now they should give place in a few, and they tyred out with wet, cold, and long Marches: yet he withdrew his men into the safety of his Camp, which was the cause of the breeding Diseases among many of his men, and striking a fear into those that remained healthful, Spinola accounted it a great Victory to have raised the Siege,
and to have elevated the courage of his own men, and to have impaired the Enemies Glory. Soon after this, both parties went into Winter Quarters. This year, the States dismissed Colonel Foxes German Regiment, that had meri∣ted greater Honour and Rewards than the rest, which ex∣ample was taken in very evil part. In this posture stood the War at Land. But in the Spanish Ocean, after the publick Arms were departed thence, Private Men of War did no small damage, and the Spanish great Ships pursued the Hollanders, and their lesser were voluntarily set aside. At the end of this Sum∣mer, Admiral Hauteen was again sent to intercept the Fleets comming out of America and the Indies, he had with him four and twenty Vessels, but of these six were beaten back by Tempests. And soon after Fiasciardo, with eight great Ga∣leons, having a prosperous gale, fell upon them unprovided, and ere they were aware: but the Galleyes that were with him, not being driven by the Wind, kept to the Shoar. As the bulk of the Galeons, so, the terror thereof, to that time, had been very formidable, and although the Hollanders re∣membred that some such had formerly been spoiled by Tem∣pests, or split upon the Rocks, yet they had no president of any of them at any time worsted in fight. One of these be∣ing grapled with a Ship of Zeland that was next the Admiral, so affrighted the rest, as soon as they saw it, that at the very beginning of the night, they retreated in all hast. He thus left by his Companions, being a man of an undaunted Re∣solution, yet for two whole dayes did not leave off the Fight, though most of his men were in that time lost, but with his torn Ship, casting aside all fear of danger, protracted their Victory. But after he saw no hopes of relief, and that the Waves poured in upon him, that none of them might come alive into the Enemies hands, at once they unanimously a∣greed upon a noble, but terrible action, and of much advan∣tage to their Countrey; for kneeling down upon their knees,
and Praying God, That he would please to pardon them, in that they sought to shun the mockeries of the Spaniards, by that sad and  death; they set fire upon the Gunpowder, by the force whereof, threescore men were killed, two half dead, lived a little while, being taken by the Spaniards, with wonder beholding their dreadful countenances and words, together with their obstinacy even in death. The Hollanders being dispersed hither and thither with Fleets, surprized some ships comming out of the Indies to Lisbon, and from America to St. Lucar de Barrameda. And they that came from the Indies free from the Enemies, were miserably afflicted with Tempasts. Two Ships not far from the Cape of good Hope, by throwing overboard their Mer∣chandises, being empty, escaped the danger of Wreck, and got to the Coasts of Mosambique. Also two at the very mouth of the River Tagus sprung leaks, whereby the greatest part of their Merchandises was spoiled with the Salt Water, but the Seamen and Pilots made a shift to escape; But the A∣merican Fleet, to the number of Fifty Sail, with very good Success, returned and brought, as well to the King as the Merchants, great store of Silver, and other pretious Com∣modities, the total product of a two years Voyage, whereby the apparent poverty of Spain was in some measure relieved, and the credit thereof suddenly repaired. But the Hollan∣ders lost all the cost and labour they had been at. However in the Indies, some of their Affairs went on with more happy Fortune, for Stephen Verhagens Fleet, which we mentioned to go out about three years ago, now returned, bringing home with it the Honour of many Victories, samed through the World, and the amicable Leagues of divers Princes; for first of all they met a Portugall Carrack not far from Mosam∣bique, which they took and burned, that for the future it might be no more troublesome to them. Another they sei∣zed upon the same Coasts, and a third comming from Cale∣. There Samorini King of Malabar, hating the Portugall,
name, from whom they had received much damage, and to whom they did all the injury they could, voluntarily desired a League with the Hollanders, which was afterwards conclu∣ded, and confirmed with in Oath. This King had very nu∣merous Land Forces, but wanted Shipping exceedingly. The Letters which he sent to Prince Maurice, declared, That he was well pleased the Hollanders should build a Fort in his Land, and that having drawn Hidalcane a most Potent Neighbour King into the same League (being both Mahometans), they would take all opportunities of advantage against the chief Colonies of the Portugueses, both in Cochin and Goa. But the Embassadors sent by the King of Achem, to the States and the Prince, returning into their Country, filed Sumatra, and all the Neighbour-places, with the report of famous Countries, and a Nation, that even at home main∣tained great Wars: Afterward, another Ship came into their power, wherein was the Spanish Governour of the Mo∣luccaes: Not far from these Molucca Islands, is Amboyna, which also as many other parts of that World, is possessed by the Portugueses; but the Natives of the place, hating the Tyranny of their Lords, greedily accepted the Hollanders friendship, as soon as they came thither; for which cause, many indignities and injuries being done to them, made their fidelity to these as constant, as their malice was obdu∣rate against the other. The Governour of the Castle, when he saw the Fleet come under the very Fortifications, sent fiercely to ask them, who they were, and what they had to do with the Garison which was committed to his Charge. They answered, That they came thither by the Command of the United States, and Prince Maurice, and that they were publick Enemies, both to the King and People of Spain, and also to himself, and in a short time, he should find who they were, and immediately all things were pre∣pared to assault the place: But He, as he was fierce towards those that were weak, or under his power; so trembling at
the sight of an Armed Enemy, without any assault, surren∣dred the Castle, that was furnished with thirty Pieces of Cannon: from whence six hundred with himself, were trans∣ported to the next Coasts in Ships, provided by the Hollan∣ders for that purpose. But forty six Portugueses, with their Families, stayed in their old places of abode, and willingly took an Oath, to be faithful to the States and Prince Maurice. With the chief men of the Country (for they govern the Island) a League was made, in effect, the same with that which we mentioned before to be concluded with them of Banda. Onely this was added, that every individual person, should confirm their fidelity to the Hollanders with an Oath: Here a Garrison being left, the Fleet was divided, and some sent to Banda, and five Ships under the Conduct of Cornelius Sebastian, went to the Indies. But that it may throughly be understood of what concern the Affair was, that was hotly contested for, between two such powerful Nations at Sea; we must make a higher and more narrow scrutiny. Among the many thousand Islands contained in the Indian Sea, whose number till this time hath been unknown, five are more excellently eminent, for this one thing chiefly, that they bear Cloves, a most fragrant Spice, and of very great use in the seasoning of the most dainty Dishes. Their most known names at this day are Ternata, Tideris, Motiel, Ma∣, and Bacian: formerly there were some other, to wit, Cape, Duce, Moutil, Mara, Seke. Each of these are much of the same bigness with our Isle of Walcheren: the Ayr and Clymate, as it is most fit for the producing and ripening fruits, so is it very tedious to humane Bodies, by reason of the Vapours exhaled by the Sun, which is almost perpendi∣cular to them; for these Lands lying just under the Equator, having their very entrails scorched, needs must the surface thereof be inflamed.
The Chinoys about the Year of Christ, One Thousand and Thirteen, being scattered far and wide over the Indies, pos∣sessed these Islands, but not without great expense and blood; whereof at last being weary, they retired themselves more inwardly, leaving those places, whose Possession they had en∣joyed threescore years; after these, some out of the Coun∣try of Malucca, came and seated there, who being driven away, the Arabians mixt with Persians, succeeded them, who brought in with them Mahometisme, a long time mixt with increasing superstitions, and by little and little also separated from them: Nor from any other Fountain sprung their Name; for the Arabians called them the Kingdom of the Moluccaes: From the same, they took the name of their Kings, calling them Sultans, and several other words by them used: These Islands were altogether unknown to the antient Greeks and Romans, unless they may seem to be in∣cluded under the name of Chinoys, or among the Islands first found by Jambulus, whom Diodorus Siculus commemorates: But the Merchandise of Cloves, they enjoyed by the People of the East; and because being increased, it passed with Egypt to the Ptolomean Kings, and afterwards, to those that succeeded them in their power and greatness, the Romans had their Tribute of the same. But the Roman Empire de∣creasing, first the Genowayes, and after them the Venetians: together with Cassa, obtained these. And when Constan∣tinople fell to the Latine or West Empire: and the Greekish envy chose among these Trebizond, for a new Seat of an∣other Empire, the Trade was drawn thither through the Cas∣pian Sea, by a way not so much used, as known to the Ro∣mans of old, as Pliny teacheth us out of Varro; and after∣wards, the Turks Power encreasing thereabout, it was car∣ryed thence by Camells, and Dromedaries to Aleppo: But the Sultans that possessed Caire, restored it again to the Red Sea, and Alexandria: After this, the Portugueses having searched many parts of Africa and Asia, and planted Colo∣nies
in the Year One Thousand Five Hundred and Twelve, came to these Islands, whereby force and Arms prevailing, partly by the differences of the Kings there, and partly by the strengh of their Shipping, easily made themselves Lords of the Trade of Cloves, spoyling and destroying all Ships, that by chance at any time came thither, either from Persia or Arabia, and stopping up all the passages into Egypt. Thus did the Sultans loe no less than the yearly Revenew of fourscore Thousand Ducats. At that time, the King of Ternata, was Boloif, the Son of rgeo, who was looked upon among his Subjects, as a Pro∣phet, the King of Tideris was Almansor; these were at va∣riance between themselves a long time, only out of a desire of increasing Dominion, which was the Original, and cause of their slavery: The Portugueses preferred the friendship of him of Ternata, as having the larger Government; and as if they believed any thing lawful to be done against Maho∣mitans, they poysoned Almansor, disobeying their Com∣mand; for which cause, his Son and Heir Raxamira, sub∣mitted himself to the obedience of the Castilians, who eight years after, publickly came into those parts, as if with an in∣tent to take possession thereof, averting, that their Ancestors and Magellane, had discovered those places before the Por∣tugueses; and besides, they so interpreted the method of dividing the World, and the several positions of places with such incertain dimensions, that they would include these places within the bounds of their Empire: Hence it came, that when those two distinct People, Spaniards and Barba∣rians, were intermingled, they had sharp, but no long con∣flicts: because the Emperour Charles the Fifth who Reigned in Castile, wanting money, and not rightly understanding of what great concernment the matter in agitation was: ac∣cepting from John the Third King of Portugall, Three Hun∣dred and Fifty Thousand Duckets, He pawned to Him, all His Right in the Mollucca's: from whence the Portugueses
have since claimed a free Trade there, without interruption, sending all their Cloves to Goa, from whence the Persians, Turks, Chinoys and Africans, fetched them; yet scarcely so much by a third part, as is vended to the European Nati∣ons. Therefore it was no wonder, that out of the Molucca Islands, and Amboyna, which is not far distant, and brings forth the same Fruit and Banda, where the best Nutmegs grow, which bears a Flower that is called Mace, the Kings of Portugalls had a yearly Revenew of Two Hundred Thou∣sand Duckats. Pepper and Ginger growing every where, are esteemed vile to these; so also is Cinamon. Now as the Wealth of these barbarous Kings increased, so also did the injuries offered to them: for that which at first was but an allyance, after became, and was turned into publick Tyranny; and what before was the Obligation to Fidelity, now was converted into designs of Treachery. After the Death of Bolcif, his Son Bajan, that succeeded Him in the Kingdom was taken Prisoner, and after Him, his Brother, and King Dayall. These by some means or other being dead, one Arrias took the Kingdom, who also was Himself first Imprisoned, and afterwards slain, for no cause, but out of envy to His greatness; for He was unspotted in His Fidelity: insomuch, that many Islands about, which had formerly been Governed by the Noblemen, in admiration of His Vertues, submitted themselves to His Government: so that He had under His Command, above seventy Isles, and no small parts of the Celebes Country, Mindanao and Gilolo. His two Elder Sons were so terrified with that sad Example, that they refused the Name of King, and so escaped the danger. The Third named Babus, ventured to take the Crown, and promising to revenge the former facts, it was admirable, to see how much Affection both His Subjects and Neighbours shewed to him: In His Reign, the English first came out of Europe, under the Conduct of Captain Drake, in the Year,
One Thousand Five Hundred Seventy and Nine, and distur∣bed the Possession of the Portugueses: Babus expected ayd a long time from these; but being frustrate of His hopes, and the Courages of the Barbarians beginning, as is usual, by little and little to languish; and hearing that the Wealth both of Castile and Portugall, were united in King Philip, He sent some to him, to excuse the revenge He had taken for His Fathers murther; and promised for the future, Faith and Obedience: But he was eluded with ambiguous Answers, til soon after dying, together with the Kingdom, He left to His Brother Zaida, instead of hopes of Paron, His ha∣tred against the Spaniards, ready to burst out upon any occa∣sion given. There was also one Molee, who after Raamira, Suc∣ceeded His Father Guna, (slain by Zaida) and his Brother Gapabaguna (uncertain by whom poysoned) in the Go∣vernment of Tyderis, who to oblige the Portugueses, by good Offices, was envious of their adversaries: These were they the Hollanders found, when first, as we have before related, they came into that World. In the Year One Thousand Six Hundred, Zaida first with joy beheld the Hollanders Arms, able to cope with the Por∣tugall Power, against whom He joyned with the other, with so much Courage, that He not only defied the Spaniards as Enemies; but slighted the English, who desired Commerce and Trade with them; but calling the Hollanders his Al∣lyes, and Confederates, and the deliverers both of Himself and the Sea, from tyrannous oppressions: On the other side, the King of Tyderis permitted the Portugueses to Erect a Castle in their Territories: And before Cornelius Sebastian came thither, the English once more arrived there with their Ships, boasting to the Portugueses, That there was a Peace between Spain and England; They that accounted all Foreigners Enemies, yet then counterfeited Friendship to the English, al∣though
the fear of the Hollanders was more prevalent; Nor was gain onely diminished by these, and the number of Merchants les∣sened; but the English resisted them that prepared for War against Tyderis, that they might sell Gunpowder to the Portu∣galls, by the scarcity whereof, they were much pinched; but by perseverance in Counsell, it was agreed between Zaida and the Hollanders, that He should only make a shew of War, while they brought over their Army into the Island of Tyderis: That the Hollanders only should perform the Assault of the Castle, because the Barbarians are carryed  rather by fury than advice; and being once broken off, suddenly loose all their Courage; The Marriners therefore first of all climb up and assault two Caracks lying near the Bay, then setting fire on some small Villages. All the great Guns, both from the Ships at Land, were levelled at the Castle; but afterwards, Captain Molly, looking at the mat∣ter nearer hand, reported, that there was a passage through the ruines; whereupon, they violently run on, and though beaten back both by shot and fire thrown among them yet they came on afresh; Then did Molly, seeing one Torry a Spaniard, rushing upon him with a Javelin, gently avoiding the stroke, catch him in his Arms, so that they both fell down together upon the ground: where as they lay strugling, he called to his next Associate, bidding him to shoot the Spaniard in the Head while he held him in his Arms striving, which was presently dne yet, but seven being able to get into the Castle, they were forced to Retreat, in which, Captain Molly being found with his Thigh broken, was by his Companions carryed off, though a long time he resisted it, crying out, that they should again, and with greater valour, assayl their Enemies, their care of him at present, being to no purpose: for if they took the Castle, they might relieve and take him up at their pleasure; when by chance, a Tower, wherein was a quantity of Gunpowder being shot with a Bullet, the Powder took fire, and destroyed threescore Portugueses: In which affright, the As∣saylants afresh coming on, took the Castle The Women and
Children fled into the Rocks, which were unpasseable by Armed men; but all Victuals and Water being stopped from them, they were forced to yield, and together with the men that sur∣vived the taking of the Castle, were transported into the Phi∣lippines. Thus were the Portugalls driven from their Dominion in the Molucca's, save only they had yet one small Fort in the Island Timosa. The Hollanders gave not only the King of Tideris his life, but granted him all his power, lead thereto rather for their Honours, than Securities sake. But He, dissembling amity with the Hollanders, made a League with the King of Ternata, having no other hopes, and then con∣tinually laid plots, which in time he hoped to bring to pass, desiring in the interim, as the best means to secure the liberty of the Island, that the Castle might he demo∣lished, which ought rather to have been kept up and aug∣mented. At this time also, other Ships returned from the Indies, which had been sent thither by several Merchants, before they were united into one Company: nor did they come without good booty; for they had intercepted a Carack coming from Machao, at the Island Patany, which then a Woman Governed, who maintaining, that the spoyls taken in Her Kingdom belonged to her, made the Hollanders di∣vide the prey with Her, which afterwards they redeemed again. Part of the Indian Commodities, especially Silk, is brought out of China, a potent and flourishing Empire, where it hath ever been esteemed a part of Prudence, to forbid an entrance to strangers; and the Portugalls residing at the utmost Borders thereof, by many Policies, affrighted that suspicious People, advising them not to admit the Hol∣landers, who were valiant and powerful at Sea, to come within their Borders: but while by the favour of Neighbour
Kings, a harmless Voyage was sued fot, in the interim, by the Merchants of China, that frequented Java, and other places, they participated of the same Commerce. More∣over, the Hollanders sent to the Indies, Paul Carden, with Eight Ships, the Ninh by chance, being burned before it went out: And lest their Neighbours should seek to con∣vert to their own uses, that Commerce which they had got∣ten with so much labour, and defended in the uttermost parts of Asia, the United States did by an Edict declare, That no Native of Inhabitant should go into those parts, either from home, or out of other Lands, except such as were Commanded by the Indian Company, lately erected in Holland, wherein all Objections were answered by the necessity thereof, and the like Ex∣ample: and afterwards, in following times, the same Com∣pany was much augmented by new Cautions, and severe punish∣ments against offenders, as any deceitful practices were de∣tected. This Year were Celebrated some Solemn Funerals; as of Philip Hohenlo, one of the Noble Persons among the Hollanders, who dyed among them, and of John of Nassau, who deceased in Germany. Hohenlo was a Man, well skilled in War, and of an un∣daunted Resolution; but of no great fore-sight in Com∣mand, although during Prince Maurice's Youth, he was wont to lead the Forces; but when he saw by the Princes maturity, that there was no use of Him, at length, partly with grief and trouble of mind, and partly by the Gout, caused by two much repletion, he had a slow and lingring death, which is very grievous to a valiant mind. But Nassau dyed of old Age, he was Brother to William Prince of Aurange, and with Him shared the antient Inhe∣ritance of his Predecessors: the Prince enjoying all in France and the Netherlands, and He what belonged to their Family in Germany.
He assisted his Brother with Money, while the necessity of his Affairs required it; and in the greatest distraction of his business, he was not wanting in Counsel. He was for a time, Governour of Gelderland, and the chief Authour of the Trajectine League, which was in its time, exceedingly necessary. Afterwards, returning to his own Patrimony, he was a continual Assistant to his Sons, supporting by Arms, his Allyes and Friends, of whom, Count William Governing the Frizons, and Count Ernest, about that time, marryed to the Duke of Brunswicks Daughter, only survived; the Counts, Philip and Lewis, dyed in the War; nor was his Off-spring at home, any whit less, of either Sex. Now also dyed Justus Lipsius, a Man famons for Learn∣ing, among the Noblest Wits, after he had obtained great Renown from the Precepts of Wisdom, and the Roman Gravity; and also from a new and concise kind of writing, perpetuated the same, in his publick Narrations of Halle, and Aspricoll. And whether He deferred, or contemned to an∣swer those Books set out against him, his Death so soon fol∣lowing, hath left questionable: however, as well the Hollan∣ders as the Netherlanders, did not omit to Celebrate the me∣mory of this worthy Person, both in Verses, and publick Orations. About this time also, was a Marriage in the Nassavian Family, Solemnized, between PHILIP Prince of AURANGE, and a Virgin Daughter of the Prince of CONDE, of the BORBONIAN Stock, by which Affinity, the KING, as Obliged to Him, re∣stored the free Possession of the Town and Principality of AURANGE, although the PARLIAMENT of DAUPHINE, averred part of the same to be subject to their Jurisdiction, and part in general to the Kingdom.
Before I begin to enter a Work disagreeing to the for∣mer discourses, I will declare how the Hollanders Affairs were turned from so sharp and long a War, unto thoughts of Peace in this year; what part of Europe was at Peace, and what at War, what private or publick motions and incli∣nations of mind among themselves or their Neighbours, when and how that time became every where as it were fatal in so great mutations, and of what advantage Forreign Affairs were to Ours, or Ours to them. The whole North, which consisted of Kingdoms of old, replete with many Priviledges and Liberties, was broken out into Arms, almost for the same causes that the Hollanders War began; for Sigismund, following the Dictates of the Jesuites, had lost Sweden, with great difficulty retaining Po∣land: For in Sweden, Charls laying aside he name of Duke, and by the Decree of his Nobles, taking the name of King, and repairing his Forces, after the loss he had received at the Siege of Riga, approached near the borders of Livonia. In Poland, Amoseius, the Chancellor of that Kingdome while he lived, had by his Wisdome, and the reverent esteem that was had of him, prevailed both with the King and Nobles for the observation of Peace, and support of the Law. But when he was dead, first discontents and hatred arose, which afterwards broke out into open Force. And some there were that said, The Nobles were advised soon after his Funeral, that their Liberty had been attempted with many artisices, That he had left the Commonwealth in as good a Condition to those that survi∣ved, as it was when he first received the Charge of it; and there∣fore now They should take care that nothing therein might go a∣miss, either out of Ignorance, or Sluggishness. And in truth, not long after, the chief of the Noblemen, that are there called Palatines, broke out into Arms, accusing the King, That after the death of his first Wife, without the advice of the States of Poland, he had marryed the Sister of his deceased Wife, thereby at once polluting the Kingdome with Incest,
and by a private League obliging himself to the House of Austria, and that in the disposal of Honours, he carried not an equal hand, but preferred Romanists before Protestants; they desired also that the Jesuits might be expelled out of the Jurisdiction of Craovia, and that the contentions grow∣ing among Priests should be decided by Domestique Jud∣ges, and not at Rome, whither they must make long Journies with vast charge. And thereupon the Great Council of that Kingdome being summoned, they called the King be∣fore them, to purge himself of his Crimes, adding threats, That unless he appeared, they would transfer those Imperial En∣sign of Majesty, the Crown and Scepter, which by the Custome of the Countrey they had the keeping of, to another. But the King, collecting his Army, and winning to him many by gifts, al∣though at first he was answered with divers successes, yet pre∣ferring Peace, a League was concluded at Sendomir, whereby the Old Laws were strengthened and confirmed by New. But for all this, it might rather he called a laying down of Arms, then a taking awy of Offences; for as he contem∣ned the Subjects as Conquered, so their impunity made them again grow confident, so that the Peace was neither safe nor durable. Besides these faults before mentioned, this also was objected, That without the consent of the Publick, he in∣tangled Poland in a war, by sending aid to Demetrius. This Demetrius (after Boris had invaded the Dominion, sought to slay the Son of the most noted Basilides by cruelty, and after him enjoyed Muscovy) professing himself the Brother of The∣odore, another being put into his place that should be killed while he was carryed into Poland, where he long dissembled the Nobility of his bloud, but at last prevailed in the over-perswading many by shewing upon his body divers private marks. But he managed his Arms unfortunately against Boris, who was now grown old and experienced both in the Arts of War, and Government. When he dyed, he left a son named Theodore, whom we mentioned before in his ten∣der
age to be left to his Mother, but a great part of the Russi∣ans, who equally hate the Government of Women and Chil∣dren, fell to Demetrius, and presently the common people let him into Mosco the Principal City, slaying in favour of their new Lord, both the Widow and Son of Boris. But the Fortune of his Kingdome was short, for the Priests were of∣fended at the Authority of the Jesuites, by whose perswasi∣ons it was reported, That he had sent to the Pope with in∣tent to change the Greek Ceremonies for the Latine. Nor were the Noblemen less enraged, because he chose for the Guards to his person, Foreiners, and made use of none but Polanders, both in his Court, and Privy Counsels. But the common people, who hate or love, not voluntarily, but as they are lead and instructed, were provoked by common re∣port, That he was not the Demetrius as was supposed, but a Fugitive Monk, instructed by Magick Art, and but a slave sent by the Polanders to disturb the Affairs of Russia. At the time of his Marriage, which he celebrated with a young Polonian Lady, the daughter of the Palatine of Sendomer, a great tumult arising, Demetrius, or whoever else he was (for even after his death it remained a doubt) in vain striving to avoid his ruine, by leaping from on high to the ground, being weakned by the fall, he was presently killed. And his death was attended with a great slaughter of Polonians, while one Scutskye, that had raised this commotion, seized the Em∣pire, at first indeed very unstable and tottering, while their minds were astonished with the cruelty, and being very slowly drawn to consent to a new Prince, but afterwards it was soon setled by fear add punishments, as is usual among Barbarians. Now also had the sedition of the Imperial Souldiers invol∣ved Transilvania, and the parts adjoyning upon Hungary in great troubles, which were also increased by the Rapines of the Governours, and debarring the Protestants the liberty of their Religion, the envy of the War here also being thrown
upon the Jesuits, as the daily fomenters of mischief. At this time also broke forth divers long concealed complaints, That they plainly saw they were slighted, for the Prince violated that antient Custome of his Predecessors, of being present in their Assemblies, and hearing the Requests of his People. But Ro∣bolfus keeping himself within the Court, kept the chief ma∣agety both of Arms and Counsels in the hands of Forein∣ers which is a thing very grievous, even to such as are en∣slaved, and therefore the more intollerable to them, whose Laws and Foundations of Government, are so confirmed to them by the Oaths of their Kings, that it is accounted to them, neither disgrace of Crime to resist all that would make an infringement thereupon. And thus on a sudden, they fell to fighting and besieging of Cities, to the great re∣joycing of the Turk, from whom the Crown and Scepter of Hungary was sent to Steplxn Botscay, a chosen Captain of the Malecontents, who was, besides the Publick, inflamed with private injuries, yet he persisted to refuse the same, con∣tenting himself with Transilvania, and the Title of Prince. But Peace set an end to this short War, of which this was the third year. The Turk being weakned by the Persians Victories, and a new Rebellion in Asia, and Botscay endeavouring nothing further then the preservation of Liberty. The Emperour Ro∣bolfus, being too weak for two Enemies, Granted Transil∣vania to Botscay, and to the Hungarians, Native Governours of their own, appointing his Brother Matthias, who had been heretofore concerned in the Low-Countrey Affairs, their Regent, and setling Laws, whereby the Jesuites Wealth should be restrained, and agreeing the Turk should keep what he possessed. Thus Arms being laid aside, Botscay not long after was poisoned by some about him, yet even at his last gasp, when he despaired of life, taking care for the Pub∣lick; Commending to the Hungarians and Transylvanians, a strict Unity and Concord, frequent Assemblies in Counsel, and
while the Laws remained in force, to hold a firm Peace with Cae∣sar. But his dying without Issue, when by the Laws, the Principality reverted to the Emperour, straight was Transyl∣vania involved in new troubles, impatient to be ruled by a Forreign Prince. Germany also was now full of differences concerning Religion; and at Brunswick, Patelborn, Embden, although they had not an absolute War, yet their differen∣ces came as near to a War as might be, between those Prin∣ces and Cities, the former being too greedy of Dominion, and the later unapt and unwilling to obey. The Venetians yet defended themselves by Books, whose Authors at the prescribed day, wont not to Rome, pretending many casualties in the Journey, and that their nominated Judges were malicious against them, in the interim, Com∣manders, Armies, and Fleets, were with all expedition hast∣ned forward. Nor did the Spaniard dissemble in promising the Pope aid, whereof the King of France having notice, sent to Rome, to tell his Holiness, That his Ancestors had so well merited of that See, that in all dangers the Church ought not to seek redress from any other hands then those of the Kings of France; but if the Pope should declare himself ambitious to di∣late the Spanish Greatness, He ought with great reason to suspect the same, and therefore in a manner should be compelled to take part against him. With these threats the Italian was terrifi∣ed, whose Countrey was never pierced with Forreign Arms without great damage, because the Body of the Countrey being divided into small Dominions, would easily become a prey to the Conqueror. But the French, as he feared not War too much, yet he rather chose Peace; Wherefore now He advised the Venetians, then the Pope. That they would re∣concile their Differences, which otherwise would break out to the Publick Ruine. Himself strengthening and corrobora∣ting His Domestique quiet, both by Laws, Money, and League.
Brittain, after the Discovery of that Horrid Conspiracy for∣merly mention'd, was full of Jealousies and Suspitions, which the Pope increased, by setting forth Bulls, Forbidding  to take the Oath prescribed by the King, maintaining, that it was contrary to Religion, because they swore thereby to continue faith and Allegiance to the King, though the Pope denyed it, which the Catholikes themselves very hardly believed. And this Declaration of the Pope's, was receiv'd with great variety of Opinion; as, Either the Love of the Country, or the imbibed Principles of Religion prevail'd with every one. The English also made many Complaints, because Right was not equally admini∣stered to the Merchants in Spain. But in Spain the Netherlan∣ders there abiding, were with great Cruelty persecuted, whose Trade with the Hollanders, and chiefly with the late rected Indian Company was connexed: The Treasury also was taken Care for with great Diligence; all whose Fideli∣ty, in managing the Affairs of Money, was suspected, being apprehended and call'd to Question. But the Remedies were too small for such overgrowing Evils; although the King was daily pressed with Petitions of the Portugezes, That he would not please to set an end to their Misery, For why would he suffer  near at hand to be exhausted and spoiled, while he onely ded the War with the Hollanders at a greater distance? Why would he permit so many Ships, the onely Wealth of that late flou∣rishing Kingdom, to be taken and burned? The Ports of Spain  to be beset, and now the Molucca's to be torn from him: Be∣sides the War made by the Castilians was very burdensom, which ing the late Times, had cost the Spaniard no less than Three Hundred Thousand Scutes Monethly, without any hope of an ; and especially, because the danger of the Ships coming from America grew greater and greater? The Expences moreover, had so far increased over the Annual Income, that the Seditions of the Souldiers could not be avoided, even by the exactest Care and Diligence of Spinola; and what was gotten by the War, did in no wise tantamount; it being on the other side known by Expe∣rience,
how firmly the Enemies had fortified their Rivers, d strengthned their Works; how secure they keep their Sea, d how uncertain and letigious the Passage of our Souldiers hath been through the Borders of other Dominions; so that if the Venetian War should grow on, the Belgick not yet ended, it must needs re∣duce Us, not onely to Poverty, but to absolute Beggery. The King was a young man, unexperienced in Matters of War, and who measur'd rather the Greatness of his Kingly Dignity, by the Excess of his Pleasures, than the Extents of his Dominions; unless he was drawn thereto by Advice, was not very forward to ingage in a War: Besides, He was pos∣sessed with great Fears, by an addition and intermixture of Truth and Falshood, not without great Policy of those who had the chief Management of Affairs in Holland, that they might drive Spain, of it self full of Procrastinations, into more speedy and reall Motions for Peace: For a Rumour was spread abroad, That the French King strongly labour'd, to  the Hollanders to become Subjects to his Kingdom, under s prescribed Laws, and that Flanders, being Conquer'd, should be the Bounds between them. But it was more tolerable for the Spa∣niards to give the Hollanders their Liberty, than by the Da∣mage of his own Empire, to increase that of another, and him espe∣cially his chief Emulator; and some hope yet remained against them, when they should have nothing to do, either by forgetfulness of Offences, by Discord among themselves, or with the Kings, by whose Wealth they flourished, which would for ever be lost, if they were employed. Besides, Fortune favouring them in the Indies, a New Company was prepar'd by the Hollanders and Zelan∣ders, that should with a strong Fleet carry, at once, both War and Merchandise into America, and should drive away thence the Enemy both by Sea and Land, with hope of as great Booty, as would make amends for the Charge of the War. Anon after, another Report was spread abroad, That, as formerly, the Turk had passed the Hellespont, by the help of the Genoways; so now the Moors were, by the Hollanders Assistance and Fleet,
gain Granado, and other places, possessed by their Ancestors. Albertus also, and Isabella; this, as a Woman; that, as a Man,  up in Religious Studies, began now to be weary of the War,  burthensom to them by its long continuance: And the Peo∣ple Sighs and Tears, together with want, and the often renewed Seditions of the Souldiers prevailed, that now they chose rather a obtain and peaceable Government, than the hope of an inlarged Dominion attended with continual Fear. But Spinola was the chief Author of that Counsel, who a few years, having archiev'd great Honour, fear'd, lest For∣tune should turn Retrograde, both his own, and the King's Credit, being at once shipwrack'd, if these vast Charges should continue, or any Chance should intercept the Ameri∣ Revenues, without any hope of recovering what he had bursed; so that being overwhelm'd in Debt, in stead of a ear and honourable Fortune, he could see nothing but ame and Poverty. But, in the Ʋnited Provinces, few durst hope for Peace, but rather most fear'd it, being so instructed from their Parents, that all Treaties with a deceitful Enemy were to be shun∣ed, and that War was most safe under whatsoever Qualifi∣cation; and that the great Number of Men subject to them,  well Souldiers, as the rest of the Common People, were advantaged by Arms, Engines, Armies, and Fleets: Nor was it fear'd by a few, least, as formerly, at the beginning of the War, so now at the restoring of Peace, Antwerp should be chosen as the most commodious Seat for Merchandise and Traffick: And when all fear of the Enemy should be taken away, the Dissentions of Cities, and other Disturban∣ces of the Common-wealth were dreaded. Nor were there some wanting, especially among those that were more sub∣ject to Danger, as lying nearer the Enemy; who, long since, while they saw Cities taken by force, and none to contradict it; and that under a shew of Prudence, their Limits were lessned, fearing the like might happen to them, when it
would be too late to seek a Remedy, altogether bent their whole studies for Peace. But the more Moderate, as they thought fit to avoid Treacheries, so they likewise agreed to try, Whether Arms might be laid aside upon Honourable Terms, with the safety of the Commonwealth, and preservation of Religion: Nor was this time to be omitted, when the Ene∣mies Affairs were decaying, the Authority of the States was grown more firm by long Obedience, and there were two potent Princes as it were at their sides; the one offended at the Spaniard; the other, for many just Reasons displeased with the Pope, and therefore would consequently be more cordial to the Hollanders. The state of Affairs, both at Home and abroad, being in this condition, Herman Wittenhorsten, by the Arch-Duke's Com∣mand, came to the Hagne about the end of the year. The same also, before the Armies should march out, in the Spring had passed through Gelderland and Holland, but with Com∣mand onely to commune in private, whereof there would be occasion enough given him, in regard he was allyed to seve∣ral of the Holland Nobility, either by the Consanguinity of his Ancestors, or other Collateral Affinity of Marriages. But now John Genard the Secretary, coming to accompany him from Turnholt (where both of them lived, and that place pay∣ing Tribute to both Parties, caused them to have the more free admittance) He deliver'd to the chief of the States, what he had in Command from Albertus and Isabella, which was to this effect: That nothing was more desired by them than the Peoples Peace, and that an end might be put to their long and bloo∣dy Troubles: That the Rights belonging to the Arch-Dukes were not unknown to the States, as also that they sought not anything that belonged to others: They, on the other side, should consider, what they conceived fit for confirming their Security, whether a Peace or a Truce onely; and that it was left to them, whether they would chuse a publike or a private Treaty; from which all un∣just and treacherous Dealings should be banish'd.
But the matter was deferred, because they brought no Letters from the Arch-Dukes to the States: We shall here∣after relate with care what gradations and progress it had, and with what inclination it was managed, because this will  far more expedient for the knowledg of Citizens, than the Arts of Fortifications, or Excursions of Horse; and Foreign Nations at no time before had spoken of the Hol∣landers with more Honour and Renown. The Sixteenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 7.THE Winter growing more warm, yet very turbulent with high Winds, as it made the Hol∣landers secure from their Enemies Incursions, yet hindred not the flowing of the Rivers, as if the Heavens had been pleased with the overtures of Peace, nevertheless, it did same harm in another part, by spoyling some Ships near the Texell, because the Island was unsafe for Winter stations, which Ships were thereby forced to delay the time of their going out into several parts of the World: But the Ʋnited States, that they might with the more certainty settle do∣mestick Peace, and vindicate their fame, after Time had cared their late grown Troubles of Groeninge, taken off the necessity of imperious Command, and reduced their minds  a conformity of obedience, commanded the Castle, which they had built to keep the City in awe, to be demolished and pulled down, which though formerly it was necessary, yet now if it should be continued, would not at all suit with
the Liberty which they pretended towards all. The chief cause of this their so great security was, That the Magistrates of the City were such, whose fidelity both to them and the publike Religion was well known, and a great Garrison was kept therein without charge, and without regret. Yet for all this, had the Souldiers no time of leisure, for the Spaniard broke into and burned a small Fort in the Isle of Bommell, the Sentinell being hired by them to hold his peace. The Captain that Commanded the place was slain, who was bla∣med for this, because in not changing his Watches, he had given hopes to that Treacherous Design. Also the Count Bruyke, a younger Brother, but in pay under the Hollanders, as he rid to his Father's house with a small retinue, fell into an ambush of the Enemies: his Se∣cretary by chance going before, was shot, which was a sign of what was following to his Master; yet he did not offer to fly, but valiantly coped with the Enemy, not out of hope to escape, but because he was ashamed to be taken. After he was slain, his body was barbarously wounded; the for∣tune and hatred which they bore towards his Father, being executed upon the Son: for with the like barbarism was his Father killed by Mendosa's Souldiers. But Henry of Nassau going out with a strong Party of Horse to the spoyl of Spinola's men, that carelessly Wintered in the Country of Limburg, when they, hearing of the dan∣ger, retired into the Cities. He took by force Erkelen, a Town lying in his way, after he had beaten down the Gate with a Petard. This is a small Town in Gelderland, which out of a sense of its own weakness, had of old paid Tribute to both parties: But then by chance was become an Enemy to the Hollanders, by receiving Count Henry of Heremberg, who had chosen that place as a fit Seat to go a foraging. Fifty Horse were slain within, the rest of the Garrison was absent: Count Heremberge himself was taken; what they
could they carried away, the rest they burned: The sury of the Souldiers was more fierce, than could be restrained by the authority of their Captain; for that they remembred the d usage of some of their Companions in that place. But Frederick Count Heremberg, to make amends for his Bro∣ther's more hard fortune, resolved to invade Ardenburg in Flanders, a Town fortified by the Hollanders, to which de∣sign of his, some of the Souldiers within were conscious. But part of them being for some Crimes called in question and imprisoned, confessed the unknown Plot, which was then ready to be put in execution; for Count Frederick wai∣ted in a place hard by with a strong party, expecting a sign from the Traytors. Some long Voyages were joyntly by the Hollanders and the English hastned forward: for this Spring the Hollanders for Two Ships, and the English Three, towards the Indies: At the present the English made the greater gain, but their Honour was drawn in question: for of late, Edward Michel∣ returning out of that World, was reported to have in∣damaged Commerce by Slaughters and Rapines committed upon the Barbarians, but he threw the fault upon the Indians, to man gainsaying the Reasons he gave for the same. Nor did there want some, who encouraged to the like audacious attempts, averring it was so directed by the Customs and Laws of their Ancestors, because whatever was committed against Foreiners, with whom no publike League was made, was justified so far in Britain, as there could be no compensation got for any injury done. At this time, It was in agitation, that the Spaniard alone might not wholly pos∣sess America: for the English a good while since claimed to themselves a part thereof in the Thirty fourth degree from the Equinoctial, which they named Virginia, in honour of Queen Elizabeth; which name it still retains. This they claimed, because they were the first that had searched into the inner part of the Country. Wherefore such assembling,
whose Money being not employed at home, yet hoped good advantage from abroad, erected Two Companies, to each of which particular Colonies were designed in those parts: And King James settled Laws and Rewards among them for the augmentation of the Brittish glory: And it was confidently affirmed, That there were Mines of Gold and Silver; which was credulously believed, as mens covetous∣ness wished the same. This great business received its be∣ginning from one Ship, whose Passengers having built a sleight Fort on the Bank of a River which they found, by whose Fish, and the Fruits of the adjoyning Country, they could well maintain themselves: They that were lost there in Garrison, the Natives gathering against them, retreated more towards the side of the Country: But another Spanish Ship falling into their hands, they would not spare the Sea∣men, because leaving at home Peace and Justice, they kept the vast possession of the New World, only by terrour: Moreover, some Britains lately went to Guyana, but a Sedi∣tion arising in the Voyage, and the Ship being lost, part of the Company remained in the Island, where continually vexing the Barbarians with injutious usage, they at last were set upon by War as Enemies, by force of which, and the want of Victualls, they committed themselves to the Sea in a Boat made onely of an Hollowed Tree; there for the space of ten dayes together, being tossed with continual Tempests, and thrown upon the rocks, they very hardly got to the Land; where their danger was no whit lessened, for they were taken by the Spaniard, who for all that pardoned them, in regard they came not to those Parts of their own accord, but by the stress of weather. But the Hollanders Designs ran at a higher pitch, yet went but slowly on, according to the custome of great Underta∣kings: Heretofore, there was a great number of Merchants, a vast multitude of Sea-men, and besides, then was there so much money, as is scarcely to be believed, in private mens
hands unimployed, by the Loss of the Spanish Trade, (the East-Indies not being sufficient) Only America seemed to be able to give this satisfaction, which every where abounds with Mines, besides Salt and Sugar, pretious Wood, and Physical Drugs. But the Spaniards prepossessing all the Principal Coasts, cut off all hope of Commerce by Traffick, wherefore by the Publike, strength and authority being added to the Private wealth: And now the wealthiest, as well Merchants as others, who out of a zeal to benefit their Country, had inquired into all things in that New World, both from Books, and also the relations of Sea-men, pub∣lished a form of Government and Laws for a new Society, that should continue for the space of Six and Thirty Years: And it should not be lawful for any of their Citizens, un∣less he became a Member of that Company, to go into those Parts, which extend from Terra-Nova, well known to the French Fisher-men, by a vast Tract of Land all along the streights of Magellan, unto the Ocean on both sides, and whatever lyes opposite to the Coasts of Africa, between the Equinoctial and the Cape of Good Hope. Five Moneths were limited for the bringing in of Money: And for the first Six years, the Ʋnited States would add Two hundred thousand Florens yearly, and afterwards as much more, as the Affairs of the Commonwealth would permit; That the Accounts of Warr and Traffick should be reckoned sepa∣rately: That for the carrying on of Warr, there should be Sixteen stout Ships, and four Barks, set out by Private Men; and the like number by the Commonwealth; But how many soever were furnished with Souldiers by the Company, they together with all the rest should be under one Command. That the Stock should be managed in this manner by the Governours; Thirty of Amsterdam should have the dispo∣sal of the one half thereof: Eighteen in Zeland of a Fourth part: In West-Friezeland, and at the Mouth of the Maes, Fif∣teen should manage the rest. Nor was their Power perpe∣tual,
but every Sixth year, the Third part of these Governors were to give way to Successors: That none should be cho∣sen to that Office, but such as had been most liberal in bring∣ing Money into the Stock. In the judgment of these men lay the ordering of all Af∣fairs, both as to Merchandise, and War. The hundreth part was designed as the reward of the labour of all that either Exported or Imported, and the gain arising from the Im∣provement of the Stock, should be divided when it was e∣qual to the tenth part of the Stock. Whatever should be ta∣ken as Prize, was to be disposed according to the determina∣tion of the Judges of the Admiralty, but for the first six years the same should remain undivided, that the Charges of the War might be sustained by the Profits gotten by it. And afterwards the tenth part should be brought to the Treasury of the United States, Prince Maurice should have a thirtieth part, and the Merchants to enjoy the rest. That four being selected out of the aforesaid numbers of Governours, should equally with the seventeen have the managery of the Chief Affairs of State. The Governors and Commanders sent by these, being sworn to the States, should do Justice, build Forts, and make Leagues, as they should see convenient. That at their return home, they should deliver to the Uni∣ted States, exact relations of all things done by them; That all their Merchandises should be free from the Customes or Tributes which were setled of Old, for ever, and from the other lately invented, and set up by occasion of the Wars, during twenty years. The Authors and drivers on of this notable Design and Policy, flattring themselves, as every mans humour led him, (and hopes being once let loose, will quickly spread them∣selves to an immensity that will hardly be circumscribed) dis∣coursed both in Speeches and Books, that hitherto that most potent part of the Enemies Dominion, would, if it were at∣taqued by Arms, become the weakest. And thus the War
should be carried to Sea, in which kind of Fights, the Hollan∣ders were never overcome by all the strength of the Enemies ces, even when they exceeded them very far in number;  by how much the Voyage was longer, by so much was the more difficult to them, whose tender joints would not  able to endure the heat, in regard of whom, their Norther∣ habitations, and Countrey lying in the Sea, had with spa∣ce undergone all the greatest discommodities; That the uttermost parts of America, which extend to both the Poles, hath been so little frequented, as it is scarcely known; for  Trinity Isle, even to the Equinoctial, the whole Coast avoid, and without a Lord. In the rest of the Countrey at Spanish Garrisons scatteredly lying up and down, but with such distances, that they can neither help one another, at defend any that lay between them. Now if Arms were made use of, they would quickly become Masters, and should him by experience, that there would be as many Enemies against the Spaniard, as there were several people in those Countreys, who would be more faithful to them by the memory of their old cruelty, and the continuance of their most terrible slavery, than if they were hired for money. Now they durst promise themselves the same Greatness, which had made the Spaniard formidable, and that the glory of that Warfare would certainly be perpetual, because dan∣ger being removed from them, they would not fear by a rare example to admit any Enemy that durst hazard the Peace of their Dominion. Nor would this be a small kind∣ness to Mankind in general, that they had propagated Chri∣stian Religion among ignorant Nations, or such as at the best had been led out of one error into another, with much more sincerity and pureness. On the other side, divers affirmed. That the chance of War was various, That the Sea would admit of all, yet there was no War more uncertain and dangerous then one at Sea. If it liked to remember the Athenians, whose most flourishing
City had fallen by one such temerity, yet they should call to mind, the unfortunate success of the Fleet they had lately sent out under the command of Peter Douse. Tis true, they had conquered the Spaniards in divers Naval Fights: but the Hollanders themselves at the beginning of the War, were unexperienced in Land-service, wherein, if by care and time they were grown more exact, why may it not be feared, but that the Enemy might likewise grow more skilful in Sea Af∣fairs. Sometimes even the Conquered by frequent slaugh∣ters, have arrived to such proficiency, that at last they lear∣ned to begin to Conquer, And though the people of Spain chiefly that live upon the Seacoast, are uncapable to manage Ships, yet the English and Brittons of Armoric in France, and the Saxons, are very apt and ready thereat. Nor was the confidence reasonable which the Hollanders put in their mens bodies, which though they could endure the extre∣mity of cold, yet it is indubitate and experimentally known, that by the perpetual untemperateness of the Equinoctial heat, they decay as well as others. Would Fourty Ships do that Work, and besiege that vaste and immense Ocean, where the Islands, Havens, Stations, and all other places are shut up against them, but open to the Enemy, and when there is no relief or provisions near at hand: no not so much as a sufficient quantity of fresh water? Tis true, All America is not fenced with continual Castles: But where any Wealth is contained, where any Riches lye hid, where any certain Income or Commodity attracts men, there are no sorts of Fortifications omitted. How easie will it be to land Men among so many difficulties? Where will they find a Foot Army, that should drive away the Spanish Regiments, which almost for a whole Age had been naturalized in the posses∣sion of those places? And if they should think it inconve∣nient to send thither such an Army, yet surely it would be very necessary at the same time with another Fleet to shut up the Ports of Spain, that they might not from thence send
any ayd into America: And this Office and Charge should be committed to the Merchants Forces, for the Common∣wealth cannot undertake it, being hardly able with those For∣ces home to defend its own Borders, or else by that means would run over head and ears in debt, or being denuded of Garrisons, in all likelihood run the hazard rather of losing that small Seat of their Native soyl, then by victorious arms to have sought any considerable part of that Other World: for it would be a sign of strange madness to hope the win∣ing of all; and what they shall take, they will not be able to keep: the disposition of the ayr in most places being so  wholsome, and breeding such a multitude of Diseases, that will be more contagious to the Hollanders than the Spa∣niards, because these have learned with greater measure to use meat and drink: That there is no such safety to be ex∣pected from the Barbarians society, but that they must build Forts and Castles no less against them than the Spaniards themselves: for they know no such thing as faith, nor ever heard of those other names of Vertue: They hate all strange and foreign things, Now maligning the Spaniard, and after∣wards whoever shall succeed them in Power, shall be heir to their hatred: Their dispositions are not worthy of liberty, being such as are enraged at a severe servitude, yet sleight any thing that is more mild or remiss. Are they ignorant, that among these people there were and still are Men-Eaters, thinking humane flesh the greatest dainty, and therefore every where killing all unknown persons, for no other cau∣ses of hatred, but that they are Men? Surely, the Indians and people of Asia, have a much more polite understand∣ing, and yet even there are the Hollanders compelled by many examples of treacherous dealing, to turn their Friend∣ship into a kind of Domination: Nor could any Peace or Leagues be hoped for in that New World, which is divided from its better part not so much by Scituation as Manners,
and secluded on every side by its own Ocean, as if con∣demned by Nature to the most odious barbarism. These were at that time the Discourses concerning America. Surely it concerned those who were desirous of finishing the Warr, that these hopes should not be settled too deep in the Opinions of the people: Nor was it a hard matter, to put a stop to the begun Project of the New Company, by the emulation of the Cities earnestly drawing to themselves the ordering of the Ships, and some interceding, that the Liberty of fetching Salt out of America, should not be restrained by any Law. Therefore this debate being set apart, no less difficulties were observed to hinder those that were desirous of making peace: for although the Enemies Design might chiefly be discovered, yet the Governours of the Confede∣rate Cities, from a received Opinion in the Prince of Au∣range's time, abhorred the very name of Peace: And to men of this perswasion, much appeared that would be lost, if the Enemy should openly profess himself contented with a Peace, whereby he could not regain the dominion he lost by Warr; for that which of old was accounted a part of Prudence to break off all hope of reconciliation, had no other Basis than this, That onely such a Peace could be ex∣pected, as would bring along with it an insulting Lord. On the other side, That it pertained both to the Security and Honour of the Commonwealth, if the Enemy could be drawn to a confession of their Liberty: But the War yet growing hot, and new Causes of Indignation daily arising, either Victory made them fierce, or some slaughter drew them to the desire of revenge, so that minds prepossessed, or byassed with affection, could not considerately ponder the Reasons that induced to peace: But if any Remission, or Ces∣sation should be granted of Arms, there would not be wanting some favourers of peace, which being otherwise acceptable in it self, would agree principally with the mind of the HOLLANDERS that were
earnest of Traffick; and also the people that lay next the nemy would not easily suffer themselves, having once tasted the Sweets of Peace, to be carryed back to Arms. It is a very hard thing to find the beginning of so great a ter in that Commonwealth, wherein no Affair of any great Concern is undertaken, without the Advice of the Provin∣, , and a Relation of what is done, or to be done, to the se∣veral Cities, which circuit that business; which, without doubt, was involved in great Dissentions, could not bear. They that were in the General Assembly of the United States, would not take upon them the Envy of so suddain a Muta∣, unless Prince Maurice, who was the General of the War, and famous as well by his great Merits, as the Nobility of his Extract, should become the great Author of Temporary Agreement. But He, having attained so much Honour by War, that scarcely any ever attain'd the like, and not despi∣sing the most effectual substance of Fame, and thinking with himself, that all Peace with the Spaniard was mingled with Treachery, yet was perswaded by Oldenbarnevelt (whose Authority underpropped by his Providence chiefly, and 30 years Fidelity, supported these Consultations of Peace) that as would not refuse to Treat with the Enemy: For the King of Brittain would sit by onely as a Spectator of so great a War, and the French King, by their Alliance, aimed at greater Matters, of which there were no obscure Demonstrations. If e Confederate States could find a way to lye open for them  Peace, they that supposed it advantageous to their Affairs, that the Spanish Forces should be wasted in the War of Hol∣land, might be brought to promise certain Aids, without any other account. Therefore Wittenhorst and Gevard, having receiv'd Letters from Albertus and Isabella, whereby it might appear they were intrusted, they were admitted into the Assembly of the United States, where they publickly repeated, what they had privately before spoken, highly extolling the Commodities
of Peace, before the uncertain Events of War: But because the Legates had mention'd the Arch-Dukes Right and Claim, The States thought fit to answer, That it was openly known to all who had any insight in the Belgick Affairs, that the Arch-Dukes could be helped by no pretence of Right against the Confede∣rate Provinces, but such as must be hoped to be gained by Con∣quest. In truth, when of old divers of the Provinces, after the Confirmation of their Liberty by an inviolable Decree, were united into one Body, they had sought to reduce them by Arms, being Members separated from that Body by the best and highest Right, the Equity of whose Cause, many Kings and Princes had approved by making Leagues with them. Therefore they all Resolved to persist in that Opinion, which they had lately declared to the Emperour, That a safe, pin, and just Peace could not be expected with them, who under the vain pretence of Right, would infringe the Authority of a must Reverend Decree: The Mischiefs of War would fall on both Parts, but ought to be imputed to them, that would unjustly seek what belonged to others, not those that valiantly defended their own. Wittenhorst being dismissed with this Answer, afterwards writ to the States, that he had found it to be the Arch Dukes pleasure, that in the making an Agreement, they desired to gain nothing; but that all things should remain in the same condition they were; But for the more ready carrying o of this business, the Principal of the Order of Franciscans of that Country, by Name, Francis Naya, born at Antwerp, but by Kinred, a Zelander, was made choyse of, his Father some∣times followed the Prince of Aurange, Himself was of a voluble and fluent Tongue; and though he was not igno∣rant in Court-Affairs, for he had been in Spain, and lived at Bruxells, conversant in matters of greatest importance, be∣ing of an open and free disposition, like the Netherlanders, that you will hardly suspect guilty of fraud, and by his Pro∣fession of life, armed against bashfulness, neither greatly fearing a repulse, or contumely.
This Man being sent from Bruxells, came privately to Riswicke (the next Village to the Hague) making tryall by discreet Persons, what were the main difficulties that ostructed the business: from thence being brought to the Prince, he expounded some things as he saw convenient, in Wittenhorsts Letters; and there understanding perfectly, that there was no hopes of beginning a Treaty, unless the Arch Dukes did first really own and acknowledge their Liberty, returning to Bruxells, soon after, he brought Letters from Albertus and Isabella, Signed the thirteenth of March, to this effect. That they were weary of the cruell War, and were ready to make a perpetual Peace with the United States, as free People, whom they so accounted, and against whom they would make no pretence of claym; but if they liked not such a Peace, they would if they thought good, make a Truce for twelve, fifteen, or twenty, years, or else would make a Cessation of Arms upon equall tearms, whereby as well a confident security as Commerce should be con∣firmed; with this among the rest, that what they now possessed, they should for the future retain, unless common utility induced them at any time, to exchange some Towns or Regions: That the Legates they would send to this Treaty, should be Netherlanders by Nation, to meet whom the States should send the like number;  whose appointment, they left the nomination both of time and place, for their meeting: And that these things might the more fairly proceed, They were pleased, if they would consent thereto, that there should be a Cessation of Arms, both by Sea and Land, as well among the Netherlanders as the Spaniards, during eight months: desiring the States to declare their Resolution concerning e said Treaty before the first of September. The bringing of these Letters, which they themselves a little before had drawn, those things therein being changed, which in a former Copy brought by the same Naya, had been disliked, could not but please the Hollanders: the altered oints were these, That by the Truce, each should enjoy
what they now had; but if a peace were made, then each should retain what should be agreed. Also that the Hollander should wholly abstain from going to, or Trading in the In∣dies; but in regard they judged themselves wholly Masters at Sea, and at land more powerful in their Cavallery, they thought not fit any further to forbid Hostility for eight Moneths, then that during that time, no Cities should be besieged or taken, no Countries invaded, nor any new For∣tifications built: And it was added, that the King of Spain, within three months, should ratifie the Covenants agreed to by the Arch Dukes, with the repeated recognition of the Hollanders liberty. Nay, he Promised before the four and twentieth of April, that he would bring it to pass, that those Covenants should be signed by the Arch Dukes Albertus and Isabella; so as the States would do the same: Concern∣ing this sudden business, the Assembly of the States thought fit to write to the several Provinces, that so the Commons might receive the same with more acceptation, which they did to this effect. That they advise well of the Judgment of the Prince and Senate, in that they had accepted the Con∣dition, which Albertus and Isabella had offered for a Cessa∣tion of Arms, that they might have leisure to transact with the Kings of France and Brittain, and other Princes; and af∣terwards, to consider among themselves, what was fit to be done, as to the rest. What then remained, but that they should all give thanks to God, that he had hitherto so pros∣pered their War, and now had inclined their Enemies minds, to the confession of the truth. But upon the ap∣pointed day of Humiliation, when now the rumour growing common, made mens affections increase, the Ministers that preached, as every ones fancy sed him, turned the whole Series of their Sermons, either to the applause of peace, or despiteful rayling against the adverse parties. However, the States, about the four and twenty of April, sent Instruments of those things lately agreed upon to Antwerp, by Did
Verdusio. And Naya produced the Writing, as it had been ised at the Hague, onely with the addition of the Arch Dukes hands, commanding the same to be firm and authen∣tick: But Verdusio requiring a more solemn Instrument, that hould be equal to that he brought, Naya presently obeyed, and brought such a one from Bruxells: together, with a gold Chain to Verdusio, intreating him at the same time, that be∣cause some things contained in that Agreement, seemed to be of a dubious interpretation, that he would suffer him a return with himself to the States, to advise upon the e. The Arch Duke Albertus, was really so inclinable to peace, that he would not suffer any Hostility to be begun on  part, insomuch, that He commanded all his Governours, (which was clearly beyond the Agreements) that the Soul∣diers sould be kept within their Garrisons; and that all men and Fishermen that were prisoners at Dunkirk, should e set at liberty. And Verdusio having written to the States concerning Raya's Request, and receiving no positive an∣swer, taking for granted what was not forbidden, returned to the Hague with him in his company. And now, they that  not withstood the first motions of peace, begun to repent themselves of their silence, fearing that would really become , which they had hitherto supposed to be but fained. Therefore some of them question, by whose order the Monke  his foot on their ground, being enemies to him and his . Others accused Verdusio, that he had undertaken an hit of so high concernment, by private advice: whereby  plainly appeared, that Naya was not likely to obtain so ily, what in his own daring Imaginations he had already ceived granted. While these things were doing in these parts: in the  while, the Hollanders obtained a famous Victory at , which made the Enemies more desirous of peace, and  more fervent to War. When the last year, the War of
Spain went more slowly on, not without some blemish of their antient Navall Honour, it was thought fit another Fleet should be sent thither, as well for recovering their fame, as at the earnest Request of the Indian Company, who were afraid lest the whole Strength of Spain, should at once fall upon their Ships. Jacob Hemskerke, a man well skilled in Sea Affairs, was chosen Admirall, who had formerly accompanied William Barent in the like Voyage, when most froward Fortune hin∣dered them from making a more narrow Inquisition into the Secrets of the North; besides, he had been twice at the In∣dies, from whence of late he brought a most rich Ship which he had taken in War: At this time, six and twenty Ships were committed to his charge, fitted for War, and four others for carrying Provisions, with Command to do what should seem most beneficial. Nor did he scruple to pro∣mise, that he would so behave himself, as to merit the thanks of his Country, either by death or life, and how full fraught he went out with confidence, may from hence easily be un∣derstood, that he would have no other pay, than the eighth part of that booty, which should exceed the sum of five hun∣dred thousand florens. He was not so covetous of money, of which he had enough, as of glory; but not discovering that his inclination by any ostentation, because composing both his habit and countenance into a reserved civility, he did under that mask, the greatness of a Military mind. At the beginning of the Spring, a little before the first Covenants were made between the Arch Dukes and the States, going to Sea, when he came to the Coasts of Spain, he resolved to invade the mouth of the River Tagus, that the most Noble City of Lisbone might be a witness of his Valour: but un∣derstanding by the Spies, which he had sent under the pre∣tence of Merchants, and by some French and British Ships that he met, that the Ships which had been there, were most of them departed to the Indies, and those that were to follow
them, were not ready, but that a great Fleet of Spaniards lay in the Bay of Gibraltar which would take the Hollanders Ships passing out of the Mediterranean Sea, into the Ocean, in that streight: thither he steered his course, sailing as the Wind would give him leave, sometimes near the Coast of Barbary, and other whiles nearer the Coast of Spain: for two very high Mountains generally known by the names of Her∣cules Pillars, being the Mountains Abila in Barbary, and Calpe in Spain, do make narrow the Streight of the Atlantike Ocean, winding it self between those Lands. Fabulous An∣tiquity, reported these to be one Hill (and indeed so it is, if you admit the strait to continue their union) but divided by the labour of Hercules, on purpose to let in the Sea; where∣upon, the last of those separated Hills, are called as aforesaid, Hercules Pillars. To the one of which, the old name Calpe remained, until the Arabian growing Victorious, gave his own names to all things and places; for at what time the lacens had joyned their Arms to the novelty of Mahome∣ Superstition: Moses, the chief of the petty Kings pos∣sessing Africa, who was the Son of Nuzir of the Maravadine Family, went over into Spain, accompanied with Tarica, the  of Abdalla, who setting fire on his Ships, that his Soul∣diers might not be able to desert him, when he was come within Calpe, he named the place Gebell Taric, which in the Arabian Tongue, is as much as the Mount of Tarica, and ce by the Spaniards, is corrupted into Gibraltar. Thus did  Mountain and City Tarifa, of old Carteja, get their names. This City is scituate at the bottom of those Hills, where making a Haven in the manner of a Theater, for his Ships, on the horn thereof, which stretches into the Atlan∣tike Ocean, he built a strong Castle: In this most safe recess of the Sea, within the bosome of that most exquisite Rock, d under the protection of the City and Castle, the Spanish fleet lay at Anchor. It consisted of 9. Galeoones, the greatest of which, carryed the Commander in Chief, Don John Al∣rez de Avila, four other Ships of War.
The great Vessel belonging to Lubeck, and four French Bottoms belonging to private Merchants, but for a time, ta∣ken up for publike use, besides three Holland Merchants Ships, that had lately been taken as Prizes: In these, was a great number of Marriners and great Guns, together with Souldiers for Sea-service, whose strength was much increas∣ed by the accession of many noble persons, who, upon news that the Enemies Ships were seen both at Cadiz, and St. Lucas de Barramede, had flocked thither, to shew their Valour and duty to the King. In the Admirall, were seven hundred Souldiers, another a little less had five hundred, Admiral Hemskerke, now entring the Streight, and not far from the Bay of Gibraltar, calling together the Captains of his Ships to Counsel: He said to them, Ye know Fellow Souldiers, for what cause ye are come hither: The Honour gotten by our Ancestors, both at Sea and at home, is evident to the whole World; They wasted Islands, and besieged Ports, others by chance assist∣ing them therein; We were the first who came even into Spain it self, to assault the King of Spains Fleet, as intending to let the World know, how falsly the Enemy in the length of his arrogant Titles, ascribes to himself the Dominion of the Sea; A more no∣ted place for Honour, could not be wished for. God hath ap∣pointed the Hollanders Forces to be tryed and approved in the Confines of Europe and Africa; so that here we shall see the E∣nemies themselves, certain Witnesses of our Valour. and their own destruction. On the one Shore, he the Turks and Moors, to whom, being hitherto scarcely heard of, we ought not to be made publickly known, but by some great and honourable action: Take now that Courage, which of old Berghen, Middleburgh, & the Zuyderzee beheld: The same fortune follows you through the World: So that it is a difficult matter for you not to Conquer at Sea; And let not the greatness of the Enemies Ships affright you, for that very Bulk being unweldy to be moved and turned, and lying open to shot, will be rather a cause of ruine, then safety to them. And moreover, this is one chief thing that among us our very Seamen fight, with them only the Souldiers, who appearing to me, as persons of effemi∣nacy,
by the stinks of the Pump, and the tossing of the Waves being grown heartless are hardly able to stand up to fight. I require nothing of any man but what I shall give an example of my self: you, Lambert, shall together with my self, set upon the Admirall, Brassen and Alterhasen on the next, and so the rest on the remainder, two of you still keeping together against one: the lighter Vessels shall go up and down compassing the place of fight, the better to impede the Enemies flight. And as soon as the Battell is begun, Remember that ye fight valiantly for your Ships, wherein you are all either to be slain or taken, unless you get the Victory. Let us forward the anxious and doubtful cares of the States in this great Affair, for this day will yield a great and happy Omen to us, if forced to return to the War, or else will make the Spaniard more seriously to desire Peace: Then may the Conquering Hollander with freedom, deliberate whether it will be more for his advantage, to lay aside Arms, or still to maintain War: We however in the interim, shall begin to be esteemed happy in the Honour of this Maritime tryumph, or else shall be looked upon among the chief causes that lead to peace; and for the be∣nefit of Posterity, shall set a noble end to a War of 40 years continu∣ance. Having spoken these things, he encouraged the Captains as well by his eyes, and countenance, as his words, who pro∣mising largely their best endeavours, likewise stirred up both themselves and others, by old and new examples of Spanish cruelty: so passing about an encouraging Cup, and renewing their Oath of fidelity, for that time they de∣parted. Avilas the Governour, finding Ships so much less than his, steering their course directly against him, commanded a Holland Prisoner that he had with him, to be brought to him; of whom he asked, What he thought was their Intentions? Who answer'd, Either I know not my Countrey men, or else they are ready to give you Battel. The Spaniards laughed, as thinking it a scorn, that their whole Fleet should be compared with that onely Galeoon that was his Admiral: But when the Holland Fleet drew nearer, being compell'd to believe, what he saw
was true, he carryed his said Admiral Galeoon, which by chance lay outermost, nearer to the City, cutting its Cables, that the Fortune of the Battel might first be tryed by the other Vessels: Notwithstanding which, Hemskerk keeping still to his first purpose, passing by the rest, set upon that alone; and at the first Onset, cryed out, That all should be lawful Frize therein to whoever took it, and appointing a Reward besides to him that should bring away the Enemies Top-Mast Banner: Commanding, That they should not shoot, until they were very wear, whereby the greater Terrour might strike them on a sud∣dain. Therefore the Spaniard prevented him, in giving the first Volley of Shot, but he did no great damage by it. Hems∣kerk, by this time, but a little way distant, began to shoot from his Fore-Deck, and presently striking upon the Enemies Ship he cast Anchor. He stood openly in sight, in the midst of the Ship, when the Spaniard making thick and frequent shots, a Bullet (by chance) killing one, broke and tore off his left Thigh, and threw him groveling, being laden with Arms. He was sensible of the approach of Death; and therefore, praying God, mercifully to receive his departing Soul, he exhorted all about him, That they would not be careless in fol∣lowing their business, but would seek to repair the loss of their Cap∣tain with the Enemies Ruine. The death of the Admiral, being concealed by Captain Nerhoeven, did spread over the Fleet until the Battel was ended. The same endeavour'd, that the Cannon on the Right-side might be discharged: The Spa∣niard now having lost the use of his great Guns, applyed him∣self wholly to fight with small Shot; but the Hollanders Shot did the greatest damage, in regard the Enemy stood thicker, and more crowded together. Lambert following, as he was commanded, at first shot at Avila's Ship at a distance, but afterwards came nearer, and lay side by side: so that now a most furious Fight was be∣gun, and all were involved in Clouds of Smoke; insomuch, that at Noon-day they had the Resemblance of a Nocturnal
Conflict: The rest of the Battel wa ordered by Fortune, not according to Command: For while Captain Alterasen of Zeland, delay'd to assault the Ship assigned to him, 3 others invaded him, to whom a fourth soon after joyned themselves: Which having taken fire, by the perpetual vomiting of the Cannon, and that now danger drew near to the Assailants, the Hollanders withdrew themselves, and quenched their Sails, which had likewise caught fire: But the Spaniards, astonish∣ed with fear, casting aside all care of the Ship, after all things in the Ship, and the Ship it self, were seized by the Flame, forced also by the Enemies Shot, leaped head long into the Sea, and so exchanged one kind of death for another: Cap∣tain Henry Long a Hollander, with more Policy, assailing another Galeoon, was kill'd with a Bullet, but that also was fir'd, and utterly burned. Again, another of the same Magni∣tude, being shot between Wind and Water, by the coming in of the Waves, and its own Burden, suddainly sunk. The rest of the Spanish Ships, as also some of the Hollanders, not during to run the hazard of a close Fight, contested at a di∣stance, almost with equal damage to the Enemy and them∣selves. There were many shot also thunder'd upon them from the Town and Castle of Tariff; but suddain violence disheart∣ned the Spaniards, one of their best Ships being blown up and torn in pieces by its own Powder, or else set on fire by themselves: After the horrible Crack had thunder'd all over the Bay, the torn Ships Reliques, setting fire on those Ships next to him, and they likewise drawing others into the like Danger and Ruine: They that remained, before the Mischief should reach to them, cutting their Cables, made hast to the Shore; onely the Admiral prolonged the Issue of the Fight stoutly, making good her part against two Ships, until at last a Third came: But then the Banner or Ensign being pulled down, together with it they lost all their Courages; and the Victors wholly entring, it was no longer a Fight, but a meer
Slaughter. All the Spaniards, as they leaped into the Sea-hoping to escape by swimming, were kill'd either by Swords, Pikes, or Bullets: Not could one fix his Eye on any part of the Bay, where the sad Spectacle of dead or dying People was not with Horrour represented. Avilas not long survive Hemskerk; He was an An∣tient Sea-Commander, for he had accompanied Don John of Austria at the Battel of Lepanto: Among his Papers were found King Philip's severe Instructions, not against the Hol∣landers onely, but all others, who had in any manner assisted them. The French, (whose Ships, before surprized by the Spaniard, but now deserted in his flight) afforded a safe Re∣treat to the Conquerours; They that were taken Prisoners, and kept alive, after, by a rare chance of good Fortune, the Souldier sent by a Spanish Captain to kill them, was by a Bullet intercepted; and a second (sent to put the same Com∣mand in Execution) perish'd by the like means, at last had their Bonds and Chains struck off by an accidental shot. Af∣ter this Battel, the Night continued quiet; and the next Morning it appear'd, that the Spanish Admiral, (which the Hollanders had neglected to keep, as supposing themselves to have undertaken enough) yet floted intire, with some few Men in it; who, while the Victors Fury raged, had hidden themselves in Holes; from whence creeping our, and get∣ting into the Town, the People voluntarily set fire thereon, that it might not become a Prey to the Enemy: Two days the Holland Fleet continued in the place of the Battel, esteem∣ing the Victory rather honourable, than advantagious or gain∣ful. During all the time of their stay there, Armed Men ran up and down; and, on the other side, the Townsmen gather∣ing together all their best and most precious Things, prepar'd to fly: For all Things were now fill'd with fear, the News of this Action being brought by like Messengers to Cadiz, which would certainly have been a great cause of making
Hamskerk much more confident, if he had lived; but now all his Counsels fell to the ground with him. Tittuan, a City of Barbary, not very antient, scituate at the Foot of the Mount Atlas, near these Streights, is subject to the Turk: Hither the Hollanders repaired to amend their ships, and get help and remedy for their sick and wounded Men, of whom they had Threescore, besides almost one hun∣dred slain in the Fight. The Governour of the City, both ha∣ting, and hated of the Spaniards, received the Conquerours with much Congratulations, and sending to them also many Presents; And moreover, offer'd them a Supply of Foot Souldiers, if they would please to assault Septa, a Town up∣on the same Coast, but scituate a little more inward, and pos∣sessed by the Spaniard. But they being more desirous of Booty than War, so determined among themselves, that the greatest part chose to Forage the Coasts of Portugal: Others went to the Azores; some to the Fortunate Islands; and the rest coa∣sted the Promontery of Antabria: Two Ships, of those that had brought Provisions, were sent into Holland, to carry home the wounded Men, and the Body of Hemskerk, which Admiral for the better preserving thereof, was embalmed. The Re∣port of this Battel at Gibralter, which was fought the 25 day of April, was not yet arrived to the knowledge of the Hol∣landers, but then supposed to have been brought by speedy Messengers out of Spain into Brabant, when Naya, then Resident at the Hague, desired the Assembly of the States, the 27 of April, setting forth to them, That he lately, at their Request, promised the Arch-Dukes should take care, that the King of Spain should confirm the Articles, when he had no such thing, either in his Charge or Instructions; And that the Arch-Dukes, when they might have refused that Authority, yet, out of love to Peace, by promising the same, had made good his assurance to them: Now therefore it was but just, that as those Princes had by an extraordinary belief omitted nothing, that might be con∣ducible to Peace; so the States, on the other side should remove all
things that might be Obstructions to the same intent; and conse∣quently should recall their Fleet out of Spain, which had lately been sent thither, to spoil all the Maritime Parts of that Coun∣try. Moreover he desired, That those things which had lately been agreed of late, concerning the forbearance of encamping, and invading each others Country, might be declared in more express and plain tearms, for that the words, wherein they were expressed, were more ambiguous: And since many Things might happen before the first of September, which ought to be published by the States in the Arch-Duke's Names, He required Instru∣ments of publike Credit, and safe Conduct; by vertue where∣of, he might (without hazard) go up and down between both Parties. And now the greatness of the business in hand had wrought upon all Mens Minds, insomuch, that some of the principal Persons of each Province, came and were present at the daily Debates of the Council: At the first, there was much hesita∣tion, concerning the recalling of the Fleet, some Rumours of the Victory at Gibraltar being scatter'd abroad. Whereupon some averred, That it was convenient to prosecute their good for∣tune, and that Peace should not be discoursed of, but in the heat of War. Others were of Opinion, That they ought to shew as well in words as reality, that their Minds were not averse from a true Peace; which if it were not at that time brought to pass, not onely the Sea should be secured, but they would all unanimously re∣sume their Arms, not so much for Revenge of old Injuries, as of their delusive Peace. And it had almost hapned, that they who desired Peace, by making the Spaniard more secure; and they that were against it, putting the Enemy in fear, and seeking after the Causes, why Peace should be sought, that they had brought to nothing their own Counsels. Among these Transactions, Embassadours came out of France, the chief of whom was Mounsieur Peter Janine, of old a great Supporter of the Guisian League; but returning to his Obedience towards the King, together with the Duke de
Mayn; and from thence forward, was a Minister of great Fidelity, and of great Estimation and Authority among the chief Counsellors, for his great and eminent Experiments in points of Prudence, having a Wit rarely skilful in handling Affairs of State; and not onely knowing in the Theory and Practice of the Law, but throughly instructed in all other good Arts: Besides, he was so prevailing, both in Countenance and Words, that when he endeavour'd most to hide himself, his Judgment would most evidently appear. With him were joyned Mounsieur Buzenvale, formerly the King's Agent with the States, and Munsieur Elias Playce, who was Com∣manded to succeed Buzenvale in that Dignity: It seems the King took it ill, that they had begun to lay the Foundation of so great a Matter, onely by the Knowledg and Advice of a few, which he judged they ought not to have begun without his Approbation, as well in regard of his Grandeur, as the Benefits he had often done to the Hollanders. Therefore the Embassadors, according to the Directions given them, pre∣mising many Things, by which they declared, how highly the King had deserved of that Commonwealth, They presently fell to Complaints, first bitterly inveighing against them, who seeming to love the Thing, yet spoke sharply of him, as being ambitious to get the Dominion over them. After∣wards, when they had involved Themselves in Treaties with the Enemy, they made a Clandestine Application to the King, which also he could not but take in very evil part: yet nevertheless, he would not forbear at this time with Courtesie to set forth his Friendship, by this his Embassie; declaring, That he would, for the future, assist them, if they were necessitated to make War: Or, if they thought fit to make Peace, He would, by his Authority, make the same to them just at the present, and permanent for the future; That some might be cho∣sen out of the Assembly of the States, that should before the Em∣bassadors, weigh the Ability of the Treasury, and the ways and means conducing to Peace.
And lest the French Kings Authority might offend other of the Hollanders Allyes, it was judged necessary to request the Kings of Great Brittain and Denmark, as also the Prince Palatine, and Marquess of Brandenburg, to be aiding and assi∣sting by their Counsells in these doubtful and ambiguous Af∣fairs. Upon Naya's demands, after long debate, that part pre∣vailed who were for Peace; Whereupon it was Decreed, That the Fleet should be recalled from Spain assoon as king Philip should have confirmed the Articles granted by the Archdukes; and that in the interim, neither any new ships should be sent thither, nor any provisions; That in the Neighbour Sea, which is enclosed within the Streights and narrow passage by Bulloin, from thence forward should be a cessation of arms, but upon this condition, That none but Fishermen should be permitted to go out of the Ports of Flanders. And as soon as Philips Instruments of Confirma∣tion came, the like cessation of Arms should be in all that Sea that runs by France and Spain, as far as Cadiz, and from thence all over the more inland Sea. They consulted also for the same nearer to them by Land. And thus the United States enclosed their jurisdiction and security, within the fa∣mous boundaries of the Eemes, the Vider, the Issel, the Rhine, the Wael, and below Grave, the Maes, all great Rivers of note; but the Archdukes Countreyes were bounded with less famous Rivers, such as Demmer, and Gatt, in Brabant, Ley, and Amand, in Flanders. All that lay without these Borders was subject to War, excepting only the Cities, Forts, and Castles; yet so as no bounds should defend the Souldi∣ers themselves, offering injuries one to the other, either by Sea or Land. Thus before Naya departed, it appeared, how little in vain be protracted his time among the Hollan∣ders. Notwithstanding all this, it would not be granted that he should stay at the Hague, for that the minds of the States
were possessed with fear and suspitions, not without cause; but he had a residence appointed for him at Delf, where both his going in and out, as all his actions were observed; the reason and Author of which counsel he seemed by bis actions and carriage to approve, for be invited Cornelius Arsen, Se∣cretary to the States, to a private Conference, who presaging to himself the intent of the Design, goes to Prince Maurice, from whom he is commanded, That if any extraordinary gra∣ity were offered, to take the same, and withal, to detect the Enemies Treachery. When they met, the Monk with great Eloquence gave him thanks, That by his assistance, some glimmerings of Peace had been attained; for it is to be understood, that when Naya came first among the Hollan∣ders, by the Mediation of one Craulen (who was nearly re∣lated in bloud to Arsen) he found the first access to him. Af∣terwards he added, That he was not ignorant how great danger Arsenius had hazarded by this Deed, if the matter had not succeeded according to both their wishes, a popular or Aristocratical Government being alwayes full of envy, emulation, and jealousy. That the Archdukes did greatly love, and highly esteem, this his willing inclination to the Peace of the Netherlands: and that as they would for the future give greater rewards, so they would for the present restore to him the house which he formerly possessed in Bruxells, and that the Marquess Spinola, who was of the same mind and desire with them, whether a Peace were conclu∣ded, or only a Truce for nine years, would promise to give him fifty thousand Scutes: of which fifteen thousand, should be forthwith paid to him where he would appoint, and for the same produced a writing cautionary under the said Spi∣nlaes hands. Afterwards Naya in hit own name presented to Arsens Wife a Diamond of great value: Arsen giving thanks for the house, and seeming to believe himself obliged by the Covenant for the same, when it should come to him from the City of Bruxells, for a while refused the rest, as too
hardly pressing upon his fidelity, yet at length he received both the Jewel, and Spinola's writing, and so departing, he declared the whole matter to the Prince, and the Prince again related the same to some few of the States, The Prince supposing the matter fit to be concealed for a time, refused the Custody of the Presents. But soon after Arsen being sollicited by new Letters from Naya to come, and receive his fifty thousand Scutes, and fearing lest this doubtful and dangerous secret might break out to his disadvantage, disco∣vered the whole matter in all its circumstances, to the Coun∣cil of the States. They appointed George Debes a man of ex∣emplary fidelity, and chief overseer of the common Trea∣sury, to keep both the Charter and Diamond: yet could not Arsen by all this care, escape the hatred of the vulgar, who interpreting the common report of the business to the worst sense, grew so enraged, that he was compelled to set forth the truth of the matter in Print to prevent further mischief that might ensue. About this time, Admiral Hemskerks body was brought to Amsterdam, where it was received with high honour and applause, and with no less grief and sorrow, because having been the Author of so great a Victory, his Countrey was be∣lieved to have received the greater prejudice in his loss: to him then first of all was publickly given a Funeral, and a Monument, with an Inscription testifying, with great honor, and eloquence, the famous Actions by him done. After which they sent to the King of Great Brittain, desirous to dive more narrowly into the Affairs of Holland, John Ber∣ken, an assistant to the Magistrates of Dort, and Jacob Male∣ree, a man in principal esteem in the Senate of Zeland; these set before him the present strength and charge of the Com∣monwealth, and how much the Treasury was judged unable both by the Prince and Senate, to maintain the War in any hopeful condition. These were very gently received, by King James, who promised to take a special care of the Af∣fairs
of his Allyes, for he well understood, That by the Hol∣landers Arms, as well his own, as the Peace of Ireland was de∣fended. And no less did he foresee, how unfit he was to perswade to War, who till that time had never given any supply of mony to∣wards it, (which was the greatest want of that War) nor had at the present any to help them with. Not long after, there came from him to the Hague, Richard Spencer, of an honou∣rable Family in England; and Ralf Winwood, then returning out of Brittain, but otherwise Leiger Ambassador for the King with the States. In the intetim, Spinola by Letters sent to the States, signi∣fying the King of Spains confirmation of the Archdukes Co∣venants, and desires a safe conduct for Don Lewis Verreike, Albertus his Secretary, who should bring the Instrument, and declare other things relating to the matter: which being granted, and He come, immediately the Spanish subtilties appeared, for the words of the Covenants were not confir∣med by the Kings Authority according to the Custome of a just League, but the Charters were written in the French Tongue, which is generally spoken by the Duth Nobility, & bore date the eighth of May and brought to them the first of June; which were subscribed by the King in no other manner, then he used to do towards his Subjects, and so con∣firmed, That he promised the Cessation of Arms should be ratified, calling Albertus and Isabella, Princes and Lords of the Netherlands, but in the interim by no word Himself ac∣knowledged the Liberty of the States, according as was desi∣red, nay more, in the very foremost Covenant of Albertus, the words that declared their Liberty, were totally left out, which Verreike called by a ridiculous pretext, the Writers neglect. When he sent word to Bruxells of that objection, the Archdukes said nothing, only John Richardot, the chief of the Cabinet Counsel answered, That the States mistook the words, for so long as King Philip rejected none of the Cove∣nants, they ought to believe that He approved all. And al∣though
though the Archdukes might protest the performance of all things they had promised; yet that their candor and benig∣nity might be the more evident, they sent back again into Spain, for the mending of those things that were found fault with. And the States did not delay to recal their Fleet out of Spain, left while they professed to be desirous of Peace, their Actions should go rancounter to their words. But about this time arose many hot disputes among the United Provinces, many furiously crying out, That they were publickly deluded by the Spaniard, who for the better concealing their Treacheries, had only made an empty offer of Liberty, but now their deceitful dealing bring manifest, he would only endea∣vour this one thing, to denude them cunningly of their Arms. Be∣sides, the Enemy was said to be preparing a Fleet both in Spain and Flanders, the danger whereof was the more suspe∣cted, in regard it was unknown what design they intended. To all these were added the French Ambassadors, then very averse to Peace, because they said it was evident to them, That the nature of the Spaniards was never officious, but when they studied mischief; but they had scarse resolved to consult of that matter, which before they began to agree to, that they would neither send provisions nor supplyes to the Fleet, by which means it might be compelled to return by necessity, which is stronger then any command. Thereup∣on matters were brought to that pass, that Olden-Barnevelde should in the name of the States make answer, That the In∣struments brought out of Spain, were not congruous to what was promised, and therefore the States drew up the same is the Latine and French Tongue, which were to be in like manner perfected within two Months by the King, if he ho∣ped any further to continue the Treaty, which pattern he was to deliver at the same time. And because some delay happened thereby, the States prorogued the space for delibe∣ration after the Instruments were anew confirmed, from that present time, until the first of September; yet it was granted
in honour of the Archdukes (against whose will these neg∣lects seemed to be committed), that the Fleet should be re∣called, and that after six weeks from that day, all things whatsoever that were taken, should be free, and not taken as Prize. But they would keep the Kings Letters till better were brought, chiefly for this purpose, to maintain the cessa∣tion of Arms: Nor in the interim (faith he) can we enough wonder, if this Affair be cordially and with uprightness ma∣naged, to what purpose serve these great Rewards, Behold the Diamond! See the Chain! Look upon Spinola's hand! (and here they were all produced) These cannot be so with∣out suspition in the givers, but that they who received them by publick command, cannot yet be free from the undeser∣ved envy of the people. Be not deceived, for it is not here as in Kingdomes, where two or three rule all things at their beck, and the rest of the people are slaves, but We Govern, and are Governed by turns; And if this Councel, this Se∣nate, be not sufficiently guarded against your bribes, We will encrease their number: Carry back your gifts to their Owners, which you need not give to obtain Peace, and would be a high wickedness in Us to receive in prejudice of our Liberty. Verreike being on a sudden surprised, had no∣thing to say, but that if any such thing were offered, it was without the Archdukes knowledg; nor was it a wonder, if Monks that are a covetous sort of men, look upon others to be such as themselves. Now was the appointed time of six Weeks past, when the Fleet was recalled out of Spain, and also Naya and Ver∣reike having their desired safe conduct, are come, and bring with them out of Spain, another Writing, which contained almost the same words prescribed by the States, with this only difference, That the King professed himself ready to Treat with them as a Free People in any place, and that he would chal∣lenge nothing against them, adding, That he asserted this, as well for maintaining the Credit and Promise of the Archdukes, as for
confirming a Peace or long Truce, which when it was agreed up∣on, He would fully perform all other things that might be desired for the sanction thereof; but that it should be Treated of and con∣cluded in that League, as concerning other desires of Parties, so also of the business of Religion Wherein if there were no Settle∣ment and Conclusion; then his Right should not be prejudiced in any thing by this Writing, but all things to remain intire as before to both parties. They that were more curious, observed, That a business of so high concernment, was carelesly written in Paper, and not engrossed in Parchment for the perpetuating thereof, and that the Name of Philip was not subscribed as to Equals, but like a King, according to his Custome in wri∣ting to His Subjects. The Odium of all these things, Naya foreseeing the same, attempted to mollify with good words, declaring, That he himself, as best knowing the desires of the Archdukes, and the States in relation to Peace, went into Spain, and informed the King in what condition the state of Affairs on both sides was, and how necessary Peace was to the Netherlands. There the matter was debated in Coun∣cil, That whatever was to be Treated of and concluded, might be more firm and lasting, and that not only the King, who is mortal, but the Kingdome it self, which cannot dye, should be bound by those Agreements. He protested also with much earnestness and high asseverations, That the King was very desirous of Peace, and that he intended to walk in the right and plain way to attain the same, and therefore had so clearly declared his mind in writing, which he might have concealed, if he had had any intention to de∣ceive. After him, Verreike highly applauding the Archdukes faithful dealing, he made an excuse, That King Philips ex∣pressions were not Written in Latine or French, but in the Spanish Tongue. In this Tongue he converseth with Chri∣stian Princes, in this he Treats with Free People, nor was it equal for them to take from him this Liberty, who had
hearkned to the States speaking in what Tongue they plea∣d. At this time dissimilitude of thoughts began to discover great variety of affections in the United Provinces, the Prince suspecting Treaties, and some Cities both in Holland and Zeland, hoping a greater advantage from the War, then they could expect from Peace; and therefore he most mo∣derate and collected minds and those that were unanimous in their desires, looked upon these things with more then or∣dinary displeasure, for the acknowledgment of their Liber∣ty, with the only esteem whereof being filled, they began to arken to those dangerous discourses of Peace, might easily, be recalled, and indeed it seemed very little, if any thing at all, unless the Faction of the Romanists should be divided from the Commonwealth by the hope of some favour from the Enemy. But Naya and Verreike, being showed what the States seemed to find fault with in the Spanish Writing, openly professed. That it was but labour in vain to expect any thing more, since if any thing remained dubious, either to the League of Peace it self, or in the Truce, it might be pounded and made manifest in more clear and fitting at arms. So much confidence had they gotten, by observing that a great part of the United Provinces were weary of the War; and knowing it would be much more beneficial to the Spaniard, to make an Agreement with them severally, then all United and conjunct. But the States taking the Prince's Counsel, together with the advice of the French and British Ambassadors, at length agreed in this Opinion, That they would declare to the Archdukes Ambassadors, That the Letters brought out of Spain, were not answerable to the first Promises, because the last words would seem to bear such an Interpretation, that the former Grants might obliquely be avoided thereby; and they being a Free People, and such over whom, neither King Philip, nor the Archdukes, had any Authority, would of their own accord consult of their
Domestique Peace, and not suffer their Affairs to be ordered at the pleasure of others. That there was now a fit occasion given them, not to enter into any further Treaty; yet they would offer so much towards the desired concord, that they would by Letters signify the whole matter to the particular Councels of every Province, and desire their Judgments thereupon, only with this Protestation, That they would ad∣mit of nothing that might be prejudicial to their Liberty; And that the Archdukes should within six weeks time, know what was their result, That if they thought fit to hearken to such Proposals of Peace as they should offer, then within ten dayes after, such Ambassadors as they heretofore promised to send, should come to the Hague, where also their Depu∣ties should be present, but upon this confidence nevertheless, That neither the King, nor the Archdukes, should offer any Proposition, that might intrench upon the States ordering their own Affairs within themselves. And the States ap∣pointed the Hague for the place of meeting, left it should appear unseemly for the Ambassadors of other Kings to re∣move from place to place, and also because the power of ma∣naging the Affairs being divided amongst many, with more ease and wisdome all things might be consulted of. When Naya and Verreike doubted whether upon this an∣swer they should leave the Kings Letters with the States, or carry them away with them; the States declaring they cared not whether of them they did; Naya went to Bruxells to be advised, from whence he brought this answer, That the wri∣ting should remain with them, so as they would give an acknow∣ledgment that they had received the same, for thereby the Arch-Dukes would be free from their promise to the King; and finally, that they should restore the same, if the League came to no effect. Which things being absolutely refused by the States, and the Archdukes once more advised with, Naya without any contract, soon after delivered the Letters. These deliberations being related to all the several Pro∣vincial
Assemblies, many doubted, that it was not safe to ad∣mit a treacherous Enemy into the very bosom of their Do∣minions; what would he do there, but search into the af∣fections and strength of the People, and learn what was at∣imble, either by money or Arms, by force or purchase? They feared also, lest they among themselves who desired peace, running as it were headlong, and without Counsel,  acquire the same, should, by little and little, be drawn to accept of unjust and dishonourable Conditions: There∣fore when the Deputies returned into the Common Council, past of all, they oblige themselves each to other, by mutual consent, that they would, if the Treaty came on, in the very last Article, have their liberty established by fit words, pub∣lickly attesting the same, in such manner as should be suffi∣cient to satisfie the Embassadors of other Kings admitted into the Council: And that they would not admit of any Conditions relating either to profane or sacred matters, that ight undermine their liberty. On the other side, if the Enemy should still persist, they would declare to all mankind, that it was his fault, why Peace was not setled, and that recollecting their Forces, and invoking the ayd of their neighbour friends and Princes, They would resume their Arms, from which they doubted not, but Justice would give a successful Issue to their cause. Prince Maurice and the Zelanders, further insisted, that the very words for Confirmation of their liberty, should then be contrived, and forthwith sent to Albertus, whereto if he would not consent, then to let him know, that they would proceed no further in the Treaty: This sentence seemed very hard to some, who desired the Enemy might be hear∣kened to. At this time, a new year approached, at the beginning whereof, the time for the Cessation of Arms was to expire, nor did the Arch Dukes desire its prolongation, expecting
to have had an Address made to them to that purpose: where∣upon, the States write that they trusted to the Arch Dukes Promises, with the same Resolution they had engaged to Naya and Verreike, expecting a Treaty. And to that purpose they were ready to send seven or eight from them, if they would please to send the like number, or fewer of theirs, whom they would endeavour equally to fit, as formerly had been discovered, with Command and Instructions from them, as they hoped the Arch Dukes and King Philip would do the like, to wit, that the said Commissioner should with all possible speed expedite the business; and that they would consider, whether it were convenient to the matter in hand, whether they would lengthen the Cessation of Arms for a Month, or six weeks; That they would be pleased, it should be for the longer time, if so, the Arch Dukes thought fit to consent; That the States would have the Legates to be such as the Arch Dukes were for the future hoped to be. The meaning whereof was, that only Netherlanders should be sent. For the Arch Dukes first Letters, whereby the States were moved to a Treaty, clearly contained the same: Nor was it a matter of small advantage to the Hollanders, that the conclusions of peace should be weighed together by the principal men of their so wearily allyed Neighbours, among whom as there was less fraud and craft, and one common de∣sign of interest equal with them, though not for liberty, yet against forein oppression and tyranny; which being fore∣seen by the Arch Dukes, they on the other hand were as vio∣lent to the contrary, and from the very beginning, the Ne∣therlandish Nobles had privily fostered the same design, until it should as of necessity seem to be thrown not only upon them, but the Commons also; And lately, Naya and Ver∣reike, when they were at the Hague, were delayed, some speeches being cast abroad, whether the States would endure any forein Commissioners, when the Spaniards Affairs were no less in Agitation, than those of the Arch Duke: But
then their design failed of its effect; yet at this time, the Governours of Holland, who were desirous of peace, when either by conjecture, or some private intimation, that it was likely that Spinola himself the General of the War, together with a Spanish Senator, should be sent, of whom Spinola was by some private means known to be inclinable to peace; and esteeming it of little advantage, by much discourse to the Counsel to breed further jealousies in suspicious minds, they earnestly endeavoured, that the States Letters should be writ∣ten to Naya and Verreike, wherein they should be desired, That they would certainly inform them of the number and names of the Commissioners, that so a fitting care might be taken for their Provisions and Entertainment: In these Letters was a Schedule inclosed, carelesly, as if is had been a matter of no moment, signifying, That they had desired one or another might be admit∣ted into the Legation, besides Natives: being well pleased in that point, to submit to the Arch Dukes, however, the States did not it to intercede, that no Spaniards, especially any of the princi∣pall Officers of the War might come to the Treaty. These words were ambiguously interpreted, for that as the Hollanders seemed only to admit of one stranger, so the Arch Dukes supposed and so believed, that two were not prohi∣bited, and consequently, that the General of the War who was no Spaniard, would not be refused; The name also of Natives, might be extended to the Burgundians, who were adjoyning to the Netherlands, and under the same Govern∣ment, left Richardotte should be excluded, who for his many Counsels, and long continuance in the Court, was esteemed a principal Person, fit for the managing this so great Affair, and therefore thought not to be absent. At this time there returned out of Denmark, Jacob Bowles of Amsterdam, Nicholas Jacob, Symon Horn, and James Groote of Middleburg, who had been sent thither, to salute the King, and to request his Advice and Counsel. And not long after, there came from Denmark as Embassadors, James Ute∣feild,
a Senator sprung from a Noble Stock, and a Man of great prudence, and Jonas Charis; from the Marquess of Bran∣denburg, came Hierome Discue; and soon after from the Count Palatine, Hippolitus Mountayne, famous for several Books by him set forth, and honoured for many well per∣form'd Embassies: But the Emperour Rodolphus, sent Let∣ters superscribed to the States of Holland, and Zeland, and other the Ʋnited Provinces, wherein he called to mind, the pains taken by himself and his Father, in hearing their com∣plaints, and indeavouring to procure their peace: But now it was arrived to his ears, that they were about to make peace with King Philip and Albertus, but that they would first have their Common-wealth declared free; That he much admired he was not consulted with, in an Affair of such consequence, in regard all the Netherlands were a Fee, and part of the Ger∣mane Empire: They should therefore look to it, that they should not without his License, begin any thing, that might be prohibited by the Laws of a feodary. Whereto it seemed good to the States, to return this Answer, That they could not conceive, that Albertus would have concealed his Counsels from his Brother, or Philip from his Kinsman; nevertheless, they were not intended to do any thing, of whose beginning they would not have given Caesar an account: yet they had not for∣gotten those many Complaints, which being oppressed with a most rigid and unjust Dominion, they had put up to the Emperour, and the Germane Dyets: as well before the Arch Duke Matthias, had undertaken their Cause and Government, as after the same was departed from the Netherlands; as also how little or no Re∣lief they obtained thereby: 'Tis true, anon after, there were some Discourses of Peace in the City of Colen, before the Legates of the Empire; but when the Enemy from that very occasion, took cause of making a more sharp War, They were compelled to apply the last Remedy to that Disease, which otherwise would become incurable, to wit, That by publick Decree, they would take from Philip, that Principality,
which he having received well guarded with Laws, which he swore to defend, had so many wayes violated and infringed: Ha∣ving by this means obtained their liberty, and defended the same by Arms, foreign Kings in no manner disputed their Right: That the shedding of blood, and evills of War, wherewith they were fre∣quently afflicted, might be attributed to the Emperour, and those who being torn from them by a League, were ruled by Albertus, The States having always concluded, that they could hope for no good Issue, unless the Common-wealth still retained its present Estate: And now at last, both the Arch Duke Albertus, and King Philip, were drawn to give their consent to that point, that they would have their liberty unquestioned: as might be seen by both their Letters, Copies whereof were transmitted: And now they rested confident, that not only Caesar, but all Germany out of their antient good will towards them, would freely give their assistance  these so pious endeavours of ending a War. Concerning their being Feodary to the Emperour, it was passed over in silence, for that to refell it, would have bred contention, and to confess it, had been dishonourable. King Philip and Albertus, to whom the Emperour had written in like manner, concerning his Rights, re∣turned a like Answer, protesting, that they endeavour∣ed nothing in prejudice of anothers Right; but passing over in silence the debate of right. However, indeed the Fa∣mily of Egmond had, for a long time, possessed Gelderland, in despight of the Emperours, yet the antient Princes thereof, had been accounted under the fealty and Patronage of the Empire, being at first named Guardians, afterwards Counts, and last of all Dukes: And the Bishops of Ʋtrecht who also ruled Over-Issell, and to whom Charles the Fifth succeeded in all their temporal Jurisdictions, took an Oath of Fealty to the Emperours, as is evident from Antiquity: But the Frizons, with the Inhabitants beyond the Lecke, at first, by the assistance of Arms, and some small Tributes, were sub∣ject to the French, afterwards to the German Emperours; but
in all things else, they retained their liberty; which they boast to be granted and confirmed to them by Charlemayne, and since, often by others, and at length, by Sigismund, as is evident; and that their Government hath continued mixt, be∣ing partly Aristocratical, partly Democratical, for the space of seven hundred years: sometimes one being chosen, who under the name of Podestate, hath the perpetual Authority of a Prince, or else is limited to a certain time: After this, the Emperour Maximilian, attempted to put upon them, Saxon Governours, but they were never able to attain the intire Pos∣session, although the Common-wealth were torn with faction, until being wearied with the contest, they turned over all their Right to Charles the Fifth, Prince of the Low Coun∣tries. Charles, the bald King of France, is believed to have set a Prince over Holland, to whom Zeland was connexed; and that that Prince was sprung from the Aquitain Race, or else was one of the chief among the Native Nobility. But the Instru∣ments that were the Authors of that Opinion, granted both the Dominion, and all Right thereof to Thierry as Heredi∣tary, without any mention of a connected Fee; and this only in that part, which formerly belonged to the Church of Eg∣mond, according to the Evil Custom of that Age, inriching Princes, out of Things consecrated to Divine Uses: Not long after, the Empire being divided between France and Germany, the Germanes prevailed about the Rhine: But there is extant a Charter of Otho the Third, which grants to the Earl of Holland, to possess as his own Free-hold, what before he enjoy'd but by a kind of Tenant-Right: But in a short time after, Wars arose between the Emperours, and Earls; the one demanding; the other denying Obedience: Yet there were some Princes, who affecting the Favour of Ger∣many, named themselves Vassals of the Empire; yet with such Liberty, as that they were obliged to no other Duty, than that of Reverence, among whom William became Emperour:
Nor did the Bavarians, being born under Emperours, think of any Change: But the Burgundians, and after them the Austrians, refused to make any Oath of Allegiance, deriving their Liberty from great Antiquity; as if the Emperor Fre∣derick had released to Philip Duke of Burgundy, all Right of Empire; Maximilian of Austria, the Son of Frederick, being rather the Father, and Tutor of a Prince, than a Prince; and making opposition against the Cities by Forein Force, reckon'd Holland, and other people of the Burgundian Juris∣diction within the Body of the Empire, but the States very eagerly opposed the same; and this, among all the rest of the Causes, of the begun Commotions, was look'd upon as one. But Charles the Fifth affecting the Empire, endeavouring to expel the French as Foreiners, it was objected by the very Germans themselves, that the Netherlanders belonged no more to the Almain Empire, than the French did, being ob∣liged neither to pay Tributes to it, be subject to its Laws, not on its Decrees and Constitutions; But He, the more ef∣fectually to attain the Honour he so earnestly thirsted after, promised that he would bring it to passe, that by a firm League, the Netherlanders should unite and grow together with the Germans; and soon after, brought it to such per∣fection, that, what could be offered, either for the priviledge of Germany, or the liberty of the Netherlands, being heard and understood, he confessed at length, that only Gelderland and Utrecht, were Feodaries to the Empire; yet nevertheless, for the future, he required that the rest of the Hollanders and Netherlanders, should joyntly make one part of the German Empire: not that they should receive Laws and Constitu∣tions from thence, but that he might confer unto the pub∣lick necessities, as much as the two Princes Electors; and also that they should be under the Protection of Germany, and should have right of suffrage in their Dyets and Assemblies, in all things else, they should keep their liberty intire.
Upon the account of this League, it was, that the Hollan∣ders, at what time they were subject to the Spaniard, implo∣red the help of Germany, against the Spanish injuries: And in the Treaty of Breda, the Prince of Aurange saying, that Holland and Zeland belonged to the German Empire, (which he spoke meerly to win the favour of that Nation,) King Phi∣lips Embassadors, with much earnestness, denyed the same: But being compelled to defend themselves, and obtaining no help from thence, from that time they withdrew them∣selves from bearing any share in those foreign burdens: Nor was it a new thing, that Leagues were in this manner dis∣solved, since almost all Europe, withdrew it self from the Constantinopolitan Emperours, being by them left undefended against the Barbarians: and the Cities of Italy, by the same Right, obtained their liberty against the Emperours: But it is not convenient for us any longer to prosecute these things; for the order of our intended History, now recalls us to proceed in the same, without further digression. Therefore, after the violence of Arms was somewhat mo∣derated by Covenants, yet the Souldiers did not omit for the whole Year to make Invasions where it was lawful, lay∣ing hold on that last opportunity of making War: For Al∣bertus had commanded a few Horsemen to go to Lingen, la∣den with Money for Pay. These being by chance met by a stronger party of Hollanders, in the Country of Bentheym, were surprized and taken: For when they had betaken them∣selves to the Town of Steenfort, some of the Pursuers entred pell-mel with them, wile the Townsmen, shutting up the Ports, kept others out. Both Parties fought valiantly within the Gates: Those, to keep their Money; These, on the other side, greedy to win it. They that were without, threatned to force the Gates, unless they were set open, as well for them, as the Enemies. Then each of them send to their Neighbour Friends in Garrisons, desiring them to send Assistance: Thus from the small beginning of a Skirmish, was likely to
ensue a sharp and great Battel: But the Citizens of the Town, fearing lest they should become a Prey to the Vict∣, perswaded both, That rather than for the onely hope of Gold, thy should run the hazard of an uncertain Event by Fight, the Hollanders should take three thousand Archidutal Angels, and have the Booty. The Governour of Grave was taken by the Spaniard, while he was passing the Maes with too much se∣curity; and Warner Dubois was kill'd, being Judge Advo∣te of the Army, in the Country of Tiel, as he was taking the Air in his Coach, and with obstinacy refused to surrender himself to the increasing Enemy. At this time, both Parties relying upon the Covenants, dismissed part of their Forein Souldiers; the States doing it  of Prudence; the Arch-Dukes out of Necessity. For Se∣ditios were ready to break forth on every side, if they had not redeemed themselves from new Charges by that Tem∣porary Peace: Nor had they so eschewed the Evil, many of the Souldiers scattering up and down the Country, to the grievous prejudice of the Husband-men; and they that were planted at Dest threatned, by entertaining others among them, to increase their number, if their Pay were any longer delayed. Anon after some Money came from Spain, and some was raised by the Netherlanders: whereupon Pay was sent to them at Diest, and at the same, time Pardon and In∣dempnity was proclaimed to them. Thus the strength of the Confederates being broken, the Arch-Dukes spent that time of Rest which they had from the Enemy, for the encouraging and fortifying Discipline by Examples of Severity, the Au∣thor thereof being Didaco Ibarra, one sent from Spain, to overlook the Treasury and Militia; Therefore they declare by an Edict, the flagitious wickedness of that Sedition at Diest, and their offences against the Publike; who, although they were pardoned their Crimes, yet therefore they were not to be retained in Service as Souldiers, without further Licence: And therefore all that were Associates in that
Sedition, they command, within one Night and Day, to de∣part, and never to return into, or set foot upon any the Lands belonging to the Arch-Dukes, and Spaniards; threatning present justice to all that should remain in, or return to the Country; and proposing great Rewards to all that appre∣hended any of them. The wiser and more moderate sort of Men esteem'd it not fit for that time to publish their Belief and Opinion to the suspitious Hollander; and, by so subtle an Interpretation, to elude (though never so deservedly) their Promises to the Souldiers. In this place, it is not fit to defraud Posterity, of that rare Example of the Hollanders Wealth and Ingepuity, which ef∣fected Operations against Nature; for some private Per∣sons undertook, and fortunately brought to pass, the draining of the Lake Bamestren, adjoyning to Parmeren, seven hours Journey in compass, and six Foot deep in Water; This they did with Engines driven by the Wind; and against the out∣ward Force of the Waters, they raised Banks: Indeed, the Isles of the Hollanders, were for the most part of a very low Situation, but were preserved from being overflowed, by ex∣ceeding great Labour and Industry: Nor did the Ocean cease to vindicate it self, by Breaches upon, and Inundations of the Fields and Towns; some whereof were long since by the same utterly overthrown, and the Currents of Rivers be∣ing altered in such manner, that there was hardly any where to be seen the like great Exchanges of Land and Water. Gibrand Warwick returned out of India with two Ships, which he had repaired in the Island of Swans, (which the Hollanders call Maurice's Island) placing Anvils for shaping and forming their Iron-work, in a naked and desart Soil: Captain Peter Verhoeven went thither with 13 others: He had formerly accompanied Hemskerk and had a great share in the Honour and Victory of Calpe, or Gibraltar: Beyond the Emes Prince Enno, after Spinola's taking of Lingen stood
in lost awe of the power of the United States, and accordingly had given their Legue more churlish Answer than ordi∣nary: They of Embdon likewise took that Opportunity, mplaining of many Things concerning him; as, That he had by sinister means prohibited to be sent to the Overseers of the Treasury, any Pay for the City-Garrison, or other Things, for support and managing the Publike Charge; That he alone, with∣out any Decree of the Council, had setled Taxes; That he suffer∣ the Spanish Souldiers unpunished, to go about the Country and  it. But the most heirous Fault objected against him, s, That when Sea-men went into Spain, he had not given them letters all alike, but as he had known them either follow his Par∣ or stand for their Country: Whereupon it follow'd, that whoever were taken, and cruelly used, (and they were not a ) they accused the Prince Enno to have betrayed them by that under-hand dealing. But the United States, when they  Christopher and John Prince Enno's Brothers, were re∣sident in the Country beyond the Eemes, sent Souldiers to rd the Suburbs of Embden; And to Enno himself, not only Ambassadors but a Trumpeter with Letters, whereby he was commanded within 8 days o To revoke all Acts by him done▪ ary to the Covenants, and to do his endeavour, for setting free all that were Prisoners in Spain: Which if he refused to do, They protested, He would compel them to unwilling Arms; which they supposed would be very grievous to him. He sends into Brit∣ain, to purchase the Favour of that King, to whom he hoped, it would easily be proved, that a Prince might pick what Quarrel he pleased with his Subjects. But at last he sent to rge himself with the States by his Embassadors, especially concerning that Mischief done to Sea-men: Which had not hapned by any Treacherous Dealing of his, but after Embden had received a Garrison of the Hollanders, all going from nce into Spain, were taken as Enemies. Thus the States advising them on both Sides to Peace, dismissed them for the present.
After this, Audience was given to the Embassadours of Charles King of Sweden; and it was granted, that he might raise and list Souldiers in any the Cities of Holland: For he prosecuted the War sharply, infesting the Levnians, while Sigismund was vexed with a New Rebellion at Home: Be∣sides these, and some growing Commotions in the rest of Europe was quiet, or at least without War. The French King bad reconciled the Vanetians to the Pope, upon these Tearms; That the New Laws made against Priests, should be of no force; and whoever of them, at any time, should be apprehended, for any Crime, should be deliver'd up to the Pope. Thus the Pope took off the Interdiction of Religion, which he had laid upon them; and they, who by reason of thse Dissentions had left the City, returned thither again: Onely the Venetians absolutely refused to re-admit the Jesuits: Whereupon some Assassinates were hired, (notwithstanding Affairs were thus composed) against Paulo Servita, a Man who had both by his Counsels and Writings done faithful service to the Commonwealth; this Man was almost slain with divers Wounds: And as well they that did the Fact, as they that hired them to do it, fled into the Pope's Dominions. The Senate declared, That the said Paulo was under publike Prote∣ction; and whoever could apprehend and deliver up, or kill any that had been guilty of the same Crime, should have a great Re∣ward of Money: And the more to intice them, they should have the freedom to recall any two other that had been banished for other Crimes. When there was a Difference with Fontayn, Governour of Millayn, concerning the Bounds of the Rhetians, which Controversie he had determined to follow nor before Judges, nor by a publike War, by a suddain surprize, retain∣ing to that purpose, the Forces raised in the time of the Va∣netian Troubles: The Treason being derected, and explained with the punishment of such as were guilty, made the ∣ans more wary. But the French and Venetians composed and
setled the Matter, being ready to be decided by open Arms. In Germany, the Duke of Bavaria, seeking the Rights of his Ancestors, drew also under his Jurisdiction by Arms, the City Danowert, scituate near the River Ister, being proscribed by the Emperour, for a Tumult raised against the Priests, and the Roman Religion: And the Protestants of Germany, too late after the Event, were angry, at what they had neglected to prevent; many of them that were more slow to act, mur∣muring among themselves in Conventicles; and others, ex∣hibiting Complaints to the Emperour. The King of Spain, while he was not troubled with any Enemy at Sea, receiving safely his Indian and American Fleets; and besides, raising a great Sum of Money in Spain, wholly inclined his Thoughts to this, That he might by little and little free himself of his great Debts, as of mingling his pub∣licke Power with his private Credit, he lessned the Usury he was nt to pay to his Creditors, and prolonged his own Day. France also was fill'd with the hopes of a long Peace, by the Birth of another Male-Child; And the Rebellion of the Country People of Brittain, against the Covetousness of the Nobles, was in some short time repressed; and, at the pre∣ent, Peace there was setled, by granting them Pardon, and for the future, guarded by well-setled Laws. From Ireland two Earls, Tyrone and Tyr-Oneal, He, of , famous for his Rebellion, but both Fugitives first into France, then into Brabant, preferred the Love of the Roman Religion before any thing, choosing rather Banishment, than to Revenge it; which King James esteeming injurious to himself, set forth in a Book, That they, according to the recei∣ved Custom of the Age, too much pretended the Cause of Reli∣gion, to hide the scandal of their Crimes: For what care (saith he) could men so really barbarous take of Religion, to whom Mar∣riage was a thing unknown; by whom Murthers were commended and with whom the greatest Thief is most honourable? And how
horrid is it in these, who obtained their Honour, not by the Nobility of their Bloud or Merits, but by his, or Queen Eli∣zabeth's Favour, to shew such an Ingratitude of Mind, such a Conscientiousness of their Treachery, that they would again attempt, what they had bin once pardon'd, solliciting a whole Province to Defection and Rebellion, and contrive a Conspiracy to the slaughter of all the English: Nor were there wanting Priests and Jesuits, the usual Authors and Pro∣moters of such wickedness, to foment their Designs: But the Assistance of Forein Power, being in vain implored by them, their impious Attempts left no safe Refuge but in flight. The Seventeenth BOOK of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. THat the Enemies Embassadors delay'd their coming, this Years most sharp Frost, and worthy to be remembred among the Rarities of the Time, was a main cause, or else it was a part of the Spanish Pride to be long expected: In the interim, the States transacted with their Friends, That they might try what might be hoped from them in Peace or War. Then did the Affection of the French clearly appear emi∣nent towards this Commonwealth, there being hardly any found, that would imitate their Pattern: For they made a League, wherein it was agreed, That the King should give Assistance against the Violaters thereof, that either offer'd publike Injuries to the Hollanders, or being warned had by dissimulation done any private Offences; and, to that end should send to their Aid Ten Thousand Foot: If the King
a Kingdom of France suffer'd any Hostility from an Ene∣my. The States were to help him either with 500 Foot, or so many Ships, as should equiballance that Number. If either d any thing beyond this for the other, it should be owed  till the end of the War, and then to be re-paid; That either should make any Agreement with the Enemy, without as Allies Consent. And in point of Commerce, the Hollan∣ders should be free among the French as Citizens, and the French equal to the Citizens of Holland. But the Brittains, that they might not make the like League, first of all renewed the old Controversie, concerning the Trade of Clothing; which only one Society among the English, would ave, and afterwards they demanded, That before all other things, the old Debt of the States should be more narrowly treated . The Germans a Nation full of delay, from whom, as also from the Landgrave of Hessen, Embassadors came, pretended, That their Princes desired nothing more, than to confirm the League upon mutual Assistance each of other; yet that they had received no certain Power and Authority to settle that Affair. In  interim, these (in effect) were the Things which they ommended to the States, if Peace were concluded: to wit, that Care might be taken for the Indempnity of the House of Nas∣sau; That the Spaniard should make satisfaction for the Dania∣ Mendosa had done in Germany; That no Liberty should be parted to any within the States Jurisdiction, to use the Romane rites in matter of Religion; That in the disbanding of Souldiers, tion should be used, that no damage should accrue thereby to the Neighbours; And that all Taxes upon Provision, should for the future utterly cease. At length, in the beginning of the Month of February, ar∣rived the Embassadors from the Enemy, which were Spi∣la, and Mancicido a Spaniard, the King's Secretary for Military Business: Afterwards, Richardot, Verreik▪ and Naya,
being drawn in Sleds over the Frozen Waters, enter Holland then indeed open, and not shewing any of the natural strength and beauty of its Rivers: Where ever they passed, they were courteously Treated by the Governours of Cities, and were not far from the Hague, when Prince Maurice went out to meet them: On every side was an infinite com∣pany of men, whom the greatness of that unusual Sight had drawn together, and to behold a Thing the Year before be∣lieved by no man, that the two chief Commanders of that great War, who lately had led such Armies, mortally hating one another, now unarm'd mutually embracing each other; and instead of the Violence of Arms, and Stratagems of War, contesting onely who should most exceed in Humani∣ty: Spinola passing in Prince Maurice's Coach, and some Discourse begun, each of them received great Advantage from the others Vertue, one expert Enemy giving a true Judgment of his Opposite: But after the Italian General provided of Lodgings, according to his Dignity, began to set forth his pretious Houshold-stuff, and all other Things pre∣par'd for Ostentation: It is wonderful to tell, what vast con∣course of men daily flocked thither from the utmost parts of Holland, meerly to see the order of his Service, the furnishing of his Table, and chiefly his Person. Indeed, many were drawn thither with the desire onely to satisfie and feed their Eye; but others came thither, who not onely owned but boa∣sted their Affection to the Romane Religion: Nor was He nice, in shewing himself to all Comers; nay more then that, he supposed it a becoming thing, sometimes to speak first to many by an Interpreter; or else thereby he fancied to him∣self a hope of gaining the affection of the Commons against the Nobles. At the Request of the Enemies Embassadors, a more so∣lemn meeting than ordinary, was granted, where before the Prince and the Senate, after Salute and Complements passed, they declare to what purpose they were sent. And now some
were chosen that should treat apart with them: first, in the Name of the whole Council of the United States, were ap∣pointed William of Nassau, and Walrave Brederode, then ery single Province added one, as Gelderland, Cornelius , Holland, John Olden Barneveldt, Zeland, Jacob Maleree▪ Vtrecht, Nicholas Bercke, Friezeland, Gelly Hellaman, Over-ssell, John Sleethen, and Groening, Abl Cunderten. The first dayes were spent, while each inspected and ar∣gued the others Commands and Instructions: King Philip in his Letters, styled the Arch Dukes the chief Princes of the Netherlands, and speaking of the liberty of the United Pro∣vinces, he recited that clause, which formerly he had menti∣oned, that it should be then of full force, when the Peace was concluded, wherein also there were Instructions con∣cerning Religion, and other matters in controversie. The Arch Dukes in their Epistles, set forth the words; whereby Philip of late had ratified whatever Agreements they should make, upon any the States Demands, the States nevertheless, often averting and complaining of the con∣trary: Besides, when Philip gave power to the Arch Dukes, of making Peace, either by themselves, or those whom he had delegated to that business. The Arch Dukes Instructions did not plainly enough speak and declare, the right which they had received from King Philip, to be transferred by them to their Embassadors. To all which Objections, the Spaniards plusibly excusing the rest, promised that they would take care, that nothing should be wanting in the making perfect their Commission: yet on the other side they argued, that the States Instructions to their Commissioners, by a new example, had bound and tyed them up by secret and private orders. To which it was an∣swered, that that should in no manner, hinder the business, in regard the States themselves were present, who, as any one Head or Article of Peace was agreed on, should immedi∣ately confirm the same by their Authority; for it was con∣sented
to by both, that all things should not be proposed at once in general, but each thing particularly, as the same was to be decided or debated. The Hollanders insisted on this, that they might try the Enemies minds, at the beginning, by the most difficult things whether they only desited a Treaty▪ or really intended a Peace: But the Spaniards were for a more dilatory way, and that they might avoid any concessions they should be forced to, as often as they thought fit. The Spaniard offered either a Peace or a Truce a long time keeping secret, what at last almost too late was known that they could not indure a Peace upon equal tearms; but would consent to such a Truce: On the other side, the States from the very beginning, professed, they desired to put an end to the War, and not only to give an intermissive Cessa∣tion thereto; for it was manifest, that the exhausted Forces of the Spaniard, would in time re, and in the ineri, the Neighbour Kingdoms might grow evilly affected to∣wards them: besides, many other things were spoken against a Truce, which we shall hereafter commemorate. Wherefore at this very time, they began to Treat about a Peace: the first branch whereof was about the confession of the liberty of Holland: upon which matter, the Debate be∣ing begun: Don Richardot said, In matters not to  if they please to make themselves a Kingdom:  he desired them, that the Covenants might be so made in such words, at might do least prejudice to the Kings Honour. The Confederate States desired, that the King and Arch Dukes should in their own Name, and the Name of their Heirs and Successors for ever, desist from their Claym of the Seven Provinces, and Lingen and Trent, and whatever else they possessed, so as for the future, they should not use either their Arms or Titles: But the Spaniards grievously complained both to the French and English, of this contumelious demand, as they pleased to call it; protesting, that it was a devestable thing, that harder
aws should be imposed on them by that People, then Kings are wont to prescribe to Kings: The Kingdom of Navarre is possessed by the Spaniard, yet the antient Inhe∣tors thereof, retain the Honour of the Title: The King of Great Britain entitles himself to France, yet neither is the French offended with this, or the Spaniard with that; for the Spaniard himself hath nothing of the Kingdom of Jeru∣salem, but the Name; whereto when the Hollanders replyed, That Kingdoms were supported by their Majesty: But free People could never be wary, or cautelous enough, and that the loss of a few words, would be no great matter, in the great and swelling Titles of the House of Austria; at last, the Spaniards did admit the condition, so as all other things might be likewise concluded. This easiness of the Spaniard, was suspected by wise men; not was it without Reason at that time conjectured, that they had speciously consented to that demand, being so popular, and pleasing to all because there remained other things, which being within the words of their conceded liberty, would destroy both their Power and Wealth: or else things not equally common with them and the Confederates, would involve them in dissentions. In the progress of the Treaty, the Solemnity usually in Leagues, concerning the Oblivion of all acts of Hostility, and the prohibiting making of Seizures▪ took up little or no debate; But when they came to the point of Commerce, the Spaniards declared, that the Hollanders must abstain from going to the Indies, and other long Voyages by Sea, as not used before the War, and that this was the main Reason that moved Philip to hearken to Peace: Nor was their liberty of so small concernment to them, as that they would refuse to give such a price for it, especially no damage accruing thereby, since instead thereof, they should have the benefit
of the Spanish Trade, which is nearer to them, and more safe, which while it formerly continued free to them, they never once thought of the Indies: Adding further, that by the Treaty of Verbin, neither the French nor the English; by the Treaty made at London, were admitted to go into those parts, which the Castilians and Portugueses alone, had for so many years challenged to themselves, as the first finders thereof. But the Embassadors of France and England, refelled this, affirming what was lawful by the priviledge of nature, and not prohibited by any League, they esteemed it unque∣stionably permitted, and by that right they used it. But these things, during the time of the Treaty, were debated in Books and Writings, wherein was set before them the love of their Country, and the private gain from the Indies, to be preferred before the Spanish Dominion that was unjust; how great therefore was the necessity of the Hollander, who ha∣ving nothing but a barren Soyl, and full of Marishes, gain Wealth and Glory from the Sea, wherein with their own strength, they are able to cope with their most powerful E∣nemies? Nor would the adjoyning Seas, that lie near about them, be sufficient to maintain so great a multitude. There being used in the Voyage to Guiny 20 good Ships, to the I∣slands of Salt fourscore, to the rest of the Coast of America, almost twenty, and to India only 40. wherein and whereby were imployed no less then eight thousand Seamen, from all whom, by such a League they would take away their Lively∣hood, or in effect, command, or rather compel them to flight, a thing ignoble in every Citizen, but odious and abominable towards them, who deserved so much, and so well of the Common-wealth; As well private as publick Utility, should be something respected, it being well known, how mightily in a short time, the gain of the Indian Trade was increased, and it might easily be collected by the profit thereof, for these last fifteen years, what might be hoped for from them
in the future: there yet remained Cambaya, Malabar, Crilon, Narsinga, Coroiandell, and certain other places hitherto un∣known, and but slightly enquired after: Now what if that of China and America, opposite to the other Ocean, should he looked after, and the yet undiscovered World, under the South Pole, should wait to be made known by the Hollanders; let the Spanish and the Indian Trade be divided between them, yet the last will not be admitted to be lost hitherto, ince it hath still been used by the French and English, this in effect, is no other, then to seek the recovery which may be continually lost, and in the mean time, certainly to loose what can never be recovered; for a Society once dissolved, cannot by any means be re-united. Besides, the Indian Ships are fit and ready for War, whereof some are always at home it for suddain Service, and without any publick charge, would be a publick Fleet; But what would the Spanish Fleet, nothing but at pleasure, take booty from their Enemies. Let the gain thereof here, be shared with their Enemy; and let him there also partake of their most plentiful advantage, and by that meanes, the Spanish Wealth, now too great to let the World enjoy peace, will be lessened. And that it may be the better discerned what ought to be denyed to King PHILIP, it is to be observed, what he most earnestly demands, which may be imagined the cause of his desiring peace. Those antient LORDS of that poor Kingdom, are beholding to India and America, for the great raising of their Fortune, which at this time hath made them so proud, as to despise Kings; for herein is concerned the cause of most neighbour Princes, to whom by the loss of the Sea, the Hollander would be of no use. If we look upon the Enemy aright, we shall find him bend all his endeavours thither, that he may be able to do inju∣ries, when and where he pleaseth.
The Hollanders labour for this only that they may not be compelled to suffer. If either Justice or power be sought, they have on their side all Laws, both Divine and Humane, who have given to all a right of Navigation and Merchan∣dise as Nature hath disposed to all an equal share both of Ayr and Earth. Although before the Wars the Hollanders did not sail to the Indies, yet that they had a right, and might have done it, nor can the longest possession prevail against the Authority of the Law of Nations. They that would shut up the Sea, and challenge Merchandise to themselves alone, what other thing do they then Pyrates, and Ingroffers of Provision? Antiquity averred Arms to be justly taken up against them who excluded any from their Harbors, how much more then against them who would drive them from the Ports belonging to others? Peace without Trade, is not Peace, but a perpetual hostility where the right of Defence is utterly taken away. And now the hitherto unspotted fi∣delity of the Hollanders could not be sullyed by a more no a∣ble example, then if they should leave and betray the Indian Kings and People confederate with them to the Spanish cru∣elty. If the Spaniards resolve to perform what shall be agreed on let the business now be perfected (as it will be), when the Hollanders are declared Free, and when they have agreed, then that each shall quietly enjoy what at the present he shall possess; for nothing ought to be limited to Free∣men, and Traffick admitted in all places whereof they have Possession. But that they should set so high an esteem upon Philip for yielding up a part of his Dominion, there was lit∣tle reason truly for the same, since it was not a gift, but a con∣fession of the truth, without which there was no hopes of concord. It were more honourable for him to give or take Peace, then while his Affairs succeeded so well, to sell it; which if he would not believe, he should eft-soons experi∣ment it. The fruit of forty years bloudshed would be ut∣terly lost, and in vain were Arms taken up for Liberty, and
against that terrible bugbear of Commerce, the tenth raised by Alva, if now as great a slavery should be voluntarily admitted to, and they suffer themselves to be deprived of the greater part of the World by their Enemies, which they ould never have endured from any Prince. These things were urged by them. A few on the other side averred, That this was private bu∣siness, and ought not to hinder the publick Peace, at least∣ise, that the cause of some Maritime people ought not to be handled alone, when the evil of War extended to all. Lastly, where the Spanish Negotiation was short and safe, it ticed Seamen, by their good will to avoid long Voyages, which are frequently obnoxious to diseases. Upon mature consideration of the matter by the United States, these things seemed to them to be just causes, why they would not desert and quit the Indies; yet that they ight not leave any thing untryed for the ending the War, after much dispute, they offer the Spaniards their choise, ei∣ther that they would make a firm Peace with freedome of Navigation, or else according to the example of France and Brittain, all beyond the line should be left to the decision of Arms, or else to conclude a Peace here, and only a Truce ere. But the Spaniards would neither permit that negoti∣ation, saying, that Peace and War mingled resembled a Prodigy; but at last they gave hopes of a Truce in the In∣dies, if when the time thereof was elapsed, they would ab∣stain from any further Navigations to those parts. But the States, that abhorred those conditions, revived the Counsels of the American society lately laid aside, if perchance they could work upon the Enemy by fear. But they quickly un∣derstood these were but threats; nor indeed did that matter proceed any further, while they who were desirous of Peace among the Hollanders were afraid to be severe towards dis∣senters. Without doubt this state of Affairs was very prejudicial to
the people of the United Provinces, Arms being only for∣bidden, as uncertain whether there should be Peace or War; whereupon many of the common people, who got their li∣ving by War, were not apt to apply themselves to any other business, and so were afflicted with two evils, idleness, and penury, and therefore the States esteemed it more conveni∣ent to hasten the end of the Treaty; to this purpose they advised the Spaniards, That they should on both sides pro∣pose the chief heads of what was to be insisted on. They al∣ledged it to be an unusual thing, to make new Proposals be∣fore the former were concluded; yet at length they con∣sented, not that they would distinctly and plainly offer the particulars, but only the chief points in general, and that in obscure tearms; for they said there remained yet to be trea∣ted of concerning their limits, the restitution of goods, For∣reign commerce, money, and those immunities which were granted to the English or others in the Netherlands, as also of Religion, and Neighbouring Princes. Being asked, when they mentioned Religion, since the same was contained in King Philips Letters, whether this were their meaning, That they which passed up and down should not be infested un∣der pretence of Religion, or whether they would prescribe Laws to the Hollanders, whereby Divine matters among them should be ordered? They answered, This was a mat∣ter concerning which they would advise with their Prince, and after the other things were seled, when they came to that, they would more clearly procure and produce their de∣termination. On the other side, the States delivered not a few, and those ambiguously contrived, but eight and twenty branches or heads, contained in plain words, such as usual for the confirmation of Peace, or taking away the injuries of War; nor did they omit private commodity, either of the House of Nassau, or of Emmanuel, whose Father Don Antonio, for a short time possessed the Kingdome of Portugal. A conference being appointed concerning the chief con∣troverted
points, immediately to the contest of the Indies, was added another about the European Commerce, this also having no small difficulties, for the passage to Antwerp be∣ing opened, the Hollanders, but chiefly the Zelanders feared a damage to their Negotiations, whereupon Don Richardot me to the States Commissioners, beseeching them with , That they would not lose out of their hands a Peace so much hoped for, by too pertinacious a defence of what pleased themselves. Nor did he obscurely maintain, that nothing could be determined concerning Trade, unless the pleasure of the King of Spain were first known therein, and therefore the States should remember to contrive such a manner of Covenant, or Article, as might be approved by a Prince, who is neither Conquered, nor a Captive, but really desirous of Peace. The Moneth of March being almost spent, the time li∣mited for the Cessation of Arms was almost expired; it was agreed therefore, That April, and May should be added. And then the States offered this Condition concerning the Indies, That it should be free for their Citizens during the space of nine years, from the Conclusion of the Peace, to go to all those places, unless where the Spaniard had Dominion. And that they should not at any time come thither, unless they had permission from the Governors, or were compelled by necessity. And during that time, all hostility should cease between them and their companions, and if any should do the contrary, it should not be lawful to take vengeance for the same in any other place, then where the injury was committed, or the doers of the injuries lived, and then be∣fore the expiration of the said nine years, there should be a more firm and lasting Agreement endeavoured. The Spa∣niards refused this, and plainly argued, That the Indian Ne∣gotiation should for the present be limited, and for the fu∣ture left off. But the freedome of home Commerce, which the Hollanders seemed to suspect, they provided for the same
by these Articles: First, That all Taxes invented during the War should be abolished, and only the antient moderate Tributes remain. That the priviledg of drawing Merchan∣dise to particular Markets, usurped by divers Cities, as of German Wines to Dort, French Wines to Middleburgh, should be prevalent against the Citizens of other Nations and Countreyes. On the other side, the Hollanders under∣standing whither this tended, declared it to please them, that no greater charges should be laid upon Forreigners Merchandising, then upon Natives; but the rights of Ci∣ties to continue in the same posture they were before the Belgick troubles. Also they esteemed it just, that some cau∣tion should be given to them, that the Ships that went from thence into Spain, should be free and unmolested. Concel∣ning these Controversies Naya was sent into Spain to speak with the King, with promise to return within forty dayes; but the event evidenced that promise either to be false or rash. However the interval of time was not spent in vain: for first the States took into consideration the money owing by them to the English; and soon after make a League (likely enough to continue if Peace were concluded with Spain) almost upon the same tearms as they had done before with France, only but half the number of supplyes were promised. Then all that were assembled above the number of the Commissio∣ners returning to their own Provinces, they that were cho∣sen to preside this business of Peace, called to the Enemies Ambassadors, That they would expedite their demands upon the rest of the Heads to be Treated on. The debate being entred into concerning Limits, the Spa∣niards were not ashamed to insist, That Brabant, Flanders, and all Gelderland beyond the Waell, should be delivered up by the States, who in stead thereof, should receive Lingen, Oldenzeel, and Groll, (which certainly would have been a very unequal exchange). And when they condescended thus
far, That for a short time the States should have the custody of the Towns, yet so as the Soveraign power and Jurisdicti∣on should be vested in the Archdukes; they further said, That they divided the Netherlands too liberally, leaving that part to their Neighbours, which the Fortune of War had de∣termined to be the strongest. The rumour of this business being dispersed, the Brabanters under the States Jurisdicti∣on, not contented to obtain that they should not be deliver∣ed up to the Enemy, thought they had a fit occasion given them, whereby to recover their right of having a Vote in the publick Council; for after the principal Cities, and the last of them Antwerp, had yielded to the Duke of Parma the rest being less then could govern themselves, received Laws, Tributes, and Magistrates, from the Authority of the seven United Provinces, although Berghen op Zoome had ever con∣tinued faithful to the States, yet Bredah and other places that were taken and retaken by War, recovered their Liberty by the Trajectine League. But those were not times wherein either the labour of Conjunction, or the multitude of Judges ought to be increased. Little was yet done with the Enemy, when even now the Moneth of May was drawing to an end, when they among the Hollanders that were desirous of Peace, faintly desired of the rest, That the residue of the passing year might be added to the Cessation of Arms; but upon this Condition, That the Treaty should no longer be continued than the end of July. Which being agreed, They fell to discussing the matter concerning the restitution of goods, which gave new matter of dissention, the former points not being fully con∣cluded; about which Verreike going to Bruxells, and retur∣ning with speed, reported what was the intention of the Archdukes, That it was fit the burdens propagated by War, should be thrown aside and buried by Peace▪ and for the Towns of Brabant and Flanders, they would gratify them with the same, so as they might enjoy the whole Countrey.
That as all private persons were to have a restitution of their goods, so likewise were to be restored to the Princes the goods their Ancestors enjoyed, there being several sorts of profit of possessions due to the Majesty of Dominion; not did it follow, because the Archdukes had denuded them∣selves of this, that therefore he should be deprived of the rest. The States contradicted, that a Government could not be deprived of its Revenue, nor Cities of the ground belong∣ing to them, without the Ruine and destruction both of Go∣vernment and Cityes, and therefore unless they come to more moderation, they would suddenly break off the Trea∣ty. The others insisted, That although they denyed the Re∣venue, yet certainly there was no reason why they should refuse to restore the private Patrimony of the Princes. But this crafty difference and distinction was denyed also, for that in these places, there was no separate account of the Publick Treasury, and the Princes Patrimony. And al∣though they delayed to discover, what they would have comprehended under the name of Private Goods; yet it ap∣peared, That under that Cloak they would hide as well Towns as whole Countreyes purchased by Princes, or other∣wise gained by any peculiar Title. But when the Hollanders said, That a great part of their future security consisted in this, That the Spanish Garrisons should be drawn from the Borders of the Netherlands, the Spaniards protested, That it was a dishonourable thing to be required by them, since they were able to defend their Territories with French and Brittish Souldiers. No more did they hearken to the demand of restoring to Germany, the places they possessed belonging to the Jurisdiction of Almayne; and therefore Verreike was again sent to Bruxells, and after his return, they entred upon the debate concerning the use of Priviledges, the access of ships of War to the shores, the right of Fortification, the choosing Magistrates for those Cities, which by the Peace
would fall to the share of private persons or Lords, the cau∣tions and assurances of Peace, and the not resuming or fal∣ling again to War for any injuries, without publick Procla∣mation. Nor did they well agree in these things; but the chief thing that offended the Spaniards was, That the Hollan∣ders desired the League might be confirmed, not only by the allowance of the Archdukes, but also by the consent of the Nobles and Cities under their obedience. And when they were again spoken to concerning Religion, they said, They must of necessity wait for Naya's coming out of Spain, whom the procrastinating nature of that dilatory Nation in Affairs of concernment, detained longer then ordinary. Under this pretence, they requested, That the time limited for the Treaty being about the first of August, might be lengthened unto the thir∣teenth of September. In the mean time, Janinus went into France, that he might inform the King, what was the condition of the Com∣monwealth in Holland, what the inclination of their minds, what their ability for War, and what were their hopes of Peace: He at the same time consulting within himself about a Truce, because both by the publick and private col∣loquies of the United States people, he knew many of them werse to War, and was sensible the Spaniard would never endure an indifferent Peace. It was not a matter of small moment, that the States, if the War continued, had desired of the Kings their Associ∣ates, a great supply, protesting, That there remained to them no sort of Tribute untryed, and yet their Treasury was un∣able to maintain those Forces, which Prince Maurice had formerly adjudged necessary for the carrying on of the War. These were indeed the designs of those that were willing to have Peace, which the Prince too late hoped to avoid by contracting the charge of the War into a narrower com∣pass. At this time Don Pedro de Toledo was Ambassador in
France, whom King Philip had sent thither to King Henry, to intreat him, That he would so moderate the Hollanders Propo∣sal, that his Master might lose as little of his Royal dignity as possible. Then also was King Philips daughter offered to be given in Marriage to the French Kings son; but King Henry was not desirous of that affinity, He himself formerly having sought a Marriage with the Family of Medices, rather then with the House of Austria, that abounded in Women, This Embassy was suspected by some of the Hollanders, but chiefly by the English: And the Dowry to be given in Mar∣riage, was reported to be a right of Dominion over the Hol∣landers. But the Spaniard soon satisfied the King of Britain with the like honour of an Embassy to him directed, and performed by Don Ferdinando Giron, a man eminently fa∣mous and honourable among the chief, and greatest Spanish Commanders. But the Danish Embassadors departed home, wearied out with the tediousness of delayes, and not dis∣sembling, protested, They would not sit idle Spectators of that Play, whose Scene was wholly laid in France. And another thing much increased the cares of the States, which was, That Messengers comming out of France, England, and Ger∣many, all agreed in this point of News, That the Ministers of Spain had declared, That Philip never had any intent to reject or lay aside his right of Dominion, but only for the obtaining of a Treaty, he had given to the Hollanders, the short use of a tempo∣rary Liberty; But now the very inward parts of those Provin∣ces were so well known to him, that he doubted not a good issue ei∣ther in Peace or War: And that of a truth, he would never con∣sent to a Peace, unless they abstained from the Indies, and license given to the Romanist for the exercise of their Religion in their own Way. Janinus returning to the Hague, reported the faithful in∣tent of the King towards them his Allyes, and how he had refused Toledo's troublesome Requests and Offers, but no∣thing further. After this the Enemies Legats (while Naya
was yet absent, but having received Letters out of Spain), give account, That the King did bona fide grant them their Liberty, and therefore it was but just that they on their part should submit to him in the matter of the Indies, and other things ely demanded; Moreover, That the King desired out of h  inclination, That it might be allowed to the Romanists to worship God according to the dictates of their Conscience; They should grant this for their Kindreds sake, they should grant it for their Ancestors sakes, lest they should with greater cruelty hate the Religion by them approved, then that new Opinion of the Ana∣baptists, born for the destruction of Empires; and lastly, They should grant it for their Countreyes sake, lest they should drive from thence all the Inhabitants, by debarring them from that which is most pleasant to mortalls. The States looked upon this as an Engine intended to sub∣vert the Foundations of the Commonwealth; the same was the Opinion of the Germans and English. Janinus did not had fault with the Counsel, but with the Authors thereof, for so great an Affair ought not to be made beneficial by the Enemy. At length, the States finding that these delayes were dangerous to their Affairs, and not willing any longer to hearken to the Enemies unreasonable propositions, resolve to set an end to the Treaty; and to that end a Decree being drawn up, wherein was set forth, by how great and many ex∣periments they had been terrified from Treating of a Peace with the Spaniard, insomuch that when they were first sent to about it, they immediately declared their minds, on the other side, how the Enemy, and with what treachery he brought to effect his designs, how every of their demands would destroy the right and power of their so often granted Liberty; and lastly, they repeated the whole series of the Affair, as the same had been transacted. The Spaniards, this Decree being delivered to them, require a time to deli∣berate thereupon.
In the interim, the Ambassadors of France and Britain, the Germans being rather present then approving, go unto the Assembly of the States, and there produce their Masters Instructions to them, till that time concealed; namely, That they would endeavour by all means possible to make Peace, but if that could not be effected, they should at least perswade boh parties to the making of a Truce, yet such as should be safe and honourable for the Hollanders, and by which their Libety should remain without question, their right of Na∣vigation be preserved entire, and their possessions in no man∣ner diminished. That such a Truce might be brought to a Peace, if the Governors of the Commonwealth behaved themselves with discretion; That they well knew what just causes the Hollanders had of being enraged against their Enemies, but all perturbations of mind are enemies to wholesome Counsel. They should consider with themselves how unfit they were for War of themselves, and that Kings are not wont to take Arms, unless upon just occasion or ne∣cessity. Here nothing more could be expected from the War then mutual damage, and there could be no pretence of necessity, as long as a Truce might be had. If they agreed, the same assistance should be given for defence of the Truce, as was promised if a Peace were concluded; but if the Spa∣niard, which was most of all to be feared, should refuse a Truce, as he had done a Peace, then the Kings their Masters would cordially support the safety of their Friends and Al∣lyes for the future. As soon as same had blown abroad these things, immedi∣ately an unrestrayned liberty of dispersing among the vul∣gar, books written, but without the Authors Name, and this humour spread all about with great heat the whole year. Some foretelling from such a League, solitude, sedition, and last of all slavery. Others with much rancour ripped up all that ever the Spaniards had done in America, their cruelties to the people of Granado and Arragon: And lastly, their
Their Treacheries and Barbarismes committed in the Ne∣therlands: A third sort produced Books that shewed all the Articles prejudicial to the Romane Religion, or that main∣tained it was not necessary to observe or perform Cove∣nants entred into between a Prince and his Subjects: Nor did they omit to find fault, That they were not any Gover∣nours of Cities, nor any of the Native Noblemen that were sent to Treat, but Italians, Spaniards, Monks, the most cun∣ning and deceitful sort of men, who if they could find any thing infirm, or hurtful to the State, they would not leave it undone; nay, they would endeavour by gifts to tempt the Ambassadors of Kings, but the most powerful of the Nobi∣lity, to turn aside from the right, and walk with them in ob∣lique and indirect wayes. I esteem this none of the least evils of that Common∣wealth, That so great perversness should be stirred up in the common people, which had often been forbidden, and then was also by a new Edict, yet could not be repressed, while a sharp and diligent search, and other more grievous punish∣ments were not permitted, as being contrary to Liberty. And now an unexpected accident happened to the States, though in their General Assembly, and upon the presumpti∣on and hope of Peace, they suffered themselves with diffi∣culty to be drawn to hearken to a Truce; yet that they might not seem to despise the advice of the Kings, as it was the chief cause that induced them thereto; yet there were other, to wit, that the Charge of the War, as it had been of late managed, would every Moneth exceed the money rai∣sed by Tributes, above three hundred thousand Florens, and that that sum would not yet be sufficient, unless for the defence of the Rivers, there were added to the old Forces, six thousand Footmen, whereby the whole Commonwealth of the ƲNITED STATES would be indebted,
nine thousand Millions of Flotens, and the single Provinces particularly, twice as much: so that without the consent and help of the Kings their Allyes, the War could not be mana∣ged with any good hope; for to cut off any parts of the Go∣vernment, and only defend the more inward parts, would be an act of cruelty, although there were some that advised it, and would be very dangerous if it should be known abroad; and whereas some said, That the Commonwealth was so consti∣tuted, that it could not be at Peace, though Arms were laid aside, That was by others accounted an impious and infamous con∣fession. It might more justly be feared, Lest the Common People, understanding that just and fair Terms were refused, growing displeased with their Governours, should deny to bear the Charge and Burden of the War. And therefore at last they returned answer, That they were ready to hearken to a Truce, so as their LIBERTY might be confirmed, not under any Conditions, or for a certain time, but really, and for ever. But the Spaniards, when the Ambassadors of the said Kings came to them, gave no hopes of any such Agreement, but offered another. Condition, which was, That all Affairs should continue in the same posture they were at present, with a Cessation of Arms for seven years, yet so as the Spa∣niard might choose within two Moneths, whether he would admit the Indian Commerce, or would contest the right thereof by Arms. But there was no cause why the Grant once already made concerning Liberty, should be again rei∣terated, in regard it would be a difficult thing to be obtained, because the Spaniard is of a more harsh nature, nor will be drawn to imitate the Archdukes facility: And if the States were not pleased with these offers, they desired they might have time given to them till the Calends of October, to ex∣pect the more pleasing Orders of King Philip.
This when it was refused, both by the Ambassadors of Kings and Princes in the Publick Council, the States resol∣ved to persist, and stand to their first Decree; but as to the matter of time desired by the Ambassadors, they said they were ready to consent. In the interim, the Deputies had time every one to return to his own Province, to receive new Instructions concerning this new Affair. And it was agitated with great contention: Nor did the People that lay more open to the Oppressions of the Enemy only dissent from the Zelanders, who were guarded by the Sea, but in Holland it self, several Cities were of several minds, nor within the Cities were all men of one Opinion, but every one moved as his proper hopes led him, or as they were drawn by more powerful Arguments on either side. In this wavering of mens minds, counsel was given to Prince Maurice, That he should openly, and without dissimu∣lation, make Himself the Author of the stronger Opinion, which he did, not only with sharp words, but by Letters sent to the Cities of Holland; At length (saith he), The Arts fea∣red by our Ancestors are burst out: Those specious words, wherewith they purchased a Treaty, were indeed nothing but words, nor was Peace desired by the Enemy, but that he might make War more at his own, then our conveniency; or that he might trouble the Commonwealth more grievously by discords and bribes, then he could do by War. In a short time his Wealth will encrease anew, which lately was ex∣hausted, so that he will make his brass money of equal value with Gold and Silver. But our burdens shall continue, for fear of Treachery. Merchandice and whatever was nou∣rished by War, will be scattered abroad, and the chief flower of our Militia, especially the Horse, will go to other parts, to seek, and gain, both Honour and Booty:
Sloth will not only seize our Bodies, but our Minds, when the Memory of former Injuries shall grow obsolete; where∣of, at present, there remains but a small sign, such having succeeded in the places of former Senators, who only hear of former Actions, and give little Credit to what they hear. Behave your selves so, as it may never be hoped, that any one in the Commonwealth, should regard any thing besides the Commonwealth. 'Tis true, the Motion of Kings are sud∣dain, while people often perish by their long Deliberations. Wherefore, call to mind the Fortitude of your Ancestors, who many times avoided Embassies for Peace, hoth from the Emperour, and other Princes, looking up on them not as Ad∣vice from loving Friends, but as I reacherous Snares cast out by the Enemy to intrap them: Remember those Decrees, which were formerly made, and since often renewed, of set∣ling your Liberty without any Controversie, admit of no Articles, no Conditions, but such as shall absolutely debar the Enemy, not only from the Right of Government, but from using or claiming any Title or Token thereof: If there be no Fraud intended, why do they delay to express in plain words, what is seriously intended. Certainly, it behoves you so to do, as neither Forein Princes may doubt of your Condition, nor the very Citizens and Subjects begin to think of nominating among themselvs a New Lord. There will be some, that will cry up to you ambiguous Speeches, and such Language as re∣lisheth with the Spaniard, and will pretend a necessity of your admitting thereof: But, be assured, honest and whole∣some Counsels, need not the Patronage of Necessity, such Curiosity is rash, and draws only to a Rendition of Liber∣ty. If my Counsel be follow'd, there shall be an absolute League or nothing; And if I have not merited sufficiently, I am sure my Father did. The Business in Agitation, concerns not me or mine singly; and if my Heart would have suffer'd
me to have private Interest, before publike Advantage, there might formerly have been, and may still be seen, a commo∣dious and beneficial Issue by War. You are the Princes and Heads of the Union give Example to your Inferiours, and let the wavering people be setled by your Authority. Consult of what the Senate lately proposed as necessary for the Common∣wealth; Whoever you send to the Assembly, be sure to bind them up by your Commands, that in the Articles concern∣ing Liberty, they may not alter one Tittle: Command them to communicate Counsels with Us concerning the Common∣wealth, as was formerly done towards antient Governours, and particularly towards my Father: Such your Care for the pub∣like Safety, I shall gratefully accept, and with all kind∣ness. The Interpretation of these Letters was not alike in all places; some of the Magistrates of Cities, that were wont to go to the General Assembly looking upon the same, as if their Fidelity had bin traduced among their Colleagues, in the per∣formance of their Commands. About this time were produ∣ced also the Letters of Justus Lipsius, elsewhere remembred by us; whereby, being a man skill'd in Civil Affairs, he be∣came the Author of the Spaniards making a Truce with the Hollander. Princes, by delay, many times gather strength; and, as Hatred decayeth, Obedience returneth. Sextus Pompeius of old fell by no other policy, while he was Lord not only of an Island, but a strong Fleet. Now was September, the time limited for the stay of the Spaniards, past; and therefore they go to the King's Embas∣sadors, who declared, They had received the Arch-Dukes In∣structions, whereby power was given to them of making a Truce in Europe for 7 years, in this form, to wit, To agree with the States as free, and over whom they arrogated no power; and they promised, that they would endeavour to obtain King Philip's Consent to the same. But the said Embassadors denied
to discourse with the States concerning a matter, which be∣fore-hand they knew would not be acceptable; and it ap∣pear'd, that the Spaniards were offended with the Severity of the last Decree, whereby they were commanded to depart the Borders of Holland, that they esteem'd it contrary to their Honour and Greatness to desire a longer stay; yet they would very willingly have continued there, if the States had voluntarily, or by the perswasion of other Prince's Embassa∣dors granted the same. But it was more providently consider'd by the same Em∣bassadors, to satisfie the States Anger, by the Enemies De∣parture, than to incur their Hatred themselves, by so ill-resent∣ed a Desire. Wherefore, the Spaniards came into the Coun∣cil, to take their leave of the States, where Don Richardot, highly applauding his Princes, who had pardon'd the greatest Affonts for gaining of Peace, he accused the obstinate per∣versness of the States; by whom also, they were at that time dishonourably driven out of their Borders. I am (saith he) no Prophet; but either I am vehemently deceived, or else I fore∣see the Day, when you will in vain wish, that you might have those things which you now refuse: By your neglect of Peace, you shall hereafter be accounted guilty of all the Blood that shall be shed. Hereto Olden Barneveldt thus answer'd in the Name of the States; That they had acted with all plainness and simpli∣city; for they would not admit a Treaty, without an assurance, that their Liberty should be absolutely confirmed to them: That the fault of not making a League lay at their Doors, who either would not, or could not, perform their Promises: From them the Blood would be required, whose Laws being more cruel and bloo∣dy than War, had inforced a Necessity of using Arms; for that there remained fresh Examples of their Barbarism against neak Sea-men, and silly Fisher-men. During these Discourses, Spinola stood by with a Counte∣nance, wherein might easily be discover'd the grief of a hope∣less
Peace. And soon after Richardot, whether by Chance, or out of Design, is uncertain, left behind him in the Inne, among some other Papers, the private Instructions of the Arch-Dukes, of the method of holding and managing the Treaty; which being found, were soon after publish'd to the Vulgar. Herein all Things, which we have before-mention'd, of the Transactions of Peace, were set down in the same order as they were done; and among the rest, That they should not at all contest the Article concerning Liberty: But if they would not restore the Rights belonging to the Prince's Revenue, in been thereof, they should demand a summe of Money to be paid yearly▪ and when they had happily brought to pass the rest, then they should craftily insinuate to the Hollanders, how potent the Body of the Netherlands would be, if it were united; where as being divided and torn asunder, they might easily become a Prey to some Foreiner: That therefore they would do well, if they would choose the Arch-Dukes for their Defenders, or at least would enter into such a Society, that who offended either, should be ta∣ken as Enemy to both: And if that could not be obtained, yet they should endeavour that it might be agreed, That neither Party should assist the others Enemies, either by Counsel, or otherwise, or suffer any of their Subjects to take Arms on their behalf. And the Spaniards were Commanded to conceal these Instructions from the French and English, yet in other Things to use their Help and Counsel; and especially the Advice of Janinus, for obtaining a Toleration of the Romane Religion, and part of the Goods heretofore belonging to the Priesthood. The Earl of Frizelands Business also was com∣mended to them, and some other private Matters.
They that would not believe this Writing was carelesly left behind by Richardot, suspected this might be some Reason why he left them, to wit, that the States thereby might be perswaded there was nothing acted concerning their liberty, but what was serious, and should put into the Hollanders minds, the thoughts of an Auxiliary League, which had been unreasonable to have spoken of. They that published that Paper, desired that the Embassadors of Frances Counsels chiefly, might be suspected, or to make the Arch Dukes subject to the more violent hatted of the Kings▪ however it was, Richardot by Letters, both accused his own negligence, and complained, that the Laws of Hospitality, were violated, in that a private Writing belonging to him, was published to all the People: Nevertheless, the Embas∣sadors of France and England, (the Germans, to whom that action was very displeasing, preparing for their departure) knowing by some late speeches, and now by Don Richardots Letters, that a Truce for ten years might be obtained from Albertus and Philip, but that no other words would be granted touching their liberty, than those had been at first used at the beginning of the Cessation of Arms, framed a League according to that method. Concerning the Indies, it was admired, that King Philip might chuse whether he would have a Truce there, or War, but as to the Borders, and other controverted points, they were reserved for the future, to a more peaceable Treaty; The greatest Labour was, that this method of Agreement, might be approved by the States, who were solicitous to con∣firm their liberty for ever; some also willing to lay hold on this occasion, utterly to subvert the League, and therefore the Embassadors came into the Councel, of whom Janinus, ha∣ving setled himself into a Senatorian Gravity, began thus to speak.
The Dignity and Vertue of them, who are displeased with our Counsels for a Truce, merits, that their Arguments should be composed with ours whereby it may appear to you, worthy Patriots, whether is more wholsome and sound Counsel: I hear they find fault with words, which if they do, that their liberty may be pre∣served, and a pretence is not sought, out of a desire of War, it is, that they may be freed from a prayse-worthy perchance, yet an pty fear▪ for liberty is numbred among those things, which receive neither time nor condition, and being once given, can never be recalled: Although if we rightly consider the matter, you de∣sire not your Liberty to be given to you but only to be acknowledged: Neither indeed can he give it, It being denyed, that a Prince can transpose his Government, and it would be a shame for you, to re∣ceive that as given, which by publick Decree, you obtained long since; And 'tis not possible to acknowledge it more plainly, than by calling you Free, and professing, that they arrogate no Authority to themselves over you: This seems enough to Us, for the settle∣ment of peace in self; but because some thought more might be ob∣tained, we have not interposed: But to relinquish the Titles and Ensigns of Honour, seemed even to us, reproachful and infamous, and therefore well to be suspected by a King unconquered: But say they, If the Enemy think so, why doth he not declare himself freely? Why, it may be, he thinks it unreasonable and unjust, to be compelled to use other words, then such as were satis∣factory to you before the Treaty: And now, who would you have believe your liberty? Is it the Kings your Allies? Cer∣tainly, those words will be satisfactory to them: Nor do you fear, I believe, that the Spaniard would offer to lay his hand of Au∣thority over you, and should require to be revenged on you: But a Truce being finished, if he shall so think meet, he shall make use of War, as a Judge: No caution can defend the Conquered, and the Reason will easily appear, why Victorious Arms cannot be limited: Nor is it greatly to be feared, that the Enemy can heap up any great store of Wealth: That is the Custom of free People,
and such as require nothing but their own, to look at the future, whereas it is frequent with Kings only to mind the present, some being destroyed with boundless desires of luxurious living, others wasted with the ambition of wide extended Dominions. King Philip is a young Man, and Governs a Nation, that cannot be taught quietness: It is more easie for you to renew your Credit, having payd your debts, where Garrisons onely remaining the charge of Fortifications, which are the greatest part of your burdens, will cease. You may now defer your Tributes during the years of the Truce. The Enemies gifts and dissentions. I will ea∣sily grant to those who say they fear those things whereof they ought to take heed: I know you neither want Laws, nor Judiciall Pro∣ceedings, and it will be but a vain thing, to seek to corrupt a few, where the Government remains in the als of many, and they not always the same. And the Enemy himself will shake off shath, being of that nature that cannot so behave himself, as to continue long unsuspected: Otherwise, if that Reason be admitted you must of necessity, undertake a perpetuall War. In Peace the vices of Security are much more to be feared, nor want there in War pe∣culiar dangers, especially, where any great Calamity makes a breach upon obedience; Nor is that much to be feared, when the publick Revenues are so unable to begin a War, that they cannot keep it off, that is, as to the averting the rune. This Advan∣tage you have, that it is in your own power, to take heed of the discommodities of a Truce: Many times, the wisest mn cannot escape the sad events of War. There lies upon us also the necessity of answering Lipsius his Letters, who perswades the Enemy to a Truce, though but for a short time, and without the mention of Liberty. If they require Examples, we have many, and those not of former, but of the pre∣sent Age: Holland and Zeland gained a new life from the League made at Gaunt: The Switzers that took Arms for the like Causes, laid them down upon a Truce, and have now for a long time retained their Liberty, being defended by their Foot
Souldiers chiefly, and the heights of their Mountains; And wherein, I pray, are you less able to defend your selves, being so powerful at Sea, and having the Ocean for a Guard: Some in∣deed fear, lest you should return to your Arms more weak and ef∣feminate, for the lives of Princes that favour you, (say they) are uncertain; But let them know, that the causes of Allyance and Friendship, doth not decay with the Kings, but remain as immor∣tall as the Kingdoms themselves. This is that makes Allyes live and flourish, and let this prevail to stir you up, not to let slip so reasonable a time to acquire peace: This Advice prceeds from Kings your Friends, whose careful providence, chiefly ayms at this, that you may be safe: More might be said to this purpose, but I think it prudence to say no more: Let every one answer for himself: only let not the Authours of the contrary Opinion over∣come us in the liberty of saying what they please. The next day he sets upon them again, their minds being already moved with the former Oration, and runs over the principal Heads of the League, one by one, that he might convince them, that there was nothing couched therein, ei∣ther unjust or deceitful: and when he had so done, added, that They were the first of all People, to whom that Honour had been granted, to confirm their liberty by the Confession of the rejected and abjured Prince: The Switzers could not obtain so much nor could the like be forced by the Victo∣rious Danes, from their King Christierne, though a Captive to them; and thereupon, he grievously blamed them with ac∣cusations of ingratitude and falsity, because they had whis∣pered, that by the coming of Don Pedro de Toledo, into France, the King was become averse to the Hollanders Com∣modity. But His Majesties good will to them, was more firmly setled, then to be changed by the desires of their Ene∣mies, or any thing else, save the contumely of such as dis∣persed abroad such falsities.
Winwood also thought it a part of his duty, to commend a Truce to the Senate, whereof he himself was a member, af∣firming, that his Master the King of Great Britain, would not perswade them to any thing, but what he himself would give an Example of: Those Arms are just, that are neces∣sary; and those not onely pious Kings, but God himself would favour: but they are not necessary, to which there is a way open to an honourable end. If they subsisted by extraordinary succour, yet they ought not to refuse the making of a League, since both their Religion, Liberty and Commerce, might be preserved. But now it was to far distant, to conjecture what would come to passe after a Truce, by how much they could not discern the nearer dangers of War. It was a wonder to see with what greatness of mind, the business was transacted at every Assembly, and new Books were daily set forth as it were, to sow and foment discords; for now they spared neither of the Kings: as if the chief of their hopes had consisted in the miseries of the Confederate States. But the chief of their envy was vented against Ol∣denbarneveldt, as the Inventor of such things: He being grown odious to men of the greatest quality, and most emi∣nent degree by his excessive Authority, much less could his Equalls endure to see him so far in Honour above them, in∣somuch, that there were some Letters found, wherein he was not obscurely destined to slaughter: Whereupon, He in the Assembly of the States of Holland, protesting, that he had not feared to draw upon himself, the malice of the most po∣tent men, nor shunned any dangers, so as He might serve his Country, being fraught with the Solace of a quiet Consci∣ence against all scandalous Rumours, and unlucky accidents; But when he saw a thing in it self displeasing to him, yet ne∣vertheless be aggravated to make him odious, He beseeched them, that for expediting those things they should see fit in the Common-wealth, they would appoint others to officiate,
that were less hated: which said, immediately he departed from the Assembly: Some of the Lords were sent after him, to desire him, that he would not in this nice Juncture of time, desert the Common-wealth, which he had hitherto assist∣ed with his faithful Counsels. Hereupon, returning to his accustomed charge, sometimes extolling the benefits and Authority of the Kings, anon explicating, and laying open the charge of the War, he confirmed such as wavered and re∣futed them without anger, although they were very sharply contradicted, and Amsterdam it self a long time resisted, at length, he brought all Holland to one mind; which also five other of the Provinces soon after embraced. Only Zeland, out of some peculiar Reasons of their own, and by the insti∣gation of Prince Maurice, resisted the consent of all the rest, denying to agree to a Truce, nor would suffer the Decree to be revoked, urging the words of the Trajectine League, that Arms should not be laid down, unless by the common con∣sent of all, and whatever difference should arise among the Provinces, should be left to the decision of the Gover∣nours. Others were angry, and said, the Question was not now concerning a Truce, but whether Zeland alone, should give the Law to all the rest; And now the Contest among them growing hot, the Embassadors of the Kings interposed, en∣deavouring to drive those by force of Arguments, whom they could not lead by perswasion. And first Janinus, producing to the States, King Henrics Letters, wherein he ratified whatever they should say or do, began to praise the good & benefit of Concord; then mentio∣ning divers Opinions without frowardness, when he came to the Trajectine League, he said, it belongs not to us, to inter∣pret the Laws of other People; but yet common Reason teacheth, that at this time, the Debate was upon a yielding not an indifferent League; and it any think otherwise, the Law is either to be abrogated, or laid aside, the Publick
Weal so requiring, which contains in it the Sanctimony of all Laws; for what other event will produce, if these do not refuse the decision of the Kings their Allyes, more justly than those the determination of the Governours, but that upon this Consultation, both must needs run into facti∣ous parties, it remains therefore, that the fewer in number should yield to the greater; for by this means alone, stands the Government of People, which otherwise would decay, and fall to ruine. Thus among the Switzers, the Decrees of the greater Party are obeyed by those who contradicted the same; But the Acheans and Aetolians, though valiant people, yet were destroyed by dissention, while each of them would not agree to consult with the other; for too much liberty is the ready way to Servitude: Besides, that no man may feed himself with a vain hope, I now by Command declare, that the King hath no such need of you, as to give assistance to those that despise his Counsels. Spencer also in the name of his Master the King of Great Brittain, spoke to the same purpose, adding, that the Com∣mon-wealth, wherein the right of many Opinions doth not prevail, is like to a Virgin, which as old Authours remember, was pulled in pieces by the hands of many other rivall Lo∣vers contending among themselves, and so elegantly set forth, how much the Tribunitial Power prejudiced the Ro∣mans. The same Embassadors also perswaded them for the future, to settle a more certain Method of raising their Tributes; as also if any thing were distempered in the Common-wealth, or disfigured by War, that it might be amended, whereby they might become more unanimous among themselves, and more formidable to their Enemies. The like Advice they gave to the Citizens, who esteemed their own Government best, to wit, that they should leave
the chief Matters to their Provincces and their Deputies; but all suddain and quotidian Business should be in the or∣dering of the Governours and Senate, who were to look after, not any particular part alone, but the whole Body: But it was not convenient to abolish a Custom approved of by the space of Twenty Years, with Success fortunate enough; wher∣by it easily appear'd, that it would be profitable for all, that all Things should remain as at present; lest, while the De∣bate of the Truce depended, they should involve and in∣tangle one Business in another. In these Verbal Contentions, this Transient Year was al∣most expired, and a Rumour was frequently spread abroad, That the Truce endeavour'd by the Embassadors, did no whit please the Spaniards: And the Truth is, Richardot had writ∣ten to Janinus, That King Philip was grown more averse than before; but he assigned the fault thereof to the King of Great Brit∣tain, as if he had given some hope, that nothing more should be spo∣ken of Liberty. And now the sweetness of Peace had so far allured some among the Ʋnited States, that they could digest that, but the more discreet sort wthstood it; and the Embassadors of the Kings sent to the Arch-Dukes, demanding, Whether they should give Credit to those things, which of late had been begun to be transacted with their Ministers: Upon Return of their Messenger, being certified, That the Arch-Dukes had given Command, and likewise had from the King a power of ma∣king an Agreement, they shew'd the same to the States, and admonish them, That the Cessation of Arms being near a con∣clusion, should be prolonged for one Moneth, in hope of making a League: Yet lest they should expect other Articles, than what had bin of late prescribed by them. They said. They would only do their Endeavour, that the Truce might continue for 7 years longer, and that there might rather be a peaceable than a Warlike Trade in the Indies. In the mean while, the Arch-Dukes well understanding, that there wanted not some in
Spain, who either desirous of War, or striving for the honour of the Kingdom, would dispute those Words concerning the Liberty of the Hollanders; especially, because the Hollan∣ders would not leave the Trade of the Indies, nor would suf∣fer any thing to be Decreed in favour of the Romanists: Therefore they sent thither Inicus, a Priest of Bruxels, of a Noble Spanish Family, and Father Confessour to Albertus: and which is of necessary consequence with the same, inti∣mate and privy to all his Counsels. This Man was command∣ed to shew, what Commodities would, by a Truce, accrue to the Ports of Flanders, the passage to which was stopped up by War; as also, that some increase of the Romane Religion was to be hoped, by as much as Hatred and Animosities de∣creased, they being a People covetous of Novelty, and dis∣cordant in Matters of Divinity. Neither were those Words much to be fear'd, that were ambiguously implyed, the Em∣bassadors of the Kings not only averting, They would take nothing away from the Spaniard, but that many of the Hol∣landers had shew'd them to be fruitless by subtilly cavilling: That these Arguments might prevail against all contrary Attempts and Endeavours, they were strengthned by the Authority of the Duke of Lerma, a Man most eminent in the Favour of King Philip; and therefore drawing after him, not onely the Respect of the Court, but the whole Source of Counsel; he delighted much in the pleasures of Peace, and therefore fear'd, lest others should over-top him by Honour and Renown gain'd in War. This Year came Philip William Prince of Aurange, and Elder Brother to Prince Maurice, first of all into Holland, re∣maining other where during the time of War, but now using the common freedom taken by all: The causes of his com∣ming thither he pretended, That by the Truce, he might take a Care to mind the benefit of his own Affairs; as also, that being honour'd with the French Affinity, he hoped he might the better bring it about by means of the present
French Embassadors, those Things which were in dispute be∣tween him and his Brothers, concerning his Paternal Inheri∣tance: But others interpreted it in another manner, as if he had appear'd there as a Fautor of Peace, contrary to the Counsels of his Brother: However it was, this is certain, That by his means, Emanuel of Portugal, against whom we elsewhere mention'd Prince Maurice to be highly inraged, for his Marriage with his Sister, was reconcil'd to the House of Nassau. During all this time, nothing was done by the Souldiery, but only near Ardenburg some were slain, that lay in wait to take away the Townsmens Cattel: Likewise in Germany, the Hollanders Horse, with more than ordinary Licentious∣ness, foraging the Country, were met with and punish'd; for some being sent out of the Garrison at Berck, slew some of them as they were scatter'd abroad in the Night, among whom was kill'd Adolphus of Nassau, a Young-man of great Courage, but too indulgent to the Souldiery: But the Victors Joy continued but a while; for the Troops gathering toge∣ther from all parts, repai'd the slaughter of their Compani∣ons, with the Death of many more of their Enemies. This Year also there appear'd the Seeds of a Mischief that was not contemptible; for Arms were scarce laid aside, before there began a Difference in Religion; the beginnings whereof are not known, nor more of it, but as it broke out by little and little, which hapned thus: At Leyden, two fa∣mously learned Men; the one, named Gomarus; the other, Arminius, publikely read Lectures upon the Holy Scriptures; of whom this maintain'd, That by God's Eternal Decree, it was appointed, who should be saved, and who should be damned; and thereupon, that some are drawn to Piety, and being so drawn, are preserved, that they shall not fall away, while others are left to perpetrate the common Vices of Mankind, and lie totally involved in their own sins. This, on the other side, maintain'd, That God would not be altogether a severe Judge, but was also a lo∣ving
Father; and made this difference of Sinners, That to such as were weary of sinning, and could put their Confidence in Christ, he would give Pardon and Life; but to the Obstinate Punishment; and that it was well-pleasing to God, that all should repent; and having learned better things, should be held up from falling back; but that no man was to be compelled. These Two accused each other sharply; Arminius bla∣ming Gomarus, that he ascribed to God the Causes of Sinne, and by a strong perswasion made Mens Minds obstinue: And Gomarus finding fault with Arminius, that he fill'd men with Arrogance, far more than the Decrees of the Romanists, and would not suffer a good Conscience, which is a Man's greatest Concern, to be acceptable to God. It appears by those, who have with Care perused Antient Authors, that the Primitive Christians granted, That Man had Free-will, as well in receiving, as in retaining Discipline: from whence proceeds the Equity both of Rewards and Punishments: Neither yet did they omit to refer all things to the Divine Goodness, by whose Gift the wholesom Seed of Goodness came to us, and of whose singular Assistance, all our Dangers have need. Augustine first of all (from whence arose a sharp Dispute between him and Pelagius, with those that follow'd him, and he himself also formerly had thought otherwise) so Relin∣quished that Name of Liberty, that he preferred before it certain of God's Decrees, which seemed utterly to overthrow the same; But all over Greece and Asia, the antient and more plain Opinion was, retained. In the Western part of the World, the great and famous Name of Augustine drew many to consent to him, though some were found in France, and elsewhere, that opposed the same. In after-Ages, when the School hardly made use of any other Doctor than Augustine, it was disputed between the Franciscans and Dominicans, what was his sence, what was the right way of reconciling those Things that seem'd so
repugnant; and the most Learned of the Jesuits labour'd with more curious Subtilty, to unty the Knot; till being accused at Rome, they hardly escaped punishment. But Luther, the Father of the Protestants, going out of a Monastery, that as well bore the Name of Augustine, as fol∣low'd his Opinion, taking up the Bucklers in the same Cause, began to hew down, what remain'd of the Name of Free-will: Which seem'd so abominable to Erasmus, that having either approved, or at least passed over with silence the rest of his Doctrines, he opposed himself to this: By whose Arguments Philip Melancthon, an Assistant to Luther, being mov'd, recanted what he had formerly written; and was the Author, why Luther (as many believe, and is certain∣ly evident to the Lutherans) deserted his Rigid Decrees, that would admit of no Condition; yet so, that they rather abhorred the Name of Free-will, than the Thing it self. But in another party of the Protestants, their Leader Cal∣vin, adhering to the first Opinions of Luther in this Con∣troversie, strengthned and upheld the same with new Ar∣guments, and added to Augustine, what had never been touched on before, That a true and saving Faith was perpe∣tual, and could not be lost; whereof, whoever was Conscious to himself, that he possessed the same, he might even then assure him∣self of Eternal Felicity; yet did not deny, but that in the inte∣rim, they might fall into grievous sins. The Rigor of this Opinion was increased at Geneva, by Beza; in Germany by Zanchius, Ursinus, Piscator; who often∣times lanched out so far, that sometime they would publike∣ly deliver, what others had so carefully avoided; to wit, That the Necessity of sinning, did depend from the first cause: which gave the Lutherans an ample occasion of Quarrel, and especially a new occasion of Contention arising about the Eucha∣charist. At the beginning it was to some purpose, to contend up∣on these Differences of disturbed Religion among the Hollan∣ders,
although it was easie, among so many people differing in Opinions, that it might be argued with equal Justice: But when many young Folks coming from being taught by Geneva, Palatine and Nassauian Doctors, began to collect themselves together, and get the ordering of several Chur∣ches, they supposed it time, to broch that which they had learned, and maintain the same as infallible, striving either not to admit any publike Dissenters into their Congregation, or to participate of the Divine Ordinances; or else, being ad∣mitted, to exclude them at pleasure: Whereupon many Com∣plaints were made to the States by divers, protesting, That theso Doctrines were openly, and without any questioning, taught in Gelderland by Anastatius Welauseu; in Frizeland, by Gellius Suecanus; at Utrecht, by Hubertus; among the Hol∣landers, by Hiltam, Cleracus Martius, Herman Herbert, and others. Thus these Matters proceeded, until the two great Champions mention'd before, Gomarus on one side and Ar∣minius on the ther, met in the Schools at Leyden, each to con∣firm his own Opinion, and subvert the others. The Dissentions of the Masters broke out among the Scho∣lars, so that now other Ministers and Divines in Holland were call'd to take parties: The States thought fit that they should meet, and commanded the Supream Session of the Judges to hear the two Professors: After a long Contest, it seem'd convenient, that all the Acts of the Dispute should be buried in silence: yet both Parties nevertheless publish'd all, and that pleased the Ministers as the most customary; this, the Magistrates, as the most popular Opinion: And from hence arose a new Contention, when these averted, That the Judgment and setling of Religion, was a part of Supream Magi∣stracy or Government: Those, That Divine Things ought only to be Debuted in Sacred Assemblies. This brought forth two Books; one, appointing a way for Instruction of Youth in the Netherlands, in Matters of Piety, according to the Ex∣ample of the Palatinae: The other, wherein the Profession
of the Reformed Churches, while the King of Spain Ruled heretofore, was declared; and these added new matter of Controversie. And the United States, upon Request made to them, That out of the Seven Provinces, the several Ministers might be called into an Assembly, consented, upon this condition, That in that Assembly, the said two Books might be examined, according to the Rule of the Holy Text. This, They that took part with Goma∣tus, attributed to the Policy of those that dissented from them, as if they would, that should be a sign to all that desired Novelty: Themselves praising that Custom approved in all Ages, that the Bonds of Consent should not rashly be dissolved; for otherwise, the Minds of the common People would be divided, according as any one would teach his Fantasies; and therefore it was fit, some we should attend Ecclesiastical Matters, unless being concerned in those Books, they judged it unjust and dangerous. But they that held with Arminius, said, It was no fault to doubt of Hu∣mane Writings; that in so great a Matter, it was not so lawful a deliberation that was Tumultuary, as that which is done by the Governours of a Common-wealth; And that it did better consist with Christianity, either to use none, or at leastwise shorter Forms. Moreover, about this time a small Book came forth at Gonde, containing Matters to be believed by few, yet in the same Words which are prescribed in Holy Writ: Presently there appear'd some from another Company, who publikely detested this, saying, There was no so portentous and horrid Opinion, which might not be hidden under such Words: That the simplicity of the Primitive Times was praise-wor∣thy, when yet unknown Evils wanted no Remedies; but soon after, as every Age was more fertile in Errour, so there were found certain manners of speaking, that might drive all that went astray from their lurking places: By which means they became servile, while these enjoy'd Peace and Quiet, which they nick-named Liberty, these truly call'd Perturba∣tion and Faction: until on both sides, by famous Names, the
differences were encreased, which afterwards gave both name and nourishment to greater feuds. From the East this year also came Capt. Mateliseu, all things there being in a happy condition, which without doubt might be some reason, why the Spaniard would not the decision of the Indian Trade to War. He went out three years and three Moneths before, when the Spring was too far spent, to suffer him to escape those annual Southerly blasts under the Equinoctial, driving him to the Coasts of Africa. He had many and great commands for War; But the Seamen resi∣sted his Authority, murmuring that they were not to perform the Duties of Souldiers. The Captain himself being ambitious of honour, allured the most potent in the society, with the hope of renown, and the Commons with the hope of prey, now speaking to all in general, anon to particular men, as occasion offered it self, and giving exhortations to every one according to his disposition. When he came to the Indies, they took some Portugall Ships, and other that assisted them in Merchandi∣sing; but the Barbarians in them were all set at Liberty, that they might the better acquire their good will. Malacca is seated upon the right Angle of the gulf of Bengala, where Sumatra shadows the Indian Continent, it is a great Island divided by a narrow branch of the Sea, which is called there Cincapura. Jora is not far distant, whose Kings formerly possessed Malacca; but after the Portugueses came into that World, being invited by the scituation of the place, they built there a Castle upon a little hill, encompassed with a square Wall, and some houses within it, and taking into the same a quan∣tity of ground as seemed sufficient. By little and little they began to dwell without the Wall, and especially beyond the River, that lyes to the right hand; those buildings also that were near the River side, were fenced with a Wall. From hence proceeded a perpetual fed between the Kings of Jo∣ra;
and the Spaniards, and therefore at this time did they first make a League with the Hollanders. At this time four bro∣thers governed Jora, of whom the chief in Authority was na∣med Jandepatuan, but Sabran far excelled him in ingenuity and industry, being very intent, both for the defence and increase of his Government, the contrary whereof it usual in most of the Indian Kings, who rather follow Bacchus and Venus, loving all things that bring delight at the present, and not minding anything of future advantage. Now Mate∣lisen was more able in mind than power to besiege Malacca, for the Castle and Town was kept by Andrea Fartado, a man famous in War, and having with him almost three thou∣sand men; but the greater part of them was Indians, because some Portugueses were sent out of the Garrison with certain Ships to China. In the Holland Fleet, were eleven ships, and fourteen hundred men. Wherefore for augmenting his Forces, he de∣sired aid of the Kings of Jora, making a League, That they should enjoy the Countrey, and the Hollanders the Town, but the Prey to be divided equally between them. Hereupon they be∣gan to shoot, first from the Ships, then from certain little Islands which lay near. Then on the shore to the right hand they pitched their Camp, and suddenly a suburb beyond the River, that might have been defended, was quitted, and a bridg being cut down, the whole defence lay within the Ca∣stle, and the places near adjoyning to the Castle. Thus the Hollanders with safety made another bridg over the River, and so invaded the backside of the Town, and a Monastery defended with a Mount, and in a short time pierced on the other side, even to the Sea. Therefore Matelisen appoints Forts in convenient and fit places, and beats down with the shot of his Great Guns, a Bulwark that Fartado a little be∣fore had added to the Castle, and when the ground that was full of Water, would not suffer the Pioneers to work, ma∣king little wooden Towers, and filling them with earth and
small loppings of Trees (and by chance there were many Orchards near there abouts) he removed nearer to the Castle carrying into that rude and barbarous World, the Political Stratagems of the Netherlandish War. And strange it is to tell, and hard to be believed, that in all that Siege there was no use made of any of the Jorensians, or others whom the Neighbour Kings had sent thither: The first number pro∣mised to send, they performed not, and then in those that came, obedience and constancy was no less wanting, than knowledg in the use of Arms; for they were not only unfit to stand against violent eruptions or sallyes, but at every shot of a Gun, were ready to fly from their appointed stations; so that then it was evident by clear experiments, That the Portugueses had rather made a prey of these Nations, than obtained a Victory. But the Hollander being pressed with the whole burden of the War, partly by accidental misfortunes, and partly by weariness and nocturnal showers, were much diminished and weakened. There was no hope that the besieged being more in number, could be taken by them who were fewer, it remained therefore only to starve them out; but now the Siege having continued four Moneths was broken up by the comming of a Fleet from Goa, which was commanded by Alphouse de Castro, the Kings Pretor in the Indies; this Fleet consisted of fourteen Galeons, four Galleyes, and six∣teen smaller ships, which carryed of Portugueses, and other Europeans, to the number of three thousand seven hundred men, and well nigh as many Barbarian servants. These were commanded, as afterwards was known by some Prisoners and Letters, to invade all the places where the Hollanders were wont to come with Merchandise, particularly, Achem, Jora, Faham, Patan, Bantam, and Amboyna. As they came near Achem, they commanded the King of the City, to pay the Charges of their Fleet, Deliver up the Hollanders, and suffer a Castle to be builded, as if already they had gotten the
Victory. But he being well furnished with Arms and For∣tifications, wherewith he had strengthened the shore, by the directions, of the Hollander, contemned all these threans and cracks; yet the Spaniards broke into one of them, but were repulsed with so great slaughter, that they durst attempt no further. And now the Seige of Malacca coming to their knowledg, they hasten thither, that they might, if possible, surprise the empty Ships, and take the Enemy as he lay scattered on the shore; but Matelisen being forewarned thereof by his Scouts and Spyes, prevented them; and al∣though he were but a raw Souldier, yet he performed the duty of an excellent Captain: for first, he shipped all his Carriages and Guns, then the Jorensian Souldiers, and last of all, as any Hollander was more distant, so he was com∣manded before the others (that lay nearer) to enter the Fort, that was erected on the shore. Now had part of them got∣ten into the ships, and other part was yet on land, when the Enemy made a strong Sally out of Malacca, but they were soon beaten back, and so afterwards the rest with more care got on board. As soon as ever the ships saw each other, they began a Fight with their Great Guns at a distance; the Portugueses avoiding the Fight, because the Wind carryed them to∣wards Sumatra, which was from the Enemy. As soon as day light appeared the next morning, and the Wind began to blow from Sumatra, Matelisen foreseeing the Enemy would press upon him, commanded to weigh Anchor, but one of the ships which was named Nassaw, when it could not stir the Anchor, and delayed to cut their Cables, was set upon by two Spanish Vessels, and burned; but the danger was like to have reached the Authors thereof, if the Galleys had not come in and assisted them, which kind of help the Hollanders wanted, therefore being drawn with ropes fast∣ned to the Galleyes that were rowed, they escaped the fire, that was now ready to seize them: The Holland ships also
attempted to succour their fired Vessels, which were called the Middleburg and the Orange, but the wind presently slacking, hindred their course, and forthwith Alvares Car∣vale, Henry Norone, and Duertes Guerra, Portugal Captains with three ships set upon them; into which being intangled one among another, the Maurice, another Holland ship, cast fire, which utterly consumed Duertes and Carvale, with their ships, and together with them perished the Middleburg. But Matelisen himself with the Admiral, assailed Norom, fighting with the Orange, and so terrified it with shot, that at length the torn Vessel in sign of yielding, took down the Banner: yet for all this, he durst not go among the Portu∣gueses, preparing to receive him, fearing lest any Seaman, the Fight being not yet over, should turn both their hands and minds to Booty, and neglect the Battel. Therefore supposing the ship his own, and commanding the shot to cease, he drew it after him with a rope, but Norone, the Ca∣ble breaking of it self, escaping to his companions, deceived his too careful and unhappy Prudence. But here the Spa∣niard being weary, the Fight began to cease, and the Hollan∣ders took great care that they might not by the swiftness of the Tyde, be separated and driven below the Enemy. The Victory was equal, each side having lost two ships, whereof the Portugueses indeed were the bigger, but the Hollanders loss was the greater, their Fleet being the least. But the loss of men was not equal; for the Hollanders wanted only might, whereas many of the Portugueses perished, both by fire, shot, and in the Sea; besides a great many that were slain by the furious Seamen, contrary to their Captains com∣mand, as they endeavoured to escape from the fire in a small Boat. The next dayes passed in quiet, or at least in the exchange of some few bullets, when the Hollanders be∣gan to want Gunpowder, and which was a greater mischief than that, the obstinacy of the Seamen had well nigh burst put into a sedition; for because by the Law of the society,
the whole Fleet was not intrusted to all, but every one had his own ship delivered to his Trust, they whose ships were burned, as if they therewith had lost their wages, sad and en∣raged, incited others to refuse fighting, with fear of the like loss; therefore for appeasing their minds, as well that their sick men might be refreshed, as their torn ships repaired, Matelisen withdraws with his Fleet to Jora, and there en∣ters into Council with the Kings for strengthening of the Town against any Assaults of the Portugueses. Here while he stayed a Moneth, a joyful Messenger came to him with news, That the Enemy had divided his eet, part of them being gone as a Convoy to the weaker ships, and that there remained at Malacca no more then seven Galleons, and three Galleyes: Wherefore trying the Marriners, sometimes by Threats, sometimes by Promises, he scarsly prevailed with them, Not to let slip out of their hands an occasion so advantagious for the good of their Countrey. When they came to Malacca, and saw the Bies Fleet lye at Anchor, under the Prote∣ction of the Castle; Matelisen, that he might draw them out into the open Sea, made use of this Policy; The outer∣most of the Enemies ships, (being called the Nicholas) Him∣self in the Admiral, and with two other ships, enclosed, and cutting its Anchor Cable with a Rope, drew it along with them into the Main Sea; and because Gunpowder was short with him, he appointed they should not make many shots, but what they did make, to make surely, not aiming at the bottom (because in that calm Sea he could not well drown a ship) but at the hatches and decks, and where-evr they saw the men stand thickest. Then he commands the ship to be immediately entred, and that all they met with should be put to the sword: Nor were the Seamen backward in per∣forming the command, forgetting his Domestick quarrel, as he grew hot with fighting, insomuch that they made a gre slaughter. And when Matelisen would have set it on fire, being now empty, unless by chance some had hidden them∣selves
therein; a certain Captain desired the custody there∣of, but he would not grant it, remembring Nrones late escape; nor indeed could he, for the rope breaking with which it was held, the ship returned to its companions. In the interim, the whole Portugal Fleet, that they might save the Nicholas in so great danger, weighing their Anchors, came out to Sea. The Hollanders sometimes waited for them one to one, otherwhiles two to one; however at last, one of the Spanish Vessels was burned, another carrying Sebastian Snares, yielded it self, the rest all torn and bloudy, hovered up and down, when night intercepted the Victory. Famous and full of Honour was the Hollanders Valour and Fortune that day, many of the Enemies being slain, and of them∣selves scarce any, except such as through greediness of boo∣ty, drew upon them ruine by commixing with the burning Ship. The next morning, one ship, which was very much shat∣tered, appeared, having only left a few  Slaves that towed it, which also was delivered, the rest returned to the Harbour. Matlisen desiring to spoil those likewise, that he might perfect so famous a Work, was retarded by fear, lest being so near the shore, he might run a ground, and so do himself a mischief. When this had remained under Consul∣tation some dayes; behold he sees the remainder of the Ships fired by the Portugueses themselves, with pleasure be∣holding the sad spectacle of a mad fear. The Prisoners which he had, he sent back to Alphonso de Castro, the Chief∣tains appointed the Ransome to be divided among the Sea∣men, and the rest upon this Condition, That the few Hollan∣ders detained at Malacca or elsewhere, should be restored in their stead. And he either esteemed the Enemies so vile, or his own men so pretious, that he exchanged but ten for almost two hundred. All the ships which he took from the Enemy, were burned, that they might not be chargeable, or troublesome to him, onely preserving the four and
twenty Great Gunnes which he won in the Fight. Thus as matters here went successfully on, so from the Molucca's contrary things were related; for after Verhagen hd left idoris to the antient Possessor, certain Portugueses falling upon the Philippines (which are a part of the domini∣on belonging to the Kingdome of Castile, which the Natives call Lusonia) desire and obtain aid of Petro Acuna the Go∣vernour, but with this Proviso, That for the future, the Mo∣lucaes should be open to the Castilians, (concerning which the said people had been long at difference, as we have elswhere related): Whereupon it was not rashly believed, That the Cactilians had rather the Islands should be recovered, then kept in such a necessity of time. Being come to Tidoris with seven and thirty Vessels great and small, that it might be possessed with the more ease, the King himself assisted, following the Hollanders Affairs outwardly with his words, but maligning them in his heart. Thence they passed to Ternata, there the Forts are taken, and the King who had been most faithful to the Hollanders, and foreseeing the dan∣ger, had often advised, that they should not leave Tidoris without a Fort, now suffering for anothers fault, first fled, then giving credit to the Spaniard, Articled for his life, and was commanded to hope for the rest; but his Kingdomes were disposed to such as were of old emulous to him, by the consent of the Spaniard, and himself kept in custody, and carryed into the Philippines. Matelisn, when he heard that Ternata was taken, fearing the like evil at Amboyna, and having by chance gon a small Ship of the Enemies, he furnished it with Arms, and there∣withal sends some that he had in the Fleet, that were men skilfull in the Art of Fortification. Himself went to a small Island called Buton, seeking the rest of the Portugal Fleet, which as before we related, going from Malacca, then lay there. But the Portugueses upon sight of the Enemy, being afraid
to fight, fastned the ships together, and all to the shore, bring∣ing all the Guns to one side, and choosing moreover a Creek of the Sea, where they might force the Enemy to Fight against Wind and Tyde; and hereto they added all along, great Piles of Wood and Sand. Matelisen seeing no possi∣bility of approach, endeavoured with some Fire-ships, to se the Fleet on fire; but they, partly by Boats, endeavoured to divert the mischief intended towards them, and the Wind also helped in blowing them back; but the season of the year did not suffer the Hollanders any longer to stay, being commanded rather to surcease from War, then Merchandise, appointing those that should carry them to the Moluccas, the Winds beginning to grow boysterous. Part of them went to Queda, the King of which place, to gain the favour of the Conqueror, imprisoned all the Portugueses living among them: On the other side, the Hollanders gave him all the Indians and Enemies he had in his power. And Other King∣domes also comming in and submitting, manifestly declared, That the Barbarians Faith would be shaken by the event of one Battel: So that some had Treated to buy their Peace of the Spaniards, by delivering up all the Hollanders Factors; but anon after some Merchants ships belonging to Portugal, be∣came their prey. Making hast from thence to Amboyna, where the People are great Lovers of the Hollanders, he built a Ca∣stle with great expedition and diligence; and Matelisen, though he believed there were two principal bonds, whereby Forreign Nations are united one to another, to wit, Marri∣age, and eligion, yet had with him no Ministers to reach sa∣cred matters, the society among the Hollanders, herein, not sufficiently imitating the Spaniards Prudence, who have the Jesuits as principal Instruments in the ordering Spiritual Af∣fairs in their Kingdoms; yet the Hollanders obtaining a gar∣rison there, intermarried with the Native Women, whereby Families being produced, it might the more easily become the beginning of a Colony.
The Shallowes would not suffer them to Land at Tidoris, neither indeed would it have been of any benefit, or value to have been invaded, which of necessity, must be left naked to the Enemy, by reason of its poverty: therefore they thought it more convenient, to Land in the North Corner of Ternata, where is a Village called Malaja, and great store of Provi∣sions, and to fortifie it with a Fort and Bulwarks: the Spa∣niards having strongly Fortified a Town on the South side, wherein he kept 400 Souldiers: And the matters proceeded with success; and when the greatness of the Work was grown such as they might hope to defend it, Matelisen de∣parting, appointed 45 men to the keeping of the place, giving them four Ships, that might carry them up and down the adjacent Sea; and thus a League was made with the Ru∣lers of Ternata, as had formerly been done with them of Ba∣rida: this being added, by reason of the imminent danger that they should at the present receive assistance; and that the Hollanders should not make a Peace or Truce with the Spaniards, but such wherein they should be included. Then he Commanded some of the People of the Isle of Macian (formerly subject to Ternata, but now Governed by Tidoris) hastning to Rebellion, that against the coming of the next Fleet, they should consider of wise Counsel, and lay aside rash and immature thoughts. Thence himself, with three Ships, and one small Bark went to China, long waiting for an uninterrupted Commerce; but after he had been to no purpose held in hand a great while, at last he per∣ceived the Portugueses coming from Machao, with six great Ships, and divers less to assayl him; It seemed to him, a rash thing, to hazard his Fame and Forces in the sight of an un∣known Nation with such unequal Forces: besides, his Ships were foul and heavy with durt, as is usual in long Voyages, and therefore, being frustrated of his great hopes, returning the same way he came, he understood that the Spaniard was
valiantly repulsed in Ternata, from his assault of the new Fortifications: But that the King of Jora, upon approach of the Enemies Forces from Malacca, voluntarily fired the Town, and fled into the Deserts and places unpassable: however, he sent Recruits to Ternata, for by chance, a fresh Ship was arrived from Holland: And the King of Jora being admonished by Letters of his fault, that he had not followed the Fortifying of the Town, although often called upon to that purpose, at last, this comfort was added, that they were coming that would revenge his injuries. At Java, Paul Cardenus met him with seven Ships, for he had lost one that struck upon a shelf at the Siege of Mo∣sambike, from which he was forced to depart by the sickness of his men, yet he took one of the Enemies Carracks, and spoiled two there, and others upon the Coast of Bengala: With Matelison, there came Embassadors from the King of Siam, who brought Gifts to the Prince; other Letters also were at the same time brought from divers Kings. He brought back with him two Ships, and three others followed, all loaden with Spices. At this same time, when the Indian Company was assisted not only with mony as home, but with forreign Treasure, even from the Enemy himself, a Noble Merchant being ac∣cused for the same, and thrown into Prison, whereupon, many others were necessitated to flight. As of old, France greatly flourished under a Potent King, so now it did the like under a Prince that was the Umpire of Peace in the World, whose Queen at this time, brought him a third Son: from this Kingdom, one Mounsieur de Mounte, as is elsewhere mentioned, had planted a Colony in the North part of America, near the River Canada, but without any benefit from thence besides Bever Skins, (and the Hol∣landers also had a share therein) but the Company being weary of the charge, it quickly fell to nothing: nevertheless, collecting others, Ships were again sent to repossess those
deserted places, who planted at Port-Royall and Quebeco, knowing e Ayr in the Island of Santa Cruce, was unwhol∣some. Into England, news was brought from Virginia, that no∣thing hindered their Landing, or planting, and that there was sufficient of all things for humane sustenance, but the nine which they had searched, were of no value. The faction of Tyrone troubled Ireland, making irruptions upon some strong Holds near the Sea, while Tyrone himself lived at Rome with the Pope, but no Supplies coming to them, the same Rebels were easily Conquered, and driven into the fastnesses of the Woods and Mountains. Spain, after the Sea was opened to it, and beginning to perceive the Commodities of Peace, yet sending of thirteen to the Indies, did not omit, besides Merchandise, to put Soul∣diers therein, as knowing, that if a League were made, yet whatever was taken before, would be esteemed lawful prize, and the King himself sweetning the hardships he had put upon his Creditors, renewed his Repute: Besides, by a rare Example, he caused his Subject to swear Allegiance to his Son, being yet an Infant of three years old, as Heir of his Kingdoms. Barbary, being always unquiet, while their Sooth-sayers, at pleasure, draw the Peoples minds changable by Supersti∣tion, now this way, now that way, and then disturbed by Abdala and his Uncle Zidan, the youngest Son of their some∣time King Hamet, by his lawful Wife, as he reported, of whom He possessing Fez in his Fathers name, yet soon lost Morocco, a most Noble City, Mahomet the Nephew of Ha∣met, being by the Citizens called to the Kingdom, who re∣ceived the same: Here by the uncertain Law of Africa, and for the more easie Retreat of Warriers, a formidable strength of Pirates planted themselves, disturbing the Sea near the Streights. The Rumour whereof came to the Hollanders, at what time Spinola was at the Hague; Therefore the States,
hearing the said Pirates had taken one Holland Ship, lest they should seem by dissimulation, to incourage a publick evill, shewed themselves ready with an Armed Fleet, severely to revenge themselves, if Spinola would promise they should not be molested by the Spaniards, but he protested he had no power to do any such thing. Among these Pirates, were many English, to whom hap∣pened an accident worthy of memory, which was, That some English under the shew of Merchants, entring a Ship of Zeland, on a sudden got the Marriners all under Decks, by chance, one Turk was therein, which was of the number of Prisoners, who be∣ing taken at Scluys; and having his liberty given him, notwith∣standing ever after lived in Zeland: He, daring to attempt any thing, being not of a servile nature, killed two Englishmen, as they were upon the Watch in the night, and overcharged with drink, then loosing the Mariners, hoysting their Sails, they returned into their Country, and delivered up the surviving Thieves to a just punishment. In Germany, a Dyet was called at Ratisbom, where no∣thing was done, though much deliberated upon: But the Emperour, who of late had begun to shew his care for the Affairs of Holland, was now himself deprived of his Domi∣nions: for Matthias choosing rather to have, then to expect Authority, and despising Rodolfus his sloth, found not a few in Hungary and Austria, who were troubled at the present state of Affairs, and having procured the Agreement of both those Nations, and causing the Germans to be hated, who under the pretence of Caesars Person, ruled all, Col∣lecting an Army, he leads it to Prague, where was his Bro∣thers Palace and Court; But the Bohemians standing up for Rodolfus, first a Treaty, and soon after a Peace was made, so as Matthias should for the present enjoy all the Christian part of Hungary, together with the Principalities of Austria and Moravia, and Bohemia for the future, if Rodolfus dyed without any Issue male: But Matthias had scarce gotten the
possession of his desires, but his Conditions were changed: Of affable becoming severe, and denying to the Austrian Protestants, the use of their Religion, whereupon their minds were turned from him, and their Arms against him: Nor did the Bohemians for the like causes, less disturb the Em∣perour. The Eighteenth and last Book of the History of the Dutch AFFAIRES. 1609.AT the beginning of the new year, the Zelanders being hardly brought by threats to give their consents, that their minds incensed with wrangling, might again grow into one, and all fear of protracting business be taken away, the Provinces promise among themselves: that they would make no agreement with the Enemy, unless the Liberty granted to them in those words, that the Deputies approved, were in deed and reality confirmed, and nothing contrary thereto should be admitted, whether sacred or pro∣fane. And if the Enemy should endeavour to do otherwise, they would wait eight dayes, and then absolutely break off the Treaty, and return to Arms, with all the strength they could possible make. And now on the one hand, the Embassadors of the Kings, and on the other, they that were sent from the King of Spain and Albertus, and were lately returned home, laboured to lessen the controverted points: but when that way seemed too slow, and it was found difficult to explicate business be∣tween absent people, it was concluded there was a necessity
of a further Treaty; and to that purpose, Antwerp was ap∣pointed as the fittest place, because many of the Hollanders were displeased with the Enemies residence among them, and they who before came as it were to desire peace, now looked upon their coming to them, as if they had come to sue: And for speeding on the Treaty, this way was invented, that as soon as Spinola, and they that had been with him at the Hague, were come to Antwerp, the Embassadors of the Kings should go thither, and carry with them a draught con∣taining the principal Heads of the League, to which the States, at the Request of the said Embassadors, a few things onely being altered, had consented: And when the Spaniards had subscribed to the same, then at last, the States Deputies should be sent to Antwerp for perfecting the rest, and the States themselves would be resident at Berghen op Zoom, that if any difficulty arose, they might be near at hand to be advi∣sed with thereupon. The Spaniards being shewed the said draught, and desired to Sign it, when they said, that was a little two imperious, because they were not the demands of Enemies, but of Friends, who were admitted Arbitors, and thereupon, at least demanded time of deliberation; they brought to passe, that upon the undertaking of the Embassadors of the Kings, the Cessation of Arms should be continued until the end of Fe∣bruary, they promising in the mean time to return their Answer. When they began to read over, and discuss the several Heads, they found nothing innovated in the words, asserting their liberty, only the Spaniards not induring that the Em∣bassadors should call the States by the Title of High and Mighty, consented at last; they should be written Illustri∣ous: The States desired, that those Tributes, which the Country Scituate in the middle between both Parties, had payd during the War, for redemption of their Lands from the spoil of the Souldiers, should be continued by the Truce;
But that was rejected, as Hostile and unjust; for most part of Holland was inclosed with Sluces and Rivers and paid no Tribute to the Enemy at any time; whereas they had great and wide Incursions into Brabant and Flanders. The Spa∣niards desired to take off all Customs which had been, by oc∣casion of the War, laid upon all ships passing the Scheldt, and other Rivers; saying also, That those were the Reliques of War, and not onely grievous to them, but to the French and English also. But they could not obain, that any thing thereof should be altered; the Embassadors well knowing, that Ze∣land abominated nothing more: Yet some hope was given, That after the League, the Matter might be brought to a bet∣ter pass, by Friendly Treaties of the Merchants among them∣selves; for the Spaniards had boasted, That it was in their Power, to make their Customs prove prejudicial to them that ex∣acted the same. Concerning the Indies, there was a long and sharp Dis∣pute, the States averring, there ought to be particular mention made thereof: But Richardot said, That King Philip's Inte∣rest would not suffer it to be done, for many Causes, which belonged not to the States to know; otherwise, by this Example, other Nati∣ons would require the same Liberty of Navigation, which neither the French nor English use, as granted to them, but at their own peril. Therefore, that the Truce might be made without any Exception, it was passed over; onely, He would have Com∣merce restrained within those places that King Philip pos∣sessed, either in Italy or Spain; denying, that any further In∣dulgence could be granted; and however he would not com∣mand the same, yet that would not hinder, but that the Hol∣landers might Traffique there; but it was not convenient, so to be declared by a publike League, for it would be enough, if it were setled by private Agreements.
The Embassadors answer'd, That therein were many things, to which the States would never be perswaded; for it was an Ho∣stile Act, to keep one out of the Limits of his Dominion, and therefore the Hollanders had rather, if they must want the fruits of Peace, contend for the Possession of that World by Arms. Be∣sides, there would be little safety in private Agreements, that should not be published to all Peoples Knowledge. But as to what was spoken of Spain and Italy, without doubt those Limitations were too narrow, since the Spaniard hath excluded none from the Islands, lying within the Streights of Gibraltar, or the Fortunate Islands▪ or the whole Coast of Barbary. The Spaniards Replyed, That during the War, the Hollanders never sailed to those remote places pos∣sessed by Philip, and now when they have by the Treaty of Peace acquitted the same, more ought not to be asked by a Truce, than either had been won by Arms, or could be ho∣ped for by Peace: King Philip would not allow the Indian Trade should be left to a War, and their case is far different from those of France and Brittain; for, from thence, there went out onely a few Ships, and those by stealth; but the Hollanders go thither with great Fleets. As to the rest, they seem'd to grant the same, that instead of Spain and Italy, all Europe should be named; and if private Covenants would not be satisfactory, they desired the publike League should be made, so as that the Word Indies should not be therein. After the form of this Article had been often amended, and what was approv'd by the one side, was disliked by the other; and that the Arch-Dukes had been consulted with first by Verreik, and afterwards by Richardot; at length, it was agreed in these words, That the Subjects of King Philip, the Arch-Dukes, and the States, during the Truce, should maintain Amity, forgetting and forgiving the Injuries given or received in the War:
That it be lawful for them to pass backward and forward, and freely to Trade by Land, Sea, and Rivers, which the King thinks fit to limit within Europe, and such other places, as have heretofore, by his permission, been open to his Friends, and those at Peace with him; but without those Bounds, it shall not be lawful to negotiate and trade, in any the Coun∣tries, Towns, and Ports, by him possessed, without private leave first had and obtain'd: But neither King Philip, his Ministers, or Subjects, shall hinder them then from Trading there with any other Kings or People willing to deal with them; nor shall the Hollanders, or any that admit the Hol∣landers to Commerce, be molested in his Name. To which words, the Embassadors of the Kings would have these added, viz. When in time it shall be necessary, that they who are conversant beyond those Bounds with Ships and Forces, understand that there is a League made, from thence forward a Truce shall begin there for one Year; and if a Messenger arrive there before, both Parties to forbear Hostility; and, if after the Year, any Hostile Acts be done, the damage shall be made good. The Spaniards hearkned to this with great Reluctancy, as well because by manifest Tokens the Indies were expressed, no less than if they had bin named; as for that they desired Things taken and seized in that part of the World, if they could be found, should be restored, but slaughters and deva∣stations by fire could not be restored: They being more prone to Cruelty, but the Hollander esteeming Booty at a higher value than Bloud: However, at last they yielded, but their Countenances and Words manifesting they had recei∣ved an Injury. The Embassadors having thus far brought the Business to perfection, after they had received the Directions of the Kings their Masters, by swift and speedy Messengers, being required by the States to come to Berghen, they declare to
them all they had done: Beseeching them, That they would be content with those Agreements exceeding all their hopes, and that they should not too solicitously scan the Words, for the Kings were pleased therewith: And that nothing might be wanting to their Security, voluntarily promised, That if the Spaniard by force disturbed the Indian Commerce, they would take Re∣venge thereof, as if the Truce had been violated. Whereupon the States, after a little Consultation among themselves, send their Deputies to Antwerp, the same which had been nomi∣nated before for making Peace; onely Nicholas Berk was substituted in the place of Cornelius Renessen that had been for Ʋtrecht. To these it was given in charge that they perfect the Remainder; and where they could, should explain and make clear any thing that seem'd obscure. The Spaniards would be asked, that the Truce should continue for 12 years; And that a long Dispute might not arise, in discoursing particu∣lars concerning Bounds, it was agreed to be sufficient, That each should retain the Countries and Towns they possessed at present, and that the Country about should be reckon'd with the Town: As to Commerce, besides those Things al∣ready remembred, it was agreed, That neither should lay greater Impositions on the other, than their Friends or Citi∣zens bore when they paid least: And that the Crime of Dif∣ference in Religion, might not oppress Travellers or Mer∣chants passing up and down, the same Things were granted to the Hollanders, which Velasco had promised the English by private Agreement. That they shall not retain the ships of strangers for publike service, nor decide the Right of Seizure, otherwise than according to the prescript Rule of Law. Many Things were spoken of concerning private Affairs, and more fit to be setled by a Peace, than a Truce. And all Prisoners on both sides to be set at Liberty, Gratis. That the space of 42 years should not by Prescription endammage those that follow'd di∣vers Parties, nor any Sentences given against such as were ab∣sent,
and made no Defence; That there should be no Restitution of moveable Goods received Profits, or bestowed Honours; That all things should immediatly return to the antient Lords of the Soil, or to those Societies, which are devoted to Religion in the Arch-Dukes Jurisdictions, but without any Power to alienate the same: But for what had bin sold from the Exchequer, instead thereof, during the Truce, a Yearly Revenue should be paid; and for what had been bestow'd in publick Works, the value should be given; That it should be lawful to redeem any Farms seized for Debt, within a year; yet so, as a just account should be had to necessary Charges; but the like Priviledges was taken from Houses sci∣tuate in Towns, so as they should absolutely remain to the Pur∣chasers: For Lakes, Marishes, and overflowed Grounds, drained by private men at their own Charge, nothing was done, unless any Rent was raised out of the Land; That the Exchequer, and not the antient Professour, should account for the Rents formerly set upon the Land, for those years which they held the same Farms: And because it consisted with the Honour of the Common∣wealth nominally to include the House of Nassau, which had so well deserved of Liberty; and therefore it was concluded, That they should not receive their own, but besides, should not be liable to any Debt which his Father had contracted since the Duke of Alva's time; That the making of Testaments should be com∣manded to the Citizens and People under both Dominions, and no Writings or Deeds should be of any force, which had dis-inherited the next of Kin, out of Hatred to Sides or Parties: That, to the Cities, whose Jurisdiction, by the League should return to private persons, yet the States should appoint Magistrates in such as were in their Dominion, and the Arch-Dukes the like in their Territo∣ries: And with no less Prudence was it provided, That this Truce should be beneficial to those, who having gone out of the Netherlands for fear of the War, had sought Forein Habitati∣ons.
Most of these Heads were written by Olden-Barneveldt, as he fear'd any thing dangerous, or foresaw any thing advan∣tagious to his Country; so tempering his words, with won∣derful carefulness. And as Supports of Security, these Defences were raised: That no Ships of War should come from one another to the Ports, Havens, or Coasts of the other, unless by per∣mission, or forced by Tempest; That it should not be lawful to build any new Forts: And that common Assistance should be promised to drive away and punish Thieves both by Sea and Land; That private Trespasses should be vindicated upon the Authors thereof themselves, or else where they lived; yet, under that pretence, it should not be lawful to break the Truce: That this League should be confirm'd by King Philip, and the Arch-Dukes, in the Name of themselves, and their Heirs; and the States likewise for them∣selves to ratifie the same: The States and Arch-Dukes, within five days, and Philip the Third within a Moneth: And that each should promise to the other, that they would not do, or suffer to be done, any thing to the contrary, directly or indirectly; and whoever should dare to do the contrary, to be punish'd with all severity. And these were the publike Acts. In private, the Spaniards by connivence of the French, ob∣tain'd what they so earnestly desir'd, to wit. That, that part of Brabant subject to the States, and which hitherto had used the Latine Rites, should still enjoy the same without any alteration. But the States Deputies receiv'd from the Embassadors of the Kings, a Testimonial in Writing, That the Adversaries had often, during the Treaty, protested, that the Indies were comprehended under the General Head concerning Commerce; And that the States, at Request of the said Embassadors, promising thus much, had granted, that they should not be named. Besides, that was the Mind of the States, that all things used by the Spani∣ards
in the Indies against them, the same they do towards the Spaniards; And if any Hollanders there should be opposed, or assailed, it should not be a breach of the Truce to defend them; That the Jurisdictions of Breda and Berghen, should be contained within the Bounds, and whatever was about, or belonged to the Grave. On the other side, at the Request of the French Em∣bassador, the States Deputies did testifie, That the Heirs of the Prince of Spinoy, who had formerly taken the part of the States, were to be reckon'd among those that were to have their Goods re∣stored; And if the Prince of Ligny delay'd to make Restitution, that the States should adjudge the possession of Wassenaer, be∣longing to the Princes of Ligny in Holland, to the Princes of Spi∣noy. And this was given in Favour of the Duke of Roan, at that time very powerful in France, as having the chief Com∣mand of the Treasury and Exchequer; And his Daughter mas marryed into the House of Spinoy. The Ninth Day of April the League was made, whereby those Arms, famous through Europe, and now carryed into another World, were laid aside by a Truce, in hope of a fu∣ture Peace. And immediatly it was approved by the Arch-Dukes, and States Letters, and publikely proclaim'd at Ant∣werp, and in all those Parts, to the high content, and with the exceeding Joy of all the Common People. But it was not so well resented among the Hollanders; who, though People of their own Nature, loving Peace, yet having been disorder'd by the prosperity and misery of fourty years, yet could not suddainly return to their first Nature. But Foreiners, when the Report thereof came to their Ears, they wonder'd, that such a Confession of Liberty, and share in the Indies, could be ex∣torted from so puissant a King, being a Thing so far without
Example, that it was even beyond Credit. From hence reck∣oning the value of strength and Counsels; And certainly, from this time, many Kings, Princes, and Nations, began  respect the Society and Alliance of Holland. FINIS.
