ANNO XV. CAROLI REGIS. CHAP. I. An Act to admit the Subject to plead the General Issue in Informations of Intru∣sion brought on the behalf of the Kings Majestie, and to retain his possession till Tryal. WHere the Kings Majestie out of his Prerogative Royal, may enforce the Subject in Informations of Intrusion brought against him to a special pleading of his title, the Kings most Excellent Majestie out of his Gracious Disposition to∣wards his loving Subjects, and at their humble suit being willing to remit a part of his ancient and Regal power, is well pleased that it be Enacted, And be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majestie, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That whensoever the King, his Heirs or Successors and such from or under whom the King claimeth, and all others claiming under the same ti∣tle, under which the King claimeth, hath been or shall be out of possession by the space of twenty years, or hath not, or shall not have taken the profits of any Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, within the space of twenty years before any Information of Intrusion brought, or to be brought to recover the same: that in every such case, the Defendant or the Defendants may plead the General Issue, if he or they so think fit, and shall not be pressed to plea specially, and that in such cases the Defendant or Defendants shall retan the possession he or they had at the time of such Information exhibited, util the title be tryed, found, or Adjudged for the King. And be it further Eact∣ed, That where an Information of Intrusion may fitly and aptly be brought on the Kings behalf, that no Scire facias shall be brought, whereunto the Subject shall be forced to a special pleading, and be deprived of the Grace in∣tended by this Act. CHAP. II. An Act for Abridging of Proclamations upon Fines, to be leavied at the Com∣mon Law. WHereas a Statute made within the Kingdom of England, in the fourth year of King Henry the Seventh, hath Ordained that every Fine to be leavied with Proclamations in the Kings Court, before his Iu∣stices of the Common Pleas, should be proclaimed in the same Court that
term in which it is ingrossed, and in three terms then next following, at four several days in every term, by reason whereof they ought to be proclai∣med four times in every of the four several Terms, and that during the time of proclaiming of such Fines, all Pleas should cease, which to do according to the said Statute, considering the number of Fines which are like hereafter to be levied, would require several days in every Term, and be some preju∣dice and interruption to the Causes and Suits, in the said Court of Com∣mon Pleas within this Kingdom, and also give occasions of sundry errors through the negligence and misprisions of Clerks, in mis-entring the same, and otherwise, whereby the Fines may be reversed: Be it therefore Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majestie, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by Authority of the same, that all Fines with Proclamations from and after the Feast of Easter next ensuing, to be levied in the said Court, shall be proclaimed only four times, that is to say, once in the Term wherein it is Ingrossed, and once in every of the three Terms, holden next after the same Ingrossing, and that every Fine proclaimed (as aforesaid) shall be of as great force and effect in Law, to all intents and purposes, as if the same had been sixteen times proclaimed, according to the Statutes heretofore made. CHAP. III. An Act for the relief of Patentees, Tenants and Farmers of Crown lands or other profits, or of Lands within the Survey of the Court of Wards and Li∣veries, in cases of forfeiture for not payment of their Rents, or other service or duty. FOrasmuch as the Kings Majestie out of his gracious disposition, is and ever hath been averse from taking any advantage, howsoever lawful and just, against any of his Subjects, growing by any forfeiture, breach of Condition, or strict interpretation of his Highness Grants, or Letters Pa∣tents, or the Grants or Letters Patents of any of his Royal Predecessors, of any Mannors, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, and yet the Gran∣tees or Patentees, deriving their Estates by or from his Majestie or his Predecessors, have been too apt and ready to exact the advantage of such for∣feiture, where his Majestie himself or his Predecessors have not required the ame, which hath been ever held an unequal and extream course, and hath any times been relieved by Suits in Courts of Equity, though with the grat charge and trouble of the parties indangered thereby: For remedy whreof, aswell where the King or any of his Predecessors or Successors, have granted or shall grant the said Mannors, Lands, Tenements or Heredi∣taments, or any part thereof, or the Reversion or any part thereof to any other, as where the Reversion, Remainder, or Estate thereof, is or shall be in the Kings Majestie or his Successors, in the right of the Crown of Ireland, or otherwise, his Majestie of his abundant grace towards his loving Sub∣jects, is gratiously pleased that it be Enacted, and be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majestie, by and with the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that if any person or persons, Bodies Politick or Corporate, having, holding, or possessing, or which hereafter shall have, hold, or possess any Mannors, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, by virtue or colour of any original Grant or Lease or Assignment of the same, made by the Kings Majestie or any of his Predecessors, or to be made by his said Majestie or any of his Successors, for any number of years, for Life or
Lives, in Fee tail or Fee simple, or other Estate whereupon any Rent, Ser∣vice, or other duty hath been, is or shall be reserved or payable, with or un∣der any Condition or Limitation, of Reentry Ceer, or to be void for default of payment of such Rent, or performance of such Service or Duty, heretofore hath made, or any other by, from or under whom he claimeth, hath made, or any which hereafter shall have, hold or possess, shall make any default therein, and yet after such default made, such Rent, Service or other duty hath been or shall be answered, paid or done unto his Majestie or any of his Predecessors or Successors, into his or their Receipt of the Exchequer or Court of Wards, or to any other having Authority to receive the same, as the case shall require, before any advantage of such forfeiture, or cause of for∣feiture hath been or shall be taken, and before any Commission awarded to enquire, or other process issued touching the said forfeiture or non-payment of Rent, that in all such cases no advantage shall be taken by his Majestie, his Heirs or Successors, of, for or by reason of any such forfeiture or cause of forfeiture. And be it further Enacted, That no person or persons claiming, or which afterwards shall claim, by, from or under his Majestie, or any of his Predecessors or Successors, at any time after such cause or title of forfeiture given, shall in any wise have or take any benefit or advantage, by reason, means or colour of such default made or to be made, but that every such E∣state forfeited or forfeitable, by means or occasion, of such default of payment of Rent or Performance of service, or other duty shall be adjudged to conti∣nue and have his being, as if no such default or cause of forfeiture had been had, or made, any Law, Custome, or Vsage, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

CHAP. VII. An Act concerning Clergy. FOrasmuch as heretofore some doubt hath been conceived whether the al∣lowance of Clergy in case of Fellony do in Law acquit the Fellon of all other Fellonies by him formerly committed, for the clearing of which doubt; Be it Enacted and declared by the Kings most Excellent Majesty with the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this pre∣sent Parliament Assembled, and by Authority of the same, that all and
every person and persons which shall hereafter be admitted to have the be∣nefit of his or their Clergy shall notwithstanding his or their admission to the same be put to answer to all other Fellonies whereof he or they shall be hereafter indicted or appealed, and not being thereof before lawfully acquit∣ted, convicted, attainted, or pardoned, and shall in such manner and form be arraigned, tryed, judged and suffer such Execution for the same, as he or they should have done, if as Clerk or Clerks convict, they had been delivered to the Ordinary, and there had made his or their purgation. CHAP. VIII. An Act for punishing of Offenders within the County of Dublin, and County of the City of Dublin against the Act for Keepers of Alehouses to be bound by Recognizance. WHereas in the late Parliament held in this Kingdom in the tenth year of his Majesties Reign that now is, there was a good and pro∣fitable Law made, intituled, An Act for Keepers of Alehouses to be bound by Recognizance: Which Law hath not wrought that good effect within the County of the City of Dublin, and County of Dublin, that was expected, for that the said Statute directeth that every person or persons offending a∣gainst the same should be proceeded against and punished either before the Lord Deputy or other chief Governor or Governors, and the Council of State for the time being, or in his Majesties Court of Exchequer or before the Iustices of Assize at their general assizes, and for that few or none of the Offenders against the Statute have been prosecuted before the Lord Deputy and Coun∣cil, or in his Majesties Court of Exchequer, for that the proceedings in the said Courts are not of so ready dispatch as the presentments befoe the Iustices of Assize, and for that there are no Iustices of Assize which do ride within the County of Dublin, or within the County of the City of Dublin, Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament, that all and every person and persons dwelling within the County of Dublin or the County of the City of Dublin, offending contrary to the form of the said Statute, shall be proceeded against and punished either before the Lord De∣puty or other chief Governour or Governours, and Council of State there for the time being, or in his Majesties Court of Exchequer, or before the Iudges of his Majesties Court of Kings Bench or chief place, or before his Majesties Iustices of the peace at the Quarter Sessions, of the said several Counties, who shall have full power and Authority to hear and determine the same, And to the intent the said Law may the better be put in Executi∣on, It is further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid that the Informer which shall cause such presentments, and Informations to be made and prosecuted with effect, shall have the third part of such Fine, as shall be imposed upon such as shall offend, contrary to the purport of the said Statute. CHAP. IX. An Act to discharge and free true Men from all forfeitures for Killing such as attempt to Rob or Murther them. FOrasmuch as it hath been questionable that if any evil disposed person or persons, do attempt felloniously to rob or murther, any person or persons in or near any Common highway, Cartway, Horsway, or Footway, or in their Mansions, Messuages, or dwelling places or grounds, or that felloniously do attempt to break any dwelling Houses, in the night or day time should hap∣pen
in his or their being in such their fellonious intent and attempt to be slain by him or them whom the said evil doerrs should so attempt to rob, or murther: or by any person or persons being with them in their said dwelling Houses, which the same evil doers should attempt Burgularly, or felloni∣ously to break by night, or by day, whether the said person happening in such Case to slay any such person so attempting to commit such murther, Rob∣bery, or Burglary, should for the death of such evil disposed person forfeit or loose his goods and Chattels for the same, as any other person should do that by chance medly should happen to kill or slay any other person or in his or their defence, for the declaration of which ambiguity and doubt. Be it Enacted by our Sovereign Lord the King, with the assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament As∣sembled, and by the Authority of the same, that if any person or persons at any time hereafter be Indicted or appealed of or for the death of any such evil disposed person or persons attempting to murther or rob as aforesaid or Burgulariously or felloniously to break any Mansion Houses as is above∣said that the person or persons so indicted or appealed thereof, and of the same by verdict so found and tryed shall not forfeit or loose any Lands, Te∣nements, Goods, or Chattels, for the death of any such evil disposed per∣son in such manner slain; but shall be thereof, and for the same fully acquit∣ted and discharged in like manner as if the same person or persons, shoul be if he or they were lawfully acquitted of the death of the said evil disposed person or persons. CHAP. X. An Act for remedy of errors and defects in Fines and Common Recoveries heretofore leavied acknowledged and suffered. FOrasmuch as Fines and Common Recoveries are the best and highest assurances which the Law hath provided for securing of mens Estates, in Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, and that partly by reason of the Common Calamity of Wars which for many years disturbed the peace and prosperity of this Kingdom, and partly by reason of the negligences and misprisions of Clerks and Officers in writing engrossing, and prosecuting of such Fines and Recoveries, and the careless keeping of the Records thereof many errors and defects have passed and overslipt therein to the great dan∣ger of the shaking and weakning of such assurances and Estates contrary to the true meaning of all parties thereunto, for reformation whereof; Be it Enacted by our Sovereign Lord the Kings most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parlia∣ment assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that no Fine Proclama∣tions upon fines or common Recovery had, leavied, suffered, or passed before the first day of Easter Term, in the first year of the Reign of the Kings most Excellent Majesty that now is, where the possession of the Lands, and Hereditaments, therein mentioned hath been enjoyed according to the said Fine or Recovery, or the Indentures or other writings declared the uses thereof, shall be reversed by any writ of error but shall be deemed and adjudg∣ed good and effectual in Law, as if the same had been duely and legally ac∣knowledged had leavied, suffered and passed, in all and every the parts there∣of; any error or defect in matter of Fact or Law whatsoever, or any Law, Statute, Ordinance, or Provision whatsoever to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding: provided always that this Act or any thing therein contained shall not extend unto any Fine or Fines, Proclamati∣ons upon Fine or Fines or common Recovery or Recoveries, whereof
any writ or writs of error, is or are already brought before the first day of February last and now depending in his Majesties Court of chief place here, or Kings Bench in England, for reversing or making void of any fines or common Recoveries; Provided further that if any person or persons which are or shall be intituled unto any writ or writs of error, for the reversal of any such Fine or Fines recovery or recoveries be or were within the Age of one and twenty years Feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned or beyond the Seas, the said first day of Easter Term in the said first year of his now Majesties Reign or at any time sithence, that then such person or persons shall be at liberty to bring their writ or writs of error so as they bring the same within three years after the end of this Session of Par∣liament or within five years next after he or they shall attain their full Age, discovertures coming of sound mind, inlargement out of prison, or coming into this realm. CHAP. XI. An Act for Endowing of Churches with Gleab Lands. WHereas all Beneficiaries with Cure especially Viccars are bound to perpetual residence and yet through the War and confusion of former times in this Kingdom the Ancient Gleabs in many places are so obscured that they cannot be found out: by which means the incumbents are necessita∣ted to perpetual non residence, Be it therefore Enacted by the King most Ex∣cellent Majesty the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this Parliament Assembled, and by Authority of the same, that it shall be law∣ful for any devout person without licence of Mortmain to endow Churches having no Gleabs, or not above ten Acres of Gleab with new Gleab, provi∣ded that the Gleab of any one Church so endowed do not exceed forty Acres at the most and that the said Lands be not holden in capite, or by Knights service. CHAP. XII. An Act concerning twentieth parts and other sums of mony payable by persons Ecclesiastical. WHereas it was Enacted and ordeyned amongst other things in a Par∣liament holden at Dublin, in the eight and twentieth year of King Henry the eight that if any summ of mony being once due by any Incum∣bent of any dignity, benefice or promotion Spiritual in the name of a twen∣tieth part, being lawfully demanded, were not truly contented, and paid to such person or persons as should have the charge of the Collection thereof or their Officers and Ministers at the time of the demand, or within forty days after, that then every such Incumbent after such default certified into the Kings Exchequer in writing, under the Seals of such person or persons as are charged by the said Act with the collection of the said Annuall pension, should be adjudged deprived (ipso facto) of all such dignities, benefices and promotions Spiritual as he should have at the time of such certificate to be made or at any time after, so that all such dignities, benefices or pro∣motions should be clearly void of Incumbents in the law to all intents and purposes as if the said Incumbent were indeed dead, which Act be∣ing fitted and accomodated to the state of those times to take away the for∣reign dependance of the Clergy, is become a means often to deprive Pa∣trons
of their right of presentation, without any default of theirs, the Or∣dinary not being bound to give notice to the Patron, in case of any such o∣mission, & for that a meer omission in the Incumbent deserveth not to be so rigorously punished, Be it Enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty with the Assent of the Lords Spiritual & Temporal and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, that the omission or not payment of the said twentieth parts, Annual Rent, pension, or sum of money after the last day of this present Session shall be no deprivation nor cause of forfeiture or deprivation of any such Incumbent, But that every such Incumbent so failing in the payment of the said An∣nual Rent or pension shall forfeit to his Majesty for his omission as (nomine poenae) the triple value of such twentieth part, Annuall Rent, pension or sum of money as he ought by virtue of the said former Act to have paid and failed in the payment thereof, the said former Act or any thing therein con∣teyned to the contrary notwithstanding.
