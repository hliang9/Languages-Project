Some Brief CONSIDERATIONS AND PROPOSALS, Relating to the DEPENDENCIES OF THE ENGLISH NATION WITH Spaine, &c. London, Printed Anno Dom. 1658/9.
Some brief Considerations and Proposals, re∣lating to the Dependencies of the English Nation with Spaine, &c. WHat the sufferings of this Nation were, in the breach with Spaine, in the yeare 1655. most men are sensible of, more particularly the Mer∣chants that traded thither, which had great e∣states seized on, and ever since have the Pirates of Dunkirk, Ostend, Sansebastians passage, Calicia, and others in the Straights, had their ends in taking (even at their pleasure) our ships trading for any part of Europe, and elsewhere, to the lessening the stock of the Naion, weakning its strength, and ruining of many a family, that lived in great plenty and reputation, supporting many others, it being clearly to be demonstrated, that since the first falling out with that Nation, this hath lost, when least, 700. saile of ships small and great, most of which might have been preserved, if the managers of the Navie appertaining to this State, had been pleased to have em∣ployed so many of its men of Warre for checking of those Pirates, as would have been well maintained by the purchase they might have taken from the enemy, and the revenue that must have come into this Common wealth for Custome and Excise of our lost goods, ('tis true, great Fleets were sent abroad to as great charge of the Nation, but they lay together in such stations, where few or none of the enemies private men of War did frequent, whereas had they been reparted in the Bay of Biscay, Coast of Galicia, and within the Streights, (as well as before Cales,) as was desired by several Me∣morandums
and Applications of Merchants, most of our ships had been protected, and the enemies men of Warre either destroyed or disheartened from coming abroad, but they seeing no effectual course was in particular taken to suppresse them, encouraged by great boo∣ties obtained from us, knowing from their Agents here how things went, have encreased in strength and number, and unlesse some trading, or suffer the Commerce to be destroyed, to the enriching the Adversaries. Private men, we know, must not meddle with mysteries of State, where so judicious persons sit at the Helme of Government: yet as well-wishers to the whole, being made too sensible as to the thing in hand; we suppose it our duty modestly to present our thoughts concerning the affairs with Spain, as verst with the dispositions of that Nation. Known it is that a vast treasure hath been spent in carrying on the Warre with that people, which notwithstanding hath not wrought the intended effects, for their policie hath been such, (though in many things to their prejudice) as to judge it their great∣est safety to lie still, and not to set forth their Armada to engage with our Fleets, keeping themselves in part from those great expen∣ces which we have continually been at, affording the Dutch the con∣veniences to serve them in times of necessity, as in bringing their treasure from the Canary Islands, &c. which with themselves as our back-friends, use all meanes to weare out the purse of the Na∣tion, and occasion discontents for want of trade, thereby either to spoile us by a Warre, or reduce us to such termes of peace as would be as bad, and in the mean time the Spaniards take such opportu∣nities of getting home their West-India Fleets, when our ships can∣not well remain on their Coasts, or are wearied with waiting there for want of necessaries, as it hath formerly fll out. And whereas the Merchants and Navigation of England, have af∣ter the Warre undergone such great losses, many of the Spaniards on the contrary, have enjoyed greater advantages then in time of peace, occasioned by our continual and irrigular trading thither, em∣ploying the Native Spaniards & others as Factors, which put our com∣modities at what rates they please, and their own goods, as Wines, VVools, Fruit, &c. even as they list, insomuch that a Pipe of Ca∣nary VVine now, costs more then double the value of what former∣ly
it did, and our Goods that yielded a considerable advance there∣in times of peace, by the Accounts those Spaniards and our Corre∣spondents now give, the Product will scarce answer the principal Cost here in England; the like Negotiation is found in Malaga and other parts of Spain, to which must be added, that in this disadvan∣tageous trade, we employ for the most part Holland-ships and Sea∣men, enemies at heart of this Nation, to the Augmentation of their Shipping, Seamen and VVealth, the consequence whereof may in the end produce no good to England, and whats as bad as the rest, those Spanish Commodities, by our untimely and immoderate pressing for them, are not to be obtained by our English Manufactory, as in for∣mer times, but store of Plate is sent to purchase them, so that as sil∣ver was brought in abundance from Spain hither, obtained for our English Goods, now its carried thither for the buying of what is not at all in effect beneficial to this Nation. Then is to be noted that this Common-wealth had in most part of Spain considerable Factories, which did great subsinesse for them∣selves and friends, yea, the greater part of the Spaniards affairs did run by our hands: but now not an Englishman dares appear (ex∣cept some that this Nation is little beholding to for the service they do the enemy, and if any are discovered, they are immediately laid hold of, and imprisoned as Spies, &c. And any Goods appertain∣ing to English, and but slenderly proved to be such, are absolutely Confiscate; on the contrary, here in London, native Spaniards that never came in times of Peace, are as free as our selves, and bring in store of VVines and other Goods by the hands of Jewes and some others, which take them up in their own names, and the proceed of a great part of their effects, is and hath been remitted to Flanders, for several yeares past; so that if such Negotiations be not prevent∣ed, what will follow; but whereas we were the managers of the Commerce with Spain formerly, Jews and Spaniards with their Confederates will have all in their possession, and take many other conveniences out of our hands, which how well in time it will stand with this Nations interest and safety, may easily be dis∣cerned. And yet all these particulars premised, and though the damages sustained by warre have been so considerable, we are not well fitted to treat of a Peace, especially if the Spaniard see first an inclination here to
strike up with them, for then Articles cannot be made so honourable and profitable for us, as they might before this VVar began, and therefore an orderly Prosecution of the same a while longer, may bring matters into such a posture, as to answer our conveniences, and the worlds expectations, as to the Engagement with that Na∣tion. Wheefore are humbly offered as Expedients. First, that there may be an absolute Prohibition for the bringing in any Canary, Malaga, or Sherry Sacks, or Fruit, from either place, for the space of about two yeares, in which time the Owners of those Commodities which are chiefly spent in England, that now are grown very rich, by our ill managing the trade, will be reduced to much hardship, if not to a discontent with their Governours and the Kings duties, which are now considerable, will be brought ve∣ry low; and in this time, while we desist from the trade, will all our English Manufactory that is in Spain already, and going thither, be spent at good rates, which will put the better estimation upon the same for future, and other Nations will with many, and other bet∣ter effects, (then those we have now from Spaine,) take them off our hands, to supply the Markets when there's want, this being one of the best remedies, as the Case stands, to provide an advantageous trade for time to come, which otherwise cannot be driven, but at losse to us, and too great benefit of the Spaniards, either in Peace or VVar, and the rather because all Englishmen in the Spanish trade, are, and have been at liberty to adventure what they list, without the Restriction of a Company, as the Custome is for other parts of the VVorld, as Turky, East-India, &c. Secondly, the grand expectations of the King of Spain, and his Subjects, are the Arrival of his Plate Fleet, now supposed, after their Conjunction, at the Havana, from Cartagena and new Spaine, to be upon their way for Europe: in which comes the treasure of two or three yeares drawing together; and as it concernes him much to have the same, so it will this Nation to deprive him of it, and pos∣sesse it our selves; which if it should so fall out in this Juncture of time, would discompose that Kings affairs in most part of his Do∣minions, and how much it may further ours, may be judged, this State by Intelligence, which questionlesse it hath, knoweth best
what strength they consist of▪ and answerably what power to or∣der against them, and in what stations to atnd them, in that doubt∣lesse their bent will be either for Cales, Gibraltar, or the Groyne in Galicia; as for the Canaries, their last suffering there will make them shy of returning to that place; if three or foure small nimble sailing Frigats lay in different latitudes about the Western Islands, one or more probably may get sight of the Spaniard, and observe their mo∣tions, and as there is occasion give notice to our Fleets, as they shall be appointed, and the Nation being able to spare so many ships for this hopeful affaire, the charge extraordinary cannot be very great, to put them forth a little sooner then they might, upon other emploiments, lying already fitted, and this design taking effect might clear the Common-wealths obligations, and furnish it to carry on the warre to purpose, against those that otherwise will employ the same against us and our friends. In the Bay of Biscay, among others are the chief Ports of San∣sebastians passage and Bilbao: the Inlets of Commodities which fur∣nish that Countrey, and the North-parts of Castilia: especially with Fish, whereof those parts spend great quantities, and will be sup∣plied by the French and Dutch, with whatsoever they have occasion, except prevented by this State in keeping men of War upon that Coast, but eight ot ten Frigats will hinder their trade, and de∣prive the places aforesaid, from other conveniences of the inhabi∣tants, which will make them clamorous; More particularly, when they cannot sell their Countrey-goods, as Wooles, Iron, Steel, &c. nor receive Corne and other Provisions from sorreign parts, whereof for the most part they are in great want, and our Frigats will also check the attempts of the many Spanish men of Warre, sailing out of Pasage and Sansebastian, that have hitherto done the Nation so much mischief, and will still, if not lookt after. In the Provinces of Galicia and Asturia, seated between Biscay and Portugal, the King of Spain hath a very great Revenue out of Salt, that is brought into those parts from South-Spain, by Hollan∣ders and others, which they may be totally deprived of, as of ma∣ny other concernments, by keeping about ten men of Warre about those parts, where are convenient harbours to water and shelter in upon occasion: and the taking the said Salt will not be only the Kings losse, but the whole Countrey must be driven to great
extremities, and not be able to follow their Fishing trade, which is the greatest maintenance the common people have, and this Squadron will lie opportunely to secure our Merchants ships, tra∣ding for Portugal and other places, from Biscayners, Ostenders, and other Pirates, that saile out of the ports of Galicia. Malaga, Alicante, and Valensia, within the Streights of Gibraltar, are places abounding with Wine, Oyle, and Fruit, the greater part whereof is brought for England, and that trade failing, the people there will generally be driven to straits, the rather if we have Ships of Warre upon their Ports, to examine all strangers, and deprive them from carrying in Provisions, without which they cannot well subsist, and Commodities lying on the Inhabitants hands, (as they must, if strangers bring them not hither,) will be for the most part lost, and a Squadron kept about those Coasts, will secure most of our trade in the Levant, against all enemies. Sevilla, Cales, and Saint Lucar, which are the chief places of trade in Spain, do set forth all ships for the Indies, and thither for the most part return that Kings Fleets, and particular vessels, with silver and other Commodities, out of the said India; but about twelve Saile of our ships continually kept there, may impede the carrying in of any Provisions for the supply of the Countrey, or the Kings Fleets, which ordinarily are brought from Holland, France; and also intercept their ships going to, and coming from the Indies, and other places, hindring the excursions of private men of War, that saile thence to annoy our Merchants ships; and upon any occasion of service to this Nation, may soon be drawn the Squa∣drons from the Coast of Galicia, Biscaya, and the Streights, to joyne with these: which together will make a sufficient strength, to en∣counter any power Spain can set forth, or may expect from abroad. Such Courses as these being taken in good earnest, and none but diligent, affectionate, and able Commanders, employed in our Fleets, will not only preserve our Commerce, but be a great repute to the Nation, in a manner keeping the Coasts of all Spain conti∣nually alarm'd: depriving that King of the greater part of his in∣comes, and render his people incapable to pay taxes, which are heavy upon them; and consequently, his Armies and Garrisons will be neglected in Pay and Provisions, some of his remotest terri∣tories will revolt or be taken from him, and a general calamitie
overwhelm his dominions then, (and scarce otherwise) will that Nation be made truly sensible, what it is to have peace or war with England, and being brought low, he will as eagerly seek for a peace from us, (and with more reason) then he did lately from the Hollander; once his subjects granting in a manner their own conditions, at least for better then we had, by the last Articles of Peace. This being certain, that the King of Spain, seeing this Nation formidable, and valuing it selfe of its strength, will yield to our reasonable desires. But if now, or at other time a Peace should be treated of among other things, that may more immediatly concern the State; these heads may be insisted upon for the bettering of our Nation in ge∣neral, and encouragement of Merchants and Factors that shall con∣tinue trading with Spain. First, that Restoration be made to the several Merchants of this Nation, of the state and shipping which the King of Spain and his Ministers did seize on in the yeare 1655. which will amount to a very considerable summe, and be made out by testimony, and this he is absolutely bound to do, and our Governours engaged to see performed, beside many other Reasons that may be shewen more particularly, by the twenty third Article of the Treaty between the two Nations, made 1630. which in expresse words saith. Item, if it shall happen hereafter, which God forbid that any displeasure do arise betwixt the said Renowned Kings, the King of great Bri∣tain, and the King of Spain, whereby danger may grow of the inter∣ruption of Entercourse and Commerce, then the Subjects of either King are thereof so to be admonished, as that they may have six moneths from the time of the munition, to transport their Mer∣chandise without any arrest, disturbance or hurt in the mean season to be given unto them, either in their Persons or Merchandizes. By this Provision made, its clear that the King of Spain did un∣justly lay hold of, and keep our estates, and imprison our persons; therefore as it hath been the honourable practice of the Supreme Powers of this Common-wealth, to see its subjects righted from Forreigners in most Treaties of late; we hope the like course will be taken when a Peace shall be agitated, and not only reparation for the goods imbarged at the beginning of the War, but of ma∣ny other injuries and losses done to the Merchants of this Nation before, contrary to the Articles of Peace, while we were in amity with Spain, which then were complained of, and will still be made
out by proofs of the persons damnified, when they shall have an op∣portunity afforded them to do the same. Secondly, that all the Subjects of this Common-wealth may en∣joy the free exercise of their Religion, without being molested by the Inquisition, or any other Church-officers: and in the most signal places, where the greatest Factories reside, that there may be tolera∣ted Ministers to preach in our Consuls, or some other person of authority his house; and no Spaniards to give scandal at times of meet∣ing, it being but high Reason we should prize our own Religion, as much, if not more, then they do theirs, which have liberty to exercise the same in any Ambassador, or other houses here, without contradiction. Also we ought to have allowed select places for the burying our dead, at such times as we think fit, in that formerly we were necessitated to do it by stealth in the night, with much ha∣zard of our persons, and many have been most barbarously taken out of their graves, and exposed to be devoured by beasts, &c. Thirdly, when any person of this Nation dies in that Countrey, though intestate, that the Court of the Cruzada, may not at all meddle with the deceased's estate, but that the whole may come to his Correspondents and Friends in England, without interrupti∣on, for it hath been the practice of that Court to seize on whatso∣ever remaines of men, that die without making Wills, and have put those to whom the estate belongs to great Charges, in proving their Propriety, and afterwards by one pretence or other, keep them from their right, remaining with all. Fourthly, that all question of Contrabando be taken off, touching our English Manufactory, and that full credit be given to such dis∣patches and Certificates, as our ships shall carry from the Custom-houses of England, otherwise there will not want Informers, that may bring the clearest thing in doubt, and once a Suit it commenc't in such cases, commonly the greater part, if not the whole Principal is spent, ere the matter be decided, to the undoing of many a man, and hindrance of the Commerce in general. Fifthly, that the extraordinary Charges of Vizits, from the Con∣trabando and Inquisition be taken off, and though a ship come full of any Commodity into Port, and cannot dispose thereof, the Owner may have free liberty to seek his Market elsewhere, without paying duties for more then he lands, and taking any from the shore again, that will not spend the custome thereof, to be returned, and the ship to depart at pleasure.
Sixthly, that the English Merchants may sell in any part of Spain, Corne, Fish, or any other Commoditie, at the rates they shall think good, and the ordinary Justice there, not to put a set price, as in some places they formerly have done to our damage, and disturbance of traffick. Seventhly, that whatsoever goods we once dispatch, and pay the duties thereof, shall never be questioned by any of the Kings Mi∣nisters, either of such as we import there from England, or lade from Spain to other places, neither that we be bound to bring Cer∣tificates of the landing our commodities in Ports, at amity with the Crown of Spain, as hath been the practice, to the losse of many mens estates, upon false Informations, losse of Certificates, or the Judges not admitting them for good, though authentick, when they came, taking advantages of our securities given in that be∣half, and molesting both them and us. Eighthly, that no Merchant be liable to produce his Books of Ac∣counts to any of the Kings Ministers, as hitherto they compelled them to do, or for avoiding thereof drew from us great bribes. Ninthly, that nothing of Imposition be extracted from any of this Nation for Custome, of what they carry to, or bring from Spaine, more then what was paid, when the last Articles were made, nor that we be enjoyned to pay taxes, or lend money to the King or his Officers, upon what occasion soever, nor be put out of such houses wherein we live, for the accommodating any of the Kings Ministers, as in times past many were compelled to do. Tenthly, that our Trade may be general in all the King of Spain his Dominions, or if a Restriction should be in the parts of Ameri∣ca, it will be requisite that Provision should be made for any vessels of ours, that by tempestuous weather, or other extraordinary Ac∣cidents, may be forc't from our own Plantations thither, so as they may be friendly used while there, and have leave to depart when they list on their employments. Eleventhly, that Consuls and Vice-Consuls to assert the Nations Priviledges, and see the performance of Articles, and keeping our Factories in better order, (as to the more beneficial managing the Trade) be seated in the most important places of Spain, sufficient∣ly impowered to that purpose. Many other Particulars may be by the Merchants afforded to the State as necessary, when a Treaty shall be on foot, as they shall be call'd upon to do it. FINIS.
