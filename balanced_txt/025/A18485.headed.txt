An Admonition giuen by one of the Duke of Sauoyes Councel to his Hignesse, Tending to disswade him from enter∣prising against France. Translated out of French, by E. A. LONDON Printed by Iohn VVolfe. 1589.
An Admonition giuen by one of the D. of Sauoyes Counsell, to his Highnesse: tending to disswade him from enter∣prising against France. MY Lord, Sith I am borne your subiect, and that nature and reason doe binde me to serue and obey you: also that next vnto the seruice of God, I am to frame and direct whatsoeuer my acti∣ons and thoughts to the preseruation of your estate, the greatnesse and pro∣speritie thereof, and the peace and be∣nefite of all that are likewise borne vn∣der your obedience: I can not in this late entrie into the warre which your highnesse do begin, but bring for my part such seruice and abilitie as I may, as well to auoide idlenesse whilest other are busied, as to shew some proofe of my fide∣litie, and to beare witnesse of those benefites and commodi∣ties which all your subiects, as also my selfe, haue hitherto re∣ceiued and made triall of vnder your gouernement. Some one will bring in his weapons and valiancie: some other wil contribute his coine and commodities: some other his arte and industrie: and all generally, whatsoeuer may aduaunce and set forward your enterprise. But I, contrarie to the rest, doe come with a most humble admonition, conteining the most apparant reasons which on a sudden I could imagine, to withstande and contrarie them, so farre as in me lieth, and peraduenture as a new Cassandra, in fewe wordes to set be∣fore you, the importance and weight of that matter where∣in you nowe shippe your selfe: as being steadfastly perswa∣ded, that by diswading you, I shall doe more then all your captaines and armie, whether for your highnesse particular∣ly, either for the benefite and quiet of your poore subiects, who stand amazed at the motion, mistrust the continuance, but especially doe doubt and feare some great mishappe and calamitie in the ende: and indeed I might well thinke my selfe periured and a traitour to that seruice which I owe to your highnesse, in case I shoulde not also contribute, and purposing to doe well, I should not, at the least, stay the
mischiefe and annoiance, to my power. Your highnesse, whether of your owne motion to extende your limittes, and by the right of good scituation and commoditie to appro∣priate vnto your selfe sundrie countries, holdes and townes, so to purchase reputation, and after the example of your pre∣decessours to atchieue notable and immortall memorie: either else by the perswasion and inducement of others, haue seised and gotten possession of Rauell, Carmagnolle, and generally the whole Marquisate of Saluces: also of Bri∣anson and some other fortresses in Daulphine: and now with the like full winde, doe thither leade a great and mightie ar∣mie, in hope to multiplie your conquests and annexe this prouince of Daulphine (which for the greatnesse and impor∣tance thereof haue long since beene dedicated to the eldest sonne of the house of France) to your territories of Piedmont and Sauoy. You finde all things requisite for the intertain∣ment of this armie, as you woulde wish: the hearts of your souldiers & men of warre well disposed: your treasurie and storehouses well furnished: France so diuided, turmoiled and fleshed in and against it selfe, that in your owne iudgement, you haue no cause to feare, and, which is more, sundrie of the greatest and most mightie with weapon in hand doe call and fauor you: assurāce also of all helpe & succor from the Catho∣like maiestie & our holy father, whose authoritie, power, wea∣pons & means, are terrible to the whole worlde: with great apparance and coniectures you foresee a dissipation and partition of the state and crowne of France, and that euerie man will carrie away his morsell: and you presuppose that you haue as good right as the rest, as beeing sonne and hus∣band to Princesses of the blood of Fraunce and house of Va∣lois: finally mooued and led by a holy and religious intent, you purpose to preuent the ruine and subuersion of the ho∣lie, Catholike & Apostolike Religion in this prouince, which is halfe banished and cannot long subsist without speedie re∣medie. Thus doe you find your purpose to bee both honest and easie: The successe hitherto doeth also put you in great hope of as happie an ende: and that at the least by the lawe of shipwracke and waste, so much as maie lie nea∣rest your coast must belong to you. These indeede are great and mightie motions, sufficient to encourage the
most fearefull, to stirre vp the least ambicious and to moue euen the slowest and most duetifull: sithe such facilitie is found to concurre with honour and commoditie: as also it is the cause of worldly matters and the naturall order of generation that springeth of corruption: and in such ca∣ses especially the taking holde of fitte occasion is it that woorketh the fairest and most permanent effectes. Yea, I will graunt that the Gangrene hauing seised vpon the mid∣dest of this great bodie (as it hath) the members and out∣warde partes maie well bee cut off for the preseruation of the rest: But yet, if your Highnesse will consider and weigh such reasons, difficulties, and empeachments as are therein, I am assured you shall finde them to bee of farre greater importaunce then all that haue yet beene pro∣pounded. First, it is but too certaine that all changes from a long peace into a sudden and great warre are most dangerous, the rather because the peaceable person is lesse trained to warre▪ lesse accustomed to suffer and beare, and lesse fit to endure a∣nie tedious enterprise: and this if it be true in states that are in strength and power equall, which through a certaine mutuall feare doe mainteine and vpholde themselues, much rather then among vnequall Lordshippes, of whome the lesser most looke to keepe and maintaine themselues, rather then to enterprise against or assaile the greater. This is the ve∣rie lawe of nature imprinted euen in all creatures, among whom the small doe yeeld to the great, and are to account it a fauour and courtesie that they bee not bruised and euen swalowed vp. Nowe therefore what proportion is there betweene your highnesse power and the power of Fraunce: which is twentie or thirtie times greater then all that you possesse: peopled and abounding accordingly: trayned and exercised in warres these thirtie yeares continual∣lie? Haue not wee (without seeking anie further) an example, euen of late, of the losse of all the landes that you possesse, as well on this side, as beyonde the Alpes: also of the extremitie whereto your late father of hap∣pie memorie was for a long time brought, onely in ha∣uing too mightie an enemie of the Frenchman? Doe not the sounde of the warres of Piemont, which the passage
of the power and troopes through this countrie still ring in our eares? Is there any thing more easie or commodious for the French man, then to bound and limit the confines of his realme euen with the Alpes: & as it were by the way to tame end subdue vs? If therefore the example of your parents ru∣ine & ouerthrow should restraine you, much more the quiet enioying of his estate after hee hath recouered it, wherein himselfe inuiolably remained, ought to instruct and diuert you from so rash an enterprise. He had purchased (and that iustly) the fame to be one of the wisest and most staied prin∣ces of Europe, but especially for that among so manie his neighbours troubles & warres, he had abstained from warre and kept his countries in peace: and yet had great experi∣ence in warlike affaires: wanted no intelligences, or parta∣kers in France, and saw it in as great diuisions and flame of warres, as nowe it is in: and as for wealth hee hath left you so much as maie suffice to furnish the entertainment of a ve∣rie great armie: as wiselie foreseeing the incertaine ende of warres, which for the most part are sweete at the beginning, but difficult in the prosecution, and most bitter and hurt∣full in the ende. Yea, and the same aduice and counsaile did he giue the French king nowe raigning, when at his returne out of Polelande hee passed through his Countrie: and for want of following it, his affaires haue had so badde successe. This is and ought to bee vnto you a patterne and rule of conduct for your estate, which by this meanes hee hath as∣sured and left vnto you, flourishing and full of all wealth and commoditie: his instructions and domestical precepts, pro∣ceeding of so great and tried a iudgement, ought with you to preuaile aboue all other either gracious or flattering counsailes. Yea, hee neuer attempted any thing against the Switzers, who in power are nothing equall with Fraunce, but contrariwise, choose rather to leaue and abandon vnto them part of the lands that they had vsurped vpon him, then to attempt the euents of warre against that so warlike a na∣tion. Haue not our selues, and that of late yeeres, seene what happened to the king and kingdome of Portugall, which had so long flourished in a happie peace, and euen in a moment is perished and extinct through rash enter∣prising to assaile a mightier then him selfe vpon a vaine
shew and hope, which neuerthelesse seemed to be very well grounded, yea euen vpon pietie and religion. All histories are ull of like examples, neither neede I a∣ny further to delate the reasons: for in the end, if the lesser will warre vpon the greater, he must doe it onely by practi∣ses and drifts, by corruption and rewardes, and by a politike discretion which the wisest did alwaies practise: that is, still to nourish the warres and diuisions, if there be any: and still to feede the fire, not to quench it, that they may haue nei∣ther leasure nor power to thinke vpon any other then them selues and for them selues. The Catholike Maiestie hath a∣boue all thinges very well obserued and practised this re∣medie, yea and that so happely, that France, which hereto∣fore vpon lesse occasion and pretence would haue inuaded and set foote in his lands, hath now refused them when they were offered: as finding it selfe brought to that passe, that it was time to imploy all endeuours to quench the fire of ciuil warres which were kindled euerie where. True it is that England, which is as mightie in respect of Spaine, as you in respect of France, hath in part returned it to him, and for these twentie yeares & more, haue very cunningly entertai∣ned and nourished the warres in the low countries, and ther∣by hath warranted it selfe from a threatned inuasion and ruine. What els then doe you in departing from these do∣mesticall and fresh examples, other then the contrarie? You weake, doe assaile one strong: you in peace and assured in your State, do hazard it to the perill of an vncertaine warre: you that hold your estate of France, stand greatly bound vnto her, and of late of meere courtesie haue receiued Sa∣uiglian and Pignerothes, through so great an offence as is the assailing and seising vpon her townes and territories, doe incurre so notable a blemish of ingratitude, which can not be cloaked vnder whatsoeuer pretence: If iniuries and offences be aggrauated and accounted of according to the vnworthinesse of the offender, together with the qualitie and quantitie of the offence. If wrong done to an afflicted person, be accounted greater then that which is done to one in prosperitie: If the misdemeanors of parents towards pa∣rents, of friendes towards friends, of seruants towards their maisters, of children towards their parents, and of subiectes
towarde their Lords, haue euermore beene accounted exe∣crable, & they punished as paricides. With what reason or co∣lour may your enterprise be manteined, sith you can not al∣ledge any necessitie, or offence before giuen? But contrarie∣wise that you leauy warre against him that had gotten all your countrie, and hath giuen it you againe: that hath bound you by oth, and hath kept it with you: whose vassall through some of your Lordships you are, and vnto whom, as vnto the mightiest, without comparison, you owe all due∣tie and feare. There is (said a certaine auncient) no warre iust, but that which is necessarie: but you seeke this of a io∣litie, and that not without some spot of impietie and ingra∣titude, whether against God, who is the God of hostes, sith against your own conscience and religion, you assault a most Catholike king: whether against your honor and commo∣ditie: either els against the peace and calamitie of your poore subiects, who can not expect any other then the mi∣serable ruin and losse of all their goodes: for (to bee briefe) doe you thinke, that a king of France will put vp such an iniurie, at a Duke of Sauoyes hand? Either if he would, that so many princes of his bloud, so many great Lords and offi∣cers of his crowne: so many braue and couragious Cap∣taines: so warlike nobilitie: so many townes and so much people, in whose harts and affections the Floure de Luce hath taken roote so many worlds agoe, wil brooke such an inuasi∣on, and will not speedely be reuenged, and with a miserable spoile, force and confine you into your Piedmont, and so we in these partes remaine a pray to the conquerors? What pro∣fit shall you then reape of all your conquests, except accor∣ding to the prouerbe, in fishing for some small fish, to lose a golden hooke of farre greater value. What may you els haue done but quenched that fire which you should haue kind∣led, vnited those whom you shoulde haue set at debate, strengthened the members of a most mightie bodie, in the weakening whereof it had beene your profit to haue im∣ploied all your industrie: In summe, ceased their warres and diuisions, the continuation whereof is your good and pre∣seruation. It is too common a prouerbe, yet to some pur∣pose: That dogges do often fight together, yet so soone as they spye the woolfe, they leaue their brawles, and together
runne against the common enimie: so likewise brethren and kinsmen otherwise at strife and deuided, vpon the tou∣ching of the honour of their familie and house, laying aside all rancor and enimitie, or at the least, deferring it, doe de∣fende them selues, in and against all: and naturall affection surmounteth that which is but accidentall: the generall in∣terest reclaimeth and forceth them to forget the particular. Against you, the consideration of your smalnesse, and the greatnesse of the iniurie, being done in so wofull a time, which alwaies will be imputed to a bragge, insolencie, and rashnesse, will the more prouoke all France, and breede in them a speedie vnion and league: and the wisest will be very glad of such an occasion to ende their diuisions and partiali∣ties, as, surely there is no better way or certainer remedie a∣gainst ciuill warres, then to set vppon the enemies subiects. We read that the Romanes being on a time at iarre, the ene∣mie came into the towne and tooke the Capitoll, but they suddenly agreed to driue him away: The like did they against the Veients, and the princes & people of Thuscane, who du∣ring their ciuill warres had assailed them, and in lieu of get∣ting anie thing from them, remained vanquished & brought into subiection. The like did the Spanish nations when they so farre reuolted against the Emperour Charles the fift, as to force the D. of Calaber to take the crowne: for beeing in armes one against another, king Frances the first sent an ar∣mie and recouered the realme of Nauarre and Fontarabie: but the Spanish troubles being suddenly appeased, with one common consent thy fell vpon the French, and driue them out of all the land that they had conquered, and neuer after thought vpon their factions and reuolts: and we see ordina∣rilie that in townes and communalties the enuies, enmities and ielousies of particular persons are trode vnder foote so soone as the enemie doeth appeare, and all, euen they which before would haue slaine each other, doe with one mind run to defend the breach. Let vs not then deceiue our selues in too much flattering and reioycing in our forces and commodities, neither let vs perswade our selues that the Frenchmens diuisions are so rooted and grauen in them, that they cannot be soone taken away and appeased. The long cōtinuance of their mischiefes,
the extremities of the peoples miseries, the experience of that which is past, the small effect of their ciuill warres these 25, or 30. yeres, and especially these last troubles, longer and more pernitious thē the rest, which doe as it were vndermine the verie foundations of this Monarchie and estate, together with the obiect of an enemie, will prouoke them to vnitie & agreement. It is well knowen that in the estates now assem∣bled, most of the prouinces do require peace, that there be a great number of Catholike Lords that doe bewaile the mise∣ries of the estate, and with great impaciencie doe beare these ambitious commotions and proud innouations. Would you thinke that men do iudge it to be the Catho∣like Maiestie, vnder whose aduow, and with whose helpe you enterprise this warre, and that without such assurance you would not meddle. The Spaniard then, the hereditarie ene∣mie of France, is he that assaileth it: hee it is that seeketh to swallow vp the whole world vnder his Empire, & to become the sole and only Monarch thereof: he it is whose mortal ha∣tred is naturally grauen in euery true French hart, whose do∣minion is accounted cruell and intollerable, against whome the inhabitants of the low countries are reuolted, choosing rather to venture vpon so manie extremities, then againe to fall vnder his dominion: and now to this Spanish Cornet shal not the French eares bee open, their haires stand vpright, their hands be armed, neither the hearts of so manie princes, Lords, gentlemen, and others, both warlike and couragious, be puffed vp with a desire of reuenge, and the iust defence of their fellow citizens? or will they incurre so great a blemish of infamie and cowardlinesse, as to suffer themselues to bee wronged and prouoked by so weake and impatient an ene∣mie as you? To be briefe and without dissimulation, would the Catholike Maiestie forsake and abandon the recouerie of his countries to the end to denoūce a new war vnto France? Hee who with all his power and strength hath not beene a∣ble in twentie yeares to reduce two small prouinces, Holland and Zealand into his obedience, and of late hath incurred so great and notable a losse of noble Spanish Lords, captaines, and vessels, yea euen of his reputation in that great ouer∣throw and dissipation of his nauie, in the preparation wher∣of he had employed all his power for the conquest of Eng∣land,
will nowe enterprise against France which hath so oft withstood him, and whose armies to his losse hee hath so of∣ten felt and tried? Againe, who is ignorant of the great prac∣tises and intelligences of the king of Portugall, whose estate hath forciblie and by violence beene deteined by the Spani∣ard, who hath farre more interest in the preseruation of his conquests, and greater cause to preuent the losse and re∣uolts thereof, then to dreame else where? This consideration therefore must not amaze them, but they may be assured that hee will still employ his forces and meanes vppon his first purposes, which are more necessarie and honourable for him, besides that, it is well knowen that ordinarilie hee is crazed, and as it were in a manner at his ende: which if it should happen, his estates coulde not eschew great dissen∣tion, sedition and reuoltes, the sparkes whereof doe alrea∣die appeare in Spaine and else where, and then will it per∣aduenture bee too late for you to repent your ouer rash counsels. But admit you were assured of his succour and helpe, yet doe you not both see and heare the clashing of your neighbours the Switzers armes, who feare nothing so much as your prosperitie, and alone are sufficient to withstande you: who alreadie beginne to stirre: who doe inuite and counsaile the French to whom they are bound and confede∣rate, to withstand your purposes, and to force you to restore and yeeld vp that which you haue vsurped: you haue of late yeeres prouoked them, and yet through their discretion and vsuall forbearance, they haue bene desirous by treaties and capitulations to bring you to peace, and to withdraw your forces, rather then to enter into a daungerous warre: they know your meanes and pretences, also that to this day they detaine the Bailiwikes from you: and that your prosperitie or power is their ruine and hinderance: and therefore you maie be sure, that for their honour and reputation, whereof they are wonderfull iealous, together with their duetie to France, they wil withstand your purposes, & being wel vnited together, will part among thē this miserable countrie, wher∣in your self haue no wāt of such subiects, both great & smal, as bearing you but holow harts, would gladly shake of the yoke of your obedience, so to obteine liberty, & to free themselues
from such taxes and impositions you as haue laid vpō them. True it is that the Switzers are at iarre among them selues, also that you may haue many partakers, but the protestant Cantons are still the strongest, and will speedely lend all aide and succours to the Huguenotes of Daulphine their neigh∣bours, with whom they haue of long time had ordinarie fa∣miliaritie. In the meane time, we shall see whether the tongues and pennes of the wiser sorte at Geneua, whose interest herein is greatest, will be quiet: yea and in France, where there is a∣boundance of braue and good wits, whether they will not both in wordes and writing stirre vp euery true French hart against you and your ingratitudes, which they will exage∣rate, so that if heretofore thousands of Lordes and gentle∣men tooke vpon them the crosse for the conquering of such farre countries from the Sarazens, will they now suffer you to inuade their owne realme? Either will not this house of Bourbon, which after the kings discease that now raigneth, is called to the crowne: which also euermore haue brought forth such warlike and valiant princes, take hart and aduice how to maintaine and preserue that which iustly is their due? To be briefe, shall this noble bloud of France be as it were blemished and tainted with such cowardlinesse and want of courage, as to suffer that Prouince of France which hath the particular prerogatiue and priuiledge still to bee dedicated to the eldest sonne of the crowne and nearest heire thereof, be lost and vsurped by a straunger? will they not in such a case be touched with ielousie, and particularly with iust sorrow, which may prouoke and moue them to preserue their owne, sith at this day the crowne returneth to them: I speake generally, leauing all questions of law, and election of persons, and cleaue onely to the Salicque fonda∣mentall law, inuiolably obserued by the French, who aboue all nations haue euermore beene highly commended and renowned for their most faithfull obedience & loue to their kinges and the princes of their bloud. Together with the Switzers, the State of Venice, and the Duke of Mantua, who aboue all other doe feare the migh∣tinesse of the Spaniard and you, and are most desirous of the reestablishment and preseruation of the State of France,
will not faile to admonish the French king of the conse∣quence and importance of your enterprises, and, if need be, to contribute and enter confederacie for the hindering and breaking of them off. Thus of all your pretences and apparent inductions there remaineth no more but your intelligences and partakers, which you may haue in France, togither with the Catholike Apostolike, and Romish Religion, to the vpholding whereof, you take all faithfull Princes and Christians to be called and bound: How then? Who is more inclined, more bent, or more earnestly giuen thereto, then the French king nowe reigning, who vnder the reigne of his brother Charles, em∣ploied all his youth therein, and hath tried all wayes & for∣ces, secretly and openly, and all clemencie, for the rooting out of the contrarie religion, and euen now for the same end holdeth his estates? who also is so desirous to compasse it, that hee hath forgotten all particular friendship and hatred, and is purposed and resolued vpon no other thing, to the end afterward most happilie to end his dayes. This notwithstan∣ding, hee is still king, hee is endued with great gifts of the minde, and zealous of his honour: and as all other men, hee is capable of iust sorow when hee is prouoked and offended: will he then suffer his memorie to bee taxed in all posteritie and spotted with such ignominie, as to suffer the Duke of Sa∣uoy to bereaue him of the Marquisate of Saluces, and there∣in to rauish and take from him all tokens, reliques and mo∣numents of the kings his predecessours conquests in the realme of Naples and prouince of Italie? To seise vpon Car∣magnolles the Arsenoll of France? Now euen during his life to take an othe of fidelitie of his subiects, and to cause him∣selfe to be acknowledged as Lorde, dispatching all things in his owne name? And afterwarde by force of armes to enter his Realme, and to put garrison into his townes. In those extremities which vndoubtedly doe oppresse him, he will hasten against him that dismembreth, his estate, and as alreadie he hath sundrie times experimented, he will grant peace to his subiects, rather then in his dayes see his garments rent in sunder. So in the time of king Charles, in the yeare 1562. the troubles ceased almost as soone as the English set foote in France, and had gotten New hauen: and
his subiects agreed together to fall vpon the common ene∣mie. True it is, that his princes, nobilitie, townes & commu∣nalties are now at greater diuision, and more fleshed each a∣gainst other then they were then: that now there is more in their power and possession which helpe you, and togither with you do purpose the sharing of this realme. That these Lords your partakers are as it were masters of the state, and haue the strength and Metropolitane towne of the realme in their hāds: That it is vnpossible to reunite the harts that are thus alienated, and to regenerate and reduce into the hearts of the princes of the blood & mightie Catholike Lords, prin∣ces, gentlemen and subiects of the contrarie part, which are many, a confidence and loue of their king, and therefore the fire which still shall, be kindled in the heart of the realme, wil greatly let them from being able to succour the outwarde bounds. But what? The king, who by force & at the induce∣ment of his Lords, once made an edict of reunion with them, whereby they be bound to abandon all leagues and associa∣tions either within or without the realme, being (as he is) dulie aduertised of your intelligences with them, of the por∣tion that they graunt you of Prouince and D'aulphine, so as you also bind your selfe to expell those of the contrarie reli∣gion, and afterwarde to helpe them with your power and meanes, to make them likewise masters of their parts & por∣tions. The king, I say, who besides infinite others hath recei∣ued two iniuries and displeasures: this, the most shameful∣lest that euer Prince receyued: namely, to bee expelled out of his seate, the Parliament and principall towne of his realme, and afterwarde to be so farre iniuried as to be driuen to thrust from about him his most auncient and most faith∣full seruaunts and officers of the Crowne, to the ende him selfe to bee serued and possessed by them, not that hee chose but that were prescribed and presented vnto him: shall hee not both iustlie and honestlie goe from anie othe or woorde that hee maie haue promised vnto them without breach of fayth and promise? Shall not the Princes of the blood, the officers of the Crowne, the Parliaments, Nobilitie and Townes, the moste whereof doe see and knowe the euident inconueniences and domages of the continuation of the warres, admonish him to stay no longer
in this so straunge bondage, but to ridde and free himselfe from this tyrannie of these maisters of the Palace: to whose passions and ambitions hee is vtterly subiect. To be briefe, shall not the States, which represent the soundest part of the Realme, and are assembled togither to preuent the ca∣lamities and ruines which threaten it, seeing so great a mis∣chiefe to happen during their assemblie, conclude vppon a mutuall confederacie agaynst the authours thereof and all forreine enemies? Either shall not the king togither with them call to minde their originall aduauncement, and pro∣gression, togither with the bondes wherein they are bound to Fraunce, which in the meane time they nowe rent in sun∣der and dismember? These children be they not worse then their fathers, who with the like tyrannous ambition posses∣sed and brideled king Frances the second, & vnder his name and authoritie, did enterprise to put to death the chiefe prin∣ces of the blood of France, and fathers to the princes now li∣uing, albeit neither acknowledged, neither mainteined in their degrees and dignities vnto them due? Be not these they who through their sleights, haue alwayes mainteyned the warres of France, & had intelligence with the king of Spain, the sworne enemie of France, and of late receyued his coine, sought to deliuer Marseilles & diuers places into his hands: solicited the Prince of Parma with his Spanish power to en∣ter into Fraunce, and to make warre vppon their king, that hath so raysed and exalted them, that nowe they goe about to abase himselfe, whome they haue forced contrarie to all lawe both of God and man, and contrarie to all order in Fraunce, to name a successour: at this day doe forciblie detaine diuerse great Townes and Castels, yea euen the principall Citie of the Realme, and vse all those rea∣sons whereof your discouerie shall furnish a verie large campe? Shall not the king and princes awake out of their slumber and sleepe, to the ende to see and iudge what is prepared for them? I can not denie but there bee pari∣cides in Realmes and Empires: also that the wofull and hea∣uie destinie doe seeme to thrust and hale Fraunce to her ende: Neuerthelesse, were they no more but the king of Na∣uarres faction that withstoode you in Daulphine or else where, I say and aduowe that they are more then enowe
to thrust you backe into Piedmont, and to make you returne with shame and losse. These thirtie yeares well neare haue the French kings employed all their power and strength, which were without comparison greater then at this day, and bet∣ter vnited, against them: yet see we them still shoote vp againe and encrease more then euer, namely since the last commo∣tions in France, they haue taken more towns, woonne more battels, fortified more holdes, and more strengthened their partie then before: you are therefore to consider particular∣ly against which part of them you bende your selfe: viz. to those that are strong in townes, & multitude of warlike gen∣trie, if there be anie throughout the world, yea, and furnished with captaines of more experience: that is, those that tooke Montlimart, Ambrune, Die, Cap, and sundrie other: that de∣feated the armie of the Lord of Vins, and another at Mont∣limar, that inhabite a countrie by nature strong, of accesse difficult, for ambushes and stratagemes, wherin they are most excellent, verie conuenient: and that at need shall be succou∣red by their neighbors of Languedoc. Repose not therefore so much trust in the promises and power of your partakers, who with a good wil, wil helpe themselues with your means, men, and money, to establish their power and authoritie, whose behauiours doe alreadie make them odious and mis∣liked of the most part of France, which sigheth and groneth vnder the calamities that are sprung out of their ambition. The king now reigning is no elder then they, whose speedie ende wee are neither to feare, neither to hope for: if it should happen also, that all good French Catholikes should feare to fal into the obedience of a prince of contrarie religi∣on, yet the continuance of the calamities and mischiefs that vndermine them: the long proofe and tedious experience of the inabilitie of force and violence to force the minds to be∣leeue other then they would: the examples of the Germains and Switzers, which notwithstanding the pluralitie of religi∣ons doe liue peaceably inough: and the assurance that they haue of the clemencie and mildnesse of the king of Nauarre, who is he that chalēgeth to be presumptiue heire and eldest of the crowne, will still draw them to acknowledge him, and to yeeld vnto him the duties of faithfull and obedient sub∣iects, rather then to stoupe to the dominion of these new and
forraine princes. They know the king of Nauarre to be gen∣tle and mercifull, naturally not to be ambitious or a tyrant: they are not ignorant how often he hath desired and reque∣sted to be instructed by a free counsell: that hee is a prince of his faith and word, and that by force and constraint hee was driuen and compelled to take weapon, which he now hath in hande, whose equitie hath appeared in the happie successe that God hath giuen him against the armies of the Duke of Maine, the Marshall of Biron, and the Duke of Ioieuse, who thought to haue deuoured and swallowed him vp, yet hath he still had the victorie. If then with these vertues and per∣fections farre different from the cruelties and tragicall passi∣ons of his enemies, he get the crowne, what are you to hope or feare of so warlike a Prince? So sore bent against the Ca∣tholike Maiestie, which detaineth his kingdome, and so well beloued among your neighbors the Switzers? Cōsider there∣fore earnestly that the shortest follies are the best: that then your partakers shall be but small warrant vnto you, sith they no whit subsist of their owne forces, but of other mens one∣ly, and that with so extreeme violence as it cannot continue: for in the ende what foundation haue they of their power, o∣ther then of a broken reede: of the mutable minds of incon∣stant people, which forsake him whom before they fauoured so soone as they see his good hap abandon him, yea, and that doe not onely forsake him, but for the most part driue away, punish, or most shamefully murther him. Such there haue bin both in Athens and Rome, and being this day exalted to the heauens, haue bene to morow banished and cast down head∣long. And alredie it is verie likely that the Parisians wil short∣ly shake off that yoke which a while they thought so sweete, because they see themselues depriued of the presence of their king, which bred their great commoditie and profite, vpon the ceasing whereof will also cease their amitie and good will that they bare to the procurers of the ceassing of their pro∣fit and traficke. The same people (and iustly) doe feare the in∣dignation of their king whom they haue offended, and who is iustly wroth against them: as also they may iudge that hee dissembleth his wrath for a season, and that for this present he is cōtent with this punishment, viz. That he will not come at Paris. Euen this onely reason alreadie breedeth a repen∣tance
in the Parisians hearts, and a hatred of the authours, who haue offended and prouoked against themselues a num∣ber of the principall, the richest, & the best alied inhabitants. How will it be when the king shall so manifestly reueale his hatred, that hee shall take from them part of the extent of their Parliament (as is alreadie forecast) of the chamber of accounts of aides and other iurisdictions which are the cause that Paris is maintained in such resort & greatnesse? How wil it be when openly he shall bend himselfe against them, and take from them (as he may) so manie priueledges which by the kings his predecessors haue beene graunted them, and by himselfe confirmed? How will it be, when they shall per∣aduenture see themselues brought into like estate, as at this day are Gaunt, Lisbourne, Diieon, and manie other townes heretofore most flourishing? Shall they not then remember that it is because of their rebellions? Shall they not call to minde that the authours of the miseries of France, are also the authours of the miseries of Paris, and of all the countrie round about which is vtterly vndone, ruinated and wasted alreadie? Alreadie they taste and know that the ciuill warres haue debarred them of halfe their traficke, haunt and con∣course of people, and most of them doe curse the authours. Other townes by them detained, which also doe proue the like miseries, yea, and farre greater, which are subdued by Ci∣tadels and great garrisons, will after the example of Paris, seeke after alteration of gouernours & their former libertie. If at this day the king shew them anie fauour, yet is it a question whether it be but in appearance, or in truth, consi∣dering what offences and iniuries they haue wrought him▪ so that, albeit for a while he dissemble, yet he will find a time when to punish them, euen so soone as he shall see time and oportunitie: and then shall you be destitute of all such sup∣port as you hoped of, for the defence of your wrongfull en∣terprise: But admit they obtaine that fauour in deede and without dissimulation, yet can you bee assured that it will continue? Men are in all things variable, and especiallie in amities, and among men, the greatest are so when they per∣ceiue that his greatnesse whom they fauour may be hurtfull and preiudiciall to their owne estate: for there is nothing so subiect to iealousie as dominion: For that doe men forsake
all diuinitie and humanitie: and gouernement can brooke no companion. Againe, the manifest diuision among them ought to stay, yea vtterlie to breake off your enterprise, sith it is but o∣uer likely that their particular quarels will sufficientlie de∣barre them from helping of others: further that within these three yeares they haue vsed and layde all their endeuours, and haue sought, yet could not attaine to inuade the Duke of Bouillons souereigne territories, whereof they bee at this day in extreeme anguish. Their behauiour doe sufficientlie shew it. Hardly could they finde one generall to vndertake the conduct of their armie into Poytou: They are extreme∣lie indebted, vrged and tormented by their creditors: They owe more then they are woorth, and that is the cause that they hazard, not their owne, but France: They haue procu∣red the king of Nauarre to be moued to accorde, which if they could obteine, they would thinke themselues reasona∣blie safe: and when their enterprises shall bee (as it is verie likelie) brought to nought, themselues shall withall fall euen groueling to the ground. Here you see the pillars and bul∣warkes of your enterprise. Contrariwise, the king of Nauarre is grounded vpon a match made long since of great patri∣moniall goods: of the lawe of France, which calleth him be∣fore all others to the crowne, and especially of an incredible loue of his subiects, and all other his followers, which is the fairest and mightiest fortresse that princes may haue, and which maketh their memorie most famous and happie with the posteritie: He is, I say, like vnto a second Traian euen a∣mong the Catholikes, beloued, no lesse for his goodnesse and clemencie, then for his valiancie. Thus in my opinion I haue sufficiently answered concer∣ning the pretence of Religion which they might make you take hold of, which also beareth more semblance then truth, how much wiselier haue your late father and your selfe dealt in forbearing forciblie, and by constraint to reclaime your poore inhabitants of the valley of Angrongne and other their neighbours, who neuerthelesse are but one handfull of people in respect of these of Daulphine whome you doe as∣saile. Content your selfe therefore with the same estate wher∣in hitherto your selfe, and before you your late father found
ease. For vnder what colour would you at this day, in a for∣reine land, fight against a Religion which these thirtie yeares haue beene tollerated in your owne Countries. Rather bee you a beholder of the storme that beateth and tormenteth the sea of France: expect the issue of that tragedie: either, if you bee so desirous to purchase reputation, conuert your meanes and forces towarde your father in lawe the king of Spaine, for the recouerie of the low Countries: and, resem∣bling the phisition, which comming to the ende of the sicke∣nesse, is vsually the happiest, and carieth away the credite of the cure, sith the Duke of Alua, the great commaunder, and the prince of Parma could not yet atchieue the victorie, get you the honour of finishing it: so doing you shall trauaile in a better title, and your weapons shall bee more honourablie and better employed, besides that you shall not incurre the vice and reputation of ingratitude to your benefactors: you shall warrant your poore subiects from the affliction and op∣pression that warres doe vsuallie bring. And if zeale of Reli∣gion doth lead and so mightilie mooue you, you may there fight against contrarie Religions which haue beene long there, and are in diuerse points different from yours. There shall you find the English, against whom the Catholike Maie∣stie is at open warre, who durst fauor and vndertake the pro∣tection of the Hollanders and Zealanders, who first offering themselues to the French king (who was more religious and carefull in keeping his league and peace with Spaine) were refused. For my part I will pray vnto the Creator for the prosperitie and encrease of your highnesse, as Your most humble and most obedient subiect and seruant.
