A Letter sent from M. Chappell out of Ireland, to a friend of his in London. YOur Letter bearing date the 28 of the last Month, I have re∣ceived, being sorry to heare of your discontents in London but I hope God will in his good time turne all to the best: for those that that truly feare him. Our Rebellion heare day∣ly increaseth, so that we cannot travell any way from this City above a mile or 2 without danger; since S. Samuel Harcourt came over, we in this City have been much incouraged, his men were landed on Newyears day, and though they were but one regiment, concisting but of 7 Companies yet they have bred some terror to our enemies, who before reported that the King would send us no help, and cals us English Rebels; they began to incamp close about us at Clantaf, which is but 2 miles hence; but Sr. Charles Coote, the week before Christmas, with about 1500 horse and foot march towards them, and was with them as soon as there was any light in the morning, and put them to slight; some he kill'd some he caused to be hanged, and 3 or 4 he took prisoners, and after the Town was pillaged by his Souldiers, he set it a fire with the Corne, which fire was not out in 3 or 4 dayes after: it is thought that there were at least 2000 Rebels in the Town when Sr Charles came to it, he lost not one man at that time that I can heare of.
