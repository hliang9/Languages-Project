TO THE READER. UPON a late Dispute concerning the Author of the Book, Entituled, Eikon Basilike, it was by some affirmed, that they had the first Impression of the said Book with Prayers as they are now Printed and added to the End thereof, (by one of the Impressions in 12o. of the King's Works, printed in 1650. at the Hague by Sam. Browne; in the said Book are divers of his Majesty's Prayers, whereof the three last used by him in the time of his Restraint, were delivered to the Bishop of London at his death, from whom they were taken away by the Officers of the Army, and amongst these Six Prayers, that entitled to be said in Time of Captivity, and taken out of Sir Phillip Sidney's Arcadia, is not one of them, however it came to be printed and added in some Editions of them.) As to which being desirous to know the Truth as well for my own as others satisfaction, I endeavoured to make as full a search as I could, and to that end, did not only enquire at the Booksellers Shops in Lon∣don and Westminster, but as far as my Interest would permit me, did cause to be made search both in Private Libraries of several Gentlemen, and Divines, and Publick ones at Oxford, &c. (having before seen several of those which were affirmed as aforesaid to be the first Edition) where I found the above∣mentioned Twenty Eight several Impressions or Editions of the King's Book without the Prayers, and the Twenty Seven Editions with the Prayers added at the End of the said Book; all which being transmitted to me, I took the said Account with all the exactness I could, by noting (lest there should happen any mistake) the size of the Volumn, the time of Printing, the number of Leaves the Contents did consist of, and the number of the Pages, all which I testifie under my hand At the Turks-head in Fleet-street, June the 15th. 1693. SAMUEL KEBLE. I shall insert a Letter, transcribed from the Original, which I have by me, written by Mr. Levet. The Superscription of the said Letter runs thus, For Seymor Bowman, Esq near the Arch in Lincolns-Inn-Fields. Dear Brother, Licensed, May the 10th. 1691. By Z. Isham. YOurs of the 21th. of this instant April I received, and one Letter before that to the same effect, viz. To give a true Account of my knowledge of that unparallel'd Book, which his Sacred Majesty, of ever blessed Memory, King Charles the First (murdered by his own Rebellious Subjects before his own Palace at Whitehall, with all the violent and malitious Circumstances that Wicked men could invent) which Book, of my certain Knowledge, I can depose, was truly His own, having observed His Majesty oftentimes writing His Royal Resentments of the bold and insolent behaviour of His Souldiers (His Rebellious Subjects) when they had Him in their custody. I waited on His Majesty as Page of the Bed-Chamber in ordinary during all the time of His Solitudes, (except when I was forced from Him) and especially being nominated by His Majesty to be one of His Servants, amongst others, that should attend Him during the Treaty at Newport in the Isle of Wight, had the happiness to read the same oftentimes in Manuscript under His Majesty's own Hand, being pleased to leave it in the Window in His own Bed-chamber,
where I was always obliged to attend His Majesty's coming thither. But the Treaty being ended in few days after, the Souldiers with one to conduct them, by name Mr. Anthony Mildmay then Cup-bearer, came to the Bed-chamber, about Two of the Clock in the Night, and knocked at the Door, and one Mr. Herbert, Mr. Kirk, and my self having some hint of their Intentions, were watching in an inward Room, and hearing the noise, went into His Majesty's Bed-Chamber, and asked, who they were that durst disturb His Majesty at that unseasonable time of the Night, who answered, they were sent to tell the King, He must rise and go with them. We acquainting His Majesty with their Design, He was pleased to command us to tell them, He would go with them, but it was not His usual hour to rise so soon, we again acquainted the Souldiers with His Majesty's Answer. They instead of complying with His Majesty, bid us tell Him, if He did not rise presently, they must force Him to it: His Majesty only said, if I must, give me my Cloaths, and so He immediately arose. (Here you may observe a mirror of Pa∣tience in a distressed Prince.) During the time of His Majesty's making himself ready, he con∣cern'd himself only how to secure this Book of his, and a small Cabinet, wherein he secured his Letters to his Queen, who was then beyond the Sea, and His Majesty having procured a Pass for me from the Governour, that I should wait on him there; He gave me in charge this said Book and small Cabinet, which I faithfully presented to His Majesty's own hands that Night in Hurst-Castle. But the Governour, by what information is too tedious to insert here at this time, and therefore I omit it, did on the Saturday banish me out of the Castle. I should have sent you a Relation which I had from Royston, the King's Printer, for the Printing the said Book by His Majesty's especial Command, brought to him by a Divine, but not to beBy Printed, is to be understood, Published. printed till after the King's death, which he observed accordingly, for which Cromwel sent for him to Whitehall, not only promising Rewards, but also threatning Punish∣ment, if he would not deny, that he printed it by His Majesty's Order, which he refusing to do, did imprison him for about a Fortnight, but seeing he could not work upon him, released him; which is all at present from From Savernack Park near Marlborough, Apr. 29. 1691. Your Affectionate Brother, To serve you WILLIAM LEVETT. LONDON, Printed for Sam. Keble at the Turks-Head, in Fleet-street, 1695.
