humorous Tricks and Conceits of Prince ROBERTS Malignant She-Monkey. EVery maid, nay every whore, in expectation by her good carriage to obtain a husband, will behave themselves in a very demure manner, and couzen the Devil with hypocri∣ticall modesty; But Prince Roberts Monkey having not so much policy as her Master, laid her self so open to the view of the world; that every one without peeping might ok upon, nay into the Monkey, so that her bad looks and deformed vi∣ge, and the mad malignant tricks which she plaid in the flower of her outh made her despaire of a husband, and to remaine uncourted, much ore unmarried in regard of her vicious malignity of her tricks and qua∣ies, she having no portion to guild over these faults or tricks following: irst, she was alwayes unconstant changing her affection, oftner then her ock, and it is supposed that she learnt her giddy actions either from rownists, or her halfe cosins, which are Baboones: And when as maids ould simper and dissemble there desires, this Monkey had a licorish ngue and a licorish taile, she would eat no oatmeal nor lome of walls o cure her green infirmitie, but the longest whitest sugar plums she could ut in her mouth were most delightfull to her taste, and had such a ravi∣ous appetite to fruit that she would swallow all but the stones, and having otten a delectable bit in her mouth (according to the manner of monkeys, e would onely suck the juice out of it and then spit out the rest; as if she ad had no more teeth then are in the gums of an old parish Midwife. And ecause she was alwayes a loose bodied thing, and desirous to have been ragling all mad to have lost her maiden-head, therefore she was tied to he nave of a wheel, so fast that an Italian padlock could not keep a Mon∣ey more safe and close from others handling; moreover this Monkey was and is by nature a notable plunderer not onely of studdies and closets nto which if she got she would teare the books, spill the ink, and eat the weetmeats, but many times under the colour of love or rather lust, this Monkey in familiar manner sitting by her sweet-hearts would plunder
and pick their pockets, which was indeed a very base fault, and a who trick: when she was not above fifteen yeers old, an old man that wa wrinkled and deformed as her self came a wooing to her; and this she Monkey, (having learnt to plunder from Prince Robert plunderd the po old Gentleman of all his Rings, of his Watch and of his Purse that  in his pocket, and would never so much as open her mouth to give hi any satisfaction or thanks for it, so that the old Gentleman paid de¦ly for his wooing, and had onely a sensible feeling of the Monkey, an her malignant tricks, this Monkey also hath plundred many a young m that stood for the Cause, and hath got from them scarfs, gloves, bodkins, Rings and other commodities, and is more insatiate then the city Lottery, for bring in what you will if this Monkey once get hold of it, she will not part with a pin-till till her own turne be satisfied, which was a greedy hu¦mour and a trick that a longtime spoild this Monkeys marriage, moreove this Monkey was alwayes a cunning Jugler, so that when Souldiers ha received their pay, when there hands were in her placket, her hands woul be in there pockets, and though they felt the Monkey at the very same in∣stant, yet they had not the power to take such sure hold of her as to car∣ry her before a Magistrate, but she would cunningly slip away from them and leave them no money in their pockets, nor any thing in their hands but a rusty musket or a pike, for she would get away to bed and laugh next day with open mouth to think how she had guld the souldiers, so that the souldiers cried a pox on this Monney, we can never keep any money for this She Monkey. If she went to Church she was alwayes close vaild like a Nun, and when she was in the most holy picture of praying, though her mouth many times opened, yet she could not pray by the spirit but would hold her peace or else the desires of her mumping minde were that such or such a young man were preaching in her pulpit, and indeed many Schollers and preachers after service was done did love to handle the Monkey better then they did their text, and it is thought that some of them would never have married if it had not been for love of the Monkey. But amongst other tricks that hindered this Monkeys marriage, that was one chief matter, she could never keep her legs together, but would throw them abroad in such an obscene manner, that any of the Cavaleers with a Carbine charged with two bullets might easily enter her maiden
Fort, rifle all the treasures of her virginity, and come off safe and sound with a pox to them, and so she would be revenged of her enemies; for many of the Caveleers that were malignants to the Parliament, were more beaten and foiled by this Monkey then by all their forces, so that their bones in the language of diseases cryed peccavi, or a pox of Prince Roberts malignant Monkey. Her last trick was a very bad quality, and that was, when she was drunk she would let any one take up her smock, if she had it, and so discover her Monkey. Well, every dog hath his day, and every Monkey may get her match. It fortuned, that Cupid, to be re∣venged of the Cavaleers in Oxford, made him cast his eye, and with it his affection upon this Monkey, and though he could not finde any parti∣cular good quality in her, yet he loved her exceedingly in the whole, and most especially he doated upon her Monkey; after this, wooe her he did, and still when he was on horseback, or on on footback, he still thought upon his Monkey; once he drew out his sword at Grises Taverne in Ox∣ford, and the close shutting of the Oister, and the opening of it afterward, made him think of his beloved Monkey; then he would drink healths, and swear (God dam me) you shall pledge my Monkey, she is my Mi∣strisse, fill it all out Sir: But one day the Cavaleer having with too much familiarity angered the Monkey, she bit him very shrewdly, so that the Cavaleer grew exceeding sick, and afterward when he was recovered, he made this conceit on his Monkeys displeasure, and biting bitternesse: Monkey, nay fie, Why dost thou frown on me? And will thy countenance never better be. A pox upon thee and thy false fair looks, In stead of favors thou givest me French knocks. But love is a fire not to be quenched, for assoon as the hot Cavaleere was grown coole and healthfull, he desired again to be dealing with his Monkey, and drew a long Letter, the Contents whereof pleased her ex∣ceeding well, so that she resolved to be fast joyned in Matrimony to the Cavaleere, and the Cavaleere thought to cock his Car∣bine, and match his Monkey. The wedding day was appointed to be kept in Nullibi Colledge or Broadgates Hall, a Dinner was provided, but the Monkey sat all dinner time very demure, and was so possest with the strong imagination of what shall be done at night, so that she could not eat a bit, but smiled inwardly to her self, to think how the Cavaleere
would tickle her Money; when dinner was done the Monkey & the C¦valeers dance to the tune of Iump to thy Cousin and kisse, and the Mon was so heated with dancing, that she was ready to have dropped her m¦denhead upon the rushes: Well, the Cavaleers rested, and toyed with the Monkey, that sat simpering, with a watering mouth, to think of the plea∣sures she should enjoy at night. At last night, being looked for, came and the Cavaleer, and the Monkey were with great Ceremony broug into their chamber, and when they were in bed all the company left them And now the Cavaleer like a blushfull Scholar did his acts in his tenebr and what they were you must imagine, suppose them now at there mid¦night sport, which be done over and under again; they were early in the morning saluted by this song composed by a Scholar of Oxford on the marriage of the Monkey and the Cavaleer. No blushing fayre, nor morning red, Peep through your curtains closely spred, Prince Roberts Monkey that long taried, Is to a Caveleree married: So wrinkled, so wondrous wrinkled, And of such a comely grace, When she is naked, I dare be baked If the Divel himself have such a face. Sheele gape widely and mop and mowe, And is hairy above and below, And if she get a bit doth like her The Monkey is an errant striker, So wrinkled, so wondrous wrinkled, And of such a comely grace, When she is naked, I dare be baked If the Divil have such a face. The next day the Scholars of Oxford made many Epithalanions in praise of the Monkey. And after they had made this song they gave it to the Cavaleers, who sung it to a merry new tune cald the Monkey, Prince Roberts Monkey is a toy, That doth exceed his dog cal'd Boy, Which through dogged folly, Both barkes and bites, But this delights The Prince when's melancholy. He puts Sweetmeats and sugar plumbs, Into his Monkeys toothlesse Gumbs Which open like an Oyster, For he doth esteeme A wench I meane; More then a Nun in Cloyster, And tell his Caveleeroes bold, That live at Oxford uncontrold, When as they are halfe drunkish, Their heat to quench, Weele have a wench That lusty is and Monkish. All happinesse and joy betide, Vnto the Monkey now a Bride; Whose Mayden-head was minsty, Her hey nonny no Was mouldy also, Till she married a Cavaleer lusty.
But this same Cavaleer did trounce her, And with his Petronell did bounce her, And when he was halfe drunkish, He made her sport And entred the fort, That lusty was and onkish. After the wedding night had been spent in the sweet contents of love, he Cavaleere rose out of his bed from his hellish Venus, being worse beaten, and more sore and weak in his back and joynts, then ever he was when he was beaten at Warwick, or any other Town from whence the Cavaleers were repulsed: he thought the Devill had been in the Mon∣key, that could make him so weak, so wondrous weak, as if he had lost all the bloud in his body; whereupon he resolved to favour himselfe hereafter, and not to come on in such a furious manner, and endanger the breaking of his Carbine, or fiering it in the Monkeys touchole: so he went poore Cavaleere to get a Caudle made, and took many restoratives to fortifie his back again, intending to keep a good while out of his Mon∣keys mouth, having been so shrewdly bitten on his wedding night. Now while the Cavaleere endeavoured to recover his strength again, the Mon∣key after she was married, began to play the second part of malignant ttricks: And first, she began to straggle abroad, and when she got loose, she would run to one Taverne or other with her Gossips, and there they would sit and drink, and condemne their husbands for being too slack in pleasing their Monkeys. For you must now suppose the Monkey was mad, because the Cavaleere did forbear to come on as he was wont to do; and because she would make the Cavaleere mad, she set a Cullender by her bed side, when she had occasion to make water, she took it and made her distillations therein, so that all her urine ran about the bed, and the Cavaleere lay souced in the Monkey salt pickle, so that her husband being extreamly vext after he had sworne two or three oaths, and  many farts he leaped out of bed, and left the Monkey to coole herself in the empty bed, but her bed was not long empty; for after the Cavaleer was gone, a Scholar of Oxford had a great desire to leave off poring in his book, and instead of plodding on the deep liberal Sciences, he had, minde to peep into the Monkeys black Art or Arse, and so accord as to former appointment the Scholar thought to have about with the Monkeys Nunquam Jatis, and thereupon slipt of his breeches and slipped into bed,
and so the Scholar perfectly performed his Acts, and came off with  and so betimes in the morning tooke his vale of the Monkey. But  behold the last and most divellish malignant trick that the Monkey  which she performed in this manner. It chanced that after the Cav had a long time forborne the Monkeys bed; (as was formerly related  young Scholar of Oxford make him Cornutus, and afterward the next  that they fell out, she discharged her malice against him in many w which flew as thick as hail shot, and and at last she discharged a bullet that hit the Cavaleer in the heart, telling him that although they had b married but three days, she had not been idle but had made him as a a Cuckold as any in Oxford or in London, when the Cavaleer heard  he swore Dammee, Dammee, Dammee this Monkey is a Devil, she al broke my back in the wedding night, and now she hath turned a Cava into a Cuckold, I am horne mad, I am worse now then a Round head, I will be revenged upon her for making me a City Cavaleer or Cucko I will therefore go to the Tavern, be drunk, and write verses against all whole generation of Shee-Monkeys. This Monkey married and in 3 dayes space She cald her husband Cuckold to his face, The Cavaleer was vext, and thus he sayes Ha Drab, miscall thy husband in 3 dayes, A Cuckold (quoth she) may be Cavaleer Made in 3 days as well as in 3 yeer, For many have been Cuckolds, 'tis known well Twenty yeers, yet their wives dare not them tell, If every wife would so kind hearted be Husbands would nere be troubled with jealousie. The Cavaleers reply to his whorish Monkey. Monkey since thou dost prove unkinde, And false, maist thou still be blinde: And have no eyes, but at noone day Grope and let others find thy way, May thy mouth for anger grin When thou growest unfit for sin: And at last when as the haire Doth forsake it growe stark bare; A wretched thing, and onely good for That thou canst use it when thou g The Monkeys excuse to her Husb the abused Cavaleer. Good Cavaleer, if that I have offe Pardon my fault which cannot now be For in my chamber, or else in my bed Ile keep close till my grief be s And know your M. now her fault doth And in a white smock she will penance Little Sir Roger never more shall be In my bookes, nor attain the st dog Of favour, then good Cavaleer be fr With you poor M. als well that wel FINIS.
