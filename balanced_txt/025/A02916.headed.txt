TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, and vertuous Ladie, the La∣die ANNE, Coun∣tesse of OXENFORD: much honour, with in∣crease of godlinesse and vertue. ⁂ ALL THE gouernement, (Right Ho∣norable) of the true, holie, and Catholike Church, which hath ben from the creation of the world, vntil this present age is comprehen∣ded in fiue or∣ders or degrees: the first of the Fathers, beginning at Adam, &c: the second of the Patriarches, beginning at Abraham: the third of the Prophets, beginning at Samuel: the fourth of the high Priests, begin∣ning at Iehoshua, otherwise called Iesus: the fift and
last of the Apostles, beginning at Saint Iohn Baptist. Among all which Apostles, none was more won∣derfullie called to the preaching of the Gospell, than S. Paule, who being a bold & common blasphemer, a bloudie and mercilesse persecuter, afflicting the flocke of Christ with most terrible torments, was notwithstanding euen in the fire of his furie reclai∣med, and became the great teacher of the Gentiles, deliuering vnto them such heauenlie doctrine, as he receiued by diuine inspiration, apt to instruct, exhort, rebuke, correct, and reforme, that the man of God might be made perfect in all good workes. This Apostle, as before the time of his conuersi∣on, which was in the verie yeare of Christs ascensi∣on, he shed much innocent bloud, making hauocke of the members of the Church, with the sword of persecution: so after the renouncing of his apostati∣call tyrannie, he saued manie thousand soules, by the preaching of the Gospell, & word of reconciliation. For he taught the truth of the eternall God, whose minister and vessell of election he was, ordeined to set forth his glorie before the face of the mightie, in∣stantlie, in season and out of season, by the space of thirtie sixe yeares, to manie nations, profoundlie and zealouslie, beginning in the nineteenth yeare of Ti∣berius at Damasco: continuing it through out a great part of the world, as appeareth by his painfull pere∣grination: and finishing that good worke of his, in the thirteenth yeare of Nero, whose prisoner he was, and at his commandement put to death in Rome, for the testimonie of the truth, which he sealed with the losse of his life, vnto the glorie of the great God. This blessed Apostle Saint Paule, was foun∣der
of the Church of Christ at Ephesus, where he preached the Gospell of peace most sincerelie: and instructed the Ephesians in the necessarie doctrines of their saluation, and in the deepe points of true re∣ligion: as in predestination and election, in faith and iustification, in praier and inuocation, in grace and a∣doption, in manners and conuersation, &c. as doth manifestlie appeare in his Epistle, written to this peo∣ple out of bonds and imprisonment. The exposition wherof (Right Honorable) M. Ni∣cholas Hemming, a learned, godlie, & excellent Di∣uine vndertaking, & accomplishing, hath so orderlie & plainlie opened al the principal points therin con∣teined, that nothing can seeme doubtfull or difficult, no not to the simple and ignorant: besides that, so briefelie, that the memorie of the reader shall be a∣ble to carrie awaie both his method and matter. Whose worke when I had read and perused, I tur∣ned familiarlie into our English tong, because I sawe it was a booke verie like to be beneficiall vnto euerie priuate person. And hauing ended mine honest tra∣uell, I remembred (among diuers fauourers of lear∣ning, and louers of godlinesse) your good Ladiship: whom as I honor for the same respects, so finding in your Ladiship, among your other vertues, a zealous loue to religion, and to the sincere seruing of GOD, (rare things in the multitude, what then in the hono∣rable?) I haue bene thereby induced, and thus bold∣lie haue presumed, to prease with this my poore pre∣sent vnto your Ladiship, in waie of dedication: and doe praie your fauourable protection of the same. Beseeching, euen with humblenesse, that this my homelie handeled Expositor, a straunger borne, and
newlie araied with course English cloth, maie finde such fauour in your Ladiships presence, as to be in∣terteined. Not doubting, but the Author for his excellent learning, and profound knowledge vttered therein, shall thereby be able to withstand all seditious Scis∣matikes, quarelling Sycophants, impudent Papists, pestilent Pellagians, blasphemous Anabaptists, licen∣tious Libertines, whose perillous opinions are by him confuted: and finallie, all the malicious members of Sathan that old serpents synagogue: to the preferring of the truth, and the increase of Gods glorie, vnto whose protection I com∣mend your good Ladiship: whose hap∣pinesse God graunt maie be such, both heere and aboue, as your owne heart would wish, and as my continuall and dai∣lie praier shalbe, Amen. Your Honourable Ladiships Most humblie to be commanded, Abraham Fleming.
TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, LEAR∣ned, godlie, and excellent Diuine, M. Henrie of Hertoghenbosch, of the auncient house of the Bruchoffens, Deane of the Chapter of Lunden in Den∣marke, and his beloued brother in Christ, NICHOLAS HEMMING wisheth health and welfare. I Heard (Right Worshipfull) vp∣on a time, at the mouth of that good and godlie man, M. Philip Melancthon, that There is no worke more excellent, than to teach & learne the word of God. And it maie bée so verie well. For, without heauenlie doc∣trine,Ephe. 4. 17. 18. wée proll in most thicke darknesse and ignorance: or (to vse S. Paules speach) We walke in the vanitie of our minde, we wander through our owne blinde vnderstanding, and are farre off from the life of God: because our ignorance, and the hardnesse of our heart bringeth to passe,2. Cor. 7. 10. that we are touched with no féeling at all of sorowe for our sinnes: without which fée∣ling, the voice of the Gospell doth neuer waxe swéete vnto man: but rather lie wide open, and giue vp our selues, to the committing of all filthinesse. Now, the word of God is a souereigne salue to heale vp these sores: when the same is sincerelie taught, and faith∣fullie learned. Which thing that kinglie Prophet Dauid knowing well inough,Psa. 119. 9. witnesseth, saieng: In quo mun∣dam, &c. Wherewith shall a young man redresse his waie? In taking heede thereto according to thy word: which word (doubtlesse) he saith in the same Psalme,Psa. 119. 24. is his delight and counsellers. For this cause the same Prophet,Psa. 119. 127. preferreth that verie word, before all the riches of the world, saieng: Diligo mandata, &c. I loue thy commandements aboue gold: yea, aboue most
fine gold.Psa. 119. 162. Againe, Laetabor ego super, &c. I will reioice at thy words,Psa. 119. 72. as one that findeth a great spoile. Againe, Meli∣or mihi lex, &c. The lawe of thy mouth is better vnto me, than thousands of gold and siluer. Dauid therefore confesseth, that the word of God, is the most pretious treasure in the world: and that our life is vncleane, and our waie filthie, vntill they be cleansed by the word of God, as with water of the clearest fountaine. Which thing is then done, when we obtaine faith by hea∣ring, and receiue the holie Ghost. For, then the mistinesse of our mindes is driuen awaie, our vnderstanding is ligh∣tened, and our heart which was hard before like a stone, is made fleshie and soft: so that the lawe of God maie bée written therein, euen to be touched with the féeling of sin, to defie and spit at sinne, and to followe the counsels, not of the flesh, but of the spirit, in framing and ordering our life. Séeing the doctrine of Gods word bringeth so manie and great benefites, that notable man (whom euen now I named) saith, euen vpon iust cause, that Among all the workes of men, to teach and learne the word of God is the most excellent. Now, forsomuch as the word of God is a treasure so pre∣tions, & to teach and learne the word of God, a worke so excellent, what shall we saie of the sincere & true teachers of this word? What shall we saie of them, which deliuered the word of God, as it were from destruction, when it laie ouertroden with the horrible imaginations of men, and deuises of diuels, as in most filthie mire, and made the same faire and cleane with their sound and sincere exposi∣tions? We are greatlie indebted to them, which sée to the prouision of such necessaries as belong to the maintenance of this life, and without which these fraile bodies of ours cannot continue in health: but we are neuer able to re∣quite them with the like, which haue restored and made doctrine pure againe, béeing the verie treasure, without the which we fall from all hope of euerlasting life, and
haue deliuered the same doctrine vnto vs, both by word of mouth, and in writing, sound and sincere. In the number of these I reckon M. Philip Melan∣cthon,M. Philip Melan∣cthon commen∣ded. our schoolemaster, a man worthie of the first place next vnder M. Martine Luther: than whom all Germa∣nie neuer bred and brought vp one sharper in wit, quic∣ker in iudgement, perfecter in knowledge, greater in learning, readier & sounder in expounding the scripture roundlie: yea, & more than that, zealouser in godlinesse, and earnester in religion▪ In consideration of which no∣table and singular gifts, he is had in great account and estimation, not onelie of them which professe the same re∣ligion with vs: but also of the verie enimies of true re∣ligion. When Saint Paule wrote to the Philippians of his time,Phi. 2. 29. concerning Epaphroditus, saieng: Excipite ipsum in domino, & Receiue him in the Lord, with all glad∣nesse, and make much of such: the holie Ghost meaneth indéed thereby: yea, willeth vs, to take them for Gods instruments: openlie to confesse the benefits which wée receiue by the meanes of such men, to be of God: to re∣uerence them as our schoolemasters: to loue them as our fathers: to estéeme of them as the builders vp of Gods Church: and to make accompt of them as the most principall pillers of Gods Temple. Thus much doeth godlinesse desire: and their trauels deserue no lesse. We must not therefore giue them anie place, whose practise it is to deuise slauders, reproches, and foule spea∣ches, thereby doing what they can, to put out so great lights of the Church: who, if they séems to haue done a∣misse in anie thing, let vs make the best of it, for Christi∣an charitie, and méeknesse sake. It is a true saieng of Xenophon: . Which sound thus béeing expounded: It is a hard matter for men so to do a thing,
that it be amisse in no point: and it is hard for them also that do a thing in no respect blame-worthy, not to light vpō some quareling findfault. For the weaknes of men is great, and manie escapes are made in a mans life, which are rather friendlie & fauourablie to be couered, than maliciouslie and enuiouslie to be made worse. There is also in manie a great lightnesse, which ma∣keth men to be sharper iudges against others, that haue not offended at all. As for our weaknesse, let vs lament it: and as for our lightnesse, (which is the cause that they are euill thought of, whose labours are greater, and their gifts excellenter,) let vs leaue it: giuing God thankes, who sendeth into his Church, for the edificati∣on or building vp thereof, such healthfull instruments. And although verie great thankes (as méete is) are due to them, which haue found out & made redie the first waie: yet notwithstanding, others that haue followed after in their place, and trie all the masteries they maie, for the edification or building vp of the Church, and the knitting together of the Saints, are not to bée sette at naught: but euerie one in his place is to be had in ac∣compt.Acts. 18. 3 & 20. 34 Saint Paule was a worthie and chosen instru∣ment of God, than whom not one of the Apostles labou∣red more,2. Cor. 11. 22. 23. 24, &c. nor spread the Gospell of Christ further. Ti∣tus also, who remained in the Isle of Crete, was lesser than Saint Paule,1. Thes. 2. 9. 10. both in giftes and labours: and also in degrée of calling. Héere I acknowledge and giue Saint Paule his title,Tit. 1. 5. to be the great teacher of the Gentiles: and as for Titus, I reuerence him accor∣ding to his place, who learned at S. Paules mouth those things, which afterwards he deliuered to his hea∣rers. In like sort, I acknowledge and reuerence M. Mar∣tine Luther, & M. Philip Melancthon, as the principall and chiefest teachers that euer Gods Church had in our age: the like I doe also to all, and euerie one of them in
their place, as the healthfull instruments of God in his Church: by whose workes I set great store, & am also right glad, that it was my lucke to be of their number, which acknowledge & reuerence M. Mart. Luther, &. M. Philip Melancthon, their schoolemaisters For, out of the riuers, which they fetcht from the fountaines of Israel, I confesse my selfe to haue drawne that which I set abroch, and teach in this Vniuersitie of Coppenhagen, as a mi∣nister of the Gospell of God, and according to the order of my calling. I despise no man, I thinke not better of mine owne opinions than of other mens iudgements: but I yeeld and submit my selfe to the Catholike Church of God, as my iudge: which Church I dere to be, not the Fathers and Mothers of Neptune counsell: but those that iboare Augusta confession: that is to saie, all such as holde the Creeds sound & vncorrupt: in what place so euer they be scattered. I condemne no man, if he disagree from mee: so that he ouerthrowe not the foundation: that is to saie, the Créeds. I acknowledge the weaknesse of vs all, which I both be∣waile,Psal. 127. 1. & beséech God to set to his owne hand to the buil∣ding. Nisi enim Dominus, &c. For except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it. I allow euerie ones endeuour, that bestowe anie paines at all to∣ward the building of Gods Church: in whose number, although I graunt my selfe to be the verie least: yet not∣withstanding, I am of this minde,Mat. 25. 14, &c. that the talent which God hath giuen me, must not lie hid vnoccupied. And because it is not my séeking, to serue the hearers present onelie, but those that are absent also: yea, the whole Church of Christ, I haue put some of mine owne writings to the presse, caused them to bée printed, & sent them abroad. With like aduisement also, I haue pub∣lished these my notes vpon the Epistle of S. Paule to the Ephesians: beeing willing to haue them come abroad
vnder your name (Right worshipfull:) that some token of my thankfulnesse to you wards maie be séene, whom it hath pleased, not onelie to stand my good & sincere friend, all the time that you tarried in this realme: but also to vouchsafe the bestowing of verie manie benefits vpon me: as for those great benefits & good deeds, which you haue done to our Vniuersitie, & to euerie student of the same, I let them passe vnspoken. For I know, your wor∣ship is of their number, which had rather do good, (God beholding it,) than to be praised of men, and to hunt after vaine glorie at their mouth. For they that doe so,Mat. 6. 1. 2 , receiue their reward. For they are hirelings which serue for hire, and not the children of God, which doe God seruice of their owne accord. Well maie your worship fare, and I praie you take in good part the gift that I send, fauourablie iudgeing of the same, according to your manner: and if anie thing mis∣like you, let me haue vnderstanding thereof. For your iudgement ruleth me much. Once againe I wish you well to fare, with that right honest Gentlewoman, mi∣stresse Anne your wife, who (as I heare saie) hath in∣creased your houshold with a yong babe. God grant that it maie turne to his glorie, and to yours, and the mothers ioie and comfort. I praie you haue me commended to M. Tyco your Bishop, M. Vessele your Chaunter, M. Balthasar your Archdeacon, M. Magnus your di∣uinitie reader, M. Iohn Spandemager, who hath taken great paines, these thirtie yeares and more in the Lords vineyard: and all my other brethren, my fellowe labou∣rers. From Coppenhagen, these Calends of Nouember. 1564.

¶The Argument vpon the Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paule to the Ephesians. THat we may the more fully perceiue and vnderstand the argument of this most ho∣ly Epistle, written to the Ephesians, out of the prison at Rome: wée must make declaration of those foure points, which I am wont to touch in the beginning of mine expositions vpon the holy Scriptures. The foure pointes are these. First, Who was the Author of this Epistle. For to knowe this, maketh very much for the winning of wor∣thinesse, and authoritie to this Epistle. Secondly, What was the occasion why the same was written. For the marking héereof, maketh very much, both to vnderstand the perfect discourse of the whole mat∣ter, and also to declare the order of the questions. Thirdly, What is the state or principall question, whereby the kinde of the cause is knowne: & the ende or scope of him which speaketh is vnderstoode. Fourthly, What is the order of handling: which being not vnderstoode, the weight & importaunce of things can∣not be obserued. To conclude, it often times falleth out, that the methode or manner of speaking béeing not mar∣ked, circumstances contrarie & beside the meaning of the writer, are heaped vp together, and many things are wre∣sted of heretikes, for the confirmation of their wicked & erronious opinions: as is to be sene in their writings, who in iudging, vse not the rule of Logicke: but handle all and euery seuerall part or parcell, as it were members plucked off from the bodie. Of these foure points therfore we will orderly intreat, to the intent that we may the more easily attaine to the
vnderstanding of this diuine Epistle. Of the first. THe Authour of this Epistle is the Apostle Paule, that great Doctor or teacher of the Gentiles: who, as he was called to the office and ministerie of an Apostle, by the reuelation of Iesus Christ, so was he instructed and taught the mysterie of saluation, by the same Iesus Christ. This Apostle, like a valiaunt souldier of Christ, being adorned and deckt with souldierlike ensignes and armes of the field, to wit, with sundry sorts of tribulati∣ons and persecutions,2. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. with whippings, stonings, buffe∣tings, reuilings, &c. by the space of fiue and thirtie yeres almost, wrote this Epistle in Prison at Rome to ye Ephe∣sians, drawing to an end of his life. Forsomuch therefore as the Authour of this Epistle, is a man of such accompt, it is not lawfull to call in doubt, either the weightinesse of the matter, or the authoritie of the writer. Wherfore, whatsoeuer things are deliuered vnto vs in this Epistle, we ought no lesse to reuerence and consider, than the ve∣rie things themselues, which God by his owne mouth hath vttered and spoken from Heauen. And therefore, as the doctrine conteined in this Epistle, is : that is to say, by inspiration from God: so hath it verie great weight & force to confirme the articles of our religion, and to confute errours, and that in such sort, as that no man, vnlesse he be altogether godlesse, and a pro∣fessed or sworne enimie to Christ, will set himselfe a∣gainst the worthinesse and authoritie of this most holie Epistle. Many more things, touching this our Apostle, may be read in the Actes of the Apostles, & in his owne Epistles to the Galathians, the Corinthians, and others. Of the second. AN offence taken at the crosse, ministred an occasion to the Apostle, of writing this Epistle. For at such
time as Paule, hauing finished his course of preaching, was cast into prison at Rome, and that the godlie eue∣rie where were afflicted, not onely by Tyrants, but also of false Apostles: he thought it a part of his charge and calling, to confirme the Ephesians, by writing to them, whom bicause of his absence, he could not teach: least that, either for his owne crosse, or for the persecutions of the Church, which at that time were excéeding great, they should fall from that grace, wherof they were made par∣takers by the preaching of the Gospell. As therefore the offence of the crosse, moued this most holie Apostle of Christ to write: so the ende of his writing was, to arme the Ephesians, that they might inuincibly stand, & persist in that doctrine of Christ, which they had learned of him. Of the third. BEcause the speciall part of this Epistle consisteth in exposition, the full scope thereof doth lesse shew it selfe, than if it were reasoned and disputed vpon: which not∣withstanding shall easilie be atteined, when the ende of his writing is perceiued. Out of the first, second & third Chapters therefore is this principall scope or summe ga∣thered: namelie, That the doctrine concerning the grace of God, and his mercie through Iesus Christ, is no new∣lie vpstart doctrine, neither belongeth to one sort or sect of men onelie: but that the same, euen from before the world was created, vntill this day, was in such order stablished by God himselfe, yt so manie should be saued in Christ, as beléeued in him,Rom. 1. 16 not onelie Iewes, but also Gentiles, among whom were the Ephesians. This scope or summe is declared in a large exposition, & trimlie set out or deckt with weightie words and sentences: and this is done in the thrée first Chapters. Héereby most euidentlie apeareth, how necessarie the doctrine is, which is deliuered in this Epistle. In the thrée last Chapters, diuers exhortations are interlaced, and duties also, as well common to all e∣states, as peculiar to some, are commended to the godlie.
Of the fourth. THe occasion, the full scope or summe, and the ende, why this Epistle was written, béeing knowne, the order or method of handling the same, may the more ea∣sily be declared, and also vnderstoode. There are (besides the title, the gréeting, and the knitting vp or farewell of this Epistle) two principall parts, namely, , and , that is to say, Doctrine and Exhortation: wherof doctrine is by nature the first, & exhortation the se∣cond by order. For this is the perpetual order of Moses, of the Prophets, of Christ, of the Apostles, and of all such as teach aright: that vpon doctrine, which they deliuer in the first place, they frame & bring in their admonitions, their exhortations, their comminations or threatenings, their reprehensions or rebukings, their consolations, &c. For so doe they applie their doctrine to the hearers. And surely, a small matter it is to teach well, except therwithall thou stirre vp the slouthfull with certeine pricks, except thou refresh and comfort the fearefull, except thou rebuke and chide the stubburne and wilfull, &c. Furthermore, the former part, which is called , Doctrine, is not : that is to say, standeth not vpon disputation or reasoning: but , that is to say, consists in expositiō. For it conteineth an expositi∣on of the mysterie of our saluation, & that first in generall, towardes all the elect or chosen, declaring, that it is not a new mysterie of saluation, but in such sort ordeined and established, before the creation of the world, by the méere goodnesse of our heauenly Father, that he would saue all beléeuers, in his beloued sonne. Then he diuideth the generalitie, & applieth the same to the specialties: shew∣ing, That the benefit of reconciliation or attonement, doth indifferently belong to the Iewes and to the Gentiles, among whom were the Ephesians. And as Rhetoricians teach, what is to be obserued in the exposition of things,
so he beateth in more déeply the causes & the circumstan∣ces. For he setteth downe most diligently, the causes ef∣ficient, materiall, formall and finall of this mysterie, ma∣king a repetition of the selfe same things yet againe, both that a desire of this so great a mysterie, might be kind∣led the more in the mindes of the Ephesians: & also that they might not (for any causes whatsoeuer) fall from so great grace. Héerevpon also it ariseth, that he saith, he gi∣ueth God thankes, for that he hath vouchsafed to reueale his mysterie of the saluation of mankinde, to the Ephesi∣ans: & that he witnesseth likewise, that he praide vnto God for the Ephesians, that they might profit daily more and more, in the knowledge of this mysterie. Now, that he might persuade the Ephesians, that sal∣uation fréely giuen, doth also pertaine to them, he shew∣eth how he himselfe was called and taught, by the reue∣lation of Iesus Christ, to preach the Gospell or glad ti∣dings of saluation freely giuen, not to the Iewes onely but to the Gentiles also, the difference betwéene the Iewes and the Gentiles being taken away by the cōming of Christ: so that saluation fréely giuen, is indifferently, and with∣out respect, offered to the Gentiles, and to the Iewes: faith béeing the instrument whereby it is receiued. Hitherto haue we touched the former part of this E∣pistle, which he knitteth vp and endeth with a thanksgi∣uing, according to his vsuall manner. Héere let the Readers diligently marke, how fitly all things are applied to the scope and ende of his wri∣ting. If grace be powred out so plentifully vpon all men: if the mysterie of saluation decréed, and purposed before the creation of the world, be preached: if in his be∣loued sonne he loueth the beléeuers: if he seale saluation & grace by his spirit: if he sende Apostles and Am∣bassadours with grace of this mysterie: if it bée a gift and benefit fréely giuen: if by the preaching of this benefit the praise and glorie of God is testified: to be short, if the
holinesse and saluation of men be sought: what man or woman, vnlesse they be wodde & witlesse, contemners and despisers of their owne saluation, but will confesse that it is meruellous necessarie to stand sledfastly in this doc∣trine, & with a valiant & inuincible minde and courage, to suffer rather any torments, than to fall from so great grace and saluation. The latter part which standeth vpon exhortation, is diuerse & manifolde. For in this the Apostle exhorteth first of all to the vnitie of spirit in loue & charitie: then he goeth to common dueties, as it were to ye specialties of the generalitie. Then, by reasons repugnant & contrarie to our vocation or calling, he weaneth and withdraweth vs from vices, and declareth (by comparison) what the godly ought to do. Heerevnto he addeth precepts con∣cerning domesticall discipline, or household gouernment. For he inioineth husbands & wiues, parents & children, maisters and seruaunts,  officia si∣b inuicem reddere, that is to say, to vse semblaunt and proportionable duties one towards and other: all which he draweth out of the fountaine of faith & loue, applieng to each seuerally that which to them is conuenient. After this he maketh vp the panoplie or warlike furniture of Christian souldiers, and therwithall he armeth the Ephe∣sians, against Sathan the enimie of mans saluation: vnto this part be ioineth are quest, that the Ephesians would pray for him. Lastly, he maketh mention of Tychicus, whom he sent vnto them with this Epistle, of whom (as he certifieth them) they might know his estate: & so at the length, with a well wishing vnto them, according to his custome, he maketh en ende. Let this be sufficient to be spoken of the order and method of handling this Epistle. Now, in the explication or expounding of euery seuerall Chapter. I will (after my manner) kéepe this order. First, I will gather & drawe euery seuerall Chapter to a cer∣taine summarie or head Secondly, & will set downe the
order and parts of euery seuerall Chapter. Thirdly and lastly, I will adde an exposition, & an obseruation of such doctrines as we shall méete, with an applieng of them to our vse and practise. The first bringeth this benefit, that whatsoeuer is Rhetorically spoken, the same béeing examined summarily by Logick, may the more easily bée vnderstood, and in few words or short speach once concei∣ued, may sticke the faster in memorie. The second, which is the middlemost, doth helpe as well the interpreter or teacher, as also ye learners or scholers. It helpeth the inter∣preter or teacher, least he, forgetting those things wherof speciall consideration should be had, might breake out in∣to straieng opinions, nothing belonging to the Authors meaning: which thing in sequele ingendreth many corrup¦tions, diuersitie of opinions, vnprofitable disputations, sects & heresies. It helpeth ye learners or scholers, bicause they (besids obseruation & marking of the order, than the which nothing is more handsome & commendable) ma the more narrowly sée into ye pith & substance of things whereby iudgment is formed in the learners, to the end yt they in other writings may obserue & marke the phrase and manner of speach. The last examineth the order of things, bringeth light to that which is hidden & darke, vn∣tieth yt which is intangled & snarled, & sheweth the vse of those things, which are declared in our life: by which meanes it commeth to passe (as the Apostle saith) that out of the Scriptures we draw knowledge, comfort, patience, and hope. THE FIRST CHAPTER. The summe of the first Chapter. AS God reuealeth ye misterie of saluation by his gospel vnto them, whō (according to his good wil & pleasure) he hath chosen in his beloued sonne, for the praise of his glorie: so he sealeth them with his spirit: & Paule testifi∣eth yt the Ephesians are in ye number. Wherfore he giueth
God thankes for them, and praieth that they might more and more abound. The order and partes of the Chapter. THe order of the Chapter is this. After the inscription or title, & the desire or wish, followeth in the first place a thanksgiuing, a reason béeing taken from the manifolde blessing & grace of God, most liberally powred foorth vp∣on all mankinde. Héerevnto is added a notable exposi∣tion of this grace of God towards all mankinde, and that altogether Rhetoricall. For first of all he setteth out and commendeth this grace of God towardes mankinde: and by reasons drawn from the Causes and Effects he ampli∣fieth and inlargeth it. Then he goeth from the generali∣tie vnto two specialities: and this partaking of grace hée applieth first to the Iewes, and secondly to the Gentiles, but vnder the name of the Ephesians. Moreouer, to the ende that the Ephesians might acknowledge the great∣nesse of this grace, and thinke vpon perseueraunce or con∣stancie, he saith that he giueth God thankes for reuealing vnto them the mysterie of saluation, and that he praieth vnto God, that they may increase & abound therein more and more. From whence he falleth againe into the setting foorth and commending of Gods benefits. ¶The exposition of the first Chapter, with the obserua∣tion of doctrines therein contained. 1. Verse. PAVLE an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God, to the Saintes which are at E∣phesus, and to the faithfull in Christ Iesus. PAVLE an Apostle of Iesus Christ by the will of God. To the Saintes which are at Ephesus, and to them which beleeue in Ie∣sus Christ. THere are two partes of this inscripti∣on or title, the first whereof containeth thrée things, to wit. The proper name of the person which writeth. The wor∣thinesse of his office, and the authoritie of his function Apostolicall. Héerevpon
we may gather first of all, what accompt is to be made of the doctrine of the Apostle, who was made an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the will of God. Secondly, we may learne heereby in generall, not onely what the authoritie of Ministers is, which bring Paules doctrine: but also what manner confession of their function and calling is required. Wée must conclude vpon both, that we must not giue place to assemblies of men sitting in councell, or to the authoritie of any man or men, if they commaund or bring in any thing contrarie or against this doctrine of the Apostle. For it is not méete that the authoritie and vioce of God should giue place to the traditions, or to the superioritie of men or diuels. To this agréeth that saieng of Saint Paule to the Galathians. If an Angel from Heauen preach otherwise than we haue preached, let him be accursed. The second part of the inscription or title, doth not one∣ly name them, vnto whome the Apostle writeth, to wit, the Ephesians: but also adorneth and beautifieth them with most excellent titles, whilst it calleth them by the name of Saintes and Faithfull. Which two names are so ioint∣ly linked together by nature, that of whome so euer the one is spoken, the other also is most truely meant and vt∣tered. For they cannot be separated either from other: bicause, who so euer is faithfull is a Saint: and who so euer is a Saint is faithfull. Whosoeuer beléeueth truly is holie: and againe, euery one that is holie doth be∣léeue. Now, we are made Saints, or holie by this meanes. The faith of the Gospel doth separate vs from the vnholi∣nesse of the world, & bringeth vs vnto ye familie or house∣holde of God: by this selfe same faith we are purified and made cleane. For whosoeuer beléeueth in Christ, is both purged and also healed by his bloud. Furthermore, by this selfe same faith we are presented before God, that we might be a liuelie sacrifice, pleasing God thorough Iesus
Christ. Whosoeuer therefore is separated from the vn∣holinesse of the world, is purified by the bloud of Christ, & is slaine to be a liuely sacrifice vnto God, through Iesus Christ, the same is a Saint & holie in déede, notwithstan∣ding he perceiue in himselfe certaine spottes and blemi∣shes, which he doth what he can to wash away & auoide. This place doth shew, as well what things are ioi∣ned to a true faith: as also that the faithfull is reputed a Saint or holie one before God, euen by the iudgement of the holie Ghost. The wordes of Chrysostome in this place are excellent. Loe (saith he) Saint Paule calleth such men Saintes, as had wiues, children, and an householde. For afterwards followeth the proper termes whereby he termeth them, to wit, Husbands, wiues, maisters and seruaunts, and to them he commendeth mutuall dueties. By this terming of them Saints therfore, ye pestilent er∣rour of Monks is confuted, who put sanctitie or holines in single life, and in fained or dissembled virginitie. Vnto these also I adde, that they likewise are confuted by this place, who bragged and boasted of a precise choice of po∣uertie, as of the perfection & fulnes of Christian holines. For among the Ephesians, were many saithfull per∣sons, which did abound in riches & wealth: yet they, not∣withstanding their conuersion by the preaching of Paule, cast not away their riches, or set their substaunce at naught. 2. Verse. Grace be vvith you, & peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ. Grace bee with you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ. THis desire or well wishing of the Apostle, comprehen∣deth a summarie of the benefits of the Gospell. First he wisheth vnto the Ephesians Gods grace: which signi∣fieth vnto vs, as well the free good will of God, as also euerie gift whatsoeuer is giuen vs of God. Secondly hée wisheth peace vnto them, that is to say, reconciliation or
attonement of our selues with God: he wisheth likewise vnto them such things as are ioined with this reconci∣liation: namely, the ioy of spirit, and a quiet conscience. Now, from whence this grace and peace procéedeth, & by whom we possesse them, the Apostle declareth, when he saith (From God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.) From God the Father, as from the beginning & fountain: & from ye Lord Iesus Christ, as frō ye Mediatour. For as the Father is the fountaine of all graces: so the sonne is both the matter & merit of all grace & peace. Héere therefore, euen in the verie enterance of this Epistle, all merits of men, and all dreames of Monks, touching their traditiōs, all their Merita congrui, digni & condig: that is, of congruitie & worthinesse, &c. are put to silence. For so often as grace is preached so often are the merits of men ouerthrowne and condemned. For how can that be of merit, which is of grace? For that saieng of the holie Ghost standeth vnremouable, Si ex gratia, non ampliùs ex operibus:Rom. 11. 6 alioqui gratia non est gratia, &c. If it be of grace, it is no more of works, or else were grace no more grace. But if it be of works, it is no more grace, or else were worke no more worke. The Apostle, in this place doth so oppose and set grace and worke one against the other, that both of them can by no meanes be attributed to one selfe same third thing, neither yet the one ascribed to the other. Moreouer, this well wishing doth teach vs, that we can obtaine no good thing at Gods hand, but that which procéedeth from God, by and through our Lorde Iesus Christ. Saint Paule therefore sendeth vs to the Well head of all goodnesse, and there withall requireth faith, which is the bucket, whereby wee drawe all good∣nesse out of this Well head. For as the foundation of this grace and peace, is the good will of God, and his fa∣therly loue, in hauing compassion of man: so man is the marke or ende wherevnto this foundation is referred,
but yet by faith. For faith is the instrument, whereby this grace and reconciliation offered vnto vs, is receiued, and possessed. 3. Verse. Blessed be God, euen the father of our Lord Iesus Christ. Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. THe apostle beginneth with thanksgiuing: which tendeth héerevnto, euen to admonish vs of our duetie. For it is not conuenient, that we should lightly passe ouer and let slip any grace of God, without praising & magnifieng his name for the same. The word (Blessing) which Saint Paul vseth in this place hath not a simple signification, but varieth in consi∣deration of that wherevnto it is applied: for God bles∣seth man, man blesseth God, and man blesseth man: how∣beit diuerse and differing waies. When God is said to blesse man, ye meaning is, That God in speaking the word, prospereth and dealeth well with him. For the worde of God is his worke: and what he saith, is done. Man is said to blesse God, when with a true faith he praiseth & glori∣fieth God for his benefits, through Iesus Christ, and that with the heart, & outward confession of the mouth. That this is so, it is euident: bicause the Scripture vseth these wordes, , and  (well wishing, and bles∣sing) indifferently, the one for the other. Man is said to blesse man, when he wisheth him prosperitie, and prai∣eth that all things may goe well with him. Furthermore, the priestlie blessing is not to be suppo∣sed the blessing of man onely, but rather of God: in which blessing the commaundement & the promise is to be mar∣ked. The commaundement is this: Benedicetis, &c. (Thus shall you blesse the children of Israel (saith the Lord) & say vnto them:Num. 6. 23 The Lord blesse thee and keepe thee, The Lord make his face shine vpon thee, & be mercifull vnto thee, The Lord lift vp his countenaunce vpon thee, and
giue thee peace.) The promise is this: Inuocabunt Sacer∣dotes, &c. The Priests shall put my name vpon the chil∣dren of Israel, and I will blesse them.) This promise is to be receiued by faith, and it staieth vpon the merite of Christ, in whome all the promises of God are, yea, and Amen. 3. Verse. Who hath blessed vs vvith all spirituall blessing, in heauenly things in Christ. VVhich hath blessed vs with all manner of spirituall blessing in heauenly things by Christ. THis is the reason of his thanksgiuing, wherein hee comprehendeth very great things in singular shortnes. For first of all he setteth foorth the fountaine and Author of all blessing, that is to say, of all prosperitie: namely, God the Father, who of his fatherly good will blesseth vs. Secondly, he giueth vs a sight of the obiect: to wit, man, v∣pon whom God hath powred his blessing most liberally. Thirdly, he declareth the peculiar blessing, which is hand∣led in this place, to be spirituall grace, whereby wée are adopted, and made heires of euerlasting life. Fourthly, he sheweth that this peculiar and excellent blessing is not to be sought for in the worlde, but in heauen: and that it is begun first heere, but there ended and made perfect. Fiftly and lastly, he addeth the matter of this spirituall blessing. For Christ is the matter and merite of the same. Marke how many and how heauenly things the Apo∣stle knitteth vp in a very few words. As the first and the second point teach vs, that God is the Fountaine of all good: so they beate downe and kéepe vnder all arrogancie, and pride of man. The third point teacheth vs, that the benefits of the Gospel are spiritual. The fourth sendeth vs to heauen by faith, where the treasure of all blessing is laid vp in Christ. The fift and last ouerthroweth mightily all merites of men. For the merit of this heauenlie blessing is in none other, but in Christ alone.
4. Verse. As he hath chosen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, that vve should be holie & vvithout blame before him. According as he hath chosen vs in him before the creation of the world, that we should be Saints & vnreproueable before him in loue. THis is a reason of that which the Apostle said be∣fore. For as in the last verse he set downe a rea∣son, why we are bound by dutie, to extoll the goodnesse of God: to wit, because he hath most liberallie powred his spirituall blessing vpon vs, whereby he hath blessed vs in Christ: so héere is annered a reason of that reason, by exposition. Wherein, as he comprehendeth the foun∣dation and matter of that heauenlie grace or spirituall blessing: so likewise he shutteth vp, as it were in a verie briefe Aphorisme, the time and last ende of the same: to the intent that this mysterie might the more manifestlie appeare before our eies. The foundation of our spirituall blessing, or heauenlie grace, or of our saluation, the Apostle maketh Gods eter∣nall election, whereby he vouchsafed to choose such as should beléeue in him, before the creation of the world. The matter thereof is Christ. For in him onelie hea∣uenlie grace doth rest: yea, our life & saluation is in him. Héere we must take verie great héede, that we separate not election from his proper matter. For we must not dreame of anie election without Christ. God hath not cho∣sen vs simplie, but in Christ, that is to say, as members of Christ, knit by faith vnto Christ our head. He saith that this election in Christ, was therefore wrought before the world was made: least the Ephesians should thinke, that this Gospell or doctrine of obteining saluation by Christ, was preached by Paule at happe hazard or aduentures, as a doctrine but latelie hatcht: but that they might ra∣ther know, that it was the eternall counsell or purpose of God, to giue saluation to all that beléeue in Christ. The last ende of this heauenlie blessing is added, to wit, (That we should be holie, & without blame before
him in loue,) which is the fountaine of all other christian duties. This high and excellent calling therefore doeth require holinesse and innocencie of life, as the last end or effect of spirituall blessing. Thus far we haue shewed the meaning of ye Apostle, now let vs see what doctrine & comfort is to be gotten therby. First therefore, where he saith, that (We are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world) we may ther∣vpon, as vpon an vnmoueable principle, conclude these specialties: to wit, That our election is frée, that it is without vs, that election is not to be sought in the matter of man, that election is firme & ratified, that our saluati∣on is founded in Christ alone, that all merits of men are excluded, that they are called elect or chosen, which are in Christ by faith: for the principle of our saluation stan∣deth stedfast, He that beleeueth in the sonne, shall not perish, but shall haue euerlasting life. For by faith a pas∣sage is made frō eternal election, to glorification to come. Some, out of this place doe reason in this manner, God hath chosen some, in Christ, before the foundation of the world, Ergo God ordeined the fall of man before the foun∣dation of the world. For of them which fell, some are cho∣sen to life, and some are reserued or kept to due condem∣nation. Now séeing it is necessarie, that men stood, before their fall: it followeth, that God ordeined the creation of man in righteousnesse, and holinesse, from the which he fell by sinne. Therefore, the creation of man, his corrup∣tion, his election, & his reprobation are ordeined of God. To this argument I aunswere: That to ordeine and bring to passe is one thing: to foreknow in eternall coun∣sell another. God ordeined the creation of man to his owne Image or likenesse, that he should be righteous and holie: & it was the fatherlie will of God, that his creature shuld continue such a one. He did foreknow yt man shuld fall after Sathan had deceiued him, yet notwithstanding he ordeined not his fall: yea rather, this his fall was
contrarie to Gods ordinaunce, els had it not bene deadly vnto man. But in so much as God foreknew mans dis∣case, he ordeined a remedie, to wit, his election after his fal in Iesus Christ. Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is not the cause of mans fall: but contrariewise, his fall which was to come, was the cause of Gods foreknowledge. For the thing dependeth not vpon knowledge, but knowledge vpon the thing. Againe, we haue to vnderstand, that the election of God is eternall, and before all time: so that therein, in re∣spect of time, nothing is to be thought before or after. S. Paule therefore when he saith (That God hath chosen vs before the foundation of the world) speaketh in respect of vs, who are then in déede said to bée elected, and chosen by Gods eternall decrée, when we beleeue in Christ, and in∣deuour to liue in holinesse and innocencie. Héerevpon it followeth, that the blasphemous speaches of such are execrable & accursed which say: If I am elected and chosen, why then mine iniquitie shall not condemne mée, the counsell of God is vnchaungeable. If I be not e∣lected and chosen, why then neither faith, nor desire to liue vertuously will doe me any good. The manner of election which is conditionall, confuteth these kinde of speaches. We are chosen in Christ, Ergo we are chosen vpon this condition, if we be in Christ: that is, if we shall beleeue in Christ. Wherefore he that is condemned is condemned through his owne default, bicause when he was fallen, he refused to take hold of Gods right hand, whose wil it was to lift him vp againe. This is proued by the ende of the ministerie of the word. For God sent the Apostles, & their successors also abroad to this end, That they shuld preach the Gospel, & that they which beleeued should haue life euerlasting. Our saluation therfore out of doubt is condi∣tional,Col. 1. 13. as these words of Paule beare record, Si modo, &c. If you continue grounded and stablished in the faith. Participes,Heb. 3. 6. &c. We are made partakers of Christ, if we
hold fast the confidence, and the reioicing of the hope vnto the ende.1. Tim. 2. 15. Mulier, &c. The woman shall bee saued, if she continue in faith. Si tamen, &c. If so be we shall be sound cloathed & not naked.2. Cor. 5. 3. Christ in like case bea∣teth into our heads this condition,Ioh. 3. 18. Qui crediderit, &c. He that beleeueth, shall not be condemned: but he that be∣leeueth not,Luke. 13. 5 is condemned alreadie. Nisi, &c. Except yee amend your liues,Ioh. 15. 7. ye shall all likewise perish. Si man∣seritis, &c. If ye abide in me, & my words abide in you, aske what ye will, and it shall be done vnto you. Vpon this simplicitie of Gods word, let vs stedfastlie staie our selues, neither let vs suffer our selues to be withdrawn from it by anie sophistrie: let vs giue to God the praise of truth: and let vs be trulie resolued in our selues, that Gods will is to do that indéed, which he witnesseth in his word he will doe. But if we be not able to aunswere to all the craftie conclusions of Sophisters, which wrest the Scripture di∣uerslie, to mainteine & vphold their decrees of destinie: let vs confesse, that we are but babes in the schoole of Christ, and let vs hold fast the grounds of godlines, which we haue atteined vnto, by an vnfeined faith: neither let these most sweete and delicate saiengs be snatcht from vs,1. Tim. 1. 15. Fidelis sermo, &c. This is a true saieng, and by all meanes worthie to be receiued, that Christ Iesus came in∣to the world to saue sinners.1. Tim. 2. 3 4. 5. 6. Againe, Hoc honestum, &c. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sa∣uiour, who will that all men shall be saued, and come vnto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediatour betweene God and man, which is the man Christ Iesus, who gaue himselfe a raunsome for all men. And the Lord himselfe saith, Venite, &c. Come vnto me,Matth. 9. 13. all ye that labour & are heauie loaden and I will refresh you. And againe, Non veni, &c. I came not into the world to call the righteous,2. Pet. 3. 9 but sinners to repentaunce. Againe, Deus est, &c. The Lord is pati∣ent
towards vs, & would haue no man perish, but would all men to come to repentaunce.Rom. 10. 11. 12. Againe, Omnis, &c. Whosoeuer beleeueth in him, shall not be ashamed: for there is no difference betweene the Iewe and the Gre∣cian: for he that is Lord ouerall, is rich vnto all that call vpon him. Againe, Apparuit, &c. For the grace of God,Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13. which bringeth saluation vnto all men, hath appe∣red: & teacheth vs that we should denie vngodlines, & worldlie lusts, and that we should liue soberlie & righ∣teouslie, and godlie in this present world: looking for the blessed hope & appearing of the glorie of the migh∣tie God, and of our Sauiour Iesus Christ. These and such like saiengs let vs set against all sophistrie, nothing re∣garding the fowle language of sophisters, albeit they mis∣call vs at their pleasure, tearming vs, fooles, dolts, block∣heads, asses, and otherwise as they list. Let Christ alone be our wisedome, who (as we know well inough) hated all sophistrie. 5. 6. & 7. Verses. 5 Who hath predestinate vs, to bee adopted through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his vvil, 6 To the praise of the glorie of his grace, vvhervvith he hath made vs accepted in his belo∣ued, 7 By vvhom vve haue redemp∣tion, through his bloud, euen the forgiuenes of sinnes, accor∣ding to his rich grace. VVho hath predestinate vs vnto the adoption of his chil∣dren, through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, according to the good plesure of his will, to the praise of his glorie & grace, whereby he hath made vs acceptable in the beloued, in whom we haue redemption by his bloud, euen the remission of sinnes, accor∣ding to the riches of his grace. THis is an exposition, or rather a certeine notable, & excellent repetition of the last reason, with greater weight of things & words, & also a noting of circūstances. For in this place ye Apostle fetcheth further, & beateth vpō that, which before he had spoken, heaping vp such things
together, as séemed to make the more for the plaine proofe of the matter. Now, that we may the better drawe out such treasure, as is stored vp in this part, and applie the same to our vse, let vs lay it downe in points, and let vs consider and examine euerie particular member by it selfe seuerallie, and weight them throughlie, and (as they say) to the proofe. Of this part, there are eight members, which thus followe in order. IN the first place he maketh mention, of the verie: foundation or principall cause of our spirituall bles∣sing, that is to say, of our saluation, namelie predestinati∣on: wherby God had a foreknowledge of their saluation (euen before the world was made) which shuld beléeue in Iesus Christ. For as our Lord Iesus Christ alone, is the matter of our election, so is he also of our predestination. In the second place he setteth downe the forme or manner of predestination: to wit, : that is to say, adoption: whereby we are adopted into the sonnes, which were before, through sinne, the sonnes of wrath. This predestinate adoption, is applied vnto vs by faith, according to that saieng of the Apostle.Ioh. 1. 12. Potestatem dedit, &c. He hath giuen power to them that beleeue in him, to be the sonnes of God. Now, seeing God, by the prea∣ching of the Gospell, calleth (all men) vnto faith, there is no doubt but Gods will is indéed, that (all men) should be saued. For, farre be it from the mindes of the godlie, to haue such a thought: namelie, that the heart of him which hath mercie differeth from the voice of him which calleth. In the third place, because it is come to passe through the sinne of our first parents, and by our owne default, that we are estraunged from God and put backe a farre off from Gods houshold, the Apostle sheweth a meane, whereby we are ioined to God againe, receiued into his
housholde, and adopted for his sonnes. This remedie or meane is Iesus Christ, the onelie Mediatour of God and men, who is apprehended and taken holde vpon by faith in the preaching of the Gospell, wherein the holie Ghost is effectuall and mightie in working. Héere all me∣rites of men, which make nothing for our saluation, are manifestlie ouerthrowne and laid along: likewise all pre∣rogatiue and boasting of the flesh is héere confounded, That he which glorieth,1. Cor. 1. 31 might glorie in the Lord, in whom we are both elect and predestinate. In the fourth place he expresseth the compelling cause of this excellent grace and adoption: namelie, that is to say, the bountifull, liberall, and fatherlie affection, or entier loue of our heauenlie father towards mankinde. This good will and loue of God, the Angels blaze abroad at the birth of Christ,Luke. 1. 14 saieng: Glo∣ria, &c. Glorie to God on high, in earth peace, & toward men good will. The verie same hath our heauenlie Fa∣ther himselfe testified from heauen,Math. 3. 4▪ 17. & 17. 5 Hic est, &c. This is my beloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased, that is to say, in whom I am become bountifull and fa∣uourable towards mankinde to worke his saluation. Let vs therefore take héede, that we séeke not the good plea∣sure and will of God towards vs elsewhere, than in Ie∣sus Christ alone, because in him, without all doubt, we shall finde the same by faith. In the fift place, the last ende of our adoption is ad∣ded, which is thrise repeated in this Chapter: to wit, That the glorie of his grace might be praised. For as our adoption is from God, so must the same be referred to God, that his goodnesse might be praised and magnifi∣ed through Iesus Christ. This end is not to be separated from the grace of adoption: whereby manifestlie appea∣reth, how necessarie new obedience is, in them which are regenerate and borne againe by faith. For héerein consisteth new obedience, that we should glo∣rifie
God in our minde, in our heart, in our voice, in our works, and (to be short) in our whole life. Let them therefore be ashamed of their follie, which teach, that the good works of Christians, are not onely not necessarie, but also hurtfull vnto men. In the fift place, he declareth from whence, and out of what fountaine that fatherlie good will and grace of God towards vs doth flow, when he saith: (Wherewith he hath made vs accepted in his beloued▪) This beloued Iesus Christ, is that fountaine, out of which that excee∣ding great grace of God towards vs doth issue: where vp∣on that falleth out iump which we noted before, that none shall be partaker of this grace, but they which lay hands vpon this beloued sonne of God by faith. In the seuenth place, some thing is said of redempti∣on: to wit, That the beloued sonne of God hath redée∣med vs by his bloud, and washed away our sinnes, that how many of vs so euer rest vpon him with a stedfast faith, might appeare iust and righteous in the sight of God. In the eight place, the principall cause of our redemp∣tion, wrought by Iesus Christ, is touched, where it is said, (According to the riches of his grace:) that is to say, according to the euerlasting & vnspeakable grace of God, whereby he would that his beloued sonne should be made a cleansing sacrifice for the sinnes of men: that the iustice of God, by that meanes might be satisfied, and that place might be left for his mercie. (The riches of his grace) doe signifie, (after the Hebrew phrase) Gods vnmeasura∣ble, bottomlesse, and euerlasting grace (as I said euen now:) which manner of speach the Apostle vseth vpon especiall reason, and singular purpose. Let vs therefore consider, not onely of what great price the bloud of Christ is in the sight of God: but also, how great the abundance of Gods grace is, flowing from the same: least any should thinke, that this grace of God stretcheth it selfe but to a
few: or that it is all spent long agoe, considering the de∣grees of ages past, and by that meanes, not to be sufficient for the cleansing of our sinnes, vpon whom the end of the world is come. See how richly stored this short point is, with most excellent and heauenlie things. Wherefore let the same be diligently learned, & each seueral word therof through∣ly considered. For, the mysterie of our saluation is no where, either more briefly, or more fitly described. Verses. 8. 9. &. 10. 8 Whereby hee hath bene a∣bundant towards vs, in all vvis∣dome and vnderstanding. 9 And hath opened vnto vs the mysterie of his vvill, accor∣ding to his good pleasure, vvhich he had purposed in him. 10 That in the dispensation of the fulnesse of the times, hee might gather together in one, all things, both vvhich are in heauen, and vvhich are in earth, euen in Christ. VVhich grace he hath shed vpon vs abundantly in all wis∣dome and prudence, in ma∣king knowne vnto vs the my∣sterie of his will, according to his good pleasure, which hee purposed in himselfe, to haue it declared when the time was full come to gather to∣gether all things in Christ, both the things which are in heauen, and also the things which are in earth, euen in him. LET the trim order of Paules words be marked. He∣therto he hath handled the causes of our blessing and saluation wonderfully, both with weightie words and matter. Now he commeth to the instrument, whereby that spirituall grace is reuealed, offered, and commu∣nicated vnto vs: namely, to the verie ministerie of the worde, of which ministerie he speaketh, not after a com∣mon manner, but déeplie and diuinelie, euen to this ende, that he might kindle in vs a greater zeale of this heauenly grace. The summe of this point, therefore is this. That the Apostle teacheth, that the grace of God which bringeth saluatiō to all men, is plentifully powred vpon vs by the Gospell, according to the good pleasure of
God, that at the length all might bée gathered againe in Christ. Now let vs throughly cōsider the seuerall words. In the first place ye Apostle vseth this word ( to abound) whereby those riches of Gods grace are signi∣fied, wherof he spake before: that we might know, that the grace of God is sufficient to saue all men. For the foun∣taine of grace is neuer drawn so drie, but euerie one may fetch frō it to serue their turne, so they carrie faith with them: neither can the sins of men be so many & so great, but they may be ouerwhelmed & drowned in the floud flowing from this fountaine, so that men séeke to get into Noes Arke, that is to say, into the houshold of God, by the faith of Christ. Let no man therfore despaire for ye great∣nesse & multitude of his sins, but whiles the time of grace yet lasteth, let him earnestly repent, & flie vnto him for succour who crieth out, That he came into ye world to saue sinners, & to receiue the repentant into grace & fauour. He addeth the effect or fruit of the Gospell in the hea∣rers: to wit, that thereby they are instructed (In all wis∣dome and vnderstanding.) For so doth the old Interpre∣tour, and Erasmus, translate the words verie well. Now these words are rightly discerned, if we referre wisdome () to knowledge: and vnderstanding () to practise. For these two things we must fetch from the preaching of the Gospell. Wisedome therefore signifieth the knowledge of the Gospell, that is say, the knowledge of God, and of all those things which are néedfull to be knowne for the obtaining of saluation. Vnderstanding, being the gouernesse of all our purposes and enterprises, applieth that knowledge to the framing of our life, and practising of that which is good: that we may abound, not onely in knowledge, but also in iudgement, as the Apo∣stle saith to the Philippians.Philip. 1. 9. Out of this effect or fruit of the Gospell, these specialties following may be gathered. The first, that the preaching of the Gospell is the re∣uelation of Gods grace towards mankinde: & also of his
election, whereby he chose vs in Christ. The second, that the perfect wisdome and vnderstan∣ding of Gods children is contained in the Gospell, so much as is sufficient for the obtaining of saluation. The third, which is concluded vpon the two former, that it is lawfull for Gods children, to set light by and to haue in contempt, without feare, all doctrines of men and Angels contrarie to the Gospell,Gal. 1. 8. yea, to count them ac∣cursed, according to that saieng, Let him bee accursed which preacheth anie other Gospell. Furthermore, whereas the Apostle presently addeth, (And hath opened vnto vs the mysterie of his will, ac∣cording to his good pleasure) he commendeth yet againe the Gospell vnto vs, in which commendation thrée things are principally to be marked. First, that he calleth the Gospell, a mysterie: that is to say, a secreat: wherevpon it followeth, that it is not the wisdome of mans reason, but of heauenlie grace. For if the reason of man could reach vnto it, Paule would not haue called it a mysterie. A reason why he calleth it by such a name,Rom. 16 25. 26. is expressed in his Epistle to the Romans, in these words: Iuxta Euangelium, &c. According to my Gospell, and preaching of Iesus Christ, by the reue∣lation of the mysterie, which was kept secreat since the world began: But now is opened and published among all nations, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at the commaundement of the euerlasting God, for the obedi∣ence of faith. Secondly, that the Gospell is the mysterie of Gods will, according to his good pleasure? But what is that will of good pleasure in God? That all nations might be∣léeue, and obey the Gospell. For so we taught euen now out of the Apostles words. Now, in that the euent or successe is not aunswera∣ble to the will of Gods good pleasure, the default is in men, who (to their owne destruction) maliciously refuse
saluation fréely offered. Therefore, the preaching of grace if thou looke to the purpose of God, and his good pleasure, is vniuersall, and stretcheth vnto all. But if thou consider the euent or successe, it séemeth to be particular, & to reach but to some, which (doubtlesse) commeth to passe through mans owne fault, not through the appointment of God which created him,1. Tim. 2. 4. & gaue his sonne to redéeme him. For God in deede would haue all men saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth: as we haue shewed before at large, where we declared that our election was cōditional. Thirdly, that the Apostle maketh the good pleasure of God the Father, the cause of the reuelation of this my∣sterie, as before he made it the cause of our election and predestination. Whereby we are admonished, that wée must iudge of our election and predestination by our cal∣ling: which calling, séeing it is as well vniuersall, accor∣ding to yt saieng: Ite in vniuersum, &c. Go ye throughout the whole world, and preach the Gospell vnto euerie creature, (whiles he nameth (euerie creature), he taketh away the difference of people and persons:) as also condi∣tionall, namely, the condition of faith, according to that saieng: Qui credident, &c. He that beleeueth shall be sa∣ued: therefore shall election and predestination be like∣wise conditionall, which are not to bée separated from Christ, who is the matter of them both. Now followeth a double circumstance of this good plea∣sure of God, the first is, of the time of the reuelation of the mysterie of the Gospell: the second is, of the ende of the reuelation. For when he saith (In the dispensation of the fulnesse of the times) he signifieth, that the good pleasure of God was then reuealed, when the time was come, which God had appointed with himselfe. Now, this time, as it was marked of the Patriarch Iacob with a speciall signe & token: so was it noted of Daniel the Prophet with a certaine bound & limit.Gen. 49. 1. Iacob saith, Non auferetur, &c. The scepter shall not depart from Iudah, vntill Shilo
come: that is to say, The seed promised to our forefathers. Daniel reckoneth thrée score & ten wéekes of the yeares from the captiuitie of Babylon,Dan. 9. 24 vntill the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. Of this time speaketh Paule, sai∣ing:Gal. 4. 4. 5 Quando vent, &c. When the fulnesse of time was come, God sent foorth his sonne made of a woman, and made vnder the law, that he might redeeme them which were vnder the lawe. The word (Dispensation) which Paule vseth in this place, is called in Gréeke , of which word there is a double vse. For one while (and that according to the Etymologie or right propertie of the same) it signifieth a care or charge, & good ordering of an house and houshold. An other while (but Metaphoricallie, or by translation,) it signifieth a disposing and fit framing of things which are to be done: or, a certaine kéeping of order in handling of matters. The second circumstance is of the ende of the reuela∣tion of Gods good pleasure, which is (To gather together in one, all things euen in Christ.) The Greeke word , which Saint Paule vseth, doth signifie, to ioine together into one bodie as it were, things set a sunder and scattered, and to knit them to one head. For the Substantiue , (from the which the Verbe is deriued) is (as it were) a certain summarie, & a gathering together of sundrie parts in one whole bodie. The Apostle therefore meaneth, that creatures, which were scattered, are gathered together in one, through Ie∣sus Christ, that béeing gathered together, they might bée all vnder one head. The diuision following comprehen∣deth the whole Church. (Which are (saith he) in heauen) that is to say, the holie Angels, and beléeuers, which de∣parted this life, before the sonne of God tooke flesh of the Virgin: (And which are in earth,) that is to saie, all such as doe beléeue, and shall beléeue in Christ, alreadie reuealed and come into the world, shall be vnder one head, as it were a bodie consisting of many and sundrie
members. Héere we are put in minde of faith, whereby we are knit vnto Christ our head: and of loue, wherby we are coupled in brotherhoode one with an other. This brotherhood or fellowship, is commended vnto vs by the Sacraments of the Church. Baptisme beareth witnesse that we are baptised into one bodie. The supper of the Lord, is a token of ye Communion which we haue with Christ: & it is a certaine testimonial & assured warrant of spiritual fraternitie and felowship betwéene our selues. Verse. 11. &. 12 11 In whom also we are cho∣sen, vvhen vvee vvere predesti∣nate, according to the purpose of him, vvhich vvorketh all things, after the counsell of his ovvne vvill. 12 That vve vvhich first tru∣sted in Christ, should bee vnto the praise of his glorie. In whom also we are chosen, be∣ing predestinate according to the purpose of him which wor∣keth all things according to the counsell of his will, that wee which before hoped in Christ, should be vnto the praise of his glorie. THus farre the Apostle hath spoken of all the elected and chosen in Christ generallie: now by distribution he applieth the generalitie, vnto two specialties: and first he toucheth the Iewes, declaring that they are made par∣takers of heauenlie grace. And he setteth downe in order three causes of this heauenlie grace: to wit, the efficient, the finall, and the instrumentall cause. Hée sheweth the efficient cause, when he saith, (Pre∣destinate according to the purpose of him.) Concer∣ning this cause, read that which we haue noted before alreadie. He addeth the finall cause, (That we should bee vn∣to the praise of his glorie,) that is to saie, that God him∣selfe might be praised for the greatnesse of his grace and mercie shewed vnto vs. He ioineth héer vnto ye instrument, when he saith, (That we which first hoped or trusted in Christ.) For vnder ye name of hope, he doth in this place comprehend faith also.
Now, whereas I expound that of faith, which is héere as∣cribed to hope, therein is no obscuritie or hardnesse. For, as faith is oftentimes taken for hope, so is hope taken for faith, by reason of a mutuall consequence, or following one of an other. For that, which faith laieth hold vpon & possesseth presently, that doth hope looke and waite for to come héereafter. These thrée causes of grace the Apostle setteth downe in this place, which grace, (as before he cal∣led it Gods blessing, or his adoption:) so héere it may be vn∣derstood by this word (Chosen) or choice: euen to this end, that we may know it is Gods frée gift. For it goeth not by lot that man is chosen, but it is the will of God which offereth saluation fréely vnto all. Now, where he addeth, (Which worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will) he giueth vs a double doctrine, or lesson to learne. The first is, that God is not tied (according to the destinie of the Stoikes) to second causes, but at frée & full libertie to doe what hée list. For hee, which by his counsell can, and by his power will do, is not compelled by any man∣ner of necessitie at all to doe this or that. For things de∣pending vpon necessitie, are neither gouerned by coun∣sell, nor dispensed withall by will. The second is, that God worketh in his Church all things that are whole∣some and good: and nothing that is euill, or commeth of sinne: as some out of this place vnaduisedly conclude, sai∣eng: He that saith all things, excludeth nothing. But their reason is ouerthrown by the Apostles words. For if God worketh all things by the counsell of his will: & his will be most holie, & so good as nothing better, intending no∣thing that is euill in anie respect,Psal. 5, 4. as the Psalmist most plainly pronounceth, Non volens, &c. Thou art a God which canst not away with iniquitie: truly it cannot be that God shuld be the author of sin, or of anie euill procée∣ding of a fault. Lastly, ye circumstance of the place restrai∣neth yt vniuersal word (all things) to one certeine kinde of action or déede. For ye text hangeth thus together, (Which
worketh all things, that we should be vnto the praise of his glorie,) that is to say, he bringeth to passe, that we both wil & do those things, which turne to the glorie and praise of God. The Apostle therefore speaketh manifest∣lie, of the wholsome or healthful workings of God in his Church. For he moueth our will, that we may will, and our strength, that we may not will in waste. Verse. 13, &. 14 13 In vvhom also ye haue tru∣sted, after that ye heard the vvord of truth, euen the gospel of your saluation, wherein also, after that ye beleeued, ye vvere sealed with the holie spirit of promise. 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance, vntill the redemp∣tion of the possession purcha∣sed vnto the praise of his glory. In whom also ye (hauing heard the word of truth, euen the Gospell of your saluation, wherein ye be∣leeued,) were sealed with the holie spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritaunce, vnto redemp∣tion, to the praise of his glo∣rie. THis is an other member of our diuision, wherein he applieth the partaking of heauenlie grace, spiritu∣all blessing, adoption, and election with the Saints, vnto the Gentiles, vnder the name of the Ephesians, drawing his argument from the effect or fruit of the Gospell prea∣ched among the Ephesians. But because this part is verie full of spirituall doctrine, I will lay it open, and declare it in his proper members, to the intent that the doctrine may the more plainlie be perceiued, and made to serue our vse. In the first place mention is made of the preaching of the Gospell, whereby God reuealeth vnto the world his will touching saluation fréelie giuen, and offereth the same indifferentlie vnto all,Marke. 16. 15. without respect of person or people, according to that saieng, Goe ye throughout the
whole world, and preach the Gospell vnto euerie crea∣ture. In the second place followeth faith, which being con∣ceiued in vs by the Gospell preached, the holie Ghost working effectually in our hearts, laieth fast holde vpon the saluation which the Gospell offereth, giuing vnto God the praise of his truth. In the third place is added the sealing of the holie spirit, wherewith we are then saied to be sea∣sed, when we bring forth the true fruites of faith, by the faith of Iesus Christ. This holie spirit, the Apostle cal∣leth (The spirit of promise,) both bicause it sealeth vnto vs the good things promised, and also bicause it is giuen vs by promise. In the fourth place is added the vse of this holie spi∣rite giuen vnto vs: namelie, (That it should be the earnest of our inheritance:) which we doe not yet per∣fectlie possesse, but looke & waite for the same, héerafter to come. For as that is an earnest, when some thing of the price is giuen, which is not to be drawen backe againe, but to be perfourmed and fullie downe paid: so the gi∣uing of the holie spirit, is a certaine part of our inheri∣taunce, bestowed vpon vs, for this ende: to wit, that we might be assured of the full and perfect possession of the whole inheritaunce, which is euerlasting life. And why is it called an inheritance, but because it pleased God, of his fatherlie goodnesse, without our merites, to appoint the same our portion, which are made the members of Christ the naturall sonne of God, vnto whom all things, which are his fathers, doe belong. In the fift place the circumstaunce of time is noted, (Vntill the redemptiō of the possessiō purchased,) saith the Apostle: that is to say, vntill the day of iudgement, when we which are redéemed with the price of Christs bloud, shall obtaine and enioie our full inheritance. (Vn∣till the redemption) therefore, that is to say, vntill the
day of redemption: (Of the possession purchased,) that is to say, for vs, who by our redemption wrought in his bloud, are put in possession of the promised inheritance. Hetherto we haue vntwisted, as it were, and laid open this present point, in his proper parts or members: in the which our Apostle setteth out verie trimlie, the man∣ner and order of our restitution or redemption. For he beginneth at the preaching of the Gospell, and teacheth vs, that faith must be added therevnto: which being done, the sealing of the holie spirit is felt in the heart, which is a certaine earnest as it were of the promised in∣heritance. The last end of all these, is the glorie of God, of his mercie healing, and also sauing all such as beléeue. For (saith Saint Ambrose) as it is ye Physicians praise and commendation, if he heale manie: so the praise of Gods glorie is, when manie are wonne to beléeue with vnfeigned faith. Finallie, we must marke, that the Apo∣stle decketh the Gospell of Christ with a double title. For first, by the figure Antonomasia, he calleth the Gos∣pell (The word of truth:) which title is taken of the matter conteined in the Gospell. For the Gospell doeth conteine the euerlasting truth of God, & an vndeceiuable testimonie of obteining saluation through Christ. The se∣cond is, (The Gospell of saluation,) which is taken of the end of the Gospell. For the Gospell was ordeined and gi∣uen for our saluation. For, as the Law, whiles it requi∣reth righteousnesse, promiseth saluation and life to them which fulfill the same: & contrariwise, threateneth dam∣nation & death to all the transgressours thereof: so the Gospell, because we haue not the righteousnes which the Lawe requireth, sheweth Christ vnto vs, who is ye end of the Law to all them that beléeue. Thus ye righteousnes & saluation, which we could not reach vnto in doing, we ob∣teine in beléeuing, whiles ye righteousnes of Christ being imputed vnto vs, & our sins washed away by ye sacrifice of himself, we are made righteous, & heires also of salua∣tion.
Neither is this slightlie to be ouerslipped, that as before he made the glorie of God the end of our election, of our predestination, and likewise of our calling: so héere also, he maketh the same the ende of our sanctification. Wherevpon it followeth, that all glorie of saluation, must be taken quite away from euerie creature, and me∣rite of man, and giuen to God alone by Iesus Christ. Wherefore, as in all things that are good, so héere chiefe∣lie that short sentence of Nazianzen taketh place, , that is to say, Make God the beginning and ende of euerie thing. Verse. 15, &. 16. 15 Therefore also, after that I heard of the faith, vvhich ye haue in the Lord Iesus, & loue towards all Saints, 16 I cease not to giue thanks for you, making mention of you in my praiers. For this cause I also hauing heard of your faith in the Lord Iesus, & your loue towards all the Saints, cease not to giue thankes for you, making mention of you in my praiers. THe Apostle hauing reckoned vp the benefites of God bestowed vpon mankinde, doth shew, what the think∣ing vpon these benefites wrought in himselfe: namelie, a mouing and stirring of him vp to giue God thankes, who is the Authour and fountaine of so great good. It is méete that this deede of the Apostle, should be vnto vs a rule well worthie the marking, throughout the whole course of our life: that the remembraunce and calling to accompt of Gods good gifts and benefits, might stirre vs vp to thankesgiuing. For he which thinketh vpon Gods benefites, or heareth them rehearsed or named, and bur∣steth not foorth with an affection of heart into thankesgi∣uing, besides that he is vnthankfull to God, and therfore vnrighteous: so he deserueth by his vnthankfulnesse, to be spoiled of all Gods graces. For, as in the possession of things, not onelie the right of possessing, but also the
lawfull vsing of them is required: so it is méete, that a Christian vse those graces, which he possesseth by the me∣rite of Christ, and therefore by good right, to the glorie of God the giuer, with thankesgiuing. Lastlie, this place teacheth, that this is a most right order: namelie, that thankesgiuing for benefits receiued goe before, and that praier followe by and by at the foote thereof, wherein we must craue of God, the kéeping of his benefits receiued, and other healthfull gifts, good and necessarie. Further∣more, this place teacheth vs, that the profiting of men in godlinesse, is the méere benefit of God. For, whiles Paule giueth God thankes, that the Ephesians profit in hope and charitie (or trust and loue,) he acknowledgeth that God is the Author of this good. For he, of his frée goodnes, raiseth vp good gouernours of Common wealths, and sendeth sincere ministers of the Gospell: besides that, he is forceable in working by his spirit, in the hearts of the hearers of his word, both whiles they are present at the preaching thereof, and also otherwise exercised in the same: bringing this to passe in them: namelie, that they should both beléeue and loue him. Moreouer, this place teacheth, what be the principall duties of Christi∣ans, which he draweth vnto two heads, to wit, to ye faith of Iesus Christ, and to loue towards the Saints. These notwithstanding ought so to be vnderstood, that together with them, all things which are naturallie ioined with them: namelie, their necessarie effects or fruits be also vnderstood. Faith therefore, when it hath hope ioined with it, in∣uocation or calling vpon God, the feare of God, loue, pa∣tience, and such like, they are not giuen vnto vs, with∣out their fruites. Semblablie, loue comprehendeth the duties of loue towards all men.
Verse. 17. & 18. 17 That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of glo∣rie, might giue vnto you, the spirit of vvisedome & reuelati∣on, through the knovvledge of him, 18 That the eyes of your vn∣derstanding may be lightened. That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of glo∣rie, might giue vnto you the spirit of wisedome and reuela∣tion in the knowledge of him∣selfe, & lighten the eies of your minde. THe Apostle declareth, what he wisheth to the E∣phesians in his praiers: to wit, (The spirit of wisdome and reuelation, through the knowledge of Ie∣sus Christ,) that is to say, a true knowledge of the myste∣rie of the Gospell, which the spirit reuealeth, when the Gospell is effectuall in the hearts of the hearers thereof, and the meditaters therevpon. For séeing the Gospell guideth vs to the knowledge of Christ, who is the wise∣dome of his Father giuen vnto vs of God: we are also possessed with the spirit of wisedome, whereby the eies of our minde are enlightened, to vnderstand the mysterie of the Gospell. Now let vs sée the circumstaunces of the Apostles praier. The first is, that he praieth vnto God, who as he alone is the Authour of all good things: so he alone is to be called vpon. The second is, by and through whom he praieth: this he sheweth when he saith, (The God of our Lord Iesus Christ:) as if he should say: I leane not to mine owne merites, but boldlie staieng my self vpon the intercession, of Christ, I call vpon God. For he alone is the Mediatour betwene God & men: & ther∣fore he himselfe said,1. Tim. 2. 5 Quicquid, &c. Whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my name,Math. 7. 7 16. he shall giue it you. Athanasius putteth these words (Of our Lord Iesus Christ) in a Parenthesis,Mark. 11. 24. that glorie should goe with the word,Luke. 11. 9. God, and not with the word Father. But this is pinched in too much,Iohn. 14. 13 & 15. 7. & 16. 24. or too strait laced: let vs rather place the words in this order, (The God of our Lord Iesus Christ, and Father of glorie.) For the Apostle séemeth to haue an eie to the words of the Lord after he was rai∣sed
vp from the dead,Iohn. 20. 17. and speaking in this manner, I a∣scend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God. Therefore was Christ borne a man, not onelie that he might haue a common Father with vs, but also a God: from whom the greatest comfort of the faith∣full floweth. For thus doth faith conclude. The Father and God of our Lord Iesus Christ, is likewise our Fa∣ther & God. Therfore, we are partakers of all heauenlie benefits with Christ, our copartner. Therfore his will & pleasure is to doe vs good: and he both knoweth and also can giue vs those things, that are healthfull to serue for our saluation. But how hangeth this together? What? Is not the sonne equall to the Father? As (doubtlesse) he is consubstantiall, so is he coequall with the Father: But the sonne abased himselfe,Phi. 2. 7. 8. putting on the state and con∣dition of a seruant. And albeit it agréeth properlie with the nature of man, that Christ should be subiect vnto God the Father: yet neuerthelesse, that is referred to the ve∣rie person, in respect of the vnitie of the person, bicause Christ is both God & man. Furthermore, God is called (The Father of glorie:) first, bicause all things are full of his glorie: secondlie, bicause all glorie belongeth to him a∣lone: Lastlie, bicause he is the Author & fountaine of all glorie. Now the cause why Saint Paule in this place giueth God this title, is this. He praieth vnto God, that it would please him to giue the Ephesians the spirit of wisedome, &c. Which gift (doubtlesse) both tendeth to the glorie of God: and also bringeth to passe, that the Ephe∣sians are made partakers of heauenlie glorie. For it is a common thing and much vsed in the scriptures, to giue certeine titles vnto God, in consideration of the matter which is handeled. Wherevpon it followeth, that one while he is called,2. Cor. 1. 3. Pater misericordiarum, The Father of mercies:2. Cor. 1. 3. another while, Deus omnis consolationis, The God of all comfort:Psal. 88. 1. Deus salutis, The God of saluation: Deus pacis & dilectionis,2. Cor. 13. 11. The God of peace & loue. Of
this kinde there are manie examples in the Psalmes of Dauid,Psal. 17. 1 as when it is said, Dominus fortitudo, &c. The Lord is my strength,Psal. 43. 2 and the horne of my health. A∣gaine, Dominus,Psal. 118. 14. &c. The Lod is my rocke. Againe, Deus, &c. God is my refuge & my strength. Againe, De∣us, &c. The Lord is a God of vengeaunce, the Lord is a God of iudgement. It shall be good and profitable for vs, to followe and kéepe this order in our praiers. For it is much materi∣all and auailable, to stirre vp and quicken our mindes as we are a praieng. The third circumstance is, that Saint Paule wisheth healthfull things to the faithfull Ephesians in Christ: to wit, (The spirit of wisedome and reuelation, and the enlightning of the eyes of their minde,) that they might knowe Christ. This circumstaunce admonisheth the mi∣nisters of the word of their dutie: namelie, that they ought not onlie to teach their hearers healthfull things, but also to wish them healthfull things. Verse. 18. 19. & 20. 18 That ye may knovve vvhat is the hope of his calling, and vvhat is the riches of his glori∣ous inheritaunce in the Saints, 19 And what is the exceeding greatnes of his povver tovvards vs, vvhich beleeue, according to the vvorking of his mightie povver, 20 Which he vvrought in Christ. That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, & what be the riches of the loue of his inheritaunce in the Saints, and what is the superexcellent great nesse of his power to vs ward, which beleeue according to the working of the power of the might which he hath wrought in Christ. THe Apostle declareth to what ende (The spirit of wisedome and reuelation) which he wisheth to the Ephesians, perteineth vnto wit, & knowledge, that they might vnderstand, how great that treasure of heauenlie grace is, which they obtaine in Christ.
And he vseth in this place a figure of Rhetorike, called Expolitio, both to amplifie & inlarge the thing: & also, that this treasure may the better be valued, (as much as may be) according to the price and worthinesse of the same. In the first place he wisheth, that the Ephesians may know (What is the hope of their vocation or calling:) that is to saie, that they might vnderstand, how notable, precious, and excellent, those heauenlie graces are, which Christ setteth foorth in his Gospell, and to the which, such as be∣léeue are called. In the word (Hope) is contained a figure called Metonymia. For (Hope) in this place is taken for the thing whereto it is applied, that is to saie, for the thing hoped.Gal. 5. 5. So the Apostle to the Galathians, calleth hoped righteousnes, The hope of righteousnesse, where∣by we are made like vnto God in all eternitie or euerla∣stingnesse, after we haue departed this life in true faith and Christian calling. The hope therefore of our calling, is that happinesse, wherevnto the Gospell calleth vs. This hope the Apostle expoundeth, saieng: (And what is the riches of his glorious inheritaunce) that is to saie, That ye may know how great and inestimable that glo∣rious inheritaunce of the children of God is: namely, of them which beléeue the Gospell. Héerevnto is added an amplification or enlargement drawn from the cause (And what is the exceeding great∣nesse of his power, towards vs which beleeue:) as if hée should haue said, We obtaine not that treasure of hea∣uenlie graces by our owne strength & abilitie, or by our owne merits and deserts: but by the power of God. Nei∣ther must we idley passe ouer that, where he saith, (To∣wards vs which beleeue.) For he meaneth, that faith is the instrument, whereby wée receiue and possesse this treasure, the holy spirit béeing an assured earnest of the same, as we haue declared before. And where he addeth, (According to the working of his mightie power) that is done for vehemencie and force
sake, that we might be quickned, earnestly to cōsider what the cause should bée, from whence so great a treasure of saluation doth come: and that we might not, either by slouthfulnesse, or mistrustfulnesse ware faintharted and wearie, to goe forward in the course or race which we haue begun. The words Robur, Potentia, & Efficacia, in English, Power, Might, and Working, serue to none other ende, but to teach vs that the power of God cannot bée ouercome, whereby as he is able to do what he will: so he will giue to them that beléeue, the treasure promi∣sed in Christ, in due time: of which thing he setteth downe a certaine token, saieng: (Which he wrought in Christ,) that is to saie, which power God declared in Christ: as if he said, God shewed no small signe of his power in Christ your head, whose members séeing you are, he will glorifie you, which beléeue, with the like power. The words, Robur, Potentia, & Efficacia, are thus di∣stinguished, and discerned, the one from the other. , Robur, is of nature, and is properly, actiuitie or might. , Potentia, that is power or abilitie, hath respect vnto the things whereto they are applied. , Efficacia, that is, efficacie or working, is the effect of both. Some make the difference thus, that Robur is as it were the root, Potentia the trée, and Efficacia the fruit. Out of this place of the Apostle, let vs learne to sette the power of God, both against the mistrustfulnesse of our flesh, and also against the arguments of foolish rea∣son, wherewith the diuell bewitching mens mindes, would withdraw vs from the hope of our calling, which we haue in Christ Iesus. Verses. 20. 21. 22. & 23. 20 When he raised him from the dead, & set him at his right hand in the heauenlie places,
21 Farre aboue all principali∣tie, and povver, and might, and domination, and euerie name that is named, not in this world onelie, but also in that vvhich is to come. 22 And hath made all things subiect vnder his feet, & hath appointed him ouer all things, to be the head of the Church, 23 Which is his bodie, euen the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all things. VVhiles he raised him from the dead, and made him sit at his right hand in heauenlie things, aboue all principalitie (or rule) & power, & might, and dominion (or Lordship) and aboue all names that are na∣med, not onelie in this world, but also in the world to come, and hath put all things vnder his feete, & set him aboue all things, euen the head of the Church, which is his bodie, and the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all. WHat maner of working the excéeding power of God hath, which ye Apostle saith, God hath wrought in Christ, he declareth by a verie trim diuision, wherein the glorie of Christ triumphing is set before our eyes: and the principall points of our faith in Christ are recited, the exposition whereof more at large, is to be fetcht out of other places of holie Scripture. Now, to the intent we may effectuallie applie euerie thing to the stirring vp and confirming of our faith, wee will laie it downe in partes, and diuide this conclusion into seuen partes or members: then will wée shew, and that brieflie, what our faith may gather out of them se∣uerally. The first member is declared in these words, (When he raised him from the dead,) that is to saie, God, in rai∣sing his sonne from the dead, shewed the working of his excéeding power.Ioh. 19. 33 Of this first member, there are thrée points. The first, of the Lordes death. The second, of his resurrection. The third, of the power whereby he was raised.Iohn. 20. 1. 2. &c. Of these thrée pointes wée will giue you a verie short admonition The historie of the Lords death, is well knowne by ye writings of the Prophets, ye Apostles, & the Creeds. But ye power & working therof is diligentlie to be distinguished & sundered, frō the passions or sufferings, &
the deaths of other Saints or holie men. For the passi∣ons or sufferings, and the deaths of other Saints, were ei∣ther martyrdoms, or trials of their faith and confession: or els, as for example in the théefe, certaine punishments for offences. But the death and passion of Christ is farre otherwise to be considered, which Christ himselfe defi∣neth to be sanctification, that is to saie, an offering vp of himself for many. And he defineth the same : for he saith thus,Mat. 20. 28. The sonne of man came not to be mini∣stred vnto, but to minister,Mark. 10. 45. and to giue his life , a redemption for many. Nowe,  is not redemption,Luke. 22. 27. as the olde intrepreter hath translated it, but the price of redemption. For,  in Gréeke signifieth, whatsoeuer is paid downe for their redempti∣on, which are kept in captiuitie, which Homer in his Iliads calleth , that is to say, the price of redemp∣tion. The passion and death of Christ therefore is , the price downe paid for the redemption of men, who were held captiues and prisoners vnder the power of the deuill: which price was paid to God, by whose iust iudg∣ment we were captiues. This price hath his infinit esti∣mation, & vncountable value, from the wonderfull vni∣on or knitting of Gods nature and mans in one per∣son. Wherevpon Saint Paule doubteth not to speake thus:Acts. 20. 28. Ecclesiam, &c. The Church of God which he hath purchased with his owne bloud. Héerevnto we will adde a fuller definition for decla∣ration sake. The passion and death of our Lord Iesus Christ, God and man, is a propitiatorie sacrifice, or sacri∣fice of attonement, wherein the eternall son of the eter∣nall God, béeing made man, offered himselfe by the eter∣nall spirit vnto his father, that by this his oblation & obe∣dience, he might both purge the sinnes of the world, and appease the wrath of God, to the ende that all such as beléeue, might be sanctified vnto life euerlasting through
him. As by this definition our vnderstanding and iudge∣ment is rightly informed and taught concerning the pas∣sion and death of Christ: so our faith must be stirred vp and stedfastlie resolued, that sinne is so washed awaie by the death of Christ, as that God doth remember it no more. Moreouer wee must and ought, with continuall thankfulnsse, and innocencie of life, to aduaunce and ex∣toll this great benefit. The second point of this first member is, of the Lordes resurrection, wherof wée will shew brieflie what is to be thought faithfullie and godlie. First of all we must holde fast the testimonies of his resurrection, which are of thrée sortes, as commonlie I make them: touch∣ing these, the Catechisme, and the historie of Christs re∣surrection set foorth in the Gospell, must bée looked vp∣on and considered. The definition of the Lordes resur∣rection must bée maintained: to wit, that the resurrecti∣on of Christ from the dead, is Christs victorie, and his tri∣umph ouer sinne, death, hell, and ouer the whole king∣dome of Sathan. For Christ by his resurrection, fulfil∣led the promise:Gen. 3. 15. Semen mulieris, &c. The seede of the woman shall bruse the Serpents head: that is to saie, (as Saint Iohn the Lords Apostle expoundeth it,)1. Ioh. 3. 8 Chri∣stus apparuit, &c. Christ appeared that hee might de∣storie the workes of the diuell. Christ therefore rising againe, is conquerour ouer Sathan, which Sathan li∣eth conquered and crushed vnder the féete of Christ the conquerour, that hée is no more able to drawe the faith∣full, that is to saie, the members of Christ, into death and destruction, although he beare full swaie ouer the reprobate and obstinate: and vseth manie and sundrie guilefull sleights, to prouoke the faithfull to tast the for∣bidden fruite, and so to be cast againe out of the Lordes Paradise: that is to saie, hée goeth about with corrupt doctrine, and lewde manners, to infect and poi∣son the faithfull, that the holie Ghost might be driuen
out of them, and so they, through the losse of faith, might bée shut out of Gods housholde, and so become casta∣waies. In the third place the fruites of the Lords resur∣rection must bée gathered, which the godlie alone enioie: the first wherof is,1. Cor. 15. 17. remission of sinnes. Si Christus, &c. If Christ bee not risen, ye are yet in your sinnes. Héere∣vnto serueth that saieng of the Prophet Daniel:Dan. 9. 24 Aufe∣retur, &c. Wickednesse shall be finished, sinnes shall be sealed vp, and iniquitie reconciled. And although the reconcilement of iniquitie, bée most properlie appertai∣ning to Christs passion and death, as before is declared: yet notwithstanding, it is also verie well applied to his resurrection, bicause this is the accomplishment of all Christs benefits. The second is, our iustification: Re∣surrexit,Rom. 4. 25 &c. Christ is risen againe for our iustification. And Daniel saith,Dan. 9. 24 Adducetur, &c. Euerlasting righte∣ousnesse shall be brought in. Doth not Saint Paule likewise define the obedience of Christ to bée our righte∣ousnesse? Both are true. For whatsoeuer is giuen to one action or déede of Christ, the same is rightlie giuen to them all, by reason of the ordinarie appointment and or∣dinance common to all his works and actions. The third is,Ioh. 16. 7 the giuing of the spirit. Nisi, &c. Except I goe my waie, that comforter shall not come. And Paule saith, E∣misit,Rom. 8. 15 &c. He hath sent the spirit of his sonne into your hearts,Gal. 4. 6. which crieth, Abba Pater, Abba Father. The fourth is, the confirming of the couenant of grace, or an assurance and certaine warrant of a good conscience be∣fore God. For so saith S. Peter, Habentes, &c. Hauing a good conscience.1. Pet. 3. 16, &. 21 And, In that a good conscience ma∣keth request vnto God, The words at large lie in this order, Cui respondens, &c. To the which also the fi∣gure that now saueth vs (euen Baptisme) agreeth: (not the putting awaie of the filth of the flesh, but in that a good conscience maketh request vnto GOD) by the resurrection of Iesus Christ. The fift is, the renew∣ing
of our selues, which is after two sortes, to wit, of our soules, and of our bodies. Of our soules, according to that saieng of the Apostle,Rom. 6. 4. Resurrexit, &c. Christ was raised vp from the dead, by the glorie of his Fa∣ther, that wee also should walke in newnesse of life. Of our bodies, according to the wordes of the Apostle, Christus resurrexit,1. Cor. 15. 20. 21. 22 &c. Christ is risen from the dead, and was made the first fruites of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, euen so in Christ all shall be made aliue. The sixt is, the bonde of mutuall fraternitie and brotherhoode. For so the Lorde himselfe rising from the dead, spea∣keth to the women by, Ascendo, &c. I go vp to my Fa∣ther, and to your Father: my God, and your God. If therefore wée all haue but one Father in common to vs all, if wée all are brothers and sisters in Christ: it is méete, that like brothers and sisters wée bée all of one minde, and tender one an other with brotherlie affection and loue. The seuenth is, a generall reme∣die against all calamities, against all woundes or sores of the soule, of the bodie, of our name and fame. Heere∣vnto serueth the saieng of the Apostle to Timothie,2. Tim. 2. 8. Memento, &c. Remember that Iesus Christ is risen from the dead: as if he should haue said, In this thy ministerie and office thou shalt féele manie distresses, thou shalt suf∣fer manie temptatious of the Diuell, and of men: but in all these, take vnto thée for thy succour & saftie, this nota∣ble Treacle, namelie, the meditating of the Lordes resurrection: which as in the Lorde himselfe it was the victorie ouer all temptations and afflictions: so like∣wise in vs it shall bée the same victorie, when we shall be raised vp from the dead, by the power of Christs re∣surrection. The eight is, a perfect hope, or assured per∣suasion of our glorious state and immortalitie. Saint
Peter saith,1. Pet. 1. 3 Regenuit nos, &c. Hee hath begotten vs a∣gaine vnto a liuelie hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead. The third point of this first member is, of the power whereby the Lord was raised from the dead.Ioh. 10. 17. Christ saith, Potestatem habeo, &c. I haue power to put away my life from me, and to take it againe. Now, in this place, God the Father is said to haue raised him vp. In these words there is no contrarietie of speach. Christ in déed raised vp himselfe, as God, that is to saie, hée raised vp the na∣ture of his manhood, by the power of his Godhead: and the Father raised him vp, as man. To bée short be∣cause the essence or béeing of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost is all one, and the selfe same, as touching their diuinitie or Godhead, their works are vnseparable. Let these things suffice to be briefly spoken, concerning the first member of this point: whereof in generall there is a double vse: to wit, that wée should be con∣firmed and established in the knowledge of Christs death and resurrection: and that we should proue and trie in our selues a liuelie and quicke féeling of the same. In which sense S. Paule speaketh to the Romanes,Rom. 6. 4. 6, &c. where he ascri∣beth mortification & viuification (or for the better vnder∣standing of the words, the making of vs dead, & the ma∣king of vs aliue) that is to saie, newnesse of life, vnto the Lords death and resurrection. The second member now followeth, wherof the Apo∣stle speaketh, saieng: (And hath set him at his right hand in the heauenlie places.) This member conteineth two Articles of our beliefe: the first is, The Lords ascending into Heauen: the second is, his sitting at the right hand of God. For his ascending thether went before his sit∣ting there. Nowe, this ascending of the Lord was done visible. For hée was carried vp into heauen in a bodilie and naturall manner from the sight of his Disciples. For so it is saide in the Actes, Cernenti∣bus
ipsis,Acts. 1. 9. &c. While they beheld, hee was taken vp: for a clowde tooke him vp out of their sight. And from thence was he caried aboue al heauens, & placed in heauenlie places, at the right hand of God his Father: as Saint Paule sheweth in this place, and in the fourth Chapter following. The Article therefore of the Lords ascending, ought to be vnderstood of Christs true and ve∣rie bodie, and of the naturall placing thereof in heauen, least we should thinke, that Christs manhood was swal∣lowed vp of his Godhead, as Stenkfield dreamed: or that it was extended & spread throughout all places with his Godhead, as the heretike Eutyches doted. For both their opinions doth take away the truth of his humanitie or manhood. The saieng therefore of Saint Cyprian is to be allowed, in these words: Ascendit in coelis, &c. He ascended into heauen, not where God the word was not before: but where the word being made flesh sate not before, to wit, in a bodilie place. The sitting at the right hand of God his Father, belongeth to the power of ruling, wherein the sonne being equall with his Father, doth as it were part stakes, and possesseth equall rule and regiment with him. For the right hand of the Father, be∣tokeneth a diuine power, maiestie, and dominion. Wher∣fore, to sit at the right hand of the Father, is to be equall with the Father in diuine power, maiestie, and domini∣on. And because the Apostle maketh mention of (The right hand of the Father in heauenlie places,) he there∣fore giueth vs to note by the right hand of the Father, the place of blessednesse, happinesse, and euerlasting rest and quietnesse, promised to all faithfull belée∣uers, which place the bodie of Christ alreadie pos∣sesseth. But this is not against the saieng of Christ,Matth. 28. 20. Ero vobis∣cum, &c. I wil be with you euerie where, euen to the end of the world: neither doth it take away the truth of the Lords bodie and bloud in the holie Supper. For Christ
is all whole, wheresoeuer it is his will to be. More of this matter, and that verie learned and godlie, is to be read in the Commentaries of Philip Melancthon vpon the first Chapter to the Colossians. Furthermore the fruite of either article: namelie, of the Lords ascending, and of his sitting at the right hand of the Father, is declared at large in the fourth Chapter folowing,Psa. 68. 18 where ye Apostle expoundeth this saieng of the Psalmist, Ascendit in altum, &c. He ascended vp on high, he lead captiuitie captiue, & gaue gifts vnto men. The third member is an exposition of the second. (Farre aboue all principalitie, & power, and might, and domination, and euerie name that is named, not in this world onelie, but also in that which is to come.) For in these words the Apostle sheweth verie notablie, what Christ, sitting at the right hand of his Father in heauenlie places, is. For, by these words, the Apostle meaneth no∣thing else, than to signifie Christs rule, which is noted to be excéeding great, as the Article of his sitting at his Fathers right hand importeth: and that he hath no rule, either in this world, or in the world to come, aboue that. Now, whereas Dionysius out of these words of the A∣postle, maketh I wot not what orders of Angels, it is but weake. Neither is it to anie purpose to knowe, what orders of Angels, and what degrées of dignities are in Heauen: séeing that the word of God sheweth no such thing vnto vs. Onelie let this be inough for vs to vnder∣stand, That Angels are ministers: & (as in the Epistle to the Hebrewes is declared, ministering spirits ministers of the Churches,Heb. 1. 14. of Commonwealths, & of housholds in the world. Now, touching the words of Saint Paule, this is worth the knowing, that he maketh difference verie trimlie of degrées in dignities by these foure words, (Principalitie, Power, Might, and Domination.) , Principalitie, signifieth an order of the higher to the lower, from whom obedience must procéede to the
higher, as to the better. When therefore the Apostle saith, (That Christ sitteth farre aboue all Principalitie,) he meaneth, that Christ is Lord and King , that is, at no mans call or commaund, to giue a recko∣ning of his rule. For he hath no Prince aboue him, to whom he is compelled as a subiect to be obedient, & to serue. For, as he is of one & the selfe same nature with his Father touching his Godhead: so hath he equall rule with his Father. Héerehence let euerie faithfull soule comfort himselfe against the enimies of Christ, and against all principalities of the world and of Hell: yea, let him make full accompt, that it shall one day come to passe, that whatsoeuer is alofte, shall be brought downe, and made subiect, (will they, nill they,) to the rule of Christ. Let no Christian therefore, if he loue godlinesse, become obedient, either to men or Diuels, if they com∣maund anie thing that is against the lawes of Iesus Christ our Prince. , Power, betokeneth the right of ruling: which right is due to Christ, for two reasons, First, in respect of his nature, as he is God, whereby he is one & the same God with the Father and the Holie Ghost, to whom all things are of right in subiection. Secondlie, in conside∣ration of the victorie, whereby he ouercame the Diuell our open aduersarie: so that Christ is aboue all, by the right of ruling both waies. , Might, noteth the ablenesse of his rule, so that no force or puissance can empaire his rule, or lessen it. Héereby faith hath wherewith to encourage it selfe, in temptations, and at the point of death, against all the assaults of the Diuell. For if the might of Christ doeth ouermaster all other manner of mights, then there is no cause why the faithfull should feare the gates of hell. , Domination, hath relation to all creatures,
good and badde, whom Christ is able to make couch and lie at his feete, by the vertue of his power: and can con∣straine them, (will they, nill they,) to confesse Christ their King and Conquerour. Héerevpon it is written to the Romanes,Rom. 14. 11. and to the Philippians, Quòd omne genu, &c. That at the name of Iesus, euerie knee should bow, both of things in Heauen,Phil. 2. 10. and things in earth, and things vn∣der the earth, acknowledging his rule and power. Héer∣vnto Saint Paule addeth the generalitie, saieng: (And aboue euerie name that is named) that is to say, aboue euerie thing, which excelleth anie manner of way, what∣soeuer. The diuision which followeth, (Not in this world onelie, but also in that which is to come,) is re∣ferred to the foure former members. For it importeth thus much, That Christ is far aboue all things, not one∣lie in this transitorie world now present, but in the euerlasting world which is to come. The prerogatiue therefore or souereigntie of Christ, aboue all principali∣tie, power, might, and domination, is not temporall, but eternall: for it stretcheth out euen to the world to come. There is no cause therfore why the faithfull should feare, least Christ being at anie time disgarded, and put beside his rule, they should suffer the iniuries, and féele the ty∣rannies of their enimies: or should bée pressed downe, and wrongfullie kept vnder, with the rule of some new Lord succéeding. The fift member conteineth the largenesse of his rule and kingdome. The Apostle saith, (And hath made all things subiect vnder his feete.) For as before, he was made the seruaunt of all, that he might saue man, who was lost and cast away: so now, being made Conque∣rour, he hath all things at his commaundement and ser∣uice: insomuch that all things are forced to fall at his féete, and to stand in awe of his gouernment. Neither is this subiection proper to his friends and houshold onelie: but perteineth also to his enimies, to all diuells, & wicked
men, insomuch that the verie Diuels themselues obeie Christ with quaking and trembling. Héerehence hath faith wherewith to strengthen it selfe against all the gates of Hell. For faith must be suaded, and builded vpon this sure ground, that  much stronger, than that anie can or dare spoile him, and take anie thing from him against his will. The sixt member conteineth a certeine singular forme or manner of Christs rule and regiment, whereby he go∣uerneth the Church of God. For the Apostle saith) (And hath appointed him ouer all things, to be the head to the Church.) Now whereas Christ is héere said (To be appointed of the Father the head to the Church,) this doth neuer a whit lessen or diminish the maiestie of Christ, whereby (according to his nature, as he is God,) he hath rule ouer all things with his Father. For Christ (as Gregorie of Nice saith) is said to take or receiue that as man, which he hath naturallie as God. By this tearme Head, is signified, both that supre∣masie or souereigne rule of Christ, which he alone hath ouer the Church: and also the glorie of the Church. For, if Christ be the head, and the Church the bodie, then (no doubt) great is the glorie of the Church. For, where the head is, there is likewise the bodie. For there is no middle place, whereby the head should be separated from the bodie. Whosoeuer therefore (besides Iesus Christ alone) taketh vnto himselfe this honour, and will be counted, called, and knowne the head of the Church, he is a right Antichrist, and one which traiterouslie sée∣keth to robbe Christ of his honour. As for that which the Popes mainteiners bring, who imagine that the Church hath two heads: the one gouerning, as principall: the other obeieng as vassall: it is nothing. For the mini∣sters of the Church of God, though some haue this de∣grée of dignitie, or place of preeminence: other some that, for the better ordering of the Church: yet notwith∣standing,
all are ministers, neither is one the others head, but fellowe seruants in the Lord. So Saint Paule cal∣leth them which were ministers vnder him, Fellowe ser∣uants,Col. 1. 7. & 4. 7. 9. fellowe souldiors, fellowe workers of God, & bre∣theren. Furthermore, Christ is called (The head of the Church,)Phil. 2. 25. foure waies. First, in power and force. For as the powers of man,3. Ioh. 1. 2. comming from the head, are con∣ueied throughout the whole bodie, by the veines and si∣newes: so the faithfull, what force soeuer they haue, they receiue it from Christ. For, in that the faithfull are mortified in the flesh, and quickened in the spirit, they haue that by the power of Christs death and resurrection, who is their head. For the power and vertue of Christs death kéepeth the flesh vnder in the beléeuers: and by the efficacie and force of Christs life, a new spirit is begot∣ten in man: whereby it commeth to passe, that he walk∣eth in newnesse of life. Secondlie, Christ is called (The head of the Church) in perfection. For he alone deserueth the praise of perfection in the Church. For all vertues in him are most perfect, from whom certeine beames (as it were from the Sunne) doe shine & shoote vpon the faith∣full. Thirdlie, Christ is called (The head of the Church) in merit. For he alone in the Church hath merits, where∣with he merited and deserued for vs the heauenlie inhe∣ritaunce. Fourthlie, Christ is called (The head of the Church) in dignitie, order and authoritie. For he alone is the Monarch of the Church, and a Prince at no mans controllment. But least anie should thinke, that S. Paule speaketh, of Christ onelie, as of the Prince of the Church, he ad∣deth a seuenth member, and saith: (Of the Church, which is his bodie.) Christ therfore is the head, & the Church his bodie, to whom all efficacie force, & power floweth from the head Heere we haue to marke a verie trimme defini∣tion of the Church, whereby it is defined to be (The bo∣die of Christ,) not naturall, but mysticall. Of this bodie
there are two sorts of members: to wit, dead and liuing. They are dead members, who with the outward assem∣blie of the Church, & visible congregation make confessi∣on of their faith, but yet are void of ye spirit of faith: such are Heretikes, Hypocrites, & carnall Gospellers. The li∣uing or liuelie members are they, which being indued wt a liuelie faith walke not after the flesh, but after the spi∣rit, whereby they are lead to be briefe, whosoeuer do sin∣cerelie liue in Christianitie, they are the liuelie members of Christ As for the Turkes, vnbeléeuing Iewes, & other Heathenish hearted people, they all are to be reputed & thought neither liuelie nor dead members of the Church. Moreouer, when the Apostle saith, (Euen the fulnes of him, that filleth all in all things,) he sheweth why he cal∣leth the Church (The bodie of Christ:) and therewithall declareth, how great the loue of Christ is towards his Church: which he calleth (The fulnesse of himselfe.) For, such is ye loue of Christ towards his Church, that althogh he perfourme all healthfull things in all men: yet not∣withstanding, he thinketh himselfe a head halt & lame, vn∣lesse he haue ye Church as his bodie knit vnto him. Héere∣vpon it followeth, that Christ is oftentimes taken for the whole Church together, ioined vnto hir head, as when it is said:1. Cor. 12. 12. &. 13. Sicut enim vnum corpus, &c. For as the bodie is one, & hath many members, & all the members of the bo∣die, which is one, though they be manie, yet are but one body: euen so Christ. For by one spirit are we all baptised into one bodie: that is, that we might be made one bodie with Christ, that we might grow into one body of Christ, that ye whole church might be nothing els but one Christ: of which growing together, Baptisme & the Lords supper are effectuall signes. Héerevnto serueth the saieng of the Apostle, Abrahae dictae sunt, &c. To Abraham and his seede were the promises made.Gal. 3. 16. He saith not, And to the seedes, as speaking of manie: but, And to thy seede, as of one, which is Christ. Héere the Apostle calleth Christ.
(The whole bodie gathered together in one,) whose head and life Christ alone is: the members of whom are the faithfull, being partlie Iewes, and partlie Gentiles. This he concludeth in the ende of the Chapter more plainlie in these words,Gal. 3. 28. Omnes vos, &c. Ye are all one in Christ Iesus. Héerehence had these manner of spea∣ches their vse and custome, To be made one with Christ, To be with Christ, Christ to be in vs, To be lead by the spirit of Christ, To be chosen in Christ, To be cal∣led & iustified in Christ, To liue in Christ, To die with Christ, To be crucified, buried, and rise againe with Christ. Héereto also serueth that which followeth in the third Chapter following,Ephes. 3. 6. That the Gospell was prea∣ched and reuealed to the Gentiles, that they should be inheritours also, and of the same bodie, and partakers of the promise in Christ. Héerevnto also perteineth the words of Saint Paule to the Galathians,Gal. 2. 20. where he saith, That he liueth in Christ, and Christ in him. And to this also belongeth that speach of Christ:Actes. 9. 4. Saule, Saule, why persecutest thou me? Now, what haue the faithfull to gather héereby? Euen to build their hope and comfort vpon this, that Christ cannot perish, of whom they are members by faith. Héer∣by also haue the faithfull to succour & strengthen them∣selues, in life, in death, and euerie daunger: bicause they are assured that the time will come, when Christ shalbe glorified with his whole bodie: howsoeuer his members amidst the hurlie burlies of this world be con∣temned, and spitefullie ouertroden. But to the end we may knowe, that Christ of himselfe néedeth not this ful∣nesse, the Apostle addeth, (That filleth all, in all things.) For indéed, if Christ filleth and perfourmeth all in all things, then doubtles he standeth not in need of anie mans helpe hérein towards this fulnesse: but so far forth as it pleaseth him, of his vnmeasurable & bottomles bountie, to vouchsafe ye Church to be ioined vnto him, as if it were
his bodie. This place likewise containeth a plentifull testimonie touching Christs Godhead. For séeing it doth properlie belong to the nature of God, (To fill all in all things:) & seing this abilitie is héere ascribed vnto Christ, That he filleth all in all things:) it followeth, that Christ is true God, and in person infinite and eternall. It is therefore well said in the Church: Christ is all in all euerie where, Christ filleth all in all, The sonne of the virgin is God. For these titles are right wel applied to his person, in respect of the nature of his Godhead, not in respect of the nature of his manhood, which hath his pe∣culiar properties, the taking awaie wherof, is the taking awaie of the truth of Christs manhood, & the ouerthrow∣ing of the hope of our resurrection. Wherefore that sai∣eng of S. Paule to the Philippians is throughly to be set∣led in memorie,Phil. 3. 21. Nostra corpora, &c. That our vile bodies shall be changed, and fashioned like vnto Christs glori∣ous bodie. Now, if Christs manhood were turned into his God∣head (as in times past the Eutychians wickedlie main∣tained, and at this daie Stenkfield traiterouslie teach∣eth,) there should remaine for vs no hope at all of our re∣surrection. Let this suffice to be spoken of this part or parcell, wherein Saint Paule setteth foorth the principall points of our faith concerning Christ, and verie brieflie commendeth vnto vs the fruite of them therewithall. ¶OF PREDESTI∣NATION. NOw, forsomuch as there is often mention made of Predestination & Election to euerlasting life, in this Chapter, it séemeth a necessarie labour vnto me, to adde héervnto certaine assertions or auouchments, which shall containe in them the sum of the doctrine touching Pre∣destination: which I haue done, to this purpose, that this
doctrine, which is the ground worke of our saluation, may be the more manifest, and the thinking therevpon swéete and comfortable to the godlie Reader, when the circumstances of the same are dulie considered. I. It is verie néedfull, that the Church be instructed and taught throughlie, concerning the eternall Predestination and Election of men to the blisfull & euerlasting life. For as no doctrine can minister comfort more abundantlie, to true Christian consciences, than the doctrine of Pre∣destination rightlie declared: so, nothing is more daunge∣rous, than to swarue and straie from the true meane and manner of Predestination. II. Wherefore, to the end we may not swarue and straie from the meane and manner of Predestination & Electi∣on, which the Scripture commendeth vnto vs, there must good héede be taken. For whosoeuer ouershooteth & mis∣seth the marke thereof, hée is carried into a perillous breaknecke, whereout he cannot recouer himselfe, except he haue succour from heauen. III. Some there are, which when they heare, that our sal∣uation standeth vpon the purpose & Election of God, neg∣lecting the true meane and manner thereof, imagine to themselues certaine dreames of the Stokes, & tables of destinie: wherewith they both intangle themselues mise∣rablie, and leade others out of the waie daungerouslie. IIII. For it cannot otherwise be, but that hée which imagi∣neth bookes of destinie & lucke, whereby to learne & know who shall be saued, & who damned, either swelleth with vaine hypocrisie, or pineth away with dedlie desperation.
V. For some, laieng fast holde vpon a certaine kinde of fleshlie carelesnesse, run headlong with full libertie into all kinde of mischiefe and villanie: to themselues vndoub∣ted destruction, to others a grieuous offense. VI. Othersome are carried into a contrarie euill: who, whiles they dreame of a particular promise of grace, a∣gainst the word of God, they are plunged ouer head and eares, into the bottomlesse pit of despaire: wherein they must néeds be cast alwaie for euer, vnlesse the right hand of God, raising them vp in time, they earnestlie repent. VII. Wherefore, séeing that we heare the mysterie of Pre∣destination commended vnto vs in the word of God: it be∣houeth vs to séeke the meane, the manner, & true cause therof in ye Oracle or word of God likewise: which if we haue once rightlie learned, it shall fill vs with ercéeding great comfort, & shall be vnto vs not onlie a spur to prick vs forward to all exercises of godlinesse, but also an assu∣red anchor, wherevppon to staie, euen at the pointe of death. VIII. Now, the meane and manner of Predestination is most true,Ephe. 1. 4. which S. Paule sheweth vnto, vs, when he writeth thus to the Ephesians, (Elegit, &c. He hath chosen vs in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that wee should be holie,Ephe. 1. 5. & without blame before him in loue.) Againe, (Praedestinauit nos, &c. He hath predestinated vs, to be adopted, through Iesus Christ, vnto himselfe.) Againe,Ephe. 1. 6. 7. (Gratos nos, &c. He hath made vs accepted in his beloued, by whom we haue redemption throgh his bloud.Ephe. 1. 9. 10. (Againe, Proposuit, &c. Hee hath purposed to gather together in one,Ephe. 1. 11. 12. all things in Christ.) Againe, (In quo, &c. In whom also wee are chosen, when wee were predestinate, according to the purpose of him,
which worketh all things, after the counsell of his owne will, that we which first trusted in Christ, should be vn∣to the praise of his glorie:)Ephe. 1. 13 14. Againe, (In quo, &c. In whom also ye haue trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, euen the Gospell of your saluation, wherein also, after that ye beleeued, ye were sealed with the holie spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our in∣heritaunce.) IX. Heere Saint Paule most plainlie declareth the meane and manner of our Predestination, whiles he saith, that God hath predestinate vs to saluation by and in Christ. By Christ, as our mediatour and redéemer. In Christ, as in and with our head: whose members we are made by faith, which the Gospell preacheth vnto all people and persons indifferentlie. X. God therefore hath predestinate vs, not by regi∣string our names in bookes of destinie and fortune, as Zeno and his schollers doted: but by appointing and or∣deining an assured meane and manner of saluation by and in Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will. XI. In this meane and manner the condition of faith is contained. For, when we are graffed into Christ by faith, we are made members of his bodie: and therefore are wée called (Elect and chosen) bicause we are the mem∣bers of Christ. XII. Now, how necessarie this condition is, by Gods good appointment, the testimonies are many which declare it. S. Paule reasoning of Predestination,Rom. 9. 30 31. 32. beateth much vpon this condition, saieng: Quid igitur dicemus? &c. What shall wee saie then? That the Gentiles which followed
not righteousnesse, haue attained vnto righteousnesse, euen the righteousnesse which is of faith? But Israel. which followed the lawe of righteousnesse, could not attaine vnto the lawe of righteousnesse. Wherefore? Be∣cause they sought it not by faith, but as it were, by the workes of the lawe.Rom. 10. 2 &c. This condition likewise the Apo∣stle rehearseth in the tenth Chapter of the same Epistle, and laboureth verie much thereabout also elsewhere:Coloss. 1. 23. as,Heb. 3. 6. Si modo, &c. If ye continue grounded and stablished in the faith:1. Tim. 2. 15. Also, Participes, &c. Whose house we are, if we holde fast the confidence, and the receiuing of the hope vnto the end: Againe, Mulier, &c. The woman shall be saued, if she continue in the faith. XIII. The Apostle sheweth the necessitie of this condition, in his owne person,1. Cor. 9. 16. thus speaking of himselfe. Vae mihi, &c. Woe is me if I preach not the Gospell. Againe, Ca∣stigo,1. Cor. 9. 27. &c. I chastise my bodie, and bring it downe in subiection, least while I preach to other, I my selfe proue a castawaie. If therefore S. Paule, the chosen vessell of God, duetifullie discharged his obedience towards God by faith, then (no doubt) through the want of faith he had fallen from grace, and through his owne default, become a castawaie. To the same end driue the words of the Prophet leremie, in the person of the Lord, saieng: Si poe∣nitentiam egerit,Iere. 18. 8. 10. &c. But if this nation, against whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickednesse, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring vpon them. But if it doe euill in my sight, and heare not my voice, I will repent of the good that I thought to do for them. XIIII. Héereby plainlie appeareth, that Gods predestination is ratified & confirmed by & in Christ: and that therefore it requireth at our hands the condition of faith, whereby
wée are graffed into Christ, and so numbered among the chosen. XV. Vpon the things which we haue hetherto spoken,What Pre¦destinati∣on is. let vs make this definition of Predestination: Predestinati∣on is the ordinance of God, whereby he hath appointed by and in Christ, before the foundation of the world was laide, according to his good pleasure, and the counsell or purpose of his will, all such to life euerlasting, as should beleeue in Christ their redeemer, that they might be ho∣lie and blamelesse before him, & that they might mag∣nifie the praise of the glorie of his grace, for euer & euer world without end. The opposite or contrarie to Prede∣stination, is Reprobation, whereby so manie as care not for beléeuing in Christ, & so manie as continue not in the faith of Christ to their liues end, are cut off from grace, banished from euerlasting life, and like bondslaues con∣demned to perpetuall paines. The cause of this reproba∣tion is the sin of men, & the iustice of God punishing of∣fenders, which foreslowe to flée for succour to the mercie seate, which God hath vouchsafed to set before men, in open sight. XVI. Furthermore, when we require the condition of faith, we do therewithall reproue Pharisaicall errour, touching the worthinesse of persons, the prerogatiue of flesh, the merits of mens works, &c. Wherevpon this al∣so followeth, That we must not iudge of this great my∣sterie, either after reason, or according to the law. For, as reason séemeth to make the worthinesse of persons, & the prerogatiue of flesh, the cause of election: so the law like∣wise séemeth vnto Hypocrites, (but yet amisse) to make the merits of works the cause of election. XVII. The cause therefore of our predestination is not in vs, as the Monks thought, who were farre wide, but in God:
which cause the Apostle calleth (,Ephe. 1. 5. voluntas Dei, The good pleasure of Gods will,) And S. Augu∣stine, Misericordissimam Dei voluntatem, The most mercifull will of God. Of this will of God toward men, when we are well warranted, & certeinlie assured, then haue we an vnmouable foundation of our predestination. For (God worketh all things,Ephe. 1. 11 after the counsell of his owne will,) as Saint Paule witnesseth. XVIII. The most mercifull will of God, is not vnknowne, or hidden from vs: but deliuered & opened by the voice or sound of the Gospell: & in foure things chieflie it is to be seene: namelie, In the sending of his son, In the promise, In the commandement, and In the sealing of grace. XIX. This sending of the sonne, is a substantiall testimonie of Gods fatherlie will towards vs, according to this sai∣eng of the son:Iohn. 3. 16 Sic Deus, &c. So God loued the world, that he gaue his onelie begotten sonne,1. Ioh. 4. 9 that as manie as beleeue in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life.Rom. 5. 8. And againe, Commendat Deus, &c. God setteth out his loue towards vs, seeing that whiles we were yet sin∣ners, Christ died for vs. The price therfore which he paid downe, is a sufficient amends for the misdéedes of the world. For the Father himselfe confesseth, That in his sonne he is well pleased,Mat. 17. 5 and biddeth vs boldlie heare him. XX. No man hath to thinke, that the sonne was sent in∣to the world, to redéeme a certaine number, put a part from the rest of mankind onlie: but rather, to take awaie the sins of the whole world, according to that saieng: Ec∣ce agnus,Iohn. 1. 29 36. &c. Behold the lambe of God, which taketh a∣way the sins of the world. For, as he toke vpon him ye na∣ture
common to vs all, so with our nature, he tooke like∣wise our cause. For so he saith openlie of himselfe, Filius hominis,Math. 18. 11. &c. The sonne of man came to saue that which was lost. Now, there were not a few handfuls of mankind lost, but all mankinde, one with an other. As therefore in Adam we all fell:1. Cor. 15. 22. so the promise of the seede which should bruse the serpents head, is giuen to all Adams of∣spring.1. Ioh. 3. 8. Héerevpon saith S. Iohn, Christus apparuit, &c. Christ appeared, to destroie the works of the Deuill. Wherfore (as S. Paule saith,1. Tim. 1. 15.) Fidelis hic sermo, &c. This is a true saieng, & by all meanes, worthie to be receiued, that Christ Iesus came into the world to saue sinners. XXI. Now, in that the successe (the more pitie) is not answe∣rable to the fathers will, who sent his sonne: nor to the desire of the sonne, who suffered punishment for mans sinne: that proceedeth from their own malice & wilfulnes: for that they béeing bidden of a most mercifull & gentle father, to the mariage of his best beloued sonne, & might be welcome guests, cared not for comming, but vnthank∣fullie set at naught his kindnes: as Christ himselfe com∣plaineth,Math. 20. 16, &. 22. 14. saieng: Multi sunt vocati, &c. Manie are called, but few are chosen: that is to saie, Few beléeue & bring foorth fruits worthie of repentaunce. This is the cause why they are shut out of the Bridehouse, as guests not garnished with a wedding garment. XXII. THE PROMISE OF GRACE, which in déede stretcheth vnto all, doth likewise commend vnto vs the most mercifull will of our heauenlie father. Heer∣vnto serue manie saiengs, & among the rest these which followe. Haec est voluntas, &c. This is the will of my Father,Iohn. 6. 40 which sent mee, that (all) which see the sonne, & beleeue in him,Mat. 18. 14. should haue life euerlasting. Againe, Sic non est, &c. So is it not the will of your Father which
is in heauen, that (one) of these little ones should perish. Againe,1. Tim. 2. 4 Deus vult, &c. It is the will of God, that (all) should be saued,2. Pet. 3. 9. and come vnto the knowledge of the truth.Ezek. 18. 23. 32. Againe, Deus longanimis, &c. God is patient and long suffering towards vs, and would haue (no man) to perish, but would (all men) to come to repentaunce. To this also perteineth that place of the Prophet, Nolo mortem, &c. I will not the death of a sinner: but that he repent and liue. Héerevpon saith Saint Barnard, Pro∣dit in lucem, &c. The great counsell, which from the e∣uerlasting, laie hid in the bosome of euerlastingnesse, is come abroad in light, for the comfort of the miserable and distressed: bicause God will not the death of a sin∣ner, but rather that he should repent and liue. XXIII. This promise of grace, as it reacheth vnto all, so is it also fréelie giuen, and is to be receiued by faith alone. The Apostle most plainlie auoucheth both, in the 9. 10. & 11. Chapters of his Epistle to the Romanes: where he aloweth no place at all to the prerogatiue of the flesh,Esai. 28. 16 nor to the merits of workes,Ioel. 2. 32. & concludeth, that (Whosoe∣uer beleeueth,Actes. 2. 21 shall not be put to shame. For (saith he) there is no difference of the Iew and the Gentile.Rom. 10. 11. 12. For the same Lord of all,Rom. 9. 33 is rich vnto all that call vpon him. XXIIII. Héereto serue those notable figures, which the same Apostle setteth foorth, when he bringeth in Ismael and Isaach, the two sonnes of Abraham: and Iacob and Esau, the two sonnes of Isaach. Which figures are thus to be applied. In assured blessings and benefits belonging to this life, not all which are borne of Abrahams & Isaachs séede, are counted their children: much lesse in spirituall things shall they be taken for their children, which come of the loines of these holie Fathers. Wherefore, as in
the blessings or benefits belonging to this life, they one∣lie are reputed the children of the holie Patriarches, con∣cerning whom they had promises: (as Abraham of Isa∣ach, and not of Ismael: Isaach of Iacob, and not of Esau:) euen so in spirituall things, they onelie are to be accoun∣ted Abrahams children, which beléeue in the frée promise, and not they which swell and are proud of the preroga∣tiue of the flesh. XXV. As for the Apostles conclusion, it hath none other mea∣ning:Rom. 9. 16 Non est igitur, &c, It is not therefore in him which willeth, nor in him which runneth, but in God which hath mercie. Of which conclusion, this is the true and perfect meaning without doubt. It is not in him which willeth, nor in him which runneth, to wit, according to the flesh: because the will of the flesh, and the running of the flesh, staie vpon the prerogatiue of the flesh, and the merits of workes: and therefore they are flat against the mercie of God, and the merite of Christ. But it is in him that willeth, and in him that runneth, according to the promise, that is to say, of him which beleueth: bicause, All things are possible to him that beleeueth.Mark. 9. 23 For this will, and this running commend the mercie of God, & rest one∣lie vpon the mercie promised in Christ. What followeth héerevpon? Euen that which the Apostle hath set downe: namelie, That the children of the promise, and not the children of the flesh are heires. XXVI. Now, who are the children of the promise? Forsooth, as manie as beléeue in the promise, as Abraham did be∣léeue. For the Apostle nameth them the children of the promise,Rom. 4. 12 Qui insistunt; &c. Which walke in the steps of Abrahams faith. And he saith yet againe, Scitote, &c. Knowe you therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.Gal. 3. 7. If they be children, then are they also heires, according to the promise.
XXVII. They which denie this grace of God reaching vnto all, (so much as belongeth to the fatherlie will of God,) besides that they set themselues against Saint Paule, and heaue and shoue to shake in sunder the consent of the whole scripture, they offend most grieuouslie otherwise. For, first of all, they make God a respecter of persons: & againe, they imagine in God two contrarie willes. XXVIII. But that God is no respecter of persons, there are manie places of scripture which giue manifest proofe. For God doth alwaies allow the good cause, & euermore con∣demneth the euill cause: according to this rule, Fideles, &c.Psa. 31. 23 The Lord keepeth the faithfull, as for the proud, he will paie them their hire. Nothing therfore is more cer∣teine, than that God receiueth the repentaunt to grace and fauour: contrariwise, that he giueth ouer the vnre∣pentaunt, setting apart all respect of persons. XXIX. Now,Tvvo faithfull persons, the one a beggar, the other a Lord. &c. whereas it pleased Gods will, that Lazarus should begge, & that Ioseph should be a Lord or Prince in Aegypt: this doth not proue that God hath anie re∣spect of persons. For the hauing of respect of persons hath place in iudgements, where equall things are giuen to vnequall persons: and vnequall things to equall per∣sons. Now, séeing that God reckoneth still vpon this rule of iudgement, That he would saue (all) that beléeue in Christ, and punish with euerlasting paines, (all) such as set light by his sonne, and lie soaking in their sinnes, there is (I thinke) no respect of persons in God. XXX. Furthermore, that there are not in God cōtrarie wils, héereby it is manifest: bicause, as he is most true: yea,
euen truth it selfe, so he cannot away with a double heart, but vtterlie condemneth it. Whereas therefore it is thus written, God will that (all men) be saued: Againe, God will that (none) perish, but that (all) repent: the contra∣dictories of these propositions, are at no hand to be allow∣ed, which are these: God will that (not all men) be saued: God will that (some) perish, and that (not all) repent. XXXI. How then commeth it to passe (thou wilt saie) that manie are damned, seing God will haue (all) saued? If we haue an eie to the purpose of God in our creation, and of sending his sonne into the world, then we shall sée indeed that the will of God is, that (none) should perish. But if we looke againe to the euent or successe, we shall sée that the will of God is, that (all) vnrepentant, (all) wilfull, stubborne, and maliciouslie minded persons shall perish. An earthlie father would gladlie haue all his children inherite: for this is the true fatherlie loue in a good father after the flesh. But if he perceiue anie of his children so froward, vnrulie, disordered, & disobedient, that neither rebukes with words, nor the smart of the whip, or such like sharpe correction will make him amend, the wise father putteth him by his inheritaunce, and recko∣neth him no more in the number of his children. XXXII. Of this thing we haue a paterne before vs in Deu∣teronomie,Deut. 21. 18. 19. 20. 21. where the Lord saith thus: Si genueris, &c. If anie man haue a sonne that is stubborne and dis∣obedient, which will not hearken vnto the voice of his father, nor the voice of his mother, and they haue chastened him, and he would not obeie them: Then shall his father and his mother take him, and bring him out vnto the Elders of his citie, and vnto the gate of the place where he dwelleth, and shall saie vnto the Elders
of his citie: Filius noster iste, &c. This our sonne is stub∣borne and disobedient, and he will not obeie our admo∣nition: he is a riottour, and a drunkard. Then all the men of his citie shall take him, & stone him with stones vnto death, &c. Will not the Father heere haue his sonne stoned with stones euen to death, though nature should moue him fatherlie to loue him? After the same manner dealeth God. For God, of his fatherlie goodnesse, would haue (all) made heires of euerlasting life: but yet not∣withstanding, he hath appointed the stubborne and obsti∣nate their portion, euen perpetuall punishment. XXXIII. Wherefore we must héedefullie make a difference be∣tweene the fatherlie will of God, which the Diuines call, (Antecedent: that is, going before,) and that will of his which followeth the wilfull stubbornesse of men, which is also called (Consequent: that is, following after.) XXXIIII. The commaundement (for this is the third thing, wherein we haue set foorth the will of God towards all men) commendeth likewise vnto vs, the true fatherlie will of God towards all. For it cannot be, that the will of God should wrestle with his commandement. Where∣fore, when he biddeth the whole world heare his sonne, his will doubtlesse is, that all should heare him, & his will is by hearing they should haue faith. For the preaching of the Gospell requireth saith. Gods will also is, that such as beléeue should be saued. Besides this, the sonne, who is the wisedome of his Father, sendeth out his Disciples throughout the whole world, with this commandement, Ite in mundum,Luke. 16. 15. 16. &c. Goe ye into all the world, & preach the Gospell vnto (euery creature.) He that shall beleeue and be baptised, shall be saued: but he that will not be∣leeue, shall be damned. This commandement, forsomuch
as it reacheth vnto all, plainlie proueth, that Gods will is to haue (all men) saued: but yet vpon the condition of faith, as the promise ioined to the commandement decla∣reth. The Lord straineth his voice, crieng: Venite, &c. Come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden,Math. 11. 28. and I will ease you. Héere doe both: namelie, the commande∣ment and the promise testifie, that the will of God is fa∣therlie, that (all) should come to Christ calling them, and that (all) should obtaine in him their saluation. XXXV. This therefore is boldlie and vndoubtedlie to be built vpon, that the eternall and vniuersall commandement of God, is an vndeceiuable witnesse of his will towardes all men. Séeing therefore he commandeth all to heare his sonne, and to beléeue in him: his will surelie is there∣after, that all should heare, that all should beléeue, that all should be iustified, that all should be sanctified, and that all should be saued. Be it farre from a Christian heart to thinke, that God forgiueth all men outwardlie and in words: and hath an other will and secret meaning of his owne inwardlie. XXXVI. But one or other will saie peraduenture: Faith is the gift of God, and the worke of the holie Ghost: Ergo, no man can beléeue, but he which receiueth faith from a∣boue.Ioh. 6. 44. Againe, No man commeth to the sonne, vnlesse the Father drawe him. This (I graunt) is verie true. But when Saint Paule saith, Faith commeth by hea∣ring,Rom. 10. 17. and hearing by the word of God, he meaneth that the preaching of the Gospell is the ordinarie instru∣ment to obteine faith: wherein God (according to his promises) will be faithfull and effectuall, & will drawe and knit vs vnto his sonne by the word and the spirit.
But manie, when God draweth them, set shoulder a∣gainst him, whom they maie as well (I wisse) obeie. This is plainlie proued by the complaint of Christ, la∣menting and wéeping ouer the Iewes,Math. 23. 37. for their froward∣nesse: Quoties volui, &c. How often would I haue gathered thee together,Luke. 13. 35. as the henne gathereth her chic∣kens, and thou wouldest not? The like stubbornesse, and wilfull obstinacie, Saint Stephen casteth in the téeth of the Iewes in his time,Act. 7. 51 saieng: Duri ceuice, &c. Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised hearts and eares, ye haue alwaies resisted the holie Ghost. And the Lord by his Prophet Esaie saith,Esaie. 56. 2. 3. &c. Tota die, &c. I haue stret∣ched out my hands all the daie long, to a stubborne people that haue resisted me.Actes. 13. 45. 46. 47. By this selfe same te∣stimonie of authoritie, Saint Paule sheweth the rebel∣lion of the Iewes, which he proueth to be the cause of their casting off. And although our minde, whiles it is enlightened, prepared, altered, chaunged, dis∣posed and ordered, is the patient or sufferer: yet notwithstanding, in respect of consent and agréement, our will being taught by the word, and strengthe∣ned by the holie spirit, is the agent also or dooer. XXXVII. Héerevnto serueth the example which Saint Au∣gustine setteth downe, of Nabuchodonosor and Pha∣rao, in these words: Quantum ad, &c. In respect of their nature, they were both men: in respect of their dignitie, both Kings: in respect of their cause, both keepers of Gods people in captiuitie: in respect of their punishment, both gentlie admonished and warned by chastisements. What then made their en∣dings diuerse? Forsooth this, because the one feeling Gods hand, mourned in the remembrance of his owne sinne and iniquitie: the other wrestled with free will
against the most mercifull good pleasure of God. XXXVIII. But héere speciall héede must be taken, least anie through wantonnesse and long custome of sinning, abu∣sing the gentlenesse and long suffering of God, calling them to repentaunce, purchase vnto themselues Gods heauie iudgement that in his wrath he forsake them, and giue them ouer into a reprobate minde. When this is come to passe, men waxe deafe, and hard of hearing the word of God, drawing to themselues such a vse and ne∣cessitie of sinning, by their owne will, that they can doe nothing else but sinne. For it fareth with them, as with him, that pitcheth himselfe headlong from the toppe of a stéepe hill, which deede being once done, there is no calling of it backe againe, because it is past recouerie. XXXIX. We must therefore in time obeie the voice of God calling vs, we must repent and walke warilie (as the Prophet giueth vs counsell) before our God. For, he that refuseth to heare God, calling vs by his ministers, run∣neth with full raine, into the punishment of wilfull ob∣stinacie: wherevpon followeth, that he, being more and more fast bound with the chaines of sinne, till at length he become senselesse and sorowlesse, and so turne topsie torue all the meanes of saluation. Heere therefore that common verse hath fit place: If thou to daie vnmeete be thought, To morrowe doubtlesse much more nought. XL. The sealing of grace commendeth vnto vs most ma∣nifestlie, the fatherlie will of God: for this followeth in the fourth place among those markes & tokens, which set before our eies, how fatherlie the will of God is towards all men. For, whiles he biddeth (all nations) to be bapti∣sed,
hée will also (no doubt) that his grace and most mercifull will be sealed vnto (all nations.) For he would neuer call (all nations) to Baptisme, but that his will is to giue saluation to (all nations) which he sealeth with Bap∣tisme. For this is an vnmouable sequele. God offereth saluation vnto (all:) Ergo his will is that (all) be saued. XLI. Now in that Baptisme is but onelie literall in manie, this commeth not to passe by the counsell & will of God, who giueth his grace truelie, and sealeth the same in déede by Baptisme: but through the default of men, who shrinke shamefullie from the couenaunt which they made with God in Baptisme. XLII. For, as God promiseth, and sealeth his promise with Baptisme: so it is méete that man, on the other side, haue faith in this behalfe. For, in euerie couenant, either par∣tie must and shall kéepe the conditions and appointments of the couenant. And for that cause S. Peter defineth it, A good conscience making request to God.1. Pet.  21. For God in gi∣uing Baptisme, promiseth grace: now, a conscience in faith agréeable, resteth vpon the couenant, béeing well as∣sured of Iesus Christs resurrection. XLIII. Séeing therefore these proofes doe most plainlie laie before vs the fatherlie will of God, which is the cause & groundworke of our Predestination & election, requisite it is that we haue a stedfast beliefe of our saluation, and that we betake our selues to the fatherlie will of God (as to a most strong & well fensed tower) expressed & shewed vnto vs, In the sending of his sonne, In the promise, I the commaundement, and in the sealing of grace: not passing a point for the opinions & decrées of the Stoikes, touching Fortune or destinie, though they haue iollie wise fellowes for their maintainers.
XLIIII. Furthermore, Saint Paule maketh two endes of our predestination & election, writing to the Ephesians: wher∣of the first is, (That we should bee holie, and without blame before him, that is to saie, that wée should giue our selues to holinesse & harmelesnesse, & should alwaies haue before vs a good minde, purpose, and honest ende∣uour: the last, (That the glorie of his grace might bee praised of vs for euer.) XLV. It remaineth now, that wée speake somewhat of the vse of the most swéete doctrine of Predestination and E∣lection, which is of two sortes, as maie be gathered out of Saint Paules Epistles to the Romanes & Ephesians. The Apostle therefore writeth to the Romanes concer∣ning Predestination, that hee might conclude out of the cause, the manner & meane, and the condition also of Pre∣destination, that the prerogatiue of the flesh; & mans me∣rits, are no kinde of cause of saluation. The Apostle ther∣fore ouerthroweth the prerogatiue of the flesh, & all me∣rits of men, that the mercie of God in Christ Iesus, might take place, and that a waie of saluation maie bée made vnto all such as refuse not to beléeue in Christ. In his E∣pistle to the Ephesians, he hath the same matter in hand, to the end he might shew, that the Gospell of Christ, is no new vpstart doctrine, set abroch of the Apostles: but that the same was laid vp and kept in the bosome of God himselfe, before the world was made, and in due time opened and deliuered to the world. XLVI. Besides this double vse; whereof the first serueth to confirme righteousnesse fréelie giuen, and grace stretched out & offered vnto all: the last, to commend the ancient∣nesse of the Gospell: there is yet an other vse, (which
Saint Paule toucheth in his Epistle to the Romans) That the godlie maie be bolde,Rom. 8. 33 34. 35. &c. that no crosse, no affliction, no miserie: to bee short, nothing whatsoeuer is able to hinder or let the saluation of the beleeuers, which is buil∣ded vpon the eternall ordinance of God. XLVII. From hence springeth an excéeding greate comfort in the agonie of death, and an vnspeakable reioising: inso∣much, that the partie which lieth gasping, and drawing to his long home, maie saie, as it were in triumph: In Do∣mino, &c.Psal. 57. 10 My soule trusteth in the Lord, I will not be afraide. My Christ is the vanquisher of death, in him will I triumph. XLVIIII. Héerevnto serueth that saieng of the Prophet Dauid,Psal. 27. 14. Vriliter agite, &c. I laie the men, bee constant, and let the hearts of all you,Psal. 31. 23, &. 24 which hope in the Lord, bee strengthened. For the Lord keepeth all them that loue him. XLIX. To staie héere: this vse which confirmeth vs in anie kinde of crosse, and comforteth vs in the agonie of death, then indéede entereth his roome, when we feele that wée are in Christ, and that Christ is in vs. L. Wherefore, according to Saint Paules aduise, we must take a triall of our selues, Vos ipsos tentate, &c. Prooue your selues (saith he) whether ye are in the faith:2. Cor. 13. 5. examine your selues. Knowe you not your owne selues, how that Iesus Christ is in you? LI. These words of the Apostle teach vs a most certaine and assured manner of trieng our selues, which is,
to proue and examine, whether we are in the faith, & whe∣ther Christ dwelleth in vs. Which prouing doubtlesse) cannot from elsewhere proceede, than from the effects and working of Christs spirit. For they that are lead by Christs spirit, are his: and they that are lead by Christs spirit, thinke, loue, followe, and excercise in life, the things that are of Christ, esteeming nothing more precious, than so to order and frame their liues, as that God should like well and allow of them. Héerevpon ariseth that sharpe combat of the spirit against the flesh, neuer ceassing in the godlie. LII. To this also belongeth the saieng of Saint Paule,1. Tim. 1. 18. 19. Milita, &c. Fight a good fight, keepe the faith, and a good conscience. For these are most assured testimonies that Christ dwelleth in vs. For Where faith is, there the conscience is cleansed from all dead works. Wherefore, both a good conscience, and a godlie purpose are vndoub∣ted warrants of a sincere faith. Contrariwise, where the conscience is béesmeared with sinne, and an euill purpose of dooing amisse, there is no faith at all, but a kinde of Hypocriticall bragging of faith peraduenture, which to bee most vaine and foolish, the workes themselues springing from the same, doe sufficientlie de∣clare, and Saint Iames also saith no lesse.
¶THE SECOND CHAPTER. THE SVMME OF THE SE∣cond Chapter. IT pleased God to quicken and make aliue in Christ, by grace through faith, not the Iewes onelie, a people dead to sinne, and the children of wrath: but also the Gentiles, which in times past were not of Gods housholde: taking away all difference betwixt the Iewes and the Gentiles, and making peace betwixt them both: which he hath done to this end, that he might shew vnto all ages and posterities his plentifull and euerlasting grace towards the faithfull, who are builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Christ béeing the corner stone. Or thus more brieflie: God vouchsafeth to take the Iewes and the Gentiles, great sinners, to grace and fauour, for his sonnes sake Christ Iesus. ¶THE ORDER OF THE SE∣cond Chapter. THe beginning of this Chapter doth fitlie agrée with the end of the Chapter going before. For the Apostle héere applieth a generall doctrine to the Iewes and the Gentiles: that is to saie, turneth ouer the generalitie, to the specialties. For, in this Chapter hée repeateth in particular, that which in the former Chapter hée sette downe in generall: howbeit, in an other forme and man∣ner of speach, for the more approuing of the matter, and giuing of it greater force. Now he vseth a comparison of the state of man, which is of two sortes: namelie, of the former, to wit, before grace: and of the latter: that is, vn∣der grace. Before grace, men were dead in their trāsgres∣sions and sins, vnder grace they were quickened & made aliue by Christ, through faith. This comparison first of
all, as in the proposition, he applieth vnto them both: af∣terwards, he turneth it both to the Iewes, and also to the Ephesians: adding therevnto a certaine short Aphoris∣me, wherein he laieth wide open the summe of saluation. Then he applieth the same comparison more at large to the Gentiles, vnder the name of the Ephesians: declaring how the Gentiles, who in times past were straungers from the Commonwelth of God, are made Citizens with the Saints, and of Gods houshold: all which is wrought by the crosse of Christ, the vertue and power whereof is made knowne vnto men, by the preaching of the Gos∣pell. Lastlie, he ioineth héerewithall a conclusion, with a notable enlargement. All these things tend wholie héere∣vnto, that the Ephesians might estéeme and thinke of the grace of the Gospell, according to the worthinesse therof, least they being made partakers of so heauenlie a myste∣rie, should vnaduisedlie fall awaie from it againe. ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE SE∣cond Chapter, with the obseruation of doc∣trines therein conteined. Verse. 1. &. 2. 1 And you hath he quickened, that vvere dead in trespasses and sinnes. 2 Wherein in time past, ye vval∣ked, according to the course of this vvorld, and after the Prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the spirit, that novv worketh in the children of disobedience. And you when you were dead in the trespasses and sinnes wherein you walked, according to the trade of this world, after the Prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the spirit, which now worketh in the chil∣dren of vnbeliefe. ALthough the wordes of this speach or sentence, stand out of order: yet notwith∣standing there is no disorder of matter. Wherfore, to the intent it maie be per∣fect and full, the Nominatiue case and the Verbe, must be fetcht out of the
words which followe, after this maner, (God the Father hath quickened you together with Christ, when you were dead in sinnes.) Now let vs weie the sentence well. In the ende of the former Chapter, the Apostle calleth Christ, (The head of the Church:) and héere he placeth the Ephesians vnder Christ the head, that they might ad∣uisedlie cōsider, to how great dignitie & glorie they are cal∣led, by the gospel. Now, yt this passing great benefit might become more sweet to the Ephesians, he setteth downe a comparison of a double state, common to the Iewes and the Ephesians, that is to saie, the Gentiles. The former state is of them both before their conuersion: the latter af∣ter their conuersion. Before their conuersion, S. Paule a∣uoucheth, that they both were dead in trespasses & sinnes. After their conuersion, hée saith, that they were dischar∣ged from the guiltinesse of their sinnes, and were quickened in Christ. By (Trespasses) vnderstand the beginnings as it were of sinnes: and by (Sinnes) the custome of sinning. And that the Ephesians were dead in trespasses and sinnes; before their conuersion, he pro∣ueth by two reasons. For, hée sendeth them both to experience or proofe, and also to the cause and Prince of all euill and mischiefe. Experience would not suf∣fer them to be ignorant, how defiled and vncleane they were (According to the course of the whole world,) bée∣ing indéede plunged ouer head and eares in the bottom∣lesse pit of sinnes. For (According to the course of this world,) signifieth the trade, fashion, custome, and vse of this worlde, which delighteth in nothing else but in sinnes. They are not said, in this place, (To bee dead in trespasses and sinnes) whose sinne iut out: but they whom sinne hath wounded & slaine, as guiltie before the iudgement seat of God. The Apostle speaketh of spiritu∣al death, which is a separation of Gods spirit & grace from man. From whence also yt death, which we call the first
death: to wit, the departing of the soule from the bo∣die: and the second death, which is death euerlasting doe procéede. Let vs now sée what doctrine is ministred vnto vs out of this place. First, we learne héerehence, that men destitute of Gods grace, can doe nothing else but sinne, in euerie thing that they take in hand. Secondlie, that Sathan hath full swaie in the children of vnbeliefe: that is to saie, in them which beléeue not the Gospell. Thirdlie, that the life and conuersation of men, is a testimonie and witnesse, by what spirit they are lead, whether by the spirit of God, or the spirit of the Diuell. Fourthlie, that such as beléeue in Christ, are set frée from the tyran∣nie of Sathan, that hée hath no power ouer them, to egge them, as hée list, to this sinne and that. There are two causes of sinnes noted héere, to wit, (The course of this world,) and (The Prince that ru∣leth in the aire.) But of these I will speake héereafter, when I shall ioine vnto these, other causes also, as the words of the Apostle shall moue me: to the end wée may haue all the causes of sinnes in the vnbeleeuers noted to∣gether; and so with the greater diligence take héede of them. Verse. 3. 3 Among vhom vve also had our conuersation in time past, in the lusts of our flesh, in ful∣filling the vvill of the flesh, and of the minde: and were by na∣ture the children of vvrath, as vvell as others. Among whom likewise all wee were sometimes conuersant, in the concupiscence of our flesh, dooing the will of the flesh, and of the minde, and we were by nature the children of wrath as well as others. THis is spoken by waie of application, and serueth to this end, that the Ephesians looking vpon the Iewes, as vpon a paterne or example, might hope well. For, sée∣ing ye Apostle saith, That the Iews were no lesse giuen to
the lewd lusts of the flesh, and vnto doing the will of their wicked thoughts, whereby they became the children of wrath, by the like corruption of nature which reigned in the rest, than the Ephesians or other Gentiles, and yet affirmeth that they were taken to grace, and receiued into fauour, it putteth the Ephesians in good hope & com∣fort, that they should be receiued into fauour also, and be saued, through the selfe same goodnesse of God. Héerehence let vs learne the vse of such examples as the holie scripture commendeth vnto vs. For they (to speake brieflie) besides the doctrine which is to be gathe∣red by them, set before our eies, Gods iudgement and his mercie, that we might be instructed and taught, ha∣uing such godlie examples of them both, in present view. (The lust of the flesh) is that, which springeth from the corruption and naughtinesse of the flesh, that is, of origi∣nall sinne. For héere this word (Flesh) signifieth the whole man not yet renewed. In the (Flesh) dwelleth (Lust,) whereby man is egged to do those things, which the flesh and the wicked thoughts of the same doe like. The Apo∣stle in this place séemeth to make two parts of a corrupt and naughtie nature, to wit: : that is to saie: the flesh, and the minde, or the vn∣derstanding part. By the first is meant that part of the minde, which the Philosophers call, , the ap∣petite, or desire, which is void of reason. By the last, that part which they name, , the reasonable part. Wherevpon it commeth to passe, that the whole man, be∣fore the grace of regeneration, is by nature, that is to say, not by custome and imitation, but by necessitie of birth & conception, after the fall of our first parents, the childe of wrath, that is to saie, by the iust iudgement of God, an∣grie and displeased with him, guiltie of euerlasting death, through sinne. For the childe of wrath is Passiuelie ta∣ken, and not Actiuelie. For, he is not héere said to be the
childe of wrath, which is angrie: but he which suffereth anger by desart, and therefore is appointed vnto punish∣ment. Also before, the childe of wilfulnesse and stubbor∣nesse is Actiuelie taken: for it signifieth one that is fro∣ward, malicious, disordered, and a wrestler against the word of God and his will. It is to be noted therfore, that this word Filius, Childe, ioined with Genitiue cases of Nownes appellatiues, is somtimes Actiuelie taken, that is to saie: signifies a man giuen to that propertie or quali∣tie, which by the Genitiue case is expressed: & other some∣times againe, it is Passiuelie taken, that is to saie, signifi∣eth him that is made subiect to suffer that thing which the Genitiue case declareth. In this place let vs first of all marke, how miserable our state and condition is without Christ. For, we are carried a maine into all kinde of sin and wickednesse, euen as the lust of the flesh moueth vs, & not onlie summoned, but also tried & found guiltie before Gods iudgement seate, as offenders deseruing the wrath of God, and eternall death. Let this thinking vpon our euill case admonish vs, how swéete the Lord is, and how comfortable his word, who by his grace deliuereth vs out of these daungers, and remoueth vs into his glori∣ous kingdome. Besides that we haue said, by this and the former part we maie gather the causes of sinnes bea∣ring full swaie in the world, which kéepe order in follow∣ing one another. The first is the flesh it selfe. Now this word (Flesh) is diuerslie taken in the Scripture. For, sometimes it hath a proper, and sometimes againe a figuratiue or borrowed meaning. When it is properlie taken, it sig∣nifieth the fleshie substance of liuing creatures: as when Saint Paule saith thus,1. Cor. 15. 39. Non omnis caro eadem, &c. All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birdes. It is figuratiuelie taken also, sometimes by the figure Synecdoche, and signifieth the
whole man,1. Cor. 1. 29. as in that place of Saint Paule, Vt non, &c. That all flesh maie not boast, that is to saie, man or anie other liuing creature: as in that place also of Genesis, Finis,Gen. 6. 13. &c. An ende of all flesh is come before me. Some∣times by the figure Metaphora: for as the flesh doeth properlie signifie, a thing sensible, which maie be fealt and séene: so Metaphoricallie it signifieth the outward shewe or appearaunce of things: as in that place, where it is said:Ioh. 8. 15. Vos iudicatis, &c. Ye iudge after the flesh. Some∣times by the figure Metalepsis: for, bicause the flesh is soft, it is otherwhiles taken for soft, and set against hard∣nesse: as in that saieng of the Lord, Auferam, &c. I will take from their flesh,Ezek. 11. 19. & cap. 36. 26 their stonie heart: and I will giue them a fleshie heart: that is to saie, a soft heart, not re∣sisting God, but beléeuing in the word of God. Some∣times by the figure Metonymia, for something to him be∣longing, and that diuerslie: otherwhiles for the iudge∣ment of reason,Math. 16. 17. as in that saieng, Caro & sanguis, &c. Flesh and bloud, hath not opened this vnto thee, that is to saie, by the iudgement of reason thou perceiuest not, that I am the Sonne of God, and the true Messias. Sometimes for the beginning of mans corrupt na∣ture: that is to saie, for originall sinne, as in Saint Paules Epistles euerie where maie be séene:Rom. 8. 6. : that is to saie, The wisedome of the flesh is death.Rom. 8. 13 Againe, Si secundum, &c. If ye liue af∣ter the flesh, ye shall die. And in that speach of the Lord, Quod natum est,Ioh. 3. 6. &c. That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh. And in this sense is the word (Flesh) taken, when we make it the first cause of sinnes, reigning and ruling among men. Against this is set, as it were flat contrarie, the spirit of the new borne: that is to saie, a motion or working, which the holie spi∣rit stirreth vp in the hearts of the beleeuers, which is the first cause of godlie purposes and exercises in men.
The second cause of sinnes swaieng in such sort, is the lust of the flesh, whereby the flesh, or originall sinne is made lustie & effectuall to bring foorth verie ill fruits. The force of this lust all men féele & trie in themselues. Against this is set, as flat contrarie, the lust of the spirit, which hath place onelie in the godlie, and in such as haue chaunged their copie by repentaunce: and this is the se∣cond cause of godlie purposes and exercises in the good. The third cause of trespasses and sinnes is the vnder∣standing, or (as Saint Paule saith) : that is, the minde: when the minde or vnderstanding being at∣tainted, & raised vp of lust, beginneth to talke and reason with it selfe of those things, wherevnto the lust mo∣ueth and pricketh it. Against this is set (as flat contra∣rie) the vnderstanding of the spirit. The fourth cause of sinnes and offenses is, the will of the flesh, and thoughts of the same: as Saint Paule saith. And although the will sometimes replieth vpon the reasoning of the flesh: yet notwithstanding, in them that are not new borne, it is violentlie caried away (yea verie often) with the force of the flesh: euen as a Pinnisse or small Barke is with contrarie windes and weather, though the mariners doe what they can for the safegard of the same. Héereto serueth the saieng of Medea: Lau∣do liora, &c. The better I allow as true, But yet the worst I will ensue. Against this will of the flesh, and the thoughts of the same, is set (as flat contrarie) the will of the spirit, commanding things, which the flesh can in no wise awaie with: and this is the fourth cause of godlie purposes and actions in the good. The fift cause of sinnes is, (as Saint Paule saith,) , The common course of this world: that is to saie, the peruerse and froward fashions of this
world, infinite offenses dailie giuen, and examples of most mischieuous déedes without number. This euill custome of the world, is a kinde of fodder & sustenaunce of sinne: wherewith manie among them that were minded to feare God, being fedde fat, ware wilde, and kicke vp the heele against him. Héerehence springeth this, that the e∣uill manners of parents, is ths euill bringing vp of their children. For, whiles men doe amisse, and liue after the manner of the multitude, they excuse themselues by ex∣ample, as they in olde time did, who setting good Noe at naught, were paid home at length, féeling in the floud due punishment for their disobedience. Against this froward and wilfull wicked world, maie be set (as flat contrarie) as well the examples of holie Angels, and other Gods good creatures in heauen: as also of Saints and holie peo∣ple, which estéemed nothing more pleasant, nothing more precious, and nothing better in their life, than to be obe∣dient vnto God by faith. The sixt cause of sins ouerrunning the world, is (The Prince that ruleth in the aire,)Psa. 109. 7 that is to saie the Diuell. For he,Math. 27. 4. 5. as the holie historie beareth witnesse of traite∣rous Iudas,Mark. 14. 21. 43. 44. 45. entreth into mens hearts, and pulleth them forward into diuers sinnes and offenses, that they should not be saued. Against him (as flat contrarie) maie be set the Prince that ruleth in the Church,Luke. 22. 22. 47. 48. Christ Ie∣sus, who giueth his holie spirit to them that aske it. And he is the first and chiefest author:Ioh. 17. 12. & Chap. 18. 3. 4. 5. &c. yea, the cause of cau∣ses of all godlie purposes and exercises whatsoeuer, in them that are turned, and become new creatures. Hetherto we haue shewed,Act. 1. 16 17. 18. &c. what be the causes of tres∣passes and sinnes ouerspreading the world, against all which, the onelie & souereigne remedie is Faith in Ie∣sus Christ.1. Ioh. 5. 4. This is the victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith. In this are conteined the causes of doing good déedes, which causes I haue alreadie rehear∣sed: in this is Christ the conquerour of the kingdome
of darkenesse possessed: in this we are made new men, and regenerated: by this a new spirit, wherewith we withstand the flesh, is obteined: finallie, by this the whole bodie of sinne is striken dead and mortified. Verses. 4. 5. 6. &. 7. 4 But God, vvhich is rich in mercie, through his great loue, vvherevvith he loued vs, 5 Euen vvhen vve vvere dead by sinnes, hath quickened vs together in Christ; by vvhose grace ye are saued, 6 And hath raised vs vp toge∣ther, & made vs sit together in the heauenlie places, in Christ Iesus, 7 That he might shew in the ages to come, the exceeding ri∣ches of his grace, through his kindnesse tovvards vs in Christ Iesus. But God, which is rich in mercie, for the great loue sake wherewith he loued vs, euen when we were dead by sinne, hath quickened vs together with Christ. (For by grace are ye saued) and hath made vs sit toge∣ther in heauenlie things in Christ Iesus, that he might shew in times to come, the abundant riches of his grace, in kindenesse to vs ward in Christ Iesu. THis is an amplification or enlargement, and an An∣tithesis or opposition, whereby the common state of the Iewes and Gentiles vnder grace is declared. Be∣fore, the Apostle spake seuerallie of them both: now he comprehendeth and putteth them both together, that he might shew the equall condition and state of them both. The summe of the sentence is this. As God made the Iewes partakers of heauenlie glorie, euen thorough his méere grace & goodnesse: so did he also the Gentiles. But the Apostle, to the ende he might enlarge his speach, am∣plifieth the same according to his manner, by the place of causes and effects: rehearsing the selfe same things here, which he spake in the first Chapter touching this myste∣rie. For in the first place he setteth downe the principall ground, or chiefe cause of our restitution and recouerie: to wit, the méere mercie of God, wherewith he loued vs in
Christ. After that, he maketh mention of the fruites of this mercie, which is of thrée sorts: namelie, of life, of re∣surrection, and of heauenlie grace in Christ. For the life of Christ, his resurrection, and his sitting in heauenlie places, is a certeine assurance, a pledge, and merit of our life, our resurrection, and heauenlie grace. For seeing we are the members of Christ, we shall be partakers of the same happinesse and glorie with our head. And as the A∣postle maketh Christ the meane, by whom these so great benefits are conueied vnto vs: so he maketh the decla∣ring of Gods grace towards men, the end of these bene∣fits, giuen and bestowed vpon vs. Neither is this a de∣claring of Gods temporall goodnesse, but an vnspeakable token and signe of his perpetuall goodnesse. For, that which Christ once did, that remaineth for euer, as an as∣sured warrant of Gods goodnesse towards vs. Now, tou∣ching that which is inclosed in a Parenthesis, (By grace ye are saued,) it is indéed a verie short saieng, howbeit the same conteineth the whole summe and cause of all Gods good graces, powred vpon vs through Christ: the benefit it selfe, is (Saluation:) the cause is (Grace:) that is, the honour of God, which is grounded in Christ, and from him conueied vnto vs, as from the head to the members. Héere againe is commended vnto vs a generall doctrine of the Church of God: to wit, that vnto God alone, for Christ his sonnes sake, our redemption is to be ascribed. By which doctrine their vanitie is disproued, who referre the benefit of our saluation to mens workes & merits, ei∣ther going before, or following after, or ioined with iusti∣fication. But this doctrine is treated vpon more at large, in the point or discourse following: and it is amplified by it owne proper causes, vnproper causes put apart. Verses. 8. 9. &. 10 8 For by grace are ye saued, through faith, (and that not of your selues: it is the gift of God.)
9 Not of vvorkes, least anie man should boast himselfe. 10 For we are his vvorke∣manship, created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, that vve should vvalke in them. By grace are ye saued through faith (and this is not of your selues, it is the gift of God,) not of workes, least anie man should boast. For we are his workemanship created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God ordein'd (or prepared) be∣fore, that we should walke in them. HEere the Apostle gathereth as it were into one Apho∣risme, the whole matter which hetherto he hath han∣deled: to the ende it maie the better be séene, and that the circumstances and causes also being placed together, might the easier be borne in remembraunce, and vnder∣stood. First therefore he setteth downe (Grace) whereby God taketh vs againe vnto him, of his meere mercie, for Christs sake, who is the matter of our saluation. The effect of this grace, he maketh to be (Saluation:) that is, our iustification, and our glorification. He addeth the in∣strument whereby the same is receiued, euen (Faith.) For by faith we receiue the promise of saluation which the Gospell doth present and offer vnto vs. But bicause false Apostles, sworne enimies to grace, haue for the most part attributed the benefit of saluation to the works of men: the Apostle disproueth them, taking his reason from the contrarie cause. Saluation saith he, is the gift of God, Ergo, it is not of workes: For these two can agrée in no case: To haue somwhat of frée gift: and, To obteine the same by desart of workes. This is auou∣ched by S. Paule,Rom. 11. 6 saieng: Si ex gratia, &c. If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or else were grace no more grace: but if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or else were worke no more worke. How often soeuer therefore our saluation is said to be either the gift of God, or to be of grace, or to be obteined by faith, or to be ours without works, all manner of merit in man, touching the worke of our saluation, is tript and throwne vnder foote. Now, why saluation is not of works, he sheweth a reason in these words, (Least anie man should boast.) Herto ser∣ueth
that saieng also,Rom. 3. 27 Vbi est gloriatio, &c. Where is then the reioising? It is excluded. By what lawe? Of workes? Naie. But by the law of faith. For that which is obtained by faith, is altogether of frée gift, & therfore it excludeth all reioising or boasting: contrariwise, whatsoeuer wée get by our owne workes and trauell, that is matter to vs of boasting. Furthermore, bicause the fleshlie minded, hearing this benefit of saluation to be ours by frée gift, and without workes or merits, that is to saie, without the desart of workes, snatch at it, and therevpon take full libertie to sinne: the Apostle méeteth them in the mouth, and lai∣eth against them, the verie next or néerest end of saluati∣on, which he did beate vpon in the first Chapter: name∣lie, our sanctification. (For we are his workmanship, cre∣ated in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, that we should walke in them.) The word (For) is oftentimes so taken in an obiection, that it séemeth to carrie a reason or cause of a thing with it. But yet notwithstanding, it doth not render a reason or cause of the former speach, but rather giueth a priuie aunswere to the aduersaries obiection. For when Saint Paule saith, that we haue saluation without workes, one or other maie thus obiect and saie: If we obtaine saluation without workes, then what néed we doe good workes? The Apostle aunswereth that it followeth not. For we are created in Christ vnto (good workes.) And thus the word (For) conteineth a reason to reproue the replie of the aduersaries: whose obiecti∣on the Apostle aunswereth in this place. The obseruati∣on of the vse of this word (For) is profitable, that we may knowe and vnderstand whereto the same serueth. Thus farre touching the meaning of this Aphorisme. Now let vs to the specialities of the same in due order. The first, The frée goodnesse of God is the onelie cause of our saluation. The second, By faith alone we are made partakers of saluation freelie giuen. The third, Mans
workes are neither the causes, nor the merites, nor part of our saluation. The fourth, Good workes are ioined with faith, as a necessarie and vnseparable accident. The fift, All mans reioising or boasting in the worke of sal∣uation is excluded. The sixt, Regeneration or new birth in Christ, is the cause of good works. These sixe special∣ties are in the words of this short péece of doctrine, which containe the principall and chiefe grounds of Christian Religion, & confute manie foule and grosse errours. For, first of all, they are confuted héere, which will haue salua∣tion to stand vpon faith and works together, as vpon the parts thereof. But Saint Paule in this place doth mani∣festlie exclude works, and setteth downe faith, not as a part, or as a cause of saluation, but as an instrument only. Secondlie, they are also confuted by this saieng of S. Paule, who, whiles they graunt with vs, that men are iu∣stified by faith alone, exclude works, not onelie as causes and merits, but also as necessarie consequents: as though good works were not necessarilie required in such as are iustified, and haue obtained saluation by frée gift. Against whom S. Paule in this place doth plainlie reason, requi∣ring (Workes) as a necessarie consequent of saluation, and as a necessarie and vnseparable accident of regene∣ration. Workes therefore (as S. Barnard saith) are not the cause of reigning,Rom. 3. 28 but a waie to reigne: not the cause of our comming to Gods kingdome, but a waie thervnto. Furthermore, by this saieng of S. Paule are ouer∣throwen all preparing workes (as they terme them) to iustification. For if our works were required, as prepa∣ratiues, then would not S. Paule haue spoken thus, Abs∣que operibus, Without works. Let vs therefore beare a∣waie, & hold fast this speach of ye Apostle, wherby we are instructed in our saluation, & armed against the errours, both of the Papists, and the Pharisies: besides that, wée are warned what our dutie is, which haue obtained sal∣uation fréelie through Christ.
Verses. 11. 12. &. 13. 11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gen∣tiles in the flesh, & called vncir∣cumcision of them, which are called circumcision in the flesh made vvith hands, 12. That ye vvere, I saie, at that time vvithout Christ, and vvere aliants from the Cōmonvvealth of Israel, and vvere straungers from the couenants of promise, & had no hope, & vvere vvith∣out God in the vvorld: 13 But novv in Christ Iesus, ye vvhich once vvere farre off, are novv made neere by the bloud of Christ. VVherefore bee yee mindfull, that yee were Gentiles in the flesh, which were called vncir∣cumcision of them that are cal∣led circumcision in the flesh made with hands, bicause at that time yee were without Christ, aliens (or foreners) from the Commonwealth of Is∣rael, and straungers of the testaments of promise, hauing no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Christ Iesu, ye which sometime were farre off, are made nigh in the bloud of Christ. THis is an other part of the comparison: to wit, of the state of the Gentiles before grace, and vnder grace: which part of the comparison, doth not in verie deed, but after a certaine manner onelie differ from the former: which manner standeth vpon circumstances. Nowe the Apostle saith, that the Gentiles did differ from the people of God in two circumstances: first, in the signe: second∣lie, in grace. In the signe, bicause that, as the Gentiles were vncircumcised, in witnesse of their vncleannesse: so the Iewes had the circumcision of promise. In grace, bi∣cause that, as the Gentiles were (Without Christ,) who is the onelie waie of saluation, (Out of the Common∣wealth of Israel,) that is to saie, not of Gods people, (Straungers from the couenants of promise,) that is to saie, without the witnesses and testaments, wherby God bound himselfe to his people, (Without hope, and with∣out God,) that is to saie, men liuing in the world, vtterlie voide of Gods feare & seruice: so the Iewes had all these things of grace. For they had the promise of the Messias, they were in the Commonweath of Israel, they were heires of the couenants of promise, they had the hope of saluation, and they knewe God.
To this he addeth an Antithesis or opposition, tea∣ching that the Gentiles are now reconciled vnto God, by the bloud of Christ, & receiued into the Commonwealth and houshold of God, through the same Iesus Christ: Yee (saith the Apostle) which once were farre off▪ (namelie from grace) are now made neere, to wit, by the meanes of Christs bloud. All these things serue to this ende, that he might beate downe the pride & igh min∣dednesse of the Ephesians: and that he might awake them, to wonder at this so great a treasure: least béeing vn∣thankefull to God, they should fall againe into their olde superstition: that is to saie, least forgetting Christs be∣nefits, they should slide backe from the Gospell, being de∣ceiued with the wilie slights of Sathan and the world. This is the summe of all. Nowe, to touch the circum∣stances of the text particularlie, which néedeth both ex∣pounding, and aduise, we will thus procéede. First, hée willeth the Ephesians to (Remember.) And whie so? Be∣cause, when men are aduaunced from a lowe degrée to a higher, they quicklie & easilie (God wot) forget their for∣mer state. By this aduise therefore, or warning, it is the Apostles minde to humble the Ephesians, & to admonish them of constancie, of continuance, & of thankesgiuing: that they might discharge themselues by their duetiful∣nesse, and giue God the glorie, to whom it doth of right be∣long, for powring vpon them so manie great benefits, and that of his frée goodnesse and liberalitie. Héerehence haue we also, which liue at this daie, to be warned and well aduised, that because God hath vouch∣safed, of his méere goodnesse, to call vs out of the darke∣nesse of Poperie, into the cléere light of the Gospell, that we liue worthie of so greate grace, and by the hainous∣nesse of our sinnes prouoke not Gods wrath against vs, least he iustlie and deseruedlie take that from vs a∣gaine, béeing vnthankfull, which before he gaue vs of his good grace, when we were, vnworthie. That is a verie
euill vnthankfulnesse, when men vouchsafe not to giue men thanks for their good turnes: but farre worse, & more abhominable is that, whereby we shew our selues vn∣thankfull vnto God, who would that his déere son should die for vs, that we might liue. Besides this, when the A∣postle saith thus, (Gentiles in the flesh, and called vncir∣cumcision of them which are called circumcision in the flesh, made with hands,) he noteth two things: First, that the Iewes called the Gentiles, by the reprochfull name of vncircumcision: which Iewes indéed bragged much more than they néeded, of that outward marke in their skinne or flesh. Of this bragging and bosting, there is an example in Genesis:Gen. 34. 14. Non possumus, &c. We can∣not (saie the sonnes of Iacob) doe this thing, to giue our sister to an vncircumcised man.1. Sam. 16. 26, &. 36 Againe, Dauid being full of Gods spirit, speaketh of Goliath in this manner, Et quid, &c. Who is this vncircumcised Philistine, that hee should reuile the hoast of the liuing God? This vncir∣cumcised Philistine shall bee as one of thm, seeing he hath railed on the hoast of the liuing God. Againe, S. Paule in this place maketh two sorts of Iewes, and two sorts of Gentiles. For some of the Iewes were circum∣cised in the flesh, and in the spirit: as Moses, Aaron, Io∣sue, Phinees, Abraham, Isaach, Iacob, Ioseph, Dauid, Io∣sias, Daniel, Simeon, Nathanael, &c. to be short, all that receiued the outward circumcision of the flesh, with faith∣fulnes of heart in the Messias promised. Some were cir∣cumcised in the flesh onlie: to wit, they which had the out∣ward marke without the spirit, such were manie: yea, the most of ye Iewes, speciallie at the time of ye Lords cōming: the first are called (The children of promise:) the last, (The children of the flesh:) which names the Apostle giueth to them both. In like manner Paule maketh two sorts of Gentiles. Some were Gentiles onelie in ye flesh, hauing vncircumcision, the badge of their Gentilisme: howbeit in spirit they were circumcised: namelie, which
had the vncircumcision of the flesh, with a liuelie faith∣fulnesse in and vpon the frée promise of saluation. In the number of these were Iob, Melchisedech, Iethro, the thrée Wisemen, & all, as manie as trulie beléeued in the Messi∣as. Othersome were Gentiles, both in the flesh & in the spirit: namelie they, who by the outward badge in their flesh, declared ye vncircumcision & vncleanes of their hart. Furthermore, where he addeth, (Yee were without Christ, ye were aliants from the Commonwealth of Isra∣el, and ye were strangers from the couenants of promise) these words are ment, & must be vnderstood by compari∣son. For the Gentiles, in respect of the people of Israel, & ye certein time, are said to be without Christ. Now, in sai∣eng (They were without Christ,) he meaneth that they had not such cléere knowledge of Christ as the Iews had. (And aliants from the Commonwealth of Israel,) that is to saie, (Straungers from the couenants of promise:) by these words he noteth, that the Israelites had their Com∣monwealth diuided & parted from the Gentiles, as one houshold is set asunder from an other. For the Iewes had their couenants, their ordinances, and seruice of God: their promises, their kingdome, and their Priesthood, &c. of which S. Paule speaketh to the Romans. Of this dif∣ference in like maner,Rom. 9. 4. the Psalme maketh mention, sai∣eng:Psal. 147. 19. 20. Qui annunciat, &c. He sheweth his word vnto Ia∣cob, his statutes and his iudgements vnto Israel. Hee hath not dealt so with euerie nation, neither haue they knowne his iudgementes. The words which folowe, (And had no hope, & were without God in the world,) are concluded vpon ye words which went before. For whosoeuer is without Christ, how is it possible he should haue hope. Whosoeuer is without Christ, he indéed is without God: for all that a∣bide not in ye doctrine of Christ, haue not God. Contrari∣wise,2. Iohn. 9. he alone is said to haue God, he (I saie) yt is in Christ by faith. Herto serueth the saieng of S. Iohn, Omnis qui,
&c. Whosoeuer trangresseth, & abideth not in the doc∣trine of Christ, hath not God. Hee that continueth in the doctrine of Christ, hee hath both the Father and the Sonne. The comparison which followeth, (Yee which once were farre off, are made neere by the bloud of Christ,) doth signifie the Ephesians, which were before out of the Church, but now, through grace, receiued and brought in∣to the Church▪ and reconciled vnto God by the bloud of Iesus Christ. All these things tend herevnto, as I haue said alreadie, that we remembring so great a benefit of heauenlie grace, should walke in the feare of God: being mindfull, that this our state requireth new maners, and a new life: to wit,Tit. 2. 12. 13. 14. That we should liue holilie, and ho∣nestlie, godlie, and vnblameablie in this world, looking for that blessed hope, and comming of the glorie of the great God, and our Sauiour Iesus Christ, who gaue him∣selfe for vs, to redeeme vs from iniquitie, & to cleanse vs a peculiar people vnto himselfe, and followers of good workes. Verses. 14. 15. &. 16. 14 For he is our peace, which hath made of both, one: & hath broken the stop of the partition vvall, 15 In abrogating, through his flesh, the hatred, that is, the lavv of commandemēts, vvhich stan∣deth in ordinances, for to make of tvvaine, one nevve man in himselfe, so making peace, 16 And that he might reconcile both vnto God, in one bodie, by his crosse, & staie hatred therby. For hee is our peace, which hath made both one, breaking downe the wall that was a stoppe betweene vs, and put∣ting awaie through his flesh the lawe of commaundements, con∣tained in the lawe written, that of twaine hee might make one newe man in himselfe, so ma∣king peace, and might recon∣cile both in one bodie, by his crosse, staieng hatred there∣by. IT is said, that the Gentiles, which were some∣times out of Gods housholde, are nowe taken in, and made of the number, by Christs bloud. Nowe, there is added a notable figure of Rhetorike, cal∣led
Expolitio, wherby that is expounded more at large, which was said before brieflie & in sum. For the maner of reconciliation or attonement betweene both people: to wit, Iewes and Gentiles, is declared. And to begin with∣all, Christ is made the foundation of this reconciliation or attonement, when it is said thus of the Apostle, (Hee is our peace,) that is to saie, He is the Author of the recon∣ciliation or attonement, whereby of two people: namelie, Iewes & Gentils, there is made one: that is, one Church, which is the peculiar houshold of God. After this is shew∣ed the manner of reconciliation, first in a similitude: then in plaine and euident words. The similitude is this, (The stop of the partition wall) that is to saie, the hedge put betwéene them is cut downe and laid wast. The similitude must be expounded in this sort. As he that is minded of two housholds to make but one, pulleth downe the wall which was betwéene them, and made them two sundrie housholds, whereby they are now made but one: so God, minding to make one peo∣ple, one Church, or one houshold of the Iewes & the Gen∣tiles, tooke awaie (The partition wall) which set them a∣sunder. Now what this (Partition wall) betwéene ye Iews and the Gentiles was, he sheweth in these plaine words, (The hatred, that is, the lawe of commandements which standeth in ordinances.) Here, by the figure Metonymia, he calleth (Hatred) the cause of the separation betwéene the Iewes and the Gentiles, which cause he maketh to be (The law of commandements which standeth in ordi∣naunces.) Now, when he maketh this cause to be the lawe, he meaneth not the morall lawe, which is perpetu∣all: but the ceremoniall lawe onelie, which was a sha∣dowe of things to come. And this is that which the A∣postle saith, (He hath taken awaye hatred, euen the lawe of commandements, which standeth in ordinaun∣ces,) that is, in rites and ceremonies: (Through his flesh,) that is, by offering vp his flesh a sacrifice. A signe
or token of this abrogation or taking awaie of the lawe, was the renting of the temple in sunder,Mat. 27. 5. when the Lord gaue vp the ghost vpon the altar of the crosse. He addeth also the end of this abrogation or abolishment,Mark. 15. 38. saieng: (To make of twaine,Luke. 23. 45. one new man in himselfe.) By the figure Metonymia, he caleth two nations of people, as it were di∣uerse housholds, by the name of (two men.) He calleth the Church of God one man, which is as it were one hous∣hold: yea rather, one man, whose head is Christ: he calleth this man, (the new man:) hauing an eie to the fashion & custome of the world, which vseth to call them (new men) that being but base borne, or comming but of meane stocke and parentage, become noble and honourable. For we being the ofspring of Adam, our forlorne father, are made (new men,) and adopted into the sonnes of God, whiles we fasten our faith vpon Christ: so that we are no longer called the children of Adam, but the children of God. He rehearseth this ende yet more plainlie, sai∣eng, (That he might reconcile both vnto God in one bo∣die, by his crosse,) that is: by the oblation which he made vpon the crosse. For vnder this word (Crosse) is meant the manner of making the oblation, whereby a double reconciliation or attonement was made: the one, of men with God: the other, of men with men: name∣lie, of the Iewes and Gentiles betwéene themselues. Thus farre concerning the meaning of Saint Paules words, now let vs marke the specialties, which this place doth offer and affoord. The first is, that betwéene the Iewes and the Gen∣tils there is no difference, in respect of the communion and partaking of grace. Wherefore let none be proud, because he is a Iew: and let none despaire, because he is a Gentile. For one nation hath no more prerogatiue or excellence than another,Actes. 10. 34. 35. before God. God is no regarder of persons: but in all people, he that feareth him is ac∣cepted before him: and he that worketh righteousnesse
is esteemed. Grace is common vnto all, and it is offe∣red to euerie one. The second is, That the lawe of Moses is abrogated and put downe, (I meane for outward rites and ceremo∣nies:) insomuch, that none stands compellable to receiue it: yea, whosoeuer receiueth it, denieth Christ, and de∣spiseth the vertue of Christs crosse. The third is, That the death of Christ is the recon∣ciliation & attonement of man with God: wherin we are borne (new men) & ingraffed into Christs bodie, as mem∣bers of the same. The fourth is, That without the crosse of Christ, we can, by no meanes, be at peace with God. The fift is, That as in Christ we haue peace with God: so it is méete, that in him also we labour to be at peace and vnitie one with another: which (doubtlesse) can neuer be, vnlesse we be lead by Christs spirit, and haue faith in him. For by faith we are ingraffed into his bo∣die, that all of vs, as manie as beléeue in Christ, maie be made the members of Christ. Wherfore it is reason and dutie, that one of vs should make much of another, as members of one and the selfe same bodie. Verses. 17. & 18. 17 And came and preached peace vnto you, vvhich vvere a farre off, & to them that were neere. 18 For through him, vve both haue an entrance vnto the Fa∣ther by one spirit. And comming, he preached peace vnto you, which were far off, & to them that were nigh. Because through him we both haue an open waie in one spirit vnto the Father. THe matter of reconciliation or attonement betwéene the Iewes and the Gentiles being expounded, the A∣postle commeth to the instrumentall cause thereof, which is, The preaching of the Gospell. For it is Gods pleasure, that his Gospell should not onelie be an instrument of saluation, but also a witnesse and warrant of his good will. Wherevpon it commeth to passe, that the Gospell is vnto vs, a most assured and certeine messenger, and ti∣dings bringer of peace, betwéene God and vs. For which
cause the Gospell is named,2. Co. 5. 19 Sermo reconciliationis, The word of reconciliation. The diuision following, where Christ is said to haue come, and to haue preached to them (which were a farre off, and to them which were neere:) that is to saie, to the Iewes, and to the Gentiles, noteth vnto vs, that Christ sent his Apostles to preach the Gos∣pell of peace vnto all people, one with an other, none ex∣cepted:Mark. 16. 15. according to that saieng: Ite in mundum, &c. Goe ye throughout all the world, and preach the Gos∣pell vnto euerie creature. The fruite of their peace made with God is also added, which is, that both of them: to wit, the Iewes and the Gentiles, (Haue entraunce vnto the Father, by Christ, and that in one spirit:) that is to saie, by the selfe same spirit of Christ, which maketh vs crie,Rom. 8. 15 Abba Father. Christ therefore is as it were a doore vnto vs,Gal. 4. 6. whereby we come to the Father, being reconci∣led and set at one with vs, in faith and beliefe. Now the holie spirit is our guide, by whom we being ioined and v∣nited in Christ, comming to the doore, are let in, and haue entrance to the father. Hereto serueth that saieng of Iohn, Amen,Ioh. 10. 1. &. 7. Amen dico vobis, &c. Verelie Verelie I saie vnto you, he that entreth not in by the doore into the sheep∣fold, but climeth vp another waie, he is a theefe, and a robber. And a little after, Ego sum ianua ouium, I am the doore of the sheepe. Furthermore, here are two places to be marked: the one is, what accompt we ought to make of the ministers of the Gospell, who when they preach to vs the gospell, Christ himselfe is said to preach vnto vs. Wherfore we ought no lesse to regard their voice, than if we heard Christ himselfe speaking vnto vs. Herto serueth that saieng of Saint Paule,2. Co. 19. 20. Nomine, &c. Now then are we ambassadors for Christ, as though he did beseech you through vs, we praie you in Christs stead, that ye be re∣conciled to God. The other place is, of the fruit of ye gos∣pell: namelie, that such as beléeue ye gospel, are reconciled vnto God through Christ, by whom they haue entraunce
vnto God. The Apostle saith, Iustificati, &c. Being iusti∣fied by faith,Rom. 5. 1. 2 we haue peace towards God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom also we haue entraunce, &c. Contrariwise, who so hath not Christ, that is, beléeueth not in Christ, he is void of the fruite of the Gospell: and therefore is to be thought and taken for a wicked person, and an enimie to God. Verse. 19. &. 20. 19 Novv therefore, ye are no more straungers and forreig∣ners, but Citizens vvith the Saints, and of the houshold of God, 20 And are built vpon the foundation of the Apostles & Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone. Now therefore, ye are no more straungers and forreigners, but fellowe citizens of the Saints, and of Gods houshold, being builded vpon the foundation of the Apo∣stles and Prophets, the chiefe cor∣ner stone whereof is Iesus Christ himselfe. THis is a generall conclusion of the whole Chapter, wherin he reckoneth vp the principall points. For, first he sheweth what manner of people the Ephesians were, before the grace of regeneration or new birth, & by them all other Gentiles, likewise. Secondlie, he declareth what they haue gotten by grace. Indéede they were ali∣ants & strangers before, that is, out of Gods houshold, as we haue shewed alredie. But now being made frée of the Citie, common to all the Saints, they are receiued into Gods houshold: because (They are built vpon the foun∣dation of the Apostles and Prophets,) that is to saie, be∣cause they are receiued into fauour and grace by faith, which is their leaning staffe, to rest themselues by, vpon Christ their onelie foundation. For no man can laie anie other foundation,1. Co. 3. 11 besides that which is alreadie laid, which is Iesus Christ. Now, Iesus Christ is called (The foundation,) both because the promise of saluation was made in him, and
also, because Christ alone is the saluation of the Church, vpon whom she staieth her selfe. For, without Christ, the whole building of the Church shrinketh and falleth flat to the ground: yea, without him, it cannot be so much as once begun. He is also called (The foundation of the A∣postles and Prophets,) not onelie because the Apostles being built vpon that foundation obteined saluation: but also, and that much more in respect of the Church. For, the Apostles did build the Church vpon this foundation. Moreouer, when the Apostle addeth, (Iesus Christ him∣selfe being the chiefe corner stone,) he teacheth vs, by what power & vertue, the building of the Church, consist∣ing of two diuerse people, Iewes & Gentiles, continueth: namelie, because (Iesus Christ himselfe is the chiefe cor∣ner stone.) For, as the corner stone ioineth walles toge∣ther, and beareth vp the whole burthen of the building: yea, preserueth it: euen so our Lord Iesus Christ, by the doctrine of faith, and by the efficacie and forceable work∣ing of his spirit, knitteth the Iewes and the Gentiles, in vnitie of faith and peace: and so he himselfe vpholdeth and mainteineth this spirituall building. This similitude is borowed of the Prophet Esaie, whose words lie thus in order, Ecce, ego ponam in Syon lapi∣dem,Esaie. 28. 16. &c. Behold; I will late in Syon a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a se foundation: He that be∣leeueth, shall not make hast: namelie, to his owne coun∣selles, but shall attend and wait for the counsell and pur∣pose of God, which if he doe, he shall not be put to shame. The selfe same saieng of the Prophet, Saint Peter reher∣seth, the sense reserued, but the words a little chaunged. For thus saith he: Ecce, ponam, &c. Behold, I will put in Syon a chiefe corner stone,1. Pet. 2. 6. elect and precious, and he that beleeueth therein, shall not be ashamed. Of this stone, mention is also made in the Psalme: Lapidem quem,Psal. 11. 8 22. &c. The stone which the builders refused, is the head of the corner.
Beside that which is said, we haue to gather out of Saint Paules words, these specialties following. The first is, That of Iewes and Gentiles there is one Church of Christ made and ioined together, as we haue shewed alreadie. The second is, That Christ alone is the foundation of the Church. The third is, That whosoeuer is without Christ, he also is without the Church. The fourth is, That the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets alone, ought to haue authoritie in the Church of God, and is the onelie badge and cognisance of the true Church. The fift is, That Christ alone vpholdeth, kéepeth, and mainteineth the Church. The sixt is, That the Church is not without ministe∣rie, which preacheth vnto vs the same corner stone which Saint Paule commendeth vnto vs heere. These specialties ouerthrowe manie errours of the Papists: and chiefelie of them, which will haue vs trust and betake our selues to mens merits and safegards: and which also, in the place of the Prophets and Apostles doctrine, plant mens traditions and forgeries. Let Pope∣rie therefore be vnto all the godlie, a thing most accur∣sed: which it behoueth all true Christians to auoid and flie from, least they themselues be ill fauouredlie defiled therewith, and being defiled, be also cast off againe, and forsaken of God. Verses. 21. &. 22. 21 In vvhom all the building coupled together, grovveth vnto an holie Temple in the Lord, 22 In vvhom ye also are built together, to be the habitation of God, by the spirit. In whom the whole building (or frame) coupled together accordinglie, groweth vnto an holie Temple in the Lord, in whom also ye are built together to be Gods dwelling in the spi∣rit. THe Apostle enlargeth his conclusion, by a translation, or turning of the specialties into a generalitie, & by an
exhortation. He said that the Ephesians were built vpon the foundation of the Apostles & Prophets: now he appli∣eth this to all the faithfull in generall. For, he saith, that (The whole building,) that is, the whole Catholike Church, and all the members thereof, being builded vpon this one corner stone, (Groweth into an holie temple:) that is to saie, that the whole building is made one holie temple, & that in the Lord, as the onelie foundation of the temple. Now, S. Paule in this place vseth a verie full, significant, and pithie word: namelie, : that is (coupled together) wherby is ment, that ye building of the Church is so knit and couched together, so framed, I saie, and wrought, that all and euerie part thereof is fitted and fastened, in such méete proportion, euen mea∣sure, and apt agréement, with such sound & strong ioints, that they hang one by an other verie orderly, as the mem∣bers and lims of the bodie. Now, this knitting or con∣pling of the ioints is done in this manner. First, all the faithfull cleaue vnto Christ their head by faith, and vpon him, as their onelie foundation, state themselues. Then they cleaue together among themselues, one wt another, according to the measure of faith in euerie one of them, and according to the diuersitie of gifts, which God hath giuen them: that they might all make one bodie, & one holie temple of God, of which temple, all the faithfull are liuelie stones, in such excéeding comelie order and agrée∣ment knit together, & wrought in one, that there is not a corporation or companie of men to be found in all the world, linked in like loue, concord, and vnitie among themselues. Furthermore, when we heare either the whole Church, or the seuerall members thereof, cal∣led (The holie temple of God,) let vs thus suppose with our selues: First, That the Church is Gods building. Secondlie, That God dwelleth, in this temple, which is appointed and ordeined for his glorie. Thirdlie, That as it is a fowle and hainous offense▪ to defile this
temple with anie vncleannesse, so it becommeth all the gooue, to bend their endeuours euerie waie, that they maie lead their life in holinesse & vnblameablenesse, least through their default it come to passe, that the Maister builder cast them out, and throwe them awaie, as rotten and mooldering stones seruing to no good vse. I would to God this could sinke into their hearts, which either with their owne priuate lewd dealings blemish the Church: or with their vnprofitable quarelings, cut in péeces the v∣nion or agréement of the Church. Heere the reason must be marked, why the whole Church of God is called (One temple:) and why euerie seuerall beleeuer, is named (The liuelie temple of God) in like case. The whole Church is therefore called the temple of God, both because it is reared vp and built vpon one foundation: and also because all the faith∣full being ioined together in the vnitie of faith and loue, haue God dwelling in them, whom they serue and wor∣ship. Euerie seuerall Christian is therefore called the liuelie temple of God, both for that euerie of them is buil∣ded vpon one onelie foundation, which is the Lord Iesus Christ: and also, for that God dwelleth in euerie of them, whose mightinesse is to be praised and magnified of all generallie, and also of euerie one particularlie. The exhortation of the Apostle doth folowe. (In whom (saith he) ye also are built together to be the habitation of God, by the spirit.) (In whom.) to wit, the corner stone, (ye also are built together:) namelie, by the faith of Christ, and loue among your selues one with another, renouncing and forsaking all vnholinesse, heathenishnesse, and vncleannesse. After this manner the Apostle speak∣eth elsewhere, in an exhortation, drawing his argument or proofe from the dignitie or worthinesse of Gods tem∣ple.1. Co. 6. 9 For these are his words, Ah: Non scitis, &c. Ah: Know ye not, that your bodie is the temple of the holie Ghost, which is in you, whom ye haue of God?
¶THE THIRD CHAPTER. ¶THE SVMME OF THE third Chapter. I Paule a Prisoner of Iesus Christ, beare am∣bassage for your behoofe, O ye Gentiles, to open and make knowne vnto you the mysterie of saluation. Wherefore I request you to continue constant and sted∣fast in the doctrine which ye haue receiued: whereto, that the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, would vouchsafe to giue you strength, I bow my knees, to whom be glorie for euermore. THE ORDER AND PARTES OF the third Chapter. OF this Chapter there are foure partes. The first is, a comfirmation of the calling of the Gentiles, wher∣of he reasoned in the last Chapter: which confirmation is taken from Saint Paules Apostleship, or from the end whereto it was ordeined: the summe of it is this. God hath made and appointed me Paule an Apostle of the Gentiles: therefore belongeth the Gospell to the Gen∣tiles in déede. This part hath his amplifications or en∣largements, whereby both the Gospell is aduanced, and Saint Paules Apostleship also commended. The seconde part standeth vpon an exhortation to constancie and perseueraunce, which is the ende of his whole writing: as I gaue you to note euen nowe, in the declaration of the Argument or summe of the E∣pistle. The third part is a signification of Saint Paules prai∣er for the Ephesians, that it would please God to giue them strength and perfect knowledge of Christ. The fourth is a thankesgiuing. The first of these
partes is didascalicall, that is, seruing for doctrine, from the which the rest haue their issue, wherein the doctrine is applied to the Ephesians. ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE THIRD Chapter, with the obseruation of doctrines therein contained. Verse. 1. 1 For this cause, I Paule am the prisoner of Iesus Christ, for you Gentiles. For this things sake, I Paule am that same prisoner (or captiue) of Iesus Christ for you Gentiles. THis is the first part of the Chapter: to wit, a confirmation of the calling of the Gentiles. The meaning of the wordes is this. Mine Apostleshippe which I beare among the Gentiles, and for the which I am now kept prisoner, is a proofe suffi∣cient, that the Gospell pertaineth to the Gentiles. (The prisoner or captiue of Christ,) is passiuelie taken, and betokeneth to suffer. For Saint Paule was taken and kept prisoner for the glorie of Christ, shewed vnto the Gentiles. I haue added the particle (Sum, Am,) as Erasmus doth, to make the sentence fall perfect and ful, that (Prisoner) might be the Predicatum, which ther∣fore hath verie well his Article ioined with him, bicause it is taken figuratiuelie,  for excellencie sake, as in that of S. Iohn, , I am not that same light. And againe, , I am that good shepheard. So héere also, , I am that same prisoner of Iesus Christ, who haue the name euerie where to bee him, that would make the Gentiles equall with the Iewes: for which things sake, I am now lead awaie to Rome, and there kept pri∣soner. Héere thrée places offer themselues vnto vs. The first, That the preaching of the Gospell is ordeined for the
building vp of the Church. The seconde, That the god∣lie preachers of the word, must looke for nothing but trouble and persecution at the hands of the world. The third, That the preaching of the Gospell is a most assu∣red token and vndoubted warrant of Gods fauour. Verses. 2. 3. &. 4. 2 If ye haue heard of the dis∣pensation of the grace of God, vvhich is giuen mee to you vvard, 3 That is, that God by reuela∣tion hath shevved this mysterie vnto me, as I vvrote aboue in fevv vvords: 4 Whereby, vvhen ye read, ye maie knovve mine vnderstan∣ding in the mysterie of Christ. If ye haue heard of the dis∣pensation, (or ministration) of the grace of God, which is gi∣uen me to you ward, to wit, that God by reuelation hath made the Gospell knowne vn∣to me, (as I wrote vnto you be∣fore, whereby, when yee read ye may vnderstand my know∣ledge in the mysterie of Christ. THis is a cause of the former reason, taken from the cause efficient, which (he saith) was not vnknowne to the Ephesians. First he sheweth, he was called of God to the office of an Apostle. Secondlie, he declareth ye man∣ner of his calling. Thirdlie, he auoucheth that he learned the Gospell from aboue, euen of God, concerning which thing he wrote to the Ephesians before, as he saith, to the intent that they in reading, might vnderstand & knowe the certeintie of his doctrine and calling.Acts. 9. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. &c. All these points pertaine to this purpose, that we may be assured, that S. Paule was an Apostle of the Gentiles, by the appoint∣ment and commaundement of God,Acts. 22. 4 5. 6. 7. &c. so that wée neede not at anie hand to doubt of the certeintie of his vocation or calling:Acts. 26. 12 13. 14. 15. &c. testimonies whereof may bée read in the Actes of the Apostles, in his Epistles to the Galathians, and the Philippians.Gal. 1. 13. 14. 15. &c. Héere thrée things méet vs worthie of marking.Phil. 3. 4. 5 &c. First, How necessarie the certeintie of their calling is, which
teach in the Church. The second, That the Gospell is a mysterie vnknowne to mans reason: flat against that most filthie and beastlie knaue, which braggeth without shame, that he (forsooth) by naturall reason found out the necessitie of the Gospell, and the sending of the Messi∣as into the world, without the writings of the Prophets and Apostles. The third, That the certeintie of the A∣postles doctrine is vnmoueable, stedfast, and vndecei∣uable. Verses. 5. & 6. 5 Which in other ages vvas not opened vnto the sonnes of men, as it is novv reuealed vn∣to his Apostles and Prophets, by the spirit, 6 That the Gentiles should be inheritours also, & of the same bodie, and partakers of his pro∣mise in Christ, by the Gospell. VVhich in other ages (or times) was not knowne to the sonnes of men, as it is now o∣pened vnto the holie Apostles and Prophets, by the spirit, that the Gentiles are coheires and of the same bodie, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospell. THis is an amplification or enlargment by compari∣son, wherein a reason is rendered, why the Gospell of the calling of the Gentiles is named (A Mysterie:) to wit, bicause it was vnknown to the world, till such time as it was opened by heauenlie reuelation: that it was not made manifest to all the Gentiles indifferentlie, one with an other: that the knowledge of this mysterie was not so euident to the olde Prophets, as it was to the A∣postles. For, although the olde Prophets prophesied much of the calling of the Gentiles to the Gospell: yet notwithstanding, the time and the manner thereof were not so cléere to them, as to the Apostles, Nowe, what kinde of mysterie this is of the Gospell, which hee hath in hand, he declareth, in saieng, (That the Gentiles should be inheritours also, and of the same bodie, and partakers of his promise, in Christ, by the Gospell.) The
mysterie of the Gospell therfore is this, That the Iewes and the Gentiles are made ioint-heires of the heauenlie inheritaunce, that they all make one bodie in Christ, and that the promise of grace, which is offered by the Gos∣pell, pertaineth vnto them both alike. This equalitie, or making of the Iewes and Gentils all alike, ouerthrow∣eth the prerogatiue or title of excellencie, whereof the Iewes maie séeme to vaunt. For, saluation is a méere frée gift, which is also offered fréelie to the most vnwor∣thie Gentiles, and to Idolaters, but is receiued by faith alone. For when the Apostle saith, (Of his promise in Christ,) and when he maketh the Iewes and the Gen∣tiles euen and equall: what else doth he, but exclude and harre out all degrées of worthinesse in merites, and re∣quireth the faith of the promise? The specialties of this place followe in order. The first, That the Gospell is a mysterie, which mans reason cannot of it selfe, by anie meanes, reach vnto. The second, That the mysterie of the Gospell is re∣ueled by the holie Ghost, in preaching with liuelie voice, and sounding vtterance. For outward preaching auai∣leth and profiteth little, vnlesse there be present with∣in vs, the true teacher: namelie, the holie Ghost, which is effectuall and forceable in the worde, and with the word. The third, That all Christs faithfull ones, are heires of one and the selfe same inheritaunce, members of one and the selfe same bodie, and partakers of one and the selfe same saluation, by one and the selfe same Iesus Christ. The fourth, That the dignitie of the ministrie of the Gospell is excéeding great, and the necessitie thereof is not smal. For, by the same, the promise of saluation, which is to be receiued by faith alone, is offered vnto all in Christ Iesus.
Verse. 7. 7 Whereof I am made a minister, by the gift of the grace of God, giuen vnto me, through the vvorking of his povver. VVhereof I am made a mi∣nister, according to the gift of Gods grace, giuen vnto me, ac∣cording to the working of his power. SAint Paule méeteth them in the téeth, which would charge him with arrogancie, for that he doth so high∣lie aduance his ministerie, & he vseth a certaine shifting off from himselfe to an other. For, he doth not make his owne merit or vertue, but Gods grace, the cause that hée was called to be an Apostle. Againe, he ascribeth it to the working of Gods power, that by his Apostleship, it plea∣sed God to build his Church. For séeing God is able to bring to passe, that things which are not, maie bée: why then might he not of a bloudsucker make a Apostle? why then might he not of an arrogant person, make a wise preacher? why then might he not of a weakling, make a Champion? Let euerie one of vs set before his eies this example of S. Paule, & if we couet & desire to séeme anie thing in ye house of God, let vs confesse, that it is the gift of God: if anie of vs haue some place of dignitie & account in the Church, let him acknowlege that it was the wor∣king of Gods power: if anie thing that is singular & ex∣cellent proceede from him, let him cast awaie all vaine arrogancie & bragging, let him abase himself before God, let him knowe that greater gifts are giuen him, that he might be more bound to serue others, & not to take vpon him the office of a Controller, to reproue & finde fault with others: but let him honour & reuerence euerie one, according as his place and degrée shall require. Athanasius noteth vpon this place,Three things ne¦cessarie in the Mini∣sters of Gods vvord. that in the mini∣sters of Gods word, three things are necessarie. The first, a stoute and valiant heart that will not shrinke in anie daunger: as heere S. Paule writeth and preacheth Christ boldlie, and with a courage, euen in bonds and imprison∣ment. The second, wisdome and vnderstanding, with∣out
which he is not able to discharge this hard & buisie office. The third, an vpright life, holie, and honest. For it is the dutie of a shepheard to goe before his flock, no lesse in life than in voice: and as well in deed, as in word. When these thrée things shine in the ministers of God, their labour cannot be without plentifull fruit. Contrari∣wise, when the hearts of the ministers are striken dead with the feare of Tyrants, when they are discouraged, when the foundations of their doctrine are not faithfullie laid, when their life is not answerable to the worthinesse of their calling, then the church of God is in a miserable taking. For what shall become of the shéep, when either the shepheard is deuoured of the woolfe, or else vnarmed fléeth from the woolfe, leauing his shéep at hap hazard? Verses. 8. 9. 10. &. 11. 8 Euen vnto me the least of all Saints is this grace giuen, that I should preach among the Gen∣tiles, the vnsearchable riches of Christ, 9 And to make cleere vnto all men, vvhat the fellowship of the mysterie is, vvhich from the beginning of the vvorld hath bene hid in God, vvho hath cre∣ated all things by Iesus Christ, 10 To the intent that novv, vnto principalities and powers in heauenlie places, might bee knovvne, by the Church, the manifold vvisedome of God, 11 According to the eternall purpose, vvhich he vvrought in Christ Iesus our Lord. Vnto me the least of all Saints this grace is giuen, euen to preach among the Gentiles, the vnsearchable riches of Christ, and to make euident vnto all men, what the followshippe (or communion) of this mysterie is, which hath bene hidden from beginnings in God, who made all things through Christ, that now might bee knowne vnto rules and powers in heauenlie places, by the Church (or con∣gregation,) the manifold wise∣dome of God, according to the eternall purpose, which hee purposed (or decreed) in our Lord Iesus Christ. THat which the Apostle had brieflie touched, he dis∣courseth vpon more at large: namelie, that he was called of God to be an Apostle of the Gentiles. And this is the sum of this long period or point. But, that we maie gather greater fruite thereout, I will seuerallie intreat vpon euerie part of this amplification or enlargement,
and make the same serue to our vse First therefore when he saith, (Vnto me the least of all Saints, is this grace giuen,) he doth not abase his of∣fice, but acknowledgeth the condition of his own person: and that for this purpose, that the greatnesse of: Gods grace towards him might the more excell. What learne we by this? Euen to magnifie & aduance our office, wher∣vnto we are called, with thanksgiuing, and to take no∣thing vnto our selues arrogantlie. If therefore we do anie thing aright, let vs ascribe the same wholie vnto Gods grace, not to our selues, who without the grace of God are vtterlie vnprofitable instruments. Let the godlie shepheard therefore not suffer his office to bée despised, al∣though he acknowledge himselfe vnable and vnfit for so great a calling. Againe, let him not sette light by other his fellow-labourers, as his vnderlings, and himselfe their better: but let him confesse that they all (as well as hée) are stewardes of the mysteries of God. Secondlie, when the Apostle addeth, (That I should preach among the Gentiles the vnsearchable riches of Christ,) hée sheweth the ende of his Apostleshippe. For he saith, he was made an Apostle. Whie? Not that vn∣der this title hée should boast in idlnesse: but (That hee should preach the vnsearchable riches of Christ,) which (as Saint Ambrose saith) hée vouchsafed to bestowe vpon the Gentiles, a people past hope, that without workes they might bée saued, euen through faith. Nowe, he calleth them (Vnsearchable riches of Christ,) not onelie bicause the searching of them out is beyond the reach of reason: but also bicause they cannot be found out at the full in this world: no, not of the faith∣full: but a tast onelie giuen vnto them, which is inough for the hope of saluation. By this speach therfore of the A∣postle, not onlie their arrogancie is rebuked, which thinke that they haue in their heads, whatsoeuer is conteined in
Gods holie word: but there is also commended vnto vs a singular and speciall diligence, that we should trauell (tooth and naile) all that we maie, to profit continuallie in the schoole of Christ: ralling vpon the holie spirit our teacher, without whose assistaunce and aide, our labour is vtterlie lost, in seeking to obteine this spirituall wise∣dome. Againe, they are also put to silence, & dasht, which vainlie cogge and lie, that they are Saint Paules succes∣sors: albeit they preach not with Saint Paule, (The vn∣searchable riches of Christ,) touching remission of sinnes fréelie giuen: but either liue like idle and lazie lubbers: or else bring a doctrine, which is at defiance and daggers drawing with the Gospell of Christ. Thirdlie, when this is added, (And to make cleare vnto all men, what the fellowship of the mysterie is,) the Apostle expoundeth the clause going before. For that which he called euen now (That vnsearchable riches of Christ,) he expoundeth now a certeine fellowship & par∣taking of the benefits of Christ, which the Gospell offe∣reth: to wit, That the Iewes and the Gentiles are par∣takers of the selfe same redemption in Christ. Herehence let vs therefore learne, that all difference of people, per∣son, estate, and degrée, is taken awaie: for the kingdome of Christ meddeleth with no such matter:Ro. 10. 12 For one and the same Christ is rich inough vnto all that call vpon him. Fourthlie, when it is thus said, (Which from the beginning of the world hath bene hidde in God, who hath created all things by Iesus Christ,) he cutteth off their obiection, which despised the Gospell, as a doctrine but latelie hatcht: as manie also in the Apostles time did. Héereby let vs take heart at grasse against the eni∣mies of the Gospell, which fowlie béelie vs; calling vs brochers and builders of a certeine new and straunge doctrine. For, our cause is common with the holie Apo∣stles of God. Neither are these words added in waste,
(Who hath created all things by Iesus Christ.) For this saieng is a testimonie and witnesse of our new creation. For it is méete and conuenient, that by him we should be newlie created, by whom we were first created. As therefore God, in olde time, created the world by Iesus Christ: so is his good pleasure, by the same Iesus Christ, to restore the world againe, and to create it anew. Out of this place is likewise gathered, not onelie the eterni∣tie and euerlastingnesse of the sonne: (For if God by his sonne created all things, then surelie the sonne himselfe was not created, because he was before euerie creature, and therefore God:) but also a vnitie of two natures: to wit, of the Godhead, and the Manhood: being such a vni∣tie, that the properties of both, by reason of the vnitie of the person, are communicated: and yet the properties vn∣confounded. Therefore Saint Paule saith héere verie well, (That God made and created all things by Iesus Christ:) because this Iesus Christ is verie God. And although it be rightlie said, Iesus the sonne of Marie created all things: yet notwithstanding, it is a∣misse to saie, That the nature of Christs manhood crea∣ted all things. For the nature of Christs manhood is in∣deede a creature, and not a creator. For the interchang∣ing of properties, whereby that which is proper to one, is ascribed and giuen to the other, for the communion of them in the same person, is at no hand to be allowed or graunted in names of nature, or (as the vse is to speake) in the Abstract: because, neither those things which are proper to the Manhood, are to be ascribed to the God∣head: as, To be created, To suffer, To be temporall, To be limitted, &c: neither are those things which be∣long onelie to the Godhead, in anie case to be attributed to the Manhood: as, To be vncreated, Not to suffer, To be eternall, To be vnlimitted, &c: but in the Concrete either naturall, or personall, either expressing one na∣ture, or declaring both, this interchaungeable applieng
of properties maie well be, because of the identitie or selfesamenesse of the Hypostasis or person, and a cer∣teine necessarie sequeale or following: as, that those things which are proper vnto man, should be ascribed vn∣to God,2. Cor. 28. and to the sonne of God, as when it is said, The Lord of glorie was crucified:Mat. 26. 2 to wit, The sonne of man was crucified: now, The Lord of glorie: and, The sonne of man, is all one: therefore the Lord of glorie was al∣so crucified: which is made manifest streightwaie by a Syllogisme expositorie, or by a reason consisting in expo∣sition. So God, in the latter daies became a little childe: of whom the Prophet speaketh in this manner,Esaie. 9. 6. Puer natus est nobis, &c. For vnto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a sonne is giuen: and the gouernment is vpon his shoulder, and he shall call his name, Wonderfull, Counseller, The mightie God, The euerlasting Father, The Prince of peace, &c. Fiftlie, when he saith, (To the intent that now vn∣to principalities, and powers in heauenlie places,) that is, to Gods holie Angels, (might be knowne by the Church, the manifold wisedome of God,) farre aboue all wisedome of creatures, he extolleth the perfect knowledge of Gods mysteries, touching the saluation of the Gen∣tiles by faith, that he might the more deteine and kéepe the Ephesians in admiration and wondering at this my∣sterie. For, why should it not be wonderfull, that contra∣rie things are made of contrarie things? For, by death, life was recouered: by weaknesse, power was obteined: by shame, glorie was gotten: to be short, by death and the cursse, life and saluation was giuen to them that were dead and damned. And héereof it commeth, that the Angels of Heauen are said, , euen to stoope downe,1. Pet. 1. 12. as it were, and attentiuelie to behold and listen, what the Apostles doe preach. Howbeit, this is not so to be taken, as though the Angels profited by the preaching of the Church: but because in the
Church assembled and gathered out of Iewes and Gen∣tiles, they behold, as in a glasse, this wisedome of God, and are asconnished (as it were) at this straunge specta∣cle, that the Lord Christ vouchsafed the wicked & wret∣ched world so great glorie, that all beléeuers should be blessed, and liue with him euerlastinglie. Sixtlie, when it is added (According to the eternall purpose, which he wrought in Christ Iesus our Lord,) he calleth vs backe, both to the first cause of our saluati∣on: to wit, the eternall purpose of God, whereby he de∣créed with himselfe from euerlasting, to saue mankinde: and also to the matter of this saluation: namelie, Iesus Christ. But of these causes we haue spoken largelie inough in the first Chapter. Verse. 12. 12 By vvhom vve haue bold∣nesse and entrance, vvith confi∣dence, by faith in him. By whom we are bold to drawe nigh, in that trust which we haue by faith in him. THe Apostle setteth downe the summe of the benefits of the mysterie reuealed: that is to saie, of the Gos∣pell: and he addeth the manner or meane whereby men receiue those benefits. Now, the sum of the benefits is, that we haue peace with God, by our Lord Iesus Christ. For whosoeuer is not afraid boldlie to come before God, they are persuaded out of doubt, that God is at one with them, and fauourable vnto them: yea, they dare call vp∣on him in all their necessities: to be short, they looke for all good and healthfull things at his hands. The meane whereby we receiue these benefits, is expressed, when he saith, (By faith in him,) that is to saie, by beléeuing in him. This place is to be marked against the Papists,That Christ was born was cru∣cified, vvas buri∣ed, &c. which saie, That faith is onelie a knowledge and an as∣senting to the storie. For Saint Paule expresselie in this
place ioineth confidence with faith, which is the note or marke of a iustifieng faith. Againe, héere are set downe for vs to view, thrée degrées of faith. The first is, to be∣léeue and agrée to the promises of the Gospell. The se∣cond is, confidence of mercie craued in Christ. The third is, boldnesse to goe vnto God, and to call vpon him. To conclude, this place teacheth vs, that calling vpon God cannot be without confidence in Christ. For, as by con∣fidence we haue entrance vnto God: so without confi∣dence, there is no comming to God. Verse. 13. 13 Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations, for your sakes vvhich is your glo∣rie. VVherefore I desire, that you faint not, because of mine afflicti∣ons, for your sakes, which is your praise. THe second part of the Chapter now followeth, which standeth vpon exhortation. For the Apostle exhorteth the Ephesians that they fall not from the Gospell, because he being their Teacher is persecuted & troubled. Now, this proposition is brought in vpon the former matter, in this sort: Because the mysterie is so excellent, which God hath opened vnto you, concerning the obteining of saluation fréelie giuen, by me, whom God hath called to be your Apostle, I would not wish you to plaie the slow∣backes, or to growe out of heart, for the afflictions and crosses sake which I suffer, and am pressed downe withall. To this proposition he addeth two reasons: the first, from the cause efficient: the second, from the end of per∣secution, and the fruite of constancie. (For your sakes,) saith the Apostle, that is to saie: For this cause haue the spitefull Iewes deliuered me vp prisoner into the hands of the Romans, because I haue preached the Gospell vn∣to you, therfore I lie bound in prison, not for anie déede
that I haue committed like an offender: but for faithful∣lie discharging my dutie and office, whereto God hath appointed me. Afterwards, in saieng: (Which is your glorie,) he noteth, that the ende of his persecution is not the shame of the Ephesians, but rather their glorie, sithence they maie see themselues embracers of such a doctrine: as for the truth and excellencie whereof, their teacher is not a∣feard to suffer, euen extreame troubles. Wherefore, it is meete, that they also be constant to mainteine this doc∣trine, and valiant likewise against the sharpe stormes of afflictions. Hetherto we haue declared the Apostles mea∣ning: now let vs gather a fewe specialties to serue our owne vse. The first, The godlie, knowing the worthinesse and excellencie of the Gospell, shall take héede, that they suf∣fer not themselues to be pulled from the same, either with smooth flatterings, and alluring meanes: or with bitter threats, and sharpe persecutions. The second, The godlie shall take héede, that they be not deceiued with the iudgement and custome of the world. For, the world is woont to set light by those things, which men of authoritie make no accompt of. Againe, which waie soeuer Fortune turneth her selfe, that waie will the fauour and estimation of men be sure to bend. For present prosperitie, Oh: that is welcome to all. This errour of the world being verie great, as it is dan∣gerous, so it must be auoided of the godlie. For godli∣nesse must not be iudged by the outward appearaunce, but the nature and qualitie of the thing is rather to be looked into, and a deliueraunce patientlie to be waited vp∣on, according to the vndeceiuable promise of God. The third, Let the ministers of the Gospell learne (by the example of Saint Paule) a godlie and holie careful∣nesse for their flocke, that it maie be kept and continued in sinceritie of doctrine. For, it is not inough to haue
taught aright, vnlesse thou also take héede, with all thine endeuour, that the purenesse of doctrine be not, by anie kinde of occasion, poisoned or infected. The fourth, The constancie of the ministers of the word, in bearing the crosse, maketh the Gospell more ho∣nourable: & it is confirmed with the bloud of the Saints, as it were with a certeine seale or signet. The fift, A consolation against the offense of the crosse: wherein this is to be learned, and borne awaie, that the crosse of the godlie is not shamefull before God, but ra∣ther glorious: and then chiefelie, when anie one suffe∣reth for the confession of true doctrine. As Saint Peter also teacheth, who saith, that to suffer for Christs sake, is the great glorie of Christians. For the counsell and purpose of God in this point is to be considered,1. Pet. 13. 14. 15. &c, whose pleasure it is, to make them like to his sonne in this world, whom he determined with himselfe long since to glorifie with him. The sixt, Héerehence let the ministers of the Gospell peculiarlie learne, not onelie when they are well, and all things safe, stoutlie to doe their dutie, and to followe their office manfullie: but also to shewe themselues vali∣ant hearted, & noble Champions: yea euen then, when the burthen of the Crosse doth bow them, euen till they bend vnder it. A small matter for vs (saith he) which are in health, to giue good counsell to the sicke: A small matter constantlie to teach the Gospell, when all things are in safetie, when there is no shewe of danger toward. But this is the propertie of a right noble heart, in the middest of afflictions, in the middest of the flaming fire, (as Saint Paule and other Saints haue done,) couragi∣ouslie to comfort such as neuer yet tasted the Crosse, a∣gainst sharpe showres and tempests of tribulations to come.
Verses. 14, 15. 16. 17. 18. &. 19. 14 For this cause I bovv my knees vnto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. 15 (Of whom is named the vvhole familie in heauen & in earth) 16 That he might graunt you, according to the riches of his glorie, that ye maie be streng∣thened by his spirit, in the in∣ner man, 17 That Christ maie dvvell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in loue, 18 Maie be able to compre∣hend with all Saints, vvhat is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: 19 And to knovve the loue of Christ, vvhich passeth know∣ledge, that ye maie be filled vvith all fulnesse of God. For this thing sake I bow my knees vnto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, of whom all Fatherhood is named in Hea∣uen and in earth, that he would giue you, according to the riches of his glorie to be strengthe∣ned with power by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye might be rooted and grounded in loue, and maie be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, & length, and depth, and height: and to knowe the loue of Christ, which passeth (or is a∣boue) knowledge, that ye might be filled with all fulnesse of God. THis is the third part of this Chapter, conteining a te∣stimonie or witnesse-bearing of Saint Paules praier for the Ephesians, which praier hath thrée circumstaun∣ces, the first whereof is concerning God, whom Saint Paule doth call vpon, who is the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. The second conteineth a reason why God alone should be called vpon: to wit, because vpon him alone all fatherlie rule & gouernment doth depend, both in hea∣uen and also in earth. The word (Fatherhood) is héere taken for fatherlie rule & gouernment. Now, seing he a∣lone is to be called vpon, in whose power the ordering of
all things is, it followeth, that the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ alone must be called vpon. But yet, this speach doth not exclude the Sonne and the holie Ghost: because there is one diuine essence or béeing, power, and glorie of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost. The third circumstance conteineth a rehearsall of those things, which the Apostle wisheth to the Ephesians: to wit, that in the partaking and possessing of heauenlie things, they might be verie rich and plentifull. But the Apostle doth first make his rehearsall, and afterwards in the end compriseth all things in generall. But because in this point of doctrine, there is much to be marked, I will laie it downe in partes, to the end, that euerie thing maie the plainlier be considered, and the more easilie applied to our vse. The first part therefore of Saint Paules praier is contained in these words: (That he might graunt you, according to the riches of his glorie, that yee maie bee strengthened by his spirit, in the inner man.) Héere S. Paule wisheth to the Ephesians spirituall strength: and he sheweth the fountaine from whence euerie good thing floweth vnto all creatures: to wit, (The riches of his glorie,) that is to saie, the euerlasting & bottomlesse mer∣cie of God. When we are praieng therefore, what must wée doe? reckon vp our merits and deseruings? No, but boldlie trusting to Gods exceeding great goodnesse & cle∣mencie, we must praie with faith in Christ. So praieth Dauid,Psal. 51. 1. saieng: Miserere, &c. Haue mercie vpon me, O God, according to thy great mercie, & according to the multitude of thy mercies. He addeth the cause efficient, or the working cause, which is inward: to wit, the ho∣lie Ghost, wherby we are strengthened: & what maner of strength it is, which he wisheth vnto them, he expresseth in these words, saieng: (That your inner man may bee strong in the Lord.) Now, our inner man is our soule,
so farre forth as it is broken and trained vp in obedience vnto God: such a soule as mindeth inward things, and not outward, eternall & heauenlie things, not temporall and earthlie things. The studies and endeuours of the out∣ward man are diuerse from this. For he neglecting that which is inward and heauenlie, is buisie in outward, temporall, and earthlie toies and trash. The second circumstance is declared in these words: (That Christ maie dwell in your hearts by faith.) This circumstance sheweth plainlie from whence the strength of Christians doth come. For it defineth our strength, to be Christ himselfe. But how? Euen by dwelling in vs. How is this dwelling brought to passe? Euen by faith. Where, or in what part of vs? Euen in our hearts. For it is not inough to haue a kinde of knowledge of Christ, it skils not what, or how: but the affection of the heart must be present, which is a stedfast confidence in Christ, with which confidence béeing armed, we cannot be ouer∣come, but are able to withstand hell gates, according to that saieng of S. Iohn,1. Iohn. 5. 4 Haec est victoria, &c. This is the victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith. This place deserueth chieflie to be marked. For it doth not onelie teach, that Christ dwelleth by faith in them that belieue: but it disproueth the Papists, which define faith to be a certaine knowledge and agréeing to theThe meaning of this place is before set dovvne. sto∣rie, without confidence of heart. The third circumstance, (That ye maie be rooted and grounded in loue,) teacheth vs what is the force of faith, in respect of our neighbour. For, so soone as he had made mention of faith, by and by hée setteth downe the effect or fruite of the same: to wit, true and heartie loue towardes our neighbour: which hée doth for a double purpose: namelie, to shewe the true qualitie of faith: and also to teach vs, in what thing the perfection of Christi∣ans doth consist. But what manner of loue doth faith require? Forsooth, such a loue as is rooted and grounded:
that is to saie, such a loue as is sound & steddie, which is not moued & made to vanish like smoke, vpon euerie light occasion. Héerehence let vs learne, that how much more we profit and doe good in the schoole of Christ: so much more we growe and increase in the workes of loue, and are, as it were rooted. For it cannot bée, that he should be voide of loue, which possesseth Christ truelie by faith. The fourth circumstance is, (That yee maie be able to comprehend with all Saintes, what is the breadth, & length, and depth, and higth:) to wit, of the mysterie of Gods grace, and Christs loue towards vs. For so the Apostle expoundeth himselfe, saieng: That ye maie know the vnmesurable loue of Christ towards you. For as the mercie of God the Father passeth all his workes, accor∣ding to the wordes of Dauid:Psal. 145. 9 so the loue of God the Sonne, is beyond all measure also. For, if thou beholdest the breadth thereof, it cannot be compassed within anie boundes: if thou considerest the length thereof, it reach∣eth euen to all the ends of the world: if thou cast thine eies vpon the deapth thereof, it stoopeth downe, euen to the vilest and basest things in the world: if thou looke a∣loft vpon the higth thereof, it is farre aboue the heauens. This is the plaine and true meaning of this place: as for the trifles and toies of the Lordes woodden crosse, and of the round globe or compasse of the whole worlde, let vs leaue them, they are nothing: and therefore let them goe. This place ministreth a most fruitfull comfort against all lets and impediments, which séeme to hinder our sal∣uation. For, if Christ loueth vs so déerelie, it cannot be, (so that we abide in him by faith, euen to the end) that any creture should cast a blocke betwéene vs & our saluation. The fift circumstance, (That ye maie be filled with all fullnesse of GOD) comprehendeth in a summe, whatsoeuer belongeth to that perfection and fulnesse, which GOD requireth of vs. Nowe, the fulnesse
of God, is Christian perfection, whereby we doe fullie, that is to saie, without colourable dissembling and hy∣pocrisie, submit our selues vnto God. Such are all they, which kéepe the faith, and a good conscience. Héerehence we learne, in what things Christians must chieflie finde themselues occupied: namelie, in labouring more and more to come by perfection. For there is none, that hath profited and done so much good in the schoole of Christ, but hath néede of increase. Héere therefore is their vanitie and péeuishnesse reproued, which hauing scarslie had anie smacke at all of things belonging to God; and sauouring of heauenlie wisdome, thinke none so spiritu∣all as themselues, not once minding to profit anie more, or to goe forward anie whit at all. Verses. 20. & 21. 20 Vnto him therefore that is able to doe exceeding abun∣dantlie, aboue all that vve aske or thinke, according to the povver that vvorketh in vs, 21 Be praise in the Church by Christ Iesus, throughout all ge∣nerations for euer, Amen. But vnto him that is able to doe most abundantlie aboue all that we aske or thinke, accor∣ding to his power working in vs, euen vnto him bee glorie in the Church by Iesus Christ, through out all generations from age to age, Amen. THis is the fourth part of this Chapter, conteining a praising or glorifieng of Gods name, whereinto the Apostle falleth, anon after he had made rehearsall of Gods benefits. For, the whole benefit of our redemption serueth héereto, that all glorie might be giuen to God. Wherefore the Apostle (surelie verie well) hath shut vp the first part of his Epistle with thankesgiuing. Furthermore, bicause there are diuerse circumstances of this place, let vs consider and skanne them seuerallie. The first is, a making mention of Gods (Power) where∣by he is able to do all things whatsoeuer hée will: and
will performe all things whatsoeuer he hath promised. This (Power) of God should first of all establish our hope touching Gods promises, then it should be sette against the Diuell, death, and hell: yea, against the subtile rea∣sons of the flesh, whereby the faith of weaklings is of∣tentimes shaken. Besides these, it should stirre vs vp to the feare of God: for God by his (Power) can punish the stubburne, and make them stoope. Lastlie, it maie bée laide in their waie, which erroniouslie and blasphemous∣lie robbe God of his glorie, and giue the same to Saintes and Idols. The second is a mention making of Gods liberalitie, who bestoweth vpon vs farre greater benefites, than ei∣ther we can craue or conceiue. This ought not onelie to pricke vs vnto thanksgiuing: but to kindle in vs a grea∣ter and a feruenter faith. The third, from whence the desire and delight in vs to praie doth procéed and come: namelie from hence, be∣cause the (Power) of God is forceable in vs: which (Pow∣er) doubtlesse, is not of flesh, or bloud, but of the spirit of God, and of faith. The fourth is a pointing out (as it were) of the place, where true glorie maie be giuen to God, which is the Church of the Saintes, or congregation of the faith∣full. For the Church is a certaine Theatre in the world, whereon God will haue his glorie shewed and séene, according to that saieng of Dauid: Laus eius in Ecclesia Sanctorum,Psal. 149. 1 His praise bee in the congregation of Saints. The fift is a declaring of the meane or waie, where∣by glorie ought to be giuen unto God, (By Christ Iesus,) saith the Apostle. For none can giue praise and glorie to God, vnlesse they be in Christ by faith. Therefore saith Saint Ambrose, Per Christum, &c. Through Christ we must giue God thanks, because God giueth vs all things through Christ.
The sixt is the continuance and long lasting of the praise and glorie which is to be giuen to God. (Through out all generations, saith the Apostle, for euer, Amen.) This euerlasting praise and glorie of God, putteth vs in minde of two things. The first is, that we which are the members of Christ, should perpetuallie and for euer praise and glorifie God in Christ, after the example of Dauid,Psal. 119. 164. who saith thus: Septies in die, &c. Seuen times a daie I haue song praises vnto thee, bicause of the iudge∣ments of thy righteousnesse. The second is, that we should knowe, that the Church of God shall perpetuallie and for euer remaine, and neuer haue end. For, if glorie and praise must be giuen to God (For euer), & that can∣not be done else-where, saue in the Church, it followeth that the Church shall neuer be put downe, or come to an end. Then séeing it is so, it shall be preserued and maintained héere in this world, till the daie of iudgement: and also after the resurrec∣tion of all flesh it shall continue in all eternitie and euerla∣stingnesse, praising and glorifieng God for euer.
¶THE FOVRTH CHAPTER. ¶THE SVMME OF THE fourth Chapter. OYe Ephesians, forsomuch as ye are called vnto so great grace, méet & requisite it is, that in harmelesnes and vprightnesse of life ye aunswere so holie a calling. Wherefore I exhort you, that yée abandon all Gentilis∣me or heathenishnesse, and endeuour your selues to holi∣nesse of life. ¶THE ORDER OF THE fourth Chapter. AFter Doctrine the Apostle addeth exhortations, ac∣cording to the manner of the Prophets and Apostles: and first he setteth downe a generall proposition: to wit, That the Ephesians should walke worthy their vocation. Then, like a workman, by litle & litle he procéedeth from the causes, and gathereth in what the whole summe con∣sisteth: namelie, in mutuall loue: wherevnto he ioineth reasons. But least anie should abuse the excellencie of gifts, to the contempt and despite of their neighbours, hee sheweth the end of those gifts▪ wherwith Christ doth beau∣tifie his Church. To this also he addeth manie specialties, which in a full proposition, as in a generalitie, are con∣teined, and interlaceth comparisons of vertues and vices. He putteth them in minde of their former state vnder Gentilisme or heathenishnesse, to the end that the filthi∣nesse of their offences béeing discouered and knowne, they should giue themselues to holinesse of life, and a∣bandon vices. And so, as the former part of the Epi∣stle is didascalicall, that is to saie, tending to instruc∣tion, and conteineth the doctrine of saluation freelie gi∣uen: euen so the latter part thereof is paraineticall,
that is to saie, standeth vpon exhortation, and frameth vn∣to vs a Christian life. ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE fourth Chapter, with the obseruation of doctrines therein contained. Verses. 1. 2. &. 3. 1 I therefore beeing prisoner in the Lord, praie you, that ye vvalke vvorthie of the vocation vvherevnto yee are called, 2 With all humblenesse of minde, and meeknesse, vvith long suffering, supporting one an other through loue, 3 Endeuouring to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bonde of peace. I therefore, which am in bonds for the Lordes sake, exhort you that yee walke worthie of the calling wherewith yee are cal∣led, in all lowlinesse and meek∣nesse, with long suffering, for∣bearing one an other, in loue, doing your diligence to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace. THe proposition standeth vpon exhortation or persuasion. For the Apostle exhorteth and persuadeth the Ephesians, to the lea∣ding of a life worthie of the Gospel. In this proposition there are manie things to be marked. First, the Apostle maketh mention of his imprisonment, & that not onelie to declare his affection towards the Ephesians: who, although hée was cast into prison for the Gospels sake, yet he did not ceasse to exhort them to things seruing for their saluati∣on: but also that he might grow in countenance & credit among them, for whose sake he feared not to aduenture the vttermost dangers. In this place therefore let the mi∣nisters of the Gospell be admonished, of the lot & crosse, that is common to them all, which they are compelled to beare, through the tyrannie of this vnthankfull world: & by the example of S. Paule, let them learne to be constant, least through accustomed vnthankfulnesse they renounce their profession, & leaue the standing wherein God hath
placed them.  to suffer for the professi∣on of ; but rather an exceeding glorie. For to  the greatest daungers of all, with a willing mind, for the gospell sake, is a certeine seale (as it were) of their doctrine. Secondlie, when the Apostle saith, (I praie you that you walke worthie of the vocation wherevnto ye are called,) he compriseth in a summe, what beséemeth Chri∣stians, which are called to the partaking of heauenlie grace. Now, in this place that generall vocation or cal∣ling of all Christians is to be vnderstood, whereby we are called from darknesse, to light: from sinne, to righte∣ousnesse: from cursse, to blessing: from death, to life: from damnation, to iustification and saluation: from hell, to heauen: to be short, from the kingdome of the Diuell, which is full of all kinde of miseries, to the glo∣rious kingdome of Christ. This wonderfull chaunging of our condition, ought worthilie to stirre vs vp to thank∣fulnesse. For, if in the world, he that dischargeth his of∣fice notablie, and is aduaunced into higher place of pro∣motion, thinketh it a filthie thing, to staine his degrée of honour with some fowle fault: and on the other side, who soeuer outreacheth the rest, in vertue & noble déeds, brin∣geth the more beautie and renowme to his place: what shall we saie of them, which haue obteined this dig∣nitie, to be called and counted not onelie Holie Prophets, Kings, or Spirituall Priests: but also The children of God. This necessitie therefore of chaunging the condi∣tion of our former state, being badde, into a better, is di∣ligentlie to be considered, that it might stirre vs vp to lead a life worthie of so great and excellent a calling, in all sobernesse, righteousnesse, and holinesse. For we are called (as Saint Paule saith elsewhere) Not vnto filthi∣nesse,1. Cor. 1. 2. but vnto sanctification and holinesse.2. Cor. 7. 1. Héereto serueth that place also of the Apostle to Titus:1. Thes. 4. 7 Apparu∣it gratia,Tit. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14. &c. The grace of God, that bringeth saluation
vnto all men, hath appeared: and teacheth vs that we should denie vngodlinesse, and worldlie lusts, and that we should liue soberlie, and righteouslie, and godlie in this present world: looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glorie of the mightie God, and of our Sauiour Iesus Christ: who gaue himselfe for vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and purge vs to be a peculiar people vnto himselfe, zealous of good workes. Thirdlie, because the Apostle is exhorting the Ephe∣sians to (Vnitie of spirit,) that is to saie, to concord and agréement, he laieth the foundations thereof, whiles he requireth at their hands, (Humblenesse of minde, meeknesse, long suffering, and bearing one with an other through loue.) Of these Christian vertues I will saie somewhat, to the ende that the differencies and properties of them maie the better be seene and knowne. (Humblenesse,) which the Greekes call , is a vertue of the minde, which doth so rule a god∣lie man, that he thinketh not too well, either of himselfe, or of his giftes: but rather abaseth himselfe vnder all men, in the feare of God, giuing to God all glorie and praise. This vertue is the verie next fruite of true re∣pentaunce, which taketh vnto it dailie new increasings, so that it be true and naturall, and not false and counter∣fait. Now, this holie (Humblenesse) increseth & groweth by foure things. The first is, by the acknowledgement of our owne vnablenesse and weaknesse. The second is, by considering the ende of Gods giftes, which he hath gi∣uen vs: for our giftes are diuerse. And why? Euen that the benefite of them maie be common: that is to saie, to the edifieng one of another, in the bodie of Christ. The third is, by binding our selues to serue others, according to the parable in the Gospell. For, Of him which hath more, more shall be required. The fourth is, by think∣ing
throughlie vpon Gods counsell, purpose, and proui∣dence, who oftentimes bringeth to passe, that they which séeme to haue but small giftes, bestowe more trauell in building vp Gods Church, than they which excell in di∣uersitie of gifts. (Meeknesse) followeth Humblenesse aptlie, after the Apostles order: and it is the childe as it were of Hum∣blenesse. Now, (Meeknesse,) which the Greekes call , is a kind of calmenesse in the mind, whereby as anie one bridleth himselfe from being angrie or wroth: so he sheweth himselfe gentle and faire spoken to others. The contraries to this, are fiercenesse, madness, fro∣wardnesse, stubbornesse, waiwardnesse, and such like vi∣ces, which turne the calmenesse of the minde, into a storme and tempest. (Long suffering,) which the Greekes call : the Latinists, Longanimitas: is a companion of Méeknesse: and it is a certeine mildenesse of the minde, giuing place vnto wrong, and parting from ones owne right, for quietnesse sake. For so Saint Paule séemeth to define this vertue, when he addeth these words, (Sup∣porting one another through loue, endeuouring to keepe the vnitie of the spirit,) that is, the concord or agrée∣ment of mindes, (In the bond of peace.) For loue knit∣teth vs together as it were with linkes: euen as the members of the bodie, béeing fastened together by ioints, are ruled by one spirit. When therefore the heart is reformed by Gods spirit, and brought vnder, by true humblenesse, méekenesse, and long suffering, we shall then well inough awaie with others, amend them that haue done amisse, and also loue one ano∣ther with true loue, according to the Lords comman∣dement. This place of the Apostle is diligentlie to be mar∣ked. For he sheweth, at what thing the true agréement of mindes in the Saints must take beginning: namelie,
at the rooting out of all such vices, as are plagues to con∣cord and vnitie: such are these, hawtinesse, hastinesse, fro∣wardnesse, fiercenesse, waiwardnesse, &c. Heereto serueth the saieng of Solomon,Pro. 13. 10 Onelie by pride doth man make contention.Matt. 11. 29. And Christ saith, Learne of me, because I am meeke and humble in heart. In which words Christ commandeth the bridling of two affections: namelie, de∣sire of reuengement, and pride. For as (Humblenesse) of heart is flat against pride: so is (Meeknesse) flat a∣gainst desire of reuengement. Christ saith, that the bri∣deling of these affections, is the bearing of his yoke. For he that hath found rest in Christ, and a refreshing after his labours, & an acquittance from the Lawe which con∣demneth, ought not therevpon to take libertie to sinne: but , being raised vp and comforted by the grace of Christ, to take vp Christs yoke, and to chaine in the lewd lusts of the flesh. This yoke of Christ shall not then be cumbersome or tedious vnto vs, but easie and light, when we are once vsed to (Meeknesse and humblenesse,) after his example, being propt vp with true confidence and beliefe in him. Contrariwise, such as hold scorne to carrie the yoke of Christ, let them hardlie (euen as they deserue) be made subiect to the rule and power of the Diuell, and lie tro∣den vnder his féete. For it cannot otherwise be, but that euerie one of vs must beare the yoke, either of Christ, or else of Christs aduersarie. Verses. 4. 5. &. 6. 4 There is one bodie, & one spirit, euen as ye are called in one hope of your vocation. 5 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptisme. 6 One God and Father of all, vvhich is aboue all, & through , and in you all. There is one bodie and one spirit, euen as ye are also called in one hope of your calling. There is ou one Lord, one faith, one baptisme, one God and Father all which is aboue all, and through all, and in you all.
THis is a confirmation of the proposition, wherein is set downe before vs, a heape of reasons or argu∣ments, all which hang vpon this one principle: That which is one, ought in no case to be at strife and debate with it selfe. The assumption or minor is this: The Church is one: héervpon followeth the conclusion, which is this, Ergo the Church ought in no case to be at strife & debate with it selfe. The assumption or minor, because it is to be proued, is confirmed with store of reasons. But that all things maie be knowne at the full, we will consider euerie thing by it selfe seuerallie, and that briefelie. First therefore he saith, that (There is one bodie, and one spirit,) that is to saie, Euen as Christians are the members of one and the selfe same bodie:1. Co. 12. 12 so it is meete, that they being quickened by one and the selfe same spi∣rit, should agree together in holie loue. For, as all the members of one and the selfe same bodie, are quickened and gouerned by one and the selfe same spirit: euen so must all Christians behaue themselues one towards a∣nother, that they maie seeme to be lead and guided by one minde & heart, séeing they are all but one bodie in Christ. Whosoeuer therefore departeth from vnitie and con∣cord, he must néeds depart from the bodie of Christ, which is the Church. Héerevpon it followeth, that they, which mainteine not stedfastlie holie loue and vnitie among themselues, doe boast and bragge of the title of the Church, all in waste. And least we should suffer our selues to be with∣drawne and pluckt awaie from the Church, vnder a vaine shewe & counterfaite colour of vnitie, let vs marke the reason of vnitie, which followeth: (Euen as ye are called in one hope of your vocation,) saith the Apostle: that is to saie, I would so haue you all to be one, euen as ye are called to one and the selfe same inheritance, which at this instant ye possesse by hope, according to the word
of your calling. It is the Apostles will therefore, that we should not depart from the word of our calling, that is to saie, from the pure doctrine of our calling, from whence the soundation of loue and vnitie must be fetcht. For he that departeth from the Gospell, whereby God calleth: he departeth from the vnitie of the Church, from the which when a man is once separated, it cannot be that he should be gouerned by the spirit: euen as anie member or limme of the bodie, being cut off from the bo∣die, is no more ruled by the life, which is in the bodie. Now followeth the heape of reasons. (There is one Lord,) to wit, of the Catholike or vniuersall Church: namelie, Christ Iesus, whom all the faithfull ought of dutie to serue, in vnitie of spirit, and agréement of mind. For, if it be a fowle and reprochfull thing, that house∣hold seruaunts, which haue but one and the selfe same earthlie maister, should fall out and brall among them∣selues: and not rather with one consent & agréement do that which they are commanded: what (I beséech you) shall be more fowle and reprochfull, than that Christi∣ans, which haue but one maister in heauen, the Lord Ie∣sus Christ, should be at disagréement & defiaunce among themselues? speciallie, séeing there is (But one faith) of all in him, whereby they staie and rest themselues vpon him alone, being the onelie Lord and alone redéemer of all: which (Faith) indéed, séeing it is but one and the selfe same: that is to saie, of one and the selfe same pro∣mise: it is méete, that they to whom this (One faith) is giuen, should also maintaine among themselues, one vnitie, or onenesse. To this also belongeth that which followeth. (One baptisme:) to wit, common to all, whereby we are in∣graffed into Christs bodie, & as it were incorporate with him. (One God and Father of all, which is aboue all, and through all, and in you all:) that is to saie, which ruleth ouer all, and by his prouidence and gouernment ordereth
and disposeth all, dwelling in all the godlie by faith. And although these words, (Aboue all, & through all,) maie be referred to the vniuersall gouernment and rule of all things: yet the circumstanunce of the place maketh a re∣straint, so that they are to be applied to the Church, chief∣lie in this place. The meaning of the words therfore is this, (Aboue all) noteth the souereigne rule of one God ouer the Church: (Through all,) betokeneth his pro∣uidence ouer spreading all and euerie member of the Church: (In all) signifieth the coupling or knitting of vs together with Christ. Whosoeuer therefore break∣eth brotherlie loue or agréement, he neither knoweth nor confesseth these thrée doctrines. To be briefe, whosoeuer is not moued with these reasons and arguments of vni∣tie, to desire and endeuour to liue in loue and concord, we maie well enough thinke that he or she hath not so much as one little crumbe of the same in them. Verse. 7. 7 But vnto euerie one of vs is giuen grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. But vnto euerie one of vs grace is giuen, according to the measure of Christs gift. THis is a figure called Prolepsis, and maie be called in English, Presumption, whereby the Apostle cutteth off a quarrellous demand. If all things, which are héere rehearsed, are common the Christians, how then commeth it to passe, that we are not equall in giftes belonging to the Church? Why hath this man a greater gifte, and that man a lesser? Surelie this vnequall giuing of giftes, is the séede of strife and en∣uie: as maie be séene in the Corinthians, and in manie others. The Apostle answereth, that grace is giuen to euerie one, euen as it pleaseth Christ, who bestoweth his gifts,
not onelie to the priuate vses of euerie one for himselfe, but also to the profite, maintenaunce, and preseruation of the whole bodie: to wit, that one should edifie another with their gifts, in the bodie of Christ. Hauing therefore shewed the authour and giuer of diuerse gifts in the Church, he cutteth off all matter of boasting, and all cause of despising others, which séeme to haue receiued smaller gifts. If manie would consider this well, they would not swell so much in their owne wisedome, but euerie one would serue other the more, with their gifts, through loue. Let vs therefore learne héerehence, to be content both with our estate, and giftes: and to laie out vpon the edifieng one of another, whatsoeuer giftes the Lord of life hath lent vs. Verse. 8. 8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended vp on high, he lead cap∣tiuitie captiue, and gaue giftes vnto men. VVherefore he saith, VVhen he ascended vp on high, he lead captiuitie captiue, and gaue gifts vnto men. BY the testimonie of Dauid he proueth, that Christ is the Author of all such giftes, as euerie seuerall mem∣ber hath in the Church. Now this testimonie is well to be marked, because it conteineth a Prophesie concerning the triumph of Christ ascending vp into heauen, which triumph Dauid sawe in spirit, a thousand yeares before it came to passe. This testimonie is taken out of the 68. Psalme, which is a praising of Christ triumphant, whom Dauid confesseth openlie to be Iehouah,Psal. 68. 4. that is, the true God. Furthermore, this verse of the Apostle, borrowed of Dauid, conteineth two things. The first, a Prophesie of Christs ascending into heauen. The seconde, a double fruite of his glorious ascending: the first whereof is, his
triumph ouer death, sinne, hell, and the Diuels king∣dome, which is to be vnderstood vnder this word (Capti∣uitie.) This triumph, as it began in Christ our head: so it shall be ended in the rest of his bodie, which is his Church, at such time as we shall all rise againe, at the commaundement and voice of Christ. For then shall all the godlie enioie euerlasting victorie with Christ, their enimies béeing vanquished and shaken off with shame. The thinking vpon this our triumph to come, ought of right to comfort vs, when we be kept vnder the Crosse. For he, which is certaine of a glorious deliuerance, set∣teth lesse by his present gréeuance. The second fruit of the Lordes ascending, which the Apostle toucheth, is conteined in these words, (And gaue gifts vnto men.) For, to this purpose Christ ascended, that he might deale gifts vnto his Church, whereby shée might be edified & maintained in this life. For, as on the day of Pentecost, he sent the holie Ghost downe to his A∣postles, appearing in a visible shape vnto them, & likewise gaue them power against the Diuell and his members: euen so at this daie also, the same Lord Iesus beautifieth his Church with diuerse gifts, and he alone mainteineth the same, neuer purposing to forsake and leaue her vnprouided. Héerehence therefore let vs fetch comfort, when wée lie groning vnder the Crosse. For, although the Diuell setteth vpon the Church, with sundrie kindes of engines, & by subtile snares violentlie rusheth vpon euerie mem∣ber of the same: yet shall he not in triumph tread still vpon her necke, & kéepe her vnder alwaies, though shée be held downe for a time. For Christ is the triumpher, who sitting at the right hand of God, maintaineth his Church, defendeth her, and strengtheneth her: yea, hée comforteth all and euerie one of her members with his holie spirit.
Verses. 9. &. 10. 9 Novv, in that he ascended, vvhat is it, but that he had also descended first into the lovvest parts of the earth? 10 He that descended, is euen the same that ascended, farre a∣boue all heauens, that he might fill all things. Now, that hee ascended, what meaneth it, but that hee also descended first into the lower partes of the earth. Hee that descended, is euen the selfe same that ascended aboue all heauens, that hee might fill all things. THese words must be read in a Parenthesis. For, out of the testimonie of the Psalmist alreadie cited, the Apostle gathereth two things, by the figure of Digressi∣on. The one is of Christs abasing: the other of his glo∣rifieng. For, in that (He ascended) he signifieth that (His descending), that is to saie, his abasing went before, which came to passe, by taking vpon him mans nature, by his passion, and by his death. This argument or rea∣son of the Apostle were altogether weake, if hée had not vnderstood and knowne, that the word which was in the beginning, and euerlasting, abased himselfe, in taking vp∣on him the shape of a seruaunt, wherein hée was also mad? obedient euen to the death of the crosse. Againe, in that he (Ascended), Saint Paule gathereth the glorifi∣eng of Christ, and his power, whereby hee now ful∣filleth all things, which make for the perfect estate of his Church. Moreouer, they which out of this place doe conclude, that Christ descended and went downe into hell, and to the place of the damned, build (God wot) vpon a verie weake foundation. For, the Apostle heere doth not make a comparison of one part of the earth to an other: but compareth the whole earth with heauen, as if he should saie: The eternall word vouchsafed to come downe from his heauenlie glorie, vnto vs miserable men, which liue and are conuersant héere in earth, that he might be made man, and become an oblation for mankinde.
Furthermore, because the Lord is heere said, (To haue ascended farre aboue all heauens,) there are some which gather thervpon, that the bodie of Christ is , not limitable. For (as they saie) aboue the heauens there is no place. But as for this subtile shift, let vs leaue it to Sophisters and Questionists: and let vs constantlie kéepe and sticke to the Articles of our beliefe, wherin we confesse, that Christ was verie man, & ceaseth not yet so to be: wherefore it is true, that he hath a verie bodie, li∣mitable: and a verie soule, limitable likewise, where∣with he shall come at the latter daie to iudge the quicke & the dead. For, he ascended not to chaunge the nature of his manhood, into the nature of his Godhead: but, as the Apostle saith (I'o fill all things), and that by the maiestie and power of his godhead, wherewith he will be present with vs, euen to the ende of the world, according to his promise. Héereof the Catholike Church of Christ beareth wit∣nesse with vs. Saint Augustine saith, Sed quoniam, &c. But bicause that is true,Mat. 28. 20. which hee speaketh: Beholde, I am with you euen to the end of the world, he is both gone from vs, and he is heere among vs, and he is come againe vnto vs, and he hath not lefte or forsaken vs. For he carried his bodie with him into heauen, he toke not awaie his maiestie out of the world. Touching this, read more in the Historie of Christ, which we haue written vpon the first Chapter of Saint Iohn. Furthermore, this place of Saint Paule serueth vn∣to this end, euen that we, by the example of Christ, should be abased and humbled, and one serue an others néede through loue, looking for the communion and partaking of Christs glorie: we (I saie) which héere on earth, after Christs example, succour and make one of an other, and edifie them with diuerse and sundrie duties and seruices in the bodie of Christ.
Verses. 11. 12. 13. 11 He therefore gaue some to be Apostles, and some Pro∣phets, and some Euangelistes, and some Pastours, and Tea∣chers. 12 For the gathering together of the Saints, for the vvorke of the ministerie, & for the edifi∣cation of the bodie of Christ, 13 Till we all meere together, (in the vnitie of faith, & know∣ledge of the sonne of God,) vn∣to to a perfect man, and vnto the measure of the age of the ful∣nesse of Christ. And he in deede gaue some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Euangelists, and some Pastours, (or Shepheards,) & some Doctours, (or Teachers) for the restoring of the Saints to the worke of the ministerie, and to the edifieng of the bodie of Christ, till we all meete to∣gether in the vnitie of faith & knowledge of the sonne of God, vnto a perfect man, to the mea∣sure of the age of Christes fulnesse. THis is a rehearsall of the giftes, wherewith Christ chieflie beautifieth his Church: and it is a significati∣on also of the end whie these gifts are giuen, and where∣to they are ordeined. The gifts are these, (Apostles, Pro∣phets, Euangelists, Pastours, and Teachers.) Although the last ende of these be all one: to wit, (The edification of the bodie of Christ:) yet their offices and charge is diuerse, as in the descriptions of them shall be decla∣red. The (Apostles) were the verie next men immediatlie chosen of Christ, appointed and ordeined to teach & preach the Gospell, and that not in some certaine place, but eue∣rie where throughout the whole world, according to this commaundement of Christ,Mark. 16. 15. Ite in vniuersum, &c. Go ye ouer all the world, & preach the Gospell to euerie crea∣ture, &c. Such were those twelue, which are also peculi∣arlie called by the names of (Apostles.) To these was S. Paule also afterwards ioined,Mat. 10. 2 3. 4. who was chieflie appointed an (Apostle) for the Gentiles, that he might carrie the name of Christ among them. But, bicause this order and degrée of men was made, that by them God might haue
his Churches gathered together and established through∣out the whole compasse of the world: therefore ceassed they (the Apostles I meane) when the Churches were thus by them set in order and edified. Of (Prophets) we maie make two orders, whereof the one was in the olde Testament, the other in the new. The (Prophets) of the olde Testament were they, which béeing taught by speciall reuelation from Hea∣uen, euen of God himselfe, prophesied of things to come: which when they came to passe, warranted the hea∣rers of their wordes, that their propheticall doctrine was not voide of truth. The euents therefore, and fal∣lings out of their prophesies, and the successes of the same, were certaine seales of that heauenlie doctrine which they deliuered to the Church. The (Prophets) in the new Testament, were men indued with singu∣lar wisedome, whose charge and office it was, not one∣lie to expounde the Scriptures, but also to gouerne and keepe in order the Churches, which the Apostles had assembled and edified: and that one while in one place, an other while in an other place, euen as it plea∣sed the Apostles. This order therefore was likewise temporall, and had but his time. The (Euangelists) were companie-kéepers with the Apostles. For the Apostles ioined the (Euangelistes) with them, for the easing of their labours. And although these also preached the Gospell, as the Apostles did: yet notwithstanding, they were of a lower degrée than the Prophets. Such were Titus, Syluanus, Apollo, Marcus, Lucas, and Timothie, whom Saint Paule exhorteth to doe the woorke of an (Euangelist:2. Tim. 4. 5) which worke appeareth to haue bene inioined to the A∣postles, in bestowing their trauell in preaching the Gos∣pell of Christ euerie where. The (Euangelists) there∣fore were not sent next & immediatlie of Christ, as the Apostles were. They had not the ouer sight and rule of
the Churches, now these, now those, which the Apostles had planted, as the Prophets did: but they were the A∣postles companions onelie, whose helpe and seruice they vsed, in the discharging of their office. And although that the name of an (Euangelist) signifieth generallie, anie Preacher of the Gospell, whom ye will: yet notwith∣standing, it is héere taken for one certaine charge and office, as we haue alreadie shewed. Sometimes also those foure, which wrote the historie of our Lorde Ie∣sus Christ, commonlie called the Gospelles, are named (Euangelistes), of whome two were likewise Apo∣stles: to wit, Saint Matthew, and Saint Iohn: and two were companie-kéepers with the Apostles: namelie, S. Marke, and Saint Luke. Those were (Pastours), whom at this daie we call the Rectors or Ministers of Parishes, (some, after the olde fashion, Parish Priests.) These were appointed and set ouer certaine Churches, that by preaching or ma∣king of Sermons, by ministring the Sacraments, and by a kinde of holie discipline and order, they should rule and gouerne them. These are not for a time, but for euer, euen to the daie of iudgement: their office is so néedfull in the Church. They are (Teachers,) whom the Church in olde time called by the name of Catechisers: whose office was to set downe a forme and order of doctrine, and to deliuer certaine foundations and grounds of doctrine, which the Pastours afterwards should tie themselues vnto, and di∣ligentlie folowe. Such are they which at this daie teach and instruct youth in schooles the principles and rules of Christian religion. These haue an eie to this: to wit, that true expounding, and right order in teaching, be kept in the Church. But although in the Apostles time, the ceremonie of promotion & preferment was not receiued, which at this daie is in vse: yet notwithstanding, thus much we must
knowe, that the godlie gouernors of Churches & schooles, ordeined degrées of promotions vpon good and profitable aduisement: both that the arrogant and hautie hearted, should not vsurpe and challenge vnto themselues the ti∣tle of honour and worship, without the iudgement of the Church: and also, that by open witnesse they might be warranted fit for that place & office, and growe in coun∣tenance and estimation. Neither is this against the dignitie of theOr Churches holie go∣uerne∣ment. ecclesiasticall Hierarchie: which the holie Ghost commendeth vnto vs. For, when the holie Ghost commendeth vnto the Ephesians an order and comelinesse to be kept, he leaueth vnto himselfe, the authoritie to establish and make rites and ceremonies, which doe tend vnto the kéeping of order and comeli∣nesse. There is no cause therefore, that we should care for the speaches of proud praters, (Diuels in déed,) which haue these degrées in contempt: so that they, on whome these degrées are bestowed, remember who they be that so despise them, and also bethinke them, that their places of preferment, are not signes or tokens of an arrogant ouerlooking and ouerruling of others: but rather open witnesses of their office and charge, which they owe vnto the Church: and to the performance where∣of they are bounde, as it were, by sacred and solemne oth. But the aduersaries peraduenture laie this in our waie. The Church of Christ should not be acquainted with pompe, she should not be skilfull in such things: let her haue the triall and examining of faith and holi∣nesse: let her haue praiers, and the laieng on of handes. I aunswere, that it is not a thing vnworthie for Chri∣stians, to bestowe vpon godlie and learned men, testimonies of their learning and honestie: that the Church should knowe, to whom shée might safelie com∣mit, and boldlie put in trust, the gouernement and charge
of doctrine. And although such manner of promotions haue bene a long time abused, that makes no matter: so that wée reserue and keepe in Churches and Schooles, such things as are profitable and necessarie: all drosse and dregges béeing cleansed quite awaie. Againe,Math. 23. 8. they trip vs in our talke, saieng, That the Lord did forbidde anie to be called Rabbi, and Maisters vpon earth, bicause there is but one Maister. I aun∣swere,Mat. 23. 9 that the same Lorde saith, wée must call none Father vpon earth: and yet he in his lawe giueth vs com∣mandement to honour our Fathers.Exod. 20. 12. Wherefore this is to bée vnderstoode,Mark. 7. 10. not of the name, but of some other thing which was forbidden. Besides this, the cirum∣stance of the place is sufficient disproofe against them, which sheweth what this forbidding meaneth. For this followeth,Mat. 23. 11. 12. Qui maximus, &c. Hee that is grea∣test amongest you, shall bee your Minister, Againe, Hee that exalteth himselfe,Luke. 14. 11. shall bee brought lowe. The Lordes will therefore was not by his forbid∣ding, to take awaie the name of Father, Maister, or Teacher: but all arrogant confidence, and selfe-liking in vs. Hée will not that wée sooth and smooth our selues, if wée séeme to excell others in some kinde of giftes. Hée will not that we proudlie preferre and thinke bet∣ter of our selues than of others: but that hée rather, which is the greatest, should shewe himselfe a minister vnto all. He will not that we shoulde deuise and set abroch a new and straunge doctrine, but that we shoulde faithfullie followe our onelie Maister Iesus Christ, in matters of saluation. Now, in that they laie load at vs with the saieng of S. Iames,Iam. 3. 1. Ne sitis multi magistri, &c. My bretheren, be not manie Maisters, knowing that we shall receiue the greater condemnation: that is soone aunswered. For Saint Iames to that his forbidding, addeth a reason, saieng: In multis, &c. For in manie things we sinne
all. So that the meaning of this inhibition or forbidding, is this: I would that ye should not be sharpe controllers of other mens manners. Now let vs come backe to the exposition of our text, where the Apostle setteth downe the end of those giftes, wherewith Christ hath and doth beautifie his Church. (For the gathering together of the Saints for the worke of the ministerie, and for the edification of the bodie of Christ.) To this ende belongeth all Christs bestow∣ing and giuing out of his gifts. This (Gathering toge∣ther of the Saints,) is called  in Gréeke, and signifieth properlie, a restoring or repairing of a thing decaied: as when the members of the bodie, as the bones, or such like, are loose, out of order, or beside their right place: but afterwards set in againe, fastened, and made sound and whole, that all and euerie part of the bodie, maie be in good making and liking. Héerehence Saint Paule, who compareth the Church to the bodie, applieth the word to the state of the Church well ordered and gouerned. The diuersitie of gifts ther∣fore, wherewith Christ beautifieth his Church, belongeth to the well ordering and gouerning of the Church. For to this thing, as it were to the proper end, these gifts are appointed. This followeth, (For the worke of the mi∣nisterie,) that we might knowe, what instrument Gods will is to vse, (For the gathering together of his Saints:) to wit, (The ministerie of the word.) Afterwards the Apostle expoundeth this (Gathering together of the Saints,) and calleth it, (The edification of the bodie of Christ,) concerning which we haue said sufficient in the second Chapter. Now followeth an amplification or enlargement, ta∣ken from the circumstance of the time, and the manner of (the edification of Christs bodie, Till we all meete together in the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the sonne of God:) that is to saie, Till we all are made one
in faith and in the knowledge of Christ. In that he saith, (Till we all meete together,) it is to good purpose. For he signifieth, that it is not one daies worke for all of vs to be made full and perfect in Christ: but that it must be our dailie labour, till at length we come to that vnitie of Christs bodie, the cause of which (Vnitie) is faith. This (Knowledge) is not a knowledge onelie of the minde concerning Christ, but also a confidence of the heart. For, it is not enough to knowe that Christ is God, man, one person in Trinitie, King, Prophet, and Priest: vnlesse with stedfast confidence and boldnesse we build vpon him. Héere the degrées of (Vnitie) must be marked, the first whereof is, the (Knowledge) of Christ: from whence (Faith) springeth. By this (Faith) we are in∣graffed into Christ, and made as it were of his bodie. eing therefore ingraffed into him, & made of his bodie, it is our part, like members of one & the selfe same bo∣die, to haue care & regard one of anothers health and good case, through loue: this (I saie) is our dutie, who are ioined together one with another among our selues, by the spirit of Christ. Out of these things therefore is to be gathered, that the (Vnitie) of the Church consist∣eth not in traditions of men, nor in ceremonies, but in the consent of true doctrine and faith, from whence the loue of one another doth spring. Moreouer, when it is said, (Vnto a perfect man, & vnto the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ,) the Apostle expresseth, by a notable & trimme Metaphore, the increase & growing of the Saints. For, as there are diuerse degrées of age: as, infancie, childhood, middleage, oldage, dotage, &c. so must Christians growe by litle and litle, in the faith & knowledge of Christ. They must not kéepe still at the nethermost steppe, and staie there: but they must goe vp higher and higher, till they come to perfectnesse: which notwithstanding they shall not ob∣teine
at full, before they, hauing put off the olde man, shalbe glorified both in soule and bodie, with a blessed life. These words therefore of the Apostle must not be referred to the bodie, which is but an idle lumpe: but to the light of the minde, and the affection of the heart: to wit, that we should knowe Christ trulie, and leane vp∣on him with a liuelie faith, that we should not be waue∣ring, like children, who by reason of their young yeares haue not a settled iudgement: but like men growne to full age, whose iudgement being steddie, they constantlie mainteine the truth. For, whatsoeuer is héere spoken of the bodie, and of the (Measure of age,) it is to be applied vnto the spirit, and the increase of the same. For, as the Lord himselfe grewe in bodie, till such time as he became (A perfect man,) and had the iust measure of his full age: euen so we must growe in faith, and the knowledge of Christ, till we are come to perfectnesse. This to be the true and naturall meaning of Saint Paules wordes, that which followeth is witnesse. For the Apostle is not in hand héere with our bodies, wherewith we shall rise a∣gaine: as some verie vnaduisedlie doe gather in this place. For that maketh neuer a whit for the drift of this present discourse. Verse. 14. 14 That vve hencefoorth be no more children, vvauering, and carried about with euerie vvinde of doctrine, by the de∣ceipt of men, and with crafti∣nesse, whereby they laie in waite to deceiue. That we should be children no more, to wauer, and be carri∣ed about with euerie blast of doctrine, by the wilinesse of men, by craftinesse, (or snares of deceipt.) THe Apostle declareth and sheweth the fruit of the sound knowledge of Christ, and of faith. For, the
sound knowledge of Christ, and a stedfast faith, streng∣then the minds of men against all such tempests, as the souldiers of Sathan, dare or shall raise vp against the Church. For, they that are not indued with the sound knowledge of Christ, and with faith, they easilie stagger, and reele. And as a little ship or small barke, not hauing a Pilot to rule and guide it, is driuen hether and thether with the waues and streame: or as a réede is shaken to and fro, according to the variablenesse of the winde: euen so they are carried awaie from true doctrine, by decei∣uers and Heretikes. We haue therefore commended vn∣to vs héere, the word, and an earnest studie and ende∣uour in the word, that thereby we maie be so confirmed, as not to suffer our selues to be withdrawne from the same, by anie craft or deceipt. Furthermore, he nameth two weapons, which decei∣uers vse against the Church: not that these are all, as though they had no more: but because these are the prin∣cipall & chiefe. The first is , which signifieth pro∣perlie, the casting of the dice, or dice-plaie, from whence Saint Paule borrowing it, applieth it vnto subtile sophi∣strie, or wittie wiles to wrest the scripture, and to de∣ceipts, wherewith the ignoraunt and vnlearned are ea∣silie insnared and taken. The second is , whereby is signified, a certeine kinde of craftinesse, or subtile fetching in of a man: when one doth all that he can for his life, by wiles to winde in another, and so to deceiue him. This the Apostles expoundeth himselfe, when he saith: (Whereby they laie in waite to deceiue,) that to saie, by which deceiptfull déede of theirs, and craftie dealing, they laie sore at men to drawe them from the truth. Let these things admonish vs, not onelie of the daunger that commeth by false teachers, which goe to worke all the waies they can, maliciouslie to turne men from the true knowledge of Christ, and from faith: & also of diligence
and endeuour, that we béeing established in true doc∣trine, maie be able both to defend our selues against all the snares of deceiuers, and also to stoppe their mouthes. Verse. 15. 15 But let vs follovve the truth in loue, and in all things grovve vp into him, vvhich is the head, that is Christ. But following the truth in loue, let vs grown vp in him through all things, which is the head, euen Christ. THis is an Antithesis, or opposition, to the former member. For as he made mention there, that we shuld take héede of false doctrine, and of snares which decei∣uers laie to choke the true doctrine: so héere he biddeth vs (Followe the truth,) that is to saie, sticke to the true doctrine, and in the faith. (For he vseth the figure Sy∣necdoche, whereby vnder the word (Truth) is also comprised the affection following, according to the man∣ner of the scripture,) (And in loue one towards another:) whereby it shall come to passe, that we shall (Growe vp into Christ himselfe,) , euerie waie, (In all things,) he béeing our head. For, how much more we growe in the knowledge of Christ, in faith, and (In loue:) so much more we growe in Christ. As children therefore growe by little and litle, till they are come to their perfect age: euen so it is the dutie of Christians, to growe daie by daie in the knowledge of Christ, in faith, and in loue, and neuer to cease till they haue gotten perfectnesse. All this serueth héereto, that we should submit our selues vnto Christ our head, and mainteine vnitie among vs one with another, as we are all ruled by one and the same spirit of Christ. Furthermore, Christ is said to be the head of the Church, in working, in perfection, in merit, and in order. In working, because he quickeneth, sustaineth, and
kéepeth the Church by his spirit. In perfection, because he excelleth both Angels and men in wisdome and righ∣teousnesse. In merite, because he hath taken awaie our sinnes by his obedience of the crosse: and by the obe∣dience of the lawe, hath made satisfaction to the righte∣ousnesse of God, that as manie as doe beléeue in him, should be counted righteous, through the righteousnesse of Christ. In order, bicause he is the Monarch and one∣lie Souereigne of the Church. Verse. 16. 16 By whom all the bodie beeing coupled and knit toge∣ther, by euerie ioint, for the furniture thereof, (according to the effectuall power, which is in the measure of euerie part,) receiueth increase of the bodie, vnto the edifieng of it selfe in loue. By whom the whole bodie bee∣ing coupled and knit together, by euerie ioint, wherewith one mini∣streth (or serueth) another, ac∣cording to the operation (or wor∣king) in measure of euerie part, causeth (or maketh) the increase of the bodie, vnto the edifieng of it selfe through loue. THe Apostle giueth a reason, why he calleth Christ the head of the Church: and the Church the bodie of Christ. Although this place appeareth at the first blush verie obscure and darke: yet notwithstanding, the meaning shall be verie easie, when the words are made plaine, and the similitude, which the Apostle doth not expresse héere, is also declared. He calleth the Church (A bodie,) howbeit not anie bodie, what ye will: but (A bodie knit together,) or (as Saint Paule speaketh more pithilie) , that is to saie, so knit and coupled together, that it maie well and fitlie be ioined to the head: euen as an house built and raised vpon the foundation, by the rule and square of the workeman. Vnder this word therefore, the relation of the bodie to the head, that is to saie, of the Church vnto Christ, is meant, and vnderstood.
Afterwards, the Apostle saith, that the Church is (A bodie knit together by ioints:) the Gréeke word is, , that is to say, so coupled & fastened, that the members of the same hang one vpon another in due proportion, and agrée verie well together. And thus the relation and proportion of the members betwéene themselues, one with another, is signified (as you sée,) vnder this word. He saith this bodie is (Knit toge∣ther by euerie ioint, for the furniture thereof:) that is to saie, by ioints, which carrie breath and life from one limme to another: which breath and life is dispersed from the head, through all and euerie member of the bodie, euen by the benefite and good seruice of the ioints, by whose meanes the members of the bodie, hang one by another, (According to the effectuall power of eue∣rie part,) that is to saie, of euerie member. For some members receiue, and haue more breath and life from the head than other some, whereby the whole bodie ta∣keth increase. Now, the similitude shalbe easier to vnderstand. As the bodie of man is to the head, euen so is the Church of Christ vnto Christ her head: but the bodie of man ioined vnto the head, & knit together by ioints in euerie mem∣ber, by due proportion and order, receiueth all breath and life from the head: Ergo the Church of Christ ioined vn∣to Christ her head by faith, and made fit by sundrie sorts of seruices & vses of loue betwéene themselues, as it were members, draweth all ablenesse, and life from her head, euen Christ Iesus. Or if you please, frame the simili∣tude in this manner. As breath and life descending or comming downe from the braine, by and through the sinewes, veines, and artires, bringeth féeling and liueli∣nesse vnto all the members, according to the propor∣tion of euerie one in his kinde: euen so Christ giueth vnto vs, who are his members, his gifts, and that not at
happe hazard or rashlie, but according to the measure of euerie member: that is to saie, as euerie member is a∣ble to receiue and take: and thus he maketh the whole bodie to be builded vp, and growe together into him. This point of doctrine deliuered vnto vs by Saint Paule, offereth vnto vs manifold lessons for our learning. For first of all, we haue to gather héerehence, that all and e∣uerie of them are out of the Church, how manie soeuer, which submit not themselues vnto Christ, in the true knowledge of Christ, and in faith: and which setting light by loue, are at daggers drawing one with another, so excéeding great is their hatred betwéene themselues. Furthermore, a true and euident description of the Church maie heerehence be taken, that it is An assem∣ble of such as beleeue in the Gospell, who cleaue so close vnto Christ their head, and are so knit and ioined together betweene themselues, according to the measure of euerie ones faith, according to the diuersitie of the giftes of the holie Ghost, & according to the condition of callings, that they all, & euerie of them liue and are lead by one and the selfe same spirit, and that they suc∣cour and maintaine one another in mutuall goodwill, charitie, and loue. Moreouer, this place also sheweth vs the trimme, handsome, and neate order of Christes Church. For, such is the order of the Church, as of the members of one and the same bodie, vnder one and the same head. Againe, this present place teacheth vs, what manner of like-suf∣fering & consent, or agréement, there ought to be among Christians one with another. For, as in one bodie, when one member is pained and suffereth, the rest of the mem∣bers, all and euerie of them, are partakers of that paine, and suffer therewithall: euen so Christians, who are members of the same bodie, ought to be like minded one towards another, that as well in aduersitie, as in pro∣speritie, one should take part with another. To this
serueth the precept of S. Paule,Rom. 12. 15. Gaudete, &c. Reioice with them that reioice, & weepe with them that weepe. Finallie, and lastlie, we must marke, that the Apostle placeth (The edification of the bodie of Christ,) chiefe∣lie in (loue.) For, by (loue) the knowledge of Christ is made fruitfull, and faith effectuall: yea, both of them are made more notable and excellent. For, where (loue) is not, there doubtlesse the knowledge of Christ is but small and slender: as for faith, it is so little, that there is ne∣uer a whit. For, according to the measure of faith, (loue) is more or lesse. Verses. 17. 18. &. 19. 17 This I saie therefore, and testifie in the Lord, that yee henceforth vvalke not as other Gentiles vvalke in the vanitie of their minde, 18 Hauing their cogitation darkened, and beeing straun∣gers from the life of God, tho∣rough the ignorance that is in them, bicause of the hardnesse of their heart. 19 Which being past feeling, haue giuen themsselues vnto wantonnesse, to vvorke all vn∣cleannesse, euen vvith greedi∣nesse. This I saie therefore and te∣stifie in the Lorde, that yee walke no more as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in vanitie of their minde, blinded in their vnderstanding, beeing straungers from the life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, bicause of the hardnes of their hearts, which being past repentance (or sorow) haue giuen them∣selues vnto wantonnesse, to commit all kinde of vnclean∣nesse with greedinesse. THe Apostle, vpon a generall sentence or clause, fra∣meth particular exhortations. First, his admonition is to all, teaching vs from what kinde of manners wée should absteine: to wit, from the maners of the Gentiles: which he confirmeth from contrarie causes: and first, from the beginnings of actions or causes. The beginnings of actions in the vnholie & heathenish Gentiles, he ma∣keth to be of thrée sorts: to wit, The vanitie of their mind, the darknesse or blindnes of their vnderstanding, & the hardnesse of their heart. The (Minde) is that, which the
Philosophers call , to wit, when a man by the light of reason, discerneth, perceiueth, and iudgeth of things honest and dishonest: but the Apostle auouch∣eth that this (Minde) was vaine (Cogitation or vnder∣standing), which in Gréeke is called , is that naturall abilitie, whereby we deuise, determine, remem∣ber, reason, and gather somewhat by and out of those things, which our minde quietlie séeth and perceiueth, without debating or reasoning: but the Apostle saith, that this vnderstanding was darkened or blinded: wher∣by it came to passe, that the Gentiles béeing ignorant of God, became estraunged (From the life of God.) Now (The life of God) in this place is that, wherby God liueth within, in the heart, and vpon the which, all abi∣litie and desire to doe anie good, dependeth. Vnder the word (Heart) the Apostle compriseth all the lusts and appetites, attributing (Hardnesse) vnto them: whereof it commeth, that men are not touched with anie sparkle of the feare of God, but rather runne headlong whether so euer their lewd lustes, & filthie affections car∣rie or driue them. These are the beginnings and cau∣ses of morall actions, or behauiours (touching religion) in the Gentiles, which as yet are not turned vnto God. But that these things maie somewhat the more plain∣lie bée perceiued, we will inlarge and lighten the same by examples. The (Minde) of man séeth that there is a God, and iudgeth that he is to be worshipped: which iudgement, although it be true, yet notwithstanding it is héere accused of vanitie by the Apostle: and good reason whie: euen because it vanisheth to nothing, and by the corruption and naughtinesse of nature is choked and strangled, before the matter commeth to action & practise. For, when the (Vnderstanding) reasoneth out of this beginning, principle, or ground, & yet straieth from the true God, & from the right waie of worshipping him, the (Minde) in deed séeth that there is both a God, and that
he also is to be worshipped, but the (Vnderstanding) in the Babylonians reasoneth that Bel, in the Aegyptians that Apis, & so in other nations other idols are to be wor∣shipped: & that one while by oblations of men, an other while by other rites and ceremonies, the méere deuises of men. And this is that which Saint Paule speaketh of, saieng,Rom. 1. 23 that The Gentiles turned the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and serued the creature, forsaking the Creator. Furthermore, the Apostle addeth the fit fruites of such causes: namelie, (Ignorance of God, estraunging from the life of God, and hardnesse of heart,) which is, sens∣lesse blockishnesse, or numnesse, not suffering them to féele the greatnesse and gréeuousnesse of their sinnes, but to growe past all remorse of conscience or repentance: so that they ceasse vtterlie, and altogether leaue off to bée sorrie for their sinnes. A certaine inclination to all (Wan∣tonnesse,) followeth this senslesse duinesse, or blockish∣nesse: yea rather, a certaine vnbrideled desire to sinne, which the Apostle tearmeth heere by the name of (Wan∣tonnesse.) This gréedie lust bursteth out into all kinde of villanies and abhominable misbehauiours, which are héere noted vnder the word (Vncleanesse,) all which are increased & made more by (Greedinesse,) the vtter aduer∣sarie to contentation or temperance: vntill it throwe a man downe headlong into the bottomlesse gulfe of dam∣nation. For,  is an vnmeasurable lust or de∣sire, which hauing neuer inough, is alwais séeking to haue more. In this place is first to be marked, what a wretch∣ed creature man is, without the grace of regeneration, or new birth, after the fall of our first parents: to wit (Vaine of mind, blind of vnderstanding, & hard in hart:) wherby we may easilie perceiue, what manner of frée will that is, which the Sophisters & Schoolmen haue in such count, & so highlie praise, euen in such as are not regenerate or new borne. If therefore (according to the doctrine of S. Paule)
our intents, our procéedings, and our verie dooings are faultie and sinfull: what sounde thing is remai∣ning? Tell mée that. And although the Apostle doth not take from man his naturall abilities: yet not∣withstanding, hée proueth that they were corrupt, after his fall. Moreouer, we haue héere to marke, that Saint Paule speaketh not of actions naturall, or ciuill, which are ruled & gouerned by the mouing and gesture of the bodie. For in these remaineth some libertie, in such as are not yet regenerate or borne a new: but he speaketh onelie of the actions which concerne Gods worship and seruice: of which actions there are thrée causes. The first is, the word, which instructeth the minde, and frameth the iudg∣ment. The second is, the holie Ghost, which is effectuall in the word, to the inlightening of the minde, and the in∣clination or bending of the will. The third is, the will of man resting in the worde, and giuing place to the ho∣lie Ghost, of whom it is both instructed and moued. Verses. 20. &. 21. 20 But ye haue not so learned Christ: 21 If so be ye haue heard him, and haue bene taught by him, as the truth is in Iesu. But ye haue not so learned Christ, if so bee that yee haue heard of him, and are taught in him, euen as the truth is in Iesus. THe Apostle sheweth the cause whie the Ephesians ought not, (as other hethernish Gentiles doe) to liue in the ignorance of the Gospell of Christ: to wit, bicause they haue learned Christ. For, as a little before, he re∣hearsed the causes of manie fowle sinnes in the Gen∣tiles, which causes are these: namelie, (The vanitie of their minde, the blindnesse of their vnderstanding, and the hardnesse of their heart:) so in this place he setteth flatlie against all these, the knowledge of Christ aloue:
and further auoucheth, that the same is the cause of lea∣ding a godlie and an honest life. This knowledge therefore of Christ ought to bréed in vs an other manner of liuing, than is in the Gentiles, which are not yet (to this daie) turned vnto God, by and through the preaching of the Gospell. For, this effectu∣all & forceable knowledge of Christ, what doth it? For∣sooth, it reformeth the minde, it inlighteneth the vnder∣standing, and if softeneth the heart: to be short, it renew∣eth the whole man by the spirit of God, that now he be∣ginneth to liue (The life of God.) And this is that which the Apostle saith, (As the truth is in Iesus:) that is to saie, the true waie to liue well, set foorth vnto vs in an excellent and notable example. For, in Christ appea∣red no kinde of marke or token of the olde man: be∣cause he bare the verie image of the Father, and béeing full of the holie Ghost, obeied his Father in all things. The word (Truth) therefore doth signifie, not onelie the assent of trueth, but also the action which followeth the assent: by the figure Synecdoche much vsed in He∣brew. This place therefore is diligentlie to be marked, which teacheth, that the knowledge of Christ, or of the Gospell, is but vaine: vnlesse wée haue ioined there∣withall, such manners as are worthie of Christ, and the Gospell. For the knowledge of the Gospell, standeth not vpon a naked contemplation or gazing at things, not in idle disputations, &c: but in the single knowe∣ledge of Christ, in faith, and in harmelessenesse of life: or, as Saint Paule saith else-where, , that is to saie, In knowledge and vnderstan∣ding. Verses. 22. 23. &. 24. 22 That is, that ye cast off, con∣cerning the conuersation in
time past, the olde man, which is corrupt, through the deceiua∣ble lusts, 23 And be renevved in the spi∣rit of your minde. 24 And put on the nevv man, vvhich after God is created in righteousnesse, and true holi∣nesse. That ye should cast off, (or laie from you) after the for∣mer conuersation, the olde man, which is corrupt, tho∣rough the concupiscenses of error: and should be renewed in the spirit of your minde, and put on the new man, which after God is shaped in righteousnesse and holinesse of truth. THe Apostle declareth, in a short rehearsall, but yet full and pithie, what it is, to haue learned Christ trulie, what truth is in Iesus, and what manner of life the life of a Christian ought to bée. Of this rehearsall there are thrée partes: to wit, (To put off the olde man, to be renewed in the spirit, and to put on the new man. The first part therefore, is the putting off of the olde man. The (Olde man) signifieth, not the substance, but the qualitie: namelie, vice and corruption, & all custome of sinning, according to the conuersation of old. This cu∣stome of sinning, S. Paule would haue all Christians to put off, that the rule and gouernement of the spirit might be effectuall and full: of which thing he sheweth the cause (Which is corrupt through the concupiscences of errour,) that is to saie, whome deceiuable lustes do cor∣rupt, whiles they drawe men into corruption and de∣struction. Whosoeuer therefore desireth to escape destruction and vtter vndooing, let him put off the (Olde man). Now the (Olde man) is then said to be put off, when the bo∣die of sinne is weakened and brought vnder, that wée should serue sinne no more. For so the Apostle expoun∣deth his owne words, saieng, Hoc scientes, &c. Knowing this,Rom. 6. 6. that our old man is crucified with him, that the bo∣die of sin might be destroied, that henceforth we should not serue sinne. In this speach of Saint Paule, the word (Crucified) must be considered. For by that is signi∣fied
the efficacie and working of Christs crosse, and this death in vs, to the crucifieng and mortifieng of the (Olde man.)Rom. 6. 12 13. To this serueth the exhortation of the Apostle, Ne¦igitur, &c. Let not sinne therefore reigne in your mor∣tall bodie, that ye should obeie it in the lustes thereof: neither giue you your members as weapons of vnrighte∣ousnesse vnto sinne: but giue your selues vnto God, as they that are aliue from the dead, and giue your mem∣bers as weapons of righteousnesse vnto God.Mat. 10. 38. This agre∣eth also with the saieng of our Sauiour, Si quis vult, &c. If anie man will come after me,Mat. 16. 24 let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse dailie, and let him followe me.Mark. 8. 34. The second part of the rule héere set downe is, (To be rehewed in the spirit of our minde,)Luk. 9. 23. that is to saie,Luk. 14. 27 to haue our minde made so bright and cléere with new light, that the vanitie of our minde, and the blindnesse of our vnderstanding béeing chased awaie, our inwarde man maie taste, sauour, desire, discerne, perceiue, vnderstand, thinke vpon, and reason of those things which are of the spirit.1. Cor. 2. 14. For, seeing The carnall or naturall man, perceiueth not those things that are of Gods spirit, it is behooue∣full that such a renewing of the spirit bée wrought in vs, as thereby we maie be able to submit and bring vnder our selues to the rule of the spirit. The third part of the rule is (To put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse.) Of this part there are thrée members. The first is, to put on the new man by forsaking sinne, and a renewed spirit. The second, the qualitie of the new man: to wit, that he is (Created after God:) that is to saie, after Gods image or likenesse. The third conteineth the things wherin that newnes or likenes of God consisteth: name∣lie, (Righteousnesse and true holinesse,) with the former whereof we serue men, according to the tenour of the second table: and with the latter wée worshippe God purelie and sincerelie. The worde (True) standeth
for a title due vnto holinesse: (after the manner of the Hebrew phrase,) whereby is meant, that not a fai∣ned or counterfaite (Righteousnesse), not an out∣ward (Holinesse) onelie, but a perfect (Righteousnesse) and an (Holinesse) of hart, agréeing with the rule of Gods will, is required. This place of Saint Paule is diligent∣lie to be marked: not onelie, bicause it conteineth brief∣lie, and in a verie trimme definition, the partes of a Chri∣stian life: but also, bicause it setteth foorth a cléere and euident definition of (Gods image) in man. For, heere∣hence we haue to vnderstand, that (The image of God) is a conformitie or agréeablenesse of man with God (In righteousnesse and true holinesse). Héerevpon it came, that our ancients or elders defined Christianitie to be an imitation or following of the diuine nature. Verse. 25. 25 Wherefore cast off lieng, and speake euerie man truth vnto his neighbour, for vvee are members one of an o∣ther. VVherefore casting awaie lies, speake yee the truth, euerie one to his neigh∣bour, bicause wee are mem∣bers one of an other. NOw he gathereth the specialties, which rise of the generalitie, or generall rule, concerning the put∣ting off of the olde man, and the putting on of the new: besides, he rehearseth certaine members of either man, for examples sake. The first specialtie is: following (Truth) & plaine dealing: or singlenesse and of (Lieng) that is, of auoiding all manner of coulourable excu∣ses, and doublenesse. The Apostle gathereth this speci∣altie, in this sort: The olde man must bée put off, and the new man must bée put on, who is created after God in righteousnesse and true holinesse: Ergo (Truth) is to bée followed as a member of the new man. As for (Li∣eng), that must bée cut off, and cast awaie as a member of
the olde man, to the ende we maie liue with our negh∣bours vprightlie, plainlie, and neighbourlie. To this specialtie he addeth another reason drawne from things iointlie knit together: (We are, saith, hée members one of another,) Ergo we ought to succour and make much one of another, in (Truth) and honestie, without all dissembling and deceipt. After this sort al∣so the rest of the specialties following are to bee ordered, all which are continued in discourse, by an Antithesis or opposition, euen to the end of the Chapter. Verses. 26. 27. 26 Be angrie, but sinne not: let not the sunne goe dovvne vpon your vvrath. 27 Neither giue place to the Diuell. Be angrie, and sinne not: let not the sunne set vpon your an∣ger, and giue not place to the Di∣uell (or backbiter.) HE exhorteth vs, that we should not be (Angrie.) But because it happeneth oftentimes, that euen the godlie are moued, when things fall out amisse, and through the weaknesse of their owne nature: it commeth to passe, that they can not be altogether frée from (Anger.) Wherefore, the first thing that he doth, what is it? Euen to set a stint, and to bound in our (Anger.) Secondlie, he giueth vs counsell and aduise. Thirdlie, he addeth a rea∣son of his counsell. The stint of our (Anger) is, that we should not sinne in being (Angrie:) which is done, so of∣ten as we be (Angrie) either through our owne default, or the default of others. But there is a kinde of praise∣worthie (Anger,) which is kindeled either against our owne sinnes, to repent and be sorie for them: or against the sinnes of others, to correct and punish them: and this onelie (Anger) hath an eie to Gods glorie, and kéepeth a certeine stint. But, because it falleth out so, that we can not bridle
our (Anger,) but through our owne follie it will drawe to it some other sin: the Apostle giueth vs counsell, (That we should not let the sunne goe downe vpon our an∣ger or wrath:) that is to saie, that we should not let the sinne of (Anger) rest long in vs: but as it riseth with the sunne, so to let it fall with the sunne. This selfe same meaning hath Pythagoras his posie,Mea∣ning ther by, that our anger must be no more perceiued than the print of a pots foot vvhen the imbers are raked abroad. Ollae vestigium cinere turbato, The print of a pots foote, when the as∣shes be stirred. For if anger continue anie long time, it commeth to passe, that the Diuell will enter into that angrie mans heart, wholie to possesse it: so that by li∣tle and litle he shall be swallowed vp at length in the gulfe of destruction. And this is the sense of that which the Apostle addeth, (Neither giue place to the Diuell.) This place is diligentlie to be considered, which beareth witnesse, that the Diuell hath entraunce and roome made him to dwell in the heart of man, (By anger and wrath.) Séeing it is so, fie vpon it: and if we loue our selues, let vs flie from (Anger and wrath,) as from the nette and snare of Sathan. Verse. 28. 28 Let him that stole, steale no more: but let him rather la∣bour & vvorke vvith his hands the thing vvhich is good, that he maie haue to giue vnto him that needeth. Let him that did steale, steale no more, but labour rather, working that which is good with his hands, that he maie haue to giue vnto him that suffereth neede. VNder the name of (stealth or theft,) the Apostle, by the figure Synecdoche, vnderstandeth all deuises and waies whatsoeuer of deceiuing. And as he giueth coun∣sell to cut off this (Theft,) as a member of the olde man: so he requireth diligent trauell, and earnest labour of euerie man in his vocation and calling, as a member of the new man. He addeth the ende of this precept: namelie, (That euerie one maie haue to giue vnto him
that needeth:) to wit, vnto them which either by sicknesse or olde age being-hindered, are not able to get their li∣uing with their hands. This place is to be marked a∣gainst théeues and pilferers, which liuing idelie, deuoure the fruits of other mens labours. Verses. 29. 30. 29 Let no corrupt communi∣cation proceede out of your mouthes: but that vvhich is good, to the vse of edifieng, that it maie minister grace vn∣to the hearers. 30 And grieue not the holie spirit of God, by vvhom ye are sealed vnto the daie of redemp∣tion. Let no filthy speach come out of your mouthes, but if anie doe, let it be good & edifieng when neede is, that it maie giue grace to the hearers: and grieue ye not the holie spirit of God, by whom ye are sealed vn∣to the daie of redemption. AS he exhorteth vs to cut off filthie speaking and ri∣bauldrie, being one of the nastiest and fowlest mem∣bers of the olde man: so he giueth vs counsell to vse good and honest talke, as necessarie for edification, béeing a member of the new man: that in so doing it might (Mi∣nister grace:) that is to saie, might turne to the profit and commoditie of the hearers. For, vnder this word (Grace) anie kinde of commoditie and profite whatsoeuer is in this place to be vnderstood. Furthermore, to his exhortation he ioineth a substan∣tiall reason, saieng: (And grieue not the holie spirit of God:) to wit, with your filthie talke. Now there is héere to be marked a double figure. The first is called, , whereby the affections and properties of man, are applied vnto God. The second is Metonymia. For, (To grieue the spirit,) is to offend the spirit: yea, in such sort to moue him, that he forsaketh man vtterlie, in whom he tooke vp (as it were) his Inne. For, as a guest béeing thrust out of his Inne by violence,
feeleth himselfe therewith greatlie grieued: euen so the holie spirit is said to be grieued, when he forsaketh the heart of man, wherein he lodged before by faith: séeing manie a fowle sinne harboured in the same. This exhortation of Saint Paule, if it take place a∣mong them, which professe the name of Christians, there would be fewer offenses giuen by their life, and greater quietnesse among men. But lewd custome, mens mali∣ciousnesse, the diuels temptations, and the wickednesse of the flesh, pull on the most part of men (the more pi∣tie) to the contrarie, and that not without great offense to the Church, and the vndoubted destruction of manie. The weapons therefore, wherewith we must fight a∣gainst this auncient lewd custome, against mens malici∣ousnesse, against the diuels temptations, and against the wickednesse of the flesh, are faith and praier. That which the Apostle addeth, (By whom ye are sealed vnto the daie of redemption,) hath excéeding great weight in it to exhort. For the holie spirit is an assured seale, and a certeine marke, whereby the godlie and elect are discer∣ned from the wicked and reprobate, euen till the daie of iudgement and redemption, when we shall be quit and set free from all miseries. Verses. 31. 32. 31 Let all bitternesse, and an∣ger, and vvrath, crieng, and euill speaking be put avvaie from you, vvith all maliciousnesse. 32 Be ye courteous one to ano∣ther, and tender hearted, forgi∣uing one another, euen as God for Christs sake forgaue you. Let all bitternesse, & grudging, & anger, & roaring, & blasphe∣mie, (or cursed speaking) be re∣moued from you, with all malici∣ousnesse (or wickednesse.) And be ye mercifull one to another, for∣giuing one another, euen as God forgaue you in Christ. HE persuaded vs before to cut off anger, as a certeine ill-fauoured and filthie member of the olde man: now he willeth vs to pare awaie quite all the parts
thereof, as ioints of this member: and biddeth vs plant in their places, the vertues which are contrarie to these vices. But because the names of the vices, rehearsed héere, are somewhat like in signification, they are therefore to be discerned and knowne by their difference. (Bitter∣nesse,) which in Greeke is called , is the roote of anger and grudging: this bréedeth grudging or indig∣nation, which in Greeke is called , being a certeine furie or madnesse of the minde thirsting after reuenge∣ment. Indignation or grudging bréedeth wrath, which bursteth out euen to the deede doing. This wrath, is the mother of (Crieng or roaring,) that is to saie, of quarrel∣lous words, tending wholie to contention & strife. (Crieng or roaring) bringeth foth (blasphemie, or cursed & euill speaking,) whereby one doth what he can to nicke ano∣thers name to raise vp an ill report vpon him, & so to séeke his discredite & vndooing. The Apostles minde is, that all these sinnes and (Maliciousnesse) also with them, be vtterlie put awaie: for these be the weapons, where∣with men arme themselues, to wound and hurt their neighbours. Moreouer, the Apostle setteth flat against these mem∣bers of the olde man, the members of the new man: to wit, (Courtesie, mercifulnesse, or tender heartednesse, and forgiuing one another.) And to the ende he might persuade the Ephesians héerein, he bringeth the principall paterne of all paternes: namelie (God the Father, who for Christes sake forgaue vs.) All Christians therefore, as manie as couet like children to boast of so great a Father, it behoueth them to applie themselues to this paterne. For, is it not a filthie thing, that children should not followe the vertues of their Father, so farre as they maie?Luke. 6. 36 Héereto serueth the commandement of Christ, Estote misericordes, sicut & Pater vester coe∣lestis misericors est: Be ye mercifull, as your heauenlie
Father also is mercifull. Saint Ambrose frameth the Apostles argument in this manner: Si Deus per fi∣lium suum seruorum misertus est, quanto magis serui ipsi inuicem sibi debent misereri & donare, sralter in alterum peccet? In English thus: If God for his sonnes sake, had compassion of vs being but seruaunts: how much more ought we being seruaunts, to be pitifull, and forgiue one another, if one offend an∣other.
¶THE FIFT CHAPTER. ¶THE SVMME OF THE fift Chapter. AS God the Father is to be followed in all holinesse and purenesse: euen so is mutuall loue and charitie to be mainteined, after Christs example: to the ende that all filthinesse and vncleannesse being put to flight, we should liue holilie and honestlie. Furthermore, sub∣iects must be godlie disposed among themselues, and liue Christianlie one with another. And, as it becommeth women to be obedient to their owne husbands: euen so on the other side, it is the dutie of husbands to loue their wiues, after the example of Christ, who loueth and ten∣dereth the Church his déere spouse. ¶THE ORDER AND PARTS of the fift Chapter. THe beginning of this fift Chapter, is concluded vpon the last verse of the fourth Chapter. For, as the A∣postle did there take an argument or reason of mutuall goodwill and forgiuing one another, euen from the ex∣ample of our heauenlie Father: euen so héere in the be∣ginning of this fift Chapter, he fetteth downe another ex∣ample of the same Father, generallie to be folowed of all: & he maketh a certeine souereigne or principall ground, of the specialties following. To this example he addeth an exhortation to mutuall loue, taking his reason from the example of Christ: from whence, (I meane from the example of the Father and of Christ,) he is carried a∣gaine to the specialties, compared by setting contraries against contraries: and he reckoneth vp diuers duties of Christians not a fewe, interlacing reasons drawne from the diuersitie of our estate, being of two sorts: namelie, before the light of Christ was knowne, and vnder grace.
Lastlie, he entereth againe into a generall exhortation concerning mutuall submission, or dutifulnesse, which he diuideth streight-waies into more specialties, & han∣deleth two of them at large in this Chapter. The first whereof is touching the submission, which women ought of dutie to shew and perfourme to their husbands. The second concerning the dutie of husbands, that they shuld loue their wiues, euen as Christ loueth his Church. THE EXPOSITION OF THE FIFT Chapter, with the obseruation of the doc∣trines therein conteined. Verses. 1. 2. 1 Be ye therefore follovvers of God, as deere children, 2 And vvalke in loue, euen as Christ hath loued vs, & hath giuen himselfe for vs, to be an offering, and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauour to God. Be ye therefore followers of God, as beloued children, and walke in loue, euen as Christ lo∣ued vs, and gaue himselfe for vs, an oblation and sacrifice of a good sweete sauour vnto God. THe example of God set downe in the end of the fourth Chapter in speciall, I applie in generall: to wit, that in all our actions and doings: yea, in the whole course of our life, we should be (Follow∣ers of God as deere children.) This (Following) consisteth in true holinesse, wherby the spi∣rit is kept pure and perfect, and the soule and bodie with out complaint: that is to saie, it is framed to the rule of Gods will, declared in his Lawe. Hereto serueth the sai∣eng of the Apostle,1. Thess. 5. 23. Ipse Deus pacis, &c. The verie God of peace sanctifie you throughout, that your whole spi∣rit, and soule, and bodie, maie be kept blamelesse, vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. This is the (Following) which God requireth, when he saith,Leu. 11. 44. Sancti estote, &c. Be ye holie, because I the
Lord am holie,Leuit. 19. 2 and haue separated you from other peo∣ple,Leuet. 20. 7. 8. that ye should be holie. After the same manner also Christ setteth before vs the example of his Father to bée followed,1. Pet. 1. 16. saieng, Estote vos perfecti, &c. Be yee perfect, euen as your Father which is in heauen is perfect.Mat. 5. 48 The Lord in this place requireth not an equall perfectnesse, but a like perfectnesse, according to the measure which is in vs, till we are come to true perfectnesse in déed, which is signified by this word (Following.) This place is diligentlie to be marked. For it teach∣eth, that whosoeuer will be in the number of Gods chil∣dren, they must followe the example of their heauenlie Father, in all holinesse and purenesse. They that neg∣lect this, and doe it not, wrongfullie take vnto themselues the name of children, seeing they are rather bastards, than lawfullie begotten. Héerevnto he addeth the example of the Sonne, whereby hée exhorteth vs to loue one an o∣ther. And that this present example might haue the more weight, he sheweth brieflie from the effect, how the loue of the Sonne of God is towards vs: to wit, (Bicause hee hath giuen himselfe to be an offering & a sacrifice vnto God for vs:) that is to saie, a slaine sacrifice, whereby satisfaction was made to God for our sinnes, (Hauing a sweet smelling sauour,) that is, with which onelie sacri∣fice God was delighted and well pleased. Now there is to be marked in this place a double figure. First, . For the Apostle in this place (after the ex∣ample of Moses) putteth vpon God the person of a man, that he might frame himselfe to our capacitie & know∣ledge.Gen. 8. 21. For thus speaketh Moses, Oderatus est odorem suauitatis, The Lord smelt a sauour of sweetnesse. Se∣condlie, Metalepsis, a figure in great vse with the Hebri∣cians. For, by the swéete smelling sauour is vnderstoode, a sacrifice acceptable & pleasing vnto God. The Author of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, vsing a proper speach,
whereby he expounding the phrase of Moses, saith: Tali∣bus hostijs,Heb. 13. 16 &c. With such sacrifices , God is onelie delighted or well pleased. This Argument of Christs loue towards vs, contei∣neth in it thrée things. The first is, that the death of Christ is the onelie price of our redemption. The second, that God performed all these things, vnderserued on our part, of his méere goodnesse and loue. The third, that the think∣ing vpon this excéeding great loue of Christ, ought right∣well to put vs in minde of louing one an other. Where∣fore, if we will be partakers of Christ, let vs endeuour our selues to loue one an other: speciallie, séeing he him∣selfe said thus, In hoc cognoscent homines, &c. By shall all men knowe that ye are my disciples,Iohn. 13. 35 if ye haue loue one to an other, as I haue loued you. Verse. 3. 3 But fornication, and all vn∣cleannesse, or couetousnesse, let it not bee once named a∣mong you, as it becommeth Saints. But as for fornication, and all vncleannesse, or couetousnesse, let it not be once named a∣mong you, as it becommeth Saints. THe Apostle beginneth to reckon vp such sinnes as fight with the true following of God our heauenlie Father, to wit, with holinesse, which God will haue to be the beautie and ornament of his children: and he set∣teth downe thrée: namelie, (Fornication,) that is to saie, a wandering fleshlie lust: (Vncleannesse) that is to saie, all kinde of concupiscence, wherewith the soule and the bodie is defiled: (And couetousnesse,) which quencheth and putteth out quite all hope & trust in God, and nou∣risheth vp a wicked confidence in monie, as in an idole. The Apostles minde and will is, to haue these vices so wéeded vp, that they should not be once named among Christians, much lesse vsed. S. Paule seemeth to haue had
ancie vnto that place in Deuteronomie,Deut. 23. 27, where it is said, Non sit meretrix, &c. There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a whoore-kee∣per of the sonnes of Israel. But (alas) the wounds of the Church are iustlie to be lamented. For these most filthie & noisome plagues, are not onelie wantonlie named, but also lawleslie com∣mitted: yea, euen of such as brag and boast, that they execute the iudgement of God. But it is the duetie of the godlie to take héede, least with the multitude of sin∣ners, and their horrible offenses, they fall into Sathans net, and so either to blaspheme and slaunder the word of God, through the lewde behauiours and beastlie maners of such, as will be counted iollie fellowes in the Church of God: or else to be allured by example to folowe their filthie fashions, which is done too soone (God wot) where no héed is taken. For men do much sooner followe the vice of one, than the vertue of manie. Now, the reason whie S. Paule would not haue these vices named, stan∣deth vpon disagréements. Christians must be holie, Ergo they shall not meddle with any thing that is beastlie and abhominable. Verse. 4. 4 Neither filthinesse, neither foolish talking, neither ieast∣ing, which are things not com∣lie: but rather giuing of thanks. And filthinesse, and foolish tal∣king, and ribauldrie, (or beast∣lie and vnhonest ieasting) which become not: but rather thankesgi∣uing. YEt againe the Apostle ioineth thrée vices together, which doe likewise fall at defiaunce and open fight with the following of God, & true holinesse: against which thrée vices, he setteth the vertue  (Thankes∣giuing:) a vertue in déed, which doth not onelie signifie a praier wherein we giue God glorie, thanks, & praise: but also language or speach seasoned with comlinesse & swéet∣nes. For God loueth not that Stoicall sowrenes., & glum∣mie countenance whereby men are made afraid to be con∣sant
with vs: but as his will is to haue vs gentle and swéet in our life and conuersation one towardes an o∣ther, so he requireth communication seasoned with god∣lie swéetnesse. Furthermore, where the Apostle interlaceth this, (Which are things not comelie:) it is an argument drawne from disagréements. For all manner of filthi∣nesse, ribauldrie, and dishonest ieasting, either in behaui∣our, or in talke, is vtterlie at daggers drawing with the dutie of a Christian. Verse. 5. 5 For this ye knovve, that no vvhooremonger, neither vn∣cleane person, nor couetous person, vvhich is an idolater, hath anie inheritaunce in the kingdome of Christ, and of God. For this you knowe, that no whooremonger, or vncleane, or couetous person, or which is an image worshipper, (or idolater) shall obtaine anie inheritaunce in the kingdome of Christ, and of God. THe Apostle addeth vnto the wordes going before, a verie heauie threatening: or a reason drawne from the punishment which hangeth ouer the heades of (Whooremongers, vncleane and couetous persons:) to wit, that they are shut out from the inheritance of Christ and of God. And no meruell: for (wot you what) a iusti∣fieng faith can by no meanes stand or agrée with these plagues. Neuerthelesse, hope of pardon and forgiuenesse is not denied or withheld from the offender, by this threa∣tening: but the punishment due by desert to such fowle sinnes is onelie signified, that the filthinesse of sinne, bée∣ing once knowne, and the greatnesse of our guiltinesse therein vnderstoode by the punishments, we might fall to repentance, and defie all such filthinesse. For the rule of the Prophet, concerning the repen∣tant, as it is alwaies, so is it now to be laid fast hold vp∣pon:Ezech. 14. 15. Cùm recesserit, &c. When the wicked shall turne
from his sinne, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surelie liue,Ezech. 33. 11. and not die. Againe, Nolo mortem, &c. I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his waie, and liue. But speciall héede must be taken, that we abuse not this rule to the disho∣nour of God, and our owne destruction. Let vs therfore beware, that we runne not with full raine into a lewde custome of sinning, least God giue vs ouer into a repro∣bate minde, and wée become carelesse of our wick∣ed déedes, minding nothing lesse than to bee sorrie for them. For, if we set at naught the outcries of the holie Ghost, ringing in our eares by the preaching of the Gospell, & calling vs to repentance: it is to be feared, that we shall be quite cast awaie by Gods iust iudgement, and counted dead creatures, and damned soules, ordeined to eternall torments, before God. Which punishment doubtlesse is most worthie, that God therewith should take vengeance vpon the malapert vntowardnesse, sawcinesse, and pée∣uishnesse of men. Verses. 6. &. 7. 6 Let no man deceiue you vvith vaine words: for, for such things commeth the vvrath of God vpon the children of dis∣obedience. 7 Be not therefore compani∣ons vvith them. Let no man deceiue you with vaine speches. For by such things commeth the wrath of God, vp∣on the children of disobedi∣ence. Bee yee not therefore made partakers with them. IN these words the Apostle vseth the figure Prolep∣sis, which in English maie be called a Presumption, whereby he catcheth their obiection & excuse by the head, which diminish and lessen the sinnes aboue rehearsed, saieng, that they are but escapes and defaults following mans frailtie & weaknesse: and that God is not so cruell a tyrant, that for such offenses he will quite cast men a∣waie:
Moreouer, that there were diuerse: yea, euen of the most holie Fathers, in all ages and times, which fell in the like: againe, that grace so aboundeth, as it swal∣loweth vp the sinnes of the whole world: and finallie, that it is inough, if a man be brought to the repentaunce of his sinnes committed, when he is going out of this world, and giuing vp the ghost. With these and such like reasons, manie doe misera∣blie deserue themselues, vntill they tumble downe head∣long into euerlasting destruction. But yet our Apostle doth admonish the godlie in this place, that they suffer not themselues to be deceiued, insnared, and tangled with (Vaine words), whereby as with a hooke Sathan draw∣eth them into hell. There is no poison more dangerous, than are those excuses & delaies, which kéepe, embolden, & harden vs in our sinnes. For, whosoeuer listeneth vnto such (Vaine words,) & is in liking with them, saie what ye will, he is vtterlie voide of the feare of God. For, this is proper to the feare of God, (as the sonne of Syrach saith,) euen to driue out and chase awaie sinne. I saie therefore, that we must flee from the spéeches of such heathenish & vnholie men, not as from the swéete and entising songs of Syrens, but as from the deadlie stings and wounds of Sathan. For, these men turne the iudgement of God, and the rebuking of sinnes, into toies and merriments. Let vs rather be moued with the exam∣ples of the whole world, which for such sinnes sake, felt the heauie wrath of God, that is to saie, the vengeance of God falling vpon (The children of disobedience:) that is to saie, vpon stubburne and wilfull men. The floud is a witnesse héereof, the burning vp of So∣dom maketh it a cléere case, verie manie ouerthrows, and horrible changes of diuerse kingdomes, Commonwelths, and honourable houses auouch it for a truth. And that it is no lie, the torments of the wicked, wherwith God will punish their stifneckednesse and neglect of dutie, shall bée
a sufficent triall. Let vs therfore obeie the holie spirit, ex∣horting & commanding vs (That we should not be com∣panions with them:) & let vs earnestlie & in time fall to repentance of our former life, least the Lord in his furie most iustlie cast vs off, and giue vs ouer into a reprobate minde, till we growe past grace & be vtterlie void of anie féeling of sorowe for our sinnes. Let not the multitude of misliuing sinners moue vs, let not lawlesnes be a cloke to couer our shame, let not scaping scot frée, when we haue done amisse, deceiue vs. The punishment is not forgiuen or forgotten, though for a time it be forborne and driuen off. Let vs not therefore set light by Gods gentlenesse, and long suffering, dailie calling vs to amendement. Verse. 8. 8 For ye vvere once darknesse, but are novv light in the Lord: walke as children of light. For ye were sometimes darknesse, but are now light in the Lord, as children of light so walke. HE fetcheth the reason of hisexh ortation, from a com∣parison of the Ephesians double estate: to wit, of that wherein they were before their conuersion: and of this wherein they are now placed after their conuersion. For it is méete, that euerie one should answere in life & man∣ners, the degrée and place wherein he is set: and should also take héed that he staine not his estate with anie spot, least through his owne follie and fault, he fall from that dignitie, whereto he was aduaunced, both to his owne shame and reproch, and also to the ruine and decaie of o∣thers, which by their example are the worse. The Apostle in this place calleth men that are blin∣ded in their sinnes, & liue altogether disorderedlie & villa∣nouslie, by the tearme of (Darknesse:) such are all they, (manie, or few,) which are not yet conuerted or tur∣ned by the Gospell. Now, this figure Metonymi, hath in it great force, as when we call a wicked man, wickednesse it selfe. The meaning therefore is this. Before your conuersion, (O yée Ephesians,)
what were ye? Euen men made of the méere darknesse of ignorance and maliciousnesse: so that there was not one mite of true and healthfull light remaining in you. But now you are light, walke therefore as children of light. The word (Light) is attributed and giuen to the faithfull: both bicause they are inlightened in themselues with true light: and also, bicause they giue more light, and shine brighter than others: insomuch that they doe e∣uen reproue and finde fault with the life of the wicked: that is to saie, make the same more manifest. This place is principallie to be marked, which admo∣nisheth vs, that the thinking vpon the dignitie and wor∣thinesse of Christians, ought to be a pricke vnto them, to stirre them vp to liue holilie and vnblameablie: both that we should performe to God ward all due obedience, and also drawe others forward by our example to godli∣nesse. Besides that, this place teacheth vs, that such as professe themselues to be Christians, and yet liue wicked∣lie, deceiue themselues, and laie themselues wide open to greater danger of damnation. For they are not the (Chil∣dren of light), that is to saie, they are not inlightened with the true light, vnlesse they defie and forsake the workes of darknesse. Verse. 9. (For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodnesse, and righteous∣nesse, and truth.) For the fruit of the spirit is in all goodnesse, righteousnesse, & truth. THis Argument is drawne from the cause efficient. We which beléeue, are regenerate or new borne, and indued with the spirit of Christ. Now, (The fruit of the spirit, is goodnesse, righteousnesse, and truth.) Therfore we must doe what we can, by these, to stand against ma∣liciousnesse, vnrighteousnesse, & lieng. This verse must be read in a Parenthesis, that the words which folowe, maie
agrée with the sentence going before. Verses. 10. 11. 10 Approuing that vvhich is pleasing to the Lord. 11 And haue no fellowship vvith the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, but euen reproue them rather. Allowing that whereby the Lord is well pleased, and haue nothing to doe (or meddle not) with vnfruitfull (or vnprofita∣ble) workes, but rather rebuke them. THe Apostle declareth, what it is (To walke as chil∣dren of light,) and he draweth the endeuours or stu∣dies of the children of light, as it were to thrée heads. For his will is first, that we should search out and ap∣proue whatsoeuer is acceptable vnto God: that is to saie, whatsoeuer is commanded and set downe in his word. For, as the word of God alone instructeth and teacheth vs, what pleaseth him, and what displeaseth him: so this word alone ought to be the rule of life vnto the godlie. Secondlie, the Apostle requireth vs (Not to haue anie fellowship with the vnfruitfull) that is to saie, vn∣profitable & hurtfull (works of darknesse:) to wit, which procéed from the ignorance of the Gospell, & of Christ, and which haue in them as their cause, concupiscence in∣gendered: such are the heathenish and horrible sinnes, wherewith they that are ignoraunt of the Gospell, de∣file and staine themselues▪ Now, we are said then to haue fellowship with heinous and great disordered sinnes, both when we either make proofe anie manner of waie, one or other, that they please vs, or when we ouerslip them with silence, and that most of all, if our calling otherwise séeme to charge vs, that we ought openlie to professe our selues displeased with them. Thirdlie, that we should rebuke the workes of dark∣nesse, and that as well by our holie and honest life, as al∣so
by liuelie voice, springing from a certeine zeale of the glorie of God: and thus must we chieflie doe, if it stand with the order of our vocation and calling. But, if we maie not doe it in words: yet notwithstanding, wée must shewe one waie or other, that these sinnes and offenses like vs not in anie case, but altogether irke and loath vs. This place is to be marked. For the Apostle doeth not comprise in a short Aphorisme, the duties of the chil∣dren of light: to wit, of Christians onelie: but also dis∣proueth and throweth vnder foote the vanitie of them, that giue a gesse, (as the blinde man shootes his bolt,) that they doe their duties to the vttermost, if they sinne not themselues in their owne person, being neuer a whit carefull for others. Moreouer, the Apostle teacheth in this place, that they also are out of the waie, and twang vpon a wrong string, who though they liue in blind Po∣perie, thinke notwithstanding that it is enough to ab∣horre vngodlinesse, and defie papisticall superstition in minde and thought, supposing that to be present at the abhominable,Because that in beeing buisie therea∣bouts, they pil∣fer and steale frō God, part of his ho∣nour and seruice. théeuish, and heathenish deuotions of Pa∣pists, for outward peace and quietnesse sake, is nothing hurtfull. For they, which either by their presence séeme to allowe these trumperies, although in minde they mislike them much: yet notwithstanding, they put the halter of wicked fellowshippe about their owne neckes. And what doe they? They vnderstand not, that it makes no matter, whether they doe it of blinde super∣stition, or of craftie and close dissimulation: seeing that by either euill, as well this,  that, men make a mocke of Gods holie religion, and by their example, partlie con∣firme and embolden the ignoraunce of the blunter sort in more obstinate stubbornesse: and partlie inféeble and shake the doubtfull and wauering consciences of weak∣lings.2. Reg. 5. 18. As for Naaman the Gouernour of Syria, hée
makes verie litle or nothing on their side, who at such time as he asked God forgiuenesse of one thing: to wit, if he entered into the temple of Rimmon with his Lord and King, and worshipped there: the Prophet let him goe in peace. For that worshipping was not a falling downe before idols: but a certeine stooping and ben∣ding forward of his bodie, that the King might the more eastlie leane vpon him, as he staied and bare him vp. That this is so, the historie it selfe plainlie proueth. Verses. 12. 13. 14. 12 For it is shame, euen to speake of the things which are done of them in secret. 13 But all things, vvhen they are reproued of the light, are manifest: for it is light that maketh all things manifest. 14 Wherefore he saith, A∣vvake thou that sleepest, and stand vp from the dead, and Christ shall giue thee light. For it is filthie to tell what things are done priuilie of thē: but all things, whiles they are rebuked of the light, are made manifest. For whatsoeuer ma∣keth manifest, the same is light. VVherefore he saith, A∣rise thou that sleepest, & stand vp from the dead, and Christ shall giue thee light. THe Apostle maketh the sinnes and offenses of the heathenish Gentiles the more grieuous, and shew∣eth therewithall the fruite of rebuking and reprouing: whereby the godlie, through their honest and holie life, may rebuke the vncleannesse and wickednesse of the vn∣godlie. For, by such kindes of rebuking, wicked men come to the knowledge of themselues: and when they take a view of the manners of the godlie, they confesse their owne beastlinesse: and so at length beginne to bée ashamed of the filthinesse of their faultes and vices. This is the meaning of this part or parcell of doc∣trine.
But, because the words of the Apostle haue neede to be erpounded, we will saie somewhat, that the weight of his words maie be marked. For first of all, when he saith, (It is shame euen to speake of the things which are done of them in secret,) it is a making of the mat∣ter worse, by laieng two euill things together. It is lesse to speake of offenses and faults, than to commit or doe them: now, if so be it is shame, euen to speake or talke of such misdéeds as they haue done, trulie then the doing of a filthie déede is most of all to be defied and spet at. Anon after, when he saith, (All things, when they are reproued of the light, are manifest,) he declareth the fruite of brotherlie rebuking or chiding one another. The sense or meaning of the words is this, as Saint Ambrose doth expound them, Then doe wicked men and offenders appeare, and are seene in their colours, when they are taken vp for their faults: because he which offendeth, so long as he is not rebuked, hee see∣meth in his owne eies not to offend at all. Now they are made manifest by the light, because the children of God, who are called, The children of light, rebuke them by their life, their doctrine, & wholsom admonishments. The proofe of this speach followeth, euen frō the nature of light. (Light, saith the Apostle, maketh all things manifest.) For, as darknesse shadoweth and couereth all things, and maketh them secreat and hidden: so the light bringeth that out into open sight, and bright noone tide, which laie lurking and shroonke vp in darknesse. To this also he addeth another comparison drawne from authoritie of Scripture: (Awake, saith he, thou that sleepest:) that is to saie, thou that snortest in thy sinnes, forsake thy sinnes, and (Arise from the dead:) that is to saie, absteine from sinnes which bring death with them. (And Christ shall giue thee light:) that is to saie, thou shalt féele consolation by the spirit of Christ. For how much more we slie from the darknesse of
sinnes, so much more shall Christ the sunne of righteous∣nesse shine in our hearts. Saint Hierome denieth that this saieng is anie where to be found in the Scriptures. Some there be, which thinke that the Apostle had an eie to that place of the Prophet, where it is spoken thus, Surge, illuminare, &c. Arise, be bright: for thy light is come,Esai. 60. 1 and the glorie of the Lord is risen vpon thee. Other some referre it vnto an other place, because it should not seeme to be vnwarranted, where it is said thus, Populus qui ambulat, &c. The people that wal∣ked in darknesse haue seene a great light:Esai. 9. 2. they that dwelled in the land of the shadowe of death, vpon them hath the light shined. Other some suppose that it is spoken , by waie of imitation. For, all the Prophets and sincere preachers of Gods word, whiles they doe their ende∣uour to call men backe from sinne, doe vse these or such like words in effect. For, first of all, they exhort men (as indéede it is meete) to repentaunce and amendement. Secondlie, they ioine therevnto the word of promise, and consolation also, whereby the repentaunt are rai∣sed vp and comforted. To conclude therefore, let vs all learne, that the spirit of Christ speaketh vnto euerie one of vs, and saith: (Surge qui dormis, &c. Awake thou that sleepest, and stand vp from the dead, and Christ shall giue thee light.) Verses. 15. 16. & 17. 15 Take heede therefore that ye vvalke circumspectlie, not as fooles, but as vvise, 16 Redeeming the time, for the daies are euill. 17 Wherefore be ye not vn∣vvise, but vnderstaud vvhat the vvill of the Lord is. See therefore that ye walke warilie, not as vnwise, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the daies are euill. VVherefore, be ye not vn∣wise, but vnderstand what the Lords will is.
THat which the Apostle spake metaphoricallie before, vnder the names of light and darknesse, now hee ex∣presseth in proper and familiar speach. (Take heede therefore, saith he, that ye walke circumspectlie, not as fooles:) that is to saie, ignoraunt of Christ and of the Gospell: (But as wise:) that is to saie, taught the trueth of God, and knowing the will of God. He addeth a rea∣son of his exhortation drawne from the circumstance of the time: (Redeeming the time, saith he, sor the daies are euill.) Now, what (Redeeming the time) doth meane, we shall soone vnderstand by laieng the contraries together. To let the time passe, by hauing some vaine matter in hand: and, To redéeme the time, are contra∣ries. As that therefore, is the tricke of a negligent and loose fellowe: so is this the point of a thriftie and wise man, who doth not onelie, not abuse time, but also redée∣meth the same, with a thousand honest recreations. The Metaphore is borrowed of merchants or occu∣piers, who are verie buisie about their mart, and make more accompt of some small gaine, than they doe of all fond delights▪ and then chiefelie, when the times bée troublesome, and the daies daungerous: as when hun∣ger, or scarsitie increaseth, or when they haue to deale with craftie yonkers, or when their ware is dead, and séemeth to lie vpon their hands at hap hazard, or other∣wise to hang vpon doubtfull fortune. For then mer∣chants and occupiers buisilie bestirre them, and doe all things circumspectlie, watching (I warrant you) for op∣portunitie in their affaires. Séeing therfore we are said to redéeme the time, when wée prouide against the losse of such things as we loue in this world: let vs (for shame) take the true opportuni∣tie, and fit time of saluation, offered vnto vs by the Gos∣pell. For that shalbe the price of our redemption, if wée renounce all entisements and impediments, which maie withdrawe and kéepe vs backe from the kingdome of
Christ: and by all manner of meanes waite and watch with broad waking eies for the occasion, or due time of repairing our saluation. And why? Euen because the daies are euill. He saith that (The daies are euill,) not in respect of the spaces of houres, and course of the sunne: but in consideration of the corrupt manners of the world. For the figure Metonya is heere vnderstood, whereby time is taken for the thing done in time. By these words he bringeth in that which he set downe before in other words, and saith: (Wherefore be ye not vnwise, but vnderstand what the will of the Lord is:) as if the Apostle should saie, Forsomuch as so great daungers doe incompasse the godlie round about on all sides, it is behouefull, that ye take diligent heede of the malicious∣nesse, and corrupt manners of the world, least ye suffer your selues through foolishnesse to be withdrawne from the right waie: but ye must rather regard this, that the will of God be alwaies before your eies, and in your minde, which ought to be the continuall rule of your race, throughout your whole life, and in all your dooings. The Apostle declareth by an An∣tithesis, or opposition, whome hée calleth (Vnwise.) For hee setteth flatte against them, (Such as vnder∣stand what the will of God is.) They therefore, by proofe of this place, shalbe (Vnwise,) which liue care∣lesselie, litle thinking vpon framing and ordering their life according to the will of God. Furthermore, this place of Saint Paule is worthie to bée alwaies in our sight. For it giueth vs warning, that wée should not suffer our selues to bée throwne headlong into all sorts of sinnes, af∣ter the example of the multitude: from which sinnes, wée must altogether and vtterlie abstaine, if wee will bée godlie indeede: and wee must endeuour our selues to doe the will of God, albeit we renounce and
forsake euerie thing that pleaseth the flesh. Héere let each one of vs eramine and proue himselfe, taking héede therewithall, that we cast not at our tailes too sawcilie and scornfullie, this wholsome exhortation of the holie Ghost, making much of the alluring pleasures of the flesh, and other things, which are of force to turne our hearts from the desire of true godlinesse. Verses. 18. 19. & 20. 18 And be not dronke with wine, vvherein is excesse, but be fulfilled vvith the spirit, 19. Speaking vnto your selues in psalmes, & hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing and making melodie to the Lord in your hearts, 20 Giuing thankes alvvaies for all things vnto God, euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ. And be ye not dronken with wine, wherein is lewdnesse (or wantonnesse) but be ye rather filled with the spirit, speaking vnto your selues in psalmes, & hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing and making melodie in your heart to the Lord, gi∣uing thankes alwaies for all things, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ. THe Apostle (for example sake,) ioineth vnto his ge∣nerall exhortation, certeine specialties: and he com∣mendeth vnto vs in the first place spirituall reioicing, persuading vs from fleshlie reioicing or carnall glad∣nesse. For, as spirituall reioicing as a certeine spirituall wisedome: so fleshlie or carnall reioicing, which is dron∣kennesse, is a kinde of foolishnesse. As therefore he gi∣ueth vs counsell to leaue this: so his aduse is, to take the other: the argument, which he vseth in this case, is drawne from the effect of either of both, and that by , demonstration. For, there is a reason framed orderlie against either of both, as in manie like things before hath bene done. (Be not dronke with wine) saith the Apostle: that is to saie, Take not occasion by ouer drinking your selues, to be merie & reioice. Why so?
Bicause therein consisteth sottishnesse: that is to saie, all kinde of wantonnesse, lewdnesse, filthinesse, and in∣temperance. For, dronkennesse causeth a man to runne headlong into all manner of misdemeanour, & to commit much mischiefe, according to these verses, not so olde as true: Quid non ebrietas, &c. What doth not dronkennesse deale with all? To blab our secrets comes from thence: It biddes be bolde: and greeu'd at gall, Inforceth fight where is no fence. Cicero in his second booke De finibus, declareth who they bée, that are called sots, his words are these: Noli mihi, &c. Tell not me, as ye are wont, of such sots as spue at the table, and are faine to be carried awaie from ban∣kets, and hauing surfetted, goe againe afterwards, and cramme themselues full like Capons. This therefore doth not onelie offend God most gréeuouslie, and put out the light of the holie spirit in our heart: but also estran∣geth and bestraughteth the mind, discloseth secrets, kind∣leth lust, weakeneth the bodie, breedeth verie manie disea∣ses of minde and bodie: of which thing the whole world almost is a witnesse. Against this the Apostle setteth (The fulnesse of the spirit,) that is to saie, ioie in the holie spirit, whereby we burst out into godlie speaches, concerning God and hea∣uenlie things, into (Psalmes, hymnes, spirituall songs, & thanksgiuings,) vnto almightie God our bountifull Fa∣ther, who giueth all things abundantlie to his children, for his sonnes sake Iesus Christ our Lord. For, there∣fore he ioineth (God) and (Father) together in this place, not that they are two, but one God: whose great power doubtlesse, is signified by the name of (God:) and his good will noted, vnder the true name of (Father.) Moreouer, the difference betwéene (Psalmes, hymnes, and songs,) is this. They are (Psalmes,) in singing where∣of
Musicians vse some manner of instrument, besides the tongue (Hymnes) consist in praises, sounded either with the tongue alone, or some other waie. (Songs) are vtte∣red with the voice, and belong not onelie to praises▪ but also to othr things, as prophesies, doctrines, erhortations, &c. Now, Saint Paules meaning is, to haue all theie (Spi∣riuall) that is to saie, not idle, foolish, and wanton: but tending wholie to edification. For this word (Spirituall,) put to, ought to be referred vnto the argument and end. As for the words of S. Paule which followe, they are not at squae with these things, (Speaking vnto your selues:) againe, (Singing and making melodie in your hearts:) For the phrase of Scripture, (Speaking to your selues,) is as much as, betweene or among your selues: & (Sing∣ing in your hearts,) as much as, from your heartes. The Apostle cannot awaie with wanton songs, and vaine pi∣pings, twangings, whistlings, and such like, wherewith the conscience is neuer a whit edified: but the con∣science by them is rather troubled, godlie prai∣ers hindered, deuotions slackened, and the heate of ser∣uing God quenched. The songs which he requireth are such onelie, as proceeding from a pure and cleane heart, bring spirituall gladnesse and reioising to godlie Christi∣ans. This place of the Apostle therefore doth teach, in what things the reioisings of the godlie doe consist: to wit, in speaking one to an other of God, and heauenlie mat∣ters, and in godlie songs, whereby our hearts are stirred vp to greater faith and confidence. Furthermore, although dronkennesse is to bée defi∣ed, and fled from, as a most noisome plague or pestilence: yet notwithstanding, honest and sober meetings of Chri∣stians, to make merrie and banket together, are not to be condemned. For, these maie bée certeine prouoke∣ments of godlinesse, and also of mutuall loue: and there∣fore the godlie shall not vtterlie forsweare and forsake
such kindes of feasting: prouided alwaies, that intem∣peraunce and dronkennesse bée kept out a doore. But of this matter looke further in myA booke so intitu∣led. Pastour. Verse. 21. 21 Submitting your selues one to an other in the feare of God. Submit your selues one to an other in the feare of Christ. HEtherto the Apostle hath reasoned of common duties of Christians: taking in hand now to commend vn∣to the Ephesians the sundrie duties of seuerall persons, he setteth downe first of all a generall rule or precept con∣cerning submission one to an other: and therevpon af∣terwards bringeth in certeine degrées and particulari∣ties touching the same matter. Moreouer, in this gene∣ralitie two things are diligentlie to be marked: to wit, the precept, and the rule, or tho reason of the rule. The precept is this, (Submitting your selues one to an o∣ther.) This precept perteineth to all men, of all states and degrées whatsoeuer. For, there is none, but ought of dutie to doe good vnto others, and to serue them in loue and charitie So kings and princes serue their sub∣iects. For, wheresoeuer truth possesseth the minde, there is also present a readie will to shew all kinde of ser∣uice, and obeisance. The rule of submission one to an other, is (The feare of Christ.) This (Feare) is nothing else, but the seruice of faith and submission. This (Feare) taketh awaie quite all arrogancie, whereby men, as it were ouerlooking one an other from aloft, despise each other. This (Feare) bringeth to passe, that wée denieng our selues, forsake all things, which Christ cannot abide to be in his. To bée short, this (Feare) worketh in vs, that we, after Christes example, serue all men, that by our obedience God might be glorified,
and that we might be knit one to an other in all duties of loue and charitie. This rule of submission therefore, ought to be laid vp in store, euen in the secretest place of our hearts. For, whosoeuer doth not followe this rule, in performing Christian duties, he maie traiterouslie v∣surpe and take vpon him, the name of Christ, but as for the rule of the spirit of Christ, and the gratious go∣uernement hereof, he hath malapertlie shaken it off. Verses. 22. 23. &. 24. 22 Wiues, submit your selues vnto your husbandes, as vnto the Lord: 23 For the husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is the head of the Church, & the same is the sauiour of his bo∣die. 24 Therefore, as the Church is in subiection to Christ, euen so let the vviues be to their hus∣bands in euerie thing. VViues be yee subiect to your owne husbandes, as to the Lord, because the husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is the head of the Church, & he is the sauiour of the bodie. But as the Church is subiect vnto Christ, euen so let wiues be to their owne husbands, in all thinges. THE Apostle laid before vs a generall doctrine of sub∣mission one to an other: now he taketh examples from domesticall or housholde estate, and sheweth in or∣der the mutuall dueties of wiues and husbandes, of chil∣dren and parents, of seruants and Maisters: and he han∣dleth in the first place, the duties of wiues towards their husbands. He confirmeth his proposition by compari∣son, and sheweth the manner of subiection or submis∣sion. The proposition standeth vpon comparison, in this sort:Gen. 3. 16. (Wiues submit your selues vnto your husbands, as vnto the Lord.) This lawe of obedience is laid vpon the woman, because she suffered hir selfe to be deceiued of the serpent. And although in the first state of man, the
wife was made subiect to the husband: yet notwith∣standing, that subiection differed from the other, which was afterwards laid vpon the woman. For the first sub∣iection was, as it were frée and not hard a whit: but the second subiection brought with it a heauie yoke, which kept hir vnder, and this was the punishment of hir sinne. But this yoke is made pleasant, rather than gréeuous, to godlie women, when they looke vpon the Lords will, for whose sake they owe subiection to their husbands. The Apostle addeth a reason to his proposition, which reason riseth from the ordinance of God, and from that which is profitable. (Because the husband is the wiues head,) saith Saint Paule: that is to saie, not onelie the higher, as the head in the bodie: but also, as the head gi∣ueth power & ablenesse to the bodie, whereby the health of the bodie is mainteined: so the husband ought to haue a regard to the welfare of his wife. That this was the meaning of S. Paule, by this word (Head,) the compari∣son following doth declare. (As Christ is the head of the Church, and the same is the sauiour of his bodie.) Now, Christ is the (Head) of the Church, both because he alone is chiefe gouernour thereof, and also bicause that whatso∣soeuer good thing the Church hath, it procéedeth from Christ hir (Head:) as we haue declared in the second Chapter. Now followeth the manner of subiection. (Therefore as the Church is in subiection to Christ, euen so let the wiues be to their husbands, in euerie thing.) This (Sub∣iection) therfore ought to be frée, voluntarie, willing, rea∣die, chéerefull, pleasant, dutifull, chast, honest, godlie, and so foorth. And although Christ and the husband, are not e∣quall in authoritie: yet notwithstanding, husbands haue rule ouer their (Wiues), after the example of Christ, and represent a certaine image of the Lorde Christ in his Church.
The first is, that wiues which are disobedient and stubburne against their husbandes, are so farre from béeing obedient vnto Christ, that they intangle and winde themselues in Sathans nettes and snares. The second is, that wiues maie receiue great pro∣fit by godlie obedience and subiection: euen as the bo∣die, which cleaueth vnto the head, borroweth and taketh from thence all his liuelinesse and abi∣litie. The third is, that wiues must be content with their owne husbands, whom they must endeuour, to the vtter∣most of their might, to please, with all godlie dutie, and honest seruice. The fourth is, that the subiection of wiues, is not onelie to be allowed, for domesticall or housholde pro∣fits sake: but also bicause it is a seruice pleasing God, when it issueth and commeth from true faith and loue. The fift is, that the errour of the olde heretikes is héere ouerthrowne, who estéemed and tooke marriage for a prophane and vnholie thing, and after a sort vnwor∣thie for Christians. But the holie Ghost in this place is of a farre contrarie minde, who compareth honest marriage, to the coupling of Christ and his Church. Heere let vs note well that saieng in the Epistle to the Hebrewes,Heb. 13. 4. a saieng deseruing due memorie: Honora∣bile inter omnes, &c, Marriage is honourable among all, and the bed vndefiled: but whooremongers and adul∣terers, God will iudge. Verse. 25. 25 Husbands, loue your wiues, euen as Christ loued the Church, and gaue himselfe for it. Husbandes loue your wiues, euen as Christ loued the Church, and gaue himselfe for the same.
THis is the second example or specialtie of the generaltie alreadie past, and conteineth thrée thinges: to wit, the precept, the cause, or the reason, and the manner of loue. The precept is, (Husbandes, loue your wiues.) The cause or reason is, (Euen as Christ loued the Church.) The manner is ex∣pressed by example, (And gaue himselfe for it.) Héerehence doth appeare the greatnesse of Christes loue. If therefore husbandes will rule ouer their wiues, after the example of Christ: let them then learne and knowe, that they are warned by his ex∣ample, to declare their loue by their déedes, if occasi∣on so require: euen as Christ did, whiles he sought and bought the life and saluation of his Church, with his owne death. Verses. 26. &. 27. 26 That he might sanctifie it, and cleanse it by the vvash∣ing of vvater, through the vvord: 27 That he might make it vn∣to himselfe, a glorious Church, not hauing spot, or wrinkle, or anie such thing: but that it should be holie and vvithout blame. That he might make her ho∣lie, cleansing her with the washing of water, in the word, that he might make her vnto himselfe a glorious Church, not hauing blemish or wrinkle, or anie such thing, but that she should be holie and blamelesse. THE Apostle hauing taken occasion by the example of Christ, louing his Church, and giuing him∣selfe for it, maketh a fitte enteraunce into the commen∣dation of the grace of Christ towardes his Church, ac∣cording to the order of such benefites, as Christ of his méere grace, bestowed vpon his Church. For, first of all, hee loued the Church. Secondlie,
for that loues sake he gaue himselfe for hir. Thirdlie, he sanctified his Church: that is to saie, he seuereth and ta∣keth hir apart to himselfe, and maketh hir holie vnto God, through the forgiuenesse of finnes, and the spirit of regeneration, or new birth. Fourthlie, the Apostle addeth the manner how Christ sanctified his Church, saieng: (Cleansing it by the washing of water throgh the word.) Fiftlie, the end of the sanctification of the Church is set downe: to wit, That the Church might be faire & beau∣tifull, without spot or wrinkle, deckt and garnished with holinesse and vnblameablenesse. But the fourth and the fift degrée, doe néede a larger exposition. For, they conteine diuerse and manifold doc∣trines. When the Apostle therefore saith, (Cleansing it by the washing of water through the word, ) he most liuelie setteth foorth the force of the sacrament of Bap∣tisme. For, if we shall as it were vnfolde and laie open these wordes, we shall sée fiue thinges in Baptisme méete and worthie of marking. The first is, Christ clean∣sing vs.1. Ioh. 3. 8 For, to Christ alone this honour doth agrée and belong, Who appeared to this end, that he might destroie the works of the diuell, and take awaie sinne. Héereto serueth the saieng of S. Iohn: Sanguis Iesu, &c. The bloud of Iesus Christ the sonne of God,Heb. 9. 14. cleanseth vs from all sinne.1. Pet. 1. 18 19. The second is, (The washing of water,) which is the outward signe of grace,1. Ioh. 1. 7. and the seale of our inward cleansing.Reuel. 1. 5. The third is, the truth answering vn∣to the signe, which is to be considered: this is a secret cleansing of our soules, and an inward washing awaie of our sinnes. The fourth is, (The word) that the force and vertue of Baptisme maie be vnderstoode by the worde of promise. The fift is, the analogie or proportion of the signe to the truth: which analogie or proportion is dili∣gentlie to be considered in euerie sacrament. The signe is, The washing of water: the analogie or proportion is, As water cleanseth the bodie without: so the bloude of
Christ washeth awaie the filth of sinne from the soule within. This analogie or proportion the Apostle signifi∣eth vnto vs, under this word (Cleansing.) These things throughlie considered, and rightlie weighed: it is easie to knowe, in what accompt the sa∣craments of the Church ought to be. For, they are signes, seales, & tokens, whereby God offereth his grace: and giueth euidence, that he will indéed perfourme that, which the outward things themselues do represent. For, the truth of the thing vnséene, is alwaies ioined with the sacraments séene: and so is the giuing it selfe, which is throughlie done by the secret working of the holie ghost. Not that the holie Ghost standeth in neede of anie out∣ward helpe, but there is consideration had of our weaknesse. Out of these things it is easie to gather, that a sa∣crament is rightlie defined in the new Testament, to bée a signe séene and fealt, ordeined euen of Christ himselfe, to seale the word of grace and promise, which is to be re∣ceiued by faith. And although the wicked are neither washed with Baptisme, nor nourished by the Lords sup∣per: yet notwithstanding, the sacraments kéepe their force and vertue, in respect of God: because howsoeuer the vnthankfull will none of it, Gods grace is offered vnto them neuerthelesse. Furthermore, the description of the Church, which followeth, doth not belong to outward shewe and fashi∣on, but to the inward cleannesse of the heart. This is rightlie to be vnderstood, because of them which denie that there is a Church, where anie such are assembled, as beare about with them, anie manner of spot, blemish, or staine whatsoeuer. To the boulstering vp of which errour of theirs, they wrest this place of Saint Paule: If (saie they) the Church haue no spot, and no wrinkle: if the Church be holie and without blame:Ephes. 5. 26. 27. then shall not this assemblie, where so manie misliuers are met
together be the Church. This errour is disprooued, by the order of praieng, which the Lord left vs for a paterne. For we are bid∣den to praie thus,Mat. 6. 12. Remitte nobis debita, &c. Forgiue vs our trespasses. And in the Psalme it is said, Pro ini∣quitate, &c.Psal. 32. 5. 6. For the remission of sinnes, euerie holie & godlie one shall praie vnto thee. If therefore all the ho∣lie ones, (commonlie called Saints,) haue néede to praie dailie for the remission of sinnes, they shall not then be altogether frée from euerie spotte. And Saint Iohn saith,1. Iohn. 1. 8. 9. Si dixerimus, &c. If that we saie we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and truth is not in vs. If we acknowledge our sinnes, he is faithfull and iust, to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to cleanse vs from all vn∣righteousnesse. The Apostle doth not therefore meane, that the Church is alreadie cleansed, and void of all blemishes or freckles: but rather, that she groweth vp dailie, and con∣tinuallie profiteth, directing her course wholie thither, whither she will neuer be able to come, whiles this world lasteth. For, so long as the Church abideth in this world, she is stained and spotted two waies. For, first of all, there is no member of hers so pure and perfect, but is attainted with diuers sinnes and vices. All the faithfull therefore,Rom. 7. 16. 17. 18. 19 20. 21. 22. &c. for the time of their tarrieng heere, haue alwaies some vncleannesse, which remaineth in their flesh, as plainlie is proued, by the experience of the Saints, or holie ones. Furthermore, Hypocrites and fowle offenders, who with their filthinesse infect the whole Congregation, are alwaies mingled with the good and godlie in the Church: as Saint Paule manifestlie teacheth, writing to the Co∣rinthians. For, he adorneth and beautifieth the Corin∣thians, with the title of the Church: howbeit, there were among them manie high-minded, manie defiled with things offered vp vnto idols, some that had ill
names for committing incest: verie manie vsed the Lords holie supper vnreuerentlie, not a few which called the rising againe of the dead in doubt: as euidentlie appea∣reth in the Epistles. The Lord also himselfe ouerthrow∣eth this, by the parable of the darnell. Whereto then serueth that statelie and loftie speach of the Apostle, calling the Church of Christ his spouse, (Not hauing spotte or wrinkle, holie, and without blame?) I aunswere: the Church is to bée considered af∣ter two sorts: to wit, in her selfe, and in Christ. As the Church is considered in her selfe, she hath manie spottes doubtlesse, wherewith shée is blemished: which notwithstanding are not imputed and laide to her charge, whiles the spirit hath the vpper hand in her. But as shée is considered in Christ, shée is not one∣lie without spotte, but also excéeding gorgeouslie gar∣nished: to wit, with the righteousnesse of Christ, which shée hath obteined by frée gift. Saint Au∣gustine maketh a difference betwéene the state of the Church in this life, and in the life to come. In this life present, the Church hath her spots. In the life to come she shall be without all spot, pure, holie, and without blame in verie deede. This place of the Apostle teacheth, comforteth, and disprooueth. It teacheth, to what ende wée are washed with holie Baptisme: namelie, that wée should endeuour our selues to bée pure and cleane. It comforteth them which grone vnder the burden of their sinnes, and lament that they are ouerladen with them. For the time will come, when their full cleansing shall bee. To this perteineth the com∣plaint of the Apostle, and his comfort by and by following:Rom. 7. 24. 25. Infoelix homo, quis me eripiet ex hoc corpore morits, &c. O wretched man that I am: who shall deliuer mee from the bodie of this death? I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord.
It disproueth them, which brag and boast of Baptisme, and in the meane time lead an vncleane life, flatlie with∣standing the analogie or proportion of Baptisme, which putteth vs in minde of continuall repentaunce. Héere maie that be alledged, which Siant Paule alledged against the Iewes of his time, Circumcisio quidem prodest,Rom. 2. 25 &c. Circumcision verelie is profitable, if thou doe the Lawe: but if thou be a transgressour of the Lawe, thy circumcision is made vncircumcision. Euen after the same manner we maie procéede against them, which are Christians onelie in name: saieng, Baptismus quidem prodest, &c. Baptisme verelie is profitable, if thou do the lawe of Baptisme, that is to say, if thou kéepe the couenant of Baptisme: but if thou be a transgressour thereof, thy Baptisme doth thée no good. Verse. 28. 28 So ought men to loue their vviues, as their ovvne bodies. So ought men to loue their wiues euen as their owne bodies. THe Apostle yet more manifestlie declareth and shew∣eth the manner of louing our wiues: hauing an eie to the first couple that euer were married, euen Adam and Eue. When Adams wife was brought vnto him, he said: Hoc nunc os de ossibus meis, & caro de carne mea: This now is bone of my bones,Gen. 2. 23. and flesh of my flesh. And therefore of Adams ribbe, the Lord made the wo∣man: that thereby he might represent his Church: and also shew, of what minde husbands and wiues ought to be, either to other in holie matrimonie. For, the husband and the wife are (as it were) one and the selfe same flesh: that is to saie, one and the selfe same bodie. Vpon this ground Saint Paule buildeth this reason: (No man e∣uer yet hated his owne flesh:) but the wife is one flesh, or one bodie, with her husband: Ergo, husbands ought
to loue their owne wiues, as their owne flesh and bodies. Verses. 28. 29. 30. 31. 28 He that loueth his vvife, loueth himselfe. 29 For no man euer yet hated his ovvne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, euen as the Lord doeth the Church. 30 For we are members of his bodie, of his flesh, and of his bones. 31 For this cause shall a man leaue father and mother, and shall cleaue to his vvife, & they tvvaine shall be one flesh. He that loueth his wife, loueth himselfe. For no man euer yet hath hated his owne flesh, but nourished and cherished the same, euen as the Lord doth the church, because we are members of his bodie, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this things sake, shall a man forsake fa∣ther and mother, and shall sticke by his wife, and these two shall be one flesh. THe Apostle defendeth and proueth that we must loue our wiues, and setteth downe in the first place, two ariomes, principles, or grounds, which are the proposi∣tions of two syllogismes. Afterwards he addeth other two arguments: the first whereof is fetcht from the ex∣ample of Christ, the second from the ordinance of God. These latter arguments are added, to confirme the for∣mer. The first syllogisme is this, being made vpon the first principle: (He that loueth his wife, loueth his owne selfe:) But euerie husband loueth his owne selfe: Er∣go, he ought to loue his wife. The second syllogisme ri∣seth out of the second principle, in this wise: (No man euer yet hated his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cher∣risheth it:) but the wife is the flesh of her owne hus∣band: Ergo, the husband ought not to hate his wife, but rather to nourish and cherrish her. To this he ioineth an argument drawne from example: (Because she is flesh of his flesh, & bone of his bones.) This he proueth and defendeth by authoritie out of Genesis, saieng: (For this cause shall a man leaue his father and his mother,Gen. 2. 24 and shall cleaue to his wife, and they shall bee two in one
flesh. As if he should saie. A man were better forsake his father and his mother, though he be bound vnto them by the lawes of nature: than to leaue his wife, with whom he is one flesh, so long as the substaunce of ma∣trimonie remaineth safe and sound. For if adulterie creepe in betwéene, the guiltie partie is cut off from that vnitie or onenesse of the flesh, which the Lord requireth in honest matrimonie. Now, the husband and the wife are said to be (One flesh,) not in substaunce, but in af∣fection and loue. For, the husband shall loue his wife and cherrish her, euen as his owne flesh: the wife in like case shall loue her husband as her owne flesh. The hus∣band and the wife therefore are one, out of which vnion or onenesse,Matth. 19. 3. 4. 5. 6. &c. Christ maketh his aunswere to the question concerning diuorcements. Verses. 32. 32 This is a great secreat, but I speake concerning Christ, and concerning the Church. This mysterie is great, but I talke as touching Christ, and the Church. THis is an admonition or aduertisement. For, the A∣postle could not sufficientlie vtter in words, what a wonderfull liuelie image of the coupling of Christ and the Church, marriage, is which God ordeined in Para∣dise. And although marriage be an outward thing: yet notwithstanding, the Apostle auoucheth, that it was a certeine figure of Christ the Bridegroome, and of the Church the Bride. For, as the woman was taken out of the side of the man, as he laie a sléepe: euen so the Church groweth vp by the power and vertue of Christs death. And as she forsaking father and mother, cleaueth vnto her owne husbande, and holdeth her selfe content with him alone, like an honest wife: euen so the Church forsaking idolatrous fornication, shall cleaue vnto her onelie Bridegroome Christ Iesus, and shall rather leaue her most swéete and tender parents, than depart from
Christ her husband. Furthermore, as Eue was created and made out of Adams side: that is to saie, out of the middest of his bo∣die: euen so the Church springeth out of the flesh and bones of Christ, which indéed hath a secret signification, and is mysticallie meant. For, there is a certeineThe la∣tine copie hath Ana∣gogia, vvhich cannot stand with the sense of this place, as the lear∣ned doe knovve. , or proportion, of the thing seene, to that which is spirituall, and not séene: wherevpon S. Paule calleth it, (A mysterie or secret:) that is to saie, a sacrament. For marriage leadeth vs after a sort, by the thing seene, to a thinking vpon the inward coupling together of Christ & the Church, which marriage first represented. And this is Saint Paules meaning, when he saith: (But I speake concerning Christ, and concerning the Church:) as if he should saie, The marriage of the man and the wo∣man, was ordeined of God in Paradise, not onelie for the helping one of another, & for the begetting of children: but also, that the same should be a certeine signe of the coupling together of Christ and the Church: so that vnder things séene, a spirituall matter is represented as it were by liuelie image. Wherfore ye definition of (Mysterium, a Mysterie or secret,) in great vse among the Gréekes, maie fitlie be applied héerevnto. For the Gréeke diuines doe make this definition of (Mysterium, a Mysterie) That it is a visible action or déed doing, hauing ioined vn∣to it a certeine spirituall contemplation or meaning. And although this definition doth generallie agrée to the Sa∣craments of the Church of Christ: yet notwithstanding, the reason is farre otherwise of Sacraments, so called , for their excellencie. For, they were onelie ordeined and appointed of Christ, to be certeine ceremo∣nies & tokens of the inuisible grace, which the Gospell offereth: of which sort there are onelie two in the new testament: namelie, Baptisme, and the Lords supper. Moreouer, as the Papists haue wickedlie wrested this place, to proue, that matrimonie is to be reckoned in
the number of the sacraments of the new Testament: so they truu to a weake foundation, which thinke that the Papists are sufficientlie disproued héereby: because (forsooth) the Gréekes write it a mysterie, & not a sacra∣ment: when indéed these two words do as much differ in generall signification, as () and (Candidum,) both which words doe signifie (White.) For, that which the Gréeke Diuines haue called () the Latines call (Sacramentum:) which is all one. Wherefore, as our auncestours thought, that matrimonie was rightlie cal∣led of Paule, a mysterie, or sacrament: so it is not to be doubted, but they harpe vpon a wrong string, which reckon matrimonie for a sacrament of the new Testa∣ment. Because it is neither a proper ceremonie of the new Testament, neither doth it assure sufficientlie of it selfe, the promise of the grace of the Gospell, neither is it a token or badge belonging to the Church alone: but it is a state and degrée of life common to all mankinde. Verse. 33. 33 Therefore, euerie one of you, doe yee so: let euerie one loue his wife, euen as himselfe: and let the vvife see that shee feare her husband. Let euerie one of you therefore loue his wife as his owne selfe, and let the wife feare her hus∣band. LEast anie should thinke, that holie matrimonie is but a bare badge or signe onelie: and that therefore, the words which haue bene alreadie spoken, concerning the comparison of Christ with the Church, to be referred to the marriage of our first parents alone: the Apostle out∣reaching them that thus might suppose, applieth the ex∣ample vnto all generallie: and shutteth vp in a short summe, such things as hée handeled, touching the duties of married couples, one to another. And as hée draweth the duties of the husband towards
the wife, vnto one head or spring of loue: so hée affir∣meth, that the dutie of the wife is, to feare and reue∣rence her husband, as her head. Vnder this word (Feare,) all duties of the wife, to the husband are conteined. The husband, which loueth his wife vnfeinedlie, imbraceth, tendereth, and maketh as much of her, euen from his heart roote, as he doth of his owne ribbe: that is to saie, as S. Paule speaketh héere, as his owne selfe: that is, as his owne flesh. For the Apostle painteth out before vs this manner of loue: therefore he thinketh well of it, he speaketh honestlie of it, his aduise and endeuour is not lacking to further it: fi∣nallie, he bestoweth all duties of courtesie, humanitie, and gentlenesse vpon it: yea, as he would doe to him∣selfe, so doth he vnto it, according to the lawe of God, and the ordinance of nature. The dutie which shall answere on the other side vn∣to this loue, is conteined in this word (Feare,) wherby the reuerend seruice and dutifulnesse is vnderstood, with the which the wife béeing the inferiour or lower, serueth hir husband being the superiour or higher, & sheweth vn∣to him all duties of subiection belonging vnto him. Shée murmureth not against her husband, she swelleth not at him, shee sets not shoulder against him, shée séekes not to be head and ruler ouer the whole house: but perfor∣meth all manner of duties and seruices to her husbande, with a godlie loue, honest affection, and Christian ten∣dernesse. This subiection, when it procéedeth from faith and the feare of God, it is the trimmest ornament, and the fairest furniture that an honest woman can haue. This place therefore teacheth vs, thatThat is, the regi∣ment of the peo∣ple, vvhen all rule li¦eth in their hands, not al∣lovving anie go∣uernour, but them¦selues. Democracie, or séeking to be all alike in rule, is in a manner against nature. For the rule of the husband ouer the wife, in the house, doth shew the forme and order of Aristocracie, or the verie best and vprightest kinde of gouernment that is.
For, it cannot bée, that there should bée continuance of peace, and maintenance of concord, wheresoeuer this , that is to saie, equall swaie, and rule all alike is receiued, which bringeth to passe, that euerie man is for him∣selfe, all to commaund, and none to obeie.
¶THE SIXT CHAPTER. THE SVMME OF THE SIXT Chapter. CHildren and parents, seruaunts and maisters, must discharge such dueties one to an other, as belong to their calling. All must arme themselues with the furni∣ture and weapons of the spirit, to withstand the king∣dome of Sathan. Praie yée for all men, and for mée, whose state that you maie knowe, I send Tychicus vn∣to you. THE ORDER AND PARTES OF the sixt Chapter. AS hée treated of the duties of married folkes, one to an other, in the end of the fift Chapter: so he setteth downe the duties of children and parents, of seruaunts and maisters, in the beginning of this sixt Chapter. Af∣terwards, the Apostle commeth backe to a generall ex∣hortation, aduising the Ephesians to furnish themselues with spirituall armour, against spirituall enimies, of whom he maketh a short description, and laieth out the spirituall armour, péece by péece, as it is to be put on. Moreouer, the Apostle desireth them to praie for him, and certifieth them, that he sent Tychicus vnto them, to com∣fort them. Lastlie, he shutteth vp his Epistle, after his woonted manner, with blessing & welwishing vnto them. ¶THE EXPOSITION OF THE SIXT Chapter, with the obseruations of the doctrines therein conteined. Verse. 1. 1 Children, obeie your parents in the Lord. Children obeie your parents in the Lord.
THis is the third specialtie: to wit, obe∣dience of children towardes their pa∣rents, wherin we méet with two things to be marked. The first is, that vnder this word (Obedience,) the holie scrip∣ture compriseth honour, whereof obedi∣ence is a most assured token: by the figure Synecdoche, commonlie in vse. This honour hangeth vpon two points: namelie, in affection, and in effect. The honour which standeth vpon affection, is true godlinesse to∣wards our parents, true loue, and feruent good-will like∣wise, wherewith we make much of them, and dutiful∣lie behaue our selues towards them, bicause they are our parents. The effect of honour due to our parents is, to be ful∣lie persuaded in minde and conscience, that their estate is in déede a diuine order and degrée appointed by God: & for that cause to bée had in estimation and account. Let children therefore, euen willinglie, stand in awe of their parents, submit themselues vnto them, obeie them in all things that are honest and lawfull, let them shew them∣selues thankfull, gentle, dooing them good in word and in déed, couering the faults of their elders with méeke∣nesse, or at least wise making the best of that which is amisse. The second thing, which I said was to be marked in this place, is: that this obedience ought to be perfor∣med, (In Domino, In the Lord:) which putteth chil∣dren in minde of two verie great things. The first is, To obeie for the Lords sake, or for his commande∣ments sake, and that faithfullie, or in faith. Héereto serueth that saieng of Iesus the sonne of Syrach, Qui timet, &c. He that feareth God, honoureth his parents. The second is, To knowe that a measure of obedience is appointed them: least they should obeie their parents in things which withstand the Lordes will. For, if pa∣rents
shall take in hand anie such thing, let children learne and knowe, that the lawe of their parents after the flesh, laid vpon them in that sort, is quite displaced by the commandement of a higher gouernour, euen their heauenlie Father. If parents therefore inioine and charge their children to doe anie thing, either against religion, or against hone∣stie, or to the hurt of their common countrie: the chil∣dren owe no obedience at all vnto their parents in this case: yea rather, let them set themselues flatlie face to face & fist to fist against them, prouided alwaies, that they passe not beyond the bounds of godlinesse. To this belongeth that notable saieng of Ausonius: Parentibus, &c. Then doth a child obeie his father & his mother, when hee or she doth that of their owne will & accord, which they are rightlie & well commanded to do. With this also a∣gréeth that saieng of our Lord,Mat. 10. 37. Si quis vult, &c. If anie will come to me, & hateth not his father & his mother, he cannot be my disciple.Luk. 14. 26 Our parents therfore are to be loued, but yet our Creator is to be preferred. Heerevpon S. Ambrose saith: Si officium, &c. If dutie is not to be denied, but to be discharged towards our parents: how much more then to the maker, causer, & procurer of our parents: namelie, God, whom thou art bound to praise & thanke for thy parents? And the same S. Ambrose saith: Vt pasendos, &c. As the Scripture commandeth vs to feed and cherish our parents: so it biddeth vs giue them ouer and forsake them, if they shall bee hinderers of a desire and disposition to holinesse and deuotion. The hate therefore which Christ teacheth vs to beare towards our parents, is but a dissembled hate, or a hate in shew: whereby we seeming deafe and hard of hearing, regard not, but lightlie passe by the swéete sugred songs of Syrens: that is to saie, of our parents, dooing what they can, with the balmed baites of this world to vndoe vs, and to drowne vs in the waues of wickednesse: but
we ought not to giue them the hearing, much lesse the do∣ing. This hate therefore is the hate of dissimulation, not of persecution: of auoiding, not of annoieng: of eschew∣ing, not of vndoing: of godlinesse, not of cruelnesse. For, then ought we, as it were to hate them, to passe by them, to kéepe vs from them, when we cannot serue God and them both at once. But surelie, if both could conuenient∣lie be done, then doubtlesse God first of all must haue his honour, & secondlie our parents their dutie and seruice. Verses. 1. 2. &. 3. 1 For this is right. 2 Honour thy father and mo∣ther, (vvhich is the first com∣mandement vvith promise:) 3 That it maie be vvell vvith thee, and that thou maist liue long on earth. For this is right. Honour thy father and thy mother (which is the first commandement in promise:) that it maie goe well with thee, and that thou maist liue long vpon earth. THis is a reason of the exhortation set downe be∣fore: and it standeth vpon thrée pointes: namelie, vpon that which is honest, vpon the cause commanding, and vpon that which is profitable. It is honest and right to giue thanks for good turnes: to our parents special∣lie, which begot and brought vs vp. The cause com∣manding, is the lawe of God, which chargeth chil∣dren to honour their parents. It is profitable so to doe. Whie? Bicause of the happie successe, good lucke, and long life, which followeth therevpon. But héere certeine questions are to be canuassed and sifted out, the first whereof is this: Doth it not often∣times fall out, that godlie and vertuous children die be∣fore their time, and too too soone? How then shall this pro∣mise of long life vpon earth be sure, steddie, and vndoubted, to trust vnto? Doe not vngodlie and vngra∣tious children liue a long time, and sée manie daies? I aunswere.
This must first of all bée considered, that what earth∣lie benefite, or temporall gifte so euer, our most louing and heauenlie Father doth promise vs, the same is to bée receiued vpon this condition: to wit, so farre foorth as it turneth vs to good, and serueth for the saluation of our soule. Wherefore it commeth to passe, and that not seldome, that how much more God loueth his childe, so much the sooner he taketh him out of this life: according to that saieng, Ablatus est iustus, &c. The iust and righteous man is taken awaie before his time, least wic∣kednesse should chaunge his disposition, and malicious∣nesse marre his manners. Now, because it happeneth sometimes, that wicked and vngratious children liue long: the cause thereof is the long suffering and gentlenesse of God, calling them to repentance, which if they set at naught, they laie vp for themselues, treasure against the daie of wrath, that they maie euen then be tormented with euerlasting paines for their stifnecked stubbornenesse. Whie doth the Apostle call this commaundement, (The first with promise,) béeing in déede the fourth in place and order: séeing also the first commaundement hath a promise ioined with it, euen the promise of Gods fauour and mercie? I aunswere: Wée must marke, that in the lawe of God, promise is of two sortes: the one generall, the other speciall or particular. That is a generall promise, which the first commandement hath hanging vpon it, which is in déede a promise of a vni∣uersall or whole obedience to the lawe of God: that is to saie, it doth not properlie belong to the first com∣maundement, but vnto all the commaundements, or to the vniuersall and whole obedience of the lawe. The spe∣ciall or particular promise is that, which particularlie and seuerallie by it selfe is tied to some one commandement: as, long life is promised in the fourth commandement, to be the reward of obedience towards our parents,
Furthermore, the demand touching the necessitie of the end of euerie ones life, appointed by destinie, is aun∣swered out of this place. For these words of the Apostle do manifestlie disproue & ouerthrowe them, which saie, that the terme of life cannot be shortened by sinne & of∣fense: nor yet prolonged by dutie & obedience. Which if it should be true, the holie Ghost would not in anie wise promise happie successe, and long life vnto them, which honour their parents: and it were flat against all rea∣son, if this obedience should doe no good at all, either for the prosperous falling out of things, or for the lengthe∣ning of life. Against this false imagination therefore of the Sto∣ikes, which doth not onelie hurt and rauish manners, but alse quite putteth out and destroieth all exercises of god∣linesse, most sure and stedfast testimonies must be pro∣uided, and learned: of which testimonies there are thrée kindes speciallie, which ouerthrowe this necessitie of the terme or end of our life, which destinie hath made certeine, vndoubted, and vnmoueable, as saie the Sto∣ikes. the Testimonies are these, promises of obedi∣ence, threatenings for stubbornenesse, and examples of both. Testimonies of promises, because they are manie, these few shall serue the turne. It is thus said in Exodus & Deuteronomie, Honora patrem tuum, & matrem tu∣am,Exod. 20. 12. &c. Honour thy father, and thy mother, that thy daies maie be prolonged vpon the land,Deut. 5. 16 which the Lord giueth thee.Prou. 9. 11 Againe, in the Prouerbs: Per me multipli∣cabuntur, &c.Prou. 10. 2. 27. Thy daies shall be multiplied by me, and the yeares of thy life shall be augmented. Againe, Iusti∣cia liberabit, &c. Righteousnesse deliuereth from death. And againe, Timor Domini, &c. The feare of the Lord increaseth the daies. Of these promises there are manie examples.Deut. 9. 13 14. When God threatned that he would destroie the stifnecked peo∣ple,
Moses intreateth for them, and according to promise, the penitent were spared. The destruction & ouerthrowe of the Niniuites was pronounced euen by Gods owne mouth,Ionas. 3. 2. 4. 10. to fall vpon them the fourtith daie after Ionas be∣gan to preach: but yet according to promise, the peni∣tent were spared.2. Sam. 14. 17. 18. 21. 25. Dauid maketh his praier vnto God, and reared vp an altar, that the pestilence might cease: and he obteined his asking.saie. 38. 3. 5. As for Ezechias, what should I speake of him? His repentance got him fiftéene yeares longer life. There are verie manie testimonies of threatenings for stubbornesse, stiffeneckednesse, and disobedience, such as these:Pro. 20. 20 Qui maledicit, &c. He that curseth his father or his mother, his light shall be put out in obscure pla∣ces, or in the middest of darknesse.Pro. 10. 27 Againe, Anni im∣piorum, &c. The yeares of the wicked shalbe dimini∣shed.Psa. 54. 23 Againe in the Psalme, Viri sanguinum, &c. The bloudie and deceiptfull men, shall not liue halfe their daies. In the 20. Chapter of Leuiticus, the Lord threa∣teneth a rooting out of wicked offenders from among their people, which rooting out, can be nothing else, but a shortening and cutting off of their life, for the fowle of∣fenses which they committed. Of these testimonies, there are manie examples. Her the sonne of Iuda,Gen. 38. 7. 9 10. because he was wicked in the sight of the Lord, it is said that the Lord slew him. Againe, O∣nan spilling his séede vpon the ground, least he should raise vp issue vnto his brother, was also slaine of the Lord.Iosua. 7. 1 25. 26. Achan, for the spoile of the excommunicate thing, was commaunded euen by Gods owne mouth, to bée sto∣ned to death. These promises, and threatenings, with their examples, doe plainlie enough disproue and ouer∣throwe the opinion of the Stoikes, touching the end and ternie of life, guided by destinie. With these reasons accordeth the saieng of Iob:Iob. 7. 1. which they wrest to the stablishing of their opinion.Iob. 14. 5 For
Iob speaketh vnder condition, wherevpon it is manifest, nothing can be proued. And although one or other stand in it stoutlie, that by the words of Iob there is a certeine end of life limitted, set and appointed: let him or them knowe, that the saieng of Iob, concerning the ende of life limitted, set, & appointed, is not to be referred vnto causes of destinie, but to the obedience and disobedience of Gods commaundement. Heerevnto also serueth the demaund touching the va∣nitie of Natiuitie-casters, and Fortune-tellers: that is to saie, of them, which by birthstarres: that is, by starres which arise at euerie ones comming into the world, tell folkes fortunes, their good lucke, and their ill lucke. And although it is to be graunted, that all earthlie things, andAl things vnder the moone are so called inferiour bodies, haue a kinde of affinitie or kinred (as it were) with the course of the starres, and so come by their disposition and qualitie: yet notwithstanding, the knowledge and certeintie of euerie mans disposition and manners, their health and sicknesse, what shall chaunce vnto them, and what they shall doe or suffer in their life: besides all that, when, where, and after what sort they shall die: cannot bée concluded there∣vpon. These are in a manner, the things which our Chalde∣ans, Aegyptians, or Astrologers professe themselues skil∣full & cunning to tell, before they come to passe. For, as we denie not vnto that most noble Art, which they name naturall Astrologie, the knowledge of Natures order, and the mouings of heauenlie bodies: euen so we vtter∣lie mislike their superstition, who professing indiciall A∣strologie, (for with this great and glorious title they decke and garnish their superstition,) doe measure and gesse euerie mans fortune by the houre of his birth. For, to speake of euerie mans manners, and of their health or sicknesse, strength or weaknesse, dispositions and com∣plexions, I saie and auouch it, that there can no cer∣teintie
bée concluded by the starres. And although there be some consent & accord of the stars with these inferiour bodies, wherby the properties & estates, which peculiarlie belong to bodies, are framed: and sometimes also perteine to affections in men, which for the most part consist in complexions: yet notwith∣standing, the Natiuitie-casters, and Fortune-tellers, doe farre ouershoote the marke, when they giue iudge∣ment according to the time of birth. For, whiles they confesse, that recourse must be made from the time of bearing, to the time of begetting: what doe they else, but bewraie their owne vanitie? For, it is not possible, that Natiuitie-casters and Fortune-tellers should heare and knowe for certeintie, the verie time of conception or begetting. For, seeing that the time of birth, is not onelie often∣times sooner than it should be: but also (and that not sel∣dome) put off and delaied the longer, through the weak∣nesse of the woman with child, or which lies in labour: how is it possible (I beséech you) to knowe the verie in∣stant of ones begetting? Speciallie, if but in the missing of a verie few minutes of an houre, there is woont to be a verie great inclination and mouing of the heauens and the starres? He therefore that will certeinlie, & vn∣doubtedlie tell before hand, by the time of birth, what shall happen héereafter, he had néede, taking his Astra∣lobe, and holding it in his hand, to stand by, euen at the time of begetting, when the verie deede is a doo∣ing. For, it is no sure trusting of Clockes or Dialls in so weightie a matter. Furthermore, séeing manie are borne at one and the selfe same instant of time, and yet nothing like in na∣ture and manners, what man béeing well in his wits, will beléeue, that the manners of men depend vpon the starres? Besides that, the force of the seede, which brée∣deth the childe, is much greater than the force of the
starres, as touching the framing of manners. For we see manie expresse the nature and manners of their parents, of whose seede they were begotten. As for the spirituall begetting, whereby the manners of the saints are fra∣med, it hath no place héere. For, that begetting depen∣deth not vpon the starres, but vpon the will of God. Now, touching bodilie health, although I iudge that in some part, the starres haue to deale therein: yet not∣withstanding, I flatlie denie, that it can be certeinlie told of Natiuitie-casters, and Fortune-tellers: because of the vncerteintie of begetting. Vpon the selfe same foundation are their flim flam tales builded, which pro∣fesse that they can tell (as right as a rams horne,) what shall chaunce to euerie man in his life: and this (for∣sooth) they will shewe you by the starre, vnder which they were borne. For as the time of begetting is vncerteine, as hath bene alreadie declared: so the causes of chaunces in a mans life, proceed from some other meanes & place. The saieng of the Lord remaineth fast and sure, Hono∣ra parentes,Exo. 20. 12 vt benè tibi sit, Honour thy parents, that it maie goe well with thee.Deu. 5. 16. This oracle is as certeine, as what is most certeine, which no decrée of Natiuitie-casters and Fortune-tellers: nor anie birthstarre is able to chaunge or take awaie. Touching their tittle tattle of the kinde and time of death, it is a tale as vaine as the rest. For this is to bée abidden by, that in one skirmish, and in one houre thrée∣score thousand men were slaine, all which (out of doubt) had diuers and sundrie birthstars. It is as true also, that at one instant of time, children haue bene borne, who notwithstanding died at seuerall times. Out of these I conclude, that their superstition is most vaine, which will haue mens chaunces and for∣tunes, subiect to their iudiciall Astrologie. Let them gainsaie what they can, these reasons maie suffice to spie their iugglings, and to auoid their wiles. The birth∣starre
of a man, it dependeth either vpon the time of his conception or begetting, or else vpon the time of his nati∣uitie or birth: but both are vncerteine vnto such, which holding in their hand an Astralobe, stand not by them that are a begetting, and them that are in childbearing. Againe, if the issue of things commonlie called (Lucke) depend vpon the starres, then shall the destinie of all such as haue one and the selfe same birthstarre, be alike: but euerie one that is well in his wits, will saie that this is starke false. If good lucke depend vpon the starres, then shall obedi∣ence to Godward, depend vpon them too. For this is the proper cause of that. Furthermore, if the kind of death, and all manner of misfortunes depend vpon the starres, then shall sinnes depend vpon them too: which is hor∣rible to be spoken. Séeing the case standeth so, I wish the wiser sort to be warned, that as it is méete to sette store by true and naturall Astrologie, which is verie pro∣fitable in our life, and a notable and excellent gifte of God: so to take héede and auoid these deceiuers, these Iacke iugglers, and common Couseners, which professe that they can certeinlie tell, by birthstarres, what good lucke, and what ill lucke, shall light vpon a man, or a woman in this life: speciallie, séeing that superstition is meruellous hurtfull to good manners, flat against honest and good lawes, and as it were a disgracing of God: who witnesseth, his owne selfe, that as a prosperous estate, and happie successe of all things, are the rewards of obe∣dience: so misfortunes, and all kinde of discommodities and mischiefes are the punishments of sinne. As for that which some bring in, going about to make the best of these mens madnesse: to wit, that the starres haue not a sure, a stedfast, & an vndoubted working: A∣gaine, that starres doe gentlie incline or drawe to, and not roughlie compell: I saie so too, so that this inclina∣tion or bending be referred onelie to bodies, and com∣plexions
of bodies, by their leaue: and not vnto the mindes & willes of men, which haue in them , that is, election or choice: which is an abilitie, not bound, but at libertie, whereby the will hauing great choice of things, taketh this and that, according as it is lead: as, to followe vertue, and auoid vice. But this is little agreeable to the goodlie and gaie promises of our Chaldeans, Aegyptians, or Astrologi∣ans, who will haue their Art and cunning so firme, fast, and vnmoueable, as they dare boast, that nothing can be done, but according to the rule and appointment ther∣of. For, an inclination is not a necessarie cause of anie thing, speciallie in men, who maie be gouerned by the iudgement of the minde, euen contrarie to inclination, if it be euill. And, to hold my peace a while, there is no∣thing more foolish and vnfit, than certeinlie to conceiue the effect and full accomplishment of a thing, vpon a péece of a cause, the same being of the basest order, & least force to bring forth an effect and full accomplishment. Now, in that the Mathematicians can foreshew the Eclipses, and change of weather: this commeth to passe, because they depend vpon certeine causes, which causes, according to the ordinance of God, do ueuer alter or va∣rie. And these: to wit, change of weather dependeth vpon the inclination of starres, which inclination neuer decei∣ueth for the most part in things that lacke life. Wherfore as Eclipses stand vpon demonstration: so change of wea∣ther standeth vpon coniecture. It is far otherwise in the reasonable abilities of the minde, speciallie in the wils of men, which are indifferenlie inclined vnto contraries, as hath bene alreadie shewed. Verse. 4. 4 And ye, fathers, prouoke not your children to vvrath, but bring them vp in instruction, and information of the Lord. And ye, fathres, prouoke not your children to anger, but bring them vp in learning, & the rebuking (or feare) of the Lord.
THis is the fourth specialtie, answerable to the for∣mer. For, as that required of children their obedience: so this asketh a dutie of parents, like in proportion and measure towards their children. And in the first place, the Apostle setteth downe, of what things fathers ought to take heede: secondlie, what they ought to do with their children. He giueth them warning, to beware in anie wise of too streight and sharpe handling, seasoned with no loue or gentlenesse. For hard handling, wherein ap∣peareth no fatherlie loue or affection, hath manie incon∣ueniences ioined with it. For, first of all, it maketh their children dizzards, dolts, blocke-heads, heauie-hearted, and dull of spirit. Secondlie, it bréedeth hatred by little and little in their tender mindes, against their parents. Thirdlie, this hatred, which they haue continued, ma∣keth place for stubbornesse and rebellion: so that, when thou wouldest win them by gentlenes & faire meanes, the mischiefe being so far growne, thy labour is but lost. But where parents execute their rule and power well o∣uer their children: there doth authoritie hold them in feare, & willingnesse to obeie▪ and kindnesse keepeth them in loue and readinesse to please. As therefore too much making, and as we saie, cockering of our children, is the next waie to make them sluggards, & wantons: so a wise bringing of them vp, & a right and orderlie vsing of them, maketh them quicke spirited, honest, & thriftie. Now, the apostle addeth, what parents ought to do with their chil∣dren, and that brieflie, when he saith: (But bring them vp in instruction, & information of the Lord.) Saint Paule in this place requireth thrée things of godlie parents. First, (Bringing of them vp,) which thing parents are bound to do to their children, by the lawe of nature. Se∣condlie, (Discipline or instruction,) wherby as their chil∣dren maie be enured to the knowledge of godlie & honest things, euen so they maie be made milde gentle, & cour∣teous: in so much that their wise conuersation and
honest behauing of themselues, shall turne in the end to the comfort and honour of their parents, and to the pro∣fite and commoditie of the Commonwealth. For,  in Gréeke, Instruction in Latine, is a certeine abilitie of the minde, whereby a man is made friendlie to himselfe, and louing to others: which thing doubtlesse cannot come to passe, without honest bringing vp, and well instructing of them in the knowledge of things profitable and necessarie. Héerevpon it is, that this or Instruction, doth signifie sometimes, by the figure Metonymia, the verie instructing it selfe. Againe, because the stint of instruction is humanitie, therfore doth  or instruction, signifie other while, by the figure Prolepsis, humanitie it selfe also: that is to saie, a méeknes, & courtesie in maners, and a tractable∣nesse in a mans whole life. Thirdlie, (Information of the Lord.) The olde Interpreter hath set downeOr Cha∣stisement: The La∣tine copie hath Cor∣reptio, which I cannot more apt∣lie Eng∣lish. Rebu∣king in stéede of Information, which is not well done. For the Gréeke word , betokeneth in generall, such an information, wherby that is put into ones mind, which is néedefull to be done. The genitiue case, Domini, (of the Lord,) is in place of an Adiectiue. For the Apostles meaning is, that such things should be put into tender and young mindes, by dailie admonishments, as tend to true godlinesse, and to the feare of the Lord: besides this also, that they maie be drawne to the learning of such arts and sciences, as they séeme to be most fit for by nature. Nazianzenus writing to Eudoxus the Rhetorician, saith, it was an auncient lawe in Athens: yea, a verie good lawe, which gaue commandement, that so soone as chil∣dren came to yeares of discretion, they should be put out to learne arts & sciences: which thing was done in this manner. There were brought & laid in open place, instru∣ments or tooles belonging to euerie art & occupation: now sir, the youth of that countrie being brought thither, chose
euerie one for himselfe, such tooles as serued that trade of life, wherein they most delighted: héerevpon comman∣dement was giuen by the magistrate, that they should learne that science and occupation, which they had taken themselues vnto, nature hauing giuen plaine proofe ther∣of before. To this perteineth that saieng of the Poet: Tuï nihil, &c. That thing thou shalt not saie, or do, Which Nature noddeth not vnto. It is the parents charge therefore, diligentlie to marke and consider, for what trades of life their children seeme most fit. Let parents also themselues learne first of all héerhence, that God requireth earnestlie at their hands, to instruct their children, euen with their owne voice and information, in true religion. And let none thus thinke with himselfe, that to indue tender & young mindes with doctrines or lessons of godlinesse, belongeth to Church∣men, and Schoolemaisters onelie: but also, that it is the dutie of parents much more to do this: who ought to sowe the séeds of godlinesse in their childrens tender mindes, together with their milke. Let children also learne, that it is their part, not one∣lie to obeie their parents, training them vp in godlinesse: but also to frame their manners & behauiours diligentlie to the rule of godlinesse. They therefore that thinke but so so of the studies & endeuours of godlinesse themselues, or cause others by their meanes, to neglect & passe little for instructing their children, euen in their young years, with all diligence in Christian religion, let them sée to it, what answere they will make vnto our Lord Iesus Christ, who (by the holie mouth of Saint Paule) com∣mendeth euen to children the studie and learning of the holie Scriptures.
Verses. 5. 6. &. 7. 5 Seruants, be obedient vnto them that are your maisters: ac∣cording to the flesh, vvith feare & trembling, in singlenesse of your hearts, as vnto Christ, 6 Not vvith seruice to the eie, as men pleasers: but as the ser∣uants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7 With good vvill seruing the Lord, and not men. Seruants obeie your maisters, according to the flesh, with feare and trembling, in sim∣plicitie of your heart, as vnto Christ, not seruing to the eie as pleasing men, but as the seruants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with good will, seruing the Lord, and not men. AS the Apostle commended before, vnto children, and fathers of families, duties answerable to their cal∣lings: so héere he appointeth seruants their duties to∣wards their maisters, according to the flesh. And although such kinde of seruice, as was vsed in Saint Paules time among manie, is seldome séene among vs: yet notwith∣standing, this precept of Saint Paule, belongeth to our men and maiden seruants. But the circumstances of this precept, are diligentlie to be considered. For, first of all, he requireth at seruants hands, (O∣bedience with feare:) that is to saie, an obedience ioined with a carefull reuerence. Secondlie, his will is, that this obedience should procéed from (Singlenesse of heart:) which kéepeth frowardnesse and hidden hatred out of pos∣session. For, S. Paules meaning is, that the heart should not disagrée from outward obedience. Thirdlie, he set∣teth downe the cause, and the manner, when he saith, (As vnto Christ.) For, the Apostle in these words giueth vs this lesson, that seruaunts should haue an eie, in euerie thing, which they are about, to the will and commaunde∣ment of God. As therfore seruants owe obedience to their masters, for Gods commandement sake: so they shall take héed, that they do nothing, for their bodilie maisters plea∣sure, against the commandement of God. Fourthlie, be∣cause
seruants are woont, for the most part, to serue to the eie, and not to the minde: therefore doth Saint Paule charge Christian seruants to doe their dueties with dili∣gence in the presence of the Lord, Absque , that is to saie, without (Eie-seruice,) and flattering fashion: thinking heerevpon, that the Lord requireth at their hands, a seruice from the heart, with a good minde, and a good will. Furthermore, this place of the Apostle, doth most plain∣lie disproue the errour of the Anabaptists & Libertines, who will haue (forsooth) among Christians a certeine bar∣barous & brutishWhich signifieth rebellion, libertie, an abolish∣ing or vt∣ter dis∣placing of rule & gouerne∣ment, &c Anarchie, that none maie obeie other, but be all alike, chéeke by choule checkmate. For, they de∣fine Christian libertie amisse, in saieng: that it is a kind of manumission or setting frée from all maner of seruice or bondage, as well temporall as ecclesiasticall: not know∣ing this, that Christian libertie consisteth in the spirit, and not in the flesh. Againe, this place both teacheth, and also comforteth godlie seruants. It teacheth them verilie, that the state of life, wherein they liue, pleaseth God, if they behaue them∣selues according to the rule set downe before them by Saint Paule. It comforteth them also, which are kept vn∣der with a seruice somewhat hard and streight, whiles they, learning this lesson of Saint Paule, persuade them∣selues, that they are not onelie subiect to the will of God: but also take this for a sure ground, that God counteth that done to himselfe, which is done with singlenesse to their maisters after the flesh. Let no seruant there∣fore, neither hée nor shée, shake off their yoke of seruice, vnlesse it maie lawefullie bee brought to passe. Verse. 8. 8 And knovve yee, that what∣soeuer good thing anie man doth, that same shall he receiue
of the Lord, whether hee bee bond, or free. Knowing, that euerie one, what good thing soeuer hee doth, shall receiue of the Lord whether he bee bonde, or free. SAint Paule addeth a confirmation or proofe, taken from a well knowne speach vttered in Scripture. For God beateth much vpon this promise euerie where in the Scriptures,Ruth. 2. 12 that he will remember our labour,1. Sam. 26. 23. and the worke of our hands, promising a large reward to all them that obeie his voice.2. Chro. 15. 7. Seruants therefore ought to haue an eie to this promise in their labours and handie works,Psal 18. 20 making this full account,Prou. 13. 21 that God is true & iust in his promises,Esaie. 1. 19 and that the reward promised for their obedience,Esaie. 40. 10. is to be looked for from God. But, because the Papists abuse shamefullie, these and such like saiengs,Esaie. 62. 11. concerning the rewards of good works, to the ouerthrowing of Gods truth touching frée iustifi∣cation:Esaie. 65 6 7. 8. 9. therefore I will brieflie declare, how these and such like saiengs are to be vnderstood,Iere. 31. 14 according to the a∣nalogie,Tob. 4. 19. proportion,Eccle. 11. 17. and rule of faith. First of all we must knowe, that these and such like generall promises,Mat. 7. 11. are to bée applied vnto all men, but not after one and the selfe same manner.Psal. 62. 12 For, there are two sorts of men, according to whose diuersitie, the appli∣cation of the promise must be made. For, some are god∣lie, that is to saie, borne a new, and the children of God. Othersome are vngodlie, not borne a new, and the chil∣dren of wrath. If thou wilt applie the saiengs touching promises of rewards, to the latter sort of men, thou prouest nothing else thereby, but that they remaine the children of wrath, vnder wrath. For, they are able to doe nothing that can please God, although their workes heare an outward shew of speciall holinesse. For, this Oracle of the holie Ghost abideth alwaies sure and stedfast, Impossibile est placere Deo, sine fide: It is vnpossible to please God, without faith.Heb. 11. 6. So long therefore as men are voide of
faith, they are like rotten trées, which can beare no fruit. So that it maie be concluded héerevpon, euen by most manifest and sound proofe, that when God giueth the wicked, the reward due to their works, hell and damna∣tion shall be their recompense. But if thou wilt applie the promises of reward to the former sort of men: to wit, the children of God, then must thou thinke vpon these points in thy mind, orderlie. First of all, thou shalt build vpon this, that the godlie are deli∣uered from the rigour of the lawe, through Christ, as S. Paule saith:Gal. 3. 13. Christus redemit nos, &c. Christ hath re∣deemed vs from the cursse of the lawe,Gal. 4. 4. 5 beeing made a cursse for vs.Tit. 2. 14. The condemning sentence therefore of the lawe, cannot hurt the children of God: that is to saie, the beléeuers. Secondlie thou shalt consider, that the beléeuer maie please God, by faith, and maie be an heire of euerla∣sting life. Thirdlie, thou shalt persuade thy selfe, that God doth not onelie require new obedience at the hands of the beléeuer: but also promiseth a reward: howbeit, not of dutie, for the worthinesse of the worke: but of his méere grace, for his fatherlie promise sake. Fourthlie, thou shalt make this reckoning, that works done by faith, are witnesses of faith: and the effects of faith, most assured signes of their proper cause. Héerevpon God is said to paie euerie man his reward, according to his workes: because works are true euidences of faith, and the feare of the Lord. This solution or answere maie trimlie be made plai∣ner, by a comparison betwéene the heauenlie Father, and an earthlie Father. For, as an earthlie Father doth pro∣mise vnto his children, sometime a large inheritaunce, sometime a rich reward, &c. as the wages or reward for their worke, if they shew themselues dutifull and obe∣dient, although they were not heires before by nature: euen so God the heauenlie Father, promiseth to his chil∣dren, whom he loueth in Christ, euerlasting life, as the
reward for their obedience shewed by faith. The promi∣ses of reward, being thus applied, stirre vp in the godlie an endeuour to obeie: besides that, they make nothing at all for proofe of the Papists wicked doctrine. Verse. 9. 9 And ye maisters, doe the same things vnto them, putting avvaie threatenings: & knowe that euen your maister is in heauen, neither is there respect of person with him. And ye maisters doe ye the same things towards them, let∣ting goe threatenings, knowing that euen your maister also is in heauen, and there is not a∣nie respect of person with him. THis is the last exhortation touching the seuerall du∣ties of one to an other, in their calling: and it an∣swereth that which went next before. The Apostle re∣quireth two things of maisters. The first is, (To do the same things vnto them:) to wit, vnto their seruants, that they kéeping the right rule of proportion, maie shew to their seruants good will againe for their seruice. For, the Apostle doth not require in maisters, such and the like la∣bours, such and the like diligence, such and the like sub∣mission, as he requireth in seruants: but a dutie answe∣rable to their place and person. Let the seruant therefore labour faithfullie, and let the maister againe on the other side, make much of his seruant, giue him his wages for his worke, & sée that hée lacke nothing that is necessarie: all this must be done, (In Domino, In the Lord.) For this is the meaning of the Apostle, when he saith, (, The same things,) to the intent, that a iust proportion of duetie might bée kept, betwéene the maister, and the seruant. The second thing, which the Apostle requireth of maisters, is: (To put awaie threatning.) By which word of (Threatning,) he meaneth all manner of hard handling towardes their seruants.
To this exhortation he addeth a reason drawne from like matters, and saith: (And knowe, that euen your maister also is in heauen.) As if he should saie, There is no cause whie ye shuld ouercrowe your seruants, & think your selues iollie fellowes, in respect of them, for your maistership sake: no, no. For, euen ye your selues haue a maister also in heauen, who can be with you to bring, notwithstanding your maistership, or the pouertie of your seruants, which are not things that he is lead by. For, there is no respect of person with him, as there is with wicked and vniust iudges: but according to the truth & vprightnesse of the cause, so he frameth his iudgement. For the Lord (saith S. Ambrose) is a righteous iudge, looking vpon the cause, and not eieng the person. The word (Person) in this place, doeth not signifie the sub∣stance, but the qualitie: that is to saie, whatsoeuer is regarded in iudgement, besides the trueth of the cause. These wordes therefore (Of respect of persons,) ought not to be wrested to a contrarie meaning. For, there is in them a comparison betwéene God and men Men (for the most part) giue iudgement after the things which they sée with their eies, and which outwardlie ap∣peare: they are moued with linage or birth, with ri∣ches, with kinred, and with friendshippe: againe, some∣times with hatred, with loue, and other affections: whereby it commeth to passe, that they ouerslipping the trueth and equitie of the cause, giue wrong iudge∣ment. As for God, whose iudgement is right, and ac∣cording to truth, he chaungeth not his righteous iudge∣ment for the maisters sake, not yet for the seruaunts sake: but he iudgeth according to the truth of the cause, not hauing anie regard to this or that person. For hée followeth without stint, & incessantlie, this vnremoueable rule of iustice. For, he receiueth the repentant into fauor:
as for the vnrepentant and stubborne, he cannot awaie with them, they are outlawes. Héerehence all godlie maisters haue to learne to hum∣ble themselues before God, who is their maister, as well as their seruants maister: and let them be mindfull, by his example, not to set their seruants at naught, because of their outward person: that is to saie, their vile & base estate: but rather to make more account of them. And whie? For, although the condition of seruaunts differ from that of maisters héere on earth: yet notwith∣standing, they haue all one maister in heauen, whome both of them ought to serue and obeie, as fellowe-ser∣uaunts. Verses. 10. &. 11. 10 Finallie, my brethren, bee strong in the Lord, and in the povver of his might. 11 Put on the vvhole armour of God, that yee maie be able to stand against the assaults of the diuell. Touching that which remai∣neth my brethren, be yee strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, put yee on the whole armour of God, that yee maie be able to stand against the snares of the diuell. THE Apostle returneth to a generall exhortation, where (after the doctrine of grace, after exhortations to vertues worthie of the Gospell, & after peculiar duties belonging to certeine seuerall degrées of men,) he calleth vpon all the godlie, vnder the name of the Ephesians, and exhorteth them to be strong in minde: taking vnto them such armour, as maie withstand the snares of the di∣uell: a verie mightie enimie doubtlesse, if we shall looke vpon his manifolde assaultes, his subtile vnder∣minings, his sundrie waies of laieng in waite, and our owne strength, which is but weaknesse: howbeit, a discomfited enimie, and not able to resist, if we beholde him, in whome resteth our whole power
and valiantnesse. For, when we leane vpon him, with a steddie and sure confidence: it commeth to passe, that the Diuell, be he neuer so big, suffereth shipwracke himselfe, though he stirreth vp tempests, and raiseth stormes, to sinke the seruants of God. In the Apostles words, the manner of exhortation is to be marked. He saith thus, (Be strong in the Lord, & in the power of his might.) First, there is signified vn∣to to vs, by this manner of exhorting, that without the Lord, and without his mightie power, we can preuaile nothing at all, against so terrible and violent an enimie as the Diuell. Secondlie, that we being made members of the Lord, are also made strong by his strength, to resist Sathan and his fierie weapons. Of this strength we are then made partakers, when we trust to, and staie vpon our Lord Christ, with a liue∣lie confidence, when we are made the children of God, and the members of Christ: which is euident by these words of the Apostle,1. Ioh. 5. Haec est victoria, &c. This is the victorie which ouercommeth the world, euen your faith. Therefore, that strength which maketh vs a∣ble to withstand Sathan and the flesh, is not of nature, but of grace. And Christ is that strength, on whom wée laie fast hold by faith. Héereto serueth that saieng of Saint Paule,1. Tim. 18. 19. Milita honestam militiam, &c. Fight a good fight, hauing faith and a good conscience, which some haue put awaie, & as concerning faith haue made shipwracke. And although this strength commeth from the Lord: yea, the Lord himselfe is that strength: yet notwith∣standing, when the Apostle exhorteth vs to (Be strong,) and to (Put on the whole armour of God,) he requireth our trauell and endeuour. It is necessarie therefore, that our will should runne actiuelie therewithall, and not onelie passiuelie. For, as we maie, if we will, cast off faith, and resist the holie spirit: so being conuerted and
turned, we can kéepe faith and the holie spirit by grace, and stirre vp the gift of God in vs,2. Tim. 1. 6. as Saint Paule spea∣keth. For, the gift of God is a certeine quicke and liue∣lie flame, as it were, in the hearts of beléeuers, which Sathan and the flesh can smoother and choke vp: whiles we lie slugging & snorting in our neasts. Wherefore, S. Paules warning to Timothie is not in waste, where he saith:2. Tim. 1. 6. Stirre vp the gift of God which is in thee. This gift therefore must not be quenched and put out. To the same purpose also serueth that saieng of the Apostle to the Thessalonians,1. Thes 5. 19. Quench not the spirit. It is the part of a Christian man therefore to walke warilie, and carefullie before his God: and euermore to take héede, that he lose not the gifte, which he hath re∣ceiued by grace, through his owne slothfulnesse and idle∣nesse. To this belong all exercises of goodlinesse, all ex∣hortations of godlie Shepheards, and the whole dis∣cipline of the Church. For, these are certeine bel∣lowes, as it were, which doe quicken and raise vp the flame kindeled in vs from aboue, by Gods good grace. Moreouer, this place of Saint Paule doeth teach all the godlie, that they are set in a verie hot and heauie skir∣mish, where they must fight it out, euerie one in his standing: looking for no truce, because there is none to be graunted. For, our aduersarie is alwaies harnessed, weaponed, and keeping the field. And indéede (as Saint Peter saith) He neuer resteth raunging vp and downe,1. Pet. 5. 8. roaring (like a Lionesse that hath lost her whelpes,) and seeketh whom he may deuoure. This doth he one while by offering open violence, another while by craftie sai∣eng in waite. For, when he putteth men in the head, to cast from them, as a thing of naught, the doctrine of God: when he bringeth in a traine of most filthie manners, slatte a∣gainst the lawe of God: when he filleth all places with
offenses, and slaughters: then offereth he open violence, and professeth himselfe the sworne enimie of Christ. But when he disguiseth himselfe into an angel of light, and putteth vpon vices the vizards of vertues: when he gi∣ueth superstition a counterfaite face of holinesse: when he dealeth in this wise, then he lieth in waite craf∣tilie to catch vs. To them therefore, which are not furnished with the whole armour of GOD, the diuell is more terrible, furious, violent, and preuai∣ling. What shall we gather by this? Séeing the life of a Christian in this world, is a certeine spirituall warfare and that against so mightie an enimie: it is méete vere∣lie, that we be like to, and also plaie the part of va∣liant hearted souldiers, whom swilling, surfetting, or sléeping make not slouthfull & heauie-headed, béeing to séeke in the time of most néede: but alwaies prouided and prepared at the pinch, readie to fight with their eni∣mies, hand to hand: least they should be sette vpon, and ouerrunne at vnwares. Thus if we doe, we néed doubt no daunger. For, when the Apostle addeth these words, (That ye maie be able to stand against the as∣saults of the diuell,) he meaneth, that we shall ouercome, and get the victorie, if we holding fast the armour, which God reacheth out and giueth vs, shall fight stoutlie vnder Christs banner, hauing full confidence in him. The rightest waie to ouercome this inuisible enimie, is, if thou begin with thine inward and houshold enimie, to tame him, & bring him vnder. This enimie is the flesh, a∣gainst whom the spirit maketh batell. For the flesh temp∣teth vs with nothing, but that fleshlie thing, which bea∣reth rule in vs: & thither she bendeth her full force, whi∣ther she séeth men inclined of their owne accord. And so ye flesh turneth our owne weaknesse, to the weapons of her wickednesse, & vseth the disease of our owne flesh against our selues: that is to saie, setteth vpon vs with our owne
affections, lusts, and desires, as it were with warlike en∣gines. But if anie one demand, why God giueth the Di∣uell leaue to haunt and laie such hard hold at mankind, in this manner? Athanasius answereth in these words: That they (saith he) which loue God,In his e∣leuenth question to Antio∣chus. maie bee made manifest: and they that are giuen to vaine pleasures maie be turned off, and put awaie. For, if there were no enimies to make warre, how should the valiant souldi∣ers of a king be tried? To them therefore that loue God, the Diuell is made the cause of victorie, of their crowne or garland, of their reward and triumph. Thus farre Athanasius. But I aunswere in a word, that it is Gods decrée and appointment, to haue all his children made like vnto his sonne, in the crosse and per∣secution, whom his purpose was long agoe, to glorifie with his sonne. Verse. 12. 12 For, vve vvrestle not against flesh and bloud, but against principalities, and against povv∣ers, & against the worldlie go∣uernors, the princes of the dark∣nesse of this vvorld, against spi∣rituall vvickednesses, vvhich are in the high places. Because our wrestling is not against flesh and bloud, but against principalities (or rules,) against powers, against the worldlie gouernours of the darknesse of this world, against spirituall wickednesses, in hea∣uenlie places. THis is a reason of the exhortation, drawne from the greatnesse of the daunger. For, after he hath set foorth the fearefull power of a fearefull enimie, he stirreth vp the Ephesians to the greater watchfulnesse, least they should suffer themselues to be ouerrunne of so craftie and mightie an enimie. For, the Apostle declareth and laieth open before our eies, the forces of our enimies to this ende: that thereby he might make vs the more
readie and couragious to fight. Now, in that the Apo∣stle saith, (We wrestle not against flesh and bloud,) hee doth not denie, that we must haue a skirmishing against men, and our owne flesh: but he speaketh by waie of comparison, as if he should saie thus: If we looke vpon the spirituall enimies, whom we haue haunting vs, that skirmishing shall be accompted no fight, which is be∣twéene vs and flesh and bloud. By this manner of speach therefore, the greatnesse of the daunger, the kinde of the battell, and the qualitie of the enimies, are signified and meant. Our enimies are not flesh and bloud: therefore our enimies are spiritu∣all. The battell which we must abide, is spirituall, doubt∣full, and daungerous: therefore spirituall weapons are required, as S. Paule also putteth vs in minde, saieng: Non sunt carnalia,2. Co. 10. &c. The weapons of our warrefare, are not carnall, but mightie through God: that is to saie, spirituall. Now, when the Apostle calleth our enimies, (Prin∣cipalities, powers, &c.) he doth not reckon vp diuers or∣ders and degrées of diuels: but he describeth the pow∣er of those same enimies, by sundrie names. For, when he calleth diuels, by the name of , that is to saie, (Principalities) and Empires, he doeth not onelie admo∣nish vs, that they are not enimies lightlie to be set by▪ as though they were not able to make anie power, or had not in them strength to resist: but he also requi∣reth vs, to shake off their yoke, and cast it from vs: which we then doe, when we defie and forsake them, by faith and trust in Christ. For, they beare rule o∣uer none, but such, as of their owne accord, put their neckes vnder the yoke, and are content to weare it▪ For, principalitie and subiection are correlatiues: that is to saie, things of such a qualitie, that where the one is, the other must be. Againe, when the Apostle calleth diuels :
that is to saie, (Powers,) by which hée signifieth, a right in ruling: which diuels execute and put in vre ouer men, for sinnes sake, and that by Gods iust iudg∣ment. By this name therefore we are put in minde, to flie from all and euerie sinne, as béeing deliuered from sinne by and through Christ, least the diuell make claime to his right, and get rule ouer vs againe. The name which followeth next, is : that is to saie, rulers of the world: which signifieth, that diuels haue the ouersight and dealing in euill deedes one∣lie, and that they hold them vnder their yoke, which are intangled & caught with the baits of worldlie desires. For this word (World) doth not signifie in this place, this goodlie frame and compasse, created of God, and fur∣nished with store of all things, which God alone fashio∣ned and made of his goodnesse for man to liue in: but it signifieth worldlie minded men, sléeping in sinne, and the verie sinnes themselues: as plainlie is proued by the ex∣position following, when he defineth the world to be dark∣nesse. Now, it is commonlie knowne, that by darknesse, the ignoraunce of God, and anie other sinne whatsoeuer, is meant. As therefore Christ ruleth and gouerneth them, which are light: so the diuell pricketh forward, and throweth headlong into all mischiefe and villanie, those that are darknesse. Lastlie, when Saint Paule addeth these words: (Against spirituall wickednesses, which are in the high places,) he giueth vs thereby to note, the nature of our enimies. For, they are spirituall enimies. Thereby also he sheweth vs, that they are swift and in∣uisible: by the former we are willed to take heed, because the daunger is great: by the latter to beware, because the snares and assaults are secreat. For, when our enimies are inuisible, they are about our ouerthrowe, e∣uen then, when we doe least of all thinke it. We ought therefore to bée precise and warie, least we be set vpon,
sooner than wée thinke. Héereto serueth the word (Wickednesses,) whereby, as the endeuour and order of diuels to deceiue is signifi∣ed: so are the godlie warned, continuallie to watch and ward against so wicked and mischieuous an enimie, who will take no conditions of trace, nor enter into anie league, vnlesse we yéelde vp our selues wholie vnto his power and rule, renouncing the faith of Christ. Touching that which is added: to wit, (In the high or heauenlie places:) it is diuerslie expounded. Saint Am∣brose vnderstandeth the firmament of the world, by high or heauenlie places: other some vnderstand thereby, this darke and mistie aier: other vnderstand by it, heauen∣lie things: for which (saie they) is all this fighting and skirmishing. For, this battell is taken in hand, not a∣bout the kingdomes of the world, but about heauenlie things. And surelie, although the matter be so indéed: yet notwithstanding, the plainer meaning is this: to wit, that the place is noted from whence our enimies shall lay load at vs. For, they set vpon vs from aloft, & are euen vpon our neckes: in such sort, that they neuer rest from trieng of masteries, no not the twinkling of an eie. This therfore wherto serueth it? Euen to put vs in mind, how doubtfull & dangerous an encounter it is, to come out & wage battell with such an enimie, who can, euen by the nature of his place easilie set vpon vs, soone downe with vs vnderfoote, & dispatch vs with the turning of an hand. Verse. 13. 13 For this cause take vnto you the whole armour of God, that ye maie be able to resist in the euill daie, and hauing fini∣shed all things, stand fast. Take vnto you therefore the whole armour of God, that ye maie be able to resist in the e∣uill daie, and stand fast when all things are finished. THis is a conclusion and repetition of the proposition, which is entered in this manner. The enimies
of the Church are mightie and malicious: therefore it is méete, that Christians, being furnished with the whole armour, or complet harnesse of God, set themselues a∣gainst their enimies: at this time speciallie, when all things are full of doubts, troubles, and dangers. For, the Apostle calleth the whole time of skirmishing, by the name of (The euill daie:) which indéed is not euill of it selfe, or by nature: but it is called euill, in respect of the troubles and dangers which then doe chaunce. The reason of the proposition rehearsed, is verie full of com∣fort. For, it promiseth, that the children of God shall certeinlie haue the victorie, if so be they hold out, and abide the brunts stoutlie, vnder the banner of Christ. For, when the Apostle saith, (And hauing finished all things, stand fast,) he requireth labour in skirmishing, without wearinesse, and continuall constancie, euen till the encounter be done: that is to saie, euen to the end of this fraile life, after which shall followe a glorious tri∣umph ouer our enimies. Out of this place of Saint Paule, our Auncients séeme to haue taken the difference of the Church, calling one, The Church militant: the other, The Church trium∣phant: not that they are two sundrie Churches: but be∣cause of the condition of the citizens of the same Church. For, whiles we are in this life, our whole life is a kinde of warfare against the flesh, the world, and the diuell. To this perteineth that saieng of Iob,Iob. 7. 1. 2. Militia est vita no∣stra super terram, Our life is a warfare vpon earth. But when we shall depart out of this life, we shall be parta∣kers of Christs triumph, so that we shall be no more in daunger of Sathans deadlie shot. Verse. 14. 14 Stand therefore, and your loines girt about vvith veritie. Stand therefore, and your loines girded about with truth.
NOw followeth a declaration of the armour of God, which Saint Paule would haue vs weare, against the snares and assaults of the diuell: wherein (by the fi∣gures Hypotyposis, and Metaphora, he describeth the spirituall armour of our mindes, making an allusion to the armour of the souldiers of this world. And first of all, the Apostle will haue vs gird vp our loines with truth. What this should meane shall soone appeare, when the Metaphore is made more plaine. For, as the loines, wherein the speciall power & strength of the bodie doth lie, are girt vp with a girdle, least the souldier in fighting should fall and miscarrie: so the minde must be made steddie & fast, with the truth of God, least the diuell laie vs along the more easilie, and slaie vs the sooner, when hée findeth vs doubtfull, wauering, and inconstant. Let the minde therfore of a Christian souldier, whiles he is in this hot skirmish, bee first of all persuaded of Gods truth. Héereth serueth that saieng of our Lord in the Gospell:Luke. 12. 35. Sint lumbi vestri, &c. Let your loines bee girded about, & your lights burning. This spéech of our Sauiour Christ, requireth as well constancie in doctrine, as also innocencie in manners. And Saint Peter saith, Praecincti lumbis,1. Pet. 1. 13 &c. Wherefore, gird vp the loines of your minde: be sober, and trust perfectlie on the grace that is brought vnto you, by the the reuelation of Iesus Christ. Verse. 14. 14 And hauing on the brest plate of righteousnesse. VVearing on the brest plate of righteousnesse. HEere the brest is defended. For, as the brest plate defendeth the brest of a wordlie souldier, so innocen∣cie of life, or righteousnesse, defendeth a mans minde, and so harnesseth it, that the weapons of the diuell haue no
power to pearse vnto the heart, and to quench the reli∣gion of Christ, there abiding. Verse. 15. 15 And your feet shod vvith the preparation of the Gospell of peace. Your feet shod with the prepara∣tion of the Gospell of peace. AS souldiers defend their féet, to the end they maie bée safe, when they are going to battell: so it behoueth Christian souldiers to be shod with the Gospell: to the intent they maie holde out stoutlie in skirmish, not be∣ing once harmed. For this worde (Preparation,) the Greekes vse, , whereby is signified a certeine readinesse and chéerfulnesse, wherewith the faithfull doe embrace the Gospell of peace. The Genitiue case (Pa∣cis, of peace) hath the place of an Epitheton, or Adiectiue: and vnder the name of (Peace,) the fruit of the Gospell is meant. For, the Gospell is a proclamation touching the attonement and reconciliation betwéene God & vs. Verse. 16. 16 Aboue all, take the shield of faith, vvherewith yee maie quench all the fierie darts of the vvicked. Aboue all things, taking vnto you the shield of faith, wherewith ye maie be able to put out all the darts of the wicked. AS the whole bodie is defended and saued with the shield, that it maie be kept safe from blowes, and wounds: so an ardent and vndoubted faith kéepeth and defendeth the minde euerie where from hauing hurt. And as the shield is held out, to beare off the darts & strokes of our enimies weapons: so a true faith ought to be set against all kinde of temptations. Touching this mat∣ter, there are more examples rehearsed in the Epistle to the Hebrewes. The Apostle calleth deadlie darts, (Fie∣rie darts:) by the figure Metalepsis. For he alludeth to the
fashion and dealing of warriours, who in olde time, besméered the heads of their dartes with poison, that the bodies of the wounded might so bée inflamed, as that it should not be possible to heale them, and make them sound againe. Verse. 17. 17 And take the helmet of saluation. And take the helmet of health, (or saluation.) AS the head béeing defended with an helmet, is safe: so hope of saluation to come, must be set flat against euerie assault of the diuell. For, from this hope springeth most abundant comfort in all aduersities. It is called (The helmet of saluation,) by the figure Metonymia: to wit,1. Thes. 5. 8. because it saueth harmelesse. This helmet of saluation, our Apostle calleth by the name of hope, in his Epistle to the Thessalonians. Verse. 17. 17 And the sword of the spi∣rit, vvhich is the vvord of God. is And the sword of the spirit, which Gods word. THus farre the Apostle hath armed a Christian soul∣dier, with those weapons and harnesse, where∣with hée maie safelie withstand the assaultes of the di∣uell. Now he deliuereth him in hand a sword, with the which hée maie set vpon his enimie, and driue him backe. And because the enimie is spirituall, it is con∣uenient, that the sword also be spirituall, where∣with hée maie be put to flight: euen the same sword, which the Lorde himselfe smote Sathan withall, and made him take his héeles, when he presumed to tempt and encounter with Christ.Math. 4. 1 2. 3, &c. This is the sword of the Lordes owne mouth, wherewith hée
slaieth the vngodlie. For, so often as we giue the diuell the foile, by the word of the Lord, he is laid along with the sword of the Lords owne mouth. But héede must be had héere, least we be entangled in the error of the Papists, & embrace the letter for the spi∣rit. For, the words of the Apostle are not meant of anie sorcerous rehearsall of words, or of the cast of coniuring, spoken & done according to the words specified (as though there were some forceablenesse in the sound of the words, besides that which it hath by the ordinance & appoint∣ment of God:) neither are they meant of the writing of the words, and the hanging of them about our necke: (as they thought, the beginning of Saint Iohns Gospell, written in fine parchment, and hanged about ones necke, to be the same swords of the spirit, which S. Paule speaketh of in this place.) But the word of God, then: yea, euen then, is the spirituall sword, when it is force∣able in vs by faith, and when it is written in the tables of our heart, by the spirit of God. For then in déede this sword is fit, and serueth well, for the defacing and dis∣patching of our aduersarie the diuell. Héerehence it appeareth, how cruell a tyrant Anti∣christ of Rome is, who bestirres him all that he maie, to take from Gods people this sword of the spirit: not onlie by falsifieng & wresting the Scripture to a contrarie and vnnaturall meaning: but also by making lawes, that it should not be set forth in a common and knowne tongue, for the behoofe of Gods Church, that euerie one might read and vnderstand it. Verse. 18. 18 And praie alvvaies, vvith all manner praier, and suppli∣cation, in the spirit: and vvatch therevnto vvith all perseue∣rance and supplication for all Saints, and for me. Praieng alwaies in spirit, with all manner of praier and sup∣plication: and watching to this end, with all continuance (or instance) and supplication, for all Saints, and for me.
THe Apostle hauing furnished the Christian souldier, with double armour, bringeth him vnto his Captaine, to march stoutlie and manfullie vnder his banner: and if the skirmish bée too daungerous, to flie for suc∣cour vnto his Captaine, least he be ouertroden of his mightie and strong enimie. For, by praier we come to Christ our Captaine: prouided alwaies, that this praier be not a babbling with the lips: but a lifting vp of the heart in faith vnto God, ioined with a deuout sound of the mouth, all béeing done with a sure tr, and confidence in Christ our mediatour. Now, what it is to praie in spirit, Saint Ambrose sheweth by a verie trimme antithesis or opposition, in these words: Hoc est ergo, &c. This is therefore to praie alwaies in spirit, euen to make our praiers vnto God, with a cleane conscience, and an vpright faith. For, hee praieth in the flesh, which praieth with a defiled mind. Thus farre hée. As for that which is added: to wit, (For all Saints, & for me,) it serueth to this end, that the endeuour of suc∣couring and assisting one an other in this spirituall war∣fare, might bée commended vnto vs. For, we ought to vse these two weapons: namelie, (The sword of the spi∣rit,) and (Praier,) not onelie in defence of our selues: but also for the helping and aiding of others, speciallie, when we sée them in danger. And although we must praie for all men: yet notwithstanding, we must haue principall care and regard to the Saints: that is to saie, to them that are ioined with vs by faith and loue, béeing in déede members of one, and the same mysticall bodie, as well as we. Touching the words of the Apostle last set downe: (And for me,) they put the godlie in minde of their due∣tie: which is, to praie continuallie for the ministers of Gods word, and for the preseruation and maintenance of their ministerie.
Verses. 19. &. 20. 19 That vtterance maie bee giuen vnto me, that I maie o∣pen my mouth boldlie, to pub∣lish the secret of the Gospell, 20 Whereof I am the Ambas∣sadour in bonds, that therein I maie speake boldlie, as I ought to speake. That speech maie be giuen me, in the opening of my mouth, with boldnesse, that I maie vt∣ter (or declare) the mysterie of the Gospell, whereof I beare ambassage in chaines, that I maie behaue my selfe boldlie therein, a sit becommeth me to speake. THe causes whie Saint Paule desireth the Ephesians to praie for him, are set downe, & they are thrée in num∣ber. The first, (That he might open his mouth boldlie:) that is to saie, that a constant mind might be giuen vnto him, whereby to confesse and professe the doctrine of the Gospell, without feare, before the whole world. For, he calleth the opening of the mouth, a frée confession of doc∣trine, simple, plaine, cléere, without dissembling, counter∣feiting, and cauilling, without feare, and doubting to displease, which often times doth so shut vp and make fast the mouthes of a great manie, as they remember not, that it is the ambassage of Christ Iesus, which they haue in charge. Héere all the godlie, and speciallie the ministers of Gods word, are admonished, what boldnesse of confession ought to be in them: to wit, that no feare, no heauinesse, no threatenings, no torments make them giue ouer: but that they maie teach and preach the Gospell with a courage. The second cause is, (That I should publish the secret of the Gospell.) For, this is peculiar to Paule, and the ministers of the word, that by preaching, euen with their owne voice, they should publish the secret of the Gospell. This place therefore is at defiance with the Anabaptists, who coutemning the worde vttered by voice, looke for reuelatious, visions, inspirations, and I wot not what. But what is that which is added.
