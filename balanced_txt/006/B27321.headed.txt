The new way of. LOVE is the cause of my Mourning, To it's own Proper Tune. 1 WHEN Strephon the Heart of fair Iris possest, 'mongst all the young Shepherds she loved him best No Swain in a Mistress so fully was blest, For he was both her Friend and her Lover: Long did he court her Affection in vain, Till at length soft Compassion triumph'd o'er Disdain That she heard all his Sighs, and she felt all his Pain Then the Swain found the Art how to move her. Heavens did both their Souls inspire Then with an equal Fire, Both had but one Desire, Both Hearts were burning. O then, my dear Iris I little did fear, Love would be the Cause of my Mourning! 2 Iris, the sprightly, the witty and gay, Whose Charms all bewitching and fragrant like May Will ever be blooming and never decay; She was all my Delight and my Pleasure: Returned all my Vows, and so kind she did prove, Each Smile and each Glance encreased our Love, And taught how I might the dear Minutes improve, I envyed no Monarch his Treasure. But oh alas! that cused Fate, Hath chang'd her Mind of late, Her Love is turned to Hate, And I now forlorn, Like an innocent Turtle: thats left by its Mate Do remain in sad Anguish and Scorn. 3 Since Iris condems me, and will not allow To hear the Defence of a Lover so true, To any new Beauty I'll scorn e'er to bow; What I lov'd once will charm me for ever. Tho my Vows and my Sighs are returned with Disdain I'll suffer her Martyr, and never complain: My Sou'ls so fast lock'd, and in Love with its Chain No new Beauty has Power to discover, And now banished from her Sight And rob'd of all Delight, I'll take a longsome Flight Without e'er returning. And concealing her Name, to th' World I'll proclaim That Love's been the cause of my Mourning. FINIS,
