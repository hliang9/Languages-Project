And with Advice and Consent foresaid did Au∣thorize and impower the Lords of Our privy Council, to prescribe such other Methods and Orders as they should judge necessar, for making the said Act effectual, and We considering the great hinderance the Tacksmen of Our said Additional Excise meet with in the several Shires, for uplifting the said Three pennies, and two shilling of Excise imposed in manner foresaid, by the not meeting of the Commissioners of Supply, duely and frequently, to determine all differences between the Brewers and Tacksmen, their Sub-tracksmen & Collectors, and for want of orderly & rimous Entries by the Brewers, of all Liquors browen by them lyable to the said Excise, wherethrow great Loss and Prejudice doth arise to that Branch of the Supply granted to Us thereby: For Remeed whereof, We with Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, strictly Require and Command, the whole Commissioners of Supply in all the Shires within this Kingdom, qualified according to Law, and who by the said Act of Parliament, are appointed Commissioners of the said Additional Excise, to meet at the Head burghs of their respective Shires, at the days respective following, viz: These on this side of the River of Tay, upon the second Tuesday of January next, and these on the other side of the said River of Tay, upon the Third Tuesday of the said Moneth, and at their Meetings to settle and appoint places, such as they shall find most convenient, where publick Excise-offices shall be keeped, for the Brewers to enter and give up the quantities of the Liquors browen by them, lyable in payment of the said Excise;
