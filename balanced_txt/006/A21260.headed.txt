TO THE RIGHT VVorshipfull his very good Pa∣trone, ROVVLAND TRAPS Esquire, the Author, wisheth all true happinesse, both temporall and eternall in the Lord Iesus. COnsidering with my selfe (Right worshipfull) how much I am bound to glorifie GOD, to whom I owe my selfe, and al whatsoeuer I am, and that in speciall sort I am bound to seeke the aduancement of his name in that holy cal∣ling and seruice, wherewith he hath honoured me, (the vnworthiest of all other) in doing good to his Church, and especially to those ouer whom he hath set me, as a guide to direct and conduct in the way that leades to eternall blisse and glory; and consi∣dering withall mine owne weakenesse and inabi∣lity
(more then ordinary in other men) to answer that duty incumbent and lying vpon me; I haue beene moued, (being thereunto often and earnestly importuned by many, by whose motion, the Lord seemes to require it at my hands) to send foorth this part of my poore labours, to the view of all that shall please to looke vpon it, and so to imploy that talent the Lord hath trusted me withall, to the greatest aduantage that I can, and to vse the best meanes I am able, of furthering the good of Gods Church, and heereby in some measure, to make supply of that, which (through my knowne debi∣litie of body) is wanting in the discharge of my Pastorall function. And howsoeuer these my poore labours bee not worthy the veiw of the learned and iudicious, being simple, plaine, and popular, both for matter and manner, yet (I hope) they are sound, and without corruption, and will not bee vnprofitable to the simple, and honest hearted, who want those speciall endowments of lear∣ning, and depth of iudgement, and yet are desirous to bee informed in the mystery of godlinesse, to their sauing comfort, and especially to those that are of my charge, whose profit in holy things, I chiefely tender, and to whom my labours are most familiar, and principally due. It grieues not mee now againe, to recommend to their eies the things which heeretofore haue beene sent by their eares to their mindes, and (I hope) to their hearts; and though I cannot precisely say as the Apostle Peter did, I know that the time is at hand that I must lay
downe mine earthly tabernacle; yet that time bee¦ing vncertaine, and hauing had many times warning to bethinke my selfe of my vncertaine continuance in this life, hauing sometimes recei∣ued the sentence of death in my selfe, that I should not trust in my selfe, but in God,2 Cor. 1.9. who raiseth the dead; I thinke it meete, as long as I am in this ta∣bernacle to stirre them vp by putting them in re∣membrance, and to endeauour that they may bee able to haue remembrance of these things after my departing.2 Pet. 1.13.15 In the Epistles of the blessed Apostle Paul, and in this, written to the Colossians, most clearely and plainely men may see, and heare what the Lord saith to his Church, and what he requireth at the hands of all Christians, both for matter of faith, and of practise, and that both in generall, and in particular duties: yet in reading this and other Scriptures, it is not safe to goe alone, (vnlearned and vnstable soules peruert somethings in them to their owne destruction) a guide (as the Eunuch confessed) is of necessarie vse.2 Pet. 3.16. Act. 8.31. I haue therefore by these my poore labours, shewed my selfe willing to be helpefull vnto such as stand in neede of dire∣ction, and want better guides; and I haue endea∣uoured to point out the way, whereby they may come to some measure of right vnderstanding and sauing knowledge of that holy and heauenly truth that is reuealed in this diuine Epistle, and my ear∣nest desire is, that the readers whosoeuer, would bring to the reading of these my slender paines,
humble and teachable hearts, and such as are plyable to the truth, and that they would lay aside all preiudicate and forestalled thoughts, and parti∣all affections,Ehes. 4.15. and set themselues both to seeke and to follow the truth in loue. My method is not curious or hidden, but plaine and open, and for the most part one and the same, the simplest reader endued with any discretion, may obserue that the coherence, and parts of the Text being laid forth, the sense and meaning of it is giuen (wherein I hope the Lord hath directed me, according to my desire, to finde the right) and then doctrines are thence raised, which being clea∣red and confirmed, and occurrent doubts re∣mooued, such vse and application is made, as my shallow braine conceiued most properly, sorting and suiting to the subiect matter in hand, the heads of doctrines and vses, are thorow out in the mar∣gent. Such as thinke my labours for their vse, may please to vse them, and finding good by them, let them blesse God for it, and yeeld all praise and glo∣rie to him, to whom onely of right it belongs; and such as are otherwise conceited, I intreat to take my good meaning in good part, and to leaue them to others, who like better of them, and my selfe to stand or fall to mine owne Master,Rom. 14.4.10 before whose iudgement seat we must all one day appeare. And now (right worshipfull) since it pleased the Lord to make you the meanes of giuing me a com∣fortable accesse to my charge, (wherein I haue exercised my Ministry this tenne yeeres, and vp∣wards)
howsoeuer in much weakenesse, yet the Lord vouchsafing strength, aboue, and beyond mine owne expectation, and the conceit of others, for which (as I am euer bound to praise the name of the Lord) I doe freely, and thankfully acknow∣ledge your vndeserued loue and fauour towards me therein, and resting assuredly vpon the conti∣nuance of your wonted loue and kindenesse to me ward, I make bold to shelter these my poore la∣bours (beeing part of my paines taken in my charge) vnder your name and Patronage; I doubt not but as my selfe haue found you a kinde and friendly Patrone, so these my labours comming vnto you submissiuely (as they doe) shall finde your fauourable countenance towards them, and you will bee pleased to vouchsafe them your best protection. Accept (I pray you) this poore mite I now tender vnto you, in stead of some rich pledge of my vnfained loue and thankfulnesse. I doe hear∣tily wish, and earnestly desire of the Lord, that as you haue beene the meanes (in some sort) of the being of these labours of mine, so they may re∣turne vnto you in way of thankefulnesse, some spi∣rituall good, which I hope, they shall, the Lord blessing your carefull and frequent perusall of them. Thus being loath to be tedious and troublesome vnto you, I commend this silly present to your fauourable acceptation, and your selfe, to the gracious protection of the Lord,1 Tim. 4.8. who grant you euer that grace that hath the promise, both of
this life, and of that which is to come. So I pray, and will (God willing) not cease to pray for you. From Barmondsey neare London, March the 6th. 1614. Your Worships to command in the Lord. EDVVARD ELTON.

AN EXPOSITION of the Epistle to the Colossians, deliuered in certaine Sermons. CHAP. I VERS. I. Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother. THIS Epistle was written by S. Paul,The generall resolution of ths Epistle. The time and place when this Epistle was written. The occasion of the writing of this Epistle. when he was prisoner at Rome. The occasion of the writing of it was a report brought vnto him concer∣ning the estate of the Church at Co∣losse, that after they of that Church had beene conuerted by Epaphras to the faith of Christ, and instructed in the truth of religion, according to the doctrine of the Apostles, they were in danger to be seduced by false tea∣chers, raised vp by Sathan, who sought to impose and thrust vpon them the obseruation of circumcision and certaine rites of the ceremoniall law abolished by Christ, and to entangle them by many philosophicall speculati∣ons, and to bring in the worship of Angels, and many o∣ther sorts of will worship deuised by themselues. The A∣postle
hearing of this imminent danger like to fall vpon them, was induced to write this Epistle vnto them, as an Antidote against poison, and a remedie against these euils. The summe and substance of this EpistleThe summe and substance of this Epistle. is thus much: That the Colossians ought to continue constant in the doctrine of saith deliuered vnto them by Epaphras, and to auoid the corruption of flattering nouelties and deceiuers, and to ioine to constancie in faith, study, care, and practise of good life; to which purpose he subioines many exhor∣tations both generall and speciall.The diuision of this Epistle. The materiall parts of this Epistle, besides the Proeme and the Conclusion, are two  The first is concerning Christian doctrine, in the two first  Chapters. The second touching Christian life and conuer∣sation, in the two chapters following. And so much be spo∣ken of the general, resolution of this Epistle. The summe and diuision of the first Chapter.And to omit further subdiuision, this first Chapter containe, foure parts: The first is a comprehension of such things as are premitted in the first and second verse. The  second is the proeme or entrance, standing on a congratu∣lation  and comprecation, from the third verse to the 12.  The third is a summarie declaration of the doctrine of Christian faith, from the 12. verse to the three and twen∣tieth.  The fourth is an exhortation to a constant continu∣ance in that doctrine, from the 23. verse to the end of the Chapter. And so much of the first Chapter in generall. Touching the first part,The argu∣ment and sub∣diuision of the first part. containing things premitted, therein is offered to our consideration the sender of this Epistle, the parties to whom it was sent, and the salutation of them. The sender in the first verse, Paul, who ioineth to himselfe Timothie a brother. And he describeth himselfe by his office and the efficient cause of it, that hee was an Apostle, and designed to that office by the will of God. The parties to whom it was sent, are set downe in the second verse, namely the Colossians, who are set out by three epi∣thites, Saints, faithfull, brethren, and all these in Christ. Then followeth the salutation in the last words, wherein the
Apostle wisheth and praieth for two things to be giuen, Grace and peace, and both these from God the fountaine of all good things, and from him as hee is our father in Christ, and from the Lord Iesus Christ the Mediator, by whom all good things come. And so much be spoken in generall of the first part of this Chapter. Come we now to speake of the first verse of this Chapter. Paul an Apostle.Paul descri∣bed by his office.] The word Apostle in generall accep∣tion signifies one sent as a Messenger: in the New Testa∣ment with this addition [of Iesus Christ] it signifies more specially one called immediately by Christ to preach the Gospell, and by him sent to the whole world, without li∣mitation, and to that end furnished with vnderstanding and knowledge of the Gospell, and doctrine of saluation, immediately by the inspiration and reuelation from the spirit of Christ, hauing infallible assistance and testimonie of the holy Ghost, that hee cannot erre in executing his Apostolical office, and hauing also the gift of working mi∣racles, of conferring the holy Ghost by laying on of hands and of correction, as Peter corrected Ananias and Saphira, Act. 5. The meaning then of Paul in saying an Apostle of Iesus Christ, is this, that he was thus called to be an Apostle thus furnished, & had this assistance, testimonie and pow∣er by the will of God, that is, by the eternall counsell and purpose of God, who as he saith Gal. 1.15. separated him, &c. The words then are thus to be vnderstood, that Paul was immediately called by Christ to the office of an Apo∣stle, and sent by him to preach the Gospell to the whole world, and to that end furnished with knowledge of the doctrine of saluation by immediate inspiration of the spi∣rit of Christ, with the infallible assistance of the spirit, and designed to that office by the eternall counsell and pur∣pose  of God. Come we to the doctrine. First,Euery true teacher is able to shew his commis∣sion. it is to be mar∣ked that Paul here stands vpon his office and calling, that he is an Apostle immediately called and sent, and this hee doth almost in the beginning of euery one of his Epistles,
to put a difference between himselfe and false Apostles; whence only note we thus much,Note. that all true teachers are able to shew their commission that they are lawfully called and sent to preach, that they haue both the inward and outward lawfull calling. Christ himselfe tooke not on him the office of Mediator, nor the office and honour to bee made the high Priest, but as he was called to it of his father Heb. 5.5. Much lesse ought any to take on him the office of a publike teacher without lawfull calling. And there∣fore it is Anabaptisticall to thinke that any man that will may preach without speciall calling. A word is sufficient of that point. In that Paul was an Apostle of Iesus Christ, one immediately called and sent sent by him to preach the gospell, it followeth vpon this necessarily, that his doctrine deliuered in this, and in his other Epistles, is heauenly, and is to be embraced, beleeued, and followed as the doctrine of Christ Iesus. For why? his doctrine being giuen by in∣spiration of the spirit of Christ, both for matter and man∣ner, he teaching as hee was acted and moued by infallible assistance of the spirit of Christ, it must needs be the vn∣doubted oracle and immediate word of Christ, and so to be receiued. Paul therefore giues thankes to God on the behalfe of the Thessalonians, Thes. 1.2.13. that they recei∣ued of him and other Apostles the word of the preaching of God, not as the word of men, but as it was indeed the word of God. Obiection.  Some may say Paul spake and deliuered some things in writing not giuen by inspiration of the spirit of Christ, but of himselfe, as hee saith to the remnant I speake,1. Cor. 7.12. and not the Lord, and therefore some things recorded in the Epistles of Paul are not to be recei∣ued as the word of Christ. Answer.  The meaning of that place alleadged is that the Lord had not giuen any such expresse commandement as Paul there deliuered, but he by collection and interpreta∣tion of the Scripture did gather it, & so speake not of him∣selfe, but by the assistance of the spirit of God, as wee finde
in the 40. verse of that Chapter and so notwithstanding that it remaines a truth that the doctrine of Paul and of the other Apostles of Christ is heauenly and simply to be beleeued, and obeied as the doctrine of Iesus Christ. This may strengthen vs against the poison of all other  doctrines either contrary or differing from the doctrine of the Apostles and teach vs to hold them within com∣passe of the Apostles owne censure of Anathema.The eachers of the Church of Rome can shew no war∣rant for their calling. Gal. 1.8.9. If any man or Angell preach otherwise &c. hold and adiudge him accursed; and let this arme vs against all the deuised doctrines of the Church of Rome, for let that Church proue vnto vs that their teachers haue apostolicall power and authority the same that the Apostles of Christ had and the infallible assistance of the spirit of Christ in that they teach differing from the doctrine of the Apostles and then we shall haue some reason to condescend to their opinions and to receiue their vnwritten traditions; but if that be a priuiledge and prerogatiue belonging only to the Apostles the planters and first founders of the Church of the new Testament, and not descending and passing by succession to any other (as indeed it is) surely then we can∣not hold their ordinances and traditions being (at the least) diuers from the constitutions of the Apostles any other thing then meere inuentions of their owne braines.  But they reply and plead for themselues that their tradi∣tions and ordinances are not to be taxed as meere inuen∣tions of men, because they are not ordained by meere humane power, but by Christ his warrant and authority by such as are placed ouer his Church of whom Christ saith,Luk. 10.16. He that heareth you heareth me so that their traditions and ordinances are not appointed by meere humane po∣wer, but by the holy Ghost ioyning with their teachers in the regiment of the faithfull. A faire colour and gilding set vpon a rotten post. To answer them and their allegation (He that heareth you,  heareth me &c.) it is true indeed that he that heareth
the Apostles and such as follow them in the office of tea∣ching, the pastors and teachers of the new testament hea∣reth Christ, but how? surely so long as they teach nothing but that Christ hath taught. Christ hath not assured vs that whosoeuer heareth men (though calld to teach) hea∣reth him simply whatsoeuer men teach; but so long as men preach Gods word, and doctrine thence grounded, and that appeares,Ioh 14 26. the comforter (saith Christ) which is the holy Ghost, there Christ promiseth that his spirit shall suggest and bring all things to the minds of his Apostles and their followers which he had taught them, not any new doctrines or reuelations; they then that speake any thing of their owne contrary or diuerse from the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles in the new testament, falsly pretend the holy Ghost, and let the Church of Rome set what glosse soeuer they can vpon their vnwritten traditi∣ons, they cannot free them from being found meere hu∣mane inuentions, and their worship built vpon them, vn∣reasonable and foolish, for deuised worship must needs taste of the vessell whence it came, the braine of man, full of ignorance and folly in matters concerning God and  his worship. As we are to auoide doctrine contrary and dissenting from the doctrine of the Apostles and to hold it accursed so are we to yeeld reuerence faith and obedi∣ence to the doctrine of the Apostle Paul and to whatsoe∣uer is taught agreeable to the same,All reuerence is due to the doctrine of the true mi∣nisters of the Gospell. as to the doctrine of Iesus Christ, as if Christ should speake immediatly from heauen, for the ministers of the Gospell being the Am∣bassadors of Christ and speaking in his stead as we haue it,2. Cor. 5.20. and being faithfull and deliuering nothing but the re∣uealed will of Christ are to be heard as their Lord and master Christ Iesus whose messengers and Ambassadors, they are. Quest.  It is not the letter but the sence and mea∣ning of the holy Ghost in the writings of the Apostles that is to be heard and receiued, as the doctrine of Christ now as S. Peter hath told vs:2. Eph. 3 16. in the Epistles of Paul somethings
are hard, &c. and there is difference of expositions of the writings of the Apostles: How then shall we that are vn∣learned know what doctrine is agreeable to the true mea∣ning of the holy Ghost, in the writings of the Apostles? I answer  first in generall as one doth in a like case vnto the Papists, obiecting that the scripture is hard and therefore to be kept from the vulgar and common sort; though ma∣ny things in the Epistles of Paul be hard yet the way and meanes to come to the true vnderstanding of them is to read and heare them diligently, to marke them attentiuely,Note. to pray heartily and to iudge humbly. But for more speci∣all direction to know what doctrine concluded out of the writings of Paul is agreeable to the meaning of the holy Ghost in the same, we must remember two things which by diligent reading and carefull obseruation any one may easily find in the writings of the Apostle. First that the whole teaching of the Apostle doth run vpon Christ his whole doctrine,1. Cor. 3.11. as a structure or house is built on Christ the foundation as himselfe speaketh, no man more aduan∣ced the glory of Christ, euincing and proouing iustificati∣on and saluation in and by him alone, and none more withstood such as preached the law or intermingled the law with the Gospell in the matter of iustification then he did, we preach Christ &c. and Chap. 2.2. I esteemed,1. Cor. 1.24. &c. and many like sentences we find in his Epistles he runs almost in euery line vpon the name of Christ and the ad∣uancement of his glory. The second thing to be remem∣bred is that in the doctrine of the Apostle concerning the worship and seruice of God, which we are to performe in way of thankfulnesse for his mercy,Rom. 12.1. the Apostle doth vrge vpon vs inward holinesse and spirituall worship and ser∣uice. I beseech you, &c. and in this Epistle he much con∣demnes externall worship and worshipping of Angells and commends vnto vs inward holinesse and spirituall wor∣ship. By these two generall things remembred we may ea∣sily discerne who expound the writings of the Apostle a∣right
and deriue doctrine from thence consonant to the meaning of the holy Ghost, (namely) they, who with the apostle preach Christ with all due respect of his glory in the worke of redemption and saluation, and without any impeachment or derogation from him in regard of his kingly, priestly, or Propheticall office, they that teach Christ in all things to haue the preheminence as it is vers. 18. of this Chapter, and propound spirituall worship and seruice of God standing in mortification of the flesh and newnesse of life, and that these are essentiall notes of true doctrine we find them laid before vs by S. Iohn in his first Epistle the fourth, in the triall of spirits in discerning the spirit of truth from the spirit of error, he teacheth that the doctrine is good and of God that is founded on Iesus Christ incarnate, and holds the truth of his incarnation. And secondly that propoundeth spirituall worship of God for saith he verse 5. false teachers and Antichristian spirits are of the world and speake of the world, they are earthly and carnall they teach a plausible and pleasing worship fit∣ting the folly and corruption of mans nature, consisting in bodily exercises rites and ceremonies, things of great estimation and admiration in the world; on the contrary the teachers and spirits that are of God, euen in outward actions of religion require inward heauenly and spirituall worship of God agreeable to the will and nature of God standing in true faith of the heart, true contrition of the soule and other fruits of Gods spirit. By these two notes, namely preaching Iesus Christ incarnate with all due re∣spect of the honor of his name as e only king, Priest, and Prophet of his Church, and by propounding spirituall worship of God we may easily discouer the exposition and doctrine concluded from the writings of the Apostle, which is most agreeable to the meaning of the holy Ghost in these writings and hauing found the truth we are to cleaue vnto it, and to yeeld reuerence, faith and obedience to it as to the doctrine of Iesus Christ. So much touching
the description of Paul by his office.The descrip∣tion of him from the effi∣cient cause of his office. Note. Now to the efficient cause of it in the words following, (By the will of God;) we are to marke that the Apostle in setting down the efficient and first true cause of his Apostleship, excludeth his owne will, that he was called, to be an Apostle and sent to preach the Gospell not by his owne will, but by the will of God. He had no such will or disposition, in himselfe, no doubt he was vnwilling, but the Lord who in his eternall councell had appointed him to that office in his good time by his grace called him and of vnwilling made him willing, and euen then when he was a bloudy persecuter, the Lords will  was effectuall to make him a famous preacher.God brings his purpose to passe for the good of his children of∣tentimes when they are most auerse and repug∣nant. Exod. 4.13. See then how the Lord brings his purpose to passe for the good of those that belong to him, in their aduancement to some good place and calling euen then, when they themselues are most auerse, vnwilling, repugnant and vtterly against it. We read when Moses shewed himselfe most backward, pleaded excuse and entreated the Lord to send some other then the Lords will was effectuall to aduance him to that honor to be the messenger to Pharaoh to deliuer Israel to haue the leading and gouernment of a mighty people. We find the like of Ieremie the Prophet in the first Chap∣ter of his prophecie, and when Ionah the Prophet flatly re∣fused to go to Niniueh, & as he thought fled from Niniueh, then the Lord ouerruled him and aduanced him to be a meanes of the repentance of that City, as we read in the prophecie of Ionah. Vse. Doth the Lord by the effectuall  working of his will call and aduance men to some place and calling,Strength to our faith that the Lord will assist vs in our lawfull cal∣lings. euen then when they are carried in a contrary course. Let this then in the first place strengthen our faith in his prouidence and goodnesse, that when we are called and set in any lawfull calling and goe on with good con∣science in that calling, the Lord will assist vs and helpe our infirmities. For doth the Lord call to any seruice and not giue strength to performe it? yes doubtlesse though we find our infirmities still resting vpon vs, yet if we hold on a
constant course in that calling we shall find supply of strength. The Lord could (if it had so pleased him) haue made Moses eloquent but he did not, that his glory might more appeare, yet he was with his mouth and taught him what to say as he promised.Exod. 4.12. Moses found continuall aide and assistance and supply of his want from the Lord, and thus shall they that goe on with good conscience in a law∣full  calling. Againe doth the Lord many times dispose them that belong to him,Gods proui∣dence wat∣cheth ouer his children when they full little thinke of it. to a place and dignity cleane contrary to their meaning, will, purpose, and course of life formerly held? then let all Gods children learne for their comfort that Gods prouidence watcheth ouer them for their good, when they full little thinke of it, full little did Paul thinke when he breathed out threatnings and slaugh∣ter against the Church of Christ that he should haue been a preacher of his Gospell, but that good wil and prouidence of God ouer his, euer waketh and neuer sleepeth, though they sleep, and neuer thinke of any such thing, nay please themselues in a contrary course, yet his prouidence is working for their comfort, health, life, aduancement vnto honor, &c. doe not many naturall things make this a cleare point and preach thus much vnto vs? growes not the grasse and corne when we sleepe, and the best hearbs for our health and vse? Come not sweet shewers when wee sleepe that make husbandmen reioyce and sing? and ma∣ny other things make it manifest that the good prouidence of God watcheth ouer his children for their good when they full little thinke of it;Hest 6. excellent is that story of Mor∣decai to this purpose. We there find that king Ahashuerosh when he could not sleep commanded the Chronicles to be read before him and finding there the loyalty of Mordecai that he had discouered a treason intended against him & yet had no honor nor dignity giuē him for that discouery, the king presently thought how and which way was fit to honor him and it was concluded by the aduice of Ha∣man (who thought that the honor intended would haue
light vpon himselfe) that Mordecai should be apparrelled with royall apparrell &c. as followeth in the Chapter. Poor Mordecai no doubt was a sleepe when this was concluded, and little thought of any such matter, but the good proui∣dence of a gratious God that neuer sleepeth sent this com∣fortable mercy to his child for his honor and for the good of the whole Church by his aduancement. Oh then let this and the like examples teach vs that Gods prouidence watcheth ouer vs for good when we little thinke of it, and that our good God purposeth to as many as be his chil∣dren, such good as we can hardly imagine and let vs neuer fall from this God by distrustfull feare, that so careth and prouideth for his when they are asleepe, and when they runne on in a contrary course. We are further to marke that Paul riseth vp and ascendeth from his calling to the will of God, that he was now called to be an Apostle and being called he knew the Lord had before in his will and purpose appointed him to that office, for he knew not this but by the euent: whence ariseth this doctrine that  the will of God is signified and reuealed vnto vs either by the scripture the written word of God,Gods will re∣uealed either by scripture or by particu∣lar euents. or by particular euents, by the issues and falling out of things good or euil, for it is certaine that nothing comes to passe but by the will and prouidence of God, if it were otherwise the Lord were not almighty, which is not to be imagined, when therefore anything is come to passe Gods will is therein reuealed. For example when a mans house is burnt and his goods consumed then Gods will and pleasure is reuealed touching the losse of such things as Iob said.Iob 1.21. The Lord hath taken because the Lords will was manifested in the losse of his goods. Obiect.  Is Gods will reuealed in the euent of things good and euill, then God willeth euill? Answ.  Euill is twofold, of punishment, and of sinne. The first God wil∣leth and is the authour of it, for punishment being a worke of iustice against sinnne, is good, is willed, and wrought
by God.Isa. 45.7. Amos. 3.6. But for the euill of sinne we must consider a dif∣ference betweene sinne it selfe and the euent of sinne, or comming to passe of sinne, the first of these is euill, and the other good in respect of the end, to which it is by God di∣sposed, namely his glory in the manifestation of his iustice and mercy. Now God willeth not sinne it selfe, but the e∣uent or comming to passe of sinne, but how? not by effe∣cting it, but by withholding his grace from the creature, and not hindering it when he might if he would and so ex consequenti, God willeth the euent of sinne he not hinde∣ring it willingly permits it to be done for a good end, euen his glory, for the manifestation of his iustice and mercy. Vse.  Would we then know Gods will both for matter of faith and fact,Knowledge of Gods will for faith. Fact is from the word of God, and of particular good and euill by the euents. both things to bee knowen beleeued and practised, looke then into the word of God. Would we againe know his will concerning particular good or e∣uill, to come vpon the outward estate of our selues or o∣thers, then tarry we the time the Lord hath appointed to discouer and make it knowen vnto vs by euent. It is ex∣ceeding rash and hasty boldnesse in some, who dare goe about to search the will of God in things to come, by the helpe of wizards, witches and diabolicall meanes, yea a thing more frequent and common, and as wicked and damnable it is, that some many times gather arguments of life or death, of good or euill successe vpon their acti∣ons and businesse, by the flying or crying of birds, by blee∣ding of the nose, burning of the eare, falling of salt, by dreaming &c. This is a great abuse and profanation of the workes of Gods prouidence, the Lord hath not appointed these things to manifest his will in things to come to bee ominous or to portend good or euill, and to obserue them to that end, is a superstitious deuice of men seduced by Satan,Note. without any Christian or naturall reason. The Lord sometimes suffers the euent to answer the foolish obserua∣tion of such as giue heed to these things in iudgement be∣cause they giue heed vnto them,Deut. 14. and by that meanes the
Deuill steales out of their hearts that assured trust in the prouidence of God, which is the chiefe stay of true belee∣uers amidst the troubles and disorders of this world, and so, as the Preacher saith, as the fishes are taken in an euill net,Eccles. 9.12. and as the birds are caught in the snare, so are they snared in the euill time when it falles vpon them suddenly, they know not which way to turne themselues and to winde out of that trouble, nor whereto finde comfort, remember wee what wee finde to feare God aright,Deut. 28. and truly and then blessed shall wee be at home, abroad, in towne, in field, in basket, in dough, in sheep, in kine, &c. And contrariwise, cursed for want of religion and the feare of God, for that is reuea∣led to be the cause of Gods curse, not because the Rauen flew ouer the house, &c. Now further, Paul making the will of God the efficient and first cause of his Apostleship, that being an outward state and condition of life, this ge∣nerall conclusion followeth: from hence that the will and  prouidence of God doth appeare,Gods proui∣dence is to be seene in the distinction of men into se∣uerall callings and is to be seene in the distinction of men into seuerall callings, in ranging men into seuerall orders and degrees, disposing some to be A∣postles, some Rulers and Magistrates, &c. For howsoeuer it seemes to be against nature; that whereas all men are of one nature, sprung of one originall, alike subiect to death, there should bee so great inequalitie amongst them, yet heerein shines forth the wonderfull prouidence of God, who out of so sundry orders and degrees of men doth ga∣ther a sweet harmony and agreement, for the maintaining of he fellowship and society of mankinde, without which it could not stand, for one could not endure and beare an∣other, there would range many outrages, vnlesse men were held in with the bridle of some greater authoritie and po∣wer, yea more then this, the prouidence of God doth cleer∣ly shew it selfe, euen in the confusions and disorders that be amongst men distinguished into seuerall callings, when in the place where there should be Iustice, there is worme∣wood, and in the place of Iudgement wickednesse, yet
therein appeares the prouidence of God, who doth wisely order and dispose things so disordered and intangled to a very good end, namely, the preseruation of the societie of mankinde: for it is a true position, better a tyranny then an Anarchy; better to endure tyrannicall oppressing Magi∣strates, then to haue none at all: for that state where there is no publike power at all, but euery man may doe what seemes good in his owne eies, in stead of one tyrant makes many. Heerein then appeares the prouidence of God, by disposing men into different degrees & callings, though they be corrupt and disordered in their places, yet the Lord by his infinite wisedome doth order and dispose them to a good end. This may settle and stay our mindes from wonder and amazement, when we see many corruptions and disorders in men of placeA stay to our mindes when we see disor∣ders in men of place. and authoritie, when iustice and equitie is bought and sold as though the Lord did not regard: for certainly the Lords eie is ouer them in time to bring them to iudgement, and in the meane season as an excellent worke-master, who of crooked and vntoward matter frames an excellent worke, doth dispose them to the pre∣seruation of societie, and in that to the good of his Church.Eccle. 4.7. It is the vse the Preacher makes; If in a Countrey thou seest, &c. be not astonied, &c. stand not as it were at a bay in a carefull and combersome cogitation, as if God did not see or regard; for questionlesse he that is on high, wat∣cheth and wardeth ouer the highest, in due time to punish offendors, and disposeth of things confused and out of or∣der, contrary to the nature of them, to a very good end. Againe, a second thing that may hence be concluded, is this:Euery mans place and portion in this world is appointed by the will of God. as Paul had his Apostleship by the will of God, so euery mans place and portion in this world is appointed vnto him by the will of God; euery mans condition, whe∣ther high or low, rich or poore, publike or priuate, is allot∣ted vnto him by the good pleasure of God; for his will and prouidence guiding and gouerning all other things, wee
may not seclude and shut it out from hauing stroake in the conditions of men; no certainly, it is a generall aphorisme and sentence of Scripture, that the Lord maketh poore and maketh rich, bringeth low and exalteth, and euery man hath his portion at his appointment: he made Ioseph Gouernour of Aegypt, and hee made Lazarus lie begging at the rich mans gate: euery one hath his lot and conditi∣on, not by hap or chance, but according to the ordinance and appointment of the Lord. This doctrine ought to worke in euery Christian heart patience and peace,  to be contented with the estate we en∣ioy,Content∣ment with the estate we enioy. whatsoeuer it is: for as the common prouerbe is beg∣gers must be no choosers, and we are all beggers in respect of him who hath the rule and disposition of all things.Note. Haue I then little? it is the will of God I should haue but little, and I ought to be contented. Haue I more? it is more mercy, requiring more thankfulnesse, thankfull for the one, and thankfull for the other, and euer contented with Gods will. And to that end wee are to consider, first, that the calling and condition we are in being appointed of the Lord, is the best state and condition for vs, if we be Gods children: for he willing our eternall good, must needs will that is best fitting our seruice of him in this transitorie pas∣sage. Secondly, we are to consider what a clog and hinde∣rance to good duies discontentment is: they who are dis∣contented with their state can neuer do their duty in their place and calling, their minds are happled and enthralled.1. Tim. 6.9. Lastly, consider that the outward blessings and good things being no sure signes of Gods fauour, if wee be not content with them, it makes it plaine, that we are not in his fauour, though we abound in outward good things: for to his children with the things themselues hee giues quietnes and contentment, wealth without woe, store without sore, and as we vse to say, it is the speech of Salomon,Psal 2.27.2. Pro  2 Discontent∣ment is left to godlesse persons, who are ignorant of Gods proui∣dence, so then let these things stirre vs vp to quietnesse and
contentation, our dwelling heere or there is by the proui∣dence of God, in a faire house or a foule: our condition of life, be it a rich trade or a poore, is by his appointment; wheresoeuer or howsoeuer, it is aboue our merit or desert, we therefore ought to be pleased and thankfull. Now in that Paul ioines Timothie a brother to himselfe in the writing of this Epistle,Paul and Ti∣mothie ioined together. hee did it no doubt both to shew that hee wrote no priuate opinion of his owne, but such things as had consent of other true teachers of the Gospel, and also the better to mooue the Colossians to receiue his  doctrine: whence we may gather, that consent in true do∣ctrine is an excellent thing,Consent in true doctrine is an excellent thing. & much to be regarded; when teachers meet together in one truth, as Paul and Timothie did, it is a thing of great vse and consequence; for besides this, that it doth free the teachers from the note and ble∣mish of lightnesse and newfangled giddinesse, and that they teach not opinions of priuate fancie,2. Cor. 1.17. 1. Cor. 14.32. as Paul rea∣sons for himselfe, and prooues himselfe to be free from lightnesse, it shewes that they follow the rule of the Apo∣stle Besides this, it is of excellent vse in respect of the hea∣rers, who if they be vnbeleeuers, not yet brought to the faith, are thereby mooued to faith and obedience, as the Apostle saith,1. Cor. 14.24. if all iointly prophesie, &c hee is rebuked of all, &c. which argues consent of those that rebuke, and then marke what followeth, he will fall downe on his face, and confesse that God is in the teachers, and so be moued to beleeue. If the hearers be such as already beleeue, then consent of teachers is a speciall inducement to constancie and perseuerance, and serues much for the further buil∣ding of them vp in faith and holy duties. As in the raising vp a materiall building, ioint labour of many hands rids much worke, when mens hands worke together ioint∣ly and cheerefully, then the building goes well forward, so in the spirituall building of the Church, it must needs be a notable furtherance of the worke of that building, when the builders take paines together with consent and good
agreement. This we are to contend for, by earnest and har∣ty  praier,We are to pray for good consent a∣mong tea∣chers. for certainly the diuell doth hinder the building of Gods Church by nothing more then by difference and dissentions amongst the builders. And seeing that by Gods mercy we haue in our Church consent in substance of doctrine necessary to saluation, this ought to moue vs to constancy and continuance, and not to be like chil∣dren as the Apostle speakes, wauering and carried about with euery winde of doctrine by the deceipt and craftines of seducing Popish inchanters, for though they buzze into  the eares of the simple (thereby to seat themselues vpon their consciences,Consent in substance of doctrine in this Church ought to work in vs constancy.) that there is great difference and dissent amongst vs, and a maruellous consent among them of their Church, yet they that are able to iudge aright, see and perceiue the cleane contrary, that we by Gods mercy differ not in matter of substance but of circumstance, and their owne writers of speciall note auouch as much, Morton Apo∣logia, Cathol. pag. 304. &c. seeing then all of sanctified iudge∣ment amongst vs, and some of our aduersaries (trueth brea∣king out of their mouthes) confesse that we differ not in matter of substance, let not difference for matter of cir∣cumstance make vs begin to be cold and backsliding in matter of substance, no doubt the end the diuell driues at in our differences is Atheisme or Papisme, and he hath attai∣ned his end in too many, let vs striue to disappoint him of his purpose, and to that end we are often to thinke on the argument of the Apostle. That if we follow factions, some hold of one and some of another,1. Cor. 1.13. we shall be brought to that exigent that we must either confesse Christ to be di∣uided (a thing impossible) or our selues to be no members of Christ and that we are carnall.Cor. 3.3.4. So much of the first verse. VERS. 2. To them which are at Colosse, &c. First, touching the parties to whom this Epistle was
written, not to say any thing of the place of the City of Colosse but to speake of the titles,The parties written vnto in this second verse. and Epithites heere giuen to the Colossians (Saints, & Faithfull) the meaning of the Apostle in giuing these titles vnto them is this, that he held them such as were clensed by the blood of Christ from their sinnes, and had some measure of inward holi∣nesse wrought in them, and that they were such as profes∣sed the faith of Christ and were the adopted sons of God in him, and brethren and fellow heires of life eternall. It is first to be marked that the Apostle writes not to noble men, nor to rich men, no, nor to poore men, not to any order, sort, degree or condition of men apart, but to all ge∣nerally at Colosse of what calling or state soeuer, stiling them with these titles (Saints, & Faithfull, &c.) the lesson hence is this that religion (as one saith) knowes not ou  persons, our outward callings and conditions, not that re∣ligion doth not admit distinction of order and degrees of calling,Religion knowes not our outward callings and conditions. for therein the prouidence of God appeares as be∣fore was shewed, but it respects not the outward states, and callings of men in propounding and applying the do∣ctrine of grace and saluation. All in Christ of what calling state or degree soeuer are holy beleeuing brethren as the Apostle saith.Gal. 3.28. There is neither Iew, &c. all are one in Christ Iesus there is no difference nor inequality of them that be in Christ in respect of iustification and adoption;  why a but will some say this seems contrary to that,Reuel. 22.11. where the holy Ghost saith he that is righteous, &c. or more righte∣ous, if there be some increase of righteousnesse and iusti∣fication; then there are different degrees and inequality. Ans. The righteousnesse there spoken of is inherent wrought in them that are iustified which is a fruit of their iustification in Christ; of that there may be increase? some haue a greater measure of grace and sanctification then others, and accordingly shall haue a greater degree of glo∣ry in heauen. But that righteousnesse by which a man is iust in the sight of God is not increased, for that is perfect
in Christ; and admits no increase; they that are in him are equally iust in the sight of God as one saith well, he that truly beleeueth in Christ, is as iust as he that hath fulfilled the whole law; he that beleeues in Christ hath the perfe∣ction of the law and so cannot haue any increase, it is then cleare that there is no difference nor inequality of them that are iustified and the adopted sons of God in Christ. This is full of sweet comfort to all such as beleeue in Christ though they be base and of low degree in the world, yet this doctrine tells them that they are the deare saints of God and in the sight of God equall and fellowes to the greatest, in respect of iustification and adoption. Let this comfort and incourage thee in euery good way. It is  commonly seen and one may easily obserue it,Comfort for godly poore professors. that many such as are poore and not like to rise in this world as their state seems most desperate in the eie of the world and in  their owne opinion, so they giue themselues ouer to a des∣perate and lewed kind of life, to carelesse behauiour,For carelesse irreligious poore pro∣fessors. to drunkennesse, to swearing, to railing, &c. and why? they foolishly thinke that as they are on the ground and can fall no lower, so they cannot rise or be in better estate then they are, and therefore care not what they speake or doe, nor what men thinke or speake of them; on that they wold but remember, that if they be in Christ though of meane condition in the world, yet they are equall and matchable to the best and greatest brethren, to the most noble, and to kings and princes, no doubt the consideration and com∣fort of this, setled and wrought in their hearts, would raise vp their minds to better thoughts they would then thinke thus with themselues, though we be poore wretches and of meane condition and despised in the world, yet this is a great and singular comfort vnto vs, that we being in Christ, are as highly in Gods fauour as the best, we are as pretious vnto him as the apple of his owne eie, we haue title to his heauenly treasures (which are) better then all the riches and treasures in the world.
We haue the word of reconciliation the couen  grace, and the broad seales of his kingdome belong vnto vs, this is our comfort, and this comfort will  suffer the consideration of our poore estate to carry vs to do any thing vnworthy of this so excellent a condition.  men thus reason, they are poore and therefore will be ca¦lesse in their carriage, then certainly as yet they haue  part in this comfort and sweet consolation, that they  ¦quall to the best in iustification and adoption; they  themselues equall in deed, but to whom? to saints fahf &c. no, but to bruit beasts, as we read of Nebuchadne that by sauage distraction was changed into the dispositio of a bruit beast, for it is apparant to themselues that  are inferior to other men in outward condition end  scripture maketh it plaine that by disobedience to  man doth degenerate from his kind and becomes lik  bruit beast that perisheth.Psal. 49 20. Luk 13.32. Mark. 8.33. Nay like Satan, for which ca our Sauiour calleth Herod a Fox. And Peter one of his o disciples, Satan. Let then all poore despised ones i th world comfort themselues in this, that in Christ they  equall to the best in respect of iustification and adop and withall remember to rise vp from this comfort to a li beseeming such as are iustified and adopted. Now further in that the Apostles calls the Colossia brethren in Christ,All in Christ haue faith like pretious to the Apostles faith. a title signifying not only loue bu equality, we may conclude that all in Christ haue fai like pretious to the Apostles faith, such a faith as ma them brethren to the Apostles, yea if we be in Christ o faith saueth vs as truly and as certainly as the Apos faith saued them. Peter makes it cleare. Simon Peter, &▪ And S. Iohn.2. Epist. 1.1. 1. Epist. 1.2.3. The life appeared, that is Iesus Christ that  might also haue fellowship, &c. by faith in Iesus Chr we haue fellowship with the Apostles, yea with God the ¦ther and with his sonne Iesus Christ. If then we haue like pretious faith with the Apostles, i by our faith we haue fellowship with them, yea with God
himselfe, it must needs follow that they erre greatly who teach that the Apostles might be sure of saluation, but not other christians, that the Apostle might say, I am perswa∣ded, &c. but we may not say so,Rom. 8.38. Therfore o∣ther christians may be sure of their salua∣tion as well as any of the Apostles. 1. Epist. 5.13. and that this is false and er∣ronious, marke but that one sentence of S. Iohn these things I write to you, &c. S. Iohn writes to all Christians that they may know they haue eternall life, now knowledge as all define it, is a determination or fastning of the mind to one part with a certainty. If Christians then may know they haue eternall life, they may be setled, they may fasten their heart and soule to it with a certainty, so S. Paul speakes of himselfe and all other beleeuing Christians. We know,2 Cor. 5.1. The salutati∣on of the par∣ties written vnto. &c. eternall in the heauens, and what is that but euerlasting life, so much of the parties. Now to the salutation in the words following. Grace, &c. Wherin the Apostle wisheth & praieth for two things to be giuen, Grace and peace, both from God the fountain of grace and peace, and from him not as an absolute God but as our father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ the mediator, by whom all good things come vnto vs; here then in this sa∣lutation two generall things are to be stood vpon.Interpreta∣tion. First the things wished and praied for (grace and peace) secondly, from whom they descend and come vnto vs. For the first, touching the fence and meaning of the words, we find in scripture a twofold acception of the word. (Grace) it sig∣nifieth either the free and gratious fauour of God where∣by he doth accept and is well pleased with his chosen in and for Christ, giuing them remission of sinnes iustificati∣on, adoption, &c. or grace giuen, the gift of grace wrought in vs by his spirit, in both these acceptions we find the word vsed in one and the same sentence. Now here we are to vnderstand it in the first signification only,Rom. 5.15. as signifying the gratious fauour of God; whereby he doth imbrace his chosen,Rom. 5.1. and the word peace doth comprehend both in∣ward peace, tranquility of mind and conscience spoken of, and outward peace with the creature, as Angels and men,
yea with the beasts and stones as it is,Iob. 5.23. and outward welfare, prosperity and good successe, for so we read, Ioseph asked his brethren of their peace,Gen. 43.27. or as the word is translated of their prosperity. When therfore the Apostle wisheth grace and peace to the Colossians, it is as much as if he had said, I wish you the free and gratious fauour of God in Christ Iesus, and likewise quietnesse of conscience in respect of Gods fauour, and outward peace with all the creatures, yea good successe and prosperity in all things. Hence first we are to marke that the Apostle in his wish and praier for good to the Colossians, giues the first place to the grace and fauour of God, wishing them first grace, then peace.  Hence our lesson is this; that the grace and fauour of God is the chiefest good thing of vs to be desired and sought after.The grace of God is the chiefest good thing to be sought after. It is the doctrine of our Sauiour, first seeke, &c. Dauid praied thus, Lord lift vp, &c. as if he had said, therein is my chiefe ioy and comfort, yea I find more true ioy and com∣fort in that, then in the increase of wheat and wine. The Apostle saith he counted all things,Mat. 6.33. Psal. 6.7. &c. that he might be found in Christ, and so in the fauour of God, and there be many reasons why we should thus esteeme and be of the  Apostles mind, for why? the grace and fauour of God is proper and peculiar to his children. Riches and outward  things of this life are common to them with the wicked. Againe the grace and fauour of God makes the outward things of this life truly comfortable and blessings vnto vs, without which they are nothing but accursed vanities and vexation of spirit, as the Preacher speakes. And let vs com∣pare the grace and fauour of God with the grace and fauor  of the world, euen the greatest fauour of the highest in the world, the grace and fauour of the world the most it can doe, is but to enrich or aduance vs, giuing vs leaue to enioy good things and possessions; in affliction and in the hower of death it cannot helpe nor deliuer vs from affliction) from despaire and death, but the fauour of God in the midst of trouble, sorrow, perplexity, and in the conflicts of consci∣ence,
giues comfort and consolation, yea it worketh such rest and reioycing of heart as all the goods in the world cannot yeeld. A man vpon his death bed galled with a guilty conscience would giue all the world (if it were his) for the least dram of that comfort Gods children find in the apprehension of Gods fauour. These things may serue not only to make knowne and to proue the truth of this, that Gods grace and fauour is most excellent, but also to affect and stir vp our Christian soules to breath and seeke after it aboue all things in the world, and let the considera∣tion of the excellency of Gods fauour in Christ stir vs vp to spend both time and strength, not after the manner of the world, in hunting after riches and pleasures, but that we may find some assurance of Gods fauour towards vs, and to this end carefully vse we the meanes appointed both to beget in vs faith in the blood of Christ, whereby we may be assured of it, as hearing, reading, meditating in the word of God with praier, and also to ratifie & confirm; the same, as a frequent and a reuerent vse of the sacra∣ments. In the second place in that the Apostle ioines these two  together (grace and peace) we are taught.Where there is assurance of Gods fauour there is peace of conscience and contrari∣wise. Where there is assurance of the grace and fauour of God there is peace of conscience, where is no assurance nor perswasion of grace, there is no peace of conscience, then being &c. the Apo∣stle makes peace towards God, that is peace of conscience, the fruit of iustification by faith, that when by faith we are assured of the remission of sinnes and Gods fauour, then wee shall haue peace of conscience. The reason and ground of this is, because Gods fauour in Christ doth dis∣burden the conscience of that thing that sets God and the conscience at difference and enmity, and makes it accuse in the sight of God, namely the guilt and burden of sinne, and that being remooued by grace, and the conscience thereof perswaded, it must needes then bee quiet and at peace with God & excuse & comfort in the sight of God.
Let this be thought on first by all ignorant & impeni∣tent persons,Therefore ig∣norant and impenitent persons haue no true peace of conscience let them know they haue no true peace of conscience, because that springs and growes out of this root, a certaine knowledge and assurance of grace which cannot stand either with affected ignorance or hard hear∣ted impenitency; they may haue a drowsinesse or a sence∣lesnesse of conscience, as it is in benummed and seared consciences: but they neither seeing their sinne nor fee∣ling the sting of conscience cannot haue true peace of conscience, the feeling of sinne alwayes Gods giuing be∣fore that. Again is there no peace of conscience where there is no assurance of grace,Therefore nothing in vs by the grace and merit of it, can pacifie the consci∣ence in the sight of God. because grace onely doth release from sinne and so quiet the conscience, then how is it possible that any thing in vs by the dignity and merit of it should pacifie and settle the conscience in the sight of God? how can it be as the Church of Rome teacheth, that any good∣nesse or righteousnesse inherent in vs should of it selfe breed true peace of conscience, it is impossible that the conscience should be quiet and ioifull vnlesse it haue peace through grace. For admit this (which can neuer be proo∣ued) yet gtant this, that a man could aspire and come to a perfect measure of loue to God, euen perfect in measure and degree according to the exact rule of the law of God, yet could not that perfect loue procure remission of any one forepassed sinne, perfect loue in degree by the condi∣tion of the couenant of workes doe this and thou shalt liue, can onely bring the recompence and reward of life, it cannot both procure life and also satisfie for sins past; that is no part of Gods promise annexed to his couenant of workes, he sayth not, doe this and thou shalt liue, and if thou faile in doing this and breake my Law, thou shalt by other good deedes done satisfie for that breach, no, the condition of perfect obedience in the morall Law propounded, once broken, there can be no compensation nor expiation but by punishment either in the person
offending or some other in his stead, it is without question that the actiue obedience of Christ was most exact, hee in his life fulfilled the whole Law of God, yet was not that legall meritorious & most perfect obedience of his suffici∣ent to procure remission of sins for then he died in vain, he must ouer and besides that suffer death, euen the cursed death of the crosse, and beare in his body and soule the extremity of Gods wrath before hee could satisfie Gods iustice for the sinnes of his chosen,1. Pet. 2.24. therefore it is sayd hee bare our sinnes &c. wee may then safely conclude against the Papists that it is not loue nor any other thing in vs (ad∣mit it to bee most perfect) that can satisfie the Iustice of God, and so settle, the conscience, onely the assurance of grace and of the fauour of God in Christ can doe it. Now in that the Apostle wisheth peace to the Colossi∣ans  vnder that title,We may law∣fully and it is our duty to pray for the peace of the Church. vnderstanding not only inward peace as hath beene declared, but outward prosperity, wee are taught that we may lawfully, yea our duety is to pray for the peace and prosperity of the Church. Wee shall finde through the tenour of the whole Scripture, that if Gods children found comfort or reioycing in good things and blessings of God temporall or eternall, their care hath been to vse all good meanes for the continuance of them, as Dauid finding true ioy in beholding the prosperity of Ie∣rusalem,Psal. 12.6.7. stirreth vp himselfe and others to pray for the con∣tinuae of it. Reasons why we should so doe are, first be∣cause we shall be therein like God himselfe, who is sayd to reioyce in doing good to his Church. Secondly, we shall thereby testifie our communion with the Church, that we are members of it, and haue a fellow-feeling both of the good and of the afflictions of the Church, but a more spe∣ciall conclusion following also from hence is this,We may also pray for tem∣porall good things, in par∣ticular. Iam. 5.14. that as the Apostle prayed for peace, so it is lawfull for vs to pray for temporall good things in particular for health, liberty, peace, plenty, fruitfull seasons, &c. is any sicke &c. where wee see the elders of the Church sent for, are to pray for
the health of the sicke, by proportion wee may call vpon God for other temporall blessings, examples are many to this purpose. Moses prayed for victory against the Amale∣kites,Exod. 17.11. Gen. 17.18. Rom. 1.10. Abraham that Israel might liue, and was heard, Paul for a prosperous iourny. The ground of this is the pro∣mise of God, who hath promised to preserue his Church and Children in this life, and to supply their necessarie wants, and what he hath promised we may lawfully pray for, Gods promise is the ground of prayer; against this some take exception,Exception. and say, we know not whether tem∣porall good things will be good or hurtfull vnto vs. Ther∣fore we are to leaue them to be giuen at the pleasure of the Lord.  Answer, In prayer wee are not to regard our owne knowledge of the successe and euent of temporall good things wee pray for, but referre that to the wisedome of God who knowes what is good for vs, and if hee see them good, will grant them vnto vs, if not will with hold them. Therefore notwithstanding this, it remaines a truth that wee may lawfully pray for temporall things, and that wee may haue more speciall direction in this point,Two needfull cautions. because it is to be vnderstood with some caution of necessity to bee obserued in the practise of it: seeke we no further then the words of the Apostle in this place, where wee haue these two cautions offered to be thought on; first that wee pray  for them in the second place. First pray for grace then for peace and prosperity, first of all if we want pardon  sinne and be not reconciled to God, wee haue no right to tem∣porall good things. God may say vnto vs when wee aske them at his hands, as Christ says to the woman in the Go∣spell, it is not meet to take the childrens bread and giue it  vnto whelps. Secondly, that we pray for grace with them, that we neuer pray for any temporall blessing alone, but for the blessing of God vpon it, for grace with it, to vse it well to Gods glory and our comfort &c. for as wholesome and good meat taken into a corrupt stomacke feedes bad humours, and breakes out into vlcers and sores, so tempo∣rall
good things receiued of wicked and gracelesse per∣sons, giue nourishment to sinfull lusts of the heart, which breake out in pride, in wantonnesse, in riot, and in many disorders. The vse  of this is thus much that seeing it is lawfull to pray for temporall good things,We are ther∣fore to take of the guilti∣nesse of an euill consci∣ence in com∣ming by tem∣porall things. so as we pray for grace in the first place, and for grace with them that we may vse them well, let vs take heed we set not a barre be∣tween our selues and praier for a blessing vpon the tempo∣rall good things we inioy, that is the guiltinesse of consci∣ence in ill getting of them. For can a theefe pray ouer his booty that God would blesse it? he cannot, no more can we pray for grace and the blessing of God vpon our tem∣porall good things if our consciences tel vs we haue gotten them ill. And so much of the things wished and praied for by the Apostle, &c.The foun∣taine from whēce things wished for do descend. Let vs come to see from whence they descend, and first they are said to come from God the fountaine of all goodnesse, and from him as a father. For the right vnderstanding of the words, we must know that by the word father is principally vnderstood the first per∣son in the trinity, yet so as in heart and mind we must con∣ceiue the Son and the holy Ghost. For it is a rule in diuinity that the word (father) is taken personally and by it meant the first person in the Trinity,The word father taken two waies personally and essentially. when one person is confered with another, as vet. 3. but when it standeth in relation to vs it is taken essentially & to be vnderstood of the father, Son and holy Ghost, subsisting in the same Godhead and diuine nature.Note. Here by the way we may see how silly a shift it is that is vsed by the Papists to elude and put of our argu∣ment from this word father against inuocation of saints, for when we reason thus (Christ hath taught vs to call on God the father only, therefore not on Angell or Saint) they reply, this concludes not, for if this stand good, Christ hath taught vs to call vpon God the father, and therefore not vpon Angels and Saints, then this likewise is a good inference therefore not vpon God the Son, nor vpon God the holy Ghost, the rule deliuered ouerthrowes this excep∣tion,
for in calling on God our father we call vpon God the father son and holy Ghost.God is our father three waies and in what sence he is called our father. Luk. 3.38. Gal. 4.5.6. 1. Pet. 1.23. But for the better clearing of these words we are to know that God is our father, three waies. First in regard of creation, so Adam is called the son of God. Secondly by adoption in Christ, thirdly in regard of sanctification and regeneration by the word and spirit. We are borne anew, &c. and so made sons of God by, &c. in this place we are to vnderstand the Apostle not in the first re∣spect, but in the second and third, that he praied for grace and peace, not from God our father by creation, but by adoption and regeneration: for as we are Gods creatures only, and haue no other priuiledge, we dare not aproach his presence hauing defaced his image, and by sin fallen from our first estate of creation. The words thus vnder∣stood  do affoord a double instruction one of comfort, and another of duty.For comfort we may de∣pend vpon God with full assurance seeing he is our gratious father in Christ. For the first in that God is our father in Christ, hereupon all that be in Christ are taught to repose their whole trust and assiance of their hearts in him, to de∣pend wholly on him for grace and mercy, and all good things. For why? he is God all-sufficient able to command heauen and earth, to serue for our good. And he is God our father willing to do vs good, yea such a father as cannot grow out of kind, and leaue of to be kind, and tenderly affected towards his children,Isay 49.15. he can as soone cease to be God (which is impossible) as forget to doe good to his sons  and daughters. Can a woman. &c. though she could, yet &c. saith the Lord to Zion.We are not to doubt of Gods proui∣dence in the time of need. Away then with all doubting of the good prouidence of God in the time of need, if wee which are euill yet in the nature of fathers prouide good things for our children, how much more shall our heauen∣ly father prouide for the good of his children, it is our Sa∣uiours argument,Mat. 7.11. and let not reason stand against it, god is our father who hath giuen his owne deare son to die for vs to make vs his children,Rom. 8 32. how then shall he not with him, &c. that is the argument of the Apostle. Let me ioine to these a third argument, God made himselfe knowne to be
our gratious and prouident father, before we could know much lesse acknowledge our selues to be his children, he formed vs in the wombe, he brought vs out in due time into the world, he prouided milke in the breasts, nourish∣ment and all things needfull for vs, yea more, he entred into couenant with vs (with as many of vs as be in Christ) to be our God and father, and we to be his children for euer, he signed and sealed this couenant by the sacrament of baptisme the solemne seale of our adoption to be his sons and daugthers, all these he did before we knew what was done vnto vs, and will he now forget to prouide good for vs, when we know and acknowledge him, and by faith depend vpon him? it is not possible, let then the comfort of this raise is vp to an assured trust at all times in the pro∣uidence of God our good and gratious father. Againe, se∣condly  is God our Father,For comfort. God cannot see vs to be long in trou∣ble seeing he is our merci∣full father. are we his adopted sonnes and daughters in Christ, then let vs know for our further com∣fort that the Lord cannot long behold our miseries and afflictions, without pitty and compassion, our sighes, our groanes, our sobs of sorrow, and teares of repentance in time of trouble and distresse, cannot long be vnrespected of the Lord, as a man of tender bowels cannot looke vpon his child humbled, and vpon his knees, and weeping before him, but be mooued to pitty and towards him, much lesse can the Lord being the father and fountaine of all com∣passion and mercy. And to giue further strength to this comfort see and consider a notable patheticall speech of the Lord,Hosea 11.8.9. where the Lord makes as it were a demurre and pause vpon the matter, when he was to execute his iudge∣ment on his people, and faith, how shall I giue thee vp on Ephraim, &c. could euer father speake more compassio∣nately ouer his child, when he is about to beat him? surely no tongue can expresse the pitty and tender compassion of the Lord; now if the Lord haue such a melting heart towards his poore people, that when the rod is vp, and he is ready to strike, he holds his hand of himselfe breaking
out into these speeches, how should I doe it? my heart i turned vp and downe in me, oh then what force haue o sighes and groanes before him in time of our distresse. If we be his children how do our teares of vnfained repen∣tance flowing from a grieued heart, moue the Lord to pit∣ty? can he continue to strike vs holding vp our hands for mercy, looking vpon him with watry eies, humbled in the dust before him, and for Christ his sake begging pardon of sinne, crauing ease, comfort, and reliefe. No, no, be assu∣red of it, he is our father, a kind, a louing, a good and ten∣der father, he seeing our trouble and hearing our groanes, will be mooued to pitty, and not faile in due time to send comfort either of strength or deliuerance, let this comfort and cheare vp the hearts of all the sonnes and daughters of God in Christ. Now further in that God is our father,  this must teach vs to carry the affection of children, loue reuerence,For duty. feare, humility, and obedience towards him. If we call him father,1. Pet. 1.17. &c. as often as we open our mouths and call God our father, so often euen of our owne mouthe the Lord shall iudge vs.We must car∣ry the affecti∣on of chil∣dren towards God seeing he is our fa∣ther. If we neither liue nor desire to liue in the obedience of his children; as we take comfort in God to be our father, so we must also carry our selues as he may take pleasure in vs to be his children, or else the word fa∣ther in the mouth and no duty of sonnes in the life makes God of a Father a Iudge vnto vs, and turnes his fauour into fury, his pitty into plagues, punishments, and iudgements against vs, yea our owne mouthes shall testifie against vs, and of them he will iudge and condemne vs. Let vs then take this profit by it, that God is our Father, euen to re∣forme vs daily as the Lord shall giue grace and strength in∣to the obedience of children, and so much of the first au∣thor and giuer of grace and peace in these words from God our father.Grace and peace come from our Lord Iesus Christ imme∣diately. Now touching the last words of this verse, the Apostle sayth, grace and peace come from the Lord Iesus Christ, that is immediately, for grace and peace come from God the Fa∣ther
as from the fountain, but by the mediation of Christ, and it is to bee marked that the Apostle cals Christ (the Lord) in generall, not in restraining the word (Lord) as standing in relation to his members as in the next verse. Now Christ is called (the Lord) as hauing full power ouer all things as being Lord of life and death, of Heauen, Hell and of all creatures in heauen and earth, so wee read, this power Christ hath not onely as he is God,Act. 3.15. Act. 2, 36. & 5.31. equall to his Fa∣ther, but as man also by the donation and gift of his Fa∣ther, more shall bee spoken of this title in the next verse. Now in that Christ our Sauiour is Lord of life and glory,  and giuer of grace, peace, repentance,Christ is God coeternall & coequall with his Father. and remission of sinnes, we may hence conclude that hee is God coeternall with his Father, and coequall to his Father, and this is cleere in many places of the Scripture, and by his miracu∣lous workes, manifesting diuine power, and by the honor and diuine worship giuen vnto him both by men and Angels.  And the consideration of this ought to strengthen the faith of as many as beleeue in Christ,This serueth strongly to strengthen our faith con∣cerning the sufficiency of the redempti∣on rewroght by Christ. teaching them that by the merit of his death apprehended by faith, they haue grace and peace, full remission of sinnes and perfect redemptiom from eternall death and damnation, and so making them to rest wholly on his death, as a perfect satis∣faction to God for their sinnes, for why? Christ our IESVS who was content to shed his bloud for vs, was not onely man but God, and all the workes of God are perfect, there∣fore we need not seeke for grace & peace, satisfaction & re∣mission of sins any where but in Christ. The works of pen∣nance which the Popish sort hold able to satisfie for sinnes, which they foolishly terme veniall, doe mightily derogate from this one, full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice of Christ once suffered vpon the Crosse, for which one offering hath he consummated &c.Heb. 10.14. Christ who suffered was both God and man, vnited into one person, and by vertue of his God-head,Act. 20.28. he gaue power to his death to be meritori∣ous and of infinite price and value, the Church is sayd to
bee  od not  suffer or shed  Christ ffered dely as  vnion Christ being God and man in one person, it is sayd that God shed his bloud, noting and giuing vs to vnder∣stand for our comfort, the infinite merit and sufficiency of his death, that the person suffering, being not meete man but God also, his death was a sufficient satisfaction for our sinnes. VER. 3. We giue thankes to God, &c. In this verse, the Apostle beginnes the preface to his whole Epistle,The begin∣ning of the preface to the whole Epistle. and continues it to the twelfth verse, and it stands vpon a congratulation and a prayer. The congra∣tulation from this third verse to the ninth, the prayer in the verses following. The generall exposition of the Apostles congratulati∣on & prayer.The words of this third verse, containe the generall pro∣position both of the Apostles congratulation and prayer, that he and Timothy did congratulate and reioice and pray for the Colossians, his congratulation is expressed by the manner of it, namely, a giuing thankes to God, who is heere described by relation to Christ (we giue thankes &c.) his prayer is set out by the time (alwayes) that whensoeuer hee prayed, hee was mindefull of them, and prayed for them: these are the generall things contained in this verse, wherein we are to marke that the Apostle expressing his congratulation or reioycing, by giuing thankes for good things, that thankesgiuing fals into prayer, he beginnes in thankesgiuing and he ends in prayer; his thankesgiuing begets and brings foorth prayer: The point hence arising is this. That one grace well vsed brings forth another, as there is a combination of sinnes,One grace well vsed brings foorth another. one sinne neuer goes alone but begets and brings forth another; so is on grace attending vpon another, and is linked and lapped within another,
where grace is well vsed it will encrease, the things of this world, the more they are vsed the more they are worne, but it is contrary in the graces of the spirit of God, one of them begets and brings forth another,Rom. 5.4. as the Apostle saith patience &c. we may obserue it in our selues, that as many as haue hearts opened as Lidia had,Act. 16.14. to attend to the word preached, that attending with care brings vs to vnderstand the word, vnderstanding and knowledge vsed begets faith and good affection, those being stirred vp and exercised, bring foorth a proportionable measure of obedience and practise, where the grace of attention and meditation is is not vsed, it makes many good lessons fall as seede vpon the pauement, and makes men ignorant of some principall things wherein they haue often beene instructed;  this ought to teach men to make much of the least measure of grace,We must make much of the least measure of grace. Mat. 25.29. let them cherish it and vse it, and it will increase as our Sauiour hath promised to him &c. And not to goe from the particular heere offered, if men congratulate and reioyce with others for good things found in them, or vse to reioyce for good things bestowed on themselues tem∣porall or spitituall, giuing thankes to God for the same, that reioycing of theirs going vp to Heauen in thankes to God; from him will be sent downe further grace, euen the grace of prayer and calling vpon God, and from thence further feeling and comfort in those good things. Secondly, in that the Apostle gaue thankes and made  prayer to God onely,Religious in∣uocation be∣longs only to God. we are taught that religious inuoca∣tion standing in petition, and thankesgiuing belongs only to God, and this may be confirmed, besides many testi∣monies of Scripture, by many reasons viz. the very in∣stinct of nature teacheth, whom we make our God, him to pray vnto; though the Heathen had many gods, and so did not call on the true God, yet they thought none was to be called vpon but a God; they alwaies call on him or them, whom they accompted gods,Iona. 1.5. the mariners being heathen Idolaters cried euery man to his god, so that to
whom prayer belongs, hee is God by opinion of the Heathen, yea the bruite creatures in their kinde call on God &c. he giueth food &c. in many verses Dauid exci∣teth all creatures to praise the Lord.Psal. 147.9. Psal. 148. Secondly, Inuocati∣on is a sacrifice of the New Testament foretold;Mal. 1.11. Heb. 13.15. hence gi∣uing of thankes is called a sacrifice. Now all sacrifices are to be offered to God only.Exod. 22.20. Act. 14 14. He that offereth &c. Barnabas and Paul rent their clothes &c. when the people of Lystra would haue sacrificed vnto them. Thirdly, bee able to heare, vnderstand and helpe them that pray vnto him, yea he must haue knowledge of their hearts, because prayer is sometime,Exod. 14 15. Suspirium cordis, but a sigh of the heart. Wher∣fore criest thou, sayth the Lord to Moses, yet hee spake neuer a word.1. Sam 1.13. Act. 1.24. Hannah spake in her heart &c. but God on∣ly knoweth the hearts, therefore to God onely must pray∣er be made. Last of all, Inuocation and Faith must al∣wayes goe together, it is the argument of the Apostle. How shall they call &c.Rom. 10.14. Now we must beleeue only in God therefore to him only must we pray,  this point being thus cleered and prooued,Confutation of inuocation of Angels & Saints. it meeteth with the opinion of the Papists, who hold and labour to maintaine inuocation of Angels and Saints departed, that opinion cannot stand with this truth of God: but they endeauor to vphold their opinion by this reason; say they it is lawfull to call vpon men liuing heere vpon the earth, while wee liue together we may request one anothers prayers as Paul did, therfore it is lawfull to call on Saints departed, for say they, if it be not lawfull,Rom. 15 30. then is it for one of these causes, either because they will not heare vs, but (say they) that is not so, because now they haue greater loue vnto vs; then when they were on the earth: or because they know not what we pray for, but that also is not so, because look how the Angels know the conuersion of a sinner and reioyce, so the Saints depar∣ted know it, or lastly, because iniury is done to God or to Christ, but this is otherwise, for then wee might not re∣quest men liuing to pray for vs.
This argument hath many branches. First I answer to it in generall, that the consequent is naught, we may re∣quest the liuing to pray for vs, therefore we may pray to Saints departed, because for the first we haue both precept and promise, for the other neither. Againe, touching their proofes first it is true, Saints departed haue greater loue, for loue continueth for euer.1. Cor. 13.8. Yet the loue of Saints depar∣ted is nothing else but a constant vnchangeable and conti∣nuall desire, whereby they wish eternall happinesse and sal∣uation to the whole Church of God, and to all the faith∣full, and that the kingdome of Christ might be perfected in all his members, thus we may grant that Saints in hea∣uen doe pray for vs that is, they wish well to the whole mi∣litant Church, and to all the members equally and indiffe∣rently, but to say they pray for one and not for another, cannot be granted, because it is contrary to that loue they beare equally to all, and further they are exempt from that feeling of our particular miseries, which they had on the earth, because that would detract from their perfect ioy and glory, therefore we may not conclude from their loue, that they pray for any one in particular. Secondly, where∣as they say, as the Angells know the conuersion of a sinner so the saints departed know it. We answer, there is not the same reason why the saints departed should know it as the Angells doe; because the Angells are appointed ministring spirits and know many particulars which happen vnto vs,Heb. 1.14. and many of our priuate necessities, but the Saints do not, being alwaies absent, and yet worship, and consequently inuocation of Angels is forbidden in the second Chapter of this Epistle and eighteenth verse, therefore much more of Saints they neither knowing nor hearing our prayers Ob. God reueales to them what is praied for; we answer againe, this appeares not by any place of scripture. Second∣ly, to what end should we pray vnto them if they know not what we aske but by reuelation (and to the last thing they alledge we answer. That it doth derogate from Gods glory
and from the perfect mediation of Christ to call on Saints departed, whereas they except. Then to request the liuing to pray for vs, we answer as before, the case is not alike. First because we haue both precept and promise for the one and not for the other. Secondly, we make not the liuing mediators, as they doe Saints departed, but only request their mutuall praiers to commend our suites to Christ our head; they hauing a fellow feeling of our wants, as we haue of theirs, and so as members together, we send vp our mutuall praiers vnto God, and exercise our charity one towards another, and so notwithstanding this cauilling of the Papists it still remaines a firme truth that inuocation and prayer belongs only to God. Now to the Apostles description of God to whom he gaue thanks and praied; God is here described by rela∣tion to Christ, that he is the father of Christ our Lord and Sauiour,God is the father of Christ as he is God, and as he is man. the word (father) here standing in relation to Christ is taken personally as before we noted, and that we may rightly conceiue how God is the father of Christ, Christ being both God and man, we must know that God is the father of Christ in respect of his deity, by nature, be∣cause he is of the same eternall essence with the father, begotten from all eternity, and so the only begotten sonne of God,Ioh. 3.16. and in respect of his humanity, not because he had substance of body and soule from the substance of his fa∣ther, but because as man he was conceiued by the worke of the holy Ghost, and by personall vnion his humanity is assumed and doth subsist in his deity,Luk 1.35. the word was made flesh, and thus God is the father of Christ. Ioh. 1.14.We are further to marke that God is the father of our Lord Iesus Christ,How we are to conceiue of Christ in respect of Gods chosen. whereby the Apostle giues vs to vnder∣stand how we are to conceiue of Christ in respect of Gods chosen, as that he is their sauiour and their Lord, not only as he is Lord ouer all creatures, but in more speciall man∣ner, and that in a double respect, first in respect of freee do∣nation from his father,Ioh. 17.9. secondly in respect of his worke
of redemption. Ye are not your owne, for yee, &c. and so much may serue for the meaning of the words.1 Cor. 6.19.20 Now we are to mark that the Apostle gaue thanks and sent vp prai∣ers to God, not as he is an absolute God, but as he is the father of Christ, and in him a father to all that belong to Christ. And this is the Apostles ordinary forme of praier and thanksgiuing in the beginning almost of euery Epi¦stle: Our lesson hence is this, that our praiers to God must in like manner be offered vp in the name and mediation  of Christ only. There is one God, and as there is one God,Praiers must bee offered vp to God in the mediation of Christ onely. so one mediator, in his name only must we come to Gods throne. How the Papists do cauil on this place it is known, say they Christ is the only mediator of redemption, but the saints are mediators of intercession, this distinction is most foolish, it makes the body not answer to the shadow, nor the trueth correspondent to the figures, for the high priest in time of the law was in figure a mediator both of expiation by sacrifices, & of intercession by praiers,1 Tim. 2.5. & did shadow and shew, that in time of the new testament both these things should be conioyned and meete together in Christ: again, it doth rob Christ of a great part of his honor belonging to his Priesthood, for Christ hath not onely by his owne sufficient sacrifice, consecrated, but sits also at the right hand of his Father, to make request for them.Heb. 10.14. Rom 8.32. Heb. 7.24.25. Christ his Priesthood is euerlasting, therefore his intercession is perpetuall, it is the Apostles reason, and to this wee may ioyne other reasons. First; we by reason of sinne, & because of our vnworthinesse are all chased from the throne of God, and wee are not able to stand before the throne of glory, till it be changed into a throne of grace, he therfore that is our mediator and intercessor to goe betweene God and vs, must bee able to take away sinne and to procure righteousnesse, life, and the fauour of God. Christ onely is able to do these things, therfore in his name onely must we offer vp our prayers. Againe, he must be our mediator, in whose name we haue promise to be heard:Ioh. 14.13.14. but in Christ
onely this promise is made, Whatsoeuer ye shall aske, &c. Rom. 8.26.Obiect.  We read the spirit it selfe maketh request. and ver. 27. the spirit maketh request for the Saints, therefore Christ is not our mediator onely. The answer is easie, if we obserue the words, and rightly vnderstand them. For when the Apostle saith, the spirit maketh request for vs with groanes, we may not take it that the Holy Ghost is subiect vnto griefe or passion, but that he doth breath into the hearts of the faithfull, such moti∣ons whereby they do earnestly cry vnto God, he maketh or teacheth them to pray with most vehement desires, sighes, and groanings: or hence is he said to make request for them as we heare it;Reu. 22.17. The Spirit and the bride say (come) not that the holy ghost doth pray for the comming of Christ, but because he enflameth the Church with a vehe∣ment desire of his comming: so it remaines a trueth, that Christ only is our mediator and intercessor between God and vs. To passe ouer the opinion of the Papists. First of all our meditation vpon this point ought to be to this purpose,In praier to God we must be far from a conceipt of a∣ny worthines in our selues. are we to come to God in praier, in the name and medita∣tiō of Christ alone? must we hope to be heard & respected of the Lord onely in, and for his beloued son Christ Iesus, then it ought to be far from vs, when we come to God in prayers to be lift vp in any the least conceit of any worthi∣nes in our selues though we be regenerate, and though we be the children of God and such as feare God, yet must we not thinke to be heard for our faith, and for our feare of God, if we doe, we come not in the mediation of Christ, for to come in his name & mediation is not only in word to call on God through Iesus Christ, and to conclude our prayers with these words commonly vsed at the shutting vp of prayer (through Iesus Christ our Lord) but to offer vp our praiers in the merit of his death the price of our re∣demption, and that cannot stand with any the least confi∣dence in any thing in our selues.  Againe, we comming in
confidence of some thing in our selues, we come to a God cloathed with iustice and iudgement, ready to powre out his wrath vpon vs; happily some will say, may wee not in our praiers stand vpon it, and pleade it in the sight of God that we are his seruants and children: did not Dauid thus.Psalm. 86.2. 2. King. 20.3. Did not Hezechiah thus frame his praier. I beseech thee O Lord remember, &c. hath not God promised to heare and and accept the praiers of his children? Ans. Dauid and Hezekiah in the places cited,  did not plead the merit of their righteousnesse, but onely testifie that they were the children of God regenerate, and such men as to whom God hath promised to be good and gra∣tious, they did onely assure themselues that Gods promise of helpe and deliuerance pertained to them in particular, because they were of that number. For as we haue it, the eies of the Lord are vpon, &c. Thus far as many as truly feare God,Psal. 34.15. may vse the benefit of a good conscience and their owne integritie, to confirme them in the promises of God made to his children, their consciences bearing witnesse that they are such as truely feare God, they may hereupon comfort themselues with assurance that their praiers are precious to the Lord. That is the vse of the feare of God in the time of praier, we are not to plead to bee heard for the feare of God, but to assure our hearts by it to bee ac∣cepted in, and through Christ. Again, the consideration of this may comfort vs against  a fiery dart of the Deuill,Comfort a∣gainst a fiery dart of satan. wherewith he many times trou∣bles the weake, namely this, that they are vnworthy, vile, and wretched, the deuill will goe about to perswade them, that they are so vnworthy as they may not pray to God, nor expect any fauour from him, in this case the weake Christian may comfort himselfe, and raise vp his heart, and beat backe the assault of Satan with this, that he comes to God not in his own name, nor any other name, but in the name of Christ, and in him his vnworthinesse is couered; in and by him, the throne of glory and Iustice is changed
into a throne of grace, and therefore we are not to be dri∣uen away from God, in regard of our vnworthinesse, but to be truely humbled for it, and to bewaile it, and in hum∣ble confession of it to come to God, who hath promised to haue respect in Christ to such as are of broken and con∣trite hearts. In this description (Father of our Lord, &c.)  the Apostle further teacheth vs how we are to conceiue of Christ;They that ac∣knowledge Christ their Iesus, must al∣so acknow∣ledge him their Lord. Mat. 11.29. the point of instruction is this, that as many as acknowledge Christ their Iesus, must also acknowledge him their Lord, that is the right faith in Christ, we hold it an Article of our faith, wee are taught as much by Christ himselfe, that such as come to him by faith, and find com∣fort in him, must take his yoke on them, how then doe they deceiue themselues, and feed vpon a fancy, who will haue Christ to beare the burden of their sins, and yet ne∣uer submit their neckes to beare his yoke,  a Redeemer they will haue him, but not a Lord,They deceiue themselues, who will haue Christ a Re∣deemer but not a Lord. they will haue a por∣tion in his redemption, but their owne lusts must be their Lords, they will be saued by grace, and yet liue the life of nature, follow after drunkennesse and all manner of pro∣phanesse, as they are led by the lusts of their owne hearts, let such know that they are bewitched with a strong delu∣sion of the Deuill, they set vp a Christ of their owne fra∣ming, and beleeue not in Christ propounded and set forth in the Gospell, for let them thinke on it with reason, can they imagin that they hold Christ their Lord, whom they daily despite and crucifie, I think they are not so fond and foolish. Now this they doe by their sinnes, who continue hardened and vnrepentant in their sinnes, therefore it is said, one day they shall see him whom they haue pierced, if men hold not Christ a Lord,Reuel. 1.7. they cannot hold him a Sa∣uiour, for these two are conioined. If euer then we would find comfort in Christ, we must learne to make him our Lord, and suffer him to rule in our heart and liues. Now to the last words of this verse, wherein the Apostle sets it downe in generall, that hee praied afterward, expressing
the particular matter of his praiers, and hee settes it not downe barely, that he praied, but together with it, the time (alwaies) that is to say, euer when he called vpon God for himselfe he ceased not to pray for them, as he saith vers. 9 not to say any thing of the time heere mentioned, we shall speake of it more fitly, cap. 4.2. The point hence to be ob∣serued is this. In that the Apostle praied for the Colossi∣ans for whom hee gaue thankes, by his example wee are taught that we are to lift vp our praiers to God, euen then when wee haue cause to praise God, when wee haue iust  cause to giue thankes to God for good things in our selues or others, euen then are we also to bee humbled in praier,When wee pray to God we haue also iust cause to praise him, and so on the contrary. for why? besides this that there is no man, who hath such measure of gifts and good things, but that so long as he is in this world hee hath his wants, and is to pray for a supply for them; besides this, praier is a speciall meanes sanctified and appointed of the Lord, to procure and to bring downe his blessing on good things for the continu∣ance and increase of them: yea such a meanes, as by it o∣ther meanes, which must not be neglected, receiue a bles∣sing from the Lord, good meanes seruing for the continu∣ance of good things vnto vs, vsed without praier are commonly crossed and cursed, because the Lord cannot away to be made a seruant to flesh and bloud, but being vsed with praier they are blessed and they prosper. There∣fore praier must reach as farre as any matter of thankesgi∣uing, what things soeuer doe minister matter of praise and thankesgiuing to the Lord, the same giues vs iust cause of praier for a blessing vpon them, and wee must take know∣ledge of this duty, and labour to practise it. In the time of want men will fall on their knees,  and cal on the Lord,Men are wan¦ting in the practise of this dutie. Hos. 5.15. Exod. 5.1. with some men, want is more forcible to make them pray, then the commandement of God, the commandement came to Pharaoh, let my people goe that they, &c. but he in his ruffe and prosperity answered, who is the Lord, yet afterward when hee was plagued, and his
stomacke beaten downe with an iron rod, hee confessed the Lord,Exod. 10.17. and desired Moses and Aaron to pray for him. Thus many in time of sickenesse, trouble and distresse will pray vnto the Lord, but in time of health and plentie, in time of abundance, they are hardly drawne to this duty, nay, then they say vnto God, as we haue it, depart from vs &c. men many times promise vnto themselues a perpetui∣ty in their goods,Iob. 21.14.15 as the rich man did, but wee know the answer of God vnto him,Luk. 12.19. thou foole, &c. and take we heede we deserue not the same title, would we haue sure and cer∣taine hould of good things, then pray we for the continu∣ance of them, let our praier reach as farre as we haue mat∣ter and cause of thanksgiuing, euen then when Gods bles∣sing is on our Tabernacles,Iob. 29.6. as Iob speaketh, when wee wash, &c. when wee haue the blessings of God in abundance, then are we to bee humbled in praier, and because we are commonly carelesse of this duty in time of prosperity, know we, that if we lift vp our hands and voices in praier onely, when we are vnder the hand of God, that praier is a praier of nature, not of grace: for nature teacheth the bruit beast to groane vnder the burden, when we are pin∣ched then nature teacheth vs to cry for helpe, it is not a praier of grace, and the free spirit of God, and such praier, may stand and goe hand in hand, with wilfull rebellion against God, the Lord saith, his people in time of a great dearth assembled themselues for corne and wine, and yet they rebelled against him,Hos. 7.14. if then we would haue our praier a free will-offering, and so pleasing vnto God as a sweet fruit of his owne spirit, and a testimony of our free obedience, we must be carried to a quicke and ready performance of it, e∣uen then when we haue matter of praise and thanksgiuing Now come we to the fourth verse. Wherein are laide  before vs the things, for which the Apostle gaue thanks in the behalfe of the Colossians,The things for which the Apostle gaue thankes. namely, their faith and loue with the proper obiect of them both, of their faith, Christ Iesus, of their loue, the Saints, and that generally towards
all the Saints, and this matter of thankesgiuing is further amplified by the time that since &c. that is the summe and substance of the verse; wherein first obserue we the things for which the Apostle gaue thankes, and those were not things of the world, outward things; but things spirituall,  when this conclusion followeth,Our thankes∣giuing to God in the behalfe of our friends must be espe∣cially for spi∣rituall good things in thē Heb. 6.9. 2. Cor. 7. that our reioycing and giuing of thanks to God in the behalfe of our friends, such as we are bound to tender and more entirely to respect must especially be for spirituall things in them, for things pertaining to Gods Kingdome, and such as accompany their saluatiō, as the holy Ghost speaketh, see we the Apo∣stles reioycing in this kind in liuely colours, he there saith hee was filled with comfort, when hee heard by Titus of their mourning, their feruent desire, their godly sorrow and the fruits of that, his ioy and reioycing was altogether for the graces of Gods spirit in them; his example ought to be our rule, wee are chiefly to reioyce for spirituall good things found in our friends, and the reason of this is; not onely for the excellency of these good things, beeing of their owne nature more excellent then outward good things, but because other good things are by them sweet∣ned, and made truely comfortable to our friends, and without them, all other things are but so many waights to waigh downe their condemnation to make it more heauy and intollerable, vnto them, we are therfore to giue thanks to God, especially for spiritual good things in our friends. Now this is contrary to the course and custome of the world, it is amongst men vsuall in token of their loue,  to giue thankes to god for the health, the wealth,The course & custom of the world repro∣ued. the frugali∣ty and thrift of their children and frinds, but few or none for their faith, loue, repentance, humility and other spiri∣tuall gifts and graces, this argues wee sauour the things of the flesh, and not the things of the spirit, for as many as are regenerate and children of God, as they finde sweet∣nesse and comfort in spiritual graces in themselues, so they delight to see them in others: and againe they follow the
rule of the Apostle, in all things they giue thanks to God, euen in euery creature, they find out some thing wheerby they are stirred vp to magnifie the power, wisedome, and goodnesse of God, much more doe they find such matter of reioycing and thankesgiuing to God in the renued i∣mage of God appearing in their friends, in their holinesse, their feare of God, their faith, their loue, &c. If then wee find that wee can reioyce and giue thanks to God for out∣ward things, and not for spirituall graces, it is a strong proofe that our harts are not yet seasoned with grace, and the consideration of this ought to stir vs vp to the practise  of this duty. Come we to a second thing, and that is this in that these two,Faith in Christ for remission of sinnes euer brings forth some measure of loue both to God and men. faith and loue are conioyned, we are taught that faith in Christ for the remission of sinnes can∣not but bring foorth some measure of loue both to God and all that beare Gods image, for though true sanctified loue be not as the Popish learning teacheth, the forme of true faith, nor concurring as a cause in the act of iustifica∣tion, yet is there a necessary concurrence and concomi∣tancy of faith and loue in the person iustified, true faith pleasing to God and auaileable to saluation,Gal. 5.6. is euer fruit∣full and worketh by loue in life and conuersation, and wee may safely say it is as possible that the sun should haue no light, the fire not burne, or the reasonable soule (which is immortall) not liue, as that true faith and assurance of Gods mercy in Christ should not be fruitfull in thankful∣nesse, in obedience, and in many good duties of loue both to God and man.Note. Indeed loue and holy obedience may be di∣uorced from that faith which the Papists teach to be true catholicke faith, that being but a bare assent to the truth of the history, and such as may be in diuells, can brng foorth nothing but trembling, or at the most admiration and a∣mazement, as at the sight of some Pageant or strange won∣der, but that faith which hath the right seale and soule of a iustifying and comfortable faith, that is an affiance and trust in Gods mercy in Christ, for the remission of sinnes
and all other appendant blessings, temporall and eternall cannot but send forth loue and many good fruits worthy amendment of life, it is then (for the vse of this) a sophism, a deceipt of the flesh forced vpon men,  by the strong de∣lusion of the diuell, to thinke they haue faith in Christ,It is a deceit of the flesh to thinke that true faith in Christ may be seuered from true loue to men. and yet haue not the least dram of Christian loue to their bre∣thren, this is to thinke that faith in Christ for remission of sinnes and many sinnes may dwell together, which is a thing impossible, they that thus think, neuer felt the pow∣er of Gods mercy in Christ; and they are yet in their sins whose hearts are possessed with such deceiuing thoughts,2. Pet. 1.9. we must know it for a truth from the mouth of the Apo∣stle. He that doth not ioyne to his faith vertue, &c. hee is blind and he hath forgotten that he was purged, &c. doth he not remember nor thinke on the power or the blood of Christ, which is able not only to wash away the guilt and punishment of sinne, but to purge out the corruption of sinne, if we haue a right faith in Christ, if we haue a right apprehension of the bloud of Christ, it will certainly make our hearts pliable and obedient to God, and tender, louing and sincerely affected towards men. Can we thinke that any mans heart is washed in the blood of Christ, and yet it remaineth full of the poison of sinne? no certainly, neuer was any heart bathed in the blood of Christ but thereby it was suppled and made tenderly affected towards all the Saints and members of Christ. Therefore let no man de∣ceiue himselfe in this point. Now to the obiect of faith and loue, and first of faith (Christ Iesus) where in a word  marke we the phrase vsed by the Apostle, he saith not they beleeued Christ but in Christ,We neuer find in scrip∣ture mention of faith and trust in any but in Christ and in God. Exception. a phrase euer in scripture v∣sed to expresse true faith and affiance standing in relation to Christ and to God, we shall neuer find mention of faith affiance, and trust in any, but in Christ and in God. This I note to shew the strength of our argument, against inuoca∣tion of Angells and Saints. Where we reason with the A∣postle,
that we cannot call on them because we may not beleeue in them.Exception. Exod. 14.31. Now against this, exception is made by our aduersaries the Papists. No say they? may we not be∣leeue in men? why? what say you to that, they feared, &c. Againe,Rom. 10.14. doe we not read in the Epistle to Philemon, the fift verse, the Apostle saith he heard of his loue & faith, &c be∣hold say they, the Scripture teacheth faith in Moses, & faith in the Saints.Answ. 2 Chro. 20.20 We answer in that place of Exo. the words are not in God &c. but they beleeued God, that is, they gaue credit to the Lord and to Moses his seruant, they gaue cre∣dit vnto the word he had spoken vnto them, ver. 13.14. and so their owne translation hath it crediderunt Domino & Mosi &c. and cannot otherwise be expressed in Greeke or Latine, as their own vulgar interpreter hath well obserued. The like place we haue, heare ye me O Iuda, and ye inha∣bitants &c, beleeue his Prophets, that is, giue credit to the words of his Prophets &c. for the second place we answer, that any man who is not wilfully blinde, may see that faith is there referred to Christ, and loue to the Saints: againe, the Apostle speakes of the Saints liuing not departed as appeares ver. 7. therefore that place cannot make for Po∣pish faith and beliefe in Saints departed, neither can they finde any place of Scripture so much as by implication, teaching faith or trust and affiance in men bee they neuer so good, but rather the contrary, the Lord hath set a curse on that man that trusteth in men.Ier. 17.5. Now further touching  the obiect of that faith that is here signified.True iustify∣ing faith is fixed and bounded on Christ Iesus onely. Faith, trust & affiance, the obiect of it is sayd to be Christ Iesus, whence we may gather that true iustifying faith is fixed and boun∣ded on Christ Iesus only, though faith in a generall signifi∣cation being a word of relation, respecting things to be be∣leeued, haue reference to the whole word of God, & haue for the materiall obiect of it, euery truth recorded in the word, yet as it is an instrument of iustification, it beholdeth the speciall mercy of God in Christ: it apprehendeth Christ and his merits, the merit of his innocency, the me∣rit
of the holy and perfect obedience of his life, the infinit merit of his satisfactory death, & hence it is called the faith of Iesus, & this is to be marked, because in this respect on∣ly is faith sayd to iustifie,Rom. 3.26. faith doth not iustifie as a quality inherent in vs, for any excellency or merit in it selfe, nor any action of faith of it selfe, but onely by relation to the obiect, because it taketh hold of the merit of Christ, and doth apprehend and applie his perfect righteousnesse vnto vs, as the hand receiuing gold or siluer giuen, makes not rich, nor the worke of the hand in the act of receiuing by it selfe, but the gold or the siluer. So it is not faith nor the worke of faith that doth iustifie, but Christ, whom by faith we apprehend, the matter of our iustification as the Apo∣stle hath taught vs, God hath made him to bee sinne,2. Cor. 5.21. and this being so it must teach vs. First, to take heede of the doctrine of the Church of  Rome, who say faith doth iustifie indeed, but how?Confutation of the Papists touching the manner how faith doth iustifie. not by relation to Christ the obiect of it, but as an excellent ver∣tue bringing foorth many diuine and gracious motions in our hearts, as the feare of hell, loue of God, a considerati∣on and a desire of life eternall, and so fitting and preparing vs, and making vs worthy ex congruo to receiue grace and iustification, a doctrine diuelish and dangerous, flat con∣trary to the truth now deliuered, and contrary to that op∣position made by the Apostle, where hee opposeth belee∣uing and working, faith and workes, therefore faith as a worke or excellent vertue doth not iustifie,Rom. 3.27.28. for then the A∣postles opposition is ouerthrowen, then beleeuing and working might stand together, which are made opposite  and cannot in the act of iustification stand together.Such as will be iustified in Gods sight and saued e∣ternally, must renounce all things in themselues. Againe (for the second vse) if faith doe not iustifie as an excellent quality, for any excellency or merit in it selfe, but onely by relation to the obiect of it Christ Iesus, then as many as will (indeed) be iustified in the sight of God, and eternally saued, must learne vtterly to renounce all things in themselues, and there is good reason for it, for if
other qualities and workes, bee so farre foorth good, as as they come from faith, and faith it selfe, as a quality or worke doth not iustifie vs in the sight of God, then much lesse can any other grace or worke do it; it is the pride of our corrupt nature to look for iustification, & saluation by some thing in our selues, if wee liue in ciuill fashion in the world, and we hurt none &c. then wee are lift vp in a conceipt of this, and we thinke we cannot chuse but be sa∣ued, thus the Diuell taking aduantage of our pride, doth teach men to encroach vpon the doctrine of the holy Ghost, for whereas he hath taught that good life and ho∣nest conuersation serues onely as an euidence and necessa∣ry proofe of true faith in the bloud of Christ, the diuell teacheth to aduance these things to a higher place of dignity,Gal. 5.4. euen to shoulder out Gods grace and merits of Christ in our iustification, but wee must know as the Apo∣stle hath taught vs, if we looke to be iustified by any thing in our selues we are abolished &c. faith in Christ Iesus and confidence in good workes cannot stand together, faith and good workes euer goe together, and true faith is euer fruitfull in good workes, but faith and confidence or opi∣nion of the merit of good workes cannot stand together. If we looke to be iustified and saued by Christ, wee must cleaue onely vnto him, and vtterly renounce confidence of all things in our selues, wee must iudge our selues, and condemn our selues in regard of any thing in vs, and plead nothing but mercy and forgiuenesse, wee must goe out of our selues and fixe our faith vpon Iesus Christ, and be ful∣ly perswaded in our hearts, that his death is our ransome,  his righteousnesse our righteousnesse, and make him our perfect Sauiour and Redeemer,Sanctified loue must be expressed in the fruits of it chiefly to such as are sancti∣fied and to all such. build vpon him as a rocke that neuer can be shaken, and then the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against vs, and so much of the obiect of faith. Now come wee to the obiect of loue, that is (all Saints) true sanctified loue comming from faith is to be extended
in the fruits of it to all men, as they are men bearing the image of God, but especially, to such as are sanctified and renued according to Gods image in some measure of ho∣linesse, and it must be teached generally to all Saints, as the Colossians did, so we are not onely to loue one or two or a certaine set number, but all Saints without exception, we are to beare hearty affection to all generally, and to ex∣presse it in duties of loue, to as many as we are able (saith Dauid) Lord my weldoing &c. but to the Saints,Psal. 16.5. and hee speakes indefinitely, to the Saints that are heere on earth and to the excellent; reasons of this are these, first, all the Saints are members of one body, and it is a law layd on the members of the naturall body by the prouidence of God, that what ability is giuen to any member, it should be vsed for the good of the whole body, and of euery part of the body? that the sight of the eye should bee vsed as well for the direction of the foot, as for the guiding of the hand. So in the mysticall body of Christ, what good pra∣cticall grace or affection is wrought in any, it should bee extended to the good of the whole body, and of euery particular member of the body. Secondly, there is the same reason and ground of loue in euery Saint of God; namely, the image of God renued, their holines and feare of God, though not the same measure, they all resemble God their Father in some degree of holinesse, and shew that they are begotten of the immortall seed of his word, therfore loue being bounded & set on goodnes, & that be¦ing found in some measure in euery Saint of God, we are to extend our loue to all & euery Saint & seruant of God, but for the better cleering of this point a question must be answered, namely,  this seeing we are to loue all the Saints of God, the question may be whether weare to loue them all alike or no? Answ. First,  in respect of the different de∣grees of men, there must be different degrees of loue: the Magistrate and the Minister being publique persons fea∣ring God, are to be loued with a greater measure of loue
then priuate persons, because they beare a double image of God, inward in sanctified grace, outward in place & au∣thority. Secondly, in equall comparison, when men are equall in degree, we are then in the first place, principally to loue and shew duties of loue to Parents, children and such as are conioyned and tied vnto vs by nature, or any outward bond of marriage or friendship, because wee are bound to loue them by a double bond of nature and of grace, grace doth not abolish naturall affection, but onely order it and dispose it aright, and so the question is answered and the doctrine cleered. Is it so that we are to loue all the Saints of God, then farre be it from vs to loue one and hate another,Partiall loue of other re∣proued. that lan∣guage and speech ought not be heard out of our mouthes, I loue such a one euen from my heart, because he is an ho∣nest man, but such an one happily as honest as he I cannot abide, and it may bee wee cannot abide him, euen be∣cause he is one that in our conceipt is too forward in the feare of God, are we not in this case become partiall in our selues,Iam. 2.4. as if our loue be thus partiall, wee loue one Saint of God and not another, let our pretence be what it will, that we loue him, because hee is an honest man, in deede and truth we loue him not as a Saint, not for God, & his graces in him, but in some other respect either for pleasure or profit, it is not possible for vs to loue one as a Saint and fearing God, but we must loue all that feare God, because all in their measure haue in them that which is truely ami∣able and louely. Againe, if we loue some and not others, we make it plaine, we yet loue not God, can we perswade our selues that we loue God, and loue not some whom he loueth, can a man say he loues his friend and yet hate any one of his children,1. Ioh. 2.20. no certainly hee cannot no more can we truly say &c. If any man say I loue God, and yet hate his brother, he is a childe of him that is the father of lies, c. 3. 10. In this are the children &c. Let then the considera∣tion of these things stir vs vp to put away partiall affection,
let vs beare and shew hearty loue to all the Saints of God, so we may haue testimony that our loue is sanctified, and that wee loue God, and from thence may rise vp to an assurance of his loue in Iesus Christ. Now to the fifth verse. VER. 5. For the hopes sake &c. In this verse, the Apostle doth lay before vs two things. First, wherefore it was that the Colossians continued con∣stant in their faith in Christ Iesus and loue towards all Saints. What was the motiue that stirred them vp to goe on in faith and loue, namely, the hope layd vp for them in Heauen. Secondly, the meanes how they came to the knowledge of that hope, and that was by their hearing of the Gospell, which is described to be the word of truth and their hearing of this hope, by the preaching of the Go∣spell is further amplified by the time that they heard of it, before the writing of this Epistle. Whereof (sayth the A∣postle) ye haue heard before, come wee to the first of these two generall things in these words, for the hopes sake, by hope in this place wee are to vnderstand, not the gift or grace of hope wrought in true beleeuers following true faith, but the thing hoped for, the thing certainely expe∣cted of all that truely beleeue eternall happinesse, glory and life euerlasting, and that is cleere out of the text it selfe, because the gift or grace of hope is in the heart, but this is heere sayd to bee layd vp in heauen: (laid vp) that phrase is borrowed from Parents, who lay vp good things to bee giuen in time to come to their children, the meaning is that the Lord hath as it were laid vp, prouided and prepared life, happines and glory in time to be giuen to his children, so we find it in the last doome that Christ shall pronounce vpon the blessed of his father,
Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdome prepared, &c.Mat. 25.34. In heauen, that is in the place and seat of the blessed Angells and Saints, whether Christ is ascended, and from whence he shall come to iudgement, this then is the true sence of these words, for the eternall happinesse life and glories sake, prepared of the Lord from all eterniry in time to be giuen you in the highest heauens. Now first in that glory and life to come is called by the name of hope, one of these is put for another, one to signifie another, hope to signifie heauen. True christian hope must not only haue reference to life eternall, but must be a resemblance of it.Hence we may take vp this conclusion, that true chri∣stian hope, or the hope of true Christians must not only haue reference to life eternall, but it must be a resemblance of life hoped for, and in some sort be correspondent vnto it: for as in metonimicall and sacramentall speeches, when one thing is set downe to signifie another, there is a resem∣blance and similitude between those things, as the bread in the sacrament resembleth the body of Christ, so our hope put for heauen, it must be a resemblance of heauen, it must in som sort expresse eternal life laid vp for vs in hea∣uen; how can that be, may some say? Answer, by working in vs euen in this life a beginning of life eternall, by ma∣king our life and conuersation heauenly, or as the Apostle speakes,Phil. 3.20. in heauen. Then is our hope a liuely image fit to resemble life eternall, when it is manifested in the begin∣nings of life eternall, when it is effectuall to turne vs from sinne to God, and to worke in vs newnesse and holinesse of life. And that true christian hope is such a resemblance of eternall life, and is thus effectuall and so ought to be in vs. Marke that place of the Apostle, our conuersation (saith he) is in heauen.Phil 3.20. What is his ground? euen our hope of the glorification of our bodies, and fulnesse of glory at the comming of Christ, for he saith in the verse folowing, from whence,1. Iohn 3.3. &c. we haue a plaine text to this purpose, saith S. Iohn, we know, &c. and euery man that hath this hope, &c. whosoeuer hath true hope he is thereby stirred vp vnto
daily repentance and reformation of life. Now for the vse  of this, there is neuer a one of vs of yeers and of discretion, but we will say we hope for life eternall,Triall of our hope of life and saluation in heauen. and we looke for happinesse, and glory in heauen by the mercy of God in Christ. But would any know whether his hope be a true Christian hope or no, such a hope as will not deceiue nor disappoint him in time of need, no not in death it selfe, let him then examine it by this note, if his hope be a resemblance of life eternall, if it doe expresse in his life the beginnings of that life laid vp in heauen in som measure of purity, holinesse, innocency, meeknesse, and loue, &c. so that a man may say of him as we vse to speake of a child towardly and of an ingenious countenance, that he is optimae Spei one of excellent hope, then his hope is in∣deed religious and christian, such as will comfort him when the pangs of death are vpon him. But if otherwise he say he hopes for life and saluation, and yet be not able to shew it in some conformity, similitude, and likenesse vn∣to life eternall, but his life is rather an expresse image of his naturall corruption, his life is stained with many foule sinnes, that mans hope is but a pretence of hope, and in the end it will deceiue and make him ashamed, can a man say and that truly, he hopes for heauen, and yet his very breath stinkes of hell, he breaths and belches out blasphemous oathes, railings, cursings, slanderings, &c. and hath his tongue set on fire with the fire of hell, as S. Iames saith, third Chapter verse 6. can any say that he lookes vp to hea∣uen, and beholds the fulnesse of happinesse and glory in heauen, and yet his eies are full of adultery as the Apostle speakes.2. Pet. 2.14. We know we cannot see the sunne when a thicke cloud is before it,Mat. 5.8. and can we imagine that we see the brightnesse of glory in heauen, through the thicke foggy mist of many sinnes? it is not possible, our sauiour hath said it. That only the poore in heart, such as are purged both from the guiltinesse and filthinesse of their sinnes shall see God, shall see by their faith in this life the comfor∣table
beames of the Lords liuing countenance shining vpon them in Christ, and shall see him face to face, euen the brightnesse of his glory to their eternall comfort in the life to come. In the second place in that the Apostle doth testifie that he heard of the constancy of the Colossians in their faith and loue; towards all Saints for the glories sake laid vp for them in heauen, we are taught that it is the  stedfast looking into heauen, that doth keepe and hold true beleeuers in a constant course of religion,The stedfast looking into heauen doth keep true beleeuers in a constant course of religion. it is that which makes them cleaue fast to Christ. and keepe fellow∣ship and communion with the Saints, for though we are not to depart from sinne or do good, for this end only or principally that we may obtaine eternall life, for then we shall neuer obtaine it, because this end and purpose pro∣ceeds from selfe loue, though we are not to auoid euill or doe good, chiefly in respect of reward or feare of punish∣ment, but in respect of Gods glory and our owne duty, yet in the duty of religion and loue, we may haue an in∣ferior subordinate and second respect vnto the recom∣pence of reward, and to make vs constant in well do∣ing, life euerlasting must euer be in our eie, at which we must continually aime. We read that Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ,Heb. 11.26. &c. for why saith the text he had respect vnto, &c. vers. 27. He forsooke Aegypt, &c. for he endured, &c. He had his eie vpon heauen, and vpon God in heauen, the rewarder of them that seeke him, and by faith depend vpon him, and that made him lightly esteeme the trou∣bles and trialls of this life, and not to feare the rage and fu∣ry of Pharaoh or of any man liuing. Would we then for vse  of this) stand fast in our profession of faith,We must learne to cast our hope as the anchor of our soules within the vaile of heauen. Heb. 6.19. would we be constant in religion, and the feare of God, amidst the trou∣bles and miseries of this life, yea in the midst of many vio∣lent assaults and strong temptations of Satan, then learne we to cast our hope, the anchor of our soules, as the holy Ghost calls it, within the vaile of heauen, let vs lift vp the eies of our minds and fasten them on that glory and blisse
that is prepared and laid vp in heauen, for all them that loue the appearing of the Lord Iesus, then we shall be able to put vpon vs Iobs resolution, Though the Lord should kill me, &c. and in the houre of temptation and pangs of death, we shall cleaue fast vnto Christ by faith,Iob 13.15. and hold our communion with the Saints, it is not possible that such as professe faith and religion, and yet mind earthly things, and haue their minds groueling on the things of this world and professe in respect of wealth, that they should hold out in faith and in the feare of God, in the time of triall and temptation, the diuell could thus reason, doth Iob feare God for naught? as if he had said,Iob 1.9. Iobs feare and seruice of God is but in respect of his wealth and prosperity, therfore lay but thine hand vpon him, and he will start aside from his feare, he will then shew himselfe to be but an hypocrite. Though the diuell was deceiued in Iob, yet he hath shew∣ed by this manner of reasoning that he knowes well that such as professe in respect of wealth and outward prospe∣rity, they are soone driuen from their profession, by the least triall or temptation. Therefore this ought to stir vs vp in our profession, to respect chiefly the glory of God and our duty, and then labor to fix our eies on the marke and price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus, that so we may be constant and perseuere in time of triall and temptation, which may come vpon vs we know not how soone. It followeth (laid vp) this phrase as hath been shew∣ed, is borrowed from parents to bring within the com∣passe of our vnderstanding the Lords eternall decree, and his purpose, to bestow life and glory vpon his children, our  instruction hēce is easily gathered, namely this;Such as truly beleeue in Christ and hold coniun∣ction with the Saints, may looke for life and glory in heauen. in that life and glory is laid vp with the Lord in his eternall councell. We may conclude it shall in time be giuen to such as truly beleeue in Christ, and hold fellowship and commu∣nion with the Saints, it is laid vp for them, they shall not misse of it, they may certainly expect it. Our Apostle doth thus build vpon it, that he hauing finished his course and
kept the faith,2. Tim. 4 8. thenceforth was laid vp for him, &c. and that the Lord the righteous iudge would giue it vnto him, at the day of his departure, out of this life, and not only to him but to all them also, &c. We may further be resolued of this truth by considering the end, why naturall parents prouide and lay vp good things for their children, apply∣ing that by way of similitude to the Lord, for what is their intent and purpose, in their prouiding laying vp and care∣full keeping of good things? surely in time to endow and to enrich their children, and it is either change of affection or want of ability, that makes voide their purpose, either because their loue is turned into hatred, or because they are not able to do that they purposed, now the Lord ha∣uing purposed and intended from all eternity in time to endow and enrich his children with treasures of eternall life and glory. What is it that may frustrate and make void his purpose? is it change of his loue? not possible, his loue is essentiall in him, as vnchangeable as himselfe, he loues for euer whom he loues once. Is it want of power? we can∣not so imagine, he is omnipotent the God of all power, no∣thing in heauen earth, or hell, is able to withstand or hin∣der him from effecting his purpose, therefore happinesse and eternall glory being intended by him to his children in his eternall loue that neuer changeth laid vp for them vnder his hands, and keeping who is able to keep and to bestow it at his good pleasure and that in heauen a place of all safety and security, where it cannot be corrupted, stai∣ned, wax old, or waste and weare away, as the Apostle saith, It must needs in time come to them for whom it is prepa∣red and appointed of the Lord,1. Pet. 1.4. that is to such as beleeue and hold fellowship and communion with the Saints; a matter for the vse of it of great comfort to all that truely  beleeue, to them only the comfort of it doth belong. Comfort to all that truly beleeue in Christ.First therefore, let our meditation in this point be to this purpose, is life and glory laid vp for vs, in time to be giuen vnto vs, then let vs not be dismaid and vtterly deiected,
though we loose all that euer we enioy in this world, far be it from vs vpon the losse of the transitory and fading things of this world, to cry out and say we are vtterly vn∣done, how shall we do? whether shall we turne our selues? let these distempered speeches arguing want of hope bee heard out of the mouthes of such as want hope, and be far from vs, let not vs feare what man or diuell can doe vnto vs, it is the encouragement our Sauiour giues vpon this very ground. Feare not, &c. euery word hath the waight of an argument, as if he had said,Luk 12.32. feare not the losse or want of earthly things (he there handleth the argument of Gods prouidence) it is your kind and louing father that doth tender your estate and hath care of it, it standeth with his good will and pleasure freely to giue without any merit of yours the kingdome, that is that heauenly kingdome prepared for you, why then should you feare, Nay saith he vers. 4. I say vnto you be not afraid of them that kill the body, that is, feare not them that are able to take away your temporall liues, they can go no further, they cannot strip you of life eternall, that is beyond their reach, they cannot enter vpon your soules to hurt them, they are your free∣holds, free from the rage and violence of satan, and an his instruments. Nay yet more then this, in that life and glory is laid vp in time to be giuen vs if we beleeue in Christ. we may hence receiue further comfort though it be so that our braines be dasht against the walls, our bones scattered in the streets, our blood run downe the channell, yet our bodies so mangled and martyred, shall be raised againe re∣stored by the power of God, and be crowned together with our soules with happinesse and glory, and our tongues  shall send foorth the praise of him that sits vpon the throne with maiesty and honor for euer,Expectation of ease, com∣fort, and deli∣uerance in time of trou∣ble streng∣thened. &c. that is our first vse of this, that life and glory is laid vp, and in time shall be giuen vnto vs. Againe, secondly the consideration of this may streng∣then vs in our expectation, of ease and comfort and deli∣uerance
in time of trouble, and distresse, that in the Lords good time wee shall not faile of ease, comfort, and deliuerance, for why? hath the Lord layd vp eternall life and glory in time to bee giuen vs, shall we not misse of it, may wee certainely expect it? so also hath the Lord layd vp ease, comfort, deliuerance &c. for all his distressed children in his good time to be giuen vnto them, and as we are to waite with Iob all the daies of our appoin∣ted time,Iob 14.14. till our last changing shall come, our changing from misery and sinne to happinesse and glory, so are we in all times of trouble, and distresses to wait till our chan∣ging shall come from the Lord,Isay 63.3. till it please the Lord to giue vs beauty for ashes, &c. To change our sorrow into ioy, our sicknesse into health, and to deliuer vs out of our distresse, it is a fruit of our corruption to be impatient of delay, to make hast to be deliuered and to seeke by vnlaw∣full meanes as the fashion of some is in present trouble, they must haue present helpe, or else they will fetch it from hell it selfe, by meanes of witches, sorcerers, and such like. Let them know, whosoeuer they be, that are thus hasty, that this is a manifest demonstration of their want of faith and trust in God for life eternall, shall we say we trust God vpon his word for happinesse in heauen, and yet trust him not vpon his promise for helpe in time of need? can we perswade our selues that we beleeue there is life and glory laid vp in store with the Lord in time to be giuen vs, and yet not beleeue there is comfort and deliuerance with the Lord in time of trouble? no, no, if we trust not God for the lesse, we cannot trust him for the greater, either then trust in the Lord in time of trouble, and with patience ex∣pect comfort from him, or else thou hast not yet learned to waite vpon his mercy for saluation, and remember the words of the Prophet.Isay 28.16. He that beleeueth, makes not hast, an infallible character and badge of him that beleeues is this, he makes not haste. If thou then make hast thou belee∣uest not.
Now heere a question must be answered in that the A∣postle sayth, life and glory is layd vp,  some may demand how this can agree with that, where beleeuers are forbid∣den by Christ to lay vp &c. whereby treasures, is meant eternall glory, and if that be layd vp, how then can they themselues lay it vp? For answer, wee must learne to distinguish and make a difference betweene the essence and substance of glory & the degree & measure of glory. Now the first of these is meant in this place, that the substance of glory standing in the fruition of the presence of God, fellowship and society with God the Father, Son and holy Ghost, and with the Angels and Saints is laid vp for true beleeuers, but the measure of glory may be laid vp, and may bee encreased by themselues, they by their good works of faith may trea∣sure vp a greater measure and degree of glory, a greater re∣ward in Heauen which shall be giuen, not for the merit of their workes, but of the meere mercy of God, who in the day of retribution will crowne his owne gifts not our me∣rits, and where he findes greater measure of gifts, greater measure of the workes of faith, there he will in mercy be∣stow greater measure of glory according to that of the A∣postle,2. Cor 9.6. 1. Cor. 15.41. hee that soweth sparingly &c. hee that soweth liberally &c. and as hee saith, as one differeth in brightnesse from ano∣ther, so there shall be greater measure of glory in one Saint then in another, according to the measure of the workes of faith, this I take to bee the meaning of our Sauiour, in saying, lay vp &c. that is treasure for our selues, a measure of glory, and adde one measure to another,True belee∣uers haue not their happi∣nesse in pre∣sent possessi∣on but in re∣uersion. 2. Cor. 5.7. 1. Ioh. 3.2. as men in hea∣ping  and hoarding vp riches adde one shilling and one pound to another. Now further, in that the Apostle sayth, the happinesse of true beleeuers, is laid vp for them in Heauen, he would haue knowen that they haue it not in present possession, but in reuersion, in hope and expectation, they liue heere by faith &c, and as Saint Iohn sayth it yet appeares not
how glorious they shall be, though the Lord giue them a taste of Heauen in this life in the first fruits of his Spirit, in peace of conscience and ioy in the holy Ghost to comfort and stay their hearts, yet they must expect full fruition of happinesse in Heauen in the life to come. Our vse  of this, is that which the Apostle hath taught Chap. 2.We must lift vp our hearts and affections to the highest heauens. that seeing our happinesse and fulnesse of ioy and comfort is not in any thing vnder the Sunne, but laid vp in the highest Heauens, wee therefore should lift vp our hearts thither, and set our affections &c. and to helpe for∣ward, and stirre vp our dulnesse, in this respect consider we but these two things. First, to set our affections on earthly things, it is such an high degree of sinne, as our Apostle could not think of it, but with a bleeding heart, nor speak of it but with teares trickling downe his cheekes: and marke the steppes by which he comes vnto it,Phil. 3.18.19. many walke &c. Againe, to set our affections on the things of this world, will not onely make vs lose the hold that we seeme to haue of Heauen (for we cannot compasse Heauen and earth together) but the very remembrance of Heauen, ex∣perience shewes this. For speake to a worldly minded man, of the ioyes of the life to come, of the eternall waight of glory that shall be reuealed, and hee is no more moued then a stone in the wall, he hath no apprehension of it, if then we would not aspire to that high degree of sinne, that will make an honest heart bleed to thinke or speake of it: if wee would not lose the hold we seeme to haue of Hea∣uen, the very remembrrance of Heauen, let vs lift vp our hearts and our affections and not suffer them to settle and rest on earthtly things, let vs vse them as trauellers to help vs forward in our iourney towards Heauen, but let our chiefe care and affection bee on Heauen and heauenly things, and so much of the first generall part of this verse, in these words (for the hopes sake) Now to the second part of it, in the wordes following (whereof &c.) the wordes neede no long expositon, the word (Gospell) is a word
well knowen to euery one in sound, but happily to few in sence and signification. It signifieth in generall good ty∣dings, but in speciall the tydings or the promulgation of the free grace and mercy of God in Christ, it is an eui∣dence or declaration of Gods couenant of grace, it signifi∣eth that part of the word of God, that containes the pro∣mise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting, made to all that truely beleeue in Christ, and repent of their sinnes, it is called the word of truth, or (as the words are) of that truth, in a double respect. First, because it is of absolute and infallible truth without errour, being published first by God, who is truth it selfe, after by Prophets and Apo∣stles, to whom it was reuealed by inspiration and instinct of the holy Ghost, and by them preached and written without errour. Secondly, by a kinde of excellency aboue the law, because it doth containe and publish that eternall and sauing truth, whereby we come to the knowledge of righteousnesse and saluation by Christ, which wee could not haue by the law, nor was euer reuealed by the law, heere first we are to obserue that the Colossians heard of life and glory layd vp in heauen for them, by the Gospell  and so came to the knowledge of it, whence it followeth,Knowledge of life eternall comes by hearing. that the knowledg of life eternal coms by hearing, it is not in vs by nature, but it enters in by the eare, the listning & lending of the eare to the word preached, is the ordinary outward means, wherby knowledge of saluation is wroght in the heart; for sauing faith which comprehends both knowledge of Gods mercy, and affiance in his mercy, by which we are saued, comes by hearing,Rom. 10.17. when Adam fell from God, he knew what blessing hee had lost, and into what misery he was fallen, that was the knowledge of good and euill, the diuell promised and he got but hee had no sight of rising, no knowledge of restoring to the state of grace and saluation, till he heard it from the mouth of the Lord, that the seed of the woman should breake the ser∣pents head, and so by nature there is no knowledge of sal∣uation
but a sight of euerlasting death and damnation, in∣deed the heathen groped after happinesse, and dreamed of Elisian fields, but had no true sight of it, till it was reuealed to them by the sound of the Gospell. Hence then learne we what pretious accompt wee are to make of hearing of the word.We are to make precious accompt of hearing the word of God. Is it so that by hearing of it we come to faith, and knowledge of saluation, then think that our eares are put to the best vse when they are hearing of the word, for then they are exercised in a businesse that tends to the sauing of our soules, and let vs not with giddy headed Monkes and swelling Enthusiasts, thinke basely of hearing, and thinke we shall come to the knowledge of saluation, by idle visions and phantasticall reuelations; they brag much of dreames and priuate illumination of the spirit, and so ioyne the word and spirit which the Apo∣stle hath coupled together, he calls his preaching the mini∣stration of the spirit,2. Cor. 3.8. to note that the word and spirit are so neerly conioyned, that they must alwaies goe together, the spirit shineth in the word, and the word is powerfull by the spirit, and we must be taught of God, but by the word the Lord puts them together,Isay 59.21. I will make this my coue∣nant, &c. and by reason of this coniunction of the word and spirit, the preaching of the word is an instrument of grace and saluation, therefore we are not to depend vpon visions and reuelations from heauen, but to make pretious accompt of hearing the word. And againe let vs not with contemners of the word reason thus, if I be appointed vn∣to life and saluation, I shall come vnto it as well as they that heare all the sermons in the world, that is a dangerous rock on which many soules suffer shipwracke. Rather rea∣son thus with thy selfe, am I carelesse of the meanes the Lord hath appointed to bring me to the knowledge of saluation, then I may iustly feare that I belong not to Gods election. For whom the Lord hath appointed to such an end, he hath appointed to the meanes, and doth sweetly incline and bend the purpose of the will that way; whom
he hath predestinated them he hath called by the prea∣ching of his word.Rom. 8.30. It is the subtlety and cunning of the diuell to worke in the heart a perswasion of indifferencie, where the Lord by his ordinance hath laid a necessity, that the hearing of the word which the Lord hath appointed a necessary outward meanes to bring to the knowledge of saluation, is but a thing indifferent, and to perswade that a man may be saued, though he be carelesse of the meanes of saluation. Let vs learne to take heed of this subtlety, consi∣der and take we but a short view of the state of such as lightly regard the hearing of the word, they walke in the darknesse and vanity of their minds, they rush into errors, breake out into blasphemies, runne into all sorts of sinne, they degenerate into the nature of bruit beasts, and grow worse then they. For why they haue no strength against the corruption of their owne hearts; nor any power of grace to withstand the temptation of satan, but with full swing run after the vanities of the world, and the pleasures of sinne, and so lie open to Gods wrath, which hangs ouer the heads of all vnbeleeuers, being destitute of Christ the robe of righteousnesse, wanting faith, mortification, san∣ctification, and the whole armour of God, a state wretched and damnable; let the consideration of it moue vs to make a speciall accompt of hearing the word, wherby our iudge∣ments may be informed, our wills reformed, our affections ordered, and euery thought brought into captiuity to the obedience of Christ. In the second place we are to marke that the Colossians came to the knowledge of life and glo∣ry, laid vp for them in heauen, by hearing the Gospell, whence we learne that the doctrine of the Gospell, the do∣ctrine  of remission of sinnes,The doctrine of the Gospell is that which brings men to the know∣ledge of their saluation. and life euerlasting by Christ exhibited in the flesh, is that in particular which brings men to the knowledge of their saluation. For why the Gos∣pell of Christ is the only charter and euidence of that hea∣uenly inheritance, that is prepared for them that shall be saued. It is not the booke of the creatures, the visible frame
of the world, that can reueale or make it knowen, that serues onely to leaue men without excuse,Rom. 1.20. it is not any ex∣traordinary worke of Gods iustice, any of his iudgements which are reall and visible sermons, they bring not to the knowledge of mercy, neither is it the hearing of the law, because there is no seed of faith, either in the law of nature, nor any reuelation of it by the morall law of God, the law is no instrumentall cause of faith, repentance or any other sauing grace; the morall law is called by the Apostle a kil∣ling letter,2. Cor. 3.7. the Minister of death and condemnation. And the Gospell is there sayd to giue life, and is called the mi∣nistration of righteousnesse and of the Spirit.Gal. 3.2. And indeed it is the hearing of the Gospell that doth conferre the Spi∣rit of adoption,Act. 5.20. as the Apostle sayth. Hence is the Gospell called the word of life, the word of saluation, and therfore the hearing of the Gospell onely brings the knowledge of life and saluation.Act. 13.26. Whereto then serues the hearing of the law? The Apostle makes answer as our schoolemaster  to bring men to the knowledge and feeling of sinne, to the knowledge of the curse,Gal. 3.24. and punishment due to the same without remedy, and so to compell them to goe to Christ set forth vnto them in the Gospell. The point then being cleere the vse of it is this. First it maketh knowen who they be that do truly and rightly preach the Gospell,Who they be that do truely and rightly preach the Gospell. namely, they who doe aime and driue at that, and in some measure effect that which is the proper worke of the Gospell, that is, bring men to faith in Christ, & certain knowledg of their own saluation, The Papists teaching that holds men in suspence and makes men doubt of their owne saluation, and giues them no certaine light, nor knowledge of life and glory layd vp for them in heauen, is not the true teaching: The Gospell is then truely preached when the preaching thereof is pow∣erfull by the worke of the spirit, to conferre the Spirit of adoption, whereby beleeuers know that there is life and
saluation layd vp for them in Heauen. Againe, hence learne wee who they bee that rightly  heare the preaching of the Gospell, namely,Who they be that rightly heare the preaching of the Gospell. they who are brought by hearing of it, to a true sight of their owne sal∣uation, that life and glory is layd vp for them in Heauen, the Gospell is powerfull in it selfe to bring men to the knowledge of saluation, it is the arme of the Lord to that purpose, and if it be not thus powerfull in thee, to worke in thee vpon good ground, faith and repentance, and a measure of true knowledge and assurance of thine owne saluation,2. Cor. 4.3. thou hast not profited by hearing of it as thou oughtest, and then marke what the Apostle sayth, if the Gospell be hid &c. If thou be not able to see that light that shineth in the Gospell, touching remission of sinnes and saluation, it is a signe of perdition. Againe, consider that the diuels vnderstand both the law and the Gospell, and giue assent to the Gospell to be true, they goe so far, if thou then be not brought to some measure of assurance of sal∣uation thou hast not yet gone beyond the diuels, who are already in hell. Let then these things worke vpon thee thus farre, to draw thee to examine how thou hast profi∣ted by the preaching of the Gospell. The Apostle heere calles the gospell the (word of truth)  that is absolute sauing truth,Their opini∣on is false, who hold; euery man li∣uing an out∣ward ciuill life may bee saued in any religion. hence it followes that the o∣pinion of such is false, who hold that euery man liuing an outward ciuill life may be saued in any religion, the Iew in his Iudaisme, the Turke in his Turcisme, and the Heathen in his Paganisme. For reason teacheth that truth is simple, & one error is manifold, and there is one way to do well, and many wayes to doe euill. Now euery Art and Sci∣ence hath his truth, but sauing truth, is the truth of the go∣spell, and there is but one gospell, one in number, no more, and therefore but one way of saluation that is by true faith in Christ. VER. 6. Which is come vnto you, &c.
In this verse, the Apostle proceedes in commendation of the gospell, and not contenting himselfe to call it the word of truth, he goes on further to commend it, and that by two arguments. The frst is taken from the wonder∣full diffusion and spreading of it, that it was diffused and spread one all the world, that the sound and preaching of it was come to all the parts of the world, in particular to the Colossians, (which is come vnto you &c.) Secondly, he commends it from the effectuall working and fruiteful∣nes of it, and that both in generall in all the world and in speciall among the Colossians, (for so the sentence must bee supplied and made vp in the wordes following, as if the Apostle had sayd is fruitfull in all the world, as it is also among you &c. and this argument of the fruitfull working of the Gospell in speciall among the Colossians is further amplified by the circumstance of time, that it was fruitefull among them, from the very day they heard and knew the Gospell whis is deliuered vnder the name of the grace of God, the matter of it, and by their manner of hearing and embracing of it, expressed in the word (truely, or in truth) from the day that ye heard &c. these are the generall things contained in this verse, come we to the first argument of commendation (come vnto you) that is published and preached among you as the Apostle,Rom. 10.15. citing the words of the Prophet sayth, how beautifull are the feet or comming of them, and his meaning is how ex∣cellent and pleasant is the preaching of the Gospell as ap∣peares in the next verse, but they haue not all obeyed (vnto all the world) that is to all the parts of the world, Asia, Afri∣ca, Europe and America, and to the chiefe nations and kingdomes of those parts, and from them, if not the prea∣ching yet the fame and sound of the Gospell came to bor∣dering nations: so that in the time of the Apostle there were very few or almost none, vnto whom either the prea∣ching of the Gospell or the fame of Christ had not come Hence is the preaching of the Gospell compared by the
Apostle to the sound or voice of the heauens, that as the heauens that beauty, motion influence shew and as it were speake and sound foorth the glory of God to all na∣tions, so (sayth the Apostle) applying that of the Psal∣mist by the way of similitude to the preaching of the Go∣spell no doubt their sound &c.Rom. 19.18. Some may say we read of certaine nations newly con∣uerted to the faith, as this land of ours,Ob. long after the time of the Apostles? It is true,  but that is to bee vnderstood of the publike profession of the Gospell countenanced by authority, the gospell sounded forth in the daies of the A∣postles to all the world, but it was not receiued by publike authority till the time of the Emperors Constantine & The∣odosius. Now to the doctrine. First we are to marke the phrase vsed by the Apostle, he  sayth not the Gospell which is preached,The Lord in mercy offers his Gospell vnto men and brings it home vnto them. but come vnto you, whence wee may take vp this conclusion, that the Lord in mercy sends vnto vs his word of grace, the pro∣mise of remission of sinnes and life by Christ, he doth of his owne good pleasure send and offer vnto vs his Gospell, the meanes of grace and saluation, by which men are brought to the knowledge of saluation, it is brought home vnto vs, we send not for it, no surely, if it were not brought we should neuer seeke for it, and the reason is plaine wee haue no vnderstanding of the excellent comfort of it, much lesse any desire after it in nature, it is aboue the reach of na∣ture created euen of nature pure in the state of the first cre∣ation, much more is it aboue the reach of nature, in the state of sinne and corruption, it pleaseth the Lord there∣fore in mercy to send vnto vs his Gospell, to offer the means of grace and saluation. We read,Pro. 9.3. Wsdome sends forth her maides freely to inuite the simple &c. to eat of her meat and drinke of her wine, and the Lord sayth,Ier. 7.25. hee sent all his seruants the Prophets rising vp early &c. and the Sonne of God himselfe Christ Iesus sayth,Reu 3.20. he doth stand at our doore
and knocke, behold &c. if any man heare &c. Now the vse  of this point is this, is it so that the Lord doth send vnto vs his Gospell, doth hee offer vnto vsThe Lord re∣quires that we receiue the Gospell offered vnto vs. the meanes of grace and saluation, what then doth the Lord require of vs? surely that we receiue his Gospell, for to that end is it offered, that we should beleeue and embrace it, and submit our selues to the power of it: which in the right vse is powerfull to worke in vs true faith and true re∣pentance. Now then consider this poynt, it hath pleased the Lord in mercy to vouchsafe vnto vs, the Gospell of sal∣uation coūtenanced by publike authority, for the space of fifty yeeres together, his name be blessed for it, at the first entrance and preaching of the Gospell when the preach∣ing of it was rare and scarse, then it was most welcome to many, they greatly reioyced in it, and tooke great delight in the sweet comfort of it, but afterward when the preach∣ing of it was more plentifull, and it was brought home vn∣to vs, then men beganne to waxe weary of it, as the Israe∣lites did of Manna, and wish that they had neuer beene troubled with so much preaching, a maruelous thing that we should grow weary of the goodnesse of God, offering mercy vnto vs, yet so it is the speech is generall in euerie mans mouth, that hath any feeling of grace, that our won∣ted loue and zeale to the Gospell, is almost vtterly extinct & cleane gone, the three capitall and maine sinnes of the world, Saint Iohn speakes of, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,1. Ioh. 2.16. and the pride of life, sensuality and wanton plea∣sures, couetousnes & ambition haue so taken vp the hearts and liues of most men, that there is nothing to be found in many of vs but a meere neglect or contempt of the Gospell. But let vs take heed, if the Gospell the meanes of grace, comming and being offered vnto vs, serue only for conuiction, and not for conuersion, to conuince and not conuert vs, it will conuince vs of such a sinne as stands in the sight of God naked,Ioh. 15.22. and void of all excuse. If I had not come and spoken, &c. And consider further these two
things. First, the stabilitie of our estate stands in our obedi∣ence to the Gospell: for when we entertaine and obey the Gospell, our state is founded in the Kingdome of God: where the Gospell is embraced, there is Gods Kingdome, as the Prophet saith; Thy God raigneth,Isay 52.7. & his Kingdome is most stable and firme, nothing is able to ouerturne it. If then our estate be founded in Gods Kingdome, we may be assured of the continuance of it, & of whatsoeuer may serue for our good. Would wee then haue our estate neuer to change, but to the better? no doubt euery man desires it: then learne we to submit our selues to the Gospell of the Kingdome of God. Againe, consider we, though the Lord still continue his comming vnto vs by his Gospell, and still offer and reach out vnto vs the meanes of grace and salua∣tion, yet wee know not how long he will so doe; hee may we know not how soone, either take the Gospell from vs, or vs from the Gospell: and if we refuse to receiue his grace offered by the comming of his Gospell, hee will force his iudgements vpon vs by the comming of himselfe, by his owne immediate hand, as he hath already begun. As he is kind to offer grace, so he is iust to reuenge the wilfull con∣tempt of his offer, and he will proportion out the punish∣ment due to the refusall of his mercie, he will make it sute∣able and agreeable to the sinne, that as we reiect and light∣ly regard his mercie offered, so in time of trouble hee will not regard our misery, but he will laugh,Pro. 1.26. &c. a sentence full of terrour. If the Lord, who in trouble should comfort vs, when all other comforts faile and forsake vs, if he will then deride and mocke vs, that is, by the course of his proui∣dēce, leaue vs in misery, & make vs a mocking stock to the world, it must needs be a state almost as hard to be borne as hell it selfe. Let this be thought vpon, and let it stir vs vp in this our time and day of saluation, to accept the meanes of grace and saluation, and to submit our selues in faith and obedience to the word of the Gospell. It followeth, (euen as it is, &c.) hence we may conclude, that the Gospel
the meanes of saluation is vniuersall, it is indifferently of∣fered vnto all sorts of men,The Gospell and meanes of saluation is indifferently offered to all sorts of men. Rom. 1.16. Rom. 15.8. without respect or distinction of persons or difference of people, to Iewes and Gentiles, as the Apostle saith. It is the power of God, &c. To the Iew first, and also to, &c. First to the Iewes, in respect of order, because Christ was the minister of circumcision: and when he first sent foorth his Apostles, he forbade them to goe into the way of the Gentiles, &c. but in his last com∣mission giuen at his ascension,Mark. 16.15. he bid them goe into all the world, &c. Now the preaching of the Gospell and meanes of saluation being thus vniuersall,  how is it, will some say, that grace is not receiued of many? The Papists answer, because they will not, say they: it lieth in man to giue con∣sent to the calling of the Gospell, by his free will, helped by grace: but this is meerely false; this ascribes a power to the will of a naturall man, which is in bondage vnder sinne and Satan, and must not only be helped, as if it had power in it selfe with some helpe to receiue grace, but must be de∣liuered from bondage, and changed before it can mooue it selfe to any thing that is good, as our Sauiour saith. No man can come vnto me,Ioh. 6.44. except the Father which hath sent me, draw him. Draw him, saith Augustine, not lead him, that we might thinke his will doth go before: for who is drawn if he were willing before? So then the true answer to the question is,  that though grace be vniuersally offered by the preaching of the Gospell, yet it is not receiued of many be∣cause together with the outward meanes there is not in all an inward concurrence & worke of Gods spirit: for as our Sauiour saith,Ioh. 6.45. Euery man that hath heard, and hath lear∣ned of the Father, commeth vnto me. They that are not inwardly taught of the father,  are ignorant, and come not, and hauing in themselues the cause of their ignorance,They haue great cause to blesse the Lord, who are inwardly taught of him are left without excuse. And this (see the vse of it) may minister great cause of thanksgiuing to God, to as many of vs as the Lord hath vouchsafed inwardly to teach, and to open our hearts as he did the heart of Lidia, to beleeue and obey the
Gospell. For why? haue not we great cause to magnifie the name of the Lord,Act. 16.14. who in mercy hath brought vs to the o∣bedience of faith, and in his secret yet iust iudgement, hath left others as good as we by nature, in hardnesse and sin? When we see others left in their naturall state and corrup∣tion, wee may behold in them what we had deserued, and how much we are boūd to the Lord, who in his iust iudge∣ment hath passed ouer others, and in his mercy hath deli∣uered vs out of our naturall bondage, and so be moued to acknowledge his mercy with thankfulnesse: and if any will stand to reason the case why the Lord doth not with the outward meanes giue inward grace to al, the Apostle hath giuen the answer: O man,Rom. 9 20. who art thou that standest to dis∣pute against God? he will haue mercy on whom he will: it is his meere mercy, that any man is brought to beleeue; and let that suffice thee. So much of the first argument of commendation of the Gospell, in these words, (which is come, &c.) Now to the second argument (is fruitful in all the world) for these words must be resumed and repeated, to make a perfect sentence: the Gospel is here said to be fruit∣full both generally in all the world, and in speciall among the Colossians in two respects. 1. in respect of the number of such as were conuerted daily &c. in respect of the belee∣uers, who by the preaching of it were daily increased, as we read there were added to the Church by the sermon of Pe∣ter about three thousand soules, and verse 47.Act. 2.41. it is said the Lord added to the Church from day to day such as should be saued. Secondly, in respect of the proceeding of those beleeuers, and of them that were conuerted in faith, san∣ctifie, and other graces. The original text in some examples hath two words, , which plainly shew that this word (fruitfull) seruing to expresse them both, hath this extension, to signifie both increase in num∣ber, and increase of faith and holy fruits, that the Gospell was fruitfull in conuerting many, and powerfull in them that were conuerted, both generally in all parts of the
world, and in speciall among the Colossians. That is the meaning of the words. Come we to such things as may be hence obserued. First, from the fruitfulnes of the Gospell, the powerfull working of it generally in all the world, that the preaching of it in the daies of the Apostles was vniuer∣sally fruitfull in all places of the world, in all sorts of men, in their conuersion, and other fruits, wee are taught, that where it pleaseth the Lord to worke by the Gospell, no∣thing is able to withstand the power and force of it. The  powerfull working of it in all parts of the world, in such varietie,Nothing is able to with∣stand the power and force of the Gospel, where the Lord is pleased to worke by it. if not contrarietie of states, both of gouernment and religion, such diuersitie of natures, wits, and dispositi∣ons, some being like wolues, some leopards, some lions, especially in the Empire of Rome, which then flourished, & in other mighty principalities, doth plainly proue that it is able to beare downe before it the wisdome, learning, policie, power, & strength of the world, and to cast downe whatsoeuer stands vp in opposition against it: for indeed it was withstood & resisted by all these things & many more in the daies of the Apostles in the primitiue times,Isay 11. as might be proued, yet had it maruellous successe, and did wonder∣fully increase, & for the state of religion it chāged the face of the whole world.Isay 53.1. 1. Cor. 1.18. The reason is giuen by the Prophet; It is the arme of the Lord: and by the Apostle; It is the power of God: the arme of the Lord hath euer preeminence, euer preuaileth, and nothing is able to withstand the power of it. Hence the Gospell hath beene and is so powerfull, it ha∣uing in it a power passing the power of man, yea passing the power and strength of hell, it must needs be effectuall, and nothing able to withstand it. And is this true in the ge∣neral working of the Gospell?  then learne we by this to ex∣amine the particular working of it proportionably in our selues,We are to ex∣amine the particular working of the Gospell in our selues. and know that then thou doest indeed embrace the Gospell, and then is it powerfull in thee, when nothing in thee by nature is able to withstand the power of it. When thou doest feele it ouer-ruling thine own reason, and bea∣ring
downe the rebellion of thy will and affections, and what sinne soeuer is most pleasing vnto thee Such persons deceiue themselues, who thinke they embrace the Gospel, and yet feele it not powerful to beare down (I will not say) their secret corruptions, for those may lurke in their hearts and be vnknowen, but their knowen sins, such as in their owne sight stand vp in opposition against the Gospell: for let this be thought vpon but in reason, can wee thinke that the Lords arme is powerfull where the deuils arme armed holds possession? Can wee imagine that the Lord hath wrought by his Gospell, where pride, couetousnesse, drun∣kennesse, malice, or any other shamelesse sinne doth stand vp and outface it, and is seene aboue any power of it? hath the Gospell in the primitiue times of the Church, nay in the memorie of many amongst vs, hath it beene powerfull to make men to forsake house, land, wife and children, yea to lose, forgoe their liues, by fire and fagot, and most ex∣quisite torments; and is it not now able to make thee to deny the lusts of thine own wicked heart? can it not make thee forsake so much as a cup of beere or wine, not need∣full? is it not able to make thee leaue thy vaine and carnall pleasure? is the Lords arme weakned? is the power of the Gospell abated? no, no; deceiue not thy selfe, the Gospell is as mighty as euer it was through God to cast downe the strongest holds of sinne and Sathan, as the Apostle saith.2. Cor. 10.4. Certainly, if the Lord haue wrought vpon thee by the Gospell, for thy conuersion and saluation, and not for thy hardning and deeper condemnation, by thy abusing of it, he hath thereby quelled and ouermastered the corrup∣tion of thy heart, throwen downe thy strongest and most rebelling sin, euen that sin that was most powerful & plea∣sing vnto thee. Let this be thought on and remembred. (as it is also.) Wee are heere to marke that the Apostle de∣scends from the generall working of the Gospell, to the particular: he saith it was fruitful in al the world, and there staies not, but addes further (as it is also among you) no
doubt both to commend and comfort the Colossians for their embracing of the Gospell: whence we may note how  wee may with profit and comfort thinke and speake of the fruitfull working of the Gospell;How we may with profit & comfort thinke and speake of the fruitfull wor∣king of the Gospell. namely, when wee know and can truly say, it is powerfull not onely in gene∣ral in the Church and land wherein we liue, but among vs, then may any man speake of the working of the Gospel, with comfort, when he can with the Apostle goe from the generall to the particular, and can truely say it is fruitfull in himselfe, many men are able to make long discourses in commendation of the power of the gospell, and by vnan∣swerable arguments to prooue the Apostles words true in generall termes, nay with instance and example of others sanctified by it, but can say little or nothing of the power of it, in their owne persons. Now what profit comes by it to know that the gospell is the power of God to the salua∣tion of many others, if it were of the whole world, and not of thy selfe? What comfort is it to know that many are brought by the gospell to the way of life, and thy selfe left in the way that leadeth downe to hell? nay rather what discomfort comes by such knowledge? To haue the eie of the mind blinded, and not be able to see & conceiue in the vnderstanding the power of the gospell, is an heauy iudge∣ment; but to see the power of it in the abstract in it selfe in generall, and not in our selues, that is the very deuils case, and it ought to be considered and thought vpon. Come we to the words following, wherein the speciall working of the Gospell among the Colossians is amplified, that it was fruitfull from the day that they heard, and truly or in truth knew the grace of God: the Gospell is heere called the grace of God, because it teacheth that remission of sins and life euerlasting are obtained onely by the meere grace and mercie of God in Christ. The point of instruction hence offered is this: In that it is said that the Gospell was fruitfull among the Colossians, vpon their hearing and true knowledge, not of the Gospell, but of the grace of
God propounded vnto them in the Gospell; we are taught that then onely is the Gospell powerfull to worke vpon vs,The Gospell is powerfull to make vs bring foorth good fruit, when wee haue a feeling knowledge of the comfort of it. Ps. 19.10.11.  to make vs bring foorth many good fruits, when wee truly know, and haue euen a feeling knowledge of the sweetnesse and comfort of it, when wee truly know and in our hearts feelingly apprehend the grace of God reuealed in the Gospell, then is the Gospell fruitfull, then doth it worke vpon vs to our sanctification. This order and man∣ner of proceeding, from a feeling of sweetnesse to fruitful∣nesse, we finde laid before vs by the Prophet Dauid: hee there saith that the iudgements of the Lord were sweeter than the hony and the hony combe; and then he addes, that by them he was made circumspect. We reade of the woman in the Gospell, that she loued much: why?Luk. 7 47. many sinnes were forgiuen her. When she felt much comfort in Gods grace for the pardon of many sinnes, then shee brought foorth many good fruits. And there is great reason for this, that the true knowledge of the grace of God in the gospell, should make vs fruitfull in euery good word and worke. For when wee feelingly know the grace of God reuealed in the gospell, then wee know wee are within the compasse of Gods speciall loue, wee are assured of his comfortable presence and protection, of our portion in his promise of life and saluation, of right and title to all the comforts and blessings belonging to the saints of God. How then can it be, but that the feeling knowledge of grace, the ground of such excellent com∣fort, should make vs fruitfull in all good things?  Why but will some say (it is obiected of the Papists) wee see the do∣ctrine of Gods free grace for remission of sinnes to bee a doctrine dispossessing mens hearts of all true loue to God and charitable affection towards men: it is true indeed, it was so in the daies of the Apostle, some turned grace into wantonnesse, and it is so still: so great is the corruption of mans degenerate nature, that many turne that precious doctrine of Gods grace into a pernitious indulgence and
licence to heape sinne vpon sinne,  but this is but an acci∣dental euent, not the proper effect of the doctrine of grace: and shall an accidentall euent hinder the course and sprea∣ding of such a cause, as properly brings foorth true loue both to God and men? God forbid. Would we then haue the Gospell preached powerfull to make vs bring foorth many good fruits?  then labour wee,We must la∣bour to haue a feeling knowledge of the grace of God pro∣pounded in the Gospell. Heb. 4.2. Ezekiel 33.32 Ioh. 4. as we heare it, so to haue a feeling knowledge of the grace of God propounded in the Gospell, and to haue our hearing mixed with faith, as the holy Ghost speakes. For surely we shall but heare as a pleasant song, as the Lord saith, nay we shall but cauill at it, till wee haue a feeling knowledge of the comfort of it. The woman of Samaria did but prattle with Christ, till he told her of her sinne, and brought her to a true sight of her sinne, then she humbled her selfe, and confessed her sinne. And after that, when she knew him to be a Prophet, and did acknowledge him to be the Messiah, then shee ran to fetch others vnto him, and said, vers. 29. Come and see a man which hath told me all things that euer I did: is not he that Christ? So wee shall but prattle of the Gospell, and make it but table talke, till wee be humbled in our selues, and haue a true knowledge and an inward feeling of the comfort of it. Let vs then labour to haue our hearts pos∣sessed with a feeling apprehension of the grace reuealed in the Gospell, and that will set our heads a worke as it did Dauids, to deuise if it be possible some retribution: and we shall finde, that as many of vs as haue a peculiar right and title to Gods grace, sealed vp in our heart by the spirit of Christ, it will make vs endeuour to be answerable to so strict a bond, in all cheerefull obedience and loue both to God and men. VER. 7. As ye also learned of Epaphras our deare fellow seruant, which is for you a faithfull minister of Christ. The Apostle hauing set downe the meanes how the
Colossians came to know that life and glory was laid vp for them in heauen (namely) by bearing of the Gospell. In this seuenth verse he comes to the person by whom the Gospell was preached, and they brought to that know∣ledge (namely) by Epaphras (As ye also learned of Epaphras) the Apostle further describes him what he was. First in re∣spect of himselfe and Timothie that in preaching of the Gospell he was their fellow laborer, and addes, what affe∣ction they had towards him, that he was deare vnto them, or that they loued him dearely, then by his office and cal∣ling that he was a minister of Christ, and he sets down how he demeaned himselfe in his calling, that he was faithfull, and that for the good of the Colossians (which is for you a faithfull minister of Christ) and further proues it verse the eight, that he was faithfull for their good in that hee gaue testimony of their loue (who hath also declared vnto vs your loue) which is amplified by the quality of it in the last words (which ye haue by the spirit) these be the generall things contained in these two verses. Come we to the words as they are laid downe by the Apostle (as ye also learned, &c.) we are hereto marke that the Apostle is not content to say, that the Colossians came to the knowledge of saluation by the Gospell, but that they also learned it of Epaphras, not that Epaphras was a meanes of himselfe or by any other doctrine, but that he was the preacher and dispenser of the Gospell, and by his preaching of the gos∣pell  brought them to that knowledge,The know∣ledge of sal∣uation, is or∣dinarily wrought in men by the Gospell prea∣ched by men called to that office. whence ariseth this instruction that the knowledge of saluation is ordinarily wrought in men, by the Gospell not by the letters, and sil∣lables or bare sentences written in the bookes of the old or new testament, but by the gospell taught and applied vn∣to them by the ministery of man called to teach, for the gospell is indeed the power of god to saluation, yet not to euery one generally, but to euery one that beleeueth that is the limitation, and how, is faith wrought by the bare let∣ter or sentence of the gospell? no, but by the gospell vnfol∣ded
and applied marke the gradation, how shall they be∣leeue in him,Rom. 10.14. of whom they haue not heard? and how shall they heare without a Preacher, for the working of faith, the Gospell must bee heard and not onely heard by a bare repetition of the sentence but heard preached, that is to say,2. Tim. 3.16. vnfolded and applied, the Scripture saith the A∣postle is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse, and marke what followeth vpon this in the next chapter 1. 2. verses, I charge thee therefore before God, and before the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing, and in his Kingdome. 2. Preach the word; be instant in season and out of season: im∣prooue, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. The Scripture being profitable in it selfe, it must bee preached and applied by men called to the seuerall vses of it, the sen∣tence of the Gospell is generall and the promises of salua∣tion are indefinitely propounded whosoeuer beleeueth he shall be saued, they are aboue the reach of naturall vnder∣standing, such as reason cannot comprehend, and gene∣rals of that nature must needs be vnprofitable without ex∣plication and application of them, the Lord therfore hath ordained that men called to teach the gospell, should in his name expound and applie the same to the persons of their hearers particularly, that so they might bee brought to the knowledge of Saluation. Ob.It will be sayd, the Prophet sayth, in the time of the Go∣spell, men should teach no more, euery man his neigh∣bour,Ier. 31.34. and euery man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them, vnto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: How then is it that the Gospell must bee taught by the ministery of man, how is that a true prophesie? The meaning of the Prophet is, that Gods elect in the time of the New Testament should not onely bee taught by the outward ministerie of the word, but inwardly by his spirit as appeares in the verse before. And the Prophet
speakes in regard of the plentifull measure of knowledge vnder the Gospell according to that,Isay. 11.9. that the earth should be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters that couer the sea. Some may reply and say,Reply. this answer is not sufficient, is the Prophet so to be vnderstood, that the Elect of God should be taught inwardly by his spirit, then Saint Iohn hath shewed it needlesse to be taught by man,1. Ioh. 2.27. the an∣noynting (that is to say) the spirit of Christ, which ye haue receiued of him, dwelleth in you: and ye need not that a∣ny man teach you: but the same annoynting teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and is not lying, and as it taught you, ye shall abide in him. Againe, the meaning of Saint Iohn is,  that the Elect ha∣uing receceiued the Spirit, need not that any man should teach them to discerne truth taught from errour and de∣ceipt, they are inwardly taught of the spirit, they haue their mindes enlightned, their iudgements cleered, and therefore he sayth ver. 26. these things haue I written vnto you, concerning them that deceiue you. And then hee sub∣ioynes in the seuenteenth ver. but the annoynting &c. So then notwithstanding these exceptions this remaines a truth, that men are brought to the knowledge of saluation not by the bare sentence of the Gospell deliuered in the writings of the Apostles, but by it explained and applied by men called to that office. Hath the Lord sanctified the ministery of man called to teach and apply the Gospell to such an excellency,  as by it to bring vs to a particular knowledge of our owne salua∣tion?We are not to thinke base of the mini∣stry and tea∣ching of the Gospell, by men called to that function. then let this serue to rule and order our conceit and and estimation of the ministery and teaching of the Go∣spell by men called to that duty and function, let vs not thinke it either needlesse or base. Who well in his wits & lead by the diuine light of reason will lightly regard, that which being rightly vsed will bring him to the knowledge of his owne euerlasting good. Such is the ministery and teaching of the Gospell, by men called to that function,
yea the teaching of the word by men cald to that office is ordaind of the Lord to make it profitable, what part of the word soeuer it be, whether the Law or the Gospell, let vs then take heed we contemne not the teaching of the word by men in any part of it, whether shewing sinne by the law and denouncing iudgements, or preaching mercy, and applying the promises of the Gospell; let vs not lightly e∣steeme it, because it is brought by a weake and mortall man, the Lords ordinance is powerfull in weaknesse as in the creation, hee brought light out of darkenesse and re∣redemption and life out of death, so in our conuersion he workes vpon vs by the ministery of weake men, and heer∣in he doth not onely prouide for our weakenesse, who are not able to endure the Maiesty of his owne immediate voice, or the voyce of an Angell, but to trie our obedience whether wee will looke onely at his instrument or at his ordinance, whether wee will haue our eye on the earthen vessell, or on the excellent treasure brought in that vessell, and therefore to lay this a little neerer vnto our hearts ma∣ny there be that will be content to looke at the Lords or∣dinance of the word brought by the ministery of men, when the word of grace and mercy is preached, they will then looke on that, as the word of God, and confesse, and acknowledge it so to be, and vpon a false ground hale it to themselues, but when the law is laid open, and the iudge∣ments of God denounced, then they heare and regard that but as the word of man and not of God, then they blesse themselues, and promise peace to themselues, and say in their hearts, no such things shall happen vnto them, it is but the word of their preacher. I appeale to mens owne hearts, whether these thoughts doe not many times rise in them or no, and if wee finde they doe, then marke what will follow, the Lord will punish vs, euen by our owne thoughts, that as we thinke his iudgements denounced by the ministery of man, to be but the words of men, and of our preachers, so hee will make his word of grace offered
by the ministerie of man to be vnto vs but as the word of man, we shall ot in our sinnes, and lie still vnconuerted, it shall be vnprofitable vnto vs, for the Lord is iust, and hee will punish sinne in the same kind, and as we thinke of his word of threatning, so shall his word of mercie be vnto vs. Consider the example of Herod:Mark. 6.20. hee heard many things Iohn taught him gladly, he heard them (no doubt) as the word of God by the ministery of Iohn, but when Iohn came to touch his sinne, and to tell him the danger of liuing in that sinne, he would none of that, he then thought it was but Iohns word, and so would be auenged of him, and so indeed all that he heard of Iohn was by the iust iudgement of God, but as mans word vnto him, he liued and died in his sinnes, so wil it come to passe with vs, if so be we thinke the iudgements of God denounced against vs for our sinnes in the ministerie of the word, are but the words of men. Learne we therefore in the ministery of the word by man cald to that office, to looke not at the instrument, but at the ordinance of God, & let vs receiue the word, as the word of God, whether threatning iudgements, or promi∣sing mercie. Now to the description of Epaphras. First, the Apostle saith hee was in respect of him and Timothie their deare fellow seruant; which words are thus to bee conceiued, that they did acknowledge him a fellow la∣bourer with them in the preaching of the Gospell, and consequently one dearely beloued of them. Now in that the Apostle saith Epaphras was his fellow  seruant & so deare to him & Timothie,Such as are lawfully knit together in a∣ny common bond, they are to be ten∣derly affected one to ano∣ther. hence we may con∣clude that such as are lawfully knit together in any cōmon bond, they are by the example of the Apostle tenderly to be affected one towards another: children of the same parents, seruants of one master, men of one society, neigh∣bours one to another, it is vsuall in the Scriptures to vrge and presse loue by this kind of reasoning, that men that are conioined by some common bond, they ought to loue one another. Abraham vsed this argument. Moses vsed no
other to accord the two Hebrewes.Act. 7.26. Sirs yee are brethren, why doe ye wrong one to another? We may obserue that when Iosephs brethren forgat him to be their brother,Gen. 37 20. or at least did not so consider him, they said, come let vs kil him. But after when they considered him as their brother, then they thinke of a more milde and gentle course, verse 27. Come and let vs fell him to the Ismaelites, and let not our hands be vpon him; for hee is our brother, and our flesh: and his brethren obeied. As the scripture thus vrgeth loue, so nature it selfe teacheth it, hauing imprinted in such as she hath conioined, a bending and an inclination one to∣wards another. And it was euer held odious among the heathen, and a growing out of kinde, for men in nature neerely conioined, to be farre disioined in affection. And is the bond of outward brotherhood, seruice, societie and neighbourhood, and such like, a perswasion and a power∣full argument vrging loue? then doubtlesse much more is the inward bond of the spirit, because by the spirit men are more neerly conioined, then they are or can be by nature. By the spirit they are made members of one mysticall bo∣die,  members of one another.Therfore such as professe fellowship and commu∣nion of the Spirit, are tenderly to loue one another. Rom. 12.5. Let this then be thought on by all that professe the fellowship and communion of the spirit. Let vs thinke vpon it, that we haue one God to our father, one Church to our mother, Christ our elder bro∣ther, and that we are borne of one immortall seed, that we are knit together in one faith, one religion, one hope of saluation, and therefore ought to loue one another. Come we to the other part of the description of Epaphras, that he was for the Colossians a faithfull minister of Christ. A minister being faith∣full in dis∣charging of his dutie, it is for the good of the people.Whence note wee first, that where a minister is faithfull in the discharge of his duty, it is for the good of the people, so saith the Apostle, (for you) that is, for your good: & this might be prooued by all the titles that are giuen to mini∣sters in the Scripture. They are called light, which is com∣fortable to the beholders, salt, for seasoning, labourers in the Lords husbandrie, builders of his Temple, leaders,
guides, &c. all which shew their labour and paines in the ministery, tend to the good of Gods people. But the expe∣rience of such as haue profited, by the paines of faithfull ministers may sufficiently confirme the trueth of this point. Now then is it so,  that a faithfull minister is for the good of the people,The people must answer the paines of the minister in profiting themselues. Heb. 6.8. then let vs looke where the minister is in any measure faithfull, that wee be answerable in profiting our selues and receiuing good, for as the holy ghost saith, that earth which drinketh in the raine, and beareth thorns and briers is reprooued, and is neere vnto cursing, whose end is to be burned. Consider yet further these two things. First, hardnesse and want of profiting in the people, is a great griefe and discouragement, and euen a pull-backe to a faithfull minister.Ier. 20 9. Witnesse Ieremy who resolued vpon this not to speake any more in the name of the Lord. Againe, if a minister be faithfull, and we profit not, it argues, we are sunke deepe in rebellion, euen drunken in sinne, yea sunke deepe into the sinne of drunkennesse; for of all others, drunkards are the hardest to be drawen to repentance: for as drunkennesse for the time of it makes a man like a bruit beast, vnfit for any common and naturall dutie, so it is the naturall effect of that sinne, to depriue a man (when he is sober) of all vnderstanding and capacitie of instruction. Therefore the Lord when hee was to call by his Prophet for a generall reformation, he spake in particular to drun∣kards, Awake ye drunkards,Ioel. 1.5. and weepe and howle all ye drinkers of wine. If then we would not hinder the paines of such as labor in the ministery amongst vs, and shew our selues sunke deep in rebellion, let vs labor to profit and to receiue good by them that labor for our good, and ende∣uour to profit vs. And remember the words of the holy Ghost; Obey them that haue the ouersight of you,Heb. 13.17. & sub∣mit your selues: for they watch for your soules, as they that must giue accompts, that they may giue it with ioy, and not with griefe: for that is vnprofitable for you. Now
in the next place we are to marke, that the Apostle in com∣mending Epaphras a minister of Christ, doth not magnifi and extoll him for his wit, his learning, his eloquence, h grauitie, but he commends him for his faithfulnesse, that he was faithfull, that is to say, hee did vse his talent and gif bestowed vpon him for the best aduantage, both of gai∣ning glory to Christ his Lord, and good to his people: fo that is to be faithfull,Mat. 25. as appeares in the parable of the ta∣lents.  Hence it followes that the chiefe ornament and that which most commends a minister of Christ,The chiefe ornament of a minister is to be faithfull in the execu∣tion of his of∣fice, and the like is ue of other callings 1. Cor. 4.2. in respect of the execution of his office, is to be faithfull, and to answer that trust that is reposed in him. As for the rest (that is to say) as for other things, or howsoeuer hee be carefull for other things, it is not so much materiall, but it is especially required of him that hee be found faithfull. And indeed it is required in euery dutie, that he be faithful in teaching, in exhorting, in comforting, in reprehending, it must be found in euery ministeriall action, without it nothing is pleasing to God profitable to men. And this not onely concerns the minister of the word, and is required of him, and to be vrged vpon him, but it may be reached out fur∣ther, and that by iust warrant of the word. The Apostle saith,Rom. 13.4. such as are ordained to rule and gouerne others, they are Gods ministers, they are appointed of the Lord, for the good of those that be vnder them, they haue a talent in trust giuen vnto them. Now then that which most com∣mends the minister of the word, is it not also praise wor∣thie, and most commendable in others, Gods ministers, such as are deputed of the Lord to haue the rule and go∣uernment of others? Yes doubtlesse, diligence and faith∣fulnesse in the charge cōmitted, either in Church or com∣mon wealth, as it is most requisite and necessarie, so it is most excellent and commendable, it is as a crowne that must be set on the head of all good duties. We read in ma∣ny places, of the vigilancie, care & diligence of Moses, that neither the difficultie and infinite labours of his calling,
the contumacy, vntowardnesse, and ingratitude of the peo∣ple, the emulation and grudging of equalls, did any whit hinder him from going on with courage and constancy in his duty: the Lord therefore himselfe with his owne mouth, giues him this commendarion.Numb. 12.7. That he was faith∣full in all his house, and that must needs be most commen∣dable which the Lord commends in any man. We find this commendation giuen to Christ himselfe, and that with greater glory vnto him then vnto Moses,Heb. 3.2. because he was a more excellent person. If we do but consider, how the diuell labours, to make men put in trust by the Lord with gifts and places of rule and gouernment, vnfaithfull, and not to answer the trust reposed in them, that so their condemnation may be the deeper, and that he may hin∣der the profit of others, who might be bettered by them: the truth of this will easily appeare that in any place of rule, it is most commendable to be faithfull, he by sugge∣stion teacheth men, as we see by experience to say (when they are vrged to doe their duty) what can I doe? I will not trouble my selfe? or make my selfe busie, it belongs not to my office it is good sleeping in a whole skinne, I shall be blamed, I shall be reproched, I shall labour in vaine, and peraduenture make the matter worse, another may doe it better then I, with a thousand such like suggestions, doth the diuell furnish men to make them sluggish and vnfaith∣full, all which plainly euince, that faithfulnesse in any place of trust is an excellent thing. And let this be thought on by all that are calld to any rule or gouernment of others either publikely or in the priuate family, parents, masters, houshold gouernors, &c. seeing it is so excellent a thing to be faithfull,  let it serue to stir them vp to answer that trust the Lord hath reposed in them,Men are to answer that trust the Lord hath reposed in them in any place and calling. to vse the place giuen them to bring such as are vnder them to feare the Lord, for that is in generall the charge that lies on gouernors and laid vpon them by the Lord in the fourth commandement, that they in their owne persons sanctifie the sabboth, and
learne to feare the Lord, and cause others vnder them to doe likewise. For want of faithfull discharge of duty in such as haue the gouernment of others, it comes to passe that many foule disorders spoken against are still vnrefor∣med, to insist in one particular. Though the minister crie out against drunkennesse, and spend himselfe in disswa∣ding from it, and good lawes be made for the reformation of it, yet still that sinne is as rife and common, nay more common then euer it was, where is the fault? is it not in such as beare office and should faithfully execute their office, according to law in that case prouided. Yes without question,Psal. 77.20. Moses and Aaron must ioyne hands together, the minister must bee seconded and assisted by the pub∣like officer, or else many there be that will not be re∣formed. To perswade such as are in any publike office, or haue the gouernment of priuate families to become faith∣full in labouring, to bring those that are committed to their charge, to feare the Lord, consider first that diligent faithfulnesse in the charge committed, is both sweet and pleasing to God,Pro. 22.29. and good for our selues. He that is dili∣gent standeth before Kings; but he that is diligent in the worke of the Lord, (such is euery publike charge) shall stand with ioy before the Lord,Mat. 25.21. the King of Kings. Come good and faithfull seruant, thou hast been faithfull in lit∣tle; I will make thee ruler ouer much; enter into thy masters ioy. To him that is slothfull the contrary shall be said. A∣gaine, let vs but thinke with our selues, how diligent the wicked are to do euill. Iudas will watch when others are asleepe, and that for a mischiefe. The high priests and all that rout assemble together betimes in the dawning against Christ,Matk. 15.1. euen before day will the wicked be working ill. They muse on mischiefe on their beds.Pro 4.16. And feare not to pull vpon themselues that woe denounced by the Prophet▪ They will rise early to call companions to follow after drunkennesse,Isay 5.11. and shall the wicked be thus diligent (if I may so call it) to doe ill, and shall it not moue such as the
Lord hath put in trust, to be vigilant and faithfull in well doing. Surely then their vigilancy and paines shal stand vp in iudgement against them, and shall condemne them. Adde to this as a third motiue, that which we find. Where the Lord saith he will not hide from Abraham that which he was about to doe, and why?Gen. 18.19. for I know him that he will command his sons, and his houshold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, to do righteousnesse and iudg∣ment. See how the Lord liketh carefulnesse of parents, to instruct their children, it is so pleasing vnto him that he will reueale his secrets vnto them that vse it, and hide no∣thing that may be for their comfort. On the contrary from such as are carelesse of this duty, he will hide his se∣crets, his councels, yea without repentance, all his com∣forts, and the light of his countenance for euer. Let these things be thought on, and stir vs vp to faithfulnesse in any place of rule and gouernment. VER. 8. Who hath also declared vnto vs your loue, which ye haue by the Spirit. Come we to the eight verse, where the Apostle proues that Epaphras was faithfull for the good of the Colossians, because he gaue testimony of their loue. To omit other acceptions, the words are thus to be vnderstood that E∣paphras made knowne to Paul and Timothie what loue the Colossians bare vnto them (for he spake of all their loue to al the Saints before, vers. 4.) and the words carry this sence; which ye haue being far from vs in body, that you doe in∣wardly affect vs in soule and spirit, though you be far di∣stant from vs in body and that the word (spirit) is somtimes thus taken, appeares cap. 2. of this Epistle ver. 5. though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit. Here first we are to marke that the Apostle commends Epaphras for reporting vnto him how the Colossians lo∣ued him and Timothie, which may minister this instructi∣on:
that it is an excellent vertue for such as haue inter∣course and passe betweene partie and partie, to relate and speake of things that may engender, and encrease true mu∣tuall loue and Christian affection betweene them, thus did Epaphras, he no doubt made knowen to the Colossians, what an excellent Apostle Paul was, againe hee declared to him, what loue the Colossians bare vnto him, to stirre him vp in affection towards them, hence it is that we finde it among the vertues of speciall note,Phil. 4.8. to thinke and speake of things that pertaine to loue: will we see a reason of this it is soone giuen, any man may easily conceiue it, if he do but consider as he ought the excellency of true Christian loue amongst men, it being that which is driuen at in all commandements of the second table, and that which makes all good duties profitable and good to our bre∣thren,1. Cor. 13. as the Apostle prooues at large, and loue being thus excellent, surely the speaking of such things, as tend to the furtherance and encrease of it, mutually amongst men must needs bee a speciall vertue and a worthy grace of a good Christian.  This being so, that to report such things. as may engender,Carrying of tales between parties is a notable vice. Pro. 26.20. and encrease loue, is an excellent vertue. Then the contrary to this to carry such tales and reports betweene parties which are as wood to the fire, to stirre vp strife, to set men at ods and difference, cannot choose but be a notable vice, and the very character and badge of a lewd person, and a fault too common in the world, some there be who make tale telling so common a practise, as there is not an honest man or woman that hath not some time or other beene wounded by the stroake of the ran∣ging tongue of the tale-bearer; but let such as are guiltie of this sinne, consider the vglinesse of it, let them consider beside this, that it is the property of a vile nature, to seeke by tales to make others vile, that it is the very bane and poyson of friendship, and the cut-throat of amity, a de∣gree of murder,Ezech. 22.9. so sayth the Lord that in Ierusalem were men that carried tales to shed bloud. Let them I say fur∣ther
consider thē reach of this sinne, it reacheth not onely to the killing of the bodies, but of the soule of ma∣ny at one blow; wee say, it is a shrewd blow that killes three at once. Now the tale-teller (without Gods mer∣cie) killes his owne soule, and peraduenture the soules of twenty more,Psal. 12.3. who rashly vpon the hearing of a false tale condemne the innocent, the Lord therefore stirred vp the spirit of Dauid, to pray that God would root out all de∣ceitfull lippes. If these things bee thought on, they are sufficient to breede in a heart not giuen ouer to it selfe, a detestation of this sinne, and let vs take heed, the Diuell deceiues vs not in this case, for hee will force this vp∣pon vs vnder many faire pretences, as that wee are sorrie that our neighbours hath done so, that we speake not of malice, nor all wee could speake. Let vs beware of this subtilty, and learne to auoyd this sinne. From the last words (which ye haue by the spirit) the  poynt briefly is this,True belee∣uers loue one another though they see not the face one of another. that true beleeuers loue one another though they neuer see the face one of another, which ar∣gues true loue not rising from any outward thing, either pleasure or profit, the ground of this, is their vnion with Christ, for they that are one with Christ, cannot but bee one in heart among themselues, how farre distant soeuer they bee one from another in bodie: and let vs heereby trie our loue to the Saints of God,  if wee bee affe∣cted towards them,We are here∣by to trie our loue to the Saints of God. 1. Ioh. 3.14. of whom wee heare well and yet ne∣uer saw them, if wee loue them as heartily as our owne sonne or brother, then our loue is true spirituall loue, and a testimony of our adoption. Wee know that wee are translated from death to life, because wee loue the bre∣thren.
VER. 9. For this cause wee also since the day we heard of it, cease not to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will, in all wise∣dome and spirituall vnderstanding. The Apostle hauing finished the first part of the preface of this Epistle, his congratulation or reioycing for the Co∣lossians.The second part of the preface of this Epistle, the A∣postles com∣precation. In this ninth verse, he comes to the second part, his comprecation or prayer for them, which is laid down in the ninth, tenth, and eleuenth verses. In this ninth verse, he first sets downe the moouing cause, what moo∣ued him to pray, namely, the same that mooued him to giue thankes, (for this cause &c.) together with the conti∣nuance of his prayer, that from the day, he heard of their faith and loue, he continued to pray for them, and then further hee makes knowen in what manner hee prayed, namely with desire, after that followes the matter of his prayer, that they might be fulfilled with knowledge, which knowledge is limited by the obiect, namely the will of God, and further amplified by two speciall things, where∣in it doth consist, namely, wisdome and vnderstanding, and both these spirituall. These be the parts of this ninth verse. Touching the words not to say any thing of the moouing cause, that stirred the Apostle to pray for the Colossians, hauing spoken of that, in verse the third, nor yet of the continuance of his prayer, that he ceased not to pray for them. The first thing that we may hence obserue, is, that prai∣er is a speciall meanes to helpe vs forward,Prayer is a special means for the in∣crease of our spirituall knowledge. and to make vs encrease in knowledge and spirituall vnderstanding. The Apostle thought it not sufficient to write vnto the Colossi∣ans and to labour with them by instruction and exhorta∣tion to confirme them in the true faith, but he further saith he ceased not to bee instant with the Lord in prayer for them, that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of his
will, whence it followes that prayer, not onely of others, but of vs for our selues, is a notable means for the encrease of our spirituall knowledge,Iam. 1.5. this is taught most plainely if any man lacke wisedome, if any hauing a small measure of wisdome find an emptines, a defect and want of wisdome and knowledge (as no man but shall if he be able to sift his owne braine) and would haue a supplie, let him aske of God which giueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it shall be giuen him. The reasons of this are these: first, it is a confessed truth, that the knowledge of Gods will reuealed in his word, comes by illumination of the spirit of Christ in whose power it is to open and shut the booke of God at his pleasure. Wee are not able of our selues, to vnderstand the plainest things deliuered in the word.Luk. 11.13. Now the spirit of grace and illumination is obtai∣ned by the prayer of faith: so saith our Sauiour, if ye which are euill, can giue good gifts vnto your Children, how much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Ghost to them that desire him? Whence it followeth ne∣cessarily that prayer is a speciall meanes for the encrease of knowledge. Againe true prayer, the praier of faith is not onely a meanes to fit, to prepare and to sanctifie out hearts to receiue grace; but euen the very action of praier, though it doe not merit, yet doth it encrease in some particulars, a further measure of grace and sanctification: for example, true prayer for the pardon of sinne worketh greater care to auoyd sinne, it is not possible that a man should make a plaine and hearty confession of any sinne to God in prayer and desire him to pardon it and promise amendment, but that by the very confession he should be bettered and fur∣ther off from that sinne: Hence it is that our Sauiour saith, watch and pray, that ye enter not into tentation:Mat. 26.41. that hee may be strengthened and better able to withstand temptation. So then, prayer being a meanes to fit, and prepare our hearts to receiue grace, and the very action of prayer en∣creasing a further measure of grace, in some particulars, it
must needs be a notable meanes for the encrease of spiri∣tuall knowledge. For the vse  of this, let vs thinke of it to this speciall pur∣pose,When we come to the hearing of the word we are to prepare our selues by prayer. when we are to come to the hearing of the word to be further informed in the way of God, remember we then to prepare our selues by praier to lift vp our hearts in ear∣nest and hearty praier vnto God that the eies of our minds may be opened, that we may rightly vnderstand things deliuered, and that our wills and affections may be trans∣formed into an holy obedience to the will of God made knowne vnto vs: for certainly it is a true speech one hath, though God himselfe should appeare in the likenesse of man and speake vnto vs, yet if he did not also moue and direct vs by his inward grace his preaching would be vn∣profitable vnto vs. We are therefore by praier to craue the assistance of his spirit. Many neuer thinke of this duty, many of vs either lie securely bathing our selues in our beds till the instant time of comming to the publike assembly, or else if we rise it is either to follow after worldly affaires, or to tricke and trim vp our bodies, and few or none of vs haue any care to fit and prepare our selues to sanctifie our soules before we come to the hearing of the word, but we come laden with our sinnes and with our minds ouerchar∣ged with diuerse lusts, and so it comes to passe that the speech of the Apostle is verified vpon vs,2. Tim. 3.7. that we are euer learning and yet neuer able to come to the sound know∣ledge of the truth. And how can it otherwise be, but that as many of vs as come without preparation by praier shold be vnfit to attaine sound knowledge, for so comming we rashly presume we can vnderstand Gods mysteries by the strength of our owne wits, and so are iustly confounded, and ouerwhelmed with the maiesty and brightnesse of them; Againe we must know, that praier is to the soule as exercise to the body, and as men vse exercise of the body, especially before meat to stir vp naturall heate to quicken the spirits, and to sharpen the stomacke, so praier must be
vsed before we come to the feeding of our soules to stir vp spirituall motions in our hearts, and to worke in vs an holy appetite and desire after the word, an hunger and thirst after the heauenly food of our soules; as men for want of bodily exercise, sit sometimes at a table wel furnished with good and wholesome meat, and yet can eat little or no∣thing; so we shall finde, that for want of preparation, by the exercise of praier, many sit before the Preacher, and are not able to taste or feele any true sweetnesse in any thing laid before them, nay they are heauy and sluggish, and vnfit to receiue any good. Remember therfore before we come to the hearing or the word, to lift vp our soules in praier to God, and euen to stretch out the faculties and powers of our soules, as men in bodily exercise stretch out the ioints of their bodies, we shall thereby no doubt finde and feele a great alteration in our soules, that they are more quicke and ready to receiue heauenly nourishment. Come we now to the manner of the Apostles praier in re∣spect of his inward affection, that he praied with desire. In that he saith, he did not only pray for the Colossians,  but desire that they might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding,True praier must be with inward fer∣uencie and desire of the heart. wee are taught that true praier must be with inward feruencie, with an holy sanctified desire of the heart. Praier must be rather a trauell of the heart, then a labour of the lips. Hence it is said to be a powring out of the soule,1. Sam. 1.15. Psal. 141.2. and com∣pared to incense: to note vnto vs, that it must be offered vp as it were by fire, it must proceed from the heat of the heart, that it may be a sweet smelling sacrifice to God. It is to be marked, that our Sauiour saith not, whatsoeuer yee pray for, but whatsoeuer ye desire when ye pray, beleeue that yee shall haue it, and it shall be done vnto you. And that praier must be with an inward desire, it appeares euen by the Lords manner of dealing with his children,Mark 11.24. who vseth meanes to whet and sharpen their desires, sometimes by deferring to grant their requests. Thus hee dealt with
Moses: The Lords purpose was to spare the people: yet when Moses praied for them,Exod. 32. the Lord said, ver. 10 Let me alone. And sometimes by afflicting of them: thus he dealt with Dauid.Psal. 42.4. When I remembred these things, I powred out my very heart because I had gone with the multitude, and led them into the house of God, with the voice of sin∣ging and praise, as a multitude that keepeth a feast. And the Lord vsing thus to deale with his children, doth plainly euince and proue the doctrine deliuered. We see our duty: let vs now a little examine our practise. And because it will not be sufficient to take a view of it in generall,We are to ex∣amine our selues how we pray. and to shew that men powre out their praiers on∣ly of forme and fashion, without any sanctified dispositi∣on, or holy desire of their hearts; let vs insist in one parti∣cular, wherby we may easily see how men faile in this duty and do not pray as they ought, with a true inward desire of their hearts: the thing is this, men sometimes pray vnto God, that they may abstaine from some knowen sinne, a sinne wounding and wasting their consciences, and they seeme to pray with desire that they may abstaine from it, but the euent many times shewes the contrary; for they finde no fruit of their praiers, it vanisheth, and they lie still in that sinne vnreformed. For example, a man giuen to cu∣stomarie swearing, being told of it, and reproued for it, he will sometimes lift vp his voice in praier, and say, I pray God giue me grace to leaue it, which is a good speech, and a speech bearing shew of inward desire to leaue that sinne, but indeed many times there is no such matter, for he still forgets himselfe, and oathes are still common with him. But wil some say,  it seemes to me, and I perswade my selfe when I say, God giue me grace to leaue my sinne, that I haue a desire in my heart to leaue it; will you sit in iudge∣ment vpon my conscience? tell me then, I pray you, how I shall know that my desire of grace and strength against sinne is no true sanctified desire?  I answer, I take not vpon me to sit in iudgement vpon thy conscience, let the word
iudge that and from thence I dare be bold to tel thee, that thy desire is no true desire, when it is only a bare desire, when it ceaseth and is at an end so soone as it is vttered, & thou hast no further care to vse other sanctified means, to helpe and strengthen thee against thy sinne, as hearing, reading, and meditating on the threatnings and iudge∣ments of God against that sinne.Num. 23.10. For thus it was with Ba∣laam he desired to die the death of the righteous; but his desire was no sooner vttered, but it was at an end: hee had no care to liue a sanctified life, that leads to a blessed and comfortable death. Such as pray for grace and strength a∣gainst sinne with a true sanctified desire, they ioine to their desire, the holy vse of other meanes, and their desire is not flitting & vanishing, but constant, and they giue the Lord no rest till he grant their desire, yea they vse vehement and vrging arguments to the Lord, to moue him to grant it; they vrge the former fauour and mercie of God in helping them against other sinnes: they pray that the Lord will not suffer their enemie Satan to ouercome them: they presse the Lord with his promise, Aske and you shal haue, seeke and you shall finde. Thus it is with them that haue a true sanctified desire of grace and strength against sinne. And to stirre vp our dulnesse in this case, consider we, first that praier without a true desire of the heart is meere moc∣kerie, & cannot escape vnpunished, the Lord denounceth a woe against it. Againe,Hosea 7.14. praier sent out from a true desire of the heart, and offered vp in Christ, is pleasing to God, yea though it be but a desire true and heartie, when the voice faileth, yet then it pierceth the clouds. Looke on the example of Hannah: Shee spake in her heart,1. Sam. 1.13. her lips did moue only, but her voice was not heard; and the Lord heard her: And vpon the example of Hezechiah:Isay 38, 14. Like a Crane did he chatter, yet the Lord heard his praier. And this is both a notable comfort, and also a notable induce∣ment to stir vs vp to powre out our praiers, with an inward feruencie, and with an holy desire of our hearts. Now to
the matter of the Apostles praier in the words following (that they might be fulfilled with knowledge in all wise∣dome and spirituall vnderstanding) with the limitation in respect of the obiect, the wil of God. The words carry this sense, that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge, that is to say, that ye might increase in knowledge, and come to that measure the Lord hath appointed necessary for sal∣uation,Ephes. 4.7. (for some of the members of Christ haue one mea∣sure, some another, according to that) yet euery one so much as is necessarie to saluation, which the Apostle here praied for (of his will) that is the will of God reuealed tou∣ching things to be beleeued & practised.Credenda & sacienda. Now in that the Apostle lifts vp his praier to God, for the Colossians, and desired of him, that they hauing some measure of know∣ledge  might receiue increase of it, we may conclude, that not only the beginning,Both the be∣ginning and further mea∣sure of illumi∣nation is the free gift of God. but a further measure of illumi∣nation and vnderstanding of Gods will, is the free gift of God, it is the Lords bountie and largesse, it comes vnto vs as alms to beggars, freely, it is gotten by earnest intreating and suing for, at the hands of God, yet not for the merit of any intreatie, as the beggar gets not his almes for the worthinesse of his crauing, but of the meere bounty of the giuer. So wee get increase of knowledge from the meere mercy of God, and in greater or lesse measure according to the good pleasure of the Lord. The Apostle saith, that the spirit distributeth his gifts as he will,1. Cor. 12.11. the distribution of the gifts of Gods spirit is voluntary, therefore free, and the vn∣equall distribution of the gift of knowledge, in that some haue a greater measure of knowledge then others, is a clear proofe that the increase comes from the meere bounty of the Lord, not from respect had of any thing in vs; for if the Lord should giue a different measure of knowledge, not freely, but vpon desert, then in all likelihood they who haue a greater measure of faith, should haue a greater mea∣sure of knowledge, but wee may many times obserue the contrary, that they haue more knowledge, who haue a lesse
measure of Faith, yea sometimes they who haue no sauing faith, haue such a measure of knowledge as they are able to prophesie:Mat. 7.22. therefore both the beginning and the increase of our knowledge of the will of God is the free gift of God. Let this teach vs,  if it please the Lord to giue vs any in∣sight,Hauing some knowledge of Gods will re∣uealed in his word, wee must not thinke that we are able to come by the strength of our owne will. any little knowledge of his will reuealed in his word not to be lift vp in conceit of our owne wit, as if then wee were able to goe on by our owne strength, if we doe, wee shall finde a curse vpon our wits, and by them we shall bee led into many erroneous opinions. If we obserue it wee shall finde this hath beene the mother of many fowle and dangerous errours, when men hauing some generall illu∣mination, some knowledge of Gods will reuealed haue then thought themselues able to goe on by the strength of their owne wit, they haue beene left to themselues and then haue runne into many errours, witnesse the best lear∣ned among the Papists who resting on a conceit of their schoole subtilties and distinctions inuented by their own wits haue runne into most grosse and palpable absurdities, & haue stiffely and obstinately stood in defence of them, we must therefore learne, in going on in the knowledge of Gods will not to rest on the strength of our owne wits, but vpon the blessing of God vpon them, vse the benefit of wit and vnderstanding in humility, for wit in it selfe is no cause of wandering out of the way, into by-paths of errour and heresie. Moses, Daniel, and Dauid had excellent wits, but they were humbled and sanctified, and so great helpes vnto them, it is not wit in it selfe, but our proud conceipt of wit, and too much resting in the seat of reason, which makes vs runne into errour, for that will not suffer vs to subiect our selues to the simplicity of the word of God, we must therefore take heed of it. In the second place, in that the Apostle in the fourth verse gaue testimony of the faith of the Colossians, and now prayed for the encrease of their knowledge of the will of God. We learne that such as truly beleeue in Christ, and are
able to testifie their faith to others,True belee∣uers being a∣ble to testifie their faith to others, may want know∣ledge of some things reuea¦led in the word of God. Matth. 16. yet haue their want of knowledge of the will of God, and may bee ignorant of some things reuealed, the Lord giues them not a full mea∣sure of knowledge at the first, but onely some degree which is afterward encreased. Thus our Sauiour dealt with his Apostles, when they had confessed, that he was the Christ the sonne of the liuing God, yet they knew not, the arti∣cles of his death and resurrection, it is therefore sayd ver. 21. from that time foorth, Iesus beganne to shew vnto his disciples, that he must goe vnto Ierusalem, and suffer ma∣ny things of the Elders, and of the high Priests, & Scribes and bee slaine, and rise againe the third day. Wee read though Apollos was an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures which did argue an excellent measure of know∣ledge,Acts. 18. yet he had his want of knowledge: euen two of his Auditours, Aquila and Priscilla, as we finde verse 26. took him home with them, and expounded the way of God more perfectly vnto him, yea Saint Paul testified of him∣selfe, that hee might encrease in comfort and strength of faith, by the faith of the Romans. Now the reason why the Lord giues knowledge vnto vs by degrees,Rom. 1.12. is this, be∣cause though a mans minde enlightned and sanctified, be of great capacity and will receiue a great measure of know∣ledge, yet it is able to receiue but little at once, it is like a violl, or a glasse, with a narrow mouth, that must haue water or some other liquid matter, put into it, droppe after droppe.Mark. 4.33. Hence it is sayd, that our Sauiour preached the word vnto the people as they were able to heare and vn∣derstand it. And is it so, that the Lord giues the knowledge of his will, by degrees,Wee must come to re∣ceiue know∣ledge of the will of God by degrees. by little and little, then let euery one of vs looke so to receiue it, let euery one attend with dili∣gence on the ordinance of God, the preaching of his word the ordinary meanes of knowledge, and let him looke to receiue knowledge of the will of God by degrees, one measure after another, or one measure vnto another, for
we must retaine and hold things heard and learned, and adde vnto them euery time, we heare, further measure of knowledge, otherwise we cannot look to be fulfilled with knowledge, as the Apostle here prayed, a vessel that hath a narrow mouth and an hole in the bottome euer open, can neuer be fild by powring water into it: no more can our mindes bee filled with knowledge, being hard to receiue, and hauing no retentiue faculty, no power to retaine things heard, and learned, but as fast as they are powred in they runne out, and passe away without profit, a fault that doth rest vpon many hearers of the word, who heare ma∣ny things and happily vnderstand and receiue them with ioy for the present, but after a while become forgetfull hea∣rers, as Iames 1.25. and let slip the things they haue heard, as if they had neuer heard them, these cannot come to the hearing of the word, to be further filled because they haue nothing but emptinesse in them, the things former∣ly receiued are gone, they are like the mill turned about daily but with new water, well let such loose and wretch∣lesse hearers consider, that it is not the hearing, the bare vnderstanding, nor the delight for the present, but the power of the doctrine of the word remaining in vs, that shall saue our soules, by forgetting and letting slip out of our mindes good things receiued:Reuel. 3.3. we decline and decay in all good duties, the Lord therefore perswadeth with the Church of Sardi, to recouer herselfe from her declining, by remembring and holding fast things receiued, the ho∣ly Ghost sayth that wee ought diligently to giue heed to the things which wee haue heard, least at any time,Heb. 21.2. wee should let them slip, and marke the waight of his reason following, strengthened by comparison, if the word spo∣ken by Angels (that is to say the Law) was stedfast, and e∣uery transgression, and disobedience receiued a iust re∣compence of reward how shall wee escape if we neglect so great saluation, that is to say the Gospell, which at the first beganne to be preached by the Lord; which we doe when
we let slip the things wee haue heard, and so wee bring on our selues punishment proportionable to the excellency of the Gospell and the first preacher of it Christ Iesus. One thing more may be noted from these wotds, name∣ly this that it is not a small measure of knowledge of the will of God,A small mea∣sure of know∣ledge of the will of God, will not serue to diuert vs in the way to saluation. Phil. 1.9. that must direct vs in the way to life and sal∣uation. The Apostle therefore heere prayes that the Co∣lossians might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will, in all wisdome and spirituall vnderstanding, and this I pray, that your loue may abound yet more and more, in know∣ledge. and in all iudgement. One speciall reason of this, is because the knowledge of Gods will must not onely guide vs in particular actions of life which are innumera∣ble: but must guide the inward motions of the mind, will and affections which are most wayward, and hard to bee brought into subiection to any good, for a man may be a∣ble sometimes to bridle himselfe in outward actions, but not to restraine the thoughts of his heart. Let vs not therefore content our selues with a smatte∣ring and a generall knowledge of Gods will reuealed.We must not content our selues with a smattering knowledge of God will reuealed. A man in his trade will not content himselfe with small skill if he be able to reach further, and shall wee then rest con∣tented with a little, and small measure of knowledge of Gods will reuealed in his word. Looke how much know∣ledge we haue of Gods will, so much knowledge haue wee of God himselfe and of our owne saluation, because God reuealeth himselfe and the meanes of Saluation in the word, and without the knowledge of that, there is no knowledge of God or of saluation. They that know not God in some measure the will of God reuealed in his word cannot know God, and so cannot know Gods mercy for their owne saluation, for if we know not God, God will neuer know vs to our comfort, therefore let vs not con∣tent ourselues with a small measure of knowledge of Gods will reuealed in his word, but labour daily for a greater measure and encrease. In the last words of this verse the
Apostle sets downe two things wherein the knowledge of Gods will doth consist, namely wisedome, and vnder∣standing and both spirituall. The word wisdome hath ma∣ny acceptions in the Scripture, sometimes it is put to sig∣nifie an euill quality,2. Sam. 14.2. the wisedome of the world properly called craft and subtilty, sometimes it is taken in a good sence and then also diuersly, as sometimes to signifie the doctrine of wisedome, sometimes the habit or quality of wisedome in the word,1. Cor. 2.6. and so it is taken in this place be∣cause it standeth heere in relation to the will of God, and by it is meant, an ability or power of the minde aboue nature, whereby the minde being cleared and disburdened of naturall dulnesse, vnbeliefe, ignorance and vanity, is a∣ble soundly and truely to apprehend, to acknowledge and embrace the known truth of the word of God as the Lord saith on the contrary,Ier. 8.9. they haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wisedome is in them? though they had the law amongst them ver. 8. yet because they did not truely apprehend and beleeue it, they are sayd to reiect it, and consequently had no wisedome in them, whence it is cleare, that when wee are wise in the knowledge of the will of God, when we truely apprehend, acknowledge and embrace the knowen truth of his word. The word (all) doth not signifie all kinde of wisedome, but a full measure of spirituall wisedome necessary to saluation.1. Cor. 13.2. So we find the word vsed, all faith, that is not all kindes of faith, iusti∣fying faith is not there meant, but a full measure of faith of working miracles. For the word (vnderstanding) not to say any thing of the distinction of it into the Theoricall and practicall, by that word is meant, an ability and pow∣er whereby the minde is able to apply the knowen truth of the word, to the good ordering both of particular in∣ward affections and outward things and actions, as time,1. Kin. 3 9. place and person shall require. Thus Solomon prayed, that God would giue him an vnderstanding heart, or vnder∣standing, whereby the affections of his heart might be or∣dered
and hee might be able to iudge and discerne truely betweene good and bad in particular causes and contro∣uersies, and giue sentence accordingly. Now both these, wisedome and vnderstanding, must bee spirituall, that is, wrought in vs by the spirit of Christ, on whom resteth the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisedome and vnderstan∣ding, the spirit of councell and strength, the spirit of know∣ledge,Isay. 11.2. and of the feare of the Lord: thus then are these words to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had sayd in a suf∣ficient true and sound apprehension of the truth reuealed in the word of God, and in a particular application of the same, to the good ordering of all particular affections of your hearts, and the actions of your liues, as the circum∣stance of time, place and person shall require wrought in you by the spirit of Christ. Now in that the Apostle cals knowledge of the will of God,They are tru∣ly wise, who rightly con∣ceiue, ac∣knowledge & embrace the truth of the word of God: Psal. 119 98.99.100. standing in true apprehension of the truth reuealed in his word, wisdome, we are taught, that they indeed are truely wise, who rightly conceiue, acknowledge and em∣brace the truth of the word of God, they who haue an eye vpon the word, and see the truth of that for their guide in all things, and are able to gouerne themselues wisely, both in respect of inward affection and outward action. Hence it was that Dauid sayd, that by the commandements of God, hee was wiser then his enemies. Had more vnder∣standing then his teachers and the ancient: and no mar∣uell, though it was thus with Dauid. There is reason to lead vs to thinke, that those who vnderstand, what the will of the Lord is, are most wise and indeed truely wise; first, because the will of the Lord made knowen in the word, is the wisedome of the Lord reuealed, manifesting such things, as the wisedome of flesh and bloud cannot reach vnto: Therefore they who are able by a supernaturall light to conceiue things contained in that, must needs be most wise, according to the nature of the things vnderstood, as they who are able to conceiue, and carry in minde the
best rules of pollicy, are iustly accounted most politicke. Againe, they must needs be most wise, who are enabled to prouide for their owne good estate, and that for euer, such are they who truly conceiue and embrace the truth reuea∣led in the word, for that is able to make wise to the King∣dome of God and eternall saluation.2. Tim. 3.15. Obiect. Luk. 16.8. Some may say, we read that our Sauiour saith, that the children of this world, are in their generation wiser then the children of light, enlightned by the spirit of God: how then is it true that they are most wise who rightly conceiue and embrace the truth of the word of God? For answer,  we must make the restraint of our Sauiours speech. He sayth not in generall that they are wiser then the children of light: but with a limitation hee restraineth their wisedome to their owne generation, to the things of this world, that in respect of them they are wiser: againe, if this speech runne thus, in their generation, then the children of light in theirs, he speakes as it commonly fals out, that the children of this world in their generation, are wiser, then the children of light in theirs, not because the world is not able to make them wiser, then the children of the world, but because of our corruption, we commonly reach not to that measure of wisedome we ought to doe, and so this makes nothing against the truth of the conclu∣sion deliuered, that they are truly wise who rightly con∣ceiue and embrace the truth of the word of God, for in that they reach not that measure of wisedome which they ought, it is in respect of their corruption,  and the remain∣der of sinne in them. Would we then (for vse of this) be truly wise (no doubt euery one desires it) would wee haue that wisedome,They that would be tru¦ly wise, must labour to know ac∣knowledge & embrace the truth of Gods word. that will make vs wise to eternall happinesse? then labour wee rightly to conceiue, acknowledge and embrace the truth reuealed in the word of God, that is the wisedome of God, and able to make vs wise and prouident for our eternall good. And to lead vs on in this, consider we but this one
thing, many men in the world, carrie a great shew of wise∣dome, and indeed they are wise in their kinde, but they wanting this (if we obserue it) we shall finde that the Lord doth catch and confound them in their wisedome, and as he dealt with Achitophell, he turnes their plots and deuices into foolishnesse. Nay which is more familiar and easie for vs to obserue, wee shall finde that some that are renow∣ned for wisdome in the world and yet want this wisedome from the word; they some way or other discouer them∣selues, to be but starke fooles, for consider it, doe not wee see many times such as are able to speake well and wisely and to giue good councell to others, and to manage their owne outward affaires with some good discretion, that they notwithhanding are tainted and stained with some notorious sinne, yea they are very monsters in the out∣rage of sinne; are not the wisest men of this world, many times grinding vsurers, extortioners, oppressours, greedy cormorants, hard dealers with their brethen, such as de∣fraud poore labourers of their hire, yea are they not some∣times Ale-house and Tauerne-haunters, whore-hunters and such like. If wee looke into the world wee may easily obserue it, that one way or other they discouer the weake∣nesse of that wisedome, the world doth so much admire in them, the Lord doth punish the pride of their wisedome with some foule sinne, and doth suffer them to yeeld to the subtilty of Satan, and deceipt of sinne, to make know∣en their folly by their sinne, he doth paint out their folly in their faces, and set a Nouerint vniuersi vpon them, and be it knowen to all men, that these whom you accompt iolly wise men, behold they are meere fooles. This must serue to teach vs and to stirre vs vp, not to rest in such kind of wisedome, as is found in the men of this world, but seek after that which is deriued from the word and so from God himselfe the fountaine of all true wisedome. We are further to marke that the Apostle in this place, ioynes wisedome and vnderstanding together. Whence it fol∣lowes
for our instruction; that it is not enough for vs to  conceiue and acknowledge the truth of Gods will,It is not suffi∣cient to vn∣derstand and take notice of Gods will, but it must be applyed to our particular occasions. either commanding duty, promising mercy or threatning iudge∣ment, but we must apply it to the ordering of our liues in particular actions, for as the knowledge of Gods will is brought vnto vs, by the ministery of the word, not onely in the information of our vnderstanding and iudgement but in the vse of instruction in the way of righteousnesse and reformation of corruptions, both of heart and life, so it must be receiued. Hence it is that Dauid sayth,Psal 119.105. that the word was a lanterne vnto his feet, and a light vnto his paths we are to marke, that he sayth not, it was a light vn∣to him to enlighten him, but to his feet and path, giuing vs to vnderstand that he did not rest in his illumination by the word, and in his apprehension of the truth but hee further applied it, to the guiding of his particular steps in the wayes of the Lord,  to the particular actions of his life;Else shall sin insinuate it selfe and get within our best actions. & indeed there is great reason, why we should not content our selues with the knowledge of the truth of the word, no nor yet with a temporary good liking of it, without appli∣cation of it, as particular occasion is euery day offered vn¦to vs, if we doe; we shall finde, that we shall not onely faint vnder many afflictions, but we shall faile in our best acti∣ons, sinne will insinuate it selfe, and get within them: hy∣pocrisie will get into our prayers, hearing of the word, re∣ceiuing the Sacraments and almes-giuing; yea wee shall fall into many knowen sinnes. Consider the example of Dauid, he doubtlesse knew the nature and quality of adul∣tery, and the iudgements of God attending on it. Yet be∣cause hee made not speciall vse and application of his knowledge he fell into that sinne.Ʋse and Appication. Apply wee therefore our knowledge diligently, to the particular actions of our liues. We see then the neces∣sity of this duty: let vs now suffer our selues in a word or two, to be stirred vp to the practise of it, and to this end know, that if we conceiue what is the will of the Lord in our best actions, in our hearing of the word, prayer, recei∣uing of the Sacraments, if we vnderstand that we are to
performe them by faith, repentance feare, loue, reuerence, zeale, obedience and humility: and doe not apply this our knowledge, to the forming of them in this manner, they become sinne vnto vs, and abhominable in the sight of God,Isay. 66.3. euen like the sacrifices of the Iewes, yea I dare be bold to say, that the knowledge of the death and passion of Christ, as it is a singular knowledge, so without appli∣cation it brings a singular iudgement, if it be not applyed both for the remission of our sinnes and our sanctification, it shall be a great encrease of our condemnation: if then we would not haue our best actions turned to sinne, yea, our knowledge of Christ a seale of condemnation: let vs not content our selues with the knowledge of the truth of the word of God, but learne to apply it to particulars as occasion shall be offered. VER. 10. That ye might walke worthy of the Lord, and please him in all things, being fruitfull in all good works, and encreasing in the knowledge of God. The Apostle sets downe in this verse the end of his prayer for the Colossians: to what end he praied for them, namely,Generall re∣solution of the tenth verse. that they might walke worthy of the Lod. Now because they might doubt how farre that extends, to walke worthy of the Lord, in the next words he explaines it, euen to the pleasing of him in all things, yea but might some say, how shall we walke so worthy of the Lord, as that we may please him in all things. The Apostle in the words following doth tell vs, by being fruitfull in all good works which is amplified in the last words, by the effect of such fruitfulnesse, namely, a further measure of illumination and knowledge of God, encreasing in the knowledge of God. These are the generall parts of this verse, come we to the words as they are layd downe by the Apostle.Particular in∣terpretations. The word (walke) is well knowen to them that haue any little
reading in the Scriptures, (who read with obseruation of the phrase) to be borrowed from trauellers signifying to liue, or to hold on a course of life, either generally in the duty of Christianity or in some particular place and cal∣ling, to walke worthy of the Lord is not as the popish sorte expound it, to liue so as that by Christian good life, we an∣swere the iustice of God, according to the rigor and exact rule of iustice, propounded in the morall Law, but that wee walke in vprightnesse, and sincerity of heart, as it is,Gen, 17, 1. walke before mee, and be then vpright, and so as it becommeth them who are called by the Gospell, to bee the sonnes and daughters of God, and to the hope of saluation: the Apo∣stle exhorteth to walke worthy our vocation,Ephes, 4, 1. Philip. 1, 27. and that our conuersation be as it becommeth the Gospell of Christ by which we are called to bee the sonnes of God, and to the hope of saluation, these two places serue to expound this, and shew that the words are thus to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had said that ye might liue both in respect of the duties of Christianity, (of your particular place and cal∣ling, vprightly as in the presence of the Lord, and as it be∣commeth them who are called by the Gospell to bee the children of God, and to the hope of Saluation. Doctrine. First, in that the Apostle prayed for the Co∣lossians,Our know∣ledge of Gods will ought to end in practise  that they might be fulfilled with the knowlege of Gods will, to this end that they might walke woorthy of the Lord, we are taught, that our knowledge of the will of God must end in practise. Looke what measure of know∣ledge we haue, wee must expresse it in the like measure of holinesse and obedience. For why? the will of the Lord reuealed, teacheth either things to be beleeued, and those are to be effectuall to stirre vs vp to holinesse, as the Apo∣stle saith, ye haue not so learned Christ, ye haue not so learned things to be beleeued concerning Christ, as that your learning and knowledge of him should leaue you in your corruption, to walke as other Gentiles doe, that be∣leeue not, or else the will of the Lord reuealed teacheth
things to be done which indeede are neuer truly knowne of vs, but in the practise of them, as wee know not in such sort as wee ought what any that is ouer vs, either Father or master or gouernour doth command to bee done, vn∣lesse we doe it, for that is the end of their command, which is not knowne but in the practise: againe knowledge in many places of the Scripture is compared to light, and wherefore is light giuen, but that wee should walke in it. Wherefore shines the sunne, but that a man should go out to his labour, so the light of knowledge is giuen that wee should walke in it.Ephes. 5.8. It is the argument of the Apostle: yee were once darknesse, but now are light in the Lord: walke as children of light, the night is past, and the day is at hand let vs therfore cast away the works of darknesse, and let vs put on the armour of light, so that we walke honestly as in the day, not in gluttony & drunkennes, neither in cham∣bering and wantonnes, nor in strife and enuying. For the vse of this point note wee this, there is neuer a one of vs liuing vnder the preaching of the Gospell,Look we that our life bee proportiona∣ble to our knowledge & profession. but we will seeme to haue gotten thus much knowledge, that we are to repent of our sinnes, and beleeue in Christ, that wee may bee iustified and saued, wee will thinke there is great disgrace and indignity offered the meanest of vs, if we be told we know not these things: though few indeed know them as they ought. Now then as we professe that we know in some measure the doctrine of faith and repen∣tance,Note. so let vs looke that our life be proportionable to our knowledge, that we walke in that light that is giuen vnto vs, take heede we be not found sleeping in the day light, and standing still and idle in the midst of our knowledge; and in this case beware of the subtilty and cunning of the Deuill, who so perswades with many that though they know Faith and repentance to be the way to life and salua∣tion, yet they need not so presently, and so soone as they know it, to walke in that way, but that it is enough for them to enter into that path at the hower of their death, &
suffici∣ent to expresse the knowledge of faith and repentance in death, and not in the course of their life, and to make his perswasion plausible and powerfull, he comes vpon them, as he came vpon our Sauiour Christ himselfe with scriptum est, it is written, and he telleth them they may finde it in the booke of God; and that the theefe on the crosse re∣pented at his last houre, and was receiued to mercy, and by this he doth so bewitch many, that they mocke at the doctrine of timely repentance, and sooth vp themselues in their prophanesse, and say (tush) if wee may haue but time to call for mercy at our death, it is enough, it is no matter for walking in the way of repentance, what should a man trouble himselfe that way, till he grow olde, or bee sicke and lye vpon his death bedde, repentance shall saue a man at any time, and we hope to dye repentant, and the seruants of God. Thus doth the Diuell delude and de∣ceiue many a poore soule, wee must take heed of this sub∣tilty and strong delusion of Satan, and that we may be ar∣med and strengthened against it, consider. First, that though true repentance bee neuer too late, yet late repen∣tance is seldome or neuer found, a man that hath liued a leud and a vitious life, and is now at the point to yeeld vp the ghost, sorrowing and greeuing, may iustly doubt of his sorrow, whether it be true godly sorrow or no, though it be about his sin, because he cannot wel perceiue whether it proceed from a loathing of his sinne, or from a feare of death, and whether he bee humbled before the mercy of the Lord, or in respect of his punishing hand; we haue one example indeed in the Scripture, the thiefe on the crosse that repened truely at his last hower, but we haue a thou∣sand to the contrary. Now what a madnesse is it for a man to cast himselfe on such a dangerous point, to enter into such a way wherein onely one hath escaped, and thou∣sands haue perished. Againe, though God haue promised forgiuenesse to true repentant sinners, yet hath hee not promised repentance to euery sinner, that euery sinner shal
repent when he lust, wee finde not that in all the booke of God: this wee find, that hee threatneth such as know his will touching repentance, and walke not accordingly, but sleepe securely in their sinnes, that he will come vpon them suddenly, yea, so as he wil be sure to find them sleeping, the Lord threatened the Church of Sardi,Reu. 3.3. that he would come vpon her as a theef, who watcheth his time, and commeth when men are a sleepe, yea more then that, for the theefe by making a noyse happily awaketh those that are lodged in the house that he breakes into; but the Lord saith fur∣ther to that Church, thou shalt bee still asleepe, and shalt not know what howre I will come vpon thee. This we see verified vpon many, who either are cut off by sudden death in the very act of sinne, or if they haue time giuen, yet the Lord either takes away vnderstanding from them, or sends vpon them such an horror and fearefull expectation of his wrath that they cannot repent, if then wee would not haue our sorrow doubtfull, euen such as we ourselues may iustly suspect not to be godly sorrow, but rather ari∣sing from the weakenes of the flesh, or bitternesse of paine, if we would not haue the Lords wrath to surprise vs, & to take vs sleeping in sinne, and cut vs off suddenly in our sin, let vs learne to expresse the doctrine of repentance, not o¦ly in death, but in our liues, and to walke according to the measure of our knowledge of faith and repentance. In the next place in that the Apostle saith that the end of our knowledge of the will of God must be a walking woorthy of the Lorde, that is as becommeth such as are called by the Gospell to be his children, we are taught that we must frame and portion out our liues according to the mea∣sure  of Gods mercy towards vs, we hauing receiued mer∣cy from the Lord,Our life must be proportio∣ned to the measure of Gods good∣nes towards vs. wee must walke according to the mea∣sure of mercy: if we perswade our selues wee haue so great mercy vouchsafed vs, as to bee the sonnes and daughters of God, we must lead our liues in a proportionable mea∣sure of holinesse and obedience, and walke as becommeth
sonnes, as the Apostle exhorteth:Eph, 5.2 3. Walke in loue euen as Christ hath loued vs, and hath giuen himselfe for vs, to bee an offering and sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauor to God. But fornication and all vncleannesse, or couetousnesse, let it not be once named among you, as it becommeth Saints, there is the ground of his exhortation, that hauing recei∣ued so great mercy and grace to be Saints, we are to walke as is fitting the Saints of God, and there is great reason why wee should so walke, because as the earth rendreth to the husbandman the fruit of his paines bestowed vpon it, so we should render to the Lord the fruit of his mercy be∣stowed vpon vs, and that is repentance,Roman, 4, 2. a renouncing of all vngodlinesse, and a liuing soberly and righteously, and godly in this present world.Tit. 2.12. And this is a duety of great  good vse and consequence, if it were thought on and re∣membred,It will seeme to be a soue∣raign restraint from sinning against God. it would hould vs backe from many notorious sinnes, would men be so prophane? would they break out into such blasphemous oathes, such cursed speaking, such drunkennesse, such filthinesse as many doe, if they did keepe in their mind a register, and remembrance of Gods mercies and fauours towards them in their bodies and soules, in their friends, in their countrey, in their magi∣strates, in their ministers or any other way; no doubtlesse, if such persons as are carried with violence against their neighbours to smite them with the venom of their railing and slanderous tongues, would but call to minde when they are in their heate; and their raging and madde mood the Lords mercy towards themselues, how the Lord hath dealt with them in great mercy, both in their creation and preseruation, and many other innumerable blessings, and (as they perswade themselues) in the greatest mercy of all, the forgiuenesse of their sinnes, and that they are to walke accordingly. Would they then goe on in their fury? no without question, then as Nehemiah said cap. 6.11. should such a man as I flee, so they would say, should such a man or such a woman as I that haue receiued so great mercy
from the Lord, should I so farre forget the Lords mercy, as to rage, raue, and some out mine owne shame against my brethren; no, no, I will rather suffer any iniury then I will doe such wickednesse and sinne against my gratious and mercifull God, this no doubt would be the fruit of the remembrance of this duety, let vs then bee carefull to re∣member and thinke vpon it, that we are to walke in a mea∣sure of holinesse answerable to Gods mercy towards vs, and know that if wee doe not so walke, wee turne Gods grace into wantonnesse, and then certainely the Lord wil turne his mercy into iudgement. Now to the words fol∣lowing (and please him in all things) heere the Apostle makes knowne how farre walking woorthy of the Lorde doth extend, namely to the pleasing of him in all things, the originall words signifie onely thus much,Interpreta∣tion. to all plea∣sing, but hauing reference and respect to that which (goes before the walking worthy of the Lord,) they may well be thus rendred, to his liking in all things, to the pleasing of him in all things. Now to please the Lord is (in a word) to obey the will of the Lord, according to that compara∣tiue speech,1. Sam, 15, 22. where we see, that to please the Lord, is to o∣bey the will of the Lord (in all things) that is in thought, word, and deede. Ob.We cannot please the Lord in all things, for who is it that sinnes not? It is true, we are not to looke what we can doe, but what we ought to doe, and what is our duty, we are to endeauor and to breath after that, euen to please the Lord in all things, yea to desire and seeke after it, as much as our ap∣pointed food,Math. 5.6. to hunger and thirst after it, for vpon that, our Sauiour pronounceth a blessing, wee are to labour in truth and sincerity to obey the will of God in all things, and if we faile in any things, (as we cannot chuse but faile in many things) yet we so endeauouring the Lord accepts our imperfect obedience in Christ, in and by whom the weake obedience of true beleeuers is accepted as the Apo∣stle
saith, thus then are these words to be conceiued,1. Pet. 2.5. as if the Apostle had sayd, euen to the hearty and sincere throgh imperfect obedience of the will of God, in thoght word and deed, which is pleasing vnto him by the mitiga∣tion and moderation of the Gospell, whereby the Lord doth moderate the rigour of the Law, and accept of your imperfect obedience as pleasing vnto him in Christ. In that the Apostle doth deliuer the sincere obedience  of true beleeuers vnder the title and terme,Our most sin∣cere obedi∣ence to Gods will cannot stand without reproofe in the sight of God. not of satisfy∣ing but of pleasing the Lord, and that onely in Christ: we are taught, that though we walk as becōmeth the children of God, yet we doe not thereby satisfie the iustice of God; our true and most sincere obedience to the will of God, is not able to stand without reproofe in the sight of God, the greatest and highest degree of excellency it can reach vnto, is in Christ to please the Lord. Wee shall finde that the Apostle doth often inculcate and beat vpon this point that our walking as becommeth vs, doth please the Lord,1. Thess. 4.1. Heb 13.16. but neuer that it doth satisfie his iustice. The cauill of the Papists on that place is not woorth the answering; they make (promeretur) to haue a passiue signification, and so no latine word, but a barbarous tearme. The point deli∣uered may further bee confirmed by this reason: there is no good thing done by any beleeuer and regenerate person, but it is stained by his intermedling corruption. Euen our righteousnesse is as a menstruous clout, and therefore not our best and most sincere obedience can sa∣tisfie the iustice of God, and stand in his sight without re∣proofe. Against this reason the Papists take exception,Exception. and say is the best obedience of true beleeuers stained with sinne, then it cannot please God, for say they, shall we say, that a sinnefull worke is a pleasing sacrifice to God, that is bla∣sphemy, the Lord hates sinne and all sinnefull workes, so that either you must make the obedience of true beleeuers not sinfull, or if sinnefull, then not pleasing to God.
Wee answer againe, that the obedience of true belee∣uers is not absolutely sinnefull, for then it could neuer bee pleasing to God; it is holy and good, for the kind, as it is enioyned by God, and as comming from the Spirit of God, but in the maner of doing it faileth and comes short of that perfection Gods iustice requires. Againe, the Lord doth pardon the sinnefulnesse of the obedience of true be∣leeuers & so accept of it in Christ, & in him, not in it selfe, is it pleasing to God; and it still remaines a truth, that the most our best obedience can be aduanced vnto, is to bee pleasing to God, this must serue to enforme our iudge∣ments, and to strengthen vs against the contrary opinion of the Papists,  who hold and teach, that the obedience of beleeuers doth answer the iustice of God,Consutation of the Papists. and make them more iust in the sight of God. We must hold it for a truth, that our best obedience is so farre from satisfying the iu∣stice of God, as that it pleaseth not God vnlesse he behold it in mercy, and in the face of Iesus Christ. Marke we fur∣ther what the Apostle adioynes to the pleasing of the Lord, that it must be in all things: our instruction thence is this, that true and sincere obedience of the will of God must bee entire, such as will approoue themselues to the Lord, and please him, must sincerely without doubling  obey his will in euery thing; howsoeuer we cannot reach to that perfection to please God in al things,True obedi∣ence to the will of God must be entire yet it must be the purpose of our hearts, we must purpose to please him in all things, and not to offend him in any thing, if we doe, it must be against our purpose. It is said of Iosias that he tur∣ned to God according to the whole Law, and of Zachary and Elizabeth,Luke 1. that they walked in all the commaunde∣ments of God: which is not to be vnderstood as that they kept the law in perfection, but in the purpose of their hart, they did not wittingly breake the commandements of God, & the reasons why we are thus to please God in our purpose and endeauour are these. First because the com∣mandements of God are so conioyned and linked toge∣ther,
as the transgression of one is the breaking of all,Iam. 2.10. for he that breakes one is guilty of all. Againe he that liues in the manifest breach of any one commaundement of God, if occasion be offered, he will break all, he being not regenerate, as hee doth plainely shew by his sinne, if it bee for his profit or pleasure, he will breake all the comman∣dements of God. Hence it followes necessarily, that sin∣cere obedience to the will of God must be entire. Let no man therefore perswade himselfe,  that he is one pleasing to God,He that liues in any one knowen sinne cannot per∣swade him∣selfe that he is pleasing to God. because the world which sees but the out∣side cannot conuince him of sinne, when his owne consci∣ence telles him, hee liues in the manifest breach of some commandement of God. Neither let any one flatter him∣selfe that his wayes please God, because he doth prosper in outward things, as many thinke they are highly in Gods fauour because they haue prosperity: that is a leaden rule, onely then wee please the Lord, when our obedience to his will is entire, when we purpose and endeauour to ap∣proue our hearts and liues vnto him in all things; and to helpe vs forward in this, know,Note. that we can neuer haue as∣surance of our owne saluation, till wee haue this holy pur∣pose and godly endeauour, so long as we liue in the mani∣fest breach of any commandement of God, though it bee only known to our selues, our consciences will not be set∣led, it will at one time or other rise vp & condemn vs, & if our conscience condemne vs, God is greater and knoweth all things,1 Ioh. 3.20. if then we would not be in continuall doubt of our owne saluation, which is a fearefull step to desparati∣on, let vs put on a goodly purpose of hart to please God in all things, both in thought, word and deed. The wordes following are an answer to a doubt that might arise from the former part of this verse, for some might say, how shall we walke worthy of the Lord:Interpre∣tation. the answer is by being fruit∣full in all good workes, that word (fruitfull) is metaphori∣call, and borrowed from trees that beare fruit, that as fruit∣bearing trees bring forth fruit according to their kind, so
we are to bring forth good workes, and to be fruitfull, is to bring forth good works, that is to say, holy and good a∣ctions,1. Iohn 3. for good workes are opposed to actuall sinne, wee finde them proposed vnder the name of actuall righteous∣nesse, and set against actuall sinne, where Saint Iohn makes opposition betweene doing righteousnesse and commit∣ting sinne, and to do righteousnesse is to performe a good worke, therefore, by good workes wee are to vnderstand holy and good actions: whereas the Apostle saith further (in all) his meaning is in all sorts of good works, inward & outward in body and minde, to insist in the Apostles own similitude, as fruitfull trees bring not forth fruit onely, on one bough or branch, but on euery branch plenty of fruit, so good workes the fruits of beleeuing Christians must be brought forth not only by the hand, the foot, the tongue and other members, but in all the powers of the soule, and in all and euery member of the body. Now to the doctrine: first, we are to marke that the A∣postle hauing testified the faith of the Colossians,Good works are fruits of faith. heere he faith, that he prayed further for them, that they might be fruitfull in all good workes, whence wee may conclude, that good workes follow faith, and are fruits of faith, wee shall finde this point if we obserue it constantly, taught by the Apostle. For first, he teacheth that we are iustified by faith in Christ, and then sanctified, and that our sanctifi∣cation is a fruit of our iustification, and therefore, good workes which are part of sanctification, they follow faith, and are fruits of faith in them that are iustified. Hence it is that hee saith,1. Tim. 1.5. that loue and so the duties of loue, good workes, come out of a pure heart, good conscience and faith vnfained,  and that text cleerely prooues this truth, it needs no further light for manifestation of it. The vse of this point may be this, are good works fruits of faith, then it is erroneous,It is errone∣ous to say, that workes are the forme and life of faith. nay, very absurd, to say as the Papists doe, that they are the forme and life of faith, not to make faith to be faith, but to make it good, liuely and
auailable to iustification, for so they teach. Now this is very grosse, who knowes not that it is contrary to all rea∣son, being contrary to the course of nature, to say, that the fruit giues life to the tree, euery man that knowes anie thing can say to the contrary, that the tree giues life to the fruit, so saith giues life to good workes, not good workes to faith, to make it auaileable to iustification, the life and forme of faith, by which it is effectuall to iustifie, is speciall affiance and trust on Gods mercy in Christ, and though such faith cannot be without works after it haue iustified, they follow vpon it as fruits, yet doe they not concurre with faith to the forming of it in the act of iustification, they hauing relation to faith as fruits, they onely as fruits declare it to be effectuall in it selfe, they giue not life vnto it. In the next place in that the Apostle is not content to say, (that ye might walke worthy of the Lord) but hee addes  bringing forth as being fruitfull,Our obedi∣ence to Gods will must not be onely in∣ward and ha∣bituall. we are taught that our o∣bedience must not be only inward and habituall, we must not content our selues with the hauing of any grace, be it neuer so excellent, be it faith or the feare of God, but we are to shew it and let it appeare in the actions of faith and of the feare of God, as fruitfull trees in their season doe bud and blossome and their fruits grow to ripenesse, and yeeld comfort to the owners, so our obedience and subiection to Gods will and grace wrought in vs, must shew it selfe in the fruits of it, to the glory of God, and the good of our brethren, and hence it is, that the Godly are called trees planted by the water side which bring foorth fruit in due season, yea, so planted,Psal. 1.3. as that in respect of their rooting they feel not when the heat commeth,Ierem. 17.1. & the yeere of drought cannot make them cease yeelding fruit. Thus it is with all Gods children,  & thus it ought to bee with all of vs, that haue anie grace wrought in vs,So it ought to be with all that haue any grace wroght in them. we are to manifest in the fruits of grace, & there is great reason for this, for why? the Lord will haue his grace that is in vs, known both to our selues & others, that is the end of al the
Lords dealing with vs, either by prosperity or aduersity, to discouer what is within vs, what grace there is in our hearts; we our selues cannot know whether we haue any grace in vs or no, but by the fruits of it, for example, the sappe of a tree beeing good, the tree is good, yet it is not knowen to be good by the sappe, but by the fruits of it, so we are not knowen to be good and to haue grace in vs, but by the fruits of grace, and therefore the grace that is wrought in vs, must appeare in the fruits of it, the feare of God must shew it selfe in the fruits of it, yea, in the proper fruits, such as properly issue and come from the grace of Gods feare, wrought in the hearts of Gods Children, and those are specially these, euen a trembling and a reuerent awe of God in prosperity, and a willing and ioyfull subie∣ction to his will in aduersity, not to bee lift vp in pride, or to lie securely in sinne in prosperitie, or to be vtterly deie∣cted in time of aduersity, but to tremble before the Lord in prosperity, when the hearts of the wicked are most lift vp, and to be inwardly comforted in the Lord in time of aduersity, these be the fruits that must be sent forth from the inward root the true feare of God, and thus the grace of God, that is in vs whatsoeuer it bee, must appeare in the fruits of it. And that wee may bee stirred vp to this duty, consider wee that the Lord will not, acknowledge any grace in vs, vnlesse it appeare in the fruits, the Lord sayth to Abraham, when he saw his willingnesse to offer his son in sacrifice, now I know that thou fearest me, seeing for my sake thou hast not spared thine onely sonne:Gen. 22.12. The Lord knew what heart was in Abraham before, he knowes the hearts of all his, but then by that fruit hee did acknowledge his true feare to be in him: so doth the Lord, then acknowledge a∣ny grace in vs, when it appeares in the fruits of it; againe, we must know if we content our selues with the habite of righteousnesse in the hauing of any grace in our hearts, the Papists shall rise vp in iudgement against vs, and condemn vs, for they bring foorth the fruits of their false religion,
and blinde deuotion, yea the very Athiests and vilest Mi∣screants of the world, shall stand vp in iudgement against vs, for they walke after their lusts, they shew the corrupti∣on of their hearts in all cursed fruits of impiety and sinne, let it then be a shame for vs to be behind them; let as many of vs as perswade our selues wee are religious and fearing God, be stirred vp to expresse the power and fruit of our religion and feare, that so the Lord may acknowledge his owne grace in vs, wrought by his owne good Spirit, and that neither Papists nor Atheists may euer by the euidence of their vnsauory fruits, rise vp against vs in iudgement, and condemne vs. Note we further, the Apostle saith, fruitfull in all good  workes,We must ex∣presse grace receiued in all good fruits. whence we are taught that wee are to expresse the grace that is in vs by all good fruits, for as true regenerati¦on is vniuersall, a transformation of the whole man into the image of Christ, so it must appeare and shew it selfe in all the powers of the soule, and if we be able to doe much, we are not to content our selues with doing a little, as the Lord shall enable vs, we must be fruitful in all good works and this is indeed a sure testimony of the soundnesse of re∣ligion. Before wee leaue these words, a cauill of the Po∣pish sort occasioned from this, and the like places of Scrip∣ture, is to bee answered. Hence the Papists take occasion to wrangle and to reason against that truth taught by our Church, that the best workes of beleeuers are stained with sinne, after this manner (say they) we finde that the holy Ghost heere and in other places of Scripture calleth many workes of beleeuers, good workes, and wee must needes thinke the holy Ghost speaketh the truth: but if they were infected with sinne, they could not be truely called good, for it can be no good worke that faileth either in substance or in circumstance, or that hath anie one fault in it, bonum ex integra causa, malum ex quolibet defectu, that is truely good, that is euery way good, and that is bad that hath a∣ny defect, therefore you must either say, that the holy
Ghost cals euill good, and that is blasphemous, or else acknowledge many good workes free from sinne. To this we answer: first, they reason from an Epithite or title that the Scripture giues to workes considered in the abstract by themselues as they are commanded, or as we are moued to doe them, and so indeed they are ho∣ly and good, but that is no good argument nor proof, that good duties done by vs, admitte we be true beleeuers, are perfectly good as we do them, and that they are free from the staine of sinne as they come from vs. Replie.Againe, because they will say wee finde, workes called good in concreto, considered together with the doers, & as they are done by beleeuers.Matth, 3, 16. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good workes, & glorifie your father which is in heauen. The holy ghost calling works done by vs good it follows they are not infected with sin, for if they be infe∣cted (say they) then they cannot be truly called good. Wee answere againe that is not true they say; that if workes be infected with sinne, then they cannot be truely called good, for workes inioyned by God, are very good in their owne kinde, and good as they come from grace, and the root of Faith, & the infection they receiue by our corruption, intermedling in the doing of them doth not prooue that they are not truly good, but that they are not perfectly good, and it makes them come short in the mea∣sure of goodnesse and perfection, and so the workes of true beleeuers stained with sinne, may be, and are in the scrip∣tures called good, because they are truely, though not perfectly good, as one saith well, they are called good, not after perfect iustice, but as is agreeable to our human fra∣gility. The last words of this verse containe the effect of fruitfulnesse, in good workes, namely a further measure of illumination and knowledge of God,Interpre∣tation. we are to vnderstand knowledge of things to be beleeued concerning God, ei∣ther touching his Essence, attributes, or workes, but speci∣ally experimentall knowledge of his grace and mercy in
Christ vnto saluation, for these wordes haue reference to that in the 6. verse (truly knew the grace of God) the first thing weare to obserue from them, is from the dependance of them, with the words going before, in that the Apostle saith, being fruitful in al good works, & so increasing in the knowledge of God, we are taught that fruitfulnes in good works, it brings forth a further measure of diuine & sauing  knowledge, good life increaseth sauing knowledge of God,Fruitfulnesse in good works brings forth a further mea∣sure of sauing knowledge. he that is fruitfull in good works, he feedes vpon his owne works, & by the very iuice of such fruits; his knowledge of the grace of God is nourished and increased, indeed many wicked men, whose liues, abound with much impiety, and are ouerspread with cursed fruits of sinne, haue sometimes a great measure of diuine knowledge, and by study and paines, doe encrease it, but the point is this, that diuine and sauing knowledge is encreased by fruitfulnes in good workes, and this may further be confirmed by Scripture,Iohn 7.17. saith our Sauiour, if anie man doe the will of God, hee shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God; he there pro∣ceedes from dooing the will of God to the knowledge of his doctrine. What man is he that feareth the Lord?Psalm. 25.2. him will he teach the way that he shall chuse, and verse 14. the secret of the Lord is reuealed to them that feare him: and his couenant to giue them vnderstanding: which wordes must needs be vnderstood of encrease of knowledge, be∣cause no man feares the Lord with true filiall feare, but he hath some knowledge of his mercy; and this also may be further strengthened by reasons. First, the more we exer∣cise ourselues in the feare of the Lord, the more holy wee are, and the more holy, the better able are wee, to discerne holy things; as in manuary trades, the more a man of or∣dinary capacity doth exercise himselfe in his trade, the more cunning and skilfull he becomes: so the practise of holy duties, doth helpe and strengthen vnderstanding of holy precepts. Secondly, the more holie we are, the nee∣rer we come to the nature of God, and to the puritie of
his word, and so wee are better able to discerne things re∣uealed from God in his word. The vse  of the point is this, do good workes serue, not onely to the glory of God, and the good of men; but doe they rebound backe to our selues, euen to this vse also, to a further encrease of sauing knowledge,The right vse of encreasing in knowledge is to bee doers of the thing we doe know. learne the right method and order of proceeding. Dost thou desire to en∣crease and to grow in the knowledge of God; then bee a doer of that thou knowest already, and thou shalt be bles∣sed in thy deed as Iames speakes, cap. 1.24. thou shalt finde a blessing on thy good work, to bring forth a further mea∣sure of knowledge. Many say they desire the knowledge of God, and to be instructed in his waies, but in the meane while they will not forsake their owne euill waies, and so though they haue means of instruction, they faile of their purpose. Dost thou come to the hearing of the word and thinke to be further built vp in sauing knowledge, and yet art guilty to thy selfe, that thou art so farre from beeing fruitfull in good workes, as thou hast not reformed that sinne of thine, whereof thou hast often beene conuinced, be it pride, couetousnesse, &c. I dare be bold to tell thee it is not possible, thou shalt finde that the Lord will punish thy fruitlesse hearing, with dulnesse and hardnes of heart. A scorner seeketh wisedome and findeth it not,Prou. 14.6. or shee will not be found, for so much doth the holy ghost imply in that sentence, that the grace of Gods spirit estrangeth it selfe, not onely from such as scorne and deride religion, but from such as professe religion, and lie wickedly, from the proud and vngodly, and if God withhold or withdraw his grace, what can follow, but heauinesse of minde, hard∣nesse  of heart, and vntowardnes to euery good duty. The wordes themselues doe further offer vnto vs this poynt of instruction,We are to goe on from one measure of sa∣uing know∣ledge to ano∣ther. being the very matter and substance of them, that we are to goe on from one measure of sauing know∣ledge to another, we are to encrease in the knowledge of God. This truth appeares both in generall, that we are to
grow in grace, and in speciall,2. Pet. 3.18. that wee are to grow in the knowledge of God, in one and the same sentence, grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: the equity and reason of it is laid down, they that know most, know but in part.1. Cor 13.9. Therefore wee are to labour euery day for increase of holy knowledge, and to that purpose let vs consider, that if we haue the meanes of knowledge, and doe not increase in knowledge, it argues  that wee are soule-sicke,Motiue. and that there is some secret di∣stemperature in our soules, if a man eate and drinke, and finde not his body thereby nourished and strengthened, he must needs thinke all is not well within him; so if wee come to the feeding of our soules both by the worde and sacraments, and finde no encrease of grace and sauing knowledge, it is more then a presumption that our soules are distempered and much out of order. Againe if we con∣tent our selues in our weake and small measure of know∣ledge, we are in great danger to bee seduced, and drawen into any error, for certainely where we are weake (be it in vnderstanding, or be it in affection) there the temptation will come against vs, at one time or other. If then we would not make it more then probable, euen plaine to our selues, that we haue some festred sore, and some lurking disease in our hearts, if we would not be corrupted and misled by popish inchanters, and seducers, and perish together with them, let vs labour to encrease in knowledge, and holy vnderstanding, that we may find the truth, hold the truth, walke in the truth, and liue and die in the truth. VER. 11. Strengthened with all might through his glo∣rious power; vnto all patience, and long suffering with ioyfulnesse. This verse is a continuance of the Apostles answer to the doubt arising from the first words of the former verse, where the Apostle saith, he praied for the Colossians that
they might walke worthy of the Lord. Some might ther∣upon demand, how shall we walk worthy of the Lord, his answer was begunne in these wordes, beeing fruitfull in all good workes, and heere it is continued, that we walk wor∣thy of the Lord, note onely by beeing fruitfull in good workes, but also by beeing strengthened with all might. And withall the Apostle layes downe the efficient cause and beginning of that strength, namely the glorious pow∣er of God, together with the vse of it in two particulars, namely in patience and long suffering (vnto all patience and long suffering) and further makes knowen the quality and condition of these two things in the last word (ioyful∣nesse) these are the generall parts of this verse. Come wee to the words of it, and first of these wordes (strengthened with all might) through his glorious power, by might is meant inward ability of mind and will, because this might is to be vsed in patience and long suffering,Interpreta∣tion. which are in∣ward graces of the minde and will, and by all might, is meant all kind of inward strength, answerable to the qua∣lity or multiplicity of trials and affections (glorious pow∣er) by power wee are to vnderstand the actuall power of God,Psal 115.3. and that not generall, whereby he effecteth what he willeth. Our God is in Heauen, hee doth whatsoeuer hee will,Ephes. 1.19. but his more speciall power working grace in them that beleeue, and this is called his glorious power, by an excellency, that is his power, specially manifesting his glory, hence it is that wee find his glory and power pro∣miscually put one for another: as thus then these first words are to be conceiued,Rom. 6.4. Ephes. 3.16. strengthened with all kinde of inward ability of mind and will, through the actuall pow∣er of God, which worketh grace in them that beleeue, to the speciall manifestation of his glory. In the first place we are to marke the first word of this verse (strengthened) the Apostle saith not being strong in the time present, as before, (being fruitfull) and increasing, but in the time past (strengthened) whence we may gather this point of instru∣ction
that strength to beare affliction must not onely shew  it selfe in time of affliction,Strength to beare afflictiō must bee pro∣uided before afflictiō come but it must be prouided afore∣hand, wee must bee well appointed and furnished with strength against the time of trouble, which must shew it selfe in bearing of it with patience. The Apostles wordes are very direct and plaine, he saith wee must be strengthe∣ned vnto patience, and this is further cleered, where the Apostle verse 10. exhorteth to be strong in the Lord,Ephes. 6. and in the power of his might, and presently in the next word subioynes that wee must bee armed, and at all points pro∣uided, and put on the compleat armour of God, that wee may be able to stand against the assaults of the Diuell, and verse 13. For this cause (saith he) take vnto you the whole armour of God, that wee may bee able to resist in the euill day, that is either of temptation or affliction,Luke 21.19. it is worthy obseruation to this purpose, that our Sauiour saith, pos∣sesse your soules in patience, patience and strength to beare afflictions must bee ours, not by vsurpation nor yet by lawfull vse and occupation, as a thing borrowed for the present, but by iust title and possession, we must haue it of our owne, we must be prouided of it to vse when time shall serue, and the reason and ground of this is, because wee cannot haue it at any time when we please,  the very light of nature teacheth men to prouide things of speciall vse a forehand, which they cannot easily come by, when occa∣sion serues to vse them. Now because the word (prouide) is a word of implication, and implies the vse of meanes, for prouision is made by meanes, some may desire more spe∣ciall direction in this case, what meanes may bee vsed to furnish themselues with strength against the time of trou∣ble and affliction;Meanes to be vsed to furnish vs with strēgth against time of affliction for the satisfying of their desire let them know that the meanes are not onely generall, as the word, praier, &c seruing to worke and encrease anie grace in them; but there be two things that peculiarly serue as spe∣ciall meanes to this purpose, to furnish vs and giue vs pos∣session of strength against the time of trouble and afflicti∣on,
the first is a frequent and serious consideration of the manner of our tenure, in what sort we hold and enioy the good things of this life, health, wealth and such like, that it is conditional, that we hold them with condition of the crosse, with a limitation of Gods correction, wee must of∣ten thinke on it, that the promise made that such as feare the Lord shall eat the good things of the land, is with con∣dition of the Lords triall and correction that they shal eat them; vnlesse it please the Lord otherwise to try and cor∣rect them; again we are often to meditate on the immuta∣bility of Gods loue, that his loue neuer changeth, but hee is the same good God, when he afflicteth, as when he pros∣pereth any of his children, if we perswade our selues that we are within the compasse of his speciall loue, wee must often thinke vpon it, that his loue is without change, and that whom he loues once he loues for euer, he may change our estate as seemes good to him, from prosperity to ad∣uersity, but he is the same good God, no changeling, good before affliction, good in affliction, and euer good to his children, and if this bee thought vpon and setled, it will furnish our hearts with a notable measure of Christian courage and fortitude, we shall finde our selues enabled with Iobs strength, to beare the greatest affliction, these two things then must bee thought vpon and remembred,Iob 13.15. that our hold of the good things of this life is conditional; and that Gods loue is vnchangeable, and we shall then be prouided of strength against the time of triall and afflicti∣on;  and know withall that for want of this preparation, when affliction comes we shall either grow impatient and seek vnlawfull means,Strength to beare afflicti∣ons being not prouided a∣fore-hand makes men ei∣ther become impatient, or else to vse vn∣lawful means. or else haue (it may be) a boldnesse, but a desperate boldnesse, without all comfort, such as is commonly in cowards, who being put to an exigent, are sometimes rashly bold, and desperately hardy, but wee shall not bee able to bee bold with consideration as the preacher hath taught vs. In the day of wealth be of good comfort, and in the day of affliction consider, that is, con∣sider
the author and vse of thy affliction, let vs then often thinke vpon our hould of the goods of this life, and the immutability of Gods loue, that so we may be strengthe∣ned to beare with consideration the greatest affliction. It followeth (with all might) as the first word teacheth that strength must be prouided, so these wordes shew the mea∣sure of prouision, that wee must euery way bee furnished with strength to beare affliction, if there were onely one kind of calamity and affliction, then one sort of strength  might suffice, but seeing there are manifolde,We must eue∣ry way be fur¦nished with strength to bear afflictiō Psalm. 34.19. yea a thou∣sand fold, many and great troubles, our strength must be answerable I might heere runne into a large field & speak much of the afflictions of Gods children, and thereby proue that we ought euery way to be prouided of strength to beare them, but I choose rather to apply this. And for the vse know wee it is not sufficient for vs to bee prouided of strength in mind onely, but our hearts must also be fur∣nished with strength, as we vse to say, that a man that en∣dures any paine stoutly and vnappalled, hee is a man of a stout heart: so indeed it may truly be said, when any af∣fliction is borne with patience and comfort, that the heart is stablished with Christian courage, wee must not onely know that the good things of this life are held with a con∣dition of the crosse, and that Gods loue neuer changeth; but we must in preparation of heart be ready willingly to forgo these good things and be fully assured in our hearts of Gods loue towards vs, howsoeuer hee deale with vs though hee should kill vs as Iob speakes; that is the right way to be strengthened with all might to beare afflictions with patience, and to be at all points prouided against im∣patiency, for indeed it is the right way to be strengthened against any sinne, to haue the heart stablished with grace; as the way to keepe out couetousnesse, is not as the Po∣pish sort teach by wilfull casting away our goods, & vow∣ing voluntary pouerty, there may be great corruptions in the heart after such deuised meanes are vsed, because they
are not ordained of God they are not blessed, but by cast∣ing out of the heart distrust of Gods prouidence and too much loue of this world, that is the way to keepe out co∣uetousnesse, and so the way to bee strengthened vnto all patience, is to be ready in preparation of heart to forgo all the good things of this life, and to be fully assured of Gods vnchangeable loue towards vs, and to helpe vs forward in  this duty,We are to cō∣sider that affli∣ction will dis∣couer, what is in vs. consider wee, that when affliction comes it will trie our strength whether our strength bee onely in our heads or sunke downe and settled in our hearts or no, as one saith well, affliction is a very tell-tale, it will looke into euery corner of vs, and draw out from vs what is within, it will discouer and tell abroad to all that looke vppon vs what is in our hearts, whether weakenesse or strength, we know it made a difference betweene Iob and his wife in this kind though both of them were happily strong afore∣hand in their measure of vnderstanding touching the na∣ture, author, and quality of affliction, yet when affliction came it discouered in the one strength and in the other weakenesse of heart, so it will doe with vs, and therefore it behooueth vs to labour to bee strengthened with all might, that when triall of affliction comes, it may not shame vs, laying open our weaknesse to all the world, pray wee euer with Dauid that our hearts may bee sound, that we be not ashamed, sound without halting & dissembling, sound without distrust, the roote of grudging and com∣plaining, that so wee may bee sound and strong both in mind and heart, vnto all patience and comfort in the grea∣test triall and affliction. Come we to the efficient and be∣ginning of strength to beare all afflictions, namely the glorious power of God, that is his actuall power, whence first briefely obserue wee that the actuall power of God, doth not onely worke vppon the will of man by chan∣ging it in the first conuersion, which the Papists denie, who say it is in the power of mans will, either to receiue or refuse grace offered, cleane contrary to many places
of Scripture. I will not stand to reason that point with them. But hence it appeares that the power of God doth not  onely worke vppon the will in the first conuersion,The power of God not only workes on the will in the first conuersi∣on but ater∣ward also. Heb. 6.19. but doth likewise afterward worke strength in them that be∣leeue, and this is to bee obserued, to this purpose it tea∣cheth vs, whence it is that true iustifying faith faileth not; and that hope is said to bee an anchor sure and stedfast; this comes to passe, through the power of Christ; which in his members is a continued power, working strength and hability in them, and neuer wholly interrupted, it is not any vertue or excellency in faith it selfe, or in hope it selfe, that makes eyther of them, of neuer failing continuance, for both faith and hope are changeable in themselues, and nothing in it selfe vnchangeable but God, but the power of Christ it is euer working in some degree in his members that makes faith not to faile, and hope an anchor sure and stedfast. Hence it is that the Apostle saith,  wee are kept through faith vnto saluation, but how?Hence it is that faith ne∣uer faileth. 1. Pet. 1.5. not by any strength in faith it selfe, but by the power of God. The wordes are very pregnant for the proofe of this, and very emphaticall, we are kept, or as the originall word is, being military, wee are guarded as with a strong garrison by the power of God, by which our faith is fenced and fortified against all hostility, so as no enemy of our saluation can breake in vpon it, to ouercome it, we may be assured of it, as many as are be∣gotten to a liuely hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ, that our faith shall stand and neuer be quelled in the grea∣test  trials, it beeing supported,Our strength by which wee stand in affli∣ction, is no of our selues, but from the power of God. strengthened and guarded by the omnipotent actuall power of God; we are further to obserue that the power and strength by which we stand vpright in the time of trouble and beare with patience any affliction, is not of our selues, but from the power of the Lord, we are strengthened with all might vnto all patience through his glorious power, for why? it is the actuall pow∣er
of God, that doth but support and strengthen faith as we haue heard, and also doth worke in them that beleeue, a feeling consideration of Gods vnchangeable loue to∣wards them, and a preparation of heart, willingly to beare any trouble, euen they that beleeue haue not these things of themselues, but from the actuall power of God wor∣king in them. Hence it is that the Apostle saith of him∣selfe,Phil. 4.13. that he was enabled and prouided of strength, to en∣dure any condition of life, to bee full and to bee hungry, to abound and to haue want: not by any power of him∣selfe, but by the helpe of Christ, and againe wee shall find, that the dearest seruants of God, such as haue had great measure of strength to beare afflictions, if the Lord did but a little withdraw his hand from them, their weake∣nesse hath then appeared, wee see it in Iob who whilst hee had the power of God, to support and strengthen him, was able in his greatest extremity, when hee was touched not onely in goods, but also in his children, to blesse God, and with wise consideration of the hand that smote him; to re∣proue & sharply to check the folly of his wife. Yet we find that afterward, when the Lord did but a little withdraw his hand, to shew that Iob stood not by his owne strength, but by his power, then did Iobs corruption and weaknesse shew it selfe, and cause him to breake out into some vnbe∣seeming termes of impatiency; it is then most cleare, that strength by which wee stand in time of affliction is not of our selues, but from the power of the Lord. This serues to discouer vnto vs a notable vntruth, and errour of the Papists,Confutation of the papists. who teach that wee may in this life haue in vs such perfection of inherent righteousnesse, as is sufficient to defend vs from all formall transgression of Gods Law, and all deadly sinnes (as they call them); be∣sides the errour in the ground of this opinion, which is an imagined perfection of righteousnesse in this life, if it bee layd to the doctrine deliuered and prooued, we shall finde they cannot stand together, for I hope, they will not deny
impatiency to bee formall transgression of Gods Law, be∣ing a sinne against the first commandement of the first ta∣ble, and wee haue prooued it by warrant of the Apostle, and strength of reason, that the power by which wee stand in time of triall, and are kept from impatiency, is not in our selues, but onely from the actuall power of God, ther∣fore not any perfection in vs is sufficient to defend from formal transgressions of Gods law: and to say we haue such perfection of goodnes in vs, as is able to keep vs from such transgression, is to make our inherent righteousnes, stron∣ger then euer was in Adam, in the time of innocency, nay, it is to ascribe vnto vs that which is proper to God alone, for he onely cannot possibly sinne, by reason of absolute and infinite goodnes in himselfe, and it is not the strength either of Man or Angell, that keepes him from sinning, but the power of God, and the speciall grace of God vpholding him. Againe, is the strength by which wee stand in time of  triall, not of our owne but from the Lord,Let us in time of trouble, be strong in the Lord, euen in the power of his might. Ephes: 6:10. Heb. 11:34. then let euery one learne to follow the exhortation of the Apostle in time of triall and affliction, to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, some may say, how is that to be done? how shall I that am a weake creature, bee strong in the Lord? the holy Ghost hath taught thee, that by faith, of weake, thou maist be made strong, get thou hold of the glorious working power of God by faith, and thou shalt draw downe strength from him, to beare with comfort the greatest trouble. We read of Stephen,Acts 7.55. when his persecutors were raging mad against him, that in the midst of their vi∣olence, his eye was in Heauen, his faith pierced the clouds, and came to the presence of God, and drew downe from thence strength, and comfort vnto him in the heat of his persecution, when his affliction was at the highest & sorest vpon him, thus it will be with vs, if wee be able by our faith to breake through the cloud of our affliction, that in the sence of flesh and bloud seemes to separate betweene God
and vs,Motiues to perswade to the practise of the former vse. and to apprehend the glorious power of God: we shall then finde his actuall power, working strength in vs vnto all patience. Let vs therefore raise vp our hearts to an apprehensiō of the power of God to strengthen vs in time  of affliction, and consider we what comfort is to beleeuers in apprehending the power of God, what rest and peace there is, in relying vpon it, it is worthy obseruation, that wee find that the Lord sayth, when hee lets you goe, hee shall at once chase you hence,Exod. 11.1. the Lord was not onely a∣ble by his mighty power to giue his people passage out of Aegypt, but to make Pharaoh that was so loath to let them goe, as glad to rid them away, as euer before hee was desi∣rous to hold them, what assurance then may wee haue of such end, issue and strength, as hee in his wisedome shall know best for his children that by faith depend on him, seeing he is thus able. Againe, let vs raise vp our hearts to rest by faith on the power of the Lord, to giue strength in time of trouble, vpon our owne former experience of his power, no doubt there is neuer a one of vs, but either hath or might haue found that the Lord hath enabled vs in some of our trou∣bles with extraordinary and vnexpected strength, & that ought to assure vs of hi power to strengthen vs in time to come, it is the very end, why the Lord doth manifest his power in our weakenesse, beyond expectation, that wee might euer in assured trust depend vpon him, & be strong in the power of his might, this was Dauids argument of comfort, hee was discouraged and taken vp short by Saul, and told that he was a boy:1. Sam. 17. What saith Dauid, O King I haue found that God hath heeretofore giuen me strength aboue nature, when I was in danger to bee deuoured of a Lyon and of a Beare. Therefore I doubt not but hee will euen now also be to me, as he hath beene, thus ought wee to raise vp our selues vpon former experience of the Lords mighty power, that as he hath beene, so hee will he power∣full to strengthen vs, and so by faith to rest vpon him.
Ioine to this as a third motiue to stirre vs vp, thus to  rest by faith, on the power of God, and so to be strong in the Lord, that which we finde in this very text, that the a∣ctuall power of God working grace and strength, it serues much for the manifestation of the glory of God; the A∣postle saith, through his glorious power: therefore wee may be assured, if by faith we rest vpon the power of the Lord, that the Lord may aswell lose his power, or lose his glorie, which is a thing impossible, as we faile of strength from him in time of affliction. Let these things be thought on, that it is comfortable to rest vpon the all-sufficient power of God, that our former experience of his power ought to as∣sure vs of continuall supplie of strength, if by faith we still depend vpon him, and that his power working strength in them that beleeue, tendeth to speciall manifestation of his glory, which euer was, and euer shall be deare vnto him: and therefore if we depend vpon him by faith, wee cannot faile of strength in time of trouble and affliction. And let the consideration of these things stirre vs vp to lift vp our hearts to heauen, and by faith to lay hold of the actuall power of God, that so in our greatest affliction we may be strong in the Lord. Come we to the vse of strength heere praied for, in two things laid downe in the words follow∣ing (vnto all &c.) and the qualitie and condition of these two,Interpreta∣tion. (ioifulnesse) by patience we are to vnderstand a quiet subiection of our wils to the will and pleasure of God, in time of any pressure, crosse, or affliction, euen to the death, without either seeking vnlawful meanes to ease our selues, or breaking out into bitter termes; for that indeed is im∣patiencie, when a man is displeased for the worke of God vpon him, and for laying his hand on him, and afflicting him, and seekes others to ease himselfe by vnlawfull meanes, or doth foolishly charge God that he deales hard∣ly with him, murmuring and complaining against him, the Apostle addes (to all patience) his meaning is to a quiet subiection of our willes to the will of God in any, yea in
the greatest affliction (long suffering) patience and long suffering differ not in kinde, but in the time: long suffering is not, as some would haue it, a distinct species or kinde of subiection of the will to the will of God, in time of afflicti∣on, but a continuance of it, because oftentimes the same affliction continues long: the word therefore heere vsed is translated,Iam. 5.7. long patience (ioifulnesse) that is, with ioy and comfort of heart. We must heere call to minde that this verse is a part of the Apostles answer to a doubt arising from the first words of the former verse,Wee walke worthy of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, not only by do∣ing good, but also by bea∣ring euill pa∣tiently. as we heard before; whence we may conclude and gather, that wee walke worthy of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, not onely by being fruitfull in all good workes, and by doing good, but also by bearing euill with patience. And to prooue this a little further, know that the will of God reuealed in his word, especially in the word of the Gospell, teacheth not onely that good must bee done, but that euill likewise must bee suffered. It is the generall Aphorisme and sentence of the Gospell,Reuel. 3.10. that all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, must suffer their measure of affliction, and it teacheth also how euill must be suffered, namely, with patience: hence it is called the word of patience, teaching to suffer euill, and how to suffer it; vpon which ground it followeth, that then we walke worthy of the Lord, to the pleasing of him in all things, when we both doe good commanded, and suffer euill laid vpon vs, with patience, as we are taught by the Gospell; againe, we are to consider, that then wee walke worthy of the Lord, when according to the measure of grace giuen, our life is conformable to the life of Christ, and then onely is it so, when wee doe good commanded, and suffer euill laid vpon vs with patience; for his obedi∣ence was actiue and passiue, a fulfilling of the law in his life, and a suffering with patience the cursed death of the crosse: thus must our obedience be, we must not only doe good, but suffer euill with patience, that we may be con∣formable
to the death of Christ, as the Apostle speakes.Phil. 3.10. First, let this serue to beat downe the reasoning of cor∣rupt  flesh and bloud,Affliction is no good ar∣gument to proue that the Lord loues not his chil∣dren. and stop the slanderous mouthes of wicked Atheists, which commonly, vpon occasion of the affliction of the godly, are open to blaspheme God, and charge him with want of loue to his children, because hee doth afflict them: the doctrine deliuered makes it plaine, that affliction is no good argument to prooue that the Lord loues not his children, and the Atheist cannot there∣upon gather it, that the Lord doth not regard them: for why? patience is an excellent vertue, a speciall part of Christian obedience, whereof there were no vse, if they were not afflicted; and thereis no vse of temperance out of occasion and meanes of riot and excesse, so there is no vse of patience out of afflictions. And besides this vse of affliction, which is sufficient to silence backe-biting flesh, charging God with want of loue to his children, it serues further to many other good vses, as to tame vnbridled affections, to conforme faith by speciall experience of Gods mercie, to stirre vp obedience, yea, it is as great an argument as can be of Gods loue, and of eternall retribu∣tion. So the Apostle reasons, we are chastened, and why?1. Cor. 11.32. because we should not be condemned with the world: let vs not then giue place to the reasoning of flesh and bloud in this case. Againe, for the second vse, is it so that our walking  worthy of the Lord, standeth not onely in doing good,It is but one part of our dutie to be∣haue our selues well in time of pro∣speritie. but in suffering euill with patience? then let euery one learne, that it is but one halfe part of our dutie, to carry our selues well in time of prosperitie: be it that wee walke without publike offence, and happily doe much good, it is not enough, wee must also learne to obey the will of the Lord, in a patient and quiet subiection of our wils to his will in time of aduersitie, that is another principall part of our obedience: it is as well required of vs, that we suffer e∣uill with patience, as that we doe good with cheerfulnesse
and because some, yea such as feare God, and haue a spe∣ciall measure of grace, and by grace are enabled to doe much good in time of prosperity, yet when affliction comes they find themselues defectiue in this part of obe∣dience, their corruption doth breake out and shew it selfe in some impatient worde or behauiour: let vs therefore thinke vpon this duety, and withall thinke vpon some thing that they may helpe and strengthen vs in the pra∣ctise of it. Note.And first to this purpose, consider we whence our affli∣ction comes, euen from the good pleasure and appoint∣ment of the Lord, all men for the most part will confesse the world to be gouerned by the Lord, but when it comes to their owne particular case in affliction, few do acknow∣ledge it, then some accuse the vncertainty of the things of this life, some ascribe their affliction to their owne rashnes and want of heede, others againe haue their eye set vpon the wickednesse of enemies that afflict them, accusing and condemning them, which is a fault besides impatiency, euen to confesse other mens sinnes, and not our owne, we must learne to looke higher, to see and behold Gods hand striking, and acknowledge his good prouidence in our af∣fliction, and that will make vs if any grace bee in vs in pati∣ence and silence to submit our selues to the will of the Lord, for why? hee is iust in afflicting vs, and wise, impo∣sing affliction vpon vs, for many good ends, and mercifull, he might iustly destroy vs. Note.Secondly consider that by impatiency we are cruell to our selues, we weaken our selues and make that stronger a∣gainst vs, which doth already torment vs, we adde afflicti∣on to our selues, in other things wee commonly loue our selues too much but in this we are cruel to our owne bow∣ells, and become instruments of further torment to our selues, and that cruelty is most barbarous, and the grea∣test cruelty, for any crime a man commits against him∣selfe is greater then it can be against another, as for a man
to murther himselfe, is a more fearefull degree of murther then to murther an other, and so if a man be cruel to him∣selfe, it is most sauage cruelty. Let vs then thinke vpon it that our affliction comes from the hand of God, who is most iust wise & mercifull in afflicting of vs, and that if we suffer our selues to be impatient, we are cruell to our owne bowells which is the greatest and most sauage cruelty. Let the consideration of these things stirre vs vp to a patient and quiet subiection of our wills to the will and pleasure of the Lord, that so wee may walke worthy of the Lord, both in prosperity and aduersity. It is further to bee mar∣ked, that the Apostle saith (vnto all patience and long suf∣fering.) Whence we are taught to be constant in patience,  and to beare with patience great and long continued af∣fliction. Wee must not beare Christ his yoke for a brunt,Wee are to beare with patience great and long con∣tinued affli∣ction. Luk. 9.23. Iames 1.14. but as himselfe hath taught vs, take vp his crosse daily, and follow him. Constancie is the complement and perfect worke of patience: this point needs no long proofe, it stands vpon the same ground with the former; it is easily prooued, but not so soone learned: for happily a man may in silence submit his will to the good will of God, in some one affliction; but when either another is added, or that increased and continued, then it is hard to continue patient, for then, besides the rising vp and rebelling of his owne flesh, the deuill will be ready to suggest, that none whom God loues was euer so dealt withall; and if we op∣pose to this suggestion the example of any childe of God, then he will shift his foot, and say, but neuer was any childe of God so greeuously afflicted as thou art. That wee may therefore be strengthned against this subtiltie of Satan,  and inabled with patience to beare great and long continued affliction,We are to la∣bour for strength a∣gainst Satans subtiltie in his persecutions. know that no such mea∣sure of affliction doth euer befall vs as hath beene laid on the Saints of God recorded in the Scripture, take one in stead of many, read and marke there affliction and an ex∣ceeding measure of it compassed round about,Note. his reines
cut, not spared, his gall powred vpon the ground, broken with one breaking vpon another, and runne vpon like a giant, can we say we haue such a measure of affliction? no surely, if wee speake the truth, we cannot: and I further prooue it:1. Cor. 10.13. The Apostle saith, the Lord will measure our af∣fliction according to the abilitie of his children. Now our strength when it is at the greatest, is farre inferiour to the strength of Iob, Dauid, or Abraham, and therefore we must needs confesse our trials and troubles are far inferiour and short of theirs. Let not then Satan euer preuaile with vs, to perswade vs, that neuer any whom God loued was af∣flicted as we are: let vs put backe his suggestion with this reason, and so learne to beare with constant patience the greatest measure, and the most long continued affliction, that the Lord shall lay vpon vs. Come we to the last word (ioifulnesse) this (as we said) is the qualitie and condition of patience and long suffering. Our instruction hence is  this; it is not enough to be patient and silent in great and long continued affliction,It is not e∣nough to be patient in great and long conti∣nued afflicti∣on, vnlesse it be with sweet contentment. Reasons of the doctrine. vnlesse it be with sweet content∣ment, ioy, and comfort: wee must not only be content to beare the miseries and afflictions of this life, so farre the Heathen could goe vpon consideration of fatall necessity, but we must goe a step further, euen to reioice in our affli∣ctions, yea as S. Iames saith, 1.2. count it exceeding ioy when ye fall into diuers tentations. Reasons of this are gi∣uen first by Peter, because wee are in affliction conforma∣ble to Christ, reioice (saith he) in as much as yeare parta∣kers of Christs sufferings. Secondly, by S. Paul, when we are weakest, we are indeed strongest, hauing then speciall fauour,2. Cor. 12.10. Vse. If patience be not with ioy, it is not plea∣sing to the Lord, nor a fruit of grace. protection, and strength from the Lord: therefore saith the Apostle, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproches in necessities, in persecution, in anguish for Christs sake, for when I am weake, then am I strong: let this be thought on, that patience must be wirh ioy and comfort; if that be away, it is not pleasing to the Lord: and againe know that patience with ioy and comfort is a true marke of
Gods childe, for affliction being sanctified, and sent as a testimonie of Gods loue towards his children,Heb. 12.7. if wee with patience and comfort endure it, God in it and by it doth offer himselfe vnto vs, as vnto children, affliction of it own nature doth presse downe the hart, hands and eies: if then faith, patience and comfort can keepe the heart, hands, and eies vpwards, it is a manifest argument that the spi∣rit of grace and strength doth rest vpon vs, making faith to triumph ouer the triall, and making vs conquerors, yea more than conquerors. Let this be considered,Rom. 8.32. and stirre vs vp to a cheerefull and comfortable bearing of any affli∣ction, though it be great, and long continued vpon vs. And so much of this verse. VER. 12. Giuing thankes vnto the Father which hath made vs meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light. The Apostle hauing finished the proeme and entrance of his Epistle, standing on a congratulation and compre∣cation from the third verse to this twelfth, now hee enters vpon a summarie declaration of the doctrine of saluation from this verse to the 23.A summarie declaration of the doctrine of saluation from this 12. vers. to the 23. The generall proposition. The parts of it. the generall proposition laid downe in these verses, is this, that saluation comes vnto vs from God the Father, by his Sonne Iesus Christ, true God and man, and the head of his Church, whose merit is suf∣ficient to all perfection of eternall life. The parts of this proposition are two: First, a declaration of the fountaine and first Author of saluation, namely God the Father, to∣gether with the effect wrought by him, in vers. 12.13. 2 Secondly, a manifestation of the worker of it, Iesus Christ, and the worke wrought by him, namely redempti∣on, vers 14. to which is sub-ioined in the verses following a confirmation and proofe of his sufficiencie to redeeme vs; and that is prooued both by the dignitie of his person
that he was true God, the image of the inuisible God, the first borne of euery creature, and by the eternall decree and good pleasure of his father, together with the applica∣tion both in generall, and in speciall to the Colossians. The words of the 12. and 13. verses, being the first part of the generall proposition, containe in them two things; first, the effect wrought by God the Father, verse 12. Secondly, the manner how it was wrought, verse 13. In the twelfth verse we finde more specially a thanksgiuing to God (gi∣uing thanke,) and the reason and ground of that in those words (which hath made, &c.) and the place of that inhe∣ritance in the last words (in light.) First, briefly examine we the words of the 12.Interpreta∣tion. verse, the word (Father) is heere to be taken personally, for the first person in the Trinitie, because one person is conferd with another, and it stan∣deth in relation to Christ (meet) that is, fit, sufficient, so the word is rendred, and it is so there translated by the Pa∣pists themselues, yet heere they translate it (worthie) la∣bouring thereby to vphold their opinion of inherent wor∣thinesse and condignitie deseruing saluation, which in∣deed cannot stand either with the proper signification of the word, or with the context, and with that in the verse following, where it is shewed how we are made fit, namely by effectuall vocation, iustification, and a measure of san∣ctification. (To be partakers) or to be a part (inheritance of the Saints) that is to say, life and glory, giuen as it were by lot (for the Apostle alludeth to the diuision of the land of Canaan) to them that are sanctified by faith (in light) that is to say, in the glorious kingdome of heauen, for so we finde the word (light) taken,Act 26.23. shew light or preach light, that is to say, life eternall. Now come we to such things as may be obserued from this verse. First, we are to marke that the Apostle entring on the doctrine of saluation, and the consideration of the grace of God in the worke of redemption, he begins with thankes∣giuing to God. Our lesson hence is this, when wee either
thinke or speake of the grace of God in the worke of our redemption, then our hearts must bee enlarged,When wee ei¦ther thinke or speake of Gods grace in the worke of our redempti∣on, wee are to magnifie the name of the Lord. 1 Peter 2.9. and our mouthes opened to magnifie the name of the Lord, for that is the end of all the mercies of God bestowed vpon vs. It is the end of all the actions of God tending to saluation: yea of the chiefest of them, our glorification in heauen. The point of thankesgiuing was handled before in the third verse; and therefore in a word know we, that as ma∣ny as haue any comfortable feeling of Gods grace in the worke of redemption,  are thus affected,Such as com∣fortably feele Gods grace in the worke of redemptiō are so affected they neuer thinke or speake of it but with thanksgiuing, and it is a sure note and marke that wee finde true comfort in the doctrine of grace, if when we thinke or speak of it, our hearts be filled with ioy, and our mouthes opened to praise the Lord; for this beeing an exercise of the blessed Angels and Saints of God in heauen, who do continually sing, thou art worthy to take the booke, and to open the seales thereof, because thou wast killed, and hast redeemed vs to God by thy bloud out of euery, &c.Reuel. 5.9. It cannot chuse but in some mea∣sure be begun in this life, and bee found in them who shall heereafter be glorified in heauen. I come to the matter of the Apostles thankesgiuing  (which hath made vs meete) comprehending vnder that generall (of making meet) as one speciall branch of it,God the fa∣ther doth tru∣ly and really impute the righteousnes of Christ to them whom he doth iusti∣fie by his grace in Christ. the iustification of a sinner, wee may conclude that whome it pleaseth the Father to iustifie by his grace in Christ, to him he doth truly and really impute the righteousnesse of Christ, and by his righteousnesse make him truely and re∣ally meet and fit to bee partaker of glory in heauen, it is not an imaginary or a supposed imputation of Christ his righteousnes, by which wee stand iust and righteous in the sight of God; the Papists doe scornfully terme it imputa∣tiue iustice and tell vs that we are to tremble at that which follows vpon it,  that as we haue no righteousnesse nor me∣rit of heauen but (as they call it) by a supposed imputati∣on,Confutation of the Papists. so must we look for no heauen, but by imputation, we
are from hence to take notice of it, that it is not (as they falsly cauill) a supposed, but a reall imputation of righte∣ousnesse, whereby we stand most in Gods sight, we are not in conceipt made meet for the kingdome of Heauen, but truly and really, and to this agreeth that of the Apostle, that we are made the righteousnesse of God in Christ,2. Cor. 5.21. that as our sinne was truely and really, not in conceipt; but in¦deed truly imputed vnto him, and hee made sinne for vs: so are we made the righteousnesse of God in him. It is but a fond cauil to shift off the plaine euidence of that place in that they say Christ was made sinne, that is to say a sacri∣fice for sinne, thereby thinking to elude the people of God and to perswade that we misconster the place, for wee con∣fesse it, that he was a sacrifice for sin, but he was therefore a sacrifice for sin, because our sin was imputed vnto him and punished in him, and therfore it is said that he was made a curse for vs,Gal, 3.13. because the curse wee had deserued was impu∣ted vnto him that the blessing of Abraham might come vpon vs, through Christ Iesus, that wee might receiue the promise of the spirit through faith. Let vs not then bee driuen from this truth, by any cauill or scorne of the Pa∣pists, but learne to hold it as a certaine trueth, that it is a true reall imputation of righteousnesse, by which we stand iust in Gods sight, and this is further cleare by our reall vnion with Christ by the bond of his spirit; for by the spi∣rit and faith wee are really members of Christ his misticall body and so his righteousnes and merits are truely and re∣ally communicated vnto vs, and we haue interest in them  as the members of his body. The second point that may be gathred for our instruction is this, that none euer come to be partakers of life and glory in heauen,Such as come to bee parta∣kers of Christs glory in Hea∣uen are made fit for it in this life. but such as are before made meet and fit for it, not onely by a reall impu∣tation of righteousnesse, but by a measure of inherent ho∣linesse and sanctification, and to proue this further, we are to know, that howsoeuer it bee true, that no goodnesse or holinesse in vs is proportionable in merit and desert to the
least degree of glory that shall be reuealed because our best holines is imperfect, and life & glory is not giuen for the worthines of it, yet this is as true againe, that life and glory shall be giuen in mercy according to the measure of holi∣nes, and where there is a greater measure of holines, there shall be a greater degree of glory, and consequently where there is no holinesse, no glory, nor the least degree of glo∣ry can be looked for;Rom. 2.6. The Apostle hauing deliuered it in the generall, that the Lord will reward euery man accor∣ding to his workes, he presently subioynes a particular ex∣plication that vnto all them that continue in well dooing, the Lord will giue glory, honour, and immortality, and e∣ternall life, but on the contrary, such as are contentious & disobey the truth, & obey vnrighteousnesse, they can look for no such reward from the Lord, vppon them shall bee indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, and vpon the soule of euery one that doth euill. Wee may obserue that though the kingdom of heauen be prepared for them that are blessed of God the Father, verse 34.Math. 25. yet they are not sent into the possession of it. By the sentence of our Sauior before he makes it known, both to themselues and to all the worlde that they are fitted for it in measure of sanctification, and that they testified the same by their workes of mercy towards his members, that they fed the hungry, cloathed the naked, visited the sicke, &c. whence it is most cleare, that none euer come to bee partakers of life and glory in heauen, but such as are before made fit for it by a measure of holinesse. By this doctrine you shut out infants dying in infancy from the participation of life and glory in heauen,  because they cannot be so fitted. The doctrine must not be extended to them,  but vnder∣stood of such as bee of discretion, for infants within the couenant, and in Gods euerlasting election, dying in their infancy are saued, nor by actuall faith, which they cannot haue, wanting actuall knowledge, but by some other spe∣ciall
worke of Gods spirit, not knowne to vs, and so not a∣ny actuall sanctification is required of them. Is it so that where no holinesse is, there can be no expe∣ctation of life and glory in heauen,Vngodly and prophane per∣sons in vaine look to come to heauen cō∣tinuing in their sinnes. Heb. 12.14. Isay. 3 9. no comfortable sight of God hoped for, then let no vngodly prophane man or woman, such as declare their sinnes as Sodom, sooth and flatter themselues, and thinke they shall get to heauen wel enough for all their abhominable silthinesse, (if they so thinke) they are much deceaued, and let them heare it from the mouth of the Lord as a terrible sentence to all vnrepentant sinners, that no vncleane thing, neither what∣soeuer worketh abhomination or lies, shall enter therein, but they which are written in the lambs booke of life. It is therefore the exhortation of the Apostle,Reu. 21.27. let no man de∣ceiue you with vaine words, and I may say, let no man de∣ceiue himselfe with such vaine words or perswasions: this ye know (saith the Apostle,Ephe. 5 6. vers. 5. that no whoremonger, neither vncleane person, nor couetous person, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ and of God, but because many please themselues in their filthinesse and sinnes, in hope heereafter to finde mercy, though they haue heard that late repentance is seldome true repentance, and they may happily feeke it and not find it. I would entreat him that wee may a little further reason together vpon the doctrine now deliuered, they haue heard it proued that none can come to bee partakers of life and glory in heauen; but such as are before made fit and meete for it, and can they thinke that they are fit for heauen who without remorse of conscience do again cru∣cifie Christ, and make his wounds to bleed a fresh; thus do all hard hearted and vnrepentant sinners by their sins, if therfore they rightly consider it they most of force con∣fesse, that they foolishly perswade themselues they shall get to heauen. Oh, but Gods mercy is great? it is true, hee is a God of infinite mercie, but yet a iust God, and it is strange that wicked prophane wretches shold dare to pre∣sume
of Gods mercie vnder many sinnes, and yet they may finde, that God hath shewed his iustice to the dearest of his children: to Moses, to Aaron, to Dauid, and others, for committing some one sinne; yea, which is more, Christ himselfe, the glory and image of his Father, could not e∣scape the bitter death of the crosse, because he became sin for vs. How then can bold and presumptuous sinners per∣swade themselues they shall escape the punishing hand of God, they adding sin to sin, and wallowing in their sinnes till death, without repentance? Let them duely consider this, and for conclusion of this point, let vs know, that there is no comfort to be had in our hearts, touching life and glory in the world to come, but onely by a true espiall of sanctification of life in our selues: and let it mooue vs to labour by all appointed good meanes to come to a mea∣sure of sanctification, that so we may glorifie our heauenly Father in this life, and may seale vp assurance of our happy estate in his glorious kingdome in heauen (to be partakers) or to a part. Hence a question is occasioned. Some may say,  shall we haue distinct parts of glory in heauen, because the Apostle saith, made meet to a part, it may seeme some shall haue one part of glory, and some another. No, the very word vsed by the Apostle is against it,  it being a word of the singular number, cannot imply multi∣plicitie of parts. But for ful answer, know that al the Saints shall haue the same happinesse and glory in substance, namely, perfect vnion and coniunction with God, and participation of all eternall good things from him; but all shall not haue the same degree of glory, but some greater, some lesse, answerable to the degrees of goodnes in them The Prophet doth inferre vpon the generall resurrecti∣on,Dan 12.3. that they that be wise, shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament, and they that turne many to righteous∣nesse, shall shine as the starres for euer and euer. And the Apostle plainely teacheth this point,1. Cor. 15.41. there is one glory of
the Sunne, and another glory of the Moone, and another glory of the Starres: for one Starre differeth from another Starre in glory. And howsoeuer that in the parable, that all the labourers in the vineyard receiued euery one a pe∣nie,Mat. 20.12. may seeme contrary to this; yet wee must vnderstand it, as lying vnder this distinction that in respect of essenti∣all glorie, all the elect shall haue the same; but in regard of accidentall glorie, and the degrees of glory, therein they shall not be equall.Vse of the an∣swr to the question. And let not this be a point of specula∣tion, onely seruing to make vs able to talke of it: if we rest in that, the very Deuill shall reape as much profit by it as we. But let vs labour to make it comfortable to our selues, let it be laid as a ground in our hearts of comfort, and of godly emulation, euen to make vs striue to excell one an∣other in holinesse, that so wee may finde strong consolati∣on and comfort of conscience in this life, and increase of our glory in the life to come (inheritance) in that the Apo∣stle cals life and glory in heauen, an inheritance, it is most  cleare to any that will rightly consider it, that it is giuen to Gods elect,Life and glo∣ry in heauen is giuen to Gods elect freely. whom it pleaseth the Father to make meer for it, not vpon any desert of theirs, but freely: for why? we know that an inheritance is giuen to the childe, of the meere loue of the father; it may bee, it was prouided for him before hee was borne, and before hee could doe any thing for the deseruing of it. And thus our Sauiour speakes of the heauenly inheritance,Mat. 25.34. Inherit you the Kingdome pre∣pared for you from the foundations of the world. It is a thing commonly knowen, that amongst men, an inheritance is not giuen to the seruant, who peraduenture hath done something either in the getting or keeping of it, but it is giuen to the childe, who happily is so farre from doing a∣ny thing, either to the getting or keeping of it, as yet hee lies crying in the cradle; so that by this word (inheritance) the Holy Ghost would haue vs to vnderstand, that life and glory in heauen is freely giuen, and not vpon desert. A∣gaine, if the word be taken in the other signification, it
doth demonstrate and prooue the same thing, that life and glory is freely giuen: for shall we say that a man doth pur∣chase by merit, that which comes vnto him by lot? That were not only to go against the common receiued opini∣on, that lot stands on meere chance, but to giue the lie to the plaine text, The lot is cast into the lap,Prou. 16.33. but the whole disposi∣tion thereof is of the Lord: so life and glory being called a lot, it doth plainly euince, that it is at the free disposition of the Lord, and giuen of his free grace. And the reason is giuen by the Apostle: by grace are we saued,Eph. 2.9. lest any man should boast himselfe, lest any should glory, that he brings any thing to the procurement of his owne saluation, there∣fore it is, that we obtaine life and saluation freely. And with this agrees that, where the Apostle hauing prooued that wee are iustified freely, hee saith,Rom. 3.27. where is then the reioi∣cing? First, this serues to confute and ouerthrow that opinion  of the Papists,Confutation of the Papists. who hold and teach that life eternall is gi∣uen to them that are first iustified by Christ, vpon their de∣sert for the merit of their owne good workes, and wages due to them by debt. Beside the errour of this opinion, supposing a twofold iustification in the sight of God, which can neuer be prooued by the word, it cannot stand with the truth now deliuered: for if eternall life bee freely giuen of grace, then not vpon desert for dignitie of good workes. Free gift and due debt cannot stand together. Oh but (say they) life eternall is called a reward: it is true,  but we must learne to distinguish with the Apostle,  reward or wages is twofold, of fauour, or debt:Rom. 4.4. Note. life eternal is a reward of fauor, not of debt: it is giuen of the meere grace of God, without any desert of ours. We are to obserue it, it is wor∣thy obseruation, that wheresoeuer in any place of Scrip∣ture mention is made of reward, wee shall finde that it is promised to the worker, and not to the worke it selfe, as shall reward thee openly,Mat. 6. whereby the holy Ghost would haue vs to vnderstand, that though reward be giuen in re∣spect
of the worke, yet it is not giuen for the worth and dignitie of it, but it is giuen for Gods gracious acceptance of the person, and consequently of his worke in Iesus Christ; its giuen of fauour, not of debt, as deserued by the good worke done by any beleeuer. But the Papists fur∣ther replie, that Christ hath merited, that the workes of his members should be meritorious of life euerlasting: a meere deuice of their owne. This proposition is no where to be found in the Scripture Wee finde in many places, that Christ died for our sinnes, but no where for our good workes, to make them able to merit, and to purchase fa∣uour at Gods hands; and indeed it is not possible that our best works being imperfect and stained with sinne, should haue the true and whole nature of merit. It is a manifest contradiction, that any worke should haue need of par∣don from God (as all ours haue) and yet fully satisfie the iustice of God, and deserue at his hands. Yea more than that, if Christ his obedience had beene imperfect, and any way defectiue, though he were God and man, yet it had not beene meritorious of life and saluation; for that were to make contradictories true together, which all Di∣uines, yea Schoole-diuines (from whom the Papists fetch the bodie of their diuinitie) hold impossible to God him∣selfe, because it is an argument of impotencie, not of power. Againe, for the second vse, is eternall life giuen as an in∣heritance freely?We are to ex∣presse our thankfulnesse to God for his free gift of life eternall. surely then, though wee cannot deserue the least degree of it, yet it is the pleasure of God our Fa∣ther, that wee should labour to expresse our thankfulnesse by all holy obedience vnto him; for it holds by proporti∣on, that if wee are to be thankfull to God for the bread we haue to put into our mouths, and for other temporall bles∣sings, as it is our dutie, because they are the free gifts of God, and the vse and comfort we finde by them, comes from the Lord, then much more are wee bound to bee thankfull vnto him, for making vs his owne children,
we that are not sonnes by nature, making vs his Children by adoption, yea, sonnes and heires, euen ioynt-heires with Christ his naturall Sonne, and by him, giuing vs suf∣ficient and certaine title, to an euelasting inheritance in his owne Kingdome. This is to bee thought on,Rom. 8.17. and be∣cause euery one will be ready to speake peace to his owne heart in this case, and perswade himselfe, that he is thank∣full to God for his grace and adoption, let vs learne to ex∣amine our selues whether we be so or no. How is that to be done?  (may some say) Euen by our thankefulnesse to God for his gifts of a lower nature, for things of lesse waight,  then is the King∣dome of Heauen, euen for the good things of this life, if we finde that we are truely thankefull for them, and mo∣ued by them to walke humbly before the Lord, and the more the Lord doth open his hand in blessing vs in these things, the more our hearts are enlarged in duety and thankefulnesse towards him, then we may conclude, that we in some measure are thankefull for the grace of adop∣tion heere, for the Spirit worketh in vs, as in Dauid,2. Sam. 7.18. vp∣on the consideration of Gods fauour in outward things, to say, who am I, O Lord God and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? and the same spirit will be powerfull in vs, vpon consideration of our title by grace, to the inheritance of the Saints in Heauen, to say, Lord who am I that thou shouldest thinke of me, chuse me, and make me thy childe and heire of Heauen, on the contrary, if we be not thankefull to God, for the good things of this life, but after the manner of the wicked, the more the Lord doth encrease and multiply his gifts, the more we encrease in pride and vanity, in scorne, contempt and disdaine of  others; let vs then say and pretend what we will,Such as looke for life and glory in Hea∣uen, must bee of the number of Saints. we shall neuer bee able to prooue it, and to make it good, to the comfort of our owne soules, that we are thankfull to God, for our title to his free gift of life and glory in Heauen. (Saints) This word pointeth out the same thing, that
was before deliuered, that such as looke to come to be par∣takers of life and glory in Heauen, must in some measure be sanctified, they must be of the number of Saints. For further vse  of it, let such persons, as do many times wilfully absent themselues, from the hearing of the word,Reproofe of those, who will fully neg∣lect the vse of the Word & Sacraments. and participation of the Sacraments at times appointed, thinke vpon this one poynt, shall none come to be parta∣kers of life and glory in heauen, who are not of the num∣ber of Saints. How then can they looke for it, who witting∣ly and wilfully breake off holy Communion and fellow∣ship with the Saints, and doe openly deuide and separate themselues, from the Society of them that shall bee glori∣fied in heauen? know it for truth, thou must either hold Communion with thy brethren in this life, in good things or else neuer looke to haue Communion with them, in the life to come. If thou doe excommunicate thy selfe (so I may iustly speake) and by a wicked and waiward separati∣on deuide thy selfe from the society of the Saints vpon earth, certainely without repentance, thou shalt for euer be excommunicate, and shut out of heauen. (In light) That is to say (as ye heard) in heauen, now heauen is set out vnder the name of light,Heauen is set out vnder the name of light to shadow out the com∣fort there to be found. to shadow out the excellent comfort that is there to bee found, for wee know how comfortable a thing light is. As hell is resem∣bled to vtter darkenesse, to teach vs the horrour of it; the vse of this, as of other resemblances, setting out the ioy, comfort and glory of heauen, is to worke in vs Saint Pauls affection,  and longing desire of heauen, and a labouring by all good meanes to attaine vnto it,We are ther∣fore to haue a longing desire of Heauen, & to vse all good meanes to at∣taine it. Psal. 4.6. and to this end, let vs a little meditate vpon this one similitude, as many as are the children of God, doe know, that there is no such com∣fort to be found in any thing vnder heauen, as in the light of the Lords countenance shining vpon them, Dauid pre∣ferred it before wheat and wine. Now in heauen, that light of the Lords countenance, shall be the light that shall shine vpon vs in full brightnesse,Reu. 21.23. the glory of God doth light
the heauenly Ierusalem, how then ought this to affect vs, and to stirre vs vp in a longing desire after it, euen earnest∣ly to striue to come to walke in that vnspeakable bright∣nesse of the glory of God, the glory and light of the lambe Iesus Christ a light that neuer shall be obscured with any darkenesse. VER. 13. Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darke∣nesse,  and hath translated vs vnto the Kingdom of his deare sonne. The Apostle shewes in this verse, how God makes his Elect meet to bee partakers of life and glory in heauen, namely, by deliuering them from the power of darknesse and translating them into the Kingdome of his deare Son, vnder which termes, of deliuering and of translating, are signified their effectuall vocation, iustification and sancti∣fication, through the effectuall working of his spirit, by the word of the Gospell, for these are the degrees of Gods loue manifested in time to his chosen, and in these very termes doth the holy Ghost, speake of the vocation of the Gentils where Saint Paul saith, hee was sent as an instrument,Rom. 8.30. Acts. 26.18. by the preaching of the Gospell to conuert and call the Gen∣tiles, and propounds the end of his sending in these very words (to open their eyes &c.Interpreta∣tion.) Come we to speake of the first of these (who hath deliuered vs from the power of darknesse) the word translated (deliuered) doth signifie such a deliue∣rance, as in respect of them that are deliuered, is neither deserued by them, nor desired of them, but is, as it were, a drawing and an haling, as is the pulling of a beast, or ra∣ther a dead waight out of a pit, and in respect of the deli∣uerer, it signifieth such a deliuerance, as is wrought by his almighty power, by the power of his spirit. And by the power of darknesse, we are to vnderstand the rule and do∣minion of Satan, who is the Prince of darknesse, and doth rule in the children of disobedience, by sinne, by ignorance
in the minde, rebellion in the will, prauity and hardnesse of the heart &e. Whence it is that actuall sinnes, are called by the Apostle, the workes of darknesse. The meaning then of the first part of this verse is this, who by the mighty and powerfull worke of his spirit hath drawen vs, wee nei∣ther desiring nor willing it of our selues, out of the rule of Satan the Prince of darkenesse, who ruleth by sinne, in the children of disobedience. Wee are to marke in the first place the order of this verse, in that the Apostle saith, first we are deliuered and then translated, Hence we may gather, that before wee can come to bee set into the state of grace and saluation,Before we can be set in∣to the state of grace, wee must be deli∣uered from the state of corruption. Eph 4.22. 2. Cor. 7.1. we must be deliue∣red from the state of corruption and sinne, a poynt easily prooued; euery exhortation of the Apostle, tending to reformation and newnesse of life, by way of implication doth confirme it, as that wee are to cast off the old man, which is corruption, through the deceiueable lusts &c. that we are to be clensed from all filthinesse of the flesh and spi∣rit, and to finish our sanctification in the feare of God, these and many other of like sort, doe not onely teach, that a change must bee wrought, but imply the order of it, that first we must be drawen out of the state of corruption and sinne,  and then set into the state of grace, the reason and ground of this is, because nature and grace, the image of God, and the image of Satan, can neuer stand together, the one must be razed out, before the other can be brought in; so long as we are in our naturall dregs and filthinesse, in the state of corruption we beare the image of Satan, and therefore cannot at the same time haue in vs, the renued image of God. Is it so that we must be drawne out of the state of sinne and corruption before wee bee set into the state of grace, then let this serue as a ground of examination and triall of our selues,Examination and triall of our selues. euery one will perswade himselfe that hee is in the state of grace, but would we know whether wee bee so or no, then looke to the first steppe and entrance into that
that state, examine whether thou hast suffered an holy and heauenly violence, whether the strong hand of grace hath wrought vpon thee, and drawne thee out of thy corrupti∣on, if thou find it so, then doubtlesse thou art in the state of Grace, but if otherwise thou neuer seltst any such pow∣erful work in thee, but if thou still liuest the life of nature, thou canst not with comfort perswade thy selfe that thou art in the state of grace, and for more speciall triall in this case looke to the working of Gods spirit in respect of the best pleasing sinne, euen of that sin to which thou art most naturally inclined, if thou finde that God by the power∣full worke of his spirit hath drawne thee from vnder the power and tyranny of that sinne, and that thou hast not now such pleasure in it as in former times, but dost striue by good meanes against it, and auoid occasions lea∣ding vnto it, then thou maist be sure, thou art entred into the way of life, but if thou finde, that yet thou art held in the snare of the deuill as the Apostle speakes,2. Tim. 2.26. in thraldome vnder that sinne, that so soone as any occasion is offered thou art ready to practise it, and that with pleasure, then heare and thinke on it, with trembling that euen Cain, Iu∣das or Herod were as neere heauen as thou art yet. Deliuered.) The point hence to be obserued is this, that  deliuerance of the naturall man from vnder the bondage of Satan is a most hard thing,Deliuerance of men from vnder naturall bondage is a most hard thing. it is such a thing as wee are taught by this word, as doth require the force and strength of that hand that is omnipotent, and able to ouermaster hell, yea such a thing as is wrought on him that is deliue∣red meerely passiue, nay repugnant and striuing against it being dead in sinne:Ephe. 2.1. it is not in this case as in producing the formes of many naturall things which are bought e po∣tentia materiae out of a capable pronenesse of the matter to conceiue such a forme, but that God which at first was a∣ble to bring light out of darkenesse,2. Cor. 4.6. the same God by the power of his spirit doth deliuer the mind from dulnesse & ignorance, the will from rebellion, the affections from dis∣order,
and all the powers of the soule from corruption, let no man then please himselfe with a conceit that hee can at  his owne time and pleasure bee deliuered from the bon∣dage of sinne and Satan,No man ought to think that he can at his owne time and pleasue be deliuered from the bon∣dage of sinne and Satan. that is to suffer our thoughts to rise vp in contradiction to the holy ghost, and in our harts to gainesay the trueth breathed out of the mouth of God himselfe, in this and many other places, let no man then please himselfe, in such a conceit so contrary to the plain truth plainly taught by our Sauior, & so neglect the time∣ly vsing of the meanes, as hearing and reading the word of God, and other meanes by which God doth worke the calling and and conuersion of his elect, and their deliue∣rance from the bondage of sinne and Satan. Wee are fur∣ther to marke that the Apostle saith, not from sinne and  Satan, but from the power of darknesse, from the power of Satan ruling by sinne,When men by the worke of grace are dawne out of the state of corruption they are deli∣uered not al∣together f om sin, but from the power of sinne. Reason. Rom. 6.12. our instruction hence is this, that when it pleaseth God by the powerfull worke of his grace to draw men out of the state of corruption, hee doth not deliuer them altogether from sinne, but from the power of sinne, so after their deliuerance, sinne doth not rule and raigne ouer them, and in them according to the exhortati∣on of the Apostle. Let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodies, the reason of it is this, the Lord will haue vs heere so long as we liue in this world to bee in continuall exer∣cise of faith and repentance, and spiritual grace & strength, therefore he doth not deliuer those whom it pleaseth him to call and conuert altogether from sinne, but from the power of sinne, that sinne doth not rule and raign in them, and this may serue as a speciall note and marke that can not deceiue vs, whereby we may know when wee are deli∣uered from our naturall state and condition,  namely when we are freed from the rule and dominion of sinne,For triall of ourselues touching our deliuerance from our na∣turall state. that though we sometimes fall into sinne, yet wee are not in bondage vnto it, and this may also serue to teach vs when we are deliuered from some particular sinne whereof wee are most guilty, euen then when wee finde the power of it broken.
But happily some will demand how we shal know that we are deliuered from the power of some particular sinne,  for herein some deceiue themselues, and falsly thinke they are deliuered, when they are not, as the vncleane adulte∣rous person enfeebled by sicknes or age, the prodigall ri∣otous person drawne dry in his purse, their minds still run∣ning after their sinne as much as euer before, they thinke they are deliuered from their particular sinne, these indeed are deliuered from the practise of sinne, but not from the power of their sinne. Then we are deliuered from the power of some particu∣lar sinne when we being able to commit it,  occasion being offered, and we being tempted vnto it, doe either with a loathing of it because it is sinne, and not for feare or shame of the world refraine from it, & if we fall into it, our fall is with reluctation and griefe as Paul saith of himselfe,Rom. 7.15. the euill hee hated hee did, and after the fall wee recouer our selues by speedy repentance, for where the seede of Grace hath taken roote, these three things are to be found; a pur∣pose not to sinne; and if we bee ouertaken with sinne,3. Things. little or no pleasure in the act of sinne; and bitter greefe of hart,  after we are fallen; as we read of Dauid, when he had num∣bred  the people his heart smote him.2. Sam. 24.10. Againe when wee  are not able to commit sinne for want of meanes and strength, wee may know that wee are deliuered from the power of it, if so be we looke not backe to it with pleasure, if we neither thinke nor speake of it but with bitter griefe: for surely such as thinke or speake of their olde familiar sin, which now they are not able to practise with delight, they are not deliuered from the power of it, they are like Lots wife, who though her body was deliuered out of So∣dome, yet her heart was still there, and therfore shee cast a long looke backe to that filthy sinke of sinne, and they are to remember Lots wife, it is the exhortation of our Saui∣our, that as she was smitten by the hand of God, and tur∣ned into a pillar of salt, so they first or last without repen∣tance
shall be smitten and made spectacles of the Lords wrath.Interpretatiō. Now to the second generall thing, in this verse in these words (and hath translated) the word (translated) is heere taken from the Latine, and signifieth through the effectu∣all working of the spirit of God, working by the word of the Gospell, carried and set ouer; (Kingdome of his Sonne) that is to say, into the Kingdome of Christ his natural son, his son by eternall generation in respect of his deity, and in respect of his humanity by personall vnion, and by the word (Kingdome) we are to vnderstand the regiment and gouernment of Christ, as mediatour in his Church, and because Christ his regiment is twofold, of grace and glory, we must know that heere is meant his kingdome of grace, whereby he doth order and rule his Church & the mem∣bers of it in this life, which in respect of the manner of go∣uernement shall haue an end at the second comming of Christ to iudgement.1. Cor, 15.24. For though Christ his kingdome it selfe be eternall, because he is God, equall to the father, and the head of his Church, yet the manner of the administra∣tion of his kingdome,Note. by preaching Sacraments and dis∣cipline shall haue an end he shall then cease to doe the of∣fice of a mediatour (but that by the way, (his deare sonne) that is to say, the sonne of his loue, so the words are in the originall his sonne,Mat. 3.17. in whome as we haue it, he is wel plea∣sed, thus then these words are to be conceiued, & through the powerfull worke of his spirit, working by his worde, hath brought and set vs vnder the regiment and gouern∣ment  of grace, whereby Christ his naturall sonne and the sonne of his loue,God doth not only deliuer his elect from the power of sinne, but sets them also into the state of grace. doth gouerne his Church in this life, Now the first thing wee haue heere to marke is from the connexion of the parts of this verse. The Apostle saith, he hath deliuered vs from the power of darkenesse and hath translated vs into the kingdome of his deare sonne, hence we may take vp this instruction that God doth not onely deliuer his elect from the power of sinne, but doth also set
them into the state of grace,Rom. 8.30. and hee doth not onely draw them out of the state of their corruption, but hee brings them vnder grace and workes, grace in them, for as the Apostle saith, whom he hath appointed to life and salua∣tion, them he calleth; now effectuall calling (which must needs be there vnderstood) being applied to Gods elect, is when gace is not onely offered by the ministerie of the word, but giuen through the effectuall working of Gods Spirit in the heart, hee changing the heart, and giuing it power to receiue the word, and to mix it with faith, and to bring foorth fruits of new obedience, for that is effectuall calling, and that doth plainly prooue that God doth not onely deliuer his elect from the power of sinne, but hee brings them vnder grace, and workes grace in them. We need seeke no further for the proofe of this, than the word heere vsed (translated) for translation is a setting of vs out of one state into another. The reason of this is because God will haue the minde,  will, and affections of his chosen, not onely free from euill, as a field purged of thistles and reedes, but hee will haue them actiue working and fruitfull in good∣nesse for them, they are sanctified when they are trans∣formed from the image of Sathan into the image of God: and thus they are truly renued when they are tur∣ned from sinne to God, and bring foorth fruits of new obedience. Let the consideration of this point for the vse  of it teach vs to know when we are effectually called,How to know when we are effe∣ctually called. and truly con∣uerted, namely then, when by the powerfull worke of Gods Spirit, our minds, wils, and affections, are not only freed from corruption, but grace is wrought in them: and to descend a little lower in the application of this point, then we are effectually called out of some sinne, and truly turned from some sinne, when we are not only kept from that sin, but with loue, liking, alacritie and cheerefulnesse, we practise the contrary duty, that is a rule that cannot de∣ceiue
vs; many please themselues, and thinke they are in good case, called home and reclaimed from some sinne, when they auoid that sinne: but we must know that is not sufficient;2. Pet. 2.20. the Apostle doth tell vs that some may escape from the filthinesse of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and of the Sauiour Iesus Christ, and yet bee tangled againe therein and ouercome, and the latter end be worse with them than the beginning. As many as will be sure they are effectually called home, so as they cannot goe backe againe to their old course, must not onely finde themselues deliuered from their sinne, but must also finde the contrary grace wrought in them, yea in some cases the contrary speciall grace: as for example, such as will be sure they are called out of their naturall blindnesse and igno∣rance of God, of themselues, of the way to life and saluati∣on, must not only finde their mindes enlightned by a ge∣nerall illumination, a bare conceiuing and vnderstanding of the sense and meaning of the word; that is a common grace, and that may be common to them with the Deuill, and the wicked, but they must find in them a special expe∣rimentall knowledge, a particular acknowledgement and perswasion of the truth of the whole word of God, a belee∣uing holy knowledge, which is neuer disioined from good affection, and then they may be sure they are effe∣ctually called out of their ignorance. Thus it is in other particulars. Let no man then imagine that he is effectually called home, when for a time he hath escaped the practise of some sin, vnlesse he can withall shew the practise of the contrary vertue. And to this purpose consider we but this one thing, that it is not possible for a man long to cōtinue in that barren and (as I may call it) graceles estate in which he doth please himselfe, if the sinne be auoided, and the contrary vertue not practised, it cannot be but that he will returne with the dogge to his vomit: for marke what our Sauiour hath left vpon perpetuall record:Mat. 12.44. When the vn∣cleane spirit is gone out of a man, if he returne (as he will
seeke to returne) and finde the house emptie, or as the word i, idle, not possessed by grace, certainly he will enter and hold possession with greater strength than before, and the latter end of that man will bee worse than his begin∣ning. In the next place wee are to marke, the Apostle saith,  translated into the Kingdome,Gods elect being deliue∣red from sin, and set into the state of grace, are still vnder gouern∣ment. that word (Kingdome) being a word of relation, hauing reference to subiects, it teacheth that Gods elect deliuered from sinne, and set into the state of grace, are still vnder gouernment, they are not at libertie to liue as they list: for why? the Kingdome of grace, as the Apostle reasoneth, giues no licence to sinne, that they that are vnder grace, should therefore sin; we are not vnder the Law, but vnder grace. What then? doth it follow that we should sinne? God forbid, saith the Apostle:Rom. 6.15. he speakes it with a detestation of that conclusion, as if he should haue said, fie vpon it, farre be it from vs. The Scripture is preg∣nant in the proofe of this: but for more speciall informa∣tion in this point, wee must know what be the lawes, vn∣der which Gods elect liue in this kingdome of grace: and they are two; first, the word of God,Mark. 1.14. Rom. 3.27. 1. Cor. 4.20. the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles. Hence is the Gospell called the Gospell of the Kingdome; the Law of faith. The se∣cond Law is the power and operation of the Spirit of God in the hearts of his children; the Apostle saith, the Kingdome of God is not in word, but in power; saith the Lord, I will put my Law into their inward parts,Ier. 31.33. and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. These being the Lawes of the kingdome of Christ in this life, all Gods elect set into the state of grace, are to be sub∣iect vnto them, and to finde them powerfull to worke in them obedience. They doe not onely teach vs vnder what manner of gouernment wee liue, but doe plainly prooue that wee are not at libertie to liue as we lift, but still vnder gouernment; for to that end is a law giuen, especi∣ally the law binding the conscience, as these doe, that it
should be obeied, and to retaine men within the compasse of dutie. Hence the lawes of men are truly called the si∣newes and holds of the common-wealth.Obiect. Gal. 5.1. But some may say, the Apostle hath taught vs, that we are set at libertie by Christ, stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not entangled againe with the yoke of bondage.  The answer is easie, by Christ as many as are in him haue libertie indeed, but it is spiritu∣all, not a carnall libertie: they haue freedome from the curse of the Law, and from the rigour of the Law, requiring exact and perfect obedience, and from the tyrannie and dominion of sinne; but they haue no libertie to sinne, and to liue as they list, that as the Apostle saith in the same chapter, vers. 13. is to vse their libertie as an occasion vnto the flesh. This then remaines a truth, that Gods elect de∣liuered from the power of sinne, and set in the state of grace, are still vnder gouernment. And for the vse of this, let euery one hence learne to reason backe againe, that if he be not subiect to the Lawes of Christ his kingdome, and ruled in some measure by his Word and Spirit, then he is not deliuered from the power of sinne,If wee be not ruled by the word and spi∣rit of Christ, wee are not deliuered from the power of sin. nor in the state of grace. And a little further to presse this, can we perswade our selues we are in the state of grace, and vndergrace, and yet abuse grace, make it an occasion to all licentious libertie to sin, make it as a bawd to our lying, swearing, drunkennesse, &c. If wee doe but waigh this in the ballance of naturall reason, it will bee found too light to this purpose; for as we vse to say, when a man doth sell a thing of great worth for a small price, and after that giues himselfe to rioting and mispending of that mony, he is a theefe, and no right owner of that hee sold, the like may be iustly said of such as abuse grace, that they are but vsurpers, & no right owners of it, & that they haue no true lawfull title vnto it. Let this be thought on, and withall remember what wee daily call for, or ought to call for, at the hands of God, namely this, that this kingdome
may be set vp and established in the Church, and in our owne hearts. And if we doe not withall labour to submit our selues to the scepter of his kingdome, the rule of his word and spirit, but wilfully reiect his yoke, wee pray a∣gainst our selues, wee desire the Lord to take vs away, to confound and destroy vs by his iudgements, that his king∣dome may increase, and of our owne mouthes will the Lord iudge vs, and in his iust conceiued anger accomplish that we aske. Therefore with trembling hearts let vs con∣sider, and in time submit our selues to the kingdome of Christ. Before I leaue this word (Kingdome) I will briefly answer a cauill of the Anabaptists, who vpon this, and the like places of Scripture, take occasion to mainetaine a con∣fused Anarchy, and to reason against ciuill gouernment a∣mongst Christians, after this manner, Gods elect (say they) effectually called and set in the state and kingdome of grace, are gouerned by Christ the King,A cauill of the Anabap∣tists answered and by the Lawes of his kingdome, his Word and Spirit. Therefore they need not outward gouernment of man, outward go∣uernment by a magistrate is needelesse; this is a meere ca∣uill, hauing no soundnesse in it: it is easily answered, for if we should but presse them with the perpetuity of the fifth commandement, that requiring subiects to yeeld obedi∣ence to the gouernours, and that being eternall, they are not able to reply: but in a word to answer them; In the vi∣sible Church are not onely true beleeuers, but hypocrites, as we are taught in many parables in the Gospell, who are not gouerned by Gods spirit, but by their owne corrupt lusts, therefore in respect of them, ciuill gouernment is needfull; yea, the best Churches in the world neede ciuill gouernment, for the punishment of euill doers, and to say there needes no ciuill gouernment, it inclines to that old rotten condemned heresie, that God was not the author of the old Testament, because there we finde so many pu∣nishments mentioned and executed. Againe, true belee∣uers ought to bee a Law and a Magistrate to themselues,
and so to liue as not to neede the ciuill maiestrate, but yet they doe not, neither can doe being but in part gouerned by the Spirit for the time of this life, therefore also in re∣spect of them, for the ordering of the outward man, ciuill gouernment is necessarie; and to this we may adde, that it is necessary for the protection of the Church, it being o∣pen to the malice of Satan & the wicked.1. Tim. 2.2. Hence the Apo∣stle bids vs pray for kings, and all that be in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life vnder them, in all godlinesse and honesty. It followeth, the next thing to be marked is, that the Apostle saith, God doth ttanslate his Elect into the kingdome of his Sonne, hee saith not vnto his owne Kingdome, though the kingdome of the Sonne (if we respect the Kingdome it selfe) is the Kingdome of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, it is a power of the whole Trinity, for the power to make lawes binding con∣science to be obeied vpon paine of life and death, is a pow∣er of the whole Trinity; but the administration of it, is gi∣uen vnto the Sonne, as himselfe witnesseth, all power is giuen vnto me in Heauen and in earth,Mat. 28.18. therefore he giues commission to his Apostles immediately from himselfe to goe teach and administer the Sacraments, but the rea∣son why the Apostle saith, translated into the Kingdome of his Sonne, and not vnto his own kingdome, is because God the Father doth admit no man to himselfe immediately but by the Sonne God and man, the true and onely Me∣diator betweene God and man, as our Sauiour saith; No man commeth vnto the Father,Ioh. 14.6 but by me. The point hence following is this that no man is vnder the speciall gouernment of God,No man is vnder Gods speciall go∣uernment, but he that is in the King∣dome of his Sonne. Psal. 29.10 no man is gouerned by the speciall grace of God, but he that is in the Kingdome of his Sonne, euen a member of the Church, and ordered and ruled by him. It is certaine the vniuersall gouernment and prouidence of God is ouer all creatures, in him they liue, mooue, and haue their being, euen all in heauen and in earth, yea the damned in hell, thus the Lord remaineth
a King for euer, but none are gouerned by his speciall grace, that is to say, his grace whereby hee doth restraine and mortifie corruption, and daily renew his decayed i∣mage in the minde, will and affections, but onely such as are in Christ, such as are effectually caled and iustified by Christ. We haue proofe of this, where the Apostle sayth, when the Ephesians were without Christ,Ephes 2.12. they were with∣out God, his meaning is not onely without the true know∣ledge and worship of God, and such as did neglect both; but such as were neglected, and not regarded of God, in respect of his speciall gouernment, and suffered to walk in their owne waies and sinnes, and to follow the lusts of their owne hearts, for wee may easily conceiue, that the words may extend to that meaning, if wee compare them with that we read, vers. 19. of that chapter, that in Christ they were made citizens with the Saints, and of the house∣hold of God, which wordes imply speciall care and go∣uernment, as a wise and good housholder hath a speciall care ouer them of his family; so the Lord being wisdome and goodnesse it selfe, without question hath a speciall care, and doth carry a speciall hand ouer them that bee of his family; will wee haue some strength of reason to con∣firme this, then know and consider we, that Gods speciall grace is most free, and not giuen vpon any desert of ours,  but on the free and gratious promise of God, now all the promises of God to his children touching vocation, iusti∣fication,2. Cor. 1.20. renouation &c. are made and fulfilled in Christ alone, he is the foundation and complement of them all,  in him they are all, yea and Amen.Such as desire speciall grace to mortifie sinne, and to renew Gods image in them, must labour to be∣come mem∣bers of Christ. Hence it followeth strongly, that none are euer gouerned by the special grace of God, but such as bee in Christ, because the promise is made and fulfilled in him and by him. The point thus cleared, let vs further thinke on it, to this speciall purpose, is it so, that none are gouerned by the speciall grace of God, but such as are in Christ, then euery one that desires speciall grace for the mortification of sin,
and for renewing the image of God in him, must labour to be made a member of Christ, let him not suffer his eyes to sleepe, nor the temples of his head to take any rest, till he be assured, that hee is set into the body of Christ, and made one with him by the bond of his spirit, and by a true faith, and to this purpose know it, that as long as wee are out of Christ, we cannot pray vnto God with assurance of his speciall grace, for faith and assurance to be heard, hath euer respect to the promise, and there is no promise, no, not of any temporary good thing to them, that are out of Christ, they that be out of Christ, they cannot truely be∣leeue, they may boldly presume, they cannot truly beleeue that they shall receiue any temporary good thing from the Lord, if they doe, it is but as if a man should thinke to hould the wind in his fist; true faith euer hath relation to the promise, and out of Christ there is no promise, they that bee out of Christ, come to an absolute God, hence it is, that many pray to God to giue them grace to refraine some sinne being conuinced of it, in their owne con∣science and told of it, they promise amendment, yea, they pray to God to giue them grace to refraine from it, and yet faile to obtaine, because they are out of Christ, whereas if they were in Christ, effectually called and iusti∣fied, they should receiue Saint Pauls answer, and finde it made good vnto them, though they were not freed from temptation to that sinne, yet they should finde Gods grace sufficient for them, and this ought to stirre vs vp to labour by all good meanes, to bee ioyned with Christ, by the bond of his Spirit, and by a true and liuely faith, and then we may be sure, if we pray for Gods speciall grace, we shall haue it giuen vnto vs; for can or will God suffer vs, to whom hee hath vouchsafed the bloud of his own Sonne, to runne headlong into sinne? certainely no, hee will not wee may finde that God hath vouchsafed his common re∣straining grace to some Heathen men, as to Abimelech. God saith hee kept him that hee should not sinne against
him, therefore he will not cast away the humble petition of his chosen being now actuall members of Christ; no doubtlesse, they crauing grace, he will giue them his spe∣ciall grace, not only restraining, but mortifying their cor∣ruption, and renuing them in holinesse after his owne i∣mage, let this then be a speciall inducement to mooue vs, to labour to be made members of Christ, and let vs gather yet further argument to mooue vs to bee made one with Christ out of this very text: the Apostle saith, Gods elect effectually called, are translated into the kingdome of his deare sonne, that is, the sonne of his loue, in whom hee is well pleased: euen well pleased, not onely with him, but in him with all his members, and that this may be matter to mooue vs, consider how happy and blessed a thing it is to be made deare vnto God, it is the verie depth & ground of all true comfort, for then wee haue peace with God, with our owne conscience, with all the faithfull, yea with all the creatures in the world, the very beasts and stones of the field are then in league with vs, we then haue accesse to the throne of grace with boldnes,Phil. 3.8. we are assured of Gods speciall presence and protection, we may come into Gods house with ioy and gladnesse, we haue title to all the bles∣sings of Gods Saints in this life, and right to eternall happines in the life to come. Seeing then such is the excel∣lency of our beeing made neere and deare to God by Christ. This ought to possesse our hearts with S. Pauls af∣fection, to thinke all things losse that we may win Christ, and bee found in him, and by him bee made neere and deare to his Father,Iob 5.23. and so pertakers of all the comforts and blessings of Gods Saints in this life, and in the life to come.
VER. 14. In whom we haue redemption through his bloud that is, the forgiuenesse of sinnes. In this verse is contained a manifestation of the worker of saluation (Iesus Christ) and the worke wrought by him (Redemption.) More particularly we may obserue in this verse three things. Three things in this vers to be obserued.First, in whom Gods elect haue redemption, namely in Iesus Christ, in those words (in whom.) Secondly, the meanes of their owne redemption (his bloud.) Thirdly, of what manner of redemption the Apostle speakes: euen of redemption from their sinnes, in the last words, where the Apostle saith by way of exposition, that is, (the forgiuenesse of sinne.) Let vs a little examine the words: (In whom) that is in Christ the sonne of God, for these words haue reference to the last words of the verse,Interpre∣tation. foregoing, his deare sonne, (redemption) to redeeme in a large and generall acception, signifieth to set free some captiue, or some that are oppressed, out of the handes of their enemies or oppressor. Now because such deliuerance may either be by strong hand, as God redeemed his peo∣ple out of Aegypt, and as Abraham redeemed Lot, or by ransome, we are heere to vnderstand deliuerance by ran∣some, for so the originall word doth signifie, and the Apo∣stle restraines it to that,1 Tim. 26. and saith in plaine termes, that he gaue himselfe a ransome for all. This seemes contrarie to many places of Scripture, where it is said, that Christ redeemed vs out of the hands of our enemies, by ouercomming them, 2. Chapt. of this Epistle 15. verse, how then did he deliuer vs by ransome or price? In respect of God his Father, to whom he offered him∣selfe without spot, he deliuered vs by ransome. But in re∣spect of Satan, who had vs captiues vnder sinne, the curse,
death and damnation, he deliuered vs by strong hand, he destroyed through death him that had the power of death that the Deuil had deliuered them which for fear of death were all their life time subiect to bondage.Hebr. 2.14. It will be further obiected,Ob. if we were in bondage vnto Satan and his captiues, then the price of our redemption was paid to him and not to God, for the ransome is com∣monly paid to him who hath the captiues vnder his hand. We were properly captiues to the iustice of God in the Law; and the curse of the Law,  and vnto Satan but as the minister of God for the execution of the curse, and so the price of redemption was paid to God to satisfie his iu¦stice to which we were properly in captiuity, not to Satan who was but the minister of Gods iustice as the Iayler and tormenter for the afflicting of punishment (through his bloud) that is his bloudy death and passion, his accursed death of the crosse, therefore the Apostle calls it verse 10. the bloud of his crosse through the sacrifice of himselfe of∣fered vpon the crosse, by forgiuenesse of sinnes in the last place, we are to vnderstand deliuerance from the guilt and punishment of all sinnes. Thus then these words are to be conceiued. In which, or by which Sonne of God Christ Iesus, we haue deliuerance from the guilt and punishment of all our sins, by the ransome of his death as a price paid to God his Father to satisfie his iustice, before we come to such things as may be hence obserued I wil briefly answer a doubt for satisfaction of some, who happily may mooue the question and not be able to resolue themselues. The doubt is this,  how this text can agree with that where God is said to redeeme his people. I answere; we must know and hold it for a truth,  it is a common receiued rule in Diuinity that all the workes of the Trinity ad extra are common to the whole Trinity, God the Father Son and holy Ghost, worke together euen in this worke of our redemption, but yet Christ the mat∣ter of our saluation is said by a matter of excellency to bee
our onely redeemer,Christ a re∣deemer in 3. respects. and that in a threefold respect. First, because he only is God and man, for it was neces∣sary  that our redeemer should be God and man. Secondly, he was only deputed to the office of a redee∣mer. Thirdly, he onely had right not only of propriety, but of propinquity and nerenesse of flesh and bloud vnto vs, according to the Law. Hence it is said that he tooke part with the children of God in flesh and bloud. Thus we see though redemption be a worke common vnto the whole trinity,Leuit 25.49. Heb. 2.14. yet by an excellency Christ is our onlie redeemer, and in him alone we haue redemption, because he is God and man deputed to that office, and had right of propin∣quity and neerenesse vnto vs; we are heere to marke the Apostle placeth redemption in the remission of sins (In whom we haue redemption): hence followes this conclusion that none are redeemed by the death of Christ, but onely  Gods elect, I will labour to make this plaine, remission of sinnes is a part of iustification in the sight of God.None are re∣deemed by Christ but on∣ly Gods elect. And none are iustified in Gods sight but those whom he prede∣stinate, for none haue faith whereby they apprehend and applie Christ to their iustification in his sight, but such as were preordained to life & saluation. Now then redemp∣tion being heere placed in remission of sinnes, and remis∣sion of sins being a part of iustification in the sight of God, heereupon it followes necessarily that none are redeemed by the death of Christ,Act. 13.45. but onely Gods elect. Againe, if we should say Christ died for al, elect and reprobate, then this would follow that hee died for some who now are frying in the fire of hell, which is a most absurd conclusion euen contumelious and blasphemous against Christ, it is as much as to say that Christ died for some and after that was not able to bring them to life and saluation, the Apo∣stle hath taught vs that hee gaue himselfe for his Church,Eph. 5.25.26. and the true members of it that hee migh sanctifie it and cleanse it, and so make it meete for his kingdome of glory.
But will some say,  it is no such absurdity to say that Christ died for some, and redeemed some who shall bee damned, it is the speech of the Apostle, where hee saith, some shall bring in damnable heresies, euen denying the Lord which hath bought them,2. Peter 2.1. and bring vpon them∣selues swift damnation. Wee are to vnderstand these words (that bought them) as spoken not according to the iudgement of infallibiity,  and of infallible certainety, but according to their owne iudgement and the iudgement of others led by the rule of charity; for to expound the words otherwise, and to say they were in deed & truth redeemed, were to make Christ a redeemer of some neither freed from the power of sinne in this life, nor from the power of hell in the life to come, contrary to many plaine places of the Scripture. It will be further said,  wee read in many places of the Scripture that Christ redeemed the world, God was in Christ and reconciled the world to himselfe,2. Cor. 5.19. nor imputing their sinnes vnto them, and hath committed to vs the word of reconciliation.1. Iohn. 2.2. Hee is the reconciliation for our sinnes, and not for ours only, but also for the sinnes of the whole world. Againe,  the word (world) in the new Testament hath many acceptions, I will not stand to repeat them, but in the places alleadged it signifieth the elect of God in the world as plainly appeares, God so loued the world that he hath giuen his onely begotten sonne,Iohn 3.6. that whosoeuer be∣leeueth in him should not perish, but haue euerlasting life, for God doth embrace none but his elect in his eternall loue:1. Tim. 2.6. the antecedent cause of sending his sonne into the world. If any yet further say we read that Christ gaue himselfe a ransome for all men, to be a testimony in due time. The answer is this not all and euery particular man,  but all sorts of men, men of all states, conditions and callings as it is said of our Sauiour that he healed euery disease: the
meaning is, not euery particular disease, but all sorts of diseases. So then notwithstanding these obiections, it remaines a firm truth that none are redeemed by the death of Christ but onely Gods elect:Confutation of that opiniō that Christ died for all, both elect & reprobate. this might be pressed to the confu∣tation of such as hold the contrary opinion, namely that Christ his death is not only sufficient but effectuall for all, both the chosen of God and them also that are reiected of God, and that some notwithstanding the death of Christ are condemned, they hold that comes to passe not for their sinnes, as being truly satisfied for, by Christ, but for their vnbeleefe, by which they doe againe make the re∣conciliation made betweene God and them void, and of none effect, which is an opinion vtterly vntrue, but I will not further stand to refute it. Let the application of the doctrine now prooued be to this purpose,It is a meere fancy that there is vni∣uersall re∣demption by Christ. to teach vs that it is but a fond imagination, and a foolish thing for vs, to thinke that there is an vniuer∣sall redemption by Christ, and that he died for all, as some vainely shroud themselues vnder this, without reason or ground, when they are conuinced of sinne, and forced to confesse that they are greeuous sinners, then they flie to this, Christ died for all; many leane to this staffe of reede, and deceiue themselues. We must learne to acknowledge ad embrace this truth, and bee resolued of it, that Christ died only for Gods Elect effectually, & if we will haue cō∣fort by his death, & by the doctrin of redemptiō wrought by him, we must labour to finde our selues in the number of the redeemed,  and be able to say with our Apostle in this place,  that in Christ wee haue redemption. How is that to bee done may some say? Wouldest thou know how thou mayest finde comfort in the redemption wrought by Christ: then take this for our infallible rule grounded on the worde of God, that Christ redeemeth men not onely from deserued condemnation, but also from their vaine conuersation. To whomsoeuer Christ is
a Sauiour and Redeemer, by merit procuring the pardon of sinne, to him he is a Sauiour by efficacy also, by turning his heart from sinne to God; it is plainely propounded, that Christ gaue himse fe to redeeme, and to purge;Tit. 2.14. the proposition is copulatiue not disiunctiue, and it is the rule of reason, that if one part of the copulatiue proposition be false, the other also is false; if then thou wouldest know whether Christ hath redeemed thee from the guilt and pu∣nishment of sinne, looke into thy selfe, and see whether he hath purged thee from the filthinesse of sinne; if thou be not purged from the filthinesse of sinne, out of al question thou art not redeemed from iniquity,Note. hee that is not by Christ his death turned from sinne, is not by it redeemed from the punishment of sinne, from hell, death and con∣demnation. In that the Apostle saith, the bloud of Christ, that is, the death of Christ, the death of the Crosse, being an accursed death,Gal 3.13. a death ioined with the malediction of the Law. Was Christ the meanes of our redemption and deliue∣rance,  from the guilt and punishment of sinne?The greatnes of sinne is knowne by the death of Christ. Hence we learne to know the horrible greatnesse of sin, it being such as no creature in the world, neither Angel nor Saint, no not all Angels or Saints were able to appease the wrath of God, and to satisfie his iustice for it, but onely the death of his own deare Son, no nor as the doting Friers do dreame, one drop of the bloud of Christ, let fal from his finger, had beene sufficient to redeeme vs, no punishment but death, euen the cursed death of the crosse, was sufficient to that purpose. Let vs then looke on Christ crucified,  by the eye of faith, and we shall see the fearefull and vgly face of sinne,Wee are to looke vpon Christ cruci∣fied, that wee may see the vgly face of sine. that God hates it with endlesse hatred, in that nothing would satisfie his wrath for it, but the precious bloud of his deare Sonne, and that powred out by the cursed death of the Crosse; men commonly esteeme some sinnes but light and trifling, as customarie swearing, breaking the
Sabbath, idlenesse, wanton iesting, &c. But wee must know that these are of such waight, as they pulled downe the Sonne of God, from his throne of Maiestie and glorie, and caused him to humble himselfe to death, and to suffer the cursed death of the Crosse, and to poure out his most precious blould for our redemption, there was no meanes to redeeme vs from our sinne, but the death of the Sonne of God, therefore learne we to make conscience of euerie sinne, (through his bloud) I might heere enter into the question, and speake at large of it, whether Christ suffered in soule or no, but I hold it not so profitable to stand vpon that point; onlie in a word know we thus much, that what∣soeuer Christ tooke of our nature, hee tooke it to this end, to suffer in it, and by suffering to saue and redeeme it. And againe, wherein Adam and we properly sinne, by the same Christ the second Adam made satisfaction for sinne. But Christ tooke the whole nature of man, bodie and soule, and both Adam and we commit sinne both in bodie and soule. Christ verily and properly suffered in soule.Therefore, no doubt Christ verily and properly suffered in soule, as he endured paines and torments in his flesh; I will not further enlarge this. Come wee to some other point of further instruction, we are to marke, the Apostle saith, Gods elect haue redemption, that is, forgiuenesse of sinnes, deliuerance from the guilt and punishment of their sinnes, through the bloud of Christ, that is, his bloudy death. The point of instruction hence offered is this, that the meanes and meritorious cause of remission of sins,The meanes and meritori∣ous cause of remission of sins is Christ his body bro∣ken and his bloud shed. is not the body and bloud of Christ it selfe, abstracted and con∣sidered apart from his passion, but his body broken and his bloud shed, his painefull suffering, his bearing in body and soule the extremitie of Gods wrath, we need not seeke farre for proofe of this, the Apostle saith in this chap. ver 20. reconciliation was wrought by him of all things to himselfe, and to that he set at peace through the bloud of
his crosse, both the things in earth & the things in heauen, ver, 22. In the body of his flesh through death,Heb. 9.22. and wee haue it in expresse words, that without shedding of bloud, there is no remission, he saith not without bloud, but with∣out shedding of bloud, the reason and ground of this is, be∣cause the Law of God being broken, & God being offen∣ded by sinne, nothing could satisfie his iustice,  but punish∣ment suffered, eyther by the party offending, or by some other for him, for the breach and transgression of the Law, is the curse annexed. Therfore no satisfaction without pu∣nishment and vndergoing of the curse. Hence it followes necessarily, that not the body and bloud of Christ consi∣dered apart from his passion, but his body broken and his bloud shed vpon the crosse, is the meanes and meritorious cause of remission of sinne,  it may be demanded how the breaking of the body of Christ, & how Christ his suffering could bee a sufficient meritorious cause procuring remissi∣on of sins, seeing we by sin had deserued eternall death & punishment in hell for euer, & Christ his suffering was but for a time? I answer,  wee are not to esteeme the merit and efficacy of Christ his death by the time of his suffering, but by the person who suffered, namely, Christ both God and man, vnited into one person, & by vertue of his God-head, he gaue power to his death to be meritorious, euen of infi∣nite price and value, the Apostle prooues this in the verses following, and for further warrant of it, read Acts 20.28. It is there saide, that God hath purchased his Church with his owne bloud, not that God can suffer or shed bloud, but we are thus to conceiue it, that Christ suffered onely as hee was man, yet because of the personall vnion of God and man in Christ, it is said, that God shed his bloud, giuing vs to vnderstand the infinite merit & sufficiency of his death. The poynt thus prooued, come we to apply it;Confutation of popish transubstan∣tiation. and first is this a truth, that the meanes and meritorious cause of re∣mission of sins, is not the body & bloud of Christ a part frō his death then what vse is left of popish transubstantiation
for which the Papists much contend, if wee should grant vnto them,Iohn 6.63. which they are neuer able to prooue, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament, are turned into the sub∣stance of Christ his body & bloud; yet what profit should come by that bodily presence? surely none, by the sen∣tence of our Sauior himselfe the flesh profits nothing. Bel∣larmines owne confession is, that a man may eat the flesh of Christ, and drinke his bloud after a corporall manner, and yet profit himselfe nothing at all. (If they say) (as indeed they do) that the body of Christ crucified, and his bloud that was shed on the crosse is in the Sacrament vnder the forme of bread and wine. I answer againe, let this also be granted which can neuer bee proued, yet that body crucified and that bloud shed is not profitable without the merit of his death and passion apprehended and applied by the mouth of the soule, namely by faith. And so though we grant a reall presence of the body of Christ crucified, yet that is not profitable without the merit of his death apprehended by faith. If they say the body of Christ crucified reallie present, and the merit of his death euer goe together, in respect of the receiuers of the Sacrament, and that they that receiue the one really present receiue the other, then they fall into a foule absurdity, then they make it an idle distinction of the Apostle that some are worthy and some vnworthy re∣ceiuers then all good and bad, beleeuing and vnbeleeuing, euen such (as the Apostle hath taught vs) that eat & drink their owne damnation, they receiue the bodie and bloud of Christ really present, and withall the merit of his death, and so are fedde and nourished to eternall life which as yet is not begunne in them, and it may bee they shall neuer come vnto it, and that is a grosse absurditie. Thus we see though we grant a real presence, euen of the crucified bo∣dy of Christ yet there is no vse nor profit comes by that bodily presence, and by consequent the popish doctrine of transubstantiation falls to the ground, because God hath
ordained nothing in his Church, either idle or superstii∣ous: to come neerer to our selues, is it so, that the meritori∣ous cause of the remission of sins is not the body & blood of Christ considered apart from his passion, but his body broken, and his bloud shed vpon the Crosse; we must then know that it is not sufficient for vs to vnderstand, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament are signes of the body and bloud of Christ, for the body and bloud of Christ are not profitable abstracted from the worke done in his bo∣dy; many in their simplicity and weakenesse, thinke they are suffciently instructed in the matter of receiuing the Sacrament, if being asked they be able to answer, that the bread signifieth the body of Christ, & the wine his bloud, but we must know this is not sufficient, wee are further to  take knowledge of it,It is sufficient to vnderstand that the bread and wine in the sacrament are signes of the body and bloud of Christ. that bread and wine in the Sacra∣ment, are memorials and remembrances of the body of Christ broken and of his bloud shed and powred out on the Crosse for the remission of sinnes, wee are not to seuer the remembrance of his body from his death and passion, but together with the remembrance of his body, wee are to remember his painefull and meritorious suffering in his body and soule the wrath of God for our sinnes, and when we eat the bread and drinke the wine of the Sacrament, we are then at the very same instant to lift vp our harts to hea∣uen, and by Faith to feed vpon the body of Christ bro∣ken, and by faith to apprehend and apply the infinite me∣rit of his death and passion to our owne foules, particular∣ly for the pardon of our sinnes. If wee content our selues with receiuing the bread & wine as signes of the body and bloud of Christ thought vpon and considered apart from his passion we then make the receipt of the Sacrament vn∣profitable vnto vs, and very dangerous and hurtfull for them, we receiue the signe without the thing signified, for if we receiue not the whole thing signified, wee receiue it not at all, and so we prophane the signe, and as much as is in vs trample the bloud of Christ vnder our feet, wee eate
and drinke our owne damnation, we hasten some heauie iudgement of God vpon vs. Yea howsoeuer wee seeme to disclaime all Poperie, yet thus receiuing of the bread and wine in the Sacrament, as sinnes of the bodie and bloud of Christ neuer remembring the suffering of Christ in his body, we therein giue place to a popish opinion, and to a distinction by them newly deuised that the Sacrament is a remembrance of Christ and not of his death. Let vs then learne our dutie that when we come to receiue the Sacra∣ment, we are then by faith to feed on the body of Christ broken, and on his bloud shed on the Crosse. Come we to the last words (that is the forgiuenesse of our sinnes) we are to marke that the Apostle makes re∣demption and remission of sinnes equiualent, of equall reach and signification, in respect of Gods elect, that they that are redeemed by the bloud of Christ, haue by it remis∣sion of their sinnes, he expounds the one by the other. The conclusion hence following is this, that as many as by the worke of the holy Ghost beleeue in Christ and ap∣prehend and apply the merit of his death,Such as truely apprehend & apply the me∣rit of Christ his death haue full & perfect remission of their sinnes. Heb. 10, 4 haue full and perfect remission of their sinnes; for why? by the death of Christ they haue perfect redemption, with one offering hath hee consecrated or made perfect for euer those that are sanctified, and heere redemption and remission of sins are made conuertible termes, that through the bloudy death of Christ we haue redemption, that is, remission of sinnes, therefore it must needs follow, that as many as tru∣lie apprehend the merit of Christs death haue perfect re∣mission of their sinnes.Note. This will further appeare if wee consider after what manner sinne is forgiuen, and that is by an action of God, whereby for the merit of Christ hee accounts sinne as no sinne, or as if it were neuer commit∣ted, and as a debt discharged, for so much is implied in that petition, forgiue vs our trespasses or debts, forgiuenesse of sinne being an action of God, it must needes bee most per∣fect, for all the actions of God are most perfect, againe, is it
for the merit of Christ, how then can it bee any way defe∣ctiue; Christ his merit being infinite, and euery way an∣swerable to the iustice of God? Can remission of sin pro∣cured by it be vnperfect? it is not possible, wee may then safely conclude, that as many as truely apprehend and ap∣ply the merits of Christs death haue full and perfect remis∣sion of their sinnes, where then is any place for that popish distinction of remission of the fault, and not of the punish∣ment?Consutation of that popish distinction of the fault par∣doned and the punish∣ment reteined  So the Papists teach that for the merit of Christ his death, God doth pardon the fault, and the eternall pu∣nishment of sinne, but hee retaines a temporarie punish∣ment to be inflicted on them that haue sinned: this distin∣ction cannot stand with the truth now deliuered and pro∣ued, for if we haue perfect remission of sinnes, then both of the fault and punishment, or else we haue but halfe mai∣med and imperfect remission. A little further to discouer the weakenesse, and indeed the wickednesse of this popish doctrine, consider we these reasons. First, besides the relation that is between the fault and  the punishment, (the punishment euer hauing a relation to a foregoing fault, and in respect of the fault, is the pu∣nishment inflicted) besides this, we shall find in many pla∣ces of the Scripture,Leu. 20.19.20 such affinitie and so neere agreement between the fault & the punishment, as that these two they are taken sometimes one for the other. They shall beare their iniquitie, that is to say, the punishment of their ini∣quity. He bare our sinnes in his body on the tree,1 Pet. 2.24. that is to say, the punishment of our sinnes: for the Apostle in that speach of his had an eye to that,Isai. 53.5. he was wounded for our transgressions, hee was broken for our iniquities, the chastisements of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes are we healed. Heereby then would the holy Ghost haue vs to vnderstand that the fault and punishment of sinne cannot be so farre disioyned and so drawne asunder as the popish sort would haue them, that the one should be pardoned, and the other still retained.
Againe, if God inflict any punishment on him whose fault is remitted, and on him whose sinnes are taken away by the bloud of Christ (for so speakes the Scriptures.Iohn 1.29. Be∣hold the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world,) then he is vniust, but farre be it from vs so to thinke, it is all one as to require the paiment and satisfa∣ction of a debt forgiuen, which whosoeuer doth is vniust. If then they will not lay that imputation vpon the Lord, which they would be loath to lay vpon a miserable mor∣tall and sinnefull man, they must not charge him with pu∣nishing any sinne that he hath forgiuen. Thirdly, if this be true, that when God doth not remit sin he retaines the punishment of it, then it followeth ne∣cessarily on the contrary, that when hee doth forgiue the sinne he doth not retaine the punishment of it. To this we may ioine many plaine places of Scripture, where it is said, the Lord doth not impute sinne, but couer it, that he will not remember the sinnes of his chosen any more, but cast them behinde his backe, that hee will take them away like a cloud, drowne them in the bottome of the sea, and many other speaches wee find of like sort: all which concurre and meet together in this point of truth, and of sweet comfort, that the Lord for the precious me∣rit of the bloud of Christ doth pardon as well the punish∣ment, as the sinne of his chosen, for as one saith truely and well to this purpose, if the Lord impute not, he punisheth not, if he remember not, he reuengeth not, if he couer, he cals not to iudgement, if hee cast behinde his backe, he ex∣amines not; let not then any distinction deuised by the Popish sort, so contrary to the iustice of God, and the plain euidence of the word of God, strippe vs of that excellent comfort we may find in this, that by the death of Christ, as many as truly apprehend and apply it to themselues haue full and perfect remission of sinne, and freedome from all punishments temporall and eternall.Exception. But against this they except, that some whose sinnes are pardoned, haue not∣withstanding;
sicknesse, pouerty, contempt, yea death in∣flicted on them. Therefore (say they) though sinne bee forgiuen, yet the temporall punishment is not remoued? These things spoken of and the like,  to them that bee in Christ, and by him haue the pardon of their sinnes, are cor∣rections, fatherly chastisements, and tokens of Gods loue whom he loueth he chastiseth, not punishments of sinne forgiuen,Hebr. 12. nor proceeding from an angry and displeased God. Againe, they are laid on the deere children of God to worke in them amendment and care to auoid sinne, and for the exercise of Faith, the triall of patience, the stirring vp of some languishing graces that are in them, and for o∣ther good ends, and not to satisfie for the temporall pu∣nishment: admit they were properly and truely punish∣ments (which cannot bee prooued) yet could they neuer answer and satisfie the iustice of God, for to satisfie God is not onely to pay that we owe vnto him, but it doth inferre and imply full reconciliation with God; and a pacification of his anger, and that God is well pleased with him that doth satisfie. Now the suffering of punishment cannot so satisfie God if it be considered by it selfe, for then the dam∣ned in hel suffering punishment should satisfie God, which is most false, therfore the person that must satisfie God by suffering punishment must be considered, and he must be more then a meere man, euen God & man not able to vn∣dergoe the punishment,Mat. 3.17. but also such a one in whom God the Father is well pleased, as himselfe doth witnesse from heauen. So then though we grant that sicknes, pouerty and such like were punishments; yet could they not satisfie the iustice of God, because the suffering of punishment cōside∣red by it selfe doth not satisfie God vnles the person suffe∣ring be more then a meer man euen God & man & such a one in whom God is wel pleased. Howsoeuer then true be∣leeuers haue sicknes, pouerty & such like laid vpon them, yet we must know they are laid on thē as fatherly chastise∣ments and corrections, or as trialls for the exercise of their
faith & patience, for the stirring vp of the good graces that be in them, & not as punishments: & if they were laide on them as punishments, yet could they not satisfie the iustice of God. And therefore we are not to suffer our selues to be drawn from this trueth, full of sweet comfort, that by the bloudy death of Christ, al that truly lay hold of the merit of it, haue full and perfect remission of their sins, and free∣dome from all punishments temporall and eternall. Againe is it so, that by the bloud of Christ we haue per∣fect remission both of fault and punishment.Our duety is wholly to for∣giue the of∣fences of our brethren. Let then as many of vs as truely beleeue it, learne our duty following vpon it, and that is this, when wee forgiue the offences of our brethren, we are wholly to forgiue them, euen vtterly to forgoe all malice against offendours, or offences against vs.Eph. 4.32. It is plainely taught by the Apostle, forgiuing one ano∣ther, euen as God for Christ his sake forgaue you. How doth God for Christ his sake forgiue vs? wee haue heard it deli∣uered and prooued euen fully and perfectly, therefore we must take heed of mincing the matter, and of halfe remis∣sion to our brerhren, forgiuing some part of the offence, and carrying a peece vnforgiuen; O euill seruant, saith our Sauiour in the Parable,Mat. 18.32. I forgaue thee not a peece but all, and as I had pity on thee, so certainely, thy pity ought to haue extended as farre as mine, to the forgiuenesse of the whole debt of thy fellow seruant; we see then our duety, that in forgiuing the offences of our brethren, wee are to follow the example of the Lord, wee are fully and wholly to forgiue them, and to that purpose, know and consider we but this one thing, that if we forgiue not all to our bre∣thren, whensoeuer they haue offended vs, wee cannot then put vp that petition to the Lord, forgiue vs our debts, as we also forgiue our debtours with any comfort, let the lat∣ter part of that petition bee a promise of ours to the Law, or a Law binding all that looke for mercy from the Lord, to shew mercy, or a note of assurance, we cannot vse it with comfort, we therein fearefully pray against our selues, for
we reseruing a peece of our malice against our brethren: in that petition we beseech the Lord to reserue also a part of his wrath against vs, forgiuing vs but as wee forgiue o∣thers, and that being well considered, is able to make any heart seasoned with grace, to tremble to thinke vpon it, that we should so fearfully open our mouths, yea, so bold∣ly with our owne tongues, call for wrath and vengeance from Almightie God, let vs (as wee ought) consider and thinke vpon it, and let it stirre vs vp fully and wholly to forgiue the offences of our brethren, let vs not remember in malice the least offence of our brethren, least the Lord remember in iudgement any of our sinnes, and so strike vs as he may iustly, both bodie and soule to the bottome of hell, where no remission nor redemption is to bee ho∣ped for. VER. 15. Who is the image of the inuisible God, the first borne of euery creature. The Apostle here beginnes his proofe, of the sufficien∣cy of the worke of redemption wrought by Christ, that he is a perfect and sufficient Redeemer of Gods chosen, his proofe is laid downe in three verses, the 15.16. and 17. he prooues it from the dignitie of his person, shewing that he is true and eternall God, and therefore a perfect Redeemer. And that Christ is true and eternall God, is first propounded by the Apostle, vers. 15. and then confirmed verse 16. and 17. In the 15 verse containing the generall proposition, are two things affirmed of Christ, first, that he is the image of the inuisible God; and secondly, the first borne of euery creature. Come wee to more strict exa∣mination of these things, and for the first, I will stand a while to open the sense and meaning of the words, and not to trouble you with any curious and vnnecessary spe∣culations, but to hold to the scope and drift of the Apostle which was to propound sound Doctrine of faith, and to
teach how with profit we are to conceiue of the person of Christ.Christ the image of God his father two waies. Know that Christ is the image of God his Father two waies. First, as he is the eternall Sonne, of the same substance with the Father: and so his most absolute and perfect essentiall image, for hauing the very same eternall essence and substance with the Father, he doth most per∣fectly represent him:Interpreta∣tion. Heb. 1.3. hence he is said to be the brightnes of his glorie, and the engrauen forme of his person. Se∣condly, as he is God manifested in the flesh, as the Apostle speakes,1. Tim. 3.16. because God being inuisible doth manifest him∣selfe in Christ, in whom he hath made himselfe knowne to vs, to be most wise, iust, and mercifull; most wise, because in Christ he expressed towards vs, both perfect iustice and perfect mercy; and in Christ most iust, because in him he perfectly punished all our sinnes laid on him, as on our surety, and most mercifull also in Christ, because for his merit and satisfaction, he perfectly forgaue his chosen all their sinnes, and made them heires of his kingdome of glorie, thus is Christ the image of God. The next word to be expounded is (inuisible) for the clearing of that, consider we thus much. That seeing is of two sorts, either with the outward eie of the bodie, or with the eie of the minde. Concerning the outward sight, whereby curious and ig∣norant people would be glad to see God, hardly thinking there is a God, because they see him not with their bodily eies, the truth is, God cannot bee seene, because hee is a Spirit most simple and pure, and not subiect to the out∣ward sense, therefore he saith to Moses, Thou canst not see my face,Exod. 33.20. for there shall no man see me and liue. And the A∣postle,1. Tim 6.16. God dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man saw, neither can see; touching sight by the eie of the minde, wee must distinguish our estate heere in this life, from that it shall bee in the life to come, and know that by the minde whilest we are heere, wee are not able to see God as he is in himselfe, because all our know∣ledge heere, is by some outward formes or fashions, which
we conceiue in our minde and vnderstanding, and though we finde it said, that the Lord spake to Moses face to face;Exod. 33.11. we are to know that those words note onely a more fami∣liar and gracious manner of speaking, not that he saw God in substance and essence as hee is, and in the life to come, as many as goe to heauen shall see God in a most excellent manner, and with such comfort as no heart can compre∣hend, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God;Matth. 5.8. yet not simply as he is in his owne nature, because hee is infi∣nite, and we shall be still finite, though changed from cor∣ruption. Thus we haue it made plaine, how God is inui∣sible, because no way can he be seene, as he is in his owne nature, of any creature, either with the eye of the body, or with the eye of the minde, in this life or in the life to come. It is onely the Sonne of God that hath that sight of God his Father, for he is in the bosome of his Father: and the sight that man or Angell, hath of God in heauen; is, by a mediate person, the Sonne of God. So then the mea∣ning of the Apostle in these words is briefly this; who is the eternall Sonne of God, of the same substance with his Father, and in whom being incarnate; God who is inuisi∣ble, not to be seene either with the eye of the body, or with the eye of the minde in this life, or in the life to come, in his owne nature immediately hath made himselfe known to vs to be most wise, iust and mercifull. Now to the doctrine hence to be gathered: First we are  to marke that the Apostle doth fetch his proofe of the suf∣ficiency of our redemption from the Godhead of Christ,The God∣head of Christ is the first ground of our redemption. that he is the essentiall image of God his father, and there∣fore a sufficient and perfect Redeemer, that is the Apo∣stles reason; Whence wee may conclude, that is the God∣head of Christ is the first ground of our redemption, it is not grounded first vpon the manhood of Christ, but vpon Iesus Christ, God equall with the Father in Maiesty and glory. Yet we must remember that hee is our Mediatour, in respect of both nature diuine and humane, I will not
enlarge the point hauing said somthing of it before. But for the vse  in a word, it being so that the first ground of our redemption is the God-head of Christ,Our redemp∣tion by the bloud of Christ stands firme and fast for euer. it must needs follow, that his bloud is a most pretious bloud, and our redemption made by that bloud must of necessity hold, and stand firme and fast for euer, all the power of hel shall neuer be able to ouerturne it, if once we truly beleeue in Christ, we can neuer be vtterly cast away. Vpon this ve∣ry ground, that he and his Father are one, doth our Saui∣our inferre,Iohn. 10.28. that his sheepe shall neuer perish; and keepe this for a sure ground, when thou art tempted about thy redemption, and the certainty of it. We are further heere to marke, that the Apostle proouing Christ a perfect Re∣deemer, by an argument from his God head, saith not in one word that he is God, but he deliuers it in these termes, that he is the image of the inuisible God, a true and liuely representation of God: setting out vnto vs his infinite wis∣dome, iustice and mercy. The point of instruction hence following, is this; that true and sauing knowledge of Christ,True and sa∣uing know∣ledge of Christ, is ne∣uer seuered from true knowledge of Gods infinite wisedome, iu∣stice & mercy. can neuer be seuered from the true knowledge of the infinite wisdome, iustice and mercy of God; they that truly know Christ, and by the eye of a true faith looke vpon him, do in him, and by him see and behold, know and acknowledge the infinite wisedome, iustice and mercy of God; as when wee looke on the true patterne and expresse image of any thing, wee come to know the shape and forme of the first type, the thing resembled, so looking and truely beholding Christ, the true image of God, we cannot but know the wisdome, iustice and mercy of God his Father, reuealed and appea∣ring in him. It is the speech of Christ himselfe, Ioh. 14.7. If ye had knowne me, ye should haue knowne my Father also▪ and when Philip said vnto him, Lord, shew vs thy Father, and it sufficeth, our Sauiour checked him verse the ninth, Haue I beene so long time with you, and hast thou not knowen me Philip? he that hath seene me, hath seene my Father. How
then sayest thou, shew vs thy Father? To this agrees that of the Apostle,2. Cor. 4.4. that Christ which is the image of God should not shine vnto them, then vers. 6. that we haue the knowledge of the gory of God, in the face of Iesus Christ; come we to apply this; is it so, that they who truly know Christ, doe in him, and by him as in a cleere glasse, see be∣hold and know the wisedome, iustice and mercy of God; then let this be to vs a ground of examination. Let vs euery one from hence learne to reason backe a∣gaine on this manner if we truely know not the wisdome,  iustice and mercy of God, not by literall,Triall and ex∣amination of our selues. but by spirituall knowledge, euen by speciall distinct and working know∣ledge, then wee know not Christ by any true and sauing knowledge, for they that truely know Christ, know with him and by him, the wisedome, iustice and mercy of God. If many men and women were examined touching this point, though they professe Christ and Christian religion yet they would be found to know God no more then the very Heathen, who neuer heard of Christ. I dare bee bold to say, many there bee that haue onely a naturall know∣ledge of God, which all men haue by the light of nature, or such as is gathered by the sight of the creatures; and that no man may except against my speech, and say this is hard that we should so bee taxed, wee liue in a Church, where the knowledge of God is plainely taught, wee heare it sounding in our eares, and we cannot be so ignorant, let them therefore heare how I prooue it from the mouth of the Apostle, Hee saith of them,1. Cor. 15.34. that said let vs eate and drinke, for to morrow wee shall die. Awake to liue righteously, for some haue not the knowledge of God. The proposition is laid downe by the Apostle, and it is this, they that giue themselues to eating and drinking and sensuality, and liue securely in their sinnes, haue not the knowledge of God, now the assumption may be made by too many in the world, and then the conclusion must
needs follow vpon the premises, that they haue no know∣ledge of God it they will haue it further proued; then hear the Lords owne Argument, he saith, verse the 1. he had a controuersie, he was to enter an action against his people for want of knowledge,Hos. 4.2. and how doth he prooue it? thus verse 2. by swearing and lying, killing and stealing, and whoring they breake out, and bloud touched bloud. To go no further then the very first thing, is swearing an argu∣ment of the want of knowledge of God? (it must needs be so, God hauing manifested himselfe most plainely a iust auenger of that sinne) then many there bee that can tell themselues, if they wil not palpably flatter themselues that they are such as know not God, their speeches are more powdred with oathes, then their meat with salt, yea their children may witnes against them, whose tongues are no sooner taught to speake plainly, but they learne to sweare most wickedly: a man may heare it from them playing in the streets, and so may truly iudge of the parents that they haue no true knowledge of God themselues, neither care they to teach others vnder them either by word or exam∣ple to know the Lord. It is then plainely prooued against many, that will they, nill they, of force they must confesse they haue no true knowledge of God, then let such as bee conuinced consider that which was before deliuered, that they know not Christ by any sauing knowledge, but as the deuills know him, and let them marke the sequel, and that which followes vpon this, that they not knowing Christ, Christ will not know them, when he comes to diuide be∣tweene the sheepe & the goates, he will not then acknow∣ledge them for his, but say depart from me ye workers of ini∣quity I know you not. Which is a heauy sentence and to be thought on with trembling, and let it stir vs vp to labour for the true knowlege of God as he hath manifested him∣selfe in Christ, a God of infinite wisdome, iustice, and mer∣cy, not a God all of mercy and no iustice, that is to set vp an idoll of our owne braine, to thinke there is mercy with
God though we repent not, but go on in our sinnes. Let vs labour to know God as hee hath reuealed himselfe in Christ, his expresse image a God of infinite wisedome,Note. iu∣stice and mercy, that so we may assure our selues we truly know Christ, and are known of Christ, and shalbe acknow∣ledged to bee his at his comming, and to helpe vs yet for∣ward in this duty, let vs further consider that if the hea∣then were left without excuse by the sight of the creatures, then much more shal we by the sight of Christ the expresse image of God, if we know not God as we ought, if we haue greater light and meanes to know God by the com∣ming of Christ in the flesh then they, what a shame is it to haue lesse knowledge of God then they, if wee in Christ see not Gods infinite wisdome and mercy, wee are most blinde, we are euen fooles besotted and bewitched by the Deuill, they are the words of the Apostle.Gal. 3.1. O foolish Ga∣lathians who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth to whom Iesus Christ was before described in your sight and among you crucified. If Christ bee set be∣fore vs in liuely colours by the preaching of the word and the administration of the Sacramants and wee see not in him the infinite wisdome, iustice, and mercy of God wee are bewitched & deluded by the deuil, let this be thought on, and let it stirre vs vp to labour to know the infinite iustice and mercy of God expressed in the face of Iesus Christ. We are further to marke the Epithite the Apostle heere giues to God (inuisible) hee saith not the image of God omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, though these things might haue beene truely affirmed of God, but the image of the inuisible God, whereby (no doubt) he would  haue vs to vnderstand that the same God who is almighty filling heauen and earth, euen he is inuisible,We must ac∣knowledge God to be e∣uerie where present, thogh we see him not. the same God who is euery where present, yet is not to be seene, our les∣son arising hence is this, we are to acknowledge God to be euery where present, though inuisible, and though we see him not, for God who fils both heauen and earth is inuisi∣ble
and cannot be seene, if he could be seene, then must he be a body,Psalm. 145.3. and if so, then to be deuided into parts and included in a place, and so not infinite contrary to that. Great is the Lord, his greatnes incomprehnsible, not to be shut vp within the compasse of any place, we are therefore to know and acknowledge that God is euery where pre∣sent, though not seene of vs. We find this point expressed in most excellent termes by Dauid,Psalm. 139. where there is not a word escapes him, that God was seene of him, Dauid knew it well that he is a spirit inuisible but yet he sets it out in most excelent manner that God wa euery where present with him, that he was with him a is downe sitting, and at his vpriing, about his bed, and about his pathes, not a word in his tongue but he knew it, let him mooue either vpward or downeward, to the right hand or to the left, with neuer so great speed, euen as speedily as the Sunne beames, from the East to the West, yet hee could not flee from the presence of the Lord, nor hide himselfe vnder any couert or darknes from the al-seeing eie of God: thus it was with Dauid, and we are to learne it by his example, thus it ought to be with vs, we are to acknowledge God, though inuisible and not seene of vs, yet euery where pre∣sent. And if wee would further be resolued of this point, for the ground of it, consider we but that which experience may teach vs, namely this, men many times who sinne in secret, and haue no eie of man looking on them, yet not∣withstanding they tremble and feare. Whence comes this? Surely their owne conscience tels them that their close and secret sinnes are seene of God though he be not seene of them, yea when the conscience doth faile in this testimony, (as many times it doth, beeing hardned by custome of sinne) then the very dumbe and senselesse creatures are sometimes made remembrancers and accu∣sers of men for their sinnes, as the Lord threarneth by his Prophet. Stories are full of examples of this kind, yea, no doubt,Habac. 2.1. many of vs may remember that wee haue either
knowne or heard of some who haue bene brought to con∣fesse their seeret sinnes by the sight of the fouls of the aire, yea sometimes such diseases haue beene sent vpon men, as haue made their owne mouthes to publish and bewray their secret sinne. What are these things but euen plaine e∣uidences and demonstrations that though God be inuisi∣ble, yet he is euery where present, and sees things done in the most secret places of the world, and when it pleaseth him, and by what meanes it likes him best doth hee bring them to light. Wee are then to acknowledge it for a truth, though God be inuisible, yet he is euery where present. To inforce this yet further because indeed that is chief∣ly to be intended, and driuen at in this point,  that we may labour to haue in our hearts a setled acknowledgement of it. Consider first it is one speciall meanes to worke in vs inward soundnes and truth of heart, nothing is more effe∣ctuall to keepe vs from hypocrisie,Our harts are to be setled in the truth of doctrine be∣fore deliuered it will bee a meanes to keepe vs, first from hypo∣crisie. and many other grosse sinnes then this, what seruant so lewd that will not yeelde to his master eye seruice at the least: In like sort when wee know and acknowledge Gods presence, and that his eye looketh on vs, that hee is a beholder, a witnesse and iudge of all our actions, and if we sin, wee lye open to his iudge∣ments,Secondly frō sinning vpon supposed se∣cresie. who is it but one giuen ouer to sinne and to the power of hell that will not feare to offend, the vndoubted perswasion of Gods presence will set a barre before our corruption and keepe it in: againe it takes from our cor∣ruption, and from Satans alluring vs to sinne, that aduan∣tage which many times is imagined, that is secrecy that wee may sinne because wee are in secret, it is a corruption bred and borne with vs to seek corners, with vs to commit sinne, shifts and excuses to hide it: the eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twi-light, and saith no eye shall mee, and gisguiseth his face. Vpon this the Deuill takes aduantage, and by it preuailes so farre with some, that hee doth vtterly blot out of their mindes the remembrance of Gos pre∣sence,
and makes them presume to sinne with boldnesse, because (as they imagine) they are in secret, that God, he is aboue, and the clouds they hide him that he cannot see, and he walketh in the circuit of heauen. Now this corrup∣tion of ours,Iob. 22.14. and this subtilty of Satan are crossed, and that liberty that some giue themselues to sinne is taken a∣way, by a setled perswasion of this, that God though he be inuisible, yet he is euery where present, as many as truely acknowledge God euery where present, they cannot bee emboldened to sin, the Deuill cannot preuaile with them to sinne, because they are in secret and want witnesses, for they know God sees them, and there is no creature which is not manifest in his sight, let vs then labor to haue in our hearts a full perswasion of this, that God though he be in∣uisible, yet he is euery where present, and we shall finde it effectuall to worke in vs inward soundnesse of heart, and a notable meanes to defeat the subtilty and cunning of the Deuil, that he shal not be able to circumuent vs, as he doth many thousands in the world, perswading with them that they are in secret, and therefore they may sinne, wee shall be able to beat backe this assault, and to tell him though wee see not God, yet God doth see vs, and all wee thinke, speake or doe, which is more then if all the men in the world should see vs, for hee can kill soule as well as body, and cast both soule and bodie into hell fire. Come we to the second thing affirmed of Christ in this verse, that hee is the first borne of euerie creature, and for the vnderstanding of the words, wee must know that the Apostle calls Christ the first borne, by way of resemblance and allusion to the first borne in the olde testament. Now Christ is so called in a double respect,Interpreta∣tion. first, because as the first borne were brought forth before the rest of their bre∣thren, so Christ as God was begotten of the substance of his Father before any creature was made, or had being, he was begotten from al eternity after an vnspeakeable man∣ner,Iohn 1.1. before the world was. In the beginning was the word, and
the word was with God, and the word was God. When things created beganne to be, then he was, and so before all crea∣tures euen from eternitie, for time beganne together with the world, and before the creation was eternitie. Secondly, because as the first borne sonne among the people of Israel, succeeded his Father in the Kingdome, and Priesthood, and was Lord and Gouernour of his bre∣thren, so Christ was made heire of the world,Heb. 1.2. and chiefe gouernour of Gods family, his children elected and adop∣ted in him; now heere we are to vnderstand the words of the Apostle, in the first respect not in the second, because the purpose of the Apostle was here, to set out vnto vs, the eternity of Christ his God-head and not to speake of him as God and man, for in that respect, namely, in respect of his manhood assumed vnto vnity of person with his God∣head, he is resembled to the first borne, as he hath relati∣on to his Church,Rom. 8 29. therefore called the first borne among many brethren. So then the words are thus to be concei∣ued, who was begotten of God his Father from all eterni∣ty, before any creature was made, or had being. Let vs now come to the doctrine offered from these  words. First, we are to marke,The eternall generation of Christ is vn∣speakeable. that the Apostle speaking of the eternitie of Christ, he sets it not downe simply, that he was from all eternitie, but in a comparison, that hee is the first borne of euery creature: whence we are taught, that the eternall generation of Christ is vnspeakeable, as he is God begotten of his Father from all eternitie, we are not able to comprehend it,Reuel. 19.12 Isai. 53.8. but by way of shadow or resem∣blance: hee is said to haue a name written, that no man knowes but himselfe, and the Prophet saith, who shall de∣clare his age. Let vs not then curiously search into it,We are not curiously to search into Christ his e∣ternall gene∣ration. nor into any of Gods mysteries, further then the holy Ghost in the Word goes before vs, and take for a truth, they that know God, and his secrets reuealed in his Word, are thus affected; they modestly and humbly come to the hearing of the
Word, and with trembling heart; and the more the Lord openeth himself and his mysteries to them, the more they finde and feele their owne wants and weakenesse to be∣hold such glorie, and none come more boldly, and with lesse reuerence and preparation, then they that know no∣thing. Come we to another thing offered vnto vs from this re∣semblance, full of sweete comfort to all that belong to  Christ, namely this, Christ the eternall sonne of God, saith the Apostle,Christ is most deare & ten∣derlie beloued of God his Father. is as the first borne, then any may easily ga∣ther it, that he is most deare and tenderly beloued of God his Father; euen so deare, as the first borne sonne is com∣monly to an earthly Father, nay, there is no comparison betweene them, but onely for our capacity, it may thus be deliuerd, his loue exceedeth the loue of the most kind Father in the world, as farre as God excels dust, earth, sin, and corruption; to stand to prooue this, were as much as to go about to adde light to the Sunne: Let vs rather con∣sider the comfort of it, we know what affection euery one commonly beares to the fruit of his own body, to his first borne,  he cannot endure to looke vpon the abuse of any part of it,Comfort to the members of Christ. it would go to the heart of a tender father, to see a legge or an arme of their first borne cut off by the hand of a bloudy butcher; let this lead vs to the consideration (as we are able to conceiue it) of the Lords tender loue & affection to the members of Christ, his first borne, and teach vs that hee much lesse can endure the wrongs done to any member of his Sonne, cruelties exercised on them, pierce his gracious bowels, the Lord may, and doth suffer many afflictions to be laid on the members of Christ, for their good best knowne to himselfe, as an earthly father perceiuing cause of further good, doth sometimes suffer his chide to lie in prison, to be in want, to bite on the bri∣dle for a time, and as the saying is, he may see him neede, but he cannot endure to see him bleed; so our gracious God in his wisdome, for much good knowne to himselfe
may see the members of his son humbled; schooled and wayned from the loue of this wretched world, but vndone, & vtterly cast away, he cannot endure it, he will not suffer it, no, he will not see it, let this be had in remembrance, as a sweet comfort to all Gods Children in their greatest afflictions. VER. 16. For by him were all things created, which are in  Heauen, and which are in earth, things visible and inuisi∣ble: whether they be Thrones or Dominions, Principali∣ties or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him. The Apostle in this verse prooues his generall proposi∣tion layd downe ver. the 15. That Christ is the true eter∣nall God, begotten of his Father from all eternity, this he prooueth by two arguments. First, because Christ is the creatour of all things. Secondly, because all things were created and made for his glory. The first argument is laid downe in the first words, for by him were all things made, and that is resumed and repeated in the latter end of the verse: in which argument, is speciall relation to the words of the former verse, that he is the first borne of euery creature. For if all things were created by him, then it must needs fol∣low, that he was before all things, and that he was not crea∣ted as Arrian Heretickes hold, but begotten of his Father from euerlasting. Now this argument is further layd a∣broad, by a double difference of things created, the Apo∣postle was not content to say in generall, that by Christ all things were created, but hee doth further particularize, and vnfold what he meanes by all things. First, by a diffe∣rence of place, wherein things created are, heauen and earth; which are in heauen and which are in earth, then by difference of their quality, visible and inuisible, after this, followeth another amplification by speciall instance, the Apostle insisting in one sort of inuisible creatures, namely
Angels, which he calles by these titles of honour and dig∣nity, Thrones or Dominions, Principalities or Powers; he hath made all inuisible creatures, euen the most excellent inui∣sible creatures, the Angels, whether ye call them thrones &c. and then repeats the generall, all things were created by him; and thus farre goeth the first argument. The se∣cond is in the very last words (and for him) and these bee the parts of this verse. Come we to speake of the words, as they are layd downe by the holy Ghost, and first of the words (for by him were all things created) whereas the A∣postle sayth (by him) namely, by Christ: though that phrase and forme of speech applied to any worke,Interpreta∣tion. do com∣monly signifie the meanes, or instrument of working; yet heere we are not so to conceiue it, as that Christ was an vn∣der instrument, or inferiour meanes of creating as the Ar∣rian Heretickes wickedly would haue concluded, but that by his substantiall power, and vertue equall to the power of God his Father, all things were created, Whatsoeuer the Father doth,Ioh. 5.19. the same things doth the Sonne also. And againe, we are not to vnderstand these words (by him) as spoken exclusiuely, as shutting out God the Father and holy Ghost, for that is contrary to the first Article of our Creed, that God the Father is the Creatour of all things, and wee are to remember the rule, that Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indiuisa, and therefore the worke of creation, is a worke of the whole Trinity; but we are to conceiue of this, and of that in the first Article, as set downe onely to shew the or∣der and manner of the creation, that God the Fathers, as he is the fountaine of the God-head, not temporall but ori∣ginall, so as the first authour, he created all things by God the Sonne, as Ioh. 1.3. All things were made by it, that is, by the Sonne, the substantiall Word of the Father, (crea∣ted) that is, which were not before, formed and made to be, and that of nothing, thus then are these words to bee conceiued: For by his substantiall power, equall to the power of God his Father, working together with the Fa∣ther
and the holy Ghost, were all things that were not be∣fore, framed and made and that of nothing. Now to the doctrine, first we are to marke the argument of the Apostle, that he prooues Christ to be true and eter∣nall God, by an argument from the creation, that he crea∣ted all things, and therefore he is God eternall, whence it followeth directly and plainely, that the worke of creati∣on, doth manifestly euince and prooue the God-head, he  is God that creates; and backe againe,The worke of creation is a plaine proofe of the God∣head. hee that is able to create is God; for it is a property peculiar to the God∣head incommunicable to create, it cannot bee giuen nor agree to any creature, Saint or Angell; no not to all the Saints and Angels, for that were to make them omnipo∣tent to giue being to any thing, that was nothing before, is proper to God. It is the Lords own argument to proue himselfe God, he sayth verse 6. I am the Lord,Isay 45 7. and there is none other. How prooues he that verse 7. I forme the light and create darknesse: I make peace and create euill: I the Lord doe all these things. And Ier. 10.11. he brings it as an ar∣gument against idols and false gods, to prooue them no gods, but meere vanities as he calles them, and subiect to destruction: thus (sayth he) shall you say vnto them, the gods that haue not made the heauens and the earth, shall perish from the earth, and from vnder the heauens, and verse the 12. by way of opposition, hee hath made the earth, and established the world by his wisedome, and hath stretched out the heauens by his descretion. The point is cleere, and for vse of it, first it serues to dis∣couer  couer the errour of the Maniches,Confutation of the Mani∣ches. such as held there were two authors, & two beginnings of things created, of good & profitable God; of euill & hurtfull, the Diuell; we are to auoyd this as erroneous and false, and know that all things were created by God. God made all things good,Ob. how then came materiall e∣uill things, (not to speake of naturall euill, as death and diseases, or morall euill, sinne) how came scorpions, vene∣mous
serpents to bee euill and hurtfull, will you say that God made them so? No, God made all things good indeed, they were good by creation. God looked on all that he had made, and saw it was good, but they became hurtfull accidentally by sin, if man had not sinned, no creature had beene hurtfull vnto him,Gen. 3.17. but vpon the fall, the Lord sayd, cursed is the earth for thy sake, in sorrow shalt thou eat of it, all the dayes of thy life. Againe, we are to consider, that the most poysonfull thing in the world, is good for something, though we know not the vse of it, experience teacheth that one poyson is driuen out by another,Psal. 104.24. therefore we are to say with the Psalmist, O Lord how manifold are thy workes, in wisedome, hast thou made them all; the earth is full of thy riches. Againe, is it so, that he is God that createth, and he that is able to create is God,Wee are to take heed of Satans slight in imitating the worke of creation. then let this teach vs, to take heed of a cunning subtilty and sleight, of the Deuill, who as in many other things, so in this, in the work of creation of ma∣king things of nothing, would seeme to imitate God, and would be like God, as by iuglers, inchanters, and such like his instruments, he would seeme to make that to be which is not, and so doth winne to himselfe from simple people that runne after men of that cursed crue, from such I say as are simple and in the Lords iust iudgement, giuen ouer to themselues, an opinion of great power, we are to take heed of this subtilty, and knowe that the Deuill cannot make the least creature in the world, he by Gods permission, and for our triall may delude the outward sences, and make things appeare to be which are not as Iannes and Iambres did, they turned their roddes into serpents, and brought frogges &c. and the witch of Endor who made counter∣set Samuel to rise out of the earth,Exod. 7.8. but he cannot make any true reall and substantiall creature,1. Sam. 28.14. or change a creature of one kinde into another, when it pleaseth God to restraine him, he is not able to make a counterfet lowse, a base cre∣ture as we read of the Aegyptian inchanters,Exod. 8.18. they assayed
likewise with their inchantments to bring foorth lice, but they could not. Let vs not then be carried away with any conceit, that the Deuill can by a iugler or inchanter make any true creature. And because many there be that are too forward to giue heed to iuglers, & such deceiuers, I would entreat them but to consider the danger of giuing heed to such persons, and let them know that by such meanes the Deuill doth encroach and gather ground vpon them, and in time doth get so farre within them, as that he doth seat and settle himselfe vpon their thoughts, he makes them to magnifie him in their conceit, yea, to deifie him in his in∣struments, and to ascribe vnto him that which is proper to God, euen the power of creating things of nothing, which is a most grosse and abominable idolatrie, in our thoughts to set vp and magnifie the Deuill in stead of God, what can be more grosse? It was the sinne of the heathen. But they will say this is my surmise and my imagina∣tion.Ob. I answer them,  I am able to warrant it from the word of God, Act. 8.9. we finde that Simon the sorcerer vsed witch∣craft and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying, that he himselfe was some great man. Marke what followed vers. 10. they gaue heed vnto him, from the least to the greatest: and what was the issue of that? the Deuill in time brought them to this, euen to ascribe vnto himselfe in Simon his in∣strument the power of God: they said this man is the great power of God. Let vs therefore learne, that the Deuill is not able to make the least creature, and so be admonished not to runne after iuglers, giuing heed vnto them, lest the Deuill get within vs, euen so farre, as to make vs set vp him in our thoughts in stead of the true God, which is the most vile and grosse kinde of idolatrie that can be, and cannot chuse but be the immediate fore-runner of Gods heauie wrath and iudgements. In the next place we are to consi∣der the generalitie of the Apostles words, that all things were created by Christ: the worke of creation wrought by
Christ, as God, is a generall worke, it is common to vs, with all things that haue a being in the world, though there be a difference betweene vs, and other creatures vnder vs, in qualitie and condition in respect of reason, yet they are the creatures of Christ as he is God, as well as we. What is  then our lesson hence? Euen this: Wee are not to content our selues only to know that we are the creatures of Christ as he is God,Wee must know Christ, not only to be our Crea∣tor, but also to be our Redee∣mer and San∣ctifier. that our bodies and soules, and the members and faculties of them, are the worke of his hands, and that he is our Creator; for that is a common benefit, extended to bruit beasts as well as to vs; they haue Christ, as hee is God, their Creator as well as we: wee are therefore neuer to rest, till we know that he is our Redeemer & Sanctifier, and that by him wee are created anew, and by him made new creatures,2. Cor. 5 17. Gal. 6.15. as the Apostle speakes, If any be in Christ, let him be a new creature: and he saith, that in Christ Iesus nei∣ther circumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but a new creature;What a new creature is. and in a word to tell you what it is to be a new creature, it is this, to haue the minde, will, and af∣fections, and all the powers of the soule renued, not in sub∣stance, but in holinesse and righteousnesse, and that in truth, according to the image of God, in which wee were first created. To perswade to this, consider wee that God hauing gi∣uen vs reason,Motiues to stir vs vp to be created anew by Christ. vnderstanding, and abilitie, aboue many o∣ther creatures, wee are to vse them, not onely to consider the workes of creation, and by them to see the power, wis∣dome and goodnesse of God, but to haue them sanctified by the word and spirit, in faith and loue, to serue the Lord, or else we haue no more comfort, by our reason and vn∣derstanding, than bruit beasts by their sense and vegetati∣on.Psal. 119 7. This Dauid knew well, and therefore said, Thy hands haue made me and fashioned me; and he doth not there rest, as contenting himselfe to be the creature of God, but ads further, giue mee knowledge that I may learne thy com∣mandements, or else I haue no more comfort by this, than
the bruit beasts haue by their sense. Againe, if wee rest in our creation that we are the crea∣tures  of Christ, we are no neerer heauen than the oxe or  asse, for they all are the creatures of Christ. Ioine to this, that we are in farre worse case than the very toad or vene∣mous serpent, if wee content our selues in being the crea∣tures of Christ: for their death is to them as an end of mi∣serie, but ours is then a beginning of endlesse woe, without ease or remedie. If then wee would haue true comfort in our excellencie aboue other creatures in our reason, vn∣derstanding, and will, if we would be preferred before the bruit beasts in our title to the kingdome of heauen, and not be in worse case than the vilest creatures at our death, let vs not rest in this, that wee are the creatures of Christ, but labour to be made by him and in him new creatures, to be renued according to the image of God in true holi∣nesse and righteousnesse, that so we may haue true com∣fort both in life and death. Come we now to the first difference of things created in respect of place, in these words, which are in heauen: and that wee proceed according to the true meaning of the Apostle, ranging all things created into one of these two places, heauen and earth, we must know first that the word heauen in proper signification is taken in Scripture three waies,Interpreta∣tion. sometimes to signifie all that aeriall or elementarie region which is aboue the globe of the earth and waters, to the lowest part or circle of heauen, wherein the Moone is placed. Thus it is taken, Behold the fowles of heauen.Mat. 6.26. So also, Hypocrites, ye can discerne ,Luk. 12.56. by the brightnesse or cloudinesse of the aire, yee can discerne the weather. I will heare the heauens,Hosea 2.21. and they shall heare the earth. Secondly, it is taken for all the celestiall orbes, wherein the planets, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest of the fix∣ed starres are placed thus.Gen. 15.5. Looke vp now vnto the Hea∣uens, and tell the starres if thou be able to number them,
saith God to Abraham: and hence the starres are called the army or host of heauen.Ierem. 33.22. Thirdly, it is taken for the seat of the blessed Angels & Saints, whether Christ is ascended, and from whence hee shall come to iudgement, thus it is taken where the A∣postle saith he was taken vp into the third heauen.2. Cor. 12.2. Now heere it is taken generally for the aire, the starrie skie, and the seat of the blessed Angells and Saints: and by the earth wee are to vnderstand the whole globe of the earth and waters, and as well the inward bowells of the earth as the outward superficies of it. Where there∣fore the Apostle saith which are in heauen, and which are in the earth, it is as if he had thus said, which are in the aire, in the starrie skie, and in the seat of the blessed An∣gells and Saints, and which are vpon the face and inward parts of the earth. Come we now to such things as may be obserued from hence: first we are to marke that the Apostle hauing set it downe in generall, that by Christ all things were created, and that the worke of creation wrought by Christ as God is a generall worke, he doth not there make a stop, but hee doth further amplifie this generall by the speciall diffe∣rences of things, that some things created are in heauen, and some in earth, some visible and some inuisible, whence we may conclude, that though the worke of creation bee great and generall, yet, it is not confused, but it pleased  God the creator to set things created in good order, and to range them into seuerall places,The worke of creation is great and ge∣nerall, yet not confused. and seuerall conditions, for as the Apostle saith, God is the author of peace and or∣der, and not of confusion and deformity, confusion and such like were neuer made by God, but crept in by Sa∣thans malice, and mans corruption, and vpon the fall came into the world as breaches and blots of Gods order set a∣mong creatures:1. Cor. 14.33. now wherefore did the Lord (for that is chieflie to be knowne) dispose things created into seuerall places and conditions? Surely that there might not onely
be a comely proportion and correspondency of one crea∣ture with another among themselues; but that all might serue distinctly in their seuerall places and order, for the vse and good of man: for as the Lord himselfe saith, hee prepared the earth, he created it not in vaine,Isay 45.18. hee formed it to bee inhabited, I am the Lord, and there is no other. God said,Gen 1.14. let there bee lights in the firmament of heauen to separate the day from the night, and let them bee for signes, and for seasons, and for daies and yeares. After the flood: heereafter seed time, and haruest, and cold,Gen. 8.22. and heat, and summer, and winter, and day, and night, shall not cease so long as the earth remaineth: the considerati∣on whereof should not only leade vs to see and behold the infinite wisedome of God in making so excellent a frame as the world is,  and disposing things of such varietie and difference to so good vse and purpose:The worke of creation shewes the in∣finite wise∣dome of God, and the con∣sideration of it may streng∣then our de∣pendance on Gods proui∣dence at all times. but withall it may serue to strengthen our dependance at all times vpon the prouidence of God. For why? (consider it seriously) did the Lord before any of vs breathed in the world so distin∣guish and designe his creatures in such comely order, that nothing should be superfluous or wanting, but all iointly and euery one seuerally should serue for our vse, and will he now we are brought into the world forsake vs? Cer∣tainly no; if wee haue hearts to rest on his prouidence, he will neuer faile nor forsake vs, we haue the Lords owne word for it,Heb. 13.5. that in quietnesse and content wee should rest on his prouidence, for hee hath said, I will not faile thee, neither forsake thee; and it is worthie obseruation that we finde Gen. 1. that the Lord created the first man vpon the earth, he made all things ready for his vse, as a man that is to entertaine his friend whom he loues, hee prouideth all things both for necessitie and pleasure, so did the Lord for man, he made the earth for him to goe vpon, the heauens to couer and giue light vnto him, fishes, fowles, beasts, herbes, and fruits to feed and comfort him, and hee put beautie, sweetnesse, colour, brightnes, and many other ex∣cellent
qualities vpon his creatures, to make them pleasant and delightsome vnto him: did the Lord this for our first parents, and is he any changeling? no, no, with him there is no shadow of change: hee prouided for Adam, and hee will prouide for vs, if we be in Christ. Let vs consider our owne comming into the world, wherein all things were ready prouided and set in order before we came, we were prouided of parents, friends, and many speciall comforts needfull; yea let vs but looke vpon our own composition and making, that we haue bodies furnished with members for euery good vse, soule endued with many excellent fa∣culties, and learne by such testimonies of Gods loue to de∣pend on his prouidence. In the next place we are to marke, that the Apostle saith  the same hand of Christ, as he is God, made the goodly & glorious creatures in heauen,Christ as he is God, could haue made the meanest creature the most glori∣ous. and things of lesse glory and beautie, euen things creeping on the face of the earth: whence it is easie to be gathered, that if it had pleased God, he could haue made the meanest creature the most glorious, euen a stone vpon the ground a starre in the skie, and a worme an Angell: for what was the cause that the creature was made a stone, and not a starre? euen the good pleasure of the Lord, nothing else, no other reason can be rendred:Psal. 135.6. the Lord is great aboue all Gods, and hath done whatsoeuer he would in heauen,Rom. 9.20. and in earth, in the Sea, and in all the depths: though the words be spoken by way of similitude in the case of predestination, to illustrate and make it plaine, that we ought not to aske a reason of it, but to rest in the will and pleasure of the Lord; yet take them as a proper simple speech & standing by themselues, and then they serue to silence the creature, that it ought not to demand a reason why it was made of this order or fashion, but to rest in the good pleasure of the creator: shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? as if he had said, it were too great boldnesse for the creature so to reason with the Creator; let it rest in
his will and pleasure. The ground of this truth is, because the actuall power of God is equall to his will,Note. his absolute power reacheth beyond his will, he by his absolute power can make of stones bread, or children to Abraham, but his actuall power reacheth no further then his will. Is it so that Christ if so it had pleased him, could haue  made of the meanest creature the most glorious?We are not to depraue or a∣buse the mea∣nest creature then we are to esteeme of the meanest things in the world, and not to depraue and abuse them, as wee doe many waies, but most wickedly when we sweare by them, for then as much as lieth in vs, we aduance them to the throne of God. It is our Sauiours argument,Mat. 5.36. that wee must not sweare by our heads, because they are his creatures, and not ours, wee are not able to make one haire white or blacke. But I will not further stand on that: let vs by this be led forward to con∣sider that Christ, as he is God, is able to vse the meanest &  weakest things in the world to ouermaster the strongest,Christ as he is God can vse the meanest and weakest creatures to ouermaster the strongest. as he could in the first creation of all things haue made the meanest creature the most glorious, so doubtlesse hee can giue power at his pleasure to the weakest to match and o∣uercome the strongest. We finde in the book of Exod. that he dealt with hard hearted & rebellious Pharaoh by frogs and lice, and such like meane and contemptible creatures: it had beene as easie for the Lord, when he turned dust in∣to lice, to haue turned it into Lions, Beares, Wolues, and beasts of exceeding greatnesse and cruell fiercenesse; but hee rather chose to confound pride by weaknesse, that his power might more appeare, and to shew that hee is able at his pleasure to make the weakest creature to conquer and bring downe the pride and power of the strongest. And to presse this a little further, let vs thinke of it to this purpose: and if the Lord can make such meane creatures, as frogs, lice, & flies, too strong for a mightie kingdome, what resi∣stance then can any silly man or woman make against the Lords wrath, if they pull it vpon them by their sinnes? his wrath can arme all the creatures in heauen and earth a∣gainst
vs, and giue power to the least of them, to a flie, an haire, or the like, farre aboue any power of ours. Who then as the Prophet saith, Nahu. 1.6. can stand before his wrath, or who can abide the fiercenesse of his wrath? his wrath is powred out like fire, and the rockes are broken by him. Let hard hearted & impenitent sinners think vpon it, that the Lord Iesus Christ could (if it had pleased him) haue made a silly worme a glorious Angell, and hee can vse the meanest creature to bring downe the power of the stron∣gest, he can arme all creatures against vs. Let vs therefore learne to tremble before him: shall we prouoke him to an∣ger, and not bring confusion vpon our selues? he is a migh∣tie creator, therfore able to bring infinite punishments vp∣on vs at his pleasure. It is the exhortation of the Prophet, Amos 4.12 Prepare to meet thy God oh Israel, and hee builds his exhortation vpon this very ground, for loe hee that formeth the mountaines, and createth the windes, & declareth vnto man what his thought is, which maketh the morning darknesse, and walketh vpon the high pla∣ces of the earth, the Lord of hoasts is his name: as if he had said, God is able to create the windes, to forme the moun∣taines, to alter the course of nature, to make the morning darknesse, therefore he is able to make an eternall iudge∣ment for thy confusion; be therefore admonished to pre∣pare to meet this mightie God. For the conclusion of this point,Luk. 20.18. remember Christ his owne speech, that whosoeuer shall fall vpon him shall be broken, and on whomsoeuer he shall fall, he shall grinde him to powder. Now to the second difference of things created in respect of qualitie, things visible and inuisible, that is to say, things corporeall, bodily substances, subiect to sight and other outward senses: and incorporeall, such as consist not of a grosse,Interpreta∣tion. palpable, and visible matter, but haue a pure, subtil, and spirituall substance, as Angels and the soules of mē, which are creatures really subsisting, but not to be per∣ceiued by any outward sense, that is the meaning of the
Apostle, I might stand heere to shew that Angels are sub∣stances, and though they bee inuisible and and spirituall, yet they haue a reall being, and haue life motion and vn∣derstanding, but I hope none amongst vs are of the Saddu∣ces mind, who said there was neither resurrection,Acts. 23.1. neither Angell nor spirit. But that they were onely qualities or good motions of the minde. Or that thinke as the like times did, that Angels or spirits good or bad, were nothing but good and bad successe. I will therefore go no further then the naming of that point: and note wee from these words briefly this, that seeing the holy ghost made choice of this distinction of things created in respect of quality, that some are visible and some inuisible, wee are therefore to hold it as a true difference of things,It is a true dif∣ference of things, that some are visi∣ble and some inuisible. 1. Cor. 15.53. yea such a distincti∣on  as cannot be confounded, the parts of it cannot be con∣cident, they can neuer fall together: these qualities of things created visible and vnuisible, can neuer agree to the same subiect, not onely at the same time, but at seuerall times, though wee are taught that the bo∣dies of true beleeuers raised vp and glorified shall bee changed, corruption shall put on incorruption, and mor∣tall shall put on immortaliiy, yet neither there nor any where do we read, that visible shal put on inuisibility,  these shall be distinct qualities of things for euer, if any oppose vnto this that of our Sauiour Mat. 22.30. they shall bee as the Angells, and therefore inuisible.  That is not to keep within the compasse of the text, but to extend the wordes beyond the true meaning of them, from the speciall pur∣pose of Christ that place was not to make knowne the qua∣lities of the Saints raised vp and glorified, but their state and condicion of life, that it should not be with them as in this life, where they are married, and wiues are bestowed on them in marriage. If any further obiect that 1. Cor. 15.44.Ob. their bodies shal be spirituall, Againe, we are there to vnderstand (spirituall) opposed,
not to visible, but to naturall, that is pure and free from heauinesse of earthly matter, and not standing in neede of naturall meane of nourishment or sustentaeion by meates drinkes, sleepe and such like, they shall bee spirituall thus vnderstood, but yet visible as the body of Christ, and to this end I note this to shew how crosse the Papists are to this distinction made by the holy Ghost, they make the body of Christ a visible creature inuisible, and say it is the Sacrament really present, and yet not to be seene, againe they make visible formes of Angels which are spirituall substances and inuisible, and not to bee resembled by any outward formes, thus they confound things distinguished plainely by the holy Ghost. Come wee to the amplification of the Apostles argu∣ment by speciall instance.Confutation of the papists. The Apostle heere insisteth in one sort of inuisible creatures, thrones or dominions, prin∣cipalities or powers. Though euill Angells be sometimes thus called as Ephes. 6.12. yet that good Angels are heere meant by the Apostle it is agreed vpon by the best inter∣preters,Interpreta∣tion. ancient, and of latter times; & vpon good ground because so to vnderstand the wordes, is consonant to the scope of the Apostle in this Epistle, which was to shew that Christ is to be worshipped and not Angels, as the false Apostles taught, cap. 2. 18. the good Angels are called by these names, not as by titles of order and degree as the Pa∣pists affirme, who in this point of foolish curiosity in set∣ting downe the orders of Angels, haue gone so farre as they haue lost themselues, as in a maze, for though it can∣not be denied but that there is order among the Angels, order being a most excellent thing, yet that these be titles of order can neuer be proued. Auguste saith, what dif∣ference there is betweene these 4. words, Thrones, Domini∣ons, Principalities, Powers: let them tell vs that be able, so they prooue that they tell vs, for my part, (saith he) I con∣fesse I know it not, wee are not then to conceiue of these words as signifying seuerall orders and degrees of Angels,
but as set downe by way of similitude to signifie both the glory and office of the good Angel, by whom Christ doth execute, and performe many great and wonderfull works, as it were by Kings, Rulers, Princes and Potentates, for the Apostle doth set downe these titles of dignity and office, in the abstract, for the concrete meaning by Thrones, as it were Kings, Rulers, Princes or Potentates, thus then are we to conceiue the words of the Apostle, as if he had sayd, euen the good Angels were created by Christ, who are both most glorious creatures, and vsed by him to per∣forme many great and wonderfull workes, by what name soeuer ye call them, whether ye conceiue them vnder the name of Kings or Rulers. Princes or Potentates. Now, heere first we are to marke, that the Apostle spea∣king of the creation of Angels, hee sayth not in plaine termes, that inuisible things were created by Christ, euen Angels; but he vseth these borrowed speeches, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, hee sets them downe by way of similitude, comparing them to the highest digni∣ties and glories in the world, as Gouernours are called Iud.  Epist. ver. 8 And that in the abstract, whence it followeth,The good Angels are most excel∣lent creatures. that the good Angels are most excellent creatures, earthly Kings, Princes and Potentates in their greatest pompe, & glory of their Thrones, are but shadowes of the good An∣gels, and for further proofe of this, we shall finde that the Scriptures speake of them, as of the excellency of all crea∣tures, yea, when the greatest glory and praise belonging to any inferiour creature is spoken of in Scripture, the speech is then taken from the glory of Angels, a when the woman of Tekoah,2. Sam. 14.17. was to commend the wisedome and knowledge of Dauid, she saith, My Lord the King is euen as an Angell of God, in hearing of good and bad.Psal. 7 8.25. Thus Manna is called Angels food, that is most excellent food, that if Angels should need food, it were fitting for them. 1. Cor. 13.1. though I should speake (saith the Apostle) with the tongues of Men and Angels, his meaning is, if had the most
excellent and eloquent tongue that possibly could bee, thus then the greatest glory and excellency of any creature being set out by speech drawen from Angels, it must needs be that they are most excellent, yea, it is a part of Gods glory, to haue attendance of Angels, and it shall be a part of our glory after the resurrection to be like to them, ther∣fore they doubtlesse are most excellent creatures. Now, how may the consideration of the excellency of Angels perfect vs?The excellen¦cy of Angels must lead vs to see the glo∣ry of Christ their creeator and so in o∣ther things. Surely thus, we are thereby to be led on, to see the glory of Christ their Creatour, for if these creatures be so glorious, how glorious then is he that made them, wee are not to rest in the beauty and excellency of the creature, but to rise vp, and ascend by that, and from that, to the glory of the Creatour, and thus must we doe in all things of any excellency; when we see men excell in rare gifts, of beauty, strength, goodly proportion of bo∣dy, in wisedome, knowledge and such like, we are not to rest in these things, but by them must be brought to see the glory, power and infinite wisdome of the Creatour: yea, when wee finde knowledge and vnderstanding of good things in our selues, we are not to rest vpon them, but to be carried vp from our knowledge and vnderstanding to the giuer of them, for what hast thou, that thou hast not re∣ceiued from the Father of lights, which is a thing needfull to be vrged in these daies, wherein many men hauing good gifts, doe rest too much in their gifts of knowledge and vnderstanding, as appeares in the Brownists, Familists and others, for doubtlesse, one speciall cause of their conti∣nuance in their erroneous opinions,Note. is their too much re∣sting vpon their owne knowledge: whereby, in the iust iudgement of God, they fall into the snare of pride and high conceit of their vnderstanding and knowledge, and make to themselues an idoll of their owne vnderstanding, a thing very dangerous and hard to be cured, for hee that doth rest vpon his owne opinion, and though he erre, yet holds his errour for a certaine truth, by whom can he bee
cured? how will hee submit himselfe to any mans iudge∣ment? when hee takes it not to be so good as his owne, if the eye of the soule, the vnderstanding wherewith it ought to see and discouer the pride of it selfe, if that be full of the same pride, who then can cure it? therefore we are to take heed, we rest not vpon our owne knowledge, and our own vnderstanding, least the Lord giues vs vp to pride, and to an high conceit of it, and so wee bee come incureable in some erroneous opinion, but let vs be carried vp from our excellency in any kinde, to the authour and giuer of it, and that will make vs more humble in in our selues and thank∣full to God. In that, the Apostle setteth out the good Angels by  these word of similitude, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,The good Angels are as good Kings and Princes in the com∣mon wealth. 1. Tim. 2.2. Powers, we are further taught, that they are as good Kings and Princes in the common-wealth, and that as good Kings and Princes are set vp by Gods prouidence, for the good and comfort of the good and godly, and for the pu∣nishment of the wicked, to take vengeance on euill doers, so the good Angels are appointed for the good and pro∣tection of the good and godly, and to execute Gods ven∣geance on such as bee wicked; a point easily prooued in both the branches of it. For the first, Heb. 1. last verse, they are sayd to be ministring spirits, sent foorth to minister for their sakes which shall be heires of saluation,Psal. 34.7. the Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about them, that feare him, and deliuereth them. For the second, wee finde that they as instruments of the wrath of God, destroyed Sodome and Gomorrha, they plagued Aegypt with the death of the first borne, they slew in one night, one hundred foure-score & fiue thousand in Senacheribs host;2. King. 19.55. of this point we may make the same vse the Apostle doth of the power of Prin∣ces and lawfull Gouernours among men, wilt thou (saith he) be without feare of the power? doe well:Rom. 13.34. so shalt thou haue praise of the same: for he is the Minister of God for thy wealth, but if thou doe euill, feare: for he beareth not
the sword for naught: For hee is the Minister of God, to take vengeance on him that doth euill. So in this case it may be sayd, wilt thou bee without feare of the power of Angels,  doe well, learne to feare the Lord, and thou shalt haue comfort by their power:The power of Angels is for the comfort of such as doe well, and for the terrour of the wicked. they then reioyce, yea, then they haue a charge layd vpon them by the Lord, to vse their power, to watch ouer thee, to keepe thee, Psal 91.11. Yea, thou shalt finde the comfortable effect of their mini∣stry, certaine, though the manifestation of it be not ordi∣nary, as they ministred to Christ in his temptation, agony and resurrection; so thou shalt finde, they will minister to thee in all thy troubles, yea, thou shalt finde their prote∣ction ouer thee, if the Lord see it good for thee, in cōmon calamities and miseries, we read Ezechiel 9.4. that a marke was set on them, that mourned in Ierusalem, for all the ab∣hominations that were done in that city, that they should not be swept away, in the common calamity of that city: So then being sealed by the spirit of Christ, and sprinkled in thine heart by the bloud of Christ, if it be good for thee, thou shalt be called out from the wicked, the destroying Angell shall not touch thee, thou shalt not be swept away in a common calamity, which is a matter of excellent com∣fort. On the contrary, if thou bee wicked and prophane, and hast no care to keepe in the wayes of God, then know, the Angels haue not their power in vaine, but at all times are ready to execute Gods vengeance vpon thee. It fol∣loweth, All things were created by him and for him. These words are a repetition of the generall proposition, deliue∣red in the beginning of this verse. For the meaning of them onely, call to minde that they are thus to be concei∣ued: That by the substantiall power of Christ, working together with the Father and holy Ghost, were all things that were not before fremed and made of nothing. This repetition as others in the Scripture is not idle or superflu∣ous, but for speciall causes; First to signifie that the Apo∣stle had not spoken rashly, but aduisedly. Secondly, that
the poynt deliuered is an infallible truth, that all things in∣deed without exception, were made by Christ, as we haue it, Ioh. 1.3. and without it was made nothing that was made. Thirdly, we are to obserue and remember this as fundamentall poynt of religion. The poynt hence to be obscrued is this: That seeing it  pleased the holy Ghost to double his speech,The Lord doubling his speech, we are to double our attention. it must teach vs to double our attention and consideration of the thing deliuered, for where the holy Ghost hath a tongue to speake, we must haue an eare to heare, and an heart to consider, and hee doubling his speech for the more certainty, as the dream was to Pharaoh, Gen. 41.32. to signifie that the thing was established by God, our at∣tention and consideration of it, must be answerable, we are therefore not lightly to passe ouer, but seriously to  consider the worke of creation,The worke of creation is se∣riously to bee considered. it is one of our Sabboths dayes dutie, if yee aske to what end. I answer, That wee may not onely see the wisedome and power of God, but with Dauid be brought to see his infinite goodnesse and mercy towards man, Psal. 8. when I behold thine heauens,Psal. 8 3.4. euen the workes of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordained. What is man, that thou shoul∣dest vouchsafe him so great mercy. And in that the holy Ghost doth sometimes repeat the same thing. We may further make vse of it in this manner. When it pleaseth the Lord to reiterate, and againe to repeat his threatning of iudgement, and when he doth stir vp, and  direct his Ministers often,Threatnings of iudgement against sinne repeated, must not be lightly regarded. and that with vehemency to beat vpon the same sin, we are not lightly to regard those his threatnings, and to thinke the repetition of them idle and vaine, but to confider the infallible and ineuitable certainty of his wrath to come vpon refractary, stub∣borne and hard hearted sinners, for shall the Lord speak the word, and shall not he be as good as his word? shall he that is Lord of heauen & earth threaten iudgements, and that againe, time after time, and many times in pa∣tience
expecting our repentance, and shall not hee at length (if sinners bee not thereby mooued) bring his threatned iudgements vpon them? yes certainely, they are his owne words,Leuit. 26.23. that if they walke stubbornely, a∣gainst him, he will then smite them seuen times, he will pay them home at last. And know it for truth, that if the Lord often by his Ministers denounce iudgements a∣gainst any sinne, be it drunkennesse, swearing or any o∣ther, if men snort and sleepe in that sinne, which by the direction of Gods spirit, is often hit vpon, and still goe on in a damnable course, in dulnesse of minde, and hard∣nesse of heart, the Lord himselfe will then start vp, and re∣uenge his owne contempt vpon them, for then the sinne is growen to a ripenesse,Note. that is the immediate fore-run∣ner of iudgement, and then is the sinne remedilesse, 2. Chro. 36.16. it is sayd ver. 15. the Lord sent to his by his Messengers, often calling them to repentance, but they mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, vntill the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, and till there was no remedy, saith the text: How often would I (saith Christ) haue gathered thy children together,Mat. 23.37. as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings, and ye would not, but now your habitation shall be left desolate. When sinners haue many times beene admonished, and neuer amend, then their sinnes bring iudgements without remedy, and let all vnfeeling hearts thinke vpon it, and take heed how they tempt the Lord ouer long. Come we to the last words, And for him. In these words is layd downe the second argument, by which the Apo∣stle prooues Christ to be eternall God, because all things were made for his glory, and that is the meaning of the words, for though we haue heard it before deliuered, that all things were made for man, yet we are not so to vnder∣stand it, as for the glory of man, but for as inferiour end of the creation, and for the glory of Christ, as hee is God,
and so the chiefe Lord of all things. Christ as God is the perfection of glory in himselfe,  how then can things created serue for his glory? Can they adde glory to him who is maiestie and glory it selfe. Things created serue not to adde any thing to the es∣sence of Christ his glory,  it being infinite in himselfe to the perfection whereof nothing can be added, nor any thing detracted to make it lesse perfect, but they serue to the ma∣nifestation and declaration of that infinite glorie The hea∣uens declare the glory of God,Psal. 19.1. and the firmament sheweth the worke of his hands. Thus all things created serue for the glo∣rie of Christ. In that the Apostle saith, the ende of the creation of all  things is for Christ himselfe, that is, for Christs glory,Gods glory must be the highest end of all our a∣ctions. wee are taught that the glory of God must be the highest ende of all our actions, and whatsoeuer we doe we must make his glory our principall end, and that this duty doth fol∣low from the words of the Apostle, I make it plaine thus, it being the principall ende of things created, it must al∣so bee the chiefe end of the actions of those things, or else things onely idle and not working, should haue reference to Gods glory; and the Lord should haue made things on∣ly doing nothing to serue for his glory, which is most ab∣surde once to thinke: therefore our bodies and soules be∣ing made for Gods glory, all the actions of them both must tend to the same end, it is the conclusion of the Apo∣stle agreeable to this. That whether we eate or drinke,1. Cor. 10.31. or whatsoeuer we doe, it must be done to the glory of God: againe, all actions must tend to some good, or else they are not good. Now the glory of God is the chiefest good, it is put for the goodnesse of God it self,Rom. 9.23. and it is the whole ioy and felicity of the Saints and Angels in heauen, to glorifie God, they are so rauished with the loue of it, that they ne∣uer waxe weary in sounding foorth the praise of God: they cease not day nor night saying, holy, holy, holy,Reuel. 4 8. Lord God almighty, which was, and which is, and which is to come.
Therefore it must be the supreame end of all our acti∣ons,Reproofe of those whole labour ad actions are to the dishonour of God. that is, our dutie, a dutie indeede little thought on by many in the world, many there be, who are so farre from making the glory of God the chiefe end of al their actions as that their liues and actions are nothing else but a conti∣nuall dishonouring of the Lord, they are so loose in their liues, and so giuen ouer to follow the corrupt lusts of their owne hearts, as they cannot abide any that will not poure out themselues to the same excesse of riot, or at least al∣low of it, they hate none more then such as goe about to reforme them; let such persons know that they are like the Deuil and damned in hell, for it is the practise of the Deuill without ceasing, to belch out blasphemy a∣gainst God himselfe, and to labour to make others disho∣nour his name, and as they are like the Deuill in the pra∣ctise, so (without true repentance) they shall bee like him in punishment, yea their owne bodies and soules shall one day witnesse against them, for in them are imprinted such liuely characters of Gods wisdome, power, goodnesse and mercy, that doe so plainely preach to them the glory of God, as they cannot blot out the markes of it, in the parts of their bodies, and the powers of their soules, but being vsed by them in their actions to the dishonour of his maie∣sty, they shall be so many witnesses against them, when the Lord Iesus shall come to iudgement. Let them thinke vpon that. And for further vse of this point, let vs euery one labour to practise the duty now deliuered,Wee are to take heede of seeking our owne glory in doing of good things. and take we heede that sinne doe not insinuate and creepe within our best actions our hearing of the word, our praiers and giuing of almes the discharge of our publike office and function, &c. I know we cannot but sin in our best actions, but my mea∣ning is, we are to labour against the sinne that is contrary to the duty now laide before vs, and that is vaine-glory when men doe not good things in simplicity of heart, ay∣ming at Gods glory principally, but seeke their owne pri∣uate
glory; and aime at the applause and commendation of men, a sin that cannot easily be discerned, it is a branch of inward pride, I therefore leaue the examination to eue∣ry mans conscience, let that tell euery one whether he doe good things in simplicity of heart, ayming principally at Gods glory, or whether in the doing of them hee seeke his owne glory, I will labour to disswade from that sinne, and to that purpose consider these two things. First,Reason Against see∣king our own glory in doing good things. there is no soundnesse of religion in the hart where there is a secret seeking of a mans owne glory, that man that makes it his chiefe end of good actions to be spoken of and admired, doth thereby make knowne that his hart is not sound. How can ye beleeue which receiue honour one of another,Iohn 5.44. and seeke not the honour that commeth  of God alone? Againe, we shall find that though other sinnes haue bin  suffered a long time vnpunished, yet the incroaching on the right of Gods glory, euer brought present iudgements. The builders of the tower of Babell were suffered to goe on in many other sinnes,Gen. 11.4. yet when they came to build to get them a name: they were confounded in their deuises, Nebuchadnezzar a wicked king no doubt, was suffered to go on in many other sinnes, yet when he thought with the maiesty of his person and pallace to outface the Lord,Acts 12. hee became a silly and miserable beast. Herod had long vexed the Church, yet went vnpunished, till taking to himselfe the glory of God, then was hee eaten vp of wormes. And if any thinke these examples of an higher degree of sinne, then is the secret seeking of applause amongst men, let him know, that euen that is a robbing of God of his due honour, and the Lord is not onely carefull, but as I may say curious, or as the Scripture speakes, iealous of his glo∣ry, hee cannot abide it should bee any way touched or im∣payred, surely I will not giue my glory vnto another: ther∣fore they that incroach vppon it in the least measure can∣not escape the iudgement of God,Isay 48.11. if then wee would not
discouer the vnsoundnes of our hearts, if wee would not endanger our selues, suddenly to bee ouertaken by the hand of God let vs take heed we giue no place in our hearts when wee are performing good duties,1. Sam. 2.30. to a secret seeking of our owne glory, but in sincerity aime at Gods glory, and remember for a conclusion of this, what the Lord hath said: they that honour me I will honour, and they that des∣pise me shall be despised. One worde more I will adde touching these words, in that all things were created for the glory of Christ Iesus,All creatures must be vsed to the glory of God. it followes vpon that, that they are to to be vsed, for that end the Lord intended in making creatures, must be driuen at in the vse of the creatures. How then can the Papists ex∣cuse themselues, for their hallowing (as they call it) but in∣deed charming of bread, water, salt, spittle and such like, to  make them able to confer health of body and soule, is this to vse the creatures to the glory of Christ Iesus?Confutation of the Papists. no surely, it is a meere prophanation of the name of God, an abu∣sing of his creatures, to the derogation of the infinite me∣rit of the precious bloud of Christ, and that is an high de∣gree of sinne. VER. 17. And hee is before all things, and in him all things consist. In this verse are propounded two things. First a repetiti∣on of two generall things affirmed of Christ verse. 15. that he is the first borne of euery creature in these words. And he is before all things; then a third argument to proue Christ to be true eternall God, taken from his powerfull preserua∣tion of all things, in the wordes following. And in him all things consist; of these words in order. And he is before all things, these words beeing onely a re∣petition of that which before was deliuered, that hee is the first borne of euery creature, are so to be conceiued, as be∣fore I shewed when I stood vpon these, words, that Christ
was begotten of the substance of his Father from all eter∣nity: and now to deriue hence some further point of in∣struction, we are to marke that the Apostle in the 15. verse, speaking of the eternity of Christ sets it downe by way of similitude and borrowed speech, because as then I noted, we are not able to comprehend it, but by way of shaddow and resemblance, now heere he deliuers the same thing in more plaine termes that he is before all things, to this ende without question, to take away all doubtfulnesse, ambigui∣ty and errour that might bee occasioned from the former similitude. The point I hence gather is this; That whatsoeuer is necessary to be knowne and belee∣ued  of vs to saluation,All things needfull to be knowne and beleeued to saluation are plainely set forth in the Scripture: is in one place of Scripture or other plainely set foorth and easie to bee vnderstood of all them that read diligently, marke attentiuely, pray heartily, and iudge humbly, we shal find, that where any thing necessary to be knowne to saluation is deliuered by trope or figure, or any thing obscurely, the same in another place is expla∣ned, to insist in one or two places, circumcision is called the couenant and in the next verse the signe of the coue∣nant: the Paschall lambe is called the passeouer,Gen: 17.10. Exo. 12.11.21. 1. Cor. 10.4. and verse the 27. the sacrifice of the Lords passeouer. Christ is called a rocke, yet a spirituall rocke by way of exposition, and so that trope in the institution of the Sacrament of the Lords supper, so much abused by the papists, as the ground of their transubstantiation is expounded both by our Sauiour and his Apostle Paul,1. Cor. 11.26. and made plaine to them that are not wilfully blind, for when our Sauior said, do this in remem∣brance of mee, and the Apostle, as oft as ye shall eat this bread and drinke this cup, ye shew the Lords death till hee come, they doe plainly declare that bread & wine be me∣morials and visible signes of the body & bloud of Christ. Is it so,  that euery thing necessary to be knowen and be∣leeued to saluation,Scripture is the best ex∣pounder of Scripture. set downe obscurely in one place of Scripture, is made plaine in another, then we must needs grant that the Scripture is the best expounder of Scrip∣ture,
and that we commonly giue to a man of ordinary vn∣derstanding, that hee is Optimus sui interpres, the best ex∣pounder of his owne meaning, may not bee denied to the wisedome of God reuealed in his word, wee must needes grant that the best way of expounding Scripture, is by Scripture it selfe, & that this point may tend to some spe∣ciall profit of euery one of vs.Note. Learne we hence, that the application of one place of Scripture, must bee with the consideration of another, we are so to apply one place of Scripture to our selues, as that we forget not another; for if we obserue it, wee shall finde that the Diuell doth this way strongly delude and deceiue a great number in the world, hee makes them not rightly apply, but hold to themselues some places of Scripture helping them for∣ward (by their abuse of them) in their sinne with vtter ob∣liuion and forgetfulnesse of another place, that might pull them backe from their sinne, wee may see this his dealing in one particular, in the sinne of presumption, men are bold to sinne, presuming on Gods mercy, and hee will fur∣nish them, with the remembrance of many comfortable places of Scripture, as Psalm. 103.8. the Lord is full of compassion, and Psal. 136. throughout that his mercy en∣dureth for euer, and Psal. 145.9. that his mercies are ouer all his workes, and makes them to entitle themselues to a number of such sentences, sounding nothing but mercy, and thus he doth carry them vp as with a Psalme of mer∣cy, to the highest pitch of presumption, and makes them as it were, lay violent hands, on the comfort found in these places, as if it did belong to them, neuer remembring to apply these together, with that rule of the Apostle, setting downe to whom mercy belongs,Gal. 6.16. wee must take heede of this manner of application of Scripture, there beeing a sweet harmony & consent between the places of scripture, they must be expounded one by another, and applied one with another, for if that be a trueth (as indeed it is) that in comforting the distressed, the promise alone must not bee
applied, but tempered with the threats of the Law, because much guile is in the heart of man, and it is exceeding de∣ceitful, then much more, out of that case of distresse, are we to apply to our selues the comfort of one place of Scrip∣ture, so as we forget not the moderation of it, by another wherein there is either a rule or threatning to keep vs from presumption, we shall finde this practised by Christ him∣selfe, the best example for imitation; we read Math. 4.5.6. When hee was tempted to cast himselfe downe from a pi∣nacle of the temple, that temptation was backed by a com∣fortable place of the Psal. 91.Psal. 91.11.12 He will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp: lst at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone. Our Sauiour did not rest on the consideration of that place al∣ledged, and answer the Deuill as he might, that hee play∣ed the Deuil and left out that which made against him∣selfe, the limitation of the Angels charge, that they must take charge of him, not if hee should come downe head∣long, but vsing the ordinarie meanes of descending, thus he might haue answered that place alone, but to answer the Diuell (which is the thing we are to mark) out of the Law, which is alwaies a cooler of presumption, he said vnto him, it is written againe; Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Thus are we to apply the comfort of one place of Scrip∣ture, with the remembrance of the mitigation of it by an∣other; for otherwise that which should bee our life, will thorow our corruption become our bane, and that which should minister matter of comfort to saluation, will bee a meanes of encouragement to sinne with boldnesse, to our vtter ruine and destruction. I come to the second thing, which is a third argument,Interpre∣tation. proouing Christ to be God, in the words following (and in him all things consist) the words are briefly thus to bee con∣ceiued, that by the powerfull hand of Christ, all things created, are preserued in their essence and state, and su∣stained in their substances, quantities, qualities, motions,
and actions, so as if hee should withdraw his hand they would all perish and come to nothing, hence hee is said to beare vp all things by his mighty word, Heb. 1.3. and to be with his Father, as nourisher of all things, Prou. 8.30. for we must not vnderstand this, and the like places (as I haue often noted) exclusiuely, as shutting out the proui∣dence of God the Father, and of the holy Ghost, but that he together with the Father, and holy Ghost, doth power∣fully preserue all things: now heere, first we are to marke the argument of the Apostle, that he proues Christ to bee true and eternall God by the worke of preseruation, as be∣fore by the creation, that he is the preseruer of all things, and therefore God. Whence it followes that the preserua∣tion  of things in their essence and state is by the mighty power of God,Preseruation of all things in their es∣sence & state is by the migh∣tie ower of of God. 1 Pet. 4.19. for else the argument had not beene good, that is, Christ is the preseruer of all things, and therefore God. Vnlesse preseruation be a proper and peculiar effect of the powerful hand of God, and consider we the ground of this giuen by the Apostle, that God is a faithfull crea∣tor, he did not onely make the heauens, and the earth, and all things in them, and so leaue them as workemen leaue houses, as soone as they haue made them they take away their hands from them; but hee is a faithfull and carefull creator, and doth sustaine things created, and his hand is still with the worke that he hath made, and he holds it vp continually: the preseruation, as well as the creation of al things, is a proper effect of his power. Hence we must learne not to rest in the meanes of our owne preseruation,We must not rest in the means of their preseruation. as meate, drinke, and such like: but we must see, behold and acknowledge in them the powerfull hand of God to sustaine vs and that he worketh by them, and not they without him. Learne we to see in bread, the staffe of bread, as the Lord himselfe calles it, that is, the strength and power to nourish, which comes from the Lord,Leuit. 26.26. and is giuen and taken away at his pleasure; wee shall finde the Lord doth many times teach men this duty
by their owne wofull experience, I meane such as are vn∣mindfull of this duty, that when they see not God in the bread which they eat, hee makes them pine away in the midst of their plenty, the meanes vouchsafed haue not power to doe them good, and all, because they secretly ascribe that to the meanes, which they cannot haue except the Lord blesse them, we therefore are to learne our duty, namely this, not to rest in the meanes of our preseruation, but to see and acknowledge the powerfull hand of God in them, to doe vs good. Now for further vse of this point, heere comes a question to be scanned, that seeing, our preseruation in regard of being and state, is by the mighty power of God, and we finde in the Scripture, that some haue beene preserued in respect of body, by the po∣werfull hand of God, extraordinarily, as Moses in the Mount, Daniel in the Lyons denne, Eliah forty dayes and forty nights, with a course cake and pot of water. The question may bee,  when wee may lawfully expect the extraordinary power and prouidence of God for our preseruation, which is a thing needfull to bee knowen, to keepe vs, that we doe not at all times looke for the extra∣ordinary power of God to preserue vs, for so we shall ma∣ny times tempt the Lord. I answer therefore,  that when ordinary meanes are wan∣ting, and there is no way to come by them, then the faith of the true beleeuer may rest on the extraordinary proui∣dence of God, and we may then perswade our selues, that the Lord (if he see it good) will send helpe extraordinarily. When the people of Israel are at the red sea, and see no way how to escape their enemies, then they may look that the Lord will deuide the sea, and giue them passage tho∣row it; when Daniel is cast into the Lyons den, hee may then expect Angels to come and close the Lyons mouths, the Scripture is plentifull in examples of this kinde, but on the other side, when ordinary meanes are to be had, then it is contempt of Gods ordinance and presumption not to
vse them, but to expect extraordinary helpe from heauen. When Elisha and his seruant were alone in Dotham,2. Kings 6.17. and without meanes of defence, then hee might lawfully ex∣pect his garrison of Angels, but vers. 32. where ordinary meanes were to be had, then he did not looke for such ex∣traordinary helpe, but vsed the meanes offered, hee shuts the doore, and bids them handle the messenger roughly, and thus this question is answered, that when ordinary meanes cannot bee had, then wee may looke for the ex∣traordinary, when they may bee had wee are to vse them, yet so as wee rest not vpon them, but see in them and by them the powerfull working of the Lord. One thing more is offered vnto vs from these wordes, and that is a matter of comfort to all true beleeuers,The Church of Christ is preserued by his prouidēce in speciall manner. Psa. 18.1.2. name∣ly this, in that all things are preserued by Christ, it cannot be but that his Church, his body, is kept and preserued by his prouidence in specall manner Isay. 27.3. the Lord saith he keepes his vineyard, and hee will water it, and Dauid found such safety & security vnder the speciall prouidence of God as hee was not able (as it should seeme) with any words to expresse, and therefore he vseth all these meta∣phors, my rocke, my castle, my fortresse, my buckler, my shield, &c. Now the same God is the same castle, and shield, and fortresse, & bulwarke, and deliuerer from all enemies and from the Deuill and his instruments, to all them that put their trust in him for euer. Ps. 17.8. Dauid prayed for speci∣all defence keepe me as the apple of the eye, hide me vnder the shadow of thy wings, he prayed (no doubt) in faith with assurance that the Lord would so keepe him, & doth so keepe all his children, now who will not warily keep the apple of his eye, it is the tendrest thing and that part of the body that men are most carefull of, and euen as the apple of the eye doth the Lord Iesus keepe his,  if then Iesus Christ be our keeper,If Christ keep vs we neede feare nothing. whom need we feare, do but remem∣ber that which wee haue in this text, that in him all things consist, and the motion of all things is from and by his
power, though sinfull motions as they are sinfull are from the wicked themselues, yet as motions they are from the Lord, and they cannot moue the least finger, but as rhey are sustained by him, why then should we feare them? no, no, know that the hand of Christ Iesus is with thee, thou that art a member of him) both in life and death, yea his hand shall keepe the very dust of his owne, when they are dead; let this therefore sinke and settle into euery one of our hearts, that Iesus Christ is our keeper, and it will make vs loue him, cleaue to him, and be of good courage in the waues of the sea of this troublesome world and feare no∣thing. VER. 18. And he is the head of the body of the Church: he is the beginning, and the first borne of the dead, that in all things he might haue the preeminence. The Apostle hauing spoken in the three verses going before of the dignity of Christ his person in respect of his deity and so proued the sufficiency of the work of redemp∣tion wrought by him. Now hee comes to speake of his dignity, as he is God and man by personall vnion, & with∣all teacheth by way of implication, how Gods chosen are made partakers of that redemption, namely by their vni∣on and communion with Christ, that he is their head, and they his members: the things affirmed of Christ in this verse, setting forth the dignity of Christ his person as God and man are three. First that he is the head of the body of the Church. Secondly the beginning. Thirdly the first borne of the dead. To which points of glory is added the end of them all in the last words, that in all things hee might haue the pree∣minence. Come we to speake of these, as they are laid downe in order. And he is the head of the body of the Church, the
words head and body are metaphorically borrowed from knowne things,Interpreta∣tion. and doe signifie that relation that is be∣tweene Christ and his Church, that there is the same rela∣tion betweene him and his Church, that there is between the head and the body, and that in many respects, that as the head and body are knit together by nerues, and by the soule, so Christ and his Church are vnited and knit to∣gether by the band of Faith, and the spirit, as the head hath an eminency and excellency, and the body is vnder in place and dignity; so Christ hath an eminency and excel∣lency aboue the Church, and the Church is vnder him in place and dignity, as the head giues naturall life, sence and motion to the body, and the body receiues those things from the head, so Christ giues spirituall life and motion to the church, & the church receiues such life and motiō frō Christ, and as the head doth guide, gouerne and defend the body, and the body is guided, gouerned, & defended by the heade, so is it betweene Christ and his Church. In these things specially standeth that similitude and re∣semblance of Christ and his Church to an head, and the members of a natural body, and that wee may yet better conceiue the meaning of the wordes, two questions are briefly to bee answered which serue much for the vnder∣standing of that relation, that is betweene Christ and his Church, compared to an head or bodie. 2. QuestionsFirst, there beeing in Christ two natures, the question may be in respect of which of these two is Christ the head  of his Church, and vnited to it, and to euery member. Secondly, what manner of vnion it is, whereby Christ & his Church are vnited.  For the first I answere, that Christ is the head of his Church in respect of both his natures, e∣uen whole Christ God and man is the head of his church, for hee is so the head as hee is the Sauiour of his Church, they are conioyned by the Apostle, Christ, saith the A∣postle is head of his Church,Ephes. 5.23. as the husband is the wiues head, and the same is the Sauior of his body. Now Christ
is the Sauiour of his Church, not according to his diuine nature only, nor only according to his humane nature, but whole Christ in his Godhead, in his soule and flesh, and therefore whole Christ is the head of his Church, and the Church, and euery true member of it, is vnited to whole Christ, yet in this order: first to the flesh and manhood of Christ, and then by that, to the Godhead, because,Note. as there is no vnion of man with God, being seuered from him by sin, but by a mediator, so is there no coniunction with the Godhead of Christ, but by his flesh in which he performed the chiefe works of mediation, & that for the first question To the second I answer,Answere to the 2. Question. that the vnion whereby Christ and his Church are vnited, though it bee a true and reall vnion, yet is it not naturall, as two ioined in one nature nor personall, as of body and soule, nor politicall, as of Prince and people, but mysticall and Spirituall, by the bond of the same spirit and faith. Now lastly, the word (Church) signifieth the whole num∣ber  of Gods chosen, wheresoeuer called and sanctified;Christ is the onely head of the vniuer∣sall Catholke Church. this then is the full sense and meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had said, Christ both God and man, in respect of both his natures, is after a spirituall manner, knit to all Gods elect, called and sanctified, and is more eminent and excellent, they giuing spiritual life and motion vnto them, and doth guid, gouerne and defend them. From the words thus vnderstood we may first conclude, that Christ onely is the head of the vniuersall Catholike Church, for though euery King may in good sense be cal∣led the head of the particular visible Church of his domi∣nion, which is a body distinct from the whole Church, yet of the whole Church, being one bodie consisting of all the members of it, there can be but one head, & that is Christ, because he onely is knit to Gods elect, called and sanctifi∣ed by mysticall vnion, he only giues spirituall life and mo∣tion to all the members of the Church, yea, the Papists themselues. against whom I note this, who say, that the
Pope is the head of the Church,Confutation of the papists. Ephes. 1.22. in their annotations on Ephes. 1.22. confesse that the Church in no sence can bee called the body of the Pope; and therefore we may con∣clude, that he cannot be the head of the vniuersall Church, as for their new coined distinction of head imperiall, and ministeriall, it is not only without warrant from the word, but foolish, and doth imply a contradiction; for to be head argueth preheminence, as saith the Apostle in the ende of this verse, and to be ministeriall argueth subiection and in∣feriority, therefore head ministeriall can neuer agree to the same subiect. And so I leaue this point, and come to ano∣ther, in that the Apostle sets down that relation that is be∣tweene Christ and his Church, by this similitude that he is as an head, and the Church as a body, wee are taught that there is a most neere vnion, and coniunction betweene Christ and his Church, euen as neere as there is betweene the head of a man and his body, yea more neere, for the  head of a man may bee cut off, but Christ is ioined with his members inseparably,There is a most neere v∣nion between Christ & his Church. all opposite strength and power of Hell can neuer be able to separate him from his Church and members; and hence it is that the word (Christ) is put many times for the Church of Christ, because Christ and his Church are so neerely conioined, for all the body is one, and euen so is Christ, that is the Church of Christ, as appeares in the very next verse, for by one spirit are wee all baptized into one body.1. Cor. 12.12. Now to Abraham and his feede were the promises made, he saith not, vnto the seedes as speaking of many;Gal. 3.16. but vnto thy seede, as of one which is Christ: where the word (Christ) signifieth not onely the head or mediator, God and man, but also the Church ga∣thered and called by the preaching of the Gospell, Ephes. 1.2 3. the Church is called not only the body, but the com∣plement of Christ, this is further manifest by another si∣militude vsed by the Apostle, namely of man and wife in mariage, that as the Husband and Wife in car∣nal mariage are vnited most neerely into one flesh, and are
indeed till death or lawfull diuorce by the bond of marri∣age, one flesh euen so neere or rather neerer (because death cannot seuer them) is the coniunction betweene Christ and his Church, thus the Apostle hath taught, Ephes. 5.31.32. where he doth apply the words concerning carnall marriage, to the coniunction betweene Christ and his Church, for this cause shall a man leaue father and mother, and shall cleaue to his wife, and they twaine shall bee one flesh; this is a great secret, but I speake concerning Christ and concerning the Church. The point thus cleared, let vs come to the vse; First it  may serue to strengthen the faith of all true beleeuers tou∣ching their iustification by Christ his righteousnesse im∣puted vnto them,Strength to our faith tou∣ching iustifi∣cation by Christ his righteousnesse imputed. for there being that neere coniunction betweene Christ and his Church, as is betweene the head and the body, it must needs bee, that the graces and bene∣fits of Christ doe truely and really belong to all his mem∣bers, and what he did as mediatour, by the couenaunt of grace is truly imputed vnto them and made theirs by true faith, for what is done by the head in a naturall body, may truely be ascribed to the whole body, so what Christ did as mediator, he being the head of his Church, is truely impu∣ted to all his members. The Papists say it is but a fancie of an idle braine, to hold that the righteousnesse of Christ, and his merits are made ours by imputation, it is all one (say they) as if wee should say, one man doth liue by the soule of another, and yet they say that the merit of the good worke of one member of Christ, by reason of that communion that is betweene the members, may be com∣municated and applied to another, which I speake, not onely to shew the error in the thing it selfe,Papists erre and differ in their owne o∣pinions. for it is false to say, that there is any such power giuen to any, to merit for himselfe and for other, but to let vs see, how absurd, and how forgetfull they are of their owne assertion, and let vs leaue them to vanish in their owne iarring and dissenting opinions, and let vs learne to acknowledge it a certaine
truth, and labour to be strengthened in the perswasion of it, as grounded on the neer vnion of Christ & his Church, that as many as truely beleeue in Christ, stand iust in the sight of God,Ephes. 5.30. by Christ his righteousnesse, euen his by in∣herency, but ours giuen and apprehended by faith. Let that suffice for the first vse. Againe, is this a trueth, that there is a most neere vnion between Christ and his members,Harme done to any mem¦ber of Christ, reacheth vp to Christ himselfe. euen so neer as between the head and the body, then let all such as harme any member of Christ, happily a silly man or woman in the sight of the world, let them know that the harme done resteth not vpon the person harmed, but reacheth vp euen to Christ Iesus in heauen, as harme done to the least fin¦ger, reacheth to the head, and sometime causeth the head to drop downe teares: so the harme that is done to any member of Christ reacheth to him.Exod. 15.7. Moses saith the ene∣mies of the Church rose vp against God. The Lord saith, he that toucheth his people,Zach. 2.8. toucheth the apple of his eye, and that knowen speech of Christ from Heauen, may heer be remembred Act. 9.4. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? in my members, and by my members, let this strike terror and amazement to all wicked persons, who load the mem∣bers of Christ with iniuries and wrongs, in word & deed; when thou doest cast disgrace and contempt, by opprobri∣ous tearmes, vpon a silly man or woman, beleeuing in Christ; thou doest it to Christ his head in Heauen, and know that thou mightest as well spit in the face of Christ himselfe; and a man will not suffer the least member of his body to be pinched if he can hinder it, and shall Christ to whom all power is giuen in heauen and earth, suffer any of his members bought with so deare a price, as his owne precious bloud be wronged, & reuenge it not? no certain¦ly, such wrongs ring in the ears of the head of the Church Christ Iesus, and will cause him one day to come downe in flaming fire, to consume them that abuse his members. Yea, it is to bee thought on and considered that the head
of the Church is such an head, as doth know not only the wrongs done to his members,Note. but the secret intents of mis∣chiefe also, and the very purpose of euill against any of them, for hee is not onely man, but God also, a searcher of the secret thoughts of all hearts, let not then any man-thinke that he can wrong a member of Christ so secretly, as that the wrong done, shall be smoothered in the place where it is done, & neuer come to light, for why, it moun∣teth vp aboue the sunne, euen to Cnrist in Heauen, yea, hee sees and knowes thy malice against any of his mem∣bers, lurking in the depth and bottome of thy heart, it is a corruption as old as Caine, to hide, cloake and shadow cankor and malice, and to thinke that it reacheth no fur∣ther than a mans owne bosome, but we are to know, that it reaching to a member of Christ, though not in act, but onely in thought, it reacheth to Christ, and is not onely seene and knowen of him, but it toucheth him, and hee hath a feeling of it, and without repentance and change of minde and affection, hee will punish it as intended a∣gainst himselfe; let this be thought on and remembred of all those that wrong their brethren, in the secret thought of their hearts: it may be, and I make no question of it, but many men and women neuer thought of this, that their secret malice reached so high as heauen, let vs now there∣fore learne it, and for conclusion of this point, remember what the Lord sayth to Abraham,Gen. 12.3. I will blesse them that blesse thee, and curse them that curse thee: all that truely be∣leeue in Christ, haue him a friend to themselues, blessing them in their owne persons, and a friend blessing all that are friends to them, and a foe to all false hearts, harboring and hatching mischiefe against them, which is a matter of  great comfort to them,All the actuall members of Chrst are in speciall man∣ner vnder Christ. and of dreadfull terrour to all that hate them. By this relation betweene Christ and his Church, com∣pared to an head and a body, we are further taught, that all the actuall members of Christ, as many as are truely
knit to him by the bond of his spirit, and faith they are in speciall manner vnder Christ, yea, so as they are quickned by him, and haue spirituall life communicated vnto them from him, as the head doth quicken and giue life to the members of the body, and gouerne them in speciall man∣ner, so Christ in speciall manner doth quicken & gouerne his members; in speciall manner wee need not seeke farre for the proofe of this; let vs but looke backe to the last words of the verse fore-going, and consider them together with these words, and the point will easily appeare very plaine: In Christ all things generally whatsoeuer consist, that is, all things by his powerfull hand are preserued and sustained, his generall prouidence is ouer all creatures, but when the Apostle comes to set downe what hand and go∣uernment Christ hath ouer his Church, he saith, in respect of his Church, he is as the head to his Church, hee doth guide and gouerne it, as the head doth the members, this is also the doctrine of the Apostle, where speaking of the exaltation of Christ raised from the dead, and set at the heauenly places, for aboue all principalities and powers, and might and dominion,Ephes. 2.20.21.22.23. and euery name that is named, not in this world onely, but also in that that is to come, he saith that all things whatsoeuer; yea, his very enemies will they nill they, are made subiect vnto him, but how? vn∣der his feet, there is the manner of their subiection, and his Church also is made subiect vnder him, but how? as the body to the head saith the Apostle, where we see a ma∣nifest difference of subiection of other things, and of the Church vnto Christ, and withall, as plaine a difference of that hand and gouernment, that Christ hath ouer other things, and ouer his Church, that hee hath a generall do∣minion ouer other things, & that he gouernes his Church, and the members of it in speciall manner, yea, so as hee doth quicken and giue life to them, the ground of this is, because there is the same spirit in Christ,1. Cor. 6i 17. and in his mem∣bers, for as the Apostle sayth, hee that is ioyned vnto the
Lord is one spirit. The same spirit the fountaine of life and grace dwelling in Christ, and in his members, must needs quicken, sanctifie and make them holy as hee is, in their measure, and as the same soule being in the head and members, doth quicken both head and members, the head as the chiefe seat of life and sence, and the body as it is ca∣pable, and euery member as is fit for particular duty and function. Now this for the vse  of it,Triall and ex∣amination of our selues. may serue as a ground of tri∣all and examination, euery one will bee held as a member of Christ, receiue the Sacrament, to seale vp their vnion with him, but where is that conformity to Christ the head of his Church, in a measure of holinesse? where is life of Christ conuayed from him to his members by his Spirit? where is almost that man or that woman, that can truely say with the Apostle, I liue, yet not I,Gal. 2.20. that is in the corrup∣tion of my nature, but Christ liueth in me, and in that, I now liue in the flesh, I liue by the faith in the sonne of God, who hath loued mee and giuen himselfe for mee, can wee perswade our selues that we are members of Christ, and yet liue as many doe, the life of nature onely, as they are led by the light of nature, some thinke they are in good case, because they deale truely and iustly withall, & liue peace∣ably with their neighbours, things indeed commendable in themselues, and excellent if they come from a good root, yet they are such as may be in naturall men, meere heathen men haue had them, shall we then from these con∣clude that we are members of Christ? shall any man think that he is knit to Christ, who is so farre from being ordered by his spirit in speciall manner, as that he is altogether gui∣ded by the inward corruption and lust of his owne heart, and by the outward temptation of the Diuell, yea, some∣times doth euen tempt the Diuell to tempt him; it may seem strange there should be any so giuen ouer to the cor∣ruption of his owne heart,Note. yet such there bee too many in the world, who euen tempt the Diuell to tempt them, and
they are such as dispose themselues to sinne, such as make themselues fit for the committing of sinne, and make rea∣dy their hearts as an ouen, as saith the Prophet, for exam∣ple,Hosea. 7.6. the drunkard makes his tongue fit for swearing, ray∣ling, ribald and filthy speaking, the idle person his body fit for vncleannesse, for thus to dispose themselues to sinne, is a discouering of the inward corruption of their hearts, it is all one, as if a man should shew his mony to a theefe, wat∣ching for his prey in a dangerous place, or for a man to offer his naked breast to the stab of a deadly malicious e∣nemy, thirsting after his bloud: so they offer themselues as a prey to the Diuell, and vncouer their corrupt hearts in the sight of the Diuell, seeking such aduantage to allure them to thrust them through with his dart of sinne. Now then can any man thus led by his owne corruption, and the temptation of Satan, yea many times (as I haue shew∣ed) tempting the Diuell to tempt him, perswade himselfe that he is a member of Christ? hee might as well thinke that the shooes on his feet are parts of his body, it is but a fancy; we are to know it for a certaine truth, that as ma∣ny as are knit vnto Christ, they are gouerned by him in speciall manner, and he liues in them by his spirit. And that we may haue some more speciall direction in this case, and may knowe when wee are gouerned by the spirit of Christ,Notes of the infallible pre∣sence and ha∣bitation of Christ his spi¦rit. Rom. 7.24. take these two notes of the infallible presence and habitation of his spirit. First, a feeling of the masse and body of our owne cor∣ruption, with a loathing of it, and a desire to be deliuered from it, as Paul saith, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death. There was in him a feeling and a loathing of his owne corruption so is it with all them that haue the same spirit, for nature ne∣uer feeles corruption with dislike, but only grace: so long as it is felt onely by nature, it is followed with delight, yea, the naturall man holds it his chiefe felicity, when he may follow the swinge of his owne corrupt heart, and nothing
grieues him more, then when that hee is crossed by some griping of an accusing and yelling conscience. The second note of the presence and habitation of the Spirit of Christ is an vnfaigned purpose of heart to obey God in all his commaundements according to place and calling with an inclination of heart vnto those commaun∣dements. Barnabas exhorted the people of Antioch,Acts. 11.23. Act. 11.23. that with purpose of heart, they would cleaue vnto the Lord. I say an vnfained purpose of heart, because euen Pharaoh and the most wicked in the worlde, sometimes when Gods hand is heauy vpon them, when they are sicke or the like, they promise to amend and request others to pray for them, but yet as the Lord himselfe complaines, Hosea 5.4. they will not giue their mind to turn vnto their God, they doe it not from their heart, when they are reco∣uered they forget what they promised, because they pro∣mised not in truth of heart, their promise cume not out from an hatred of sinne, but rather from an hatred of the commandement of God, and a sence of their present mi∣sery. Therefore I say an vnfained purpose of heart, with a ready and cheerfull inclination of heart,Psal. 119.106. to all holy obedi∣ence, such as was in Dauid, a purpose bound with an oath and a holy couenant made to the Lord to keep them from starting, I haue sworne and will performe it, that I wil keep thy righteous iudgements: by these two things found in vs, wee may know that wee bee gouerned by the spirit of Christ but if these be wanting, we deceiue our selues, if wee think we are members of Christ, we haue then no coniun∣ction with Christ the head of his Church, we are not bran∣ches of the true vine but shall bee cast out as vnprofitable branches, and let vs tremble to thinke vpon that which followeth vpon this, (namely) this, that as in this life,Iohn 15.6. wee haue but a supposed vnion & coniunction with Christ, an vnion with him only in our conceipt, so in the life to come we shall haue but an imaginary communion and fellow∣ship with him, and in deed & truth a finall separation from
him, his Saints and Angells, and fellowship with the De∣uill and his Angells, they that haue not Christ their head and Sauiour in this life shall haue him their iudge and condemner in the life to come: and they deceiue them∣selues who thinke they may liue as the limmes of Satan, and yet die the members of Christ. The next thing wee  haue to marke from those words is this that the Apostle saith,The members of Christ ought to haue one heart, and one affection. Christ is the head not simply of the Church, but of the body of the Church, hence wee are taught that the members of Christ ought to haue one heart, and one affec∣tion, to loue as members of one and the same body, to be kind one to another, and to make much one of another, we find this argument and manner of reasoning plainely, prouing this duty vrged in many places of the Scripture, If there be threfore any consolation in Christ,Phil. 2.1.2. any comfort of loue, if any fellowship of the spitit, if any compassion and mercy: fulfill my ioy, that ye be like minded, hauing the same loue, being of one accord, and of one iudgement we haue the same ground of exhortation, vrging this duty, that we support one another through loue.Ephes. 4.4. Why so? there is one body and one spirit saith the Apostle, it is recorded Act, 4.32. that the multitude of them that beleeued were of one heart, and of one soule, the reason no doubt was this, because though they were a multitude, yet they were all one body, and it were monstrous to haue two hearts in one body. This duety belongs to all that professe them∣selues members of Christ,  and it ought to be effectuall, to ioyne vs together in one hart and affection many reasons might be brought to moue vs to loue one another,All that call themselues members of Christ must learn this du∣ty to be knit together in one heart. as our agreement and coniunction in one nature, country, place, habitation, law, liberty and religion, which are all of great waight to moue vs to mutuall loue, but aboue all, this is of greatest waight, and most effectuall that wee are members of the mysticall body of Christ, the very light and order of nature, teacheth the members of the same body, to loue and to tender one another: no man euer yet hated
his owne flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, Eph, 5:29: wee cannot bring instance or example of any well in his wits that did euer hate or hurt his owne body wilfully. If then the consideration of this, that we are members of one body, moue vs not to loue and tenderly to affect one ano∣ther, it will conuince vs of sinne against the light of na∣ture, yea against the light of grace, and the supernaturall light of the holy ghost reuealing vnto vs that wee are knit together by one Spirit, one faith, one hope of saluation, yea it will conuince vs of want, of loue to the Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, who thought not his owne bloud too dear for vs, but testified his loue towards vs by shedding of his bloud to redeeme vs, and therefore we ought to loue him againe, but if we loue not one another, it is a plaine eui∣dence against vs that we loue not Christ, for hee hath set o∣uer that loue that hee requireth of vs in lieu of his loue to∣wards vs to be answered vnto him in his members, he will haue it seene how we loue him, and esteeme his benefits by our loue to his members, therefore he saith to Peter, louest thou me, then feed my lambs, as if he had said, shew thy loue to me vpon them, and in doing good to them: if then wee would not be conuinced of breaking the order & course of nature of repelling the worke of grace, of quenching (as much as in vs) the supernaturall light of the holy ghost of want of loue to the Lord Iesus to whom wee owe our selues, our soules and bodies, let vs bee stirred to loue one another, to bee kinde and friendly one to another, as the members of one body, and for conclusion of this let vs re∣member what the Apostle hath said, if ye bite & deuoure one another, take heede lest ye be consumed one of ano∣ther, if ye fasten your teeth one in another, as we do when we break out into bitter termes of railing & reuiling one another, it is all one as if a man should bite of the flesh of his owne body, and if that bee odious in nature for a man so to deale with his owne flesh, let vs remember that wee are members of one body, and therfore ought to loue one
another, and it must bee farre from vs to wrong one ano∣ther in word or deede. Now to the second thing heere affirmed of Christ set∣ting forth the dignity of his person, as he is God and man, (that he is the beginning) and for the vnderstanding of the wordes, some thing must bee supplied, the word (be∣ginning) beeing a worde of relation, hauing reference to something, whereof it is a beginning, some referre it to all things,Interpreta∣tion. that he is the first efficient cause of all things which is true, but that cannot so well agree to this place, because the Apostle hath spoken of that in the verse going before, but the relation of it must be to somthing within the com∣passe of this verse either to the Church or to the resurrecti∣on of the dead; and I take it, it may most fitly be referred to the Church, the chosen of God called and sanctified, because the Apostle speaks of the resurrection of the dead in the next words the speech of the Apostle in the original runnes thus,  hee is the head, &c: who is the beginning; thus then as I take it) wee are to supply this second affir∣mation, he is the beginning of the Church, from him the Church and the chosen of God, haue their originall and beginning, now the question may be how hee is the begin∣ning of the Church? By shedding of his bloud on the crosse, as Eue was fra∣med and made of the rib that was taken out of Adams side, so the Church is framed and made of the bloud shedding and streaming out of the side of Christ crucified, for by his bloud saith the Apostle, Ephes. 2.13.Ephes. 2.13. They which were farre off are made neere, and the chosen of God haue re∣demption through his bloud, verse the 14. of this chapter and as the Authour to the Hebrewes saith 10.19. by the bloud of Christ they haue entrance,Colos. 1.14. and vers. 12. it is a new and a liuing way, it hath an efficacy and power in it-quick∣ning and giuing life. The Church was before Christ shed his bloud, ab initio mundi, how then is the shedding of the bloud of Christ
the beginning of the Church? Christ indeed shed his bloud onely then,  when hee was manifested in the flesh, after many yeares of the worlds continuance, yet his death was as effectuall from the be∣ginning of the world, as when hee did hang on the crosse, all the Patriarks and Saints that liued before Christ his comming in the flesh were saued by it as well as any other after his death. Therefore it is said Reuel. 13.8 that he was the lambe slaine from the beginning of the world. Thus then are we to conceiue these words, that Christ is the be∣ginning of the Church; of his bloudshed is the Church framed and quickned. Now to the Doctrine, in that Christ by shedding his  bloud is the beginning of the Church,Out of death commeth life to Gods cho∣sen. wee are taught thus much, that euen out of death commeth life to Gods cho∣sen, Christ giues life vnto them, not by life, but by death, which is a point that may easily be confirmed: for if wee looke to the Lords manner of working, not onely in this particular, but in many others, we shall finde, that he com∣monly workes all things in his creatures by the contrary, he creates things that are, not of somthing, but of nothing; he makes light shine out of darknesse, hee brings water, not out of a fountaine, but out of an hard stony rocke; And this the Lord doth, not onely in the worke of creation and preseruation, but also of the conuersion of a sinner; therein it pleaseth him to work ordinarily by the preaching of the Gospell, which is as contrary to the nature of man, as fire to water, for there is no seed of the Gospell in nature, but as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 2.14 the things of the spirit are foolishnesse vnto the naturall man: yet by the foolishnes of preaching, it pleaseth God to saue them that beleeue. 1. Corin. 1.21. and thus doth he also in the worke of our re∣demption, as one saith, if we consider Christ on the crosse, we shall see our paradice not in heauen, but in the middest of hell; out of his cursed death, doth he bring life and sal∣uation to Gods chosen.
The reason of this is, that his power might more appear and the worke to his glory,  for then doth the Lord shew himselfe most powerfull when hee workes by contraries, and then especially doth he so work, when he hath any ex∣cellent thing to worke to his owne glory. And for vse of this, let it be laid vp as a ground of excel∣lent and sweet comfort in euery true beleeuing heart, for why is it so, that the Lord workes the life and saluation of his chosen, out of that which seemes most contrary, the cursed death of the crosse, then let euery true beleeuer vp∣on consideration of this,Consolation against de∣spaire in great extremity. bee comforted and strengthened against despaire in his great extremity; let him remember it is the Lords wonted manner of working, to bring riches out of pouerty, ioy out of sorrow, mirth out of mour∣ning, glory out of shame, life out of death, happinesse out of misery, heauen out of hell; and that such is the Lords power, that he workes commonly by contraries, and with∣all, his mercy is as his power towards his children, and it will bee a notable meanes to establish his heart with com∣fort in the greatest blast of trouble, yea, bee it so, that the trouble be inward in soule and conscience, that he feeles the terrours of God fighting against him, and the Lord shewes tokens of his anger and heauy displeasure, yet if e∣uer before hee truely felt the sweetnesse of Gods mer∣cy in Christ, the consideration of this the Lords man∣ner of dealing may stay him from beeing vtterly deiected and cast downe, and may assure him, that euen out of that trouble the Lord in his season will worke his greater con∣solation and comfort, I know it is an hard matter, thus to be comforted in a mans owne particular affliction, to haue it in speculation and knowledge, that out of one contrary the Lord brings another,Note. before speciall triall come, is no hard matter, but when the case is our owne, and our soules feel trouble vpon them, then to be perswa∣ded, that out of that trouble the Lord will bring comfort, and on that ground to bee comforted it is hard, because
there reason is strong against it, and corruption wil be stir∣ring, and somtimes rise vp in contradiction in the best, we read Act. 9. that Ananias would scarsely beleeue the Lord himselfe in this point, though indeed the case was not his owne, when the Lord told him verse the 11. that out of the persecuting spirit of Paul, hee had wrought an holy profession, and made him, who before was a persecu∣tour, an holy professour, and that out of such infidelity, he had brought such faith, Ananias would hardly beleeue it, but beganne to reason the matter with the Lord, verse 13. yea, to dispute and bring arguments against it, that hee had heard of many, it was Vox populi, that hee had done much euill, backed and countenanced with authority, and so he thought it impossible, that Paul should be conuerted and brought to the faith, thus doth reason and corruption many times stand vp in opposition, to this ground of com∣fort, that out of one contrary, the Lord worketh another, especially in a particular case of affliction, therefore that wee may bee helped, and haue our hearts established with comfort, in time of neede vpon this ground, we must fur∣ther call to minde, and follow that notable rule of grace, that in case of affliction,A rule to bee followed in case of affli∣ction. reason and feeling must bee laide aside, faith must bee predominant, and rule aboue reason and feeling, we are not to iudge of our future estate accor∣ding to our present feeling, (for then wee shall perswade our selues it is desperate) but according to the word and promise of God, who hath promised then to send helpe to his children, when sense tels them it is farthest off, and they are almost swallowed vp of trouble, and to this, pur∣pose, looke on the example of the Saints of God, in for∣mer times, Psal. 130.1. Out of deepe places, saith Dauid,Dauid. haue I called, and when he was plunged into the deepes of distressed conscience, hee laide aside his reason and sense, and by his faith rested on the earnest promise which made him send vp earnest praier to God: when MosesMoses. at the red sea, as we read, Exod. 14. was in extreame anguish, he saw
present death euery way, the people cried against him vers. 11. Hast thou brought vs to die in the wildernesse, be∣cause there were no graues in Aegypt? And no doubt, as Luther saith, he felt in his heart a mighty cry of the Deuill against him,Exod. 14.11.12. saying; All this people shall this day perish, for they can escape no way, and thou shalt be found guil∣ty of this great calamity, as the author of it, because thou hast led them out of Aegipt: Moses in his extremitie, by his faith broke through his owne sense, feeling, and aprre∣hension, and cast himselfe by faith on the promise, and so cried vnto the Lord with assurance that hee would giue him deiuerance, thus must we doe in time of our particu∣lar affliction, we must lay aside reason and sense, and by faith rest on the promise of God, and then this ground of comfort, that out of one contrary the Lord can fetch ano∣ther, will be truly comfortable, and we shall bee fully per∣swaded of the truth of it, that out of our particular afflicti∣on, the Lord will worke our speciall consolation, and we shall be strengthned against despaire in our greatest extre∣mities. A second thing offered from these words, is this: In that Christ is the beginning of his Church by the  shedding of his bloud, and the Church beginnes at the crosse of Christ.Euery true member of the Church must fetch the beginning of his spirituall life and salua∣tion from the Crosse of Christ. We are hence further taught: that euery true member of the Church, must thence deriue and fetch his beginning euen the beginning of his spirituall life and saluation, hee must bee able to say, he hath the beginning of his life, and saluation, from the bloud of Christ, in the very act of the shedding of it. How is that to be done, may some say? Answer in the words of the Apostle, Rom. 6.8. by be∣ing dead with Christ,  and Galat. 2.19. by being crucified with Christ, and that is done by beleeuing, not only that Christ died for him, and by apphending the merit of his death, but by spreading himselfe vpon the crosse of Christ and beleeuing that himselfe was crucified with Christ, and
so feeling the power of his death to kill sinne in him; a point of faith not knowen to many in the world, it is a subtilty and sleight of the Diuell, to blind-fold men in this case, to make them content themselues with a conceipt, (for indeed it is no true faith but a fancy) that they haue true comfort in Christ, if they beleeue or rather think, that Christ was crucified for them, and yet neuer beleeue, that they were crucified with him,  and we must know that this is not sufficient,Wee must therefore find our selues cru∣cified with Christ. this is not to goe to the first ground of true comfort, this is to take hold of that which happily be∣longs not vnto vs (namely) the merit of Christ his death, which appertaines to none but to his members crucified with him, if wee would finde true comfort in Christ, wee must not rest in the fruit and merit of his death, but go to the very root of comfort, the bloud of Christ streaming out of his body on the crosse, and there finde our selues crucified with him. If you aske how a man shall know that he is crucified with Christ? The Apostle hath taught vs Rom. 6.6.7.  when the old man, that is our naturall corruption, is mortified by the power of Christ his death, as a man executed and put to death, ceaseth from thefts, murders, treasons and the like, so if thou be crucified with Christ, thou shalt finde thy selfe to cease from thy old sinnes and corruptions. Let this e∣uer bee the ground of our comfort in Christ that wee are crucified with him: euen a wicked reprobate may in his conceit pull to himselfe the merit of Christ, & please him∣selfe with a deceiuing comfort, but he is neuer able to goe thus farre, to finde himselfe crucified with Christ, to fetch the beginning of his comfort from the very body of Christ bleeding on the crosse. If then thou wouldest goe further and fetch thy comfort in Christ, from the very first ground and beginning of true comfort, thou must de∣riue it from the side of Christ vpon the crosse, and finde thy selfe a member of that body, I meane the Church,
that issued out of the side of Christ, and was framed of his bloud, that is, thou must finde thy selfe ctucified with Christ. One thing more wee may gather from these words (namely this) that the bloud of Christ is a most precious thing,The bloud of Christ is a most precious thing. it is here made the seed of the Church, from whence the Church takes her beginning; it is the bloud of God so called, Act. 20.28. it is the price of redemption expia∣tory, and clensing from sinne, and we must learne so to e∣steeme the bloud of Christ, as it is in it selfe precious, so let vs accompt it precious vnto vs,  there bee some that count the bloud of Christ as a common thing,We are to e∣steeme the bloud of Christ most precious vnto vs. and they are such as make sinne common, that commit sinne so ordinarily, that Christ his side must still runne, when they haue com∣mitted any sinne and are washed from that, and come to the Sacrament to seale vp their faith in the bloud of Christ, they commit the same againe, and haue need of his bloud to runne againe, they that thus make no accompt of sin, they make no accompt of the precious bloud of Christ, and let them know it is a step to that fearfull sinne spoken of Heb. 10.29. of treading vnder foot the Sonne of God, and counting the bloud of the Testament as an vnholy thing. And let vs remember one thing further, that if we hold the bloud of Christ precious vnto vs, then wee ought to haue a serious and continued meditation of it, yea, often∣times a solemn remembrance of it, by receiuing the Sacra∣ment of the body and bloud of Christ, the Iewes were to eat vnleauened bread seauen dayes together, and shall we thinke that a short and perfunctory remembrance of the body & bloud of Christ only for fashion at Easter or once in a yeare enough for a Christian man or woman?Exod. 12.15. no, car∣ry another care with thee, or else bee assured it will bee easier for a Iew then for thee at the day of iudgement. Now to the the third thing affirmed of Christ, setting out the dignity of his person as he is God and man, (that
he is the first borne of the dead, &c) the forme of speech first borne as I shewed vers. 15. is Metaphoricall,Interpreta∣tion. Christ called the first borne of the dead in two respects. the Apostle thus speakes by way of resemblance to the first borne in the olde testament. Now Christ is called the first borne with a reference (to the dead) in a double respect. First because he was the first that did rise from the dead, to life eternall, though wee reade that Lazarus and many  more rose from the dead before Christ, yet they rose to liue a mortall life, and to dye againe, but Christ was the first that rose to liue for euer and neuer to dye againe Rom. 6.9. Secondly by vertue of his resurrection, he is the cause of  the resurrection of all his members, as the first borne a∣mong the Iewes, did communicate his good things to his brethren, so Christ the first borne among many brethren, Rom. 8.29. doth communicate the power of his resurre∣ction to his brethren: hence he is said to be the first fruits of them that slept, that as the first fruits among the Iewes offred to God were not only sanctified themselues,1. Cor. 15.20. but did also sanctifie the rest of their crop, so Christ rising from the dead hath not onely made holy his owne resurrection, but sanctified all the faithfull to an happy and ioyfull resurre∣ction. Some may say the wicked also shall rise from the dead by the power of Christ.Ob. It is true indeed;  but not by the benefite and vertue of his resurrection, which is euer sauing, sweet, comfortable, and belongs onely to his members, but by his power as he is God,Gen. 2.17. and a iudge by vertue and necessity of that sancti∣on added to that commandement Quo die comederis: in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death; for that decree comprehends not onely death temporall, but eternall; therefore the wicked must needs rise to con∣demnation, that their bodies may bee punished with their soules, yet by the power of Christ as he is God, and not by vertue of his resurrection; hee by vertue of his resurrecti∣on
is the cause of the resurrection of his members onely, this then is the meaning of the Apostle, that Christ was the first that did rise from the dead to life eternall, and by vertue of his resurrection, he is the cause of the resurrecti∣on of all his members. Now heere we are to obserue, that the Apostle saith not, Christ is the first that did rise from the dead, but that hee is the first borne of the dead, which forme of speech doth  giue vs this instruction, that the earth, the sea or any other place that now holds any of the bodies of the Saints de∣parted shall not hold them for euer;the places that now hold the bo∣dies of the Saints depar∣ted shall not hold them for euer. it is but as the wombe of a fruitfull mother, as the earth brought foorth the body of Christ the first borne; so in the time that the Lord hath appointed, euen at the consummation of all things it shall bring forth the bodies of the Saints, as a mother doth her child of whom she trauells in due season, the bodies of the Saints buried in the dust or in any other place shall be yeel∣ded vp, and shall rise againe at the time the Lord hath ap∣pointed, we find that the holy Ghost vseth this manner of speaking comparing the resurrection to a birth or bringing forth in many places of Scripture: wee haue it in the same words that here are vsed, that Christ is the first begotten of the dead,Reuel. 1.5. & Paul in his Sermon to the people of Antioch, doth apply that of the Psalmist. Thou art my son, this day haue I begotten thee;Acts 13. properly spoken of the eternal generatiō of Christ, as he is God, to his resurrection; & bring it to proue his resurrection: God (saith he verse. 33.) hath fulfilled his promise to vs in that he raised vp Iesus, euen as it is written in the second Psalm,Psalm. 2.7. thou art my son, this day haue I begotten thee Luk. 20, 36. the Saints raised from the dead are called the children of the resurrection: those and the like places, doe plainely proue the point deliuered that the earth, the sea, or any other place shall one day, euen at the day of iudgement bring forth or as the Prophet speakes, cast out the dead as we haue it in vision,Isay. 26.19. Reu. 20.13. the sea gaue vp her dead which were in her, and death and hell deliuered vp the
dead which were in them. Reasons of this are many, it is grounded on the truth  of the word of God, wherein reward is promised to the good and godly, and punishment threatned to the wicked and vngodly. Vpon the iustice of God which euer goes hand in hand  with his truth; that whatsoeuer is spoken in his word, the equity of his iustice doth require the accomplish∣ment of it. Vpon his mercy promised in the couenant of  grace, wherein hee couenanteth with his children to bee their God for euer. Vpon his almighty power, all these are  as so many pillars bearing vp this truth, that the dead bo∣dies of the Saints shall one day rise againe, and be brought out of the earth, sea, or any other place, as out of the womb of a fruitfull mother.  A matter (for the vse of it) of excee∣ding great comfort, yea the very complement and full end of all the sweet and comfortable promises of God, made to his children,That the dead shall rise again is a ground of great comfort to Gods chil∣dren. this was that which held vp Iobs heart in the middest of his affliction, Iob 19.25. I am sure that my redeemer liueth &c. Now then, that euery one of vs may haue profit and sound comfort by this doctrine of the re∣surrection, so comfortable in it selfe, we must not content our selues with the bare and general knowledge of it, some there be that make knowne by their liues, their wilfull and affected ignorance, or rather deniall of this in the generall, and shew that they hold the position of the sensuall Epi∣cure; let vs eat and drinke, for to morrow we shall die, and there is an end of all.1 Cor. 15.32. But as many of vs as are better affe∣cted, and hold it an Article of our faith, must not content our selues to hold the truth of that Article of the resurre∣ction of the body, but we must labor to be assured that we our selues shall haue a ioifull resurrection,Wee must la∣bour to be as∣sured of our resurrection. and bee raised vp at the last day by vertue of the resurrection of Christ Iesus the first borne of the dead, how is that to bee done may some say? The holy Ghost hath taught. Reuel. 20.6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection, for
on such the second death hath no power: but they shal be the Priests of God, and of Christ, and shall raigne with him, there is a double resurrection, not of the body as Chi∣liasts, or Millenaries dreamed the bodies of all both good and bad shall rise at once, there shall bee but one resurrecti∣on of the body, but there is a first resurrection before the last and generall resurrection, in the time of this life, and that is in the soule, when the soule is raised from the death of sin to the life of righteousnesse,Note. and they that wil be par∣takers of the second with comfort, must haue their part in this first; for the truth is, both the first and the second, a it is comfortable, are proper fruits and effects of the resurre∣ction of Christ: Christ by his rising from the dead put a∣way his naturall life, which hee receued with our nature from Adam without sin, and he tooke to him a spiritual life as the Apostle saith in general,1. Cor. 15.44. the body is sowne a naturall body, and is raised a spirituall body, and so Christ the head being raised vp and quickned with spirituall life, it is not possible that he should suffer any of his members to re∣maine in the death of sinne, there must needs be a simili∣tude betweene Christ and his members; let no man then please himselfe with a bare knowledge or generall faith in the article of the resurrection: if any will finde true com∣fort in his knowledge of the comfortable doctrine of the resurrection, he must fetch his comfort from this ground, that he knowes Christ and the vertue of his resurrection,Phil. 3.10. as the Apostle saith, that hee hath an experimentall knowledge, a knowledge and an experience of the pow∣er of Christ his resurrection, raising him vp from the death of sinne to newnesse of life, whosoeuer bindes not his comfort, gathered from the article of the resurrection vp∣on this ground deceiues himselfe, it is but as an hun∣grie man dreames, as the Prophet speakes, Isai. 29 8. He dreames hee eateth, and when he awaketh, his soule is empty: or like a thirsty man dreameth, and lo, hee is drinking, and when he awaketh, behold he is faint, and his
soule longeth. So hee that falsely conceiues comforte from the doctrine of the resurrection, when the time of refreshing shall come, Acts 3.19. at the day of refre∣shing shall finde his soule empty of all true comfort, yea I dare bee bolde to tell him, that the preaching of the worde, his profession of faith, especially of this article of the resurrection, shall not bee as the Apostle doth inferre vpon the deniall of it, 1. Cor. 15.14. an idle emp∣ty and vaine thing that followeth, if there were no resur∣rection at all, but there being a resurrection and hee houl∣ding and confessing a resurrection of the body and there∣by falsly concluding comfort: the preaching of the worde his owne profession,Note. and his houlding of that article as a trueth shall stand vp in iudgement and pleade against him at the day of iudgement, and for conclusion of this I may truely inferre it by the rule of contraries. If on him that hath his part in the first resurrection, the se∣cond death hath no power; then ouer him that hath not his part in it, it shall haue power, the torments of Hell shall bee powerfull and preuaile ouer his body and soule for euer. Come we to another thing offered from these words, & that is this: wee are to marke that Christ is heere said to stand in relation to the dead, as their first borne brother, he is not onely the first borne of many brethren as they are liuing, but the first borne of them as they are dead, whence it followeth that euen the dead bodies of belee∣uers,  wheresoeuer they be, whether in the earth, in the sea,The dead bo∣dies of true beleeuers are still the mem∣bers of Christ or in any other place, are still the members of Christ, and are still knitte to Christ, and for further light to this point marke what the Apostle saith 1. Thess 4 14. that beleeuers departed, sleepe in Iesus, and Rom. 14 8 whe∣ther we liue or die we are still the Lords, the reasons of this  are two. First, there is an inseparable and perpetuall vnion be∣tweene  Christ and euery true beleeuer, not onely in re∣gard
of Soule but of body, 1. Cor. 6.15. know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ: thy body once knit to Christ so continues for euer. Secondly, because of Gods euerlasting couenant of grace, made with his children that he will be their God for euer, is not made onely in regard of their soules, but of their bodies also, euen of the whole man, when God saith I am the God of Abraham, the meaning is not that hee is God of Abrahams soule onely, but also of his body, there∣fore the bodies of beleeuers, although they bee dead and rotten, yet they are still within the couenant and members of Christ. Some may obiect against this, that our Sauiour saith, God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. God is not the God of the dead in the sence and mea∣ning of the Sadduces (that is) so dead as neuer to rise a∣gaine, for they denied the resurrection, but hee is the God of Abraham beeing dead in body to bee raised vp againe, for hee is a God of mercy and of life it selfe, and therefore will in time restore the dead bodies of his Saints to life againe, and that is the meaning of our Sauiour in that place. Wee see then the point prooued. For vse  of it, it is a point of excellent comfort; let euery true beleeuer treasure it vp in the closet of a good heart as a precious Iewell.Consolation to euery true beleeuer. Are the dead bodies of beleeuers within the couenant? is God euen when they are dead still their God according to the couenant? is hee a friend vnto them not onely in life but after death, euen to their dead bodies, that their infernall enemies shall neuer hurt them? though they bee turned to dust and consumed, yet doth his hand still hold and keepe them, in time to restore them? of them let the comfort of this bee mingled with faith in euery one of our hearts, and wee shall finde it will stand by vs, and comfort vs, when wee are gasping for
breath on our death beds, and arme vs against the feare of death, and the horrour of the graue, marke (I beseech you) how Dauid comforted himselfe, when hee saw no∣thing but present death before him, 1. Sam. 30.6. Dauid comforted himselfe, saith the text, in the Lord his God, marke the words, they are full of waight, together with the apprehension of death, as he thought ineuitable, hee did apprehend the mercy of the Lord in the couenant, that euen in death, hee was still his mercifull God, and that death could not seuer him from his God: so if the truth now deliuered, bee setled in our hearts (that euen the deade bodies of beleeuers are within the couenant) it will likewise minister matter of sweet comfort in the verie pangs of death, wee being fully perswaded with the Apo∣stle, Rom. 8.38. that not death it selfe can separate vs from the loue of God, which is Iesus Christ our Lord. Why then should wee feare the stroake of death, or the horror of the graue. Last of all, obserue with me heere against a foolish cauill of the Papists, that the Apostle cals Saints departed dead men, the Papists take exception against vs,Confutation of a Popish cauill. that wee call Saints departed dead men, when we disprooue inuocation of Saints departed, and they say, wee disdainfully call the triumphant Saints in heauen dead men, as if they had no credit with God, nor any care or compassion of men; they may heere see we speake no otherwise then the holy Ghost hath taught vs, calling them dead men, not in disdaine (as they charge vs) but as the holy Ghost doth, as for their cre∣dit with God, and care of men, wee doubt not of it, but yet wee deny them to bee Mediatours betweene God and vs, that is dishonorable to the perfect mediation of Christ Iesus. Now to the end of these three things affirmed of Christ, and the end of them is in the last words. (That in all things hee might haue the preeminence) by the worde preeminence wee are to vnderstand, Lordship, Rule and Dominion
and for the extent and largenesse of Christ his rule and dominion here spoken of,Interpre∣tation. it is said to be in all things, these wordes are diuersly expounded, but the exposition most consonant to the concext, and consenting with other places of Scripture, I take to bee this, that Christ hath rule and dominion ouer all reasonable creatures both quicke and dead, and for this, wee haue warrant from a Paralell, and like place, Rom 14 9. where the Apostle saith, that Christ therefore died, and rose againe reuiued, that hee might bee Lord both of the dead and quicke: that place may serue as a fit commentary and exposition of these words. Yet heere a scruple and doubt may happily arise, some may say, was not Christ Lord of quicke and dead before his death, he is God equall to his Father, and absolute and soueraigne Lod of all, from all eternity? As he is God, and according to his diuine nature, he is a Lord ouer vs before his death, because we were all made by him, and whatsoeuer we haue, we haue from him; but as he is man, he obtained dominion ouer quick and dead, by his death and resurrection; as Saint Peter saith in his sermon Act. 2 36. that after his resurrection, God made him Lord and Christ, because as man, he receiued domi∣nion and Lordship from the Father, which he had not be∣fore, and in this respect Christ himselfe saith, Mat. 28.18. All power is now giuen vnto mee in heauen and in earth, and that is the meaning of the Apostle,Rom. 13.9. when hee saith, Christ therefore died, and rose againe, and reuiued that hee might be Lord both of the dead and quicke. And so the words in this place are thus to bee conceiued, that o∣uer  all both quicke and dead, he might haue Lordship and dominion. From the words thus vnderstood obserue we in a word, that it is a prerogatiue of Christ Iesus, to be Lord of quicke and dead.It is a prero∣gatiue of Christ Iesus to be Lord of quicke and dead. How then can the Papists defend their Popes supereminent power, that fulnesse of power they say the
Pope hath ouer the soules of men departed (as they say) in purgatorie, to reclaime, or to loose them from thence at his pleasure, and to open o shut heauen to whom he will, not to say any thing of the error of the place, it beeing but a fable, how can they maintaine that power of their Pope, without incroaching vppon the prerogatiue royall of Christ Iesus, who is soueraigne Lord of quicke and dead,  who hath the keies of hell and death, Reuel. 1.18.Confutation of the Popes supereminent power. They alledge that hee doth it by vertue of his commission, by power committed vnto him, as Christ his Deputy and spi∣rituall Magistrate, but that is as full of doubt as the former, and a taking of that for granted, which cannot bee proo∣ued: they must first proue the Pope receiued such power (which they cannot) before thence they conclude, that which they inferre vpon it, or else they build on the sand: let it suffice onely to haue pointed at this; That which we are to marke, as a ground of more profitable instructi∣on, is this: the Apostle saith not, Christ is the head, &c. that he might be Lord ouer all both quicke and dead, but that he might haue preeminence ouer them: whence ari∣seth this conclusion. That Christ is then Lord ouer all, when in all hee hath preheminence: or more specially  thus, then is Christ our Lord,Thē is Christ our Lord when he hath preeminence ouer vs. when hee is not onely known by that title, but when he hath preeminence ouer vs, when his power ruling vs, (namely) the power of his spirit and grace is more eminent, and doth shew it selfe a∣boue any other power, either within or without vs, when his power of grace hath preheminence, and preuailes ouer the inward strength of our corruption, and ouer any out∣ward power drawing vs to sinne; then is Christ our Lord, for as we know in ciuil matters, he is not a Soueraigne and chiefe Gouernour, who hath any ouerruling and higher power aboue him. So Christ is not our Soueraigne Lord, if any other power ruling in vs, bee aboue or equall to his. himselfe hath taught vs, that he is then our Lord, when he ouerrules the strength that doth stand in opposiō against
him, Luke 11.22. Wheresoeuer he rules, he is stronger then the strong man armed, holding possession, he comes vpon him and ouercommeth him: hee taketh from him all his armour wherein hee trusted, and deuideth the spoiles. Hence it is that in the Epistle of Iude verse the fourth, hee is said to bee Lord and Master, or Ruler, for so the words are in the originall, which denie that onely Ruler, who is God, and our Lord Iesus Christ, these two are put together to signifie that where Christ is a Lord, he is a ruling Lord, he hath soueraignty and preeminence: I neede not further to stand to prooue the point, but yet for more speciall direction, some may happily desire, to bee enformed, how they shall know when the grace of Christ hath preeminence,  and is more eminent then their corruption, or any other thing, for heerein many are de∣luded and deceiue themselues, thinking that the grace of Christ hath preeminence, and is predominant in them, when they haue onely that grace, which is common to them, with meere naturall men, I meane power restrai∣ning them from grosse sinnes, seruing onely to leaue with∣out excuse.  ) For our direction therefore in this case, we are to know that then the grace of Christ hath preeminence in v, when it is powerfull not onely to restraine from euill, and to order the outward conuersation to some tempora∣rie conformity to the word of God, but when it is power∣full in good things, and in good actions, especially of the immediate worship and seruice of God, and that in a dou∣ble respect. First, making vs to doe good things willingly, cheerful∣ly, and not of constraint, as wee are compeld by Law, ei∣ther of God or man, but euen so, as if there were no Law to compell vs, for the preaching of the Gospell ministreth the spirit, saith the Apostle, Galat. 3.5. and the spirit of Christ, makes the people of God, a free and a voluntary people, seruing God not of constraint, but willingly, Psal. 110.3. The Psalmist saith, thy people shall come willingly
at the time of assembling thine army in holy beauty. Secondly, making vs doe good things in sincere obedi∣ence to the commandement of God, and to the glory of Christ Iesus, that the glorious name of Christ may bee magnified in vs, and by vs in all good duties, Phil. 1.20. this was Pauls hearty desire: As I heartily looke for and hope that in nothing I shall bee ashamed, but that with all confidence, as alwayes, so now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. By these two things found in vs,Triall of our selues, whe∣ther Christ be our Lord or no. we may know that the grace of Christ hath preeminence in vs, and let vs heereby try and examine our owne selues, whether indeed Christ be our Lord as we professe or no, wee hold it an Article of our faith, that we beleeue in Iesus Christ our Lord: now if Christ be our Lord, not in title onely, but in truth, then hath he preeminence, hee preuailes by his grace ouer the inward corruptions of our hearts, I leaue the examination to euery mans conscience, yet we must know, that this is a duty incumbent and lying vpon vs, that as wee professe Christ our Lord, so wee ought to finde the grace of Christ powerfull in vs, and that this is not a thing arbitratory in different and left to vs at pleasure, but a matter of neces∣sity, consider we these things. First, the Apostle hath sayd, 2. Cor. 4.3. if the Gospell bee hid, it is hid to them that are lost, so certainely much more, if Christ the matter and substance of the Gospell be hid, if he doe not appeare, and shew himselfe predominant and powerfull by his grace in our hearts, it is more then a probable argument of perdition. Againe to professe Christ our Lord, and not to finde his grace powerfull in vs, is made by the Apostle, the knit∣ting vp of many great sinnes in one bundle. 2. Tim. 3.5. the Apostle hauing spoken of many grosse sinnes, he shuts vp all in this, that they haue a shew of godlinesse, but haue denied the power thereof. To pretend Christ to be our Lord, and not to finde his grace powerfull ouer the cor∣ruption
of our hearts, it containes the guiltinesse of many sins, yea at the day of iudgment it will adde waight to the guiltinesse of other sinnes, for then a professour of Christ being found an adulterer or a drunkard shall bee challen∣ged and condemned not onely for his whooredome or drunkennesse, but for the abuse of his profession, his coun∣terfet profession of religion, his profession of Christ a Lord, yet weak and without power to ouermaster his cor∣ruption shall aggrauate and adde waight to the burden of his sinne, and presse him downe to deeper condemna∣tion. If then wee would not seale it vp to our selues that wee are such as are appointed to euerlasting perdition, and if we would not cloth our other sinnes (odious enough in themselues) with more guiltines, and make them stand with more foule and vgly faces in the sight of God, his Angels and Saints at the day of iudgment, then let vs learn it to be a matter of necessity, that as wee professe Christ our Lord, so we are to find his grace powerful ouer vs, ma∣king vs cheerfull in all good duties, and to good things in sincere obedience to the commandements of God, and so as the glorious name of Christ may be magnified. Obserue one thing further, the Apostles doctrine of our vnion with Christ and of receiuing life from him it ends in this, that Christ might haue the preeminence, whence it followeth, in our profession of the Gospell, touching iustification,  sanctification, resurrection and all things pertaining to life and saluation,In our profes∣sion of all things to come from Christ tou∣ching life and saluation wee are to seek no∣thing lesse thē our own glo∣rie. to come from Christ, we ought to seeke no∣thing lesse, then our owne glory, in the doctrine of the Gospell all things end in the honour and glory of Christ, that he might haue the preeminence in all things. And againe the Gospell sets forth vnto vs heauenly and eternall things, not deserued by vs but giuen of the meere grace and goodnes of God, therfore in professing the Gos∣pell we are not to seeke our owne glory, and let euery true beleeuer make this vse of it, when any gift or grace of
Christ in him is magnified, let him returne the glory to to the right owner Christ Iesus:  if thou be praised for any gift grace or good worke,Wee are to yeeld to Christ the glory of euery gift and grace that in vs. know it is not thou that art prai∣sed for any gift grace or good worke, but Christ in thee to whom all honour and praise is due, hee is the head the be∣ginning the author and the worker of all good gifts, ther∣fore in euery good thing commended in thee, must he haue the preeminence: it is an incroaching vpon his right to take any part of the glory to thy selfe. VER. 19. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulnesse dwell. The words of this verse as they haue reference to that which is immediately premised are a proofe of Christ his preeminence in all things, but they may more fitly be con∣ceaued as standing in relation to the Apostles general pro∣position laid downe in many verses. That saluation comes vnto vs from God the Father by his Sonne Iesus Christ. And then they containe a Second reason to prooue Christ his sufficiency to redeeme vs and the argument is from the eternall decree and good pleasure of his Father, that he had so decreed, that Christ should be a sufficient redeemer which is propounded vnder the matter of his sufficiency (namely) all fulnesse dwelling in him, that it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulnesse dwell and therefore he is a sufficient redeemer, and this is the connexion & general scope of the Apostle in these words. We find the sentence in the originall thus laid downe, for it pleased that in him the word (father) is not expressed, but yet that word which is heere rendred (pleased) being the same word that is vsed by the Euangelist Mat. 3.17.Interpreta∣tion. to sig∣nifie and reueale the good pleasure of the Father, it may well be referred to the eternall decree of God the Father,
and the sentence thus made vppe (it pleased the Father) that is to say it was the decree and good pleasure of the fa∣ther, from all eternity (all fulnesse) by fulnesse we are to vn∣derstand the fulnesse of the Godhead spoken of chap. 2.9. because that is not really communicated to vs, but certen finite and created effects of it, and the Apostle heer speaks of such fulnesse as dwelling in Christ, the head is commu∣nicated to his members, neither that fulnesse spoken of Ephes, 1.23. for by that is meant the Church: but the ful∣nesse of grace and merit according to that Iohn. 1.14.16. verses: the worde was made flesh, &c. and (of his fulnesse haue all we receiued grace for grace, &c) the Apostle here proues the sufficiency of the work of redemption wrought by Christ, and that by the sufficiency and perfection of merit to life eternall: Thus then we are to vnderstand the words, that it was the good pleasure of God the Father, that in Christ should dwell all fulnesse and perfection of grace and merit to life eternall. Now heere much might bee spoken of the necessity of Gods eternall decree, which is the force of the Apostles ar∣gument, that the Father decreed it in his eternall councell, that Christ should be a perfect redeemer, and therefore it must needs come to passe, and likewise heere wee might speake of the contingent and necessary comming to passe of things of the necessity of coaction and infallibility, but I passe by these things. The first thing we are to marke is, that it pleased God to  apppoint the fulnesse that should be in his owne sonne, for he gaue not his spirit to him by measure Iohn 3.34.The Lord hath appoin∣ted euery mans mea∣sure of gifts that he would in time be∣stow vpon him. Wee may inferre vpon it a generall conclusion that the Lorde hath appointed euery mans measure of gifts, that hee will in time bestow vpon him of whatsoeuer, whether inward or outward, for his will appointing and disposing of all other things, it may not bee excluded from the appoint∣ment and disposition of the measure of gifts hee vouchsa∣feth to euery one; to insist in one particular in stead of ma∣ny
the Lord hath appointed euery mans measure of foode and rayment and therefore Agur, Prou. 30 8. prayed that the Lord would feed him with food conuenient or, as the wordes are to bee vnderstood with bread of his allowance statute and appointment, with that bread which God in councel had allowed and appointed for him, where by the way, we see warrant for that maner of praier which is with condition, with reference and regard of Gods secret will and appointment, that wee may lawfully and indeede that we ought (though some think the contrary) to ask tempo∣rary good things with condition of Gods will, if it may stand with the good will of God that he would grant them vnto vs: (but that by the way.) Now for the vse  of this that euery man hath his portion of gifts at the Lords appointment,Euery one must bee con∣tent with his own measure of good things vouchsafed vnto him. let euery man hence learn to be contented with his measure be it neuer so small for why? it is appointed of the Lord, and he in his wisdom knoweth what is meet & necessary for euery one, and if we be not content with our measure vouchsefed, wee take vp∣on vs to prescribe to the Lord, & wee determine of things needfull for vs by a leaden rule euen our owne blinde er∣ring & deceiuing iudgement which is not able to discerne what is fit & necessary. I might vrge this by many reasons,Two doubts moued and answered. but I speak of it in the beginning of this chapter, only now I wil ad the solution & answering of 2. doubts and questi∣ons that may be occasioned from the duty deliuered. First it may be demaunded seeing wee are to be content with that portion God hath cut out for vs in his eternall decree for the supplying of our wants,1. Doubt. whether it be lawfull to pray against pouerty, sicknes, aduersities, & wants or no, it may seem we are rather to pray for S. Pauls gift.Phil 4 11.12. Answ. First the proper place of contentation is after the vse of the meanes (namely) labour,  prayer and therefore praier against pouerty, sicknes, aduersities and wants, doth not crosse contentation, they may well stand together, a∣gain we must know that we are not to pray against pouer∣tie,
sicknesse, aduersities and wants simply, but for the dan∣ger of sinning which they bring men oftentimes vnto, which manner of prayer respecting the occasionall danger that attends many times on pouerty, sicknesse, aduersities and wants through our corruption, argues no discontent∣ment with the portion allotted vnto vs, and so may lawful∣ly be vsed, we may pray against pouerty, sicknes, aduersi∣ties and wants not simply, but to the ende wee may better glorifie God, expressing or at least including alwaies a con∣dition of Gods good pleasure, and to this effect that we be neuer tried aboue that we are able, wee may obserue this in that prayer of Agur, Pro. 30.8.9. Giue mee not pouertie nor riches: feed mee with foode conuenient for me: verse 9. lest I be full and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord, or lest I be poore and steale, and take the name of my God in vaine. 2. Questions or Doubts.The second question is this, whether such as get a porti∣on of goods by theft, vsury, oppression, or any other means condemned, may find contentment in those goods, & say with comfort, it hath pleased God to bestow such a porti∣on of wealth vpon me? Answer no, the guiltines of their owne conscience doth set a ba between them and true contentment & comfort. The Lord hath appointed they should haue such riches? It is true, the euent reueales it, but as curses vnto them, not as blessings, and for further increase of their iudgment when the meanes of getting goods are euill, it is reuealed that the Lord doth purpose to curse men, euen in good things, and that is an heauy curse, and a thing if it were du∣ly considered, that is able to shake the heart of any vsurper or greedy cormorant out of his security, and to this pur∣pose the Apostle saith; goe to now ye rich men, weepe and houle, for your miseries that shall come vpon you, a hea∣uy sentence full of terror, weeping, and howling are part of hellish discord. The next thing we are to marke is, that the fulnes of grace, & merit, is confined to the persō of Christ,
and that by the eternall decree of God, (it pleased God the Father, that in the person of Christ should al fulnes dwell,  we finde it not sayd in any place of Scripture,Fulnesse of grace is onely found in the person of Christ. that fulnes of grace should or did dwell in any Saint whatsoeuer. The Papists are not able to warrant that they affirme of the vir∣gine Mary, that shee was full of grace, though they would faine ground it on the salutation of the Angell, Luk. 1.28. for so they translate, Haile Mary full of grace,Note. but falsely and corruptly, and that may appear by the vse of the same word, Ephes. 1.6. & that by their owne translation, wher∣in he hath gratified vs &c. say they in that place. And the iudgement of Chrysostome is cleane against them, and that with a very good reason, , &c. he saith not grace, which he hath giuen vs, but  whereby hee hath made vs freely beloued, which is agreeable to our translation, Luk. 1.28 thou that art freely beloued. So then notwithstanding this coloured cauill it remaines a true conclusion, that the fulnesse and perfection of grace is not, nor hath beene found in any one in this life, but in the person of Christ. What a hellish pride therefore is it of some to be blowen vp so high as they dreame of perfecti∣on, of inherent grace in themselues in the time of this life. I hope theres none amongst vs of that opinion, and  therefore the vse of this may be vnto vs rather for comfort then reproofe, and may teach vs first of all,Finding in our selues but small begin∣nings of grace truly wrought we are not to bee discou∣raged. that we are not to be discouraged, though we finde in our selues but small beginnings of grace, if it be true grace, for the Lord giues grace vnto vs, according to the manner of our receiuing, as the infirmity of our nature is able to receiue it, which is not capable of perfection, it is like a glasse with a narrow mouth, and of small capacity and receipt, and the instru∣ment of receiuing which is faith is weake and feeble, and the Lord (as here we are taught) hath in his eternall coun∣cell designed fulnesse and perfection of grace in this life, onely to the person of Christ. There wee may comfort
our selues if any of vs finde but a small measure of grace truely wrought in vs, Mat. 13.33. the Kingdome of hea∣uen, saith our Sauiour, is like leauen hid in three peckes of meale, and Gods Kingdome is set vp in the heart, vpon very small beginnings, the very beginning of grace is comfortable, if it be true grace. How shall wee know (will some say) that we haue true beginnings of grace? I answer, holding to the comparison of our Sauiour, if grace be in vs as leauen hid in meale, which is penetrans & diffusiuum, peircing and of a spreading nature, if a pro∣portionable measure of grace be found in euery faculty of our soules, not onely illumination in the minde, but a mea∣sure of Sanctification in the will, affections and in all the powers of our soules for sanctifying grace cannot be truly wrought in one part or faculty of the soule, but it will dif∣fuse and spread it selfe ouer all the rest, hence is renation of Gods image in man called a new creation, which is entire of the whole man, if grace be thus proportionable in euery faculty of the soule, then it is truely wrought, and then though it be but small in measure, yet it will afford vs mat∣ter of singular comfort. And know wee on the contrary that if we haue our heads abounding & ouerflowing with knowledge, and yet our hearts empty of good affections, grace is not truely wrought in vs, and in time of tempta∣tion and triall it will failes vs, and wee shall finde no com∣fort in it. For the second vse is it so, that fulnesse of grace is onely found in the person of Christ,We must hun∣ger and thirst after righte∣ousnesse. Mat. 5.6. then wee must learne that lesson that hath a blessing set on the head of it, by Christ himselfe, and a comfortable promise annexed, blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse for they shall be satisfied, we are in this life to be in continuall hun∣ger & thirst after grace, neuer to finde our selues full, & as it were glutted and purged with any grace, but euer to finde an emptinesse and such a want of that grace, that is
truely wrought in vs, as doth require further supply and filling vppe, and that wee may bee content to breake through any danger, to attaine to a greater and more full measure of the same, as wee say in our common Prouerbe, Hunger will breake stone walles, it will force a man to doe things aboue strength; yea, wee finde it recorded in stories (as 2 King. 6.19.) it hath made some of the tendrest bowels and most affectionate in regard of Sexe, euen women to forget naturall affection, such an impatient and holy feeling must wee haue of the want of a full measure of grace, and such an hungring desire to bee further filled with grace that is already wrought in vs, and to that ende wee are to vse all good meanes of further increase of it, hearing, reading, conferring, and continuall meditating in the word of God, prayer, &c. and to vse them with earnest intention of heart and minde, wee can witnesse with our selues, that when wee haue beene hungry wee haue vsed meanes of fil∣ling our bellies, and of satisfying our hunger with our best endeauour: so must wee with all earnest endeauour vse the meanes of further filling our hearts with that grace that is begunne in vs; many there bee who hap∣pily renounce the error of supposed perfection, and they will confesse that to bee an errour, yet notwithstanding they feele not their owne emptinesse and want of grace, as they ought, they haue a soothing and pleasing con∣tentment,Note. they haue as they imagine a competent and sufficient measure of grace: for example, of faith, they be∣leeuing the remission of their sinnes through the bloud of Christ, though that faith neuer shew it selfe, by any loue or zeale to the glory of God, or any earnest care of the good of their brethren, they thinke they haue a  of faith; yea, some out of their blindenesse and out of their presumption dare say, their faith is so strong that the deuil cannot hurt them; such persons cannot haue any hun∣gring and longing desire after further increase of faith,
they thinke it matters not, whether they profit, and bee further built vp in faith by the vse of the meanes or no. I referre such persons but to that one place, Luk. 6.25. where they finde a woe denounced against them, and that out of the mouth of Christ himselfe, woe be to you that are full, what? full of faith and grace? No, that is farre from the meaning of Christ, he knew well there is no such fulnesse to bee found, but woe to you that in your owne conceit are full, to you that imagine a fulnesse of grace, and thinke that you need not care for any further encrease, to you be∣longs a woe and a heauy iudgement; if then we would not come within compasse of this woe denounced by him who cannot lye, nor be deceiued, let vs take heed how wee fancy to our selues such a ful and perfect measure of faith, as admits no further increase by the vse of good meanes;Note. I grant there may bee a , a full assurance of faith, respectu obiecti, in respect of the obiect (namely) the good∣nesse, truth, and power of God, but not respectu subiecti, as it is in vs, in regard of our corruption. Where wee finde full assurance spoken of in the Scripture, wee may obserue it hath relation to the obiect of faith, as Rom. 4.21. wee are not therfore to dreame of a full and perfect faith in vs, but let vs labour to find our weakenesse and want of faith, and euery other grace truely wrought in vs, and hunger and thirst after a further measure of it, and vse the meanes by which it may bee increased,Confutation of the papists. (all fulnesse) I might heere enter into a confutation of that grosse error of the Papists that Christ hath merited but the first grace for vs, that is as they hold, he hath merited that we heereafter by our me∣rits may take away our owne sinnes, yea the sinnes of o∣thers,  a wicked and damnable assertion, the right concei∣uing of this text,All fulnesse of merit hath re∣sidence in Christ as in the proper subiect of it. is a sufficient confutation of it, for in Christ (as heere we are taught) is found all fulnesse of me∣rite. The last thing we are briefely to obserue from this verse is from the last word (dwell) which word doth giue vs to
vnderstand, thus much, that in Christ all fulnesse of merit, hath residence and abode, as in the proper seat and subiect, as in the proper mansion and receptacle, the merit of life eternall is properly inherent in Christ,  and the reason is plaine, hee is God and man in one person, therefore hee onely is the proper subiect of merit, for that person that must merit, must be more then a meere man, if Adam had stood in his innocency, hee could not haue merited any better estate for himselfe, because hee was a meere man, much lesse can we in the state of corruption; the ground of merit euen in Christ is the personall vnion. So then for the vse  of this, the merit of life eternal is not ours by infusion and inherency, but by application and imputation it is not in vs as is sanctification,Merit of life eternall is not ours by infu∣sion or inhe∣rency but by application & imputation. Luk. 20.35. and as is the loue of God and man, but it is applied and imputed vnto vs, and freely bestowed vppon true beleeuers in Christ; it is not (as one saith well) any dignity in vs but a dignation of vs, an accepting & accompting vs worthy in Christ, we haue the very phrase, they that shall be compted woorthy &c. the Papists the defenders of inherent worthinesse, and merit of works. Obiect that 2. Pet. 1.4.  that true beleeuers are partakers of the diuine nature, and that doth raise vp their workes to an higher dignity, and addes a woorth of heauen vnto them. For Answer, we are to marke the text,  the Apostle saith not  of the God-head or the nature of God, which is essentiall and incommunicable, but  of the di∣uine nature, which is nothing else but a quality created contrary to our old corrupt nature, euen the image of God renued, as the Apostle sayth, in that ye flye the corruption which is in the world through lust. They cannot thence prooue that we are deified, or one with God by personall vnion, which they must, before they can euince from thence any merit of our workes. True beleeuers are par∣takers of the diuine nature, (that is they haue the spirit of
God dwelling in them by the graces of righteousnesse and holinesse which is the image of God, and those graces be∣ing not perfect in vs bring forth an imperfect fruit which can neuer merit truely and properly. VER. 20. And by him to reconcile all things vnto him∣selfe, and to set at peace through the bloud of his Crosse both the things in earth and the things in heauen. This verse is a further amplification of the Apostles se∣cond argument, whereby he proues Christ a sufficient re∣deemer, and the ground of this also is from the eternall de∣cree of his Father, for that must be resumed (it pleased the Father) (by him to reconcile) the matter, substance and generall proposition laid downe in this verse, is this. That it pleased the Father, that the death of Christ in whom all fulnesse of merit is found, should bee a full and perfect attonement and reconciliation of all things to himselfe. This is generally propounded in the first words, and by him &c. and then it is further explaned with some change and variety of phrase, and withall there is mention made of the special meanes of reconciliation (namely) the death of Christ, and that his bloudy death vpon the crosse in those words (and to set at peace by the bloud of his crosse. In the last words we haue a distinction of all things recon∣ciled in respect of place, that some be in earth and some be in heauen (both the things in earth and the things in hea∣uen.) These are the generall parts of this verse. Come we to the first thing the generall proposition (& by him) to reconcile all things vnto himselfe,Interpreta∣tion. by him, that is, by Christ, not as an instrument as the Papists say, Christ is but a minister yet a chiefe minister of reconciliation, for so they would bleare the eies of such as read their annota∣tions in their Rhemist testament: we are not so to vnder∣stand the words of the Apostle, but by him as a materiall
and meritorious cause of reconciliation as the Apostle saith, 2. Corin. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe, not imputing their sinnes vnto them, (to reconcile) that is to set at one and to make of enemies friends as the Apostle saith, Rom. 5.10. When wee were enemies we were reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne taking away the cause of enmity and difference, (namely) sin, for so long as that remained vntaken away, no friendship could be betweene God and man, and ther∣fore we haue it in the place before named 2. Corin. 15.16. not imputing their sinnes vnto them (all things) (that is) all things in heauen and earth that he had appointed to be reconciled (to himselfe) these words haue reference to the word Father in the verse before. Thus then we are to con∣ceiue these words, it pleased the Father by Christ not as an instrument but as the meritorious cause to make al that he had appointed to be reconciled euen at one and at peace with himselfe, remouing al cause of enmity between them and himselfe. Heere first we are to marke the connexion of this verse  with the former,Our reconci∣liation with God is euer grounded on fulnesse of merit. that the Apostle coupleth & conioyneth these two together that it pleased the Father. That in him should all fulnesse dwell, and by him being full of merit to reconcile all things vnto himselfe, whence it followes that our reconciliation with God, is euer grounded on the ful∣nesse of merit: fulnesse of merit in naturall order euer goes before reconciliation with God as the ground of it, and the reason is this, reconciliation with God is an agreement and an attonement made betweene God and vs, by taking away sinne the cause of difference, now sinne is not taken away without full satisfaction made vnto God and hee is not satisfied but by fulnesse of merit answering his iustice, euen such merit as is able both to appease his wrath, and procure his louing fauour, for no imperfect thing can satis∣fie the iustice of God, therefore fulnesse of merit euer goes before reconciliation with God.
For vse  of this, as it is in the naturall order of these things that fulnesse of merit goes before reconciliation with God,We must ap∣prehend ful∣nes of merit before we can be perswaded of reconcilia∣tion with God. so is it in the comfortable apprehension of them that are reconciled to God, wee must first apprehend by Faith the fulnesse of merit, before we can be perswaded of our reconciliation with God, the conscience of man will neuer be truly quieted and pacified touching reconciliati∣on with God till hee come to apprehend by faithfulnesse of merit in Christ, though a sanctified life and good works, doe make our calling and election sure 2. Pet. 1.10. and it is the obiection of the Papists that our confidence in God touching the fauour of God, ariseth not onely of Faith, but of good works, and for this they alleadge 1. Ioh, 3.21. if our heart condemne vs not, then haue we boldnes towards God, yet wee must know that a sanctified life and good works giue no assurance of themselues by their own merit or worthinesse (as the Papists teach) but as they haue relation to Faith, whereof they are euident signes, and as they haue their life and actiuity from Faith, for mark, that place of Peter, giue diligence, saith hee, to make your calling and election sure, in doing these things; but what? doe these things done simply of themselues make sure our calling and election, no, no such matter, but as they are ioyned & knit vnto faith, so saith the Apostle, verse 5, ioyne to your faith vertue,2. Pet. 1.5.6.7. and with vertue knowledge, &c. so then good works of themselues, breed no assurance of Gods fauour, but as they are ioyned with faith, and doe issue out from Faith,Rom. 5.1. it is the plaine doctrine of S. Paul that being iustifi∣ed through faith, we haue peace toward God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, peace and confidence towards God, touching his fauour and our reconciliation with him ari∣seth from iustification by Faith, and that hath euer relation to the perfect merit of the obedience and death of Christ, to the fulnesse of merit found in him, I may heere be bold to relate as fitting to this purpose a worthy obseruation of Luther, I haue seene (saith hee) many among the Papists,
who haue painefully trauelled and vpon meere conscience haue done as much as was possible for them in fasting, praier, and other exercises, and all to this ende that they might obtaine quietnes and peace of conscience, notwith∣standing the more they trauelled, the more they were stric∣ken downe with feare, and especially when the houre of death approached, they were then (saith hee) so fearefull that I haue seene many murtherers, and other malefactors condemned to death, at the time of execution dying more couragiously, and more comfortably then they did. This Luther obserued in his time, and there is reason for it from the word of God, for it is impossible that the conscience should euer bee pacified concerning reconciliation with God by any good thing found in vs, no, not by faith it selfe for the goodnesse of it, or done by vs by the merit of it, but onely by faith apprehending the fulnesse of merit, and that found onely in Christ. The next thing we haue to marke, is to be gathered from  the word (reconcile) that word giues to consider of a fore∣going enmity and disagreement,There is en∣mity and dis∣agreement between God and vs, till we be reconciled vnto him. for reconciliation is euer (as we know) of parties at difference in regard of offence. So then hence wee are taught; that before we are reconci∣led to God by Christ there is enmity and disagreement betweene God and vs, hee is an enemy vnto vs and we are enemies to him; the Scripture is plentifull in the proofe of this, we need goe no further then the verse following,Col. 1.21. you which were in times past strangers and enemies, in time be∣fore your reconciliation with God, there was enmity be∣tweene God and you. Let the vse  of this be,We are to la∣bor for speedy reconciliation with God. to teach vs to labour for timely and speedy reconciliation with God by his sonne Iesus Christ, I meane, for actuall reconciliation, for though such as be∣long to Gods election, are in Gods purpose, and material∣ly by the death of Christ reconciled to God, yet that is not comfortable till it be knowne to vs, we must labour for a∣ctual reconciliation with God by a iustifying faith, and for
assurance of it by the spirit of God to stirre vs vp to this du∣ty, consider this, is God our enemy? who then can be our friend; as the Apostle saith on the contrary, if God bee with vs, who can be against vs, Rom. 8.31. so if hee bee a∣gainst vs, who can be for vs, if God who should comfort vs in time of trouble and distresse be angry with vs, then our trouble and distresse is doubled vpon vs, it is is both gree∣uous and paineful vnto vs, and it is mingled with bitternes of the curse, it is an accursed trouble; in a word, if God be offended with vs, and wee not actually reconciled vnto him, all the creatures are at enmity with vs, all the iudge∣ments of God attend vs, yea we are liable, not only to com∣mon miseries, but to strange and sudden iudgements, as we see some vnrepentant sinners suddenly ouertaken by the hand of God many times in their greatest delights, e∣uen in the Sun-shine, Sodome was destroied, and so it may be with vs for any thing we know;Gen. 19.23.24. therfore this exhortati∣on is needfull, that with speed we labour to be reconciled to God, it was not for nothing that the Apostle did so ear∣nestly enforce it. Now we then, as Ambassadors for Christ, we pray you, yea God by vs, and Christ himselfe doth in∣treat you,2 Cor. 5.20. that you would not contemne his grace, cast off his merits, and lightly regard his death, wee pray you in Christs stead, that ye be reconciled to God. I doubt not vpon due consideration of this truth, euery one will confesse it a thing needfull to bee reconciled to God, yet there bee many things to hinder the practise of this so necessary a duty, and one great hinderance of it, I will discouer, and that is the want of feeling our owne mi∣serie in which wee are by nature,Note. many blesse themselues in their naturall state, and feele no want of the bloud of Christ for reconciliation with God, they feele not them∣selues disioined from God, both in regard of holinesse and happinesse, and that there is in their whole man, both body and soule, an horrible confusion, their vnderstan∣ding full of palpable darkenesse, their will peruerse, abhor∣ring
that is good, their affections raging and inordinate, and if they should die in that state, that they should enter into that vnspeakable misery, that hath no end but shall continue for euer in hell, this many feele not, and so ne∣uer seeke after reconciliation with God, and to bee free from this misery, wee must therefore looke into the word of God, that discouers our misery, and labour to haue a liuely sence and feeling of it,The first step to blessednes. for that is the first steppe to blessednesse, to know and feele our owne misery, & know for a truth, that we can neuer with true comfort applie the sweet promises of the Gospell touching remission of sins, till wee haue a true feeling of our owne misery, it is the order Christ himselfe hath taught to bee held in our comming to him with hope of comfort. Mat. 11.28. Come to me you that labour, you that feele your sinnes and are pressed with the waight and burden of them, and you shall finde ease, none but you. We are futher to marke that the Apostle sayth, it plea∣sed  the Father to reconcile all things vnto himselfe,Euery sin is a∣gainst God. hence wee may gather, that euery sinne is against God, euery sinne reacheth vp to heauen, and is an offence against God himselfe, reconciliation heere spoken of being an agree∣ment betweene God and sinnefull man, it must needs be that euery sinne is against God to whom reconciliation is made, we read Psal. 51.4. that Dauid in the confession of of his adultery doth auouch it with repetition & doubling against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned, and the Lord himselfe sayth, Gen. 20.6. that he kept Abimelech from adultery, and in that from sinning against himselfe, I kept thee that thou shouldest not sinne, not against Abra∣ham, but against me. Reasons of this are these, euery sinne is a transgression  of Gods Law, 1. Ioh. 3.4. and so offensiue to the Law gi∣uer God himselfe. Ob. The Law hath two Tables,Obiection. 1. Ioh. 3.4. the first concerning loue to God, and the second concerning loue to man,
therefore it may seeme the breach and transgression of the commandements of the first Table, is onely against God. The breach and transgression of any commandement of the first table is directly and immediately against God, but not onely the breach and transgression of a comman∣dement of the second table, as it is a transgression is also a∣gainst God, for euery euill word spoken or deed done a∣gainst man hath a double relation, either to God as a trans∣gression of his Law, or to man in the hurt arising by it vnto man, as a transgression, it is a sin, and so against God, and there is such an agreement and combination between the two tables that as the first is fulfilled in the second, for by duties of loue to our brethren we testifie our loue to God, so the transgression of the second, doth redound to the first, and so is also against God. Secondly, euery sinne is against him that hath absolute and full power to remit it,Ioh 43.25. Mat. 9.5, and that is onely God, by the testimony of the Scribes, and therefore euery sinne is a∣gainst God. If any oppose against this, that in the petition, forgiue vs our debts, as we forgiue our debters? The Answer is, we doe remit the trespasses of our bre∣thren, not as they are properly sinnes and transgressions, for so the remission of them belongs only to the Lord, and no man is able to doe it, but as they bring detriment and hurt to man, either in body or goods or good name, so man may remit without impeachment or derogation to Gods glory, a man doth remit a trespasse, when hee doth forgiue the hurt arising from thence to himselfe, together with all conceiued anger and malice, but the remission of any trespasse as it is a sinne properly and onely belongs to God, it is therefore a true conclusion, that euery sinne though it bee an euill against man, is not so much against the person of the man vpon earth, as against the Maiesty of God in Heauen.
This truth meets with that erroneous mincing and ex∣tenuating  distinction of sinne, made by the Papists,Confutation of a Popish distinction. that some sinnes are veniall, and some mortall; yea, veniall of their owne nature, euen such as are onely besides and not against the Law of God, and may stand with true iu∣stice and deserue not eternall death, but are taken away by some temporary punishment, this extenuation of sinne cannot stand with the doctrine now deliuered, for if euery sinne be against God who is infinite in Maiesty and Glory, it must needes deserue infinite punishment, the greatnesse of euery offence against any person in the common-wealth is euer measured and esteemed according to the dignity and quality of the person against whom it is committed, so sinne being against God, the due deserued punishment of it, of necessity must be answerable to the offence of so high a Maiesty, there being euer a proportion betweene the Law-giuer, the Law it selfe, and the punishment due to offendours, it is therefore to bee renounced as a shifting vaine distinction inuented by the Papists to obscure the great grace of God in the remission of sins; that some sins are of their owne nature veniall. For a second vse; is it so that euery sin reacheth to hea∣uen;  and is an offence against God;We are to take notice of the enormity and greatnes of euery sin. hence take we know∣ledge of the enormity and greatnes of euery sin, though it be a sin against the second table, though it be an euill word or deede against man, to the hurt of his body, goods or good name, yet wee must know it stayeth not at the man, but reacheth vp to the Lord, and he it is that will be auen∣ged of it, euery man can take notice of the grosse sinnes of the second Table, yea, many hold them the onely great sinnes (which indeed they are not) though they bee very foule. But if they wrong their brethren either secretly or in small matters, then they out of their blindnesse of mind thinke it is either no sinne at all, or a trifling sinne, if they can blinde the eyes of men all is well, but know it whosoe∣uer thou art, though thou mayst deceiue man and bleare
his eyes with a thousand deuices, yet thy sinne is against God, and thou canst not blinde his eyes, no gifts, no bribes, no cunning, can stop or stay him, as he is God, he will haue vengeance for his part, 1. Sam. 2.25. sayth old Ely, if one man sin against another, the Iudge as Mediator may moderate and order the matter, and by his autho∣rity cause him that hath done the wrong, (as it is a wrong to man) to make recompence and satisfaction, but as it is a sinne against the Lord who will plead for him? surely, none but Iesus Christ the righteous. Come wee to the explanation of the Apostles generall proposition in the wordes following (And to set at peace) where we see a change of the phrase,Interpreta∣tion. and expressing of the speciall meane of reconciliation. To set at peace, is all one in substance with the former phrase, to reconcile, and so to be conceiued (namely) to set at one to make of enemies friends; (Through the bloud) (that is) through his bloudy death, it is a metonimicall speech, bloud being put for the shedding of his bloud, and it is added (of his bloud) to sig∣nifie the condition of his death, which was accursed, and to make a difference betweene that shedding of his bloud, and the shedding of it at othertimes, as at the time of his circumcision, whipping, crowning with thornes, which were preparatiues to the shedding of his bloud on the crosse, thus then the words are to be vnderstood, and to set at one to make of enemies friends, through his death, and that his bloudy and accursed death on the crosse. The first thing wee haue hence to marke is generall, (namely) this,Reconciliati∣on betweene God and his chosen, is made only by the bloudy death of Christ. Heb. 7.26. that reconciliation and peace made between God and his Elect, by taking away sinne is onely by the bloudy death of Christ, by Christ his sacrifice on the crosse, the Apostle heere sets it downe as the proper fruit and effect of Christ his death, and wee finde it not in any place of Scripture ascribed to any other thing, but onely to the death of Christ, and for this wee haue many preg∣nant places, now in the end of the world, hath he appeared
once to put away sinne, by the sacrifice of himselfe, Heb. 10.14. with one offeringe hath hee consecrated for euer them that are sanctified; our Sauiour sayth, consummatum est, it is finished,Iohn. 19.30. heereby signifying the consummation & perfection of his crosse. The poynt being cleere it serues for the vse  of it, to con∣fute the PapistsConfutation of the Papists touching their reall and externall sacrifice, which they hold to bee in the Sacrament of the supper e∣uen the very body and bloud of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, offered vp to God the Father as a propi∣tiatory sacrifice for the quicke and dead, that is their doct∣rine, now these two things cannot stand together, that re∣conciliation and peace was made by the death of Christ betweene God and his chosen, & that there is another pro∣pitiatory sacrifice in the Sacrament, and that wee may yet further see the errour of the Papists and be better settled in the truth taught by our Church grounded on the word of God, consider wee but this one reason, Christ his sacrifice once offered vpon the crosse, is a most perfect and full sa∣tisfaction for the sins of Gods Elect and is of infinite end eternall vertue and efficacy, and therefore other reall sacri∣fices are needlesse and superfluous. The learned amongst the Papists reply,  that the sacrifice of the crosse is (indeed) of infinite and eternall vertue to satisfie and sanctifie, but yet say they there must bee other sacrifices to represent and apply the vertue and fruit of that sacrifice vnto vs. There is no more reason why Christ should againe be sa∣crificed,  that his owne perfect oblation once offered vppon the crosse, might be applyed vnto vs, then there is that hee should be againe incarnate, that the fruit of his incarnation might be applied vnto vs, for they can shewe no dissimili∣tude betweene these things. They reply further by way of distinction, that whereas the holy Ghost sayeth,  wee are sanctified by that oblati∣on of Christ his body once offered vppon the crosse, he
speakes of the bloudy sacrifice which was sufficient once to be done: but besides that, there is an vnbloudy sacrifice, whereby Christ is offered vnder the formes of bread and wine in the Sacrament, and that is but an iteration of the former, whereby the fruit and effect of the former is appli∣ed vnto vs. This distinction is flat contrary to the plaine text of the Apostle,  Hebr: 10.11.12. for if Christ should bee often sa∣crificed, after what manner soeuer it skilles not, then the difference would not hold which the holy ghost makes between the sacrifices of the Law, and the sacrifice of Christ for thus stands the opposition. The sacrifices of the law were often to be offered, but the sacrifice of Christ only once. The Priests of the law had many iteratiue & cōme∣moratiue sacrifices of Christ his death, therefore we haue not so now: this is the opposition of the holy ghost, and this falles to the ground, if there be any iteration of Christ his sacrifice; againe, the distinction is absurd and foolish, that Christ should offer himselfe vppon the crosse after a bloudy manner, and in the Sacrament after an vnbloudy manner, for the sacrifice and offering of Christ & his death and suffering, which cannot be without effusion of bloud, are made by the holy ghost all one, Christ cannot be offe∣red without dying and suffering,Heb: 9.25.27. therfore this distinction was neuer knowne to the holy ghost, neither hath it any footing in the word: it remaines a truth, that Christ his sa∣crifice once offered vpon the crosse, is most absolute, and of infinite merit and vertue to reconcile vs vnto God, and therefore other reall sacrifices whether represen∣tatiue (as they call them) or vnbloudy whatsoeuer, are needlesse and vaine, and there is not in the Sacrament of the Supper, any reall externall propitiatorie sacrifice, as the Papists grossely hold and teach. The next thing wee haue to marke is this, in that the Apostle makes the speciall meanes of reconciliation betweene God and his chosen by taking away of their
their sinnes, both the guilt and punishment to be the death and passion of Christ, that it pleased the Father to recon∣cile, &c. Wee may hence conclude, that our iustification in the  sight of God, is not onely by the death of Christ:Our iustifica∣tion in the sight of God, is not only by the death of Christ. the thing by which we are iustified in the sight of God, is not the pas∣sion of Christ alone, though that is one speciall thing by which we are iustified; for by that, as many as truely be∣leeue in Christ, haue onely remission of their sinnes, which is but one part of our iustification in the sight of God; in common reason wee know that reconciliation amongst men is made, when the party offending hath satisfied the party offended, either by himselfe or some other, for the offence, be it really, or in words onely, reconciliation pro∣perly goes no further; the party offending, doth not by satisfaction for the offence deserue further fauour, vnlesse there be somthing else ouer and beside that satisfaction; so is it in this case, the chosen of God being the parties offen∣ding; God being the party offended by their sin, & satisfa∣ction being made to his iustice by the death of Christ, that death alone considered, doth not procure any more than remission of their sins, & deliuerance from al punishment: it doth not also purchase a right to life euerlasting, and so our iustification in the sight of God, is not by the death of Christ alone, but also by the obedience of his life,Some hold that our iusti∣fication in the sight of God, is only by the death of Christ. Reas ns con∣firming the truth of the Doctrine. our com∣pleat and full iustification in the sight of God is by the o∣bedience of Christ as well actiue as passiue; it is held by some, that our iustification in the sight of God is onely by the death of Christ, and that the passion, is the onely thing by which we are iustified in Gods sight. I will therefore labour first to strengthen the truth now deliuered, by some reasons out of the word of god, & then answer such things as are commonly obiected against it. First therefore consider we this reason: Christ is not onely the price of redemption, but the end and per∣fection of the Law: to what purpose? for righteousnesse
vnto euery one that beleeueth, they are the very words of the Apostle, Romanes 10.4. Christ perfectly fulfilled the Law for righteousnesse vnto euery one that beleeueth. Therefore euery true beleeuer is iustified in Gods sight, not onely by his death and passion, but by his righteous∣nesse imputed. Secondly, we finde these two things, righteousnes, and redemption, to be seuerall and distinct benefits bestowed on true beleeuers, but ye are of him in Christ Iesus, who of God is made vnto vs, wisedome, and righteousnesse, and sanctification, and redemption. Therefore by the death of Christ,1 Cor. 1.30. the price of redemption, we haue only deliuerance from sin and deserued death, and not the gift of righteous∣nesse, to life eternall, they are distinct benefits. Thirdly, whole Christ is giuen vnto vs with all his be∣nefits,  for hee was incarnate, and borne not for himselfe, but for vs, Isay 9.6. vnto vs a child is borne, and vnto vs a sonne is giuen, that hee might bestow himselfe wholy on vs as a Mediatour, and all the workes of mediation, as (namely) his holy incarnation, his fulfilling of the Law, and his suffering for sin, therfore we by faith are made par∣takers of the righteousnesse of Christ, as well as of the me∣rit of his death: if it were not so, then it would follow that halfe Christ, Christ onely suffering, and not working, were giuen vnto vs. Fourthly, the Apostle saith, Romanes 5.19. As by one  mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by one mans obedience many shall bee made righteous; where hee compares Adam and Christ together, that as many as were made sinners by Adams sinne imputed vnto them, so many are made righteous by the obedience of Christ imputed. If any except against this, and say, the Apostle there meanes Christ his obedience in submitting himselfe wil∣lingly to the death, in which it was his Fathers will, hee should suffer for his chosen.
I answere,  that the Apostle speaks not only of Christ his obedience to death, but generally of his whole course of righteousnesse both in his life and death, and that is eui∣dent in that hee calls it the gift of righteousnesse, vers. 17. an the reigning of grace by righteousnesse through Iesus Christ, vers. 21. These reasons do plainly euince this truth, that true beleeuers are iustified in the sight of God, not on∣ly by Christ his death, but also by his actiue obedience, & his perfect fulfilling of the law for them being imputed vnto them. Now against this it is commonly obiected,  that Christ fulfilled the Law for himselfe, and therefore his death a∣lone, is that by which we are iustified in the sight of God. Christ as man fulfilled the Law for himselfe, that hee  might be an holy high priest in both natures,  but as medi∣ator God and man, hee did not, neither was bound to ful∣fill it for himselfe, for in that his flesh was personally vni∣ted to his Godhead, it was in it selfe fully sanctified, and from his very conception in the wombe of his mother, most worthy to be blessed with eternall life, and had right to eternall life, as the flesh of the sonne of God, but yet Christ of his owne accord became subiect and fulfilled the law for vs. It is said againe, wee read that by the bloud of Iesus we  haue entrance, wee haue ius ingrediendi in Sancta,Hebr. 10.19. nempe coe∣lum, (that is) right to eternall life by the bloud of Christ, Rom. 5.9. we are iustified by his bloud, and we shall bee sa∣ued from wrath by him. There is such neerenesse and affinitie betweene the pas∣sion of Christ and his actiue obedience,  that the one may not bee seuered from the other. For Christ in suffering o∣beyed, and in obeying suffered. When therefore the ho∣ly Ghost saith, that by the bloud of Christ we are iustified, wee are to vnderstand it as a figuratiue speech, where one part of the obedience of Christ is set downe for the whole. Thus we finde iustification ascribed to the resurrection of
Christ Rom. 4.25. which indeed doth only iustifie by way of testimonie and application, and not by satisfaction, as doth the obedience of his life and death. Some doe further obiect on this manner, say they, such as truly beleeue in Christ are freed by Christ from the guil∣tinesse and punishment of their sins, and are in & through him adopted to be the children of God, & by their adop∣tion haue right and title to heauen, yea they are coheires with Christ, Rom. 8.17. and therefore are iustified only by Christ his death and passiue obedience. To this I answer, that iustification hath euer adoption annexed vnto it, and such as are iustified by Christ, are also adopted, and haue receiued power to be actually accoun∣ted the children of God by Christ, but we must know that our adoption comes from the obedience of the son of God made man, & from his voluntary subiection to the Law, & his fulfilling of it, the text is plain, Galat. 4.4.5. God sent foorth his sonne made of a woman and made vnder the Law, not borne but made, that hee might redeeme them which were vnder the Law, that wee might receiue the adoption of the sonnes. The obedience of the Sonne of God made man, and made vnder the Law, is that which freeth true beleeuers from vnder the law, and giues them adoption of sons. Christ as the naturall son of God, is heire of his Fa∣thers kingdome: true beleeuers as the adopted sonnes be∣come partakers of the same inheritance. Christ his media∣tion performes to them the grace of adoption, and his me∣diation is his holy incarnation, his fulfilling of the Law, and his suffering for sinne, and therefore still it remaines a truth, that we are iustified in Gods sight, not by the death of Christ alone, but also by his actiue obedience. Rom. 4.5. Obiect.Some obiect that faith is accounted or imputed for righ∣teousnesse, and no other righteousnesse required to our iustification in Gods sight, but faith, and therfore the righ∣teousnesse of Christ is not imputed vnto vs, to our iustifi∣cation.
I answer,  nothing indeed is required on the true belee∣uers part but faith, nothing else on his part is necessary to his iustification in Gods sight by the couenant of grace but Faith, yet that Faith must be considered together with the obiect of it (namely) that which it takes hold of, and that is the righteousnesse of God, as the Apostle calls it, 2. Cor, 5.21. and that is the perfect righteousnesse of Christ; which hath all the power and merit of it from his godhead, and is therefore called the righteousnesse of God,Phil. 3.9. and so is Faith counted for righteousnesse, because it takes hould on that which is our righteousnesse in the sight of God, euen the perfect righteousnesse of Christ: other obiections there be but these are the chiefe, and these beeing answered let vs hold it as a truth grounded on the word of God,We are to hold the truth of the doctrin deliuered. that our iustification in the sight of God is not onely by the death and passion of Christ, but also by his perfect actiue obedi∣ence imputed vnto vs, before we come to the last wordes of this verse obserue one thing further, the Apostle saith not through the wood of his crosse, but through the bloud of his crosse, power to reconcile, pacifie, satisfie and sancti∣fie, is not giuen to the wood of the crosse, but to Christ his painefull suffering on the crosse.Popish super∣stition touch∣ing the woo∣den crosse of Christ, disco∣uered to bee most grosse. The papists ascribe much to the woodden materiall crosse of Christ, that it being the instrument of redemption and the Altar on which Christ was offered, it is sanctified and truely called holy crosse, whereas indeed the Scripture neuer calls it holy but rather cursed for the Apostle proues that Christ became accursed for vs in that he suffered on the crosse, and that by testimo∣ny taken out of the olde testament, it is written, cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree: yet the Papists will needes force holinesse vpon the woodden crosse,Gal. 3.13. yea they put confidence in it, and pray vnto it, holy crosse saue vs: thus grossely superstitious are they, it is sufficient to haue na∣med this among such as renounce and abhorre such po∣pish grosse and carnall superstition. Come we to the last words (both the things in earth, and
the things in heauen) these words are a distinction of things reconciled to God, by things in earth we are to vnderstand onely the chosen of God liuing in the world:Interpreta∣tion. 1. Tim. 5.21. Obiect. by things in heauen, the holy and elect Angels as they are called. Haue the elect Angells who neuer sinned neede of Christ a mediatour? this seemes contrary to all shew of truth, for reconciliation is a setting at one, by taking away sinne. Angells had need of Christ a mediator, not of redemp∣tion from sinne, for so Christ is onely the mediatour be∣tweene God and man, but of conseruation in goodnesse and grace,1. Tim. 2.5. that they might by the grace of Christ be con∣firmed and set out of danger of defection and falling from God, and that they might againe be knit together with the elect vnder one and the same head Christ Iesus, as the Apostle saith, Eph. 1.10. that he might gather together in one all things, both which are in heauen, and which are in earth in Christ. In these respects the holy Angels had need of a mediator. Now that which we haue hence to marke, is this, that it pleased the Lord together with the reconciliation of his chosen to himselfe, to worke the confirmation of his elect Angels in grace & goodnes, knitting them inseparably to himselfe, he would not perfect the blessednesse of his holy  Angels, without the blessednesse of his chosen amongst men:Gods chosen children are right deare to the Lord. he might haue confirmed them long before, but hee would not, it was not his pleasure to giue them that bles∣sing, till Iesus Christ the mediator came and ioyned them with man. Heere then we are taught to see & consider the infinite and vnspeakeable loue of God to his chosen, that his chosen children are right deere to the Lord,Heb. 11.39.40 and of ex∣ceding great price with the Lord. We shall find it the argu∣ment of the holy Ghost himselfe, to prooue that the Lord had a fatherly, prouident, and speciall regard of his church vnder the new Testament, that the Saints that suffered in time of the old Testament got not the thing promised, be∣cause
God had respect to vs: God prouiding that they without vs should not be perfected. Where the argument stands thus; That the Lord had a fatherly care ouer vs, because they were not made perfect without vs, and so it doth plainely manifest and euince the Lords wonderfull loue, and his gratious regard of his chosen, that he would not giue his holy Angels their full blessing of their con∣firmation in grace, without the blessing of the reconcilia∣tion of his chosen, and that this loue of the Lord towards his chosen, may bee yet more cleare vnto vs, consider that the chosen children of God, are so esteemed of the Lord, that for their sakes hee doth many times extend his boun∣ty, and bestow temporarie benefits vpon the wicked, if ten of them had been found in Sodome, the whole Citie had beene spared for their sakes. The world doth hate, malice,Gen. 18. mocke and contemne the godly, making more accompt of one prophane Esau, than of twenty true hearted Iacobs, but the Lord whose loue is life it selfe, more esteemeth one Iacob, one faithful seruant of his, then ten thousand world∣lings; yea ten of them shall stand before him to turne him from anger to mercy, when hee will not vouchsafe to re∣spect ten thousand such as the world honoureth for men and women of great accompt. Oh then let vs euer seeke and sue to bee within com∣passe  of the Lords loue, rather than the worlds liking,We are to seek and sue to be within com∣passe of Gods loue. and say with the Prophet Dauid, Psalme 4.6. Many say who will shew vs any good? but Lord, lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. Againe, are the chosen of God of such high esteeme and price with the Lorde, that with∣out them hee would not perfect the blessed estate of his holy Angels, and by them and for them hee extends his  goodnesse to the wicked?Such as feare God, bring much good to the place where they liue. Then let vs haue our eies ope∣ned to behold whether good or euill doe come to a land, to a city, or to an house by such as feare God, for the sake of tenne such, the Sodomites had escaped the fearefull plague of fire and brimstone, and for Noahs sake, was
Cham preserued. Paul had all the soules giuen him that were in the same ship, Act. 27.24. are these then the hurts of a place, and must bee rooted out, or else we shall not bee well. Oh then learne to see their price with God, and the profit and good that come euen to the wicked, by such men and women as feare the Lord, learne to esteeme of them as we ought; let vs not be like the Gadarenes Mar. 5. to prefer our sin before Christ, and wish any one fearing God to be gone, rather then part with a trifling profit, learn I say, to thinke on the price with God, and profit to men, of such as feare the Lord. Ver. 21.22.VER. 21. And you which were in times past strangers and enemies, because your mindes were set in euill workes, hath he now also reconciled. 22. In the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and vnblameable, and without fault in his sight. In these words the Apostle applies that which hee hath generally said of reconciliation in ver. 20. to the Colossi∣ans in speciall, affirming that they in particular, were re∣conciled to God by the death of Christ, that is the propo∣sition laid downe in these two verses. Now this proposition is amplified by a description of the Colossians, what they were before their reconciliation, (namely) strangers and enemies, and you which were in times past strangers & enemies: together with the proper seat and subiect of that enmity (namely) their minds, and that not in the essence and substance of their mindes, but in the qua∣litie of them, that their mindes were set in euill workes ill affected. The second amplification of the proposition is in the verse 22. from the ende of their reconciliation in these wordes, to make you holy and vnblameable, and that before him, in his owne sight, these are the generall parts of these two verses.
I will first stand on that part of the Apostles proposition that is laid downe in the vers. 21. together with the de∣scription of the Colossians, before their calling and con∣uersion: you which were strangers,Interpreta∣tion. that word is metaphori∣call, and is put to signifie a spirituall separation and aliena∣tion from God. That the Colossians before their conuer∣sion, were as strangers vnto God, in respect of spirituall communion, that they had as it were nothing to doe with God, nor he with them, in regard of any spirituall blessing and comfort promised to his children, so doth the Apo∣stle expresse it in the state of the Ephesians, cap. 2.12. that they were aliants from the common wealth of Israel, and were strangers from the couenants of promise, and had no hope, and were without God in the world; and makes it further cleare by opposition, ver. 19. that to be strangers is to haue no fellowship with him, either publique or priuat, enemies, that is, such as did hate God, and were hated of God for sinne. How can it be that any should hate God the chiefe good yea, goodnesse it selfe? The wicked hate God, not simply as he is God,  and the chiefe good, but as he is a Iudge and a seuere punisher of sinne, and as the guilty malefactor doth hate the Iudge, not as he is a man, good, liberall, &c. but as he is a iust sen∣tencer of his euill deeds, (saith he) thar is, God the Father, (reconciled) that is, actually and effectually, by communi∣cating vnto you the vertue of the death of his Son. Thus then the words are to bee conceiued: And euen you Co∣lossians, who in times past were estranged from God, in regard of spirituall communion, yea, were such as hated God, and were hated of God, hath God the Father now actually and effectually reconciled. The first thing that wee haue heere to marke, is, that the Apostle doth not content himselfe to deliuer the generall doctrin of reconciliation between God and his chosen, but he doth in particular apply it to the Colossians, and saith,
euen you hath he reconciled. Generall do∣ctrines must be applied particularly. 1. Tim. 4.2.Hence wee may gather, that generall doctrines taught out of the word, must bee particularly applied to the hea∣rers for their comfort or reproofe, or to profitable vse for their edification, we finde it the Apostles charge to Timo∣thie, not onely in generall to preach the word, to open and publish the secrets of the Gospell, but to bee instant in im∣proouing, rebuking and exhorting, with all long suffering and doctrine, Tit. 2.15. these things speake, and not onely so,  but exhort and rebuke with all authoritie; the reason & ground of this is twofold. First, because the Lord hath ordeined the preaching of his worde, not onely for the edification of the vnderstan∣ding, and for the information of the iudgement and bette∣ring in knowledge: but for the reformation of the heart and life, that the heart also may be stirred vp to a loue of God and an hatred of euill, & that especially, bicause in all diuine and holy exercises, the heart and affections, both by naturall corruption and Satans suggestion are most way∣ward and vnruly; it is an easie matter to bring the body, and not so hard to attend & to conceiue the doctrine deli∣uered, but to bring into captiuitie euery thought to the o∣bedience of Christ, as the Apostle speakes, 2. Cor. 10.5. that is a matter of great hardnesse and difficulty, and ther∣fore the truth must not onely be taught in generall, but it must also be applied in particular, that the power of it may be felt to a thorow reformation. Againe, some of the hearers of the word are in their na∣turall blindnesse and hardnesse, some are possessed with a spirit of slumber fast asleepe in their carnall securitie, others shroud themselues vnder hypocrisie, and therefore they must be dealt withall, no onely with plains and euidence of truth, but with powerfull application of that truth, and earnest importunity; that the ignorant may be informed, the sencelesse and secure may be rowsed, and the hypocri∣ticall made to see their sin.
Is it so that generall doctrine must be particularly appli∣ed  to some profitable vse, surely,Hearers of the word must suffer in∣struction and reproofe as iust occasion is offered to the teacher. then the hearers must suffer both teaching, instruction, and also reprehension, and correction as occasion is offered to the teacher, they must not start aside when the word is opened and applied to their iust reproofe, shewing them their sinnes, or threa∣ning iudgements against them for their sinnes, men must heare with willingnesse and patience the word of iust re∣proofe and not quarrell with the affection of the speaker, when they are iustly taxed for their sinnes. If they do, it is not onely an argument of a spirituall phrensie, but of Gods iudgements imminent and ready to fall vpon them when they cannot abide to be touched, but wil haue Prea∣chers speake pleasing and flattering things vnto them, this iniquitie, saith the Prophet Isaiah. 30.13.14. shall be vn∣to them, as a breach that falleth, both suddenly and reme∣dilesse, without all hope of recouery, like the breaking of a potters pot, which is broken without pittie, and in the breaking thereof is not found a sheard to take fire out of the hearts, or to take water out of the pit. And consider wee,Note. that the word truely taught and applied neuer returnes emptie, for if it worke not godly sorrow and amendment, certainely, it workes, hardnesse and impenitency. It is either the sauour of life to life, or the sauour of death to death, and remember withall what Salomon hath said, Prouerb. 28.9. that hee that tur∣neth away his eare from hearing the Lawe, euen his praier shall bee abhominable. Hee that refuseth to heare God speaking in his accusing, condemning and threatninge Law, the Lord in iustice will turne away his eare from his praier, and his praier doth incense the Lord to wrath  aginst him.The Minister of God may apply the pro∣mises of the Gospell to particular beleeuers. Learne wee then to submit our selues to bee taught the truth, and to be rebuked for any thing that is a misse in vs. Secondly is it so, that the word must not onely bee generally taught, but particularly applied, surely,
then the minister of God may lay the indefinite promise of the Gospell to the heart of euery particular man for his comfort, and assure him that he beleeuing them, hee shall be saued. Yea but saith the Papist euery man is a liar, & may both deceiue, and be deceiued, & the minister telling may erre, how doth either the minister know that the man to whom he speakes is of the number of the elect? or how can the man be certaine that the minister mistakes not, when hee doth assure him of his saluation. See how these enemies of the grace of God and of the word of his grace would fame shift off the plaine euidence of the word, to hold the people in suspence and doubt of their saluation. It is not to the purpose, whether the minister know that the man to whom hee speakes be in the number of the elect, the minister doth not, neither is he to assure a∣ny man of his saluation, but vpon condition of beleuing, hee doth onely apply the generall promises of the word to euery man particularly vpon condition of be∣leeuing. After this manner, the Gospell saith, whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued, the application of the minister is this, therefore beleeue thou Iohn or Thomas and thou shalt be saued, and this is in effect, as if Christ himselfe should say vnto him, beleeue thou, and thou shalt be sa∣ued: for to his ministers hee hath committed the worde of reconciliation: 2. Corin. 5.19. and so any man finding true faith in himselfe, (as he may finde it vpon due exami∣nation as the Apostle hath made cleare 2. Cor. 13.5. proue your selues whether ye are in the faith. Examine your selues: know ye not your own selues, how that Iesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?) he may bee assured of his owne saluation. The next thing wee haue to marke is this, the Apostle saith the Colossians were in times past strangers and ene∣mies but now they were reconciled from this difference of
times we may conclude that there is an intercourse & suc∣cessiue change not onely in thinges naturall,Men may be changed in respect of their sp rtuall condition. but also in things spirituall and supernaturall, men may hee changed in respect of their spirituall condition, and of children of wrath by nature, they may bee made the sonnes of God, and heires of life and saluation, a point plainely taught by Gods effectuall vocation and calling of men out of the kingdome of darkenesse into the liberty of Gods children and not onely cleare from this text but by many other places of Scripture Rom. 6.11. ye haue beene seruants of sinne, but ye haue obeied from the heart vnto the forme of the doctrine whereunto ye were deliuered, Ephes. 5.8. yee were once darkenesse, but now are light in the Lord. If a∣ny man be truely called out of the state of nature into the state of grace, he can vpon his owne experience iustifie this truth, that the spirituall condition of men may in time be changed, and the ground of this is, Gods eternall purpose  of sauing some for whom he hath before al times appoin∣ted to life and saluation, them he will in time call & bring home to himselfe Rom. 8, 30. whom he predestinate them also he called, and whom he called them also he iustified, and whom he iustified, them also he glorified. Other sheep I haue, which are not of this fold, them also must I bring saith our Sauiour Iohn. 10.16. This being so that the Lord in time will bring home his wandring sheepe into his sheepfold,  and draw them that are far off neere to himselfe,We must take heede of vn∣timely cen∣sure and rash condeming such as are yet vncalled and vnconuerted. it serues to reprooue the pre∣posterous and rash iudgement of some who are so bold as to step vp into Gods chayre, and to giue their deffinitiue sentence of some wicked & vngodly men & to pronounce them eprobates and vtterly cast away, we must take heede of this boldnesse, and know that we are not to despaire of the finall state of any wicked man, vnlesse his sinne bee a∣gainst the holy Ghost (which we can hardly know and dis∣cerne) for the Lord can and will in his appointed time call him home if he belong to his election. Paul his example
may be in stead of many, how was he estranged from God? and how farre was he carried in fury and bloud thirsty cru∣elty against the Church of God Acts 9.1. it is said, he brea∣thed out threatnings: and his owne confession is, Gal. 1.13. that he persecuted the Church of God extreamely, and wasted it yet afterward it pleased God to call and conuert him, and of a violent bloudy persecutor to make him an excellent and famous preacher, in this example the Lord hath taught vs to expect with patience the conuersion of rebellious sinners, knowinge this, that God can call and conuert when hee will, and whome he will, he calls labou∣rers into his vineyard, some at one houre, and some at ano∣ther, Mat. 20. it is therefore S. Pauls lesson to Timothy, 2. Tim. 2.25. and it must be ours, that wee suffer euill men patiently, that are cureable, in whome there is any hope proueing if God at any time will call them to repentance, and God can and wil in his good time bring home his cho∣sen, be they neuer so farre strayed from him, therefore take heede of vntimely censure and rash condemning any man yet vncalled and vnconuerted. Now in that the Apostle saith that the Lord had nowe actually reconciled the Colossians being sometimes meer  strangers and enimies, wee may further gather, that Gods elect,Gods elect in regard of ele∣ction are bee∣loued of God being yet vn∣called. though for the present they be vncalled, yet euen then in regard of election they are within the compasse of Gods loue. For why? the Lord will in time call them, and actually reconcile them to himselfe as he did the Colossi∣ans and that doth plainely proue his precedent and fore∣going loue towards them, that hee loued them beefore their effectuall calling, euen when they were strangers and enimies: yea the Lord embracing his chosen in Christ  the Apostle saith,Eph. 1.4. beefore the foundation of the wode though they make defection, and be estranged from him, yet he changeth not vpon them, he onely hates their sinne but still loues them. Hence it is that the Apostle saith, that God sets out his loue,Rom. 5.8. makes his loue towardes his elect
knowne, yea he makes it knowne both to them and to all the world, that hee loued them euen, while they were yet sinners, in that he gaue his son Christ to die for them, and S. Ioh. 1. epist. 4.9. saith. In this appeared the loue of God to∣wards vs, because God sent his only begotten sonne into the world, that we might liue through him, his loue was to∣ward his chosen before, and in this was it manifested, that he sent his only begotten son into the world, & euen then whē we loued not him but were yet in our sins he loued vs. The reason and ground of this is from the immutabi∣lity of God, with whom is no variablenes,  neither shadow∣ing by turning, and his loue is essentiall and of the same nature with himselfe,Iames 1.17. and therfore these whom he hath lo∣ued from all eternity and in lou elected and appointed to life and saluation, them he doth imbrace in his loue for euer. It is not their enmity towards him that can make him turne away his loue from them in regard of election, and thus the Apostle reasoneth,Rom. 11.28. that the Iewes as concerning the Gospell were enemies, but as touching the election, they are beloued for their Fathers sakes, for saith he ver. 29. the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. The Lords loue either in gifts or calling is vnchangeable. But will some say, are the elect of God as yet vncalled,Ob. and as yet straungers and enemies within the compasse of Gods loue, then it seemes their persons and workes are pleasing vnto God before their conuersion, and that is a∣greeable to popish doctrine▪ that is a thing they much contend for and stand vpon. For answer to this wee must learne to marke a different dgree of the Lords loue extended towards his chosen,  in it selfe it admits neither more nonlesse, but as it is reached out towards Gods chosen, there bee indifferent degrees of it for they are loued of the Lord before their calling as the elect of God onely knowne to him so to be,Note. and in time to bee called with that degree of loue that is proper to the e∣lect vncalled, but when they are called and iustified, then
they are loued with a further degree of his loue euen to an actuall acceptation of their persons and good works as pleasing vnto him in Christ, they beeing ingrafted into Christ their persons and good workes are actually accep∣ted as pleasing to God in and through Christ, and so it re∣maines a truth that the chosen of God yet vncalled in re∣gard of election are loued of God though not with that degree of his loue, it pleaseth him to vouchsafe to them that are actually called. This may be to euery one that hath had testimony of Gods special loue towards himselfe a ground of exceeding great comfort?  for why? is it so that Gods chosen are loued of God from all eternity,A ground of great comfort to such as haue testimo∣ny of Gods speciall loue towards them are men when they are vncalled within the compasse of that loue of the Lord? then who∣soeuer hath had a true taste and testimony of Gods loue towards him, may bee comforted with full assurance that that loue shall continue for euer, doth the Lord still loue those whom he hath elected though they be as yet estran∣ged from him and doe not know his loue and will hee in time make knowne that loue of his to them in their re∣conciliation to himselfe? And will his loue then euer faile those to whom it hath beene manifested and testified in speciall manner? it is not possible, though the Lorde for the present may seeme to hide his face from thee, yet if euer thou hast had any pledge of his speciall loue towards thy selfe, comfort thy selfe, thou maist be assured his loue will neuer forsake thee, his loue is eternal and neuer chan∣geth, and vpon former experience of it, thou maist reason thus for thy comfort, the Lord hath formerly testified his loue towards mee, therefore he will still continue to loue me, he will be good vnto me, because he hath beene good, and adde one testimony of his loue and mercy to another to his first, a second, to the second a third, and so euer one mercy to another and one measure of loue to an other, this Dauid knew well, and therefore hee intreated the Lord to bee good vnto him, because hee had beene good
Psalm. 4.1. thou hast set mee at liberty when I was in distresse, and therefore still haue pitty vpon mee,Psal. 4.1. and this was the ground of Dauids comfort, and this may stablish thy heart also with comfort, if euer thou hast tasted the sweetnesse of the Lords speciall loue thou maist with cheerfull heart say. O Lord bee good vnto mee not because I haue beene a good seruant of thine, but because thou hast beene a good God of mine. If thine obedience were to be the argument why the Lord should bee good vnto thee then (though thou beest a faithfull seruant of God) yet doubtlesse in conscience of thine owne sinne, thine heart would faile thee, but the argu∣ment is to bee the Lords former goodnesse and loue expressed towards thee, and this is a sure argument that will neuer deceiue thee, the Lord hath beene good, therefore hee will still and euer be good, thou hast had experience of his loue, therefore build vpon it, his loue shall neuer faile thee, let vs meditate and thinke vpon this ground of comfort, in time of need wee shall finde much sweetnes in it. The next thing wee haue to marke as a ground of fur∣ther  instruction is this,A stranger to God is an e∣nemy to God. the Apostle doth couple and con∣ioyne these two together strangers and enemies, hence wee are taught that a stranger to God is an enemy to God they euer go together, it is not betwixt God and man as betwixt man and man, one man may be a stranger to another, yet not an enemy, but if thou be a stranger to God,Mat. 12.30. thou art an enemie to God. Christ himselfe hath taught the trueth of this, he that is not with me is against me, ye he makes it a re∣ciprocall proposition, and true backe againe, for saith hee, Marke 9.40. hee that is not against vs is on our part: whence we may easily conceiue the reason of it why a stranger to God is an enemy to God, because by the testimony of our Sauiour there is no medium between them, no middle con∣dition betweene a stranger to God and an enemy to God, he that hath not communion with God (which in deed) is
to be a stranger vnto him, he hath it with the Deuill, yea luke warme professors such as the holy Ghost saith are nei∣ther hot nor cold Reuel. 3.15. which seeme to hold a mid∣dle condition, in deed and truth rightly considerered in that they are lukewarm they haue fellowship with the de∣uill, and so must needs, so far forth as they are luke-warme be enemies to God, and this ought to teach vs to take heed how we be alwaies estranged from the Lord. Some the holy Ghost hath noted out as great strangers  to the Lord, and such as are gone farre away from him as riotous persons,We must take heed we be not any way estranged from God. Luk. 15.13. drunkards and such like, these (without question) are at open defiance with the Lord, their beha∣uiour shewes it, they bend their tongue like bowes as saith the Prophet Ieremie 9.3. and shoot out their arrowes, bitter and blasphemous words against God. Wee must not onely take heed of this that we become not such strangers as these who are at open warre with the Lord, and can iustly looke for nothing, but that the Lord should deale with them as with his professed enemies, euen come downe in iudgement vpon them, hew them in peeces, and giue them their portion with hypocrites, we must not onely take heede of this great strangenes and open hostility, but beware that thou turne not so much as thy foot from the Lord, keepe thy selfe at home with him, frequent his house and come often to his table where thou maist haue familiar communion with him, for as wee count him a stranger who seldome or neuer comes home vnto vs.Note. So is he a stranger to the Lord who often absents himselfe from his house, & seldom or neuer comes to his table, & in that wilful staying himselfe from the house & table of the Lord he becomes an enemy to God, and takes vp a banner against him, which is little thought on by ma∣ny persons, who ofttimes vpon no occasion absent them∣selues, & seldome, scarce once in a yere or two come to the Lords table, if a man should ask such persons whether they loue God or no, they would scorn the question, but if they
make answer it would be readily this, O yes they loue the Lord, they would be sorry else, but wilt thou vnderstand ô thou vaine man whosoeuer thou art, if thou wilt vnder∣stand and consider it aright, know thou art an enemy to God, whatsoeuer thou saist to the contrary, thou art a stran∣ger vnto him, thou hast not that familiar and comfortable fellowship with God, that his people haue in his house, and the Lord holds thee a stranger, & consequently an enimie vnto him, & without repentance, will iudge & plague thee as one of his enemies, thinke vpon it whosoeuer thou art that hast bin carelesse in frequenting the house and table of the Lord; & remember the words of the holy Ghost him∣selfe, If any withdraw himselfe,Acts 10.38. my soule shall haue no pleasure in him. If any withdraw himselfe from the communion of Saints in the house of God, and so from communion with God himselfe, he withdrawes himselfe from vnder the speciall prouidence of God, he is not vnder the speciall tui∣tion of the Lord, but only vnder his long suffering. One thing more may hence be obserued, we are to mark  that the Apostle speakes not of the benefit of reconciliati∣on alone,Together with Gods mercy to∣wards vs, we are euer to consider our own misery. but with it puts the Colossians in minde of their miserable estate, in which they stood before they were re∣conciled, the conclusion hence may be generall (namely) this, that together with the mercy of God we are euer to consider our own miserie; the Lords bounty in any good blessing bestowed on body or soule, should euer bring vs to a consideration of our owne formerwretchednes, that is a rule of excellent vse, the practise of it will make vs truely humble, and truly thankfull to God for his mercy. If the rich man who hath come vp of small beginnings,  would but thinke of the Lords present bounty,It will make vs truly hum∣ble, and truly thankfull to Gods mercy. Gen. 32.10. together with his owne former pouertie, it would make him in all humilitie and thankfulnesse, to say with good Iacob, I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and all the trueth which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant, for with my staffe came I ouer this Iorden, and now haue I gotten two bands.
and if with the blessing of our apparell, wee did but consi∣der our own shame and sin vpon which apparell was giuen (for it came in vpon the fall) it would pull down the pride of many in the world; here is a rule of direction for thee in respect of apparell.Note. Some say you can giue no speciall di∣rection what manner of apparell we are to weare, and of what fashion our apparell ought to bee, how much lace, fringe, gold or siluer; &c. wee are to put vpon our apparell. Indeed tis true, the Scripture doth not set down these par∣ticulars, but yet consider thou with thy apparel, thine own misery, shame and desert by sin, and that will roote out thy vaine delight in thy apparell; remember thy apparell is a badge of sinne and the desert of sinne, and that will pull down thy pride, and make thee rather sigh than swell with pride, as many do in respect of their apparell. Come we to the seat and subiect of that enmity that was in the Colossians towards God before their reconciliation, (namely) their minds, & those ill affected in these words, (because your minds were set in euil works) the Apostles word in the original, here translated (minds) doth signifie agitatiō or discourse of mind & reason, wherby one thing is inferd vpon another, as when the minde doth not simply appre∣hend, but deduce one thing vpon another, that deduction is properly called  discourse of mind & reason, & that is the Apostles word,Interpreta∣tion. whereby no doubt he would haue vs to vnderstand al the chief powers of the soule (namely) rea∣son, will and affections, for as sound and true friendship a∣mongst men stands not only in consent of vnderstanding, when men conceaue the same things true or false, but in actual consent of wil and affections, & their enmity stands in the difference & dissent of minds, will and affections, so is there enmity between God & men, when the minds, wils and affections of men are opposite and against the wil and wisdom of God, therfore by the word (minds) we are to vn∣derstand, reason, will and affections (were set) these words are not expressed, but yet they are implied, the Apostle
speaking of the Colossians in their naturall condition; for in saying (their minds in euill works) he doth therby giue vs to vnderstand, that their minds had not in them only that originall corruption, that is common to the regenerate & vnregenerate, (euen the most regenerate hauing originall sin remaining in them) but that they had in thē actual sin∣fulnes, as dulnes in their mindes, ignorance, obliuion, per∣uersnes in their wills, frowardnesse in their affections, and that the powers of their soules were wholy bent vnto sin, therfore the words may wel be rendred as they are, bicause your minds were set on euill works, & the meaning of thē is briefly this, bicause your reason, will & affections, had in them actual sinfulnes, & were wholy bent & set vpon sin. Now here first obserue that the Apostle saith,Rom. 3.13.14 15.16.17.18. the Colos∣sians were enemies to God, not because their bodies were defiled with sin, as that their throat was an open sepulchre as he speakes Rom. 3.13.14. their mouthes full of cursing and bitternesse, &c. though those things no (doubt) were common amongst them before their conuersion, but be∣cause their mindes were set on euill workes. Hence we may gather that the beginning, and as it were  the head & fountain of all sin is the mind,All sinne begins in the minde. the inward facul∣ties of the soule are first defiled, & from thence flow filthy streames of all actuall sinnes. It is a point taught by Christ himselfe Mat. 15.18. that euill things which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart, for out of the hart saith he, come euill thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, slanders: where wee see he makes the heart, vnderstanding by that the inward powers of the soule, the root and beginning of all euill. Hence it is that the Apostle doth so often vrge renouation of minde, as Rom. 12.2. Be changed by the renuing of your minde, Eph. 4.23. Bee renewed in the spirit of your minde. Let vs cleanse our selues from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit,2. Cor. 7.1. and growe vp vnto full holinesse in the feare of God. And Dauid pray∣ed Psalme 51.10. that the Lord would create a cleane heart
within him, and there is reason also to prooue this, that the first and principall seat of sinne is the minde and soule, be∣cause all actiuitie and motion, good and bad is from the soule, the body is but the instrument of the soule. First, this serues to discouer vnto vs the errour of the Papists,Confutation of the Papists. who teach that the first motions of the minde dis∣ordered, euen the euill lust and concupiscence of the heart without consent of will to accomplish euill, is no sinne, this cannot stand with the truth now deliuered, for if the minde and heart be first defiled, and from thence comes actuall sinne, it must needs be, that the first motions of the minde to euill, and the last of the heart, though it be with∣out consent is sinne, yea in the regenerate, and it may easi∣ly be prooued, for euen the hauing of an euill thought in the minde is repugnant and contrary to the Law of God, and a fruit of corruption it is, such as we should neuer haue had, if wee had stood in the state of innocency, and there∣fore naught, and a sinne. Ob.Yea, but saith the Papists, we read, Iam. 1.15. that when lust hath conceiued it bringeth forth sinne: marke (saith he) concupiscence tempteth, and allureth by some euill mo∣tion, but that is no sinne till it doth conceiue (that is) ob∣taine some liking of the will in giuing eare to it, and not ex∣pelling it. To this I answer,  that the Apostle saith, not that con∣cupiscence is no sinne till it haue conceiued, that is but their glosse which corrupt the text, but the Apostle makes a distinction betweene concupiscence and actuall sinne and saith, when it hath conceiued it brings forth actuall sinne, (for sinne brought foorth is actuall) and the Apo∣stle speakes of the degrees by which actuall sinne is com∣mitted, as that at the first lust enticeth, then followes con∣sent, and that consent breakes out into action, action fi∣nished brings forth death; and that is the meaning of the Apostle, and so it still remaines a truth, that the first mo∣tion of the minde, and last of the heart to euill with
consent euen of it selfe is sinne, though not in that height and kinde that outward actuall sinnes are. Secondly, is it so that euery actuall sinne is a streame  issuing from the corrupt fountaine within, namely,We are to keepe our hearts with all diligence. the minde and inward faculties of the soule, then it behooues euery one to follow the councell of the wise man, Pro. 4.23 Keepe thy heart with all diligence for thereout commeth life. And in the first place, we are to looke to the change and and renouation of our minds, & the purging of our hearts. It is to small purpose, for a man to cleanse his hand, his foote, his eyes, his tongue, &c. so long as his minde and heart remaine polluted and vncleane, there being a roote of bitternesse in the heart and minde, it will euer bee sen∣ding forth bitter and vnsauorie fruits; yea, the greater and more excellent naturall gifts of minde, a man hath, as wit, capacitie,Note. &c. the fitter instruments hath hee for the com∣mitting of sinne, if they bee not sanctified; and there∣fore aboue all we are to looke to our hearts. And that we may so doe, we must not onely see grosse temptations, but labour to finde out our inward corruptions, and the priuy temptations of Satan laid against our mindes. The Apo∣stle saith, 2. Cor. 2.11. wee must not bee ignorant of his en∣terprises, of his wiles and fetches, of his secret conueyance of sinne into our soules. For example, when Satan can∣not fasten vpon vs either by violence or fraude to doe wrong to our brethren in regard of their goods, yet euen then wee must not bee secure, but stand vpon our guard, and spie out whether hee doth not cast into our mindes, a secret liking of the goods of our neighbour, tickling and deluding our hearts, and causing them to wish, Oh would such an house, such a field, such a plat of ground, such a seruant, or the like were mine, for thus Satan will bee tempering with our hearts, and thus many times conuay sinne into them, when wee see it not, nor thinke not of it, Saint Paul himselfe thought not of
the danger of this secret desire of heart, till he came to be∣hold himselfe in the glasse of the last commandement, Rom. 7.7. we must therfore labour to finde out these priuy temptations, and fortifie, strengthen and guard our hearts against them, and repell them, and not suffer them to en∣ter. Men that looke not into their owne hearts, and finde not out the corruption of them, and watch not most nar∣rowly ouer them, but onely abstaine from outward grosse sinne (as most men if they come so farre thinke all is well) the Lord many times deales with them proportionably, euen in this life he layes his heauy hand vpon the inward soule,Rom. 1.28. and torments the minde when the body is neither sicke nor sore, for it is iust with the Lord, wherein we sinne therein to punish vs. As the Heathen regarded not to know God, so the Lord in his iust iudgement gaue them vnto a reprobate minde to doe those things which are not conuenient, as their sinne was in their mindes, so his punishment seazed and settled vpon their mindes. Let this stirre vs vp to labour to search our owne hearts, and to finde out the priuy assaults of Satan layd against them, and to arme our selues against them. The next thing wee haue to marke, is that the Apostle saith, their mindes were set in euill workes, or were in euill, their mindes were as it were hem'd in and enclosed with sinne before their conuersion. Hence wee are taught, that such are yet vncalled, and are not actually reconciled to God,Such as be yet vncalled and not actu∣ally reconci∣led to God, are in the greatest bon∣dage that may be. they are in the grea∣test bondage that possibly can be, their mindes and all the inward powers of their soules are enthralled in the bon∣dage of sinne, which is the greatest bondage that can bee, for why? euen a gally-slaue vnder the Turke, though hee bee in extreame hard seruitude and bondage, yet his minde may bee at libertie, free from the chaines of sinne, but he that is vncalled, & yet in his naturall state, his mind is fettered and chained with sinne, so as he cannot thinke, will or affect any thing but sinne, and this ought to bee
considered, both to teach such as are called out of the state of their naturall bondage into the libertie of the sonnes of God, to be thankefull to God for his mercy,  and to stir vp others to hasten by all good meanes out of that miserable thraldome,Thankfulnes to God for deliuerance out of that thraldome, & care to hasten out of it be∣ing in it. Motiues to that purpose. and that they may haue a true apprehension of their misery, and be stirred vp to hasten of it: let them consider these few things. First, he that is in his naturall state is a slaue to God him∣selfe, and that is cleare by his slauish feare, for hee cannot feare God as a childe of God. Secondly, he is a slaue to good men, such as feare God, and in whom the graces of God appeare, they haue and holde a kinde of soueraignty ouer him, it is euen as hell to him to be in their company. Thirdly, he is a slaue to the world, and to the creatures in the world, as the couetous man to his gold, some to the starres, some to daies, as forsooth, this is a dismall day, and therefore they may not take in hand any businesse that day, some to the flying of a crow, the crossing of an an hare, and the like. Fourthly, hee is a slaue to himselfe, either to his body, as the glutton and drunkard, or to the passions of his soule, as lust, anger, enuie; or to his conscience, and that in re∣spect of accusation, testimonie and torment, his conscience accusing for sinne, maketh him thinke euery thing else doth accuse him, as the birds and such like; his conscience giuing testimonie to the trueth, many times against him∣selfe, as Moses saith, their God is not as our God,Deut. 32.31. euen our enemies being iudges, his conscience tormenting him, so as many times it makes him his owne butcher. These things well considered they are able to mooue a∣ny man, and will indeed mooue him that belongs to God to looke about him, and if he finde himselfe in his naturall state, to hasten out of it, & that we deceiue not our selues, as many doe thinking they are deliuered from their natu∣rall state, when they are not, let vs examine our selues by
this one rule. See whether thou hast suffered an holy and heauenly violence, in respect of thy best pleasing sinne, to which thou art most naturally enclined: if thou find that the spi∣rit of God working by the word, hath drawen thee from vnder the power and tyranny of that sinne, that thou hast not now such pleasure in it, but thou doest striue against it, and auoide occasions leading vnto it, then thou art entred into the way of life. But if thou finde thy selfe held in that snare of the De∣uill,2. Tim. 2.26. as the Apostle speakes, at his will, that so soone as oc∣casion is offered, thou doest apprehend it, and that with much pleasure and delight, then surely I can giue thee no comfort, but let thee vnderstand that Cain and Iudas were as neere heauen as yet thou art. Let this be thought on and remembred. VER. 22. In the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and vnblameable, and without fault in his sight. Heere we haue part of that proposition, that is layd be∣fore vs in these two verses, expressing the materiall cause of the reconciliation of the Colossians to God, in these words (in the body of his flesh through death) then followes in the second amplification of the Apostles proposition, from the end of their reconciliation in the next words (to make you holy and vnblameable, and without fault in his fight. Interpreta∣tion.Come wee to the first of these, In the body, that is, in the body of his Sonne Christ (it is added) of his flesh, to let vs vnderstand that Christ had and hath a true humane body, a body of flesh and bloud, like vnto ours in all things, sinne onely excepted (through death) that is, through death of that body, and so the words are thus to bee concei∣ued, as if the Apostle had said, In the true humane body of Christ his Sonne, deliuered to death, crucified and broken vpon
the crosse. I might heere stand to shew that Christ his bo∣dy crucified was and now glorified in heauen, is a true sub∣stantiall body, a body of flesh taken from the substance of the Virgin Marie his mother, and not a phantasticall body, a body in appearance onely, a mathematicall or maiesticke body as the Vbiquitaries foolishly call it, who affirm that Christ his body by reason of the personal vnion is euery where present, but to passe by that. Obserue wee that the Apostle said vers 10. it pleased the father to recon∣cile al things vnto himselfe, and to set at peace through the bloud of his crosse, and heere hee saith that the Colossians were reconciled in the body of his flesh, hence ariseth this point of instruction. That both the body and bloud of Christ is the price of  redemption, and the matter of reconciliation,Both the bo∣dy and bloud of Christ be the price of redemption. and when wee read of that wee haue remission of sinnes through the bloud of Christ, wee must vnderstand the whole passion of Christ, euen his body broken, & his bloud shed, a point that need not be stood vpon for the proof of it (no questiō) we easily conceiue and condescend to the truth of it, yet is it not needles to be remembred, it may serue to direct our faith touching the death of Christ that we are to eye by faith the body & bloud of Christ for the remission of our sins, wee finde it taught by Christ himselfe that to the nou∣rishment of our soules to life eternall,  wee are by faith to feed both on his body and bloud Iohn 6.53.We are to eye by faith the body & bloud of Christ for the remission of our sinnes. Except ye eat the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you, and in the next verse whosoeuer eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud hath eternall life, and our Sauiour hath ordained in the Sacrament of the Supper outward visible signes both bread and wine to represent & bring to our remembrance both his body and bloud, and to signifie vnto vs that Christ is distinctly set before vs in the Sacrament, as meat and drinke, and as perfect spirituall nourishment to our soules yea Bellarmine himselfe the Arch-pillar of the Romane Synagogue saith in plaine
termes, that the forme of bread alone doth not exactly represent Christ as dead, vnlesse withall there bee seene his bloud as shed, and the forme of wine alone doth not sufficiently represent Christ as sacrificed, for (sayth hee) onely bloud is no sacrifice;Confutation of the Papists. wickedly therefore deale the Papists, we may conclude against them out of this their owne mouths, who in the Sacrament of the supper take away the cup from the people, and will not suffer them to haue it; beside the breach of the institution of the Sacra∣ment, they goe flat against the doctrine of the Apostle, concerning one principall vse of the Sacrament, which is to shew foorth the death of Christ, which is liuely done, when both bread and wine are deliuered, one for the flesh, the other for the bloud and not otherwise, and therfore he sayth,. Cor. 11.26. as often as ye shall eat this bread and drinke this cup, yee shew the Lords death till he come; yea, they are no lesse com∣manding speeches ver. 28. let a man eat of this bread and drinke of this cup, then that is, let a man examine himselfe, it is therefore sacrilegious in the highest degree to with∣hold the cup from the people, it destroyeth the integrity and soundnesse of the Sacrament, and leaues to the people but a maimed and halfe matter of spirituall nourishment in Christ, and an halfe satisfaction for their sinnes which is most wicked and damnable: let vs therefore hold fast and reioyce in the perfect & most full ordinance of Christ, in that both bread and wine are deliuered vnto vs, and let vs not forgoe the comfort we may haue in this poynt, that they are visible signes of the body and bloud of Christ, and doe signifie that by faith we feed vpon whole Christ, both his body and bloud for remission of our sinnes, to the per∣fect nourishment of our soules to life eternall. One thing further is offered vnto vs from these words, I haue heere∣tofore spoken of it, ver. 14. therefore I will onely now re∣call it to memory. The Apostle sayth not simply, in the body of his flesh, but addes through death, as before the bloud of his crosse.
Hence we are taught: that we are not to fasten the eyes  of our mindes vpon the body and bloud of Christ simply,Christ his bo∣dy broken & his bloud shed ought to be the obiect of our faith. but vpon his body broken, and his bloud shed, especially when wee come to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Wouldst thou receiue grace, comfort, saluation or any blessing from the Lord, come then to Christ hanging, bleeding and dying vpon the crosse,  if thou come not to God by Christ,Grace com∣fort and eue∣ry good thing comes from God thorow the death of Christ. and by him suffering and bleeding on the crosse (as one saith well) there is no hearing God, no hel∣ping God, no sauing God, no God of mercy to thee at all. Come wee to the second amplification of the Apostles proposition in the words following (To make you holy and vnblamable, & without fault in his sight) the word (holy) to o∣mit other acceptions of it, doth heere signifie pure, cleane from all spot of sinne, for so the next words do expound it vnblameable, and without fault,Interpreta∣tion. the word (vnblameable) is giuen to Christ, he is said to be a lambe vndefiled, there is the same word that heere is vsed, when therefore the Apo∣stle saith to make you holy, and addes further vnblamea∣ble, and without fault, his meaning is this,1. Pet. 1.19. to make you pure and cleane, so as you cannot iustly bee challenged, blamed or reprooued for any spot of sinne: Now this ho∣linesse is twofold, either by imputation of Christ his holi∣nesse or inherent in vs, and that is onely begun in this life, and shall be consummate and made perfect in the life to come, and that the Apostle doth meane not only the first, but also the second, it is cleere by the like place, Ephes. 5.26.27. where he sets it out in the same terms, and sayth, it is wrought by the washing of water through the worde, therefore inherent holinesse is onely begunne in this life, and to be made perfect when wee shall bee personally set before the Lord, and shall see him face to face in Hea∣uen, so much also the Apostles phrase doth imply, thus then the words are to be conceiued, to set you before his owne face free from all spot of sinne by imputation of
Christs holinesse, and by holinesse inherent begun in this life, to be made perfect when you shall see the Lord face to face in Heauen. Heere first wee are to marke that the Apostle sayth, the end why the Lord did reconcile the Colossians to himselfe, communicating vnto them the merit of Christ  his death, it was to make them holy: hence ariseth this conclusion,Reconciliati∣on with God and holinesse inherent euer goe together. that reconciliation with God, and holinesse euen inherent begunne in this life euer go together. Who∣soeuer is reconciled to God by the death of Christ, is in some measure sanctified, and hath holinesse begunne in him in this life, for its the end the Lord doth propound to himselfe in reconciling men vnto himselfe, and can the Lord bee disappointed of his end? What shall withstand him?Tit. 2 14. againe it is one end of the death of Christ to purge from sinne, he gaue himselfe, saith the Apostle, to redeem from iniquity, and to purge vs to be a peculiar people vn∣to himselfe, zealous of good workes. Therefore, to whomsoeuer Christ is a Sauiour by merit to him also he is a Sauiour by efficacy, these two are euer vndiuided. Now then is it so, that reconciliation with God, and holinesse euer goe together,They deceiue themselues who thinke they haue part in the merit of Christ his death and yet want holines. how then do they deceiue themselues, who thinke that the merit of Christ his death belongs to them, and yet haue not any measure of holi∣nesse in them, nay whatsoeuer is holy they euen hate to bee drawen to it, whatsoeuer is vnholy they wallow in it, they tumble in it, they ioy in it, yea, they euen wish to liue in it, and grow old in it, such there bee too many, and yet they fancy to themselues, that the merit of Christ be∣longs to them, which indeed is a meere fancy helped for∣ward by strong delusion of the Diuell: I may bee bold to tell thee whosoeuer thou art, for the Lord himselfe hath taught mee so to speake, Heb. 12.14. If thou liue not in some measure an holy life here, thou shalt neuer see the face of God to thy comfort and saluation, thou shalt see
him indeede but to thy shame and confusion, so as thou shalt call to the mountaines to fall on thee, and to hide thee, but in vaine from his presence; let our meditation a little settle on this poynt, and let vs often thinke vpon the difference of holinesse and prophanesse, the one proouing vnto vs euerlasting ioy with God when this life shall bee ended, and the other assured woe with the Diuell and his Angels in the bottomelesse pit of hell for euer, if wee throughly thinke of this difference, wee shall finde it a peircing argument to pricke vs forward to an holy life, it will doubtlesse force from vs one of these con∣clusions. Now liue like a Christian amongst men, and euer liue like a Saint among the Angels in Heauen, or now soake in sinne and wallow in filthy pleasure for a season, and then rot in the reward of it, an euerlasting curse from the presence of the Lord, in the pit of euerlasting per∣dition. One thing more briefely note wee, the Apostle saith, not to make you onely holy, but addes further vnblame∣able and without fault in his sight, Hence wee may gather that where the Lord hath be∣gunne  true holinesse, there he will make it perfect,The Lord ha∣uing begunne true holines in any he will perfect it. 1. Thes. 5.23. whom hee hath begunne to sanctifie, he will fully perfect in the end, and this is further cleere by that prayer of the Apo∣stle, Now the very God of peace sanctifie you throughout, this was a prayer of faith, hee was perswaded the Lord would sanctifie them as himselfe sayth Phillip. 1.6. I am perswaded of this same thing, that hee that hath be∣gunne this good worke in you,  will performe it vntill the day of Iesus Christ;Comfort to them in whō the Lord hath begunne the least measure of true holi∣nesse. and this is a notable comfort to all such, in whom the Lord hath begunne the least measure of true holinesse, they may bee sure hee will perfect it. Some complaine of the want of sanctification (an ho∣ly complaint found but in few) yet some thus complaine
that they finde a dulnesse and deadnesse in respect of all good motions, and the diuell taking aduantage vpon this, many times perswades them, they are fallen away, and God hath giuen them ouer. Such must know, it is a course euer held by the Lord, it is that which Gods chosen haue euer tasted, yet without reiection, they haue had altera∣tions in them, somtimes sweet motions in their soules, sometimes deadnesse and dulnesse of heart, what change thinke you felt Dauid, when hee cryed, Psal. 15.11. Oh cast mee not away from thy presence, and take not thine holy Spirit from me. If euer thou hast had the first fruites of the Spirit, an hatred of thine owne sinne, a purpose of not sinning in any thing, though now deadnesse pos∣sesse thine heart yet content thy selfe, and waite for full holinesse in time to bee giuen: the Lord hath once begun holinesse in thee, and he will perfect it. It is an excellent place and to bee remembred of vs. Wee through the Spirit, waite for the hope of righteousnesse through faith, The Apostle sayth not,Gal. 5.5. they which are iustified doe in the spirit by faith yet feele the hope of righteousnesse, but they wait still for it. So thou in the midst of conflicts and terrors which often assault thee wayt patiently for righteousnesse and in time it shall be reuealed and made perfect vnto thee in the Kingdome of heauen. VER. 23. If yee continue, grounded and stablished in the faith, and bee not mooued away from the hope of the Gospell, whereof ye haue heard, and which hath beene preached to euery creature which is vnder heauen, whereof I Paul am a Minister. The relation of this verse, to the former stands thus, if yee continue in the faith, yee shall bee set in the sight of God holy and vnblameable, therefore continue in it, and so it also containes the first argument, by which the Apostle labors to perswade the Colossians to continuance
in the faith taught by the Gospell,The fourth part of this chapter an exhortation to continue in the true faith. for there begins the fourth part of this Chapter, containing an exhortation to continuance in the faith; vrged by sundry argu∣ments to the end of the chapter, and the first argument is this. If ye continue in the faith, yee shall obtaine the end of your faith, the saluation of your soules and this is not bare∣ly propounded, but amplified by the manner of continu∣ance, in these words, grounded and established, and further cleered by the proper passion, or by the property of such as are grounded and established, that they suffer not them∣selues to bee mooued away from the truth in the next words, (and bee not mooued away from the Gospell. Then followes the meanes how they came to haue that hope of the Gospell (namely) by hearing the Gospell prea∣ched, and least they should except and say, the Gospell that wee heard, wee heard it onely of Epaphras our Mi∣nister, and wee may doubt whether it bee the true Go∣spell of Christ or no. This obiection the Apostle preuents by two arguments. That first it was the same that was preached through∣out the world. And secondly, the same that Paul preached, and wher∣of he was a Minister: which hath beene preached to euery creature, which is vnder Heauen, whereof I Paul am a mi∣nister. Come we to the word of this verse,Interpreta∣tion. as they are layd downe by the Apostle, and first of these words (if ye conti∣nue grounded & stablished in the faith) the conditionall note (if) doth not heere imply doubting in the Apostle of the continuance of true beleeuers in their faith, as of an vncer∣taine euent, but the excellency and difficulty of their vn∣doubted continuance, and the Apostles earnest desire of the same & that appeares in that he therunto perswades by many arguments,Phil 3.11. we finde the word so vsed in many pla∣ces of the Scriptures. Looke one for many, if by any meanes I might attaine vnto the resurrection of the dead.
The Apostle doth not there doubt of his resurrection, but by that conditionall note makes it knowne, how ex∣cellent a good thing it was, and how exceeding much of him desired. In the Faith] By Faith we are to vnderstand the gift of Faith, together with the matter of it (namely) the do∣ctrine of Faith the Gospell, for the Apostle heere speaks of the gift of Faith, with reference to the doctrine of Faith, as hee explaines himselfe in the next words (hope of the Gospell) (grounded and established) the wordes are Me∣taphoricall, borrowed from knowne things. The first from an house built on a sure foundation. The second from such as doe sitte fast in a sure seate, to signifie the firme and constant resolution and condition of true be∣leeuers, thus then the words are to be construed and con∣ceiued. If ye continue firme and constant in faith wrought in you by the Gospell. Now for the ground of the first instruction, wee are to marke that the Apostle vers 4. said, he heard of the Faith of the Colossians, and heere hee perswades them to continuance in Faith, the generall conclusion follow∣ing hence, is this. That we must not onely beginne well, but we must also continue in goodnes to the end.We must not only beginne well, but also continue in goodnes. The Lord doth require vs, that we not only like of good and godly motions for a time, and after suffer them to va∣nish, to be quenched and dye in vs, but that we so beginne that wee may continue, and so continue in goodnesse that we may indure to the end. To this purpose we find ma∣ny exhortations, as quench not the spirit, Stirre vp the gifts that are in you as fire is stirred vp with blowing,1. Thef. 5.10. 1. Cor. 6.13. and stand fast in the Faith, the equity and reason heereof is two∣folde. First, because the Lord respects the fruit, and not the blossome, he calls himselfe Alpha & Omega, the beginning
and the end in many places of the Reuelation, and there∣fore hee requires a good ende as well as a good begin∣ning. Secondly, it is the property of true vertue not onely to  begin well, but also to end well. Paul blames the Galla∣thians cap. 3.3. that hauing begun in the spirit would bee made perfect by the flesh, and our Sauiour shewes what shame it is to him that begins to build and cannot finish his worke, Luke 14.30. this man began to build and was not able to make an end. To beginne well and not to continue brings shame and therefore it is no true vertue, for the crowne of that is glory not shame. Before we come to vrge this duty, it will not be amisse to shew some speciall meanes how wee may continue in goodnesse begun in vs, for the meanes to that purpose are not onely generall, as diligent hearing and reading of the word, prayer, Sacraments, conference, good company, &c. but also more speciall, such as serue peculiarly for the con∣tinuance and preseruation of some particular grace begun in vs, for example. A speciall meanes for continuance of humilitie begun in our hearts,Special means for continu∣ance of humi∣litie begun in vs. is a continuall meditation of our own vilenes and corruption, a looking on the good things of other men as well as on our owne good things, Philip. 2.4. A conside∣ration of our owne grosse sinnes. A through examination without partiall affection of the reports other men make of vs. So a speciall meanes to continue loue to the worde of God when it is begun in vs,Special means to continue loue to Gods word begun in vs. is First to labour to haue a liuely sence and feeling of the sweetenesse of the word. For the more we feele the com∣fort of it, the more wee shall bee enflamed with a loue  to it. Secondly, to keep daily obseruation of the accomplish∣ment  of the trueth of it in our selues or others, either
in the mercies of God promised to them that feare him, or in the iudgments of God threatned against the wicked. Thus we finde that Dauids loue to the word was increa∣sed and continued.Psal. 119.96. I haue seen an ende of all perfecti∣on, but thy commaundement is exceeding large; then it followes in the next verse, Oh how loue I thy Law, it is my meditation continually. As if hee had said, all things in the world, euen the most perfect come to an ende, but not on iot or tittle of the word of God faileth, but all is accomplished, oh therefore, how loue I thy worde. I might thus goe on in many particulars, but by this that hath been said, we haue some light giuen vs, what speciall meanes wee are to vse for the continuance of any grace already begun in vs. Now touching the continuance of loue to the worde, men haue need a litle to be rowsed, for now generally men begin to decline and to fall from their first loue,Reuel. 2.4. as the ho∣ly Ghost speakes. We see the truth is of such maiestie in it selfe, as it captiueth the hearts of very reprobates vnto a liking of it, but it is only as a slash of lightning that comes, and is gone almost in a moment.Motiues to stir vs vp to continue loue to the word of God. That men therefore may be stirred vp to continue their loue and liking of the word of God, let them consider these two things. First, as it is not any sinne, but continuance in that sinne  without repentance till death that brings damnation. So it is not any good in vs, nor done by vs that shall in mercy be rewarded, vnlesse we continue in it to the end, only con∣tinuance in well doing (without totall or final falling from it) shall be crowned; be faithfull to the death, saith Christ to the Church of Smirna, Reuel. 2.10. and I will giue thee the crowne of life. Againe, consider that his condition is better that neuer  begunne to doe well, then his who once begun, and then falls wholly from it. For that is like a relapse into some great sicknesse, which wee know is most dangerous, it is the doctrine of Christ himselfe,Mat. 12.45. that the last state of that
man is worse then the beginning, and there is reason for it, for then followes hardnesse, impenitencie, and a grea∣ter waight of condemnation, yea it is dangerous to fall from grace though it be but in part, it made Paul in doubt of the Galathians cap. 4.20. If then we would not loose our labour, and misse our reward; if wee would not fall into such a state, as is farre worse than if wee had neuer begun to doe well, bringing with it hardnesse of heart, and grea∣ter condemnation, let as many as haue any loue to the word, or loue to their brethren, any zeale of Gods glory, or other grace begunne in them, labour by all good meanes to continue and increase in the same; shall the wicked bee more constant in wickednesse, then wee in the feare of the Lord? They serue the Deuill, their owne lusts, and their reward shall bee hell, and shall they bee more constant in the seruice of the Deuill, then we in the seruice of our gra∣cious God? let it shame vs, of this we ought to be ashamed indeed. The next thing wee haue to marke, is the order of the words of the Apostle, speaking of the manner of continu∣ance in the faith. He saith grounded and stablished. Hence wee are taught, that we must first be grounded in  Faith before we can be established.We must first be grounded in faith before we can be sta∣blished in it. First we must be firm∣ly setled in the doctrine of the Gospell, before we can bee stable and constant in the profession of the Gospell. For why? in common reason we know it to be true, that there is no constant stabilitie but vppon firme ground, an house or other building neuer stands stable and constant vpon rotten ground, or on a sandie foundation, and with this agrees that of Iames cap. 1.8. A wauering minded man is vnstable in all his waies, the minde or heart beeing dou∣ble and deceitfull, the whole course of the life is answera∣ble, it behooues euery one therefore to bee well groun∣ded in the doctrine of the Gospell, yea such as are ig∣norant must bee content, and thinke it no shame in their olde age to learne the Catechisme, and first grounds
of religion,  & to perswade the necessity of this duty, con∣sider with mee,Ignorant per∣sons must suf∣fer themselues to be catechi∣sed in their old age. that such as are ignorant, and not well grounded in the knowledge of the trueth, they lie open as a prey to Atheists and Papists, wee see now the Papist gathers ground vpon vs, and no maruell, because people are not well grounded in the truth, the Iesuiticall decei∣uers, and Romish rable, besides their subtiltie of wit, wher∣by they are fit to deceiue, they set many faire collours vp∣on their cunning perswasions,Seauen faire deceiuing co∣lours of the Papists. as first Scripture, but that by addition, detraction, or some allegoricall sense & glosse depraued; secondly, depth of learning, as Christ speaks of the deepnesse of Satan, Reu. 2.24. and that confirmed by reuelations; thirdly, great and glorious titles, of Aposto∣licall succession and antiquitie; fourthly, humilitie in vo∣luntarie subiection, and not sparing the body, as wee read in the second chapter of this Epistle 23. fiftly, fained and lying miracles, 2. Thessall. 2.9. sixtly, flattering and faire speech, of which the Apostle speakes, Rom. 16.18. Last of all, obstinate suffering of death, wherein they much glo∣ry, and how shall a silly vnstable soule withstand these thinges, surely without the great mercy of God, it is not possible, therefore men haue need to bee well grounded: againe consider such as are not well grounded in the truth, they profit little, or nothing by sermons, a sermon to them is like a great loafe set before little children, they stand and wonder at the preacher,Note. but profit little or nothing by the word preached, and if they see some men of note fall from true religion, then they begnne to stagger, and are distracted into sundry cogitations, and say there bee so many opinions as they knowe not what to hold, Peter playing the Iew, other Iewes dissemble with him, yea Barnabas is brought into their dissimulation also. Wee see then the necessitie of this duety,Gal. 2.13. that it is needfull to be grounded in the trueth. Let vs therefore neuer rest till we truly vnderstand the grounds and principles of religi∣on, and bee setled, and fully resolued of the trueth of
them, that so we may follow the truth in loue of the truth, as the Apostle speaks, Ephes. 4.15. and that we may cheer∣fully embrace it, and constantly hold it both in life and death. For the grounding of the next point, wee are to marke; the Apostle saith not, if faith continue grounded in you, but if ye continue grounded in the faith. Hence I gather, that faith must not bee built, and as it  were set vppon our hearts, which as the Prophet saith,Faith must not be built on our hearts, but our hearts must be built vpon faith, as a firm founda∣tion. Ierem. 17.9. are deceitfull tottering seats, rotten founda∣tions, but our hearts must bee built, and set vpon faith as vppon a firme foundation, wee must rise vp as a building riseth from the ground vpon the foundation of faith, (that is) vppon the doctrine of faith, vppon the doctrine of reli∣gion, and the feare of God taught and comprised in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles, in which sense it is said in expresse tearmes, that the Ephesians were built vppon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. Eph. 2.20. (that is) vppon their doctrine, and Iude in his Epi∣stle 20. exhorteth to build our selues in our holy faith, and the Apostle Paule taking his leaue of the Church of Ephesus, Acts 20.32. commendeth them to God, and to the word of his grace, which (saith he) is able to build fur∣ther, &c. These and many other places of like sort do meet together in this point of instruction. That our harts must be built vpon the doctrine of faith, namely the Gospell, yea generally vpon the whole worde, as a sure foundation, and not the word vpon our hearts. Some may say, how is that to be done? I answere,  first by beleeuing the worde, for though the doctrine of the worde bee a foundation in it selfe, yet t is not so to vs, vnlesse wee beleeue it, by faith wee are cou∣pled and knit to this foundation, and it is made a founda∣tion to vs. Secondly, by yeelding obedience vnto it, for so our Sa∣uiour saith, Mat. 7.24. hee that heareth of me these words
and doth the same, he is a builder vpon the worde; yea, a wise builder, he builds vpon it as vpon a rocke. Wee see then that this duty is cleared, and the manner how to performe it made knowne vnto vs. First, is this our duty to build our selues vpon the Gospel, and generally vpon the worde,Confutation of the Papists. then certainely, we are not, as the Papists teach, to build vpon the Church as vppon a foundation. They teach, that wee are to ground and sta∣blish our selues vppon the authoritie of the Church, and shame not to say, there can bee no certaintie of the points of religion, no nor yet of the Scriptures themselues, but onely by the iudgement of the present Church of Rome, this is contrary to the doctrine now deliuered, and pro∣ued, and this makes the Church the foundation of Scrip∣ture, and not the Scripture the foundation of the Church, as indeed it is, and euery member of the Church accor∣ding to the doctrine of the Apostle, must bee grounded vpon it. Ob.Yea, but saith the Papist, how shall wee know Scripture to bee Scripture, but by the Church, the Church doth determine which is Scripture, therefore the authoritie of the Church is greater than Scripture, and in this re∣spect, as a foundation, and the determination of Scripture to bee Scripture, is built on the vniuersall consent of the Church? I answer this with a like question; How shall wee know the Church to bee the Church but by the Scripture, yea, doubtlesse the Scripture must needes first point out the Church, and that being knowne, it determineth of the number of the bookes of Scripture, yet by Scripture, and so Scripture is euer the first ground and foundation. Againe, vniuersall consent of the Church doth not per∣swade the conscience that Scripture is Scripture: It is not a sufficient ground to build vppon, but onely as an induce∣ment, it doth mooue to a reuerent regard of the writings of the Apostles and Prophets, and thus saith Augustine,
Non credidissem scriptura nisi me commouisset authoritas Ec∣clesia. Is it so that our harts must be built on the word, and not  the worde vpon our hearts,Reproof of them that will haue the word of God fitted to their hearts. then such persons are far short of their duety, they come within compasse of reproofe, who will haue the worde to bee fitted and framed to their hearts, and not their hearts to the word, this is to build the worde on their hearts, and not their hearts on the worde, and indeed to turne the speech of the holy Ghost to their owne fancy, and to temper the worde to their owne hu∣mor, to set downe their owne conclusion, and then force the worde to prooue it; you will say, is there any such? too many without question, is it not thus with the Vsurer, one grounded in that sinne, will not hee, notwithstanding any reproofe, by plaine euidence of Scripture still holde his conclusion, and resolue to continue in his sinne, and to that purpose take paines to seeke out places of Scrip∣ture, not to checke his sinne, and to build him vp in holy reformation, but such as may seeme to him (blin∣ded with the loue of his gaine) to fauour his sinne, is it not thus with the drunkard, the vncleane person, or any other grosse and grounded sinner? yes surely, as one sayth, no face is so foule, but it shall finde a pain∣ter: no sinne is so grosse, but some grounded in that sinne will seeke to set a faire colour vppon it, and not onely a common colour, as to call couetousnesse good husbandry, pride cleanlinesse, but which is most wicked, to fetch painting out of the worde of God (whence I be∣seech you) comes all extenuation of sinne, whence is it that men quarrell, and wrangle about the nature, the great∣nesse, the qualitie, or desert of sinne, and say their sinne is not so great as Preachers would make it? but euen from hence, that they are tempering with some place of Scrip∣ture to fit that to their owne corrupt humours, and to make that serue for extenuation of their sinne: (for exam∣ple) some are too bold with that of the Apostle: Loue co∣uereth
the multitude of sinnes: they frame and construe too much to their owne liking, euen to backe them in their concealement and smothering of some grosse sinnes, which they ought to discouer and make known, that they might be punished, to perswade therefore to the contrary duty. Motiues to stirre vs vp to frame our hearts to the word of God.That we labour to frame our hearts to the word, as the building to the foundation, and not the word to our harts in any part or parcell of it, consider we these two things. First, such as frame the word to their harts to abet them  in any sinne, and not their hearts to the rule of the worde, the Lord in his iust iudgement giues them vp to follow the counsells of their owne hearts, yea so farre, as if they aske their owne hearts whether they shall goe on in the way to the Deuill, they answer as false Prophets vse to do, (goe and prosper) they answere without checke and con∣trolement (go) it was Ahabs case: 1. Kings 12. in respect of temporary destruction: hee would haue the worde of the Lord framed to the pleasing of his owne fancie, going on in a wrong course, therefore the Lord gaue him vp to fol∣low the liking of his owne heart, and not to take counsell with Micaiah the true Prophet (verse 8.) but with such as pleased his humour, who bid him goe and prosper, when he went to his owne destruction. Againe, consider that such as frame the worde to their hearts to maintaine them in sinne, they breake that com∣maundement Deut. 12.32. they either put something to the worde, or take something from it, by wrong constru∣ction, or application, they either adde or detract, or else it would neuer seeme to boulster out sinne, and then in what case they stand let them see, euen lyable to all the plagues written in the booke of God, and to haue their portion taken out of the booke of life,Reu. 22.18.9. if then we would not be gi∣uen ouer to the lust of our owne hearts, to follow it to our owne destruction, if we would not haue our portion taken out of the book of God, and stand subiect to al the plagues
that are written in the booke of God, lets take heed wee neuer goe about to frame, the word to the corruption of our hearts to vphold vs in sinne, but let vs frame our hearts and make them plyable to beleeue and obey the worde in all things, yea neuer giue thy selfe rest till the worde lye vnder thine heart euen hidde as Dauid saith, Psalm 119.11. as a foundation on which all thy affecti: ons and actions are grounded and built, and pray e∣uer with (Dauid) in the same Psalme verse 36. Incline, bend downe mine heart vnto thy testimonies: and not thy testi∣monies to my heart. Now to the words following: (and bee not moued away from the hope of the Gospell:) by hope of the Gospell) wee are not to vnderstand the thing hoped for,Interpreta∣tion. (n) life and glo∣ry in heauen, as verse. 5. but the gift and grace of hope wrought in the heart by the Gospell which is a certaine, and patient expectation of life eternall, purchased by the actiue and passiue obedience of Christ and promised in the Gospell to all that truely beleeue in him, and not to bee mooued away from it, is not to loose it, not to let it fall out of our hearts, and so the wordes are breefly thus to bee conceaued: and loose not your certaine and patient expectation of life eternall purchased by the per∣fect obedience of Christ, and promised in the Gospell to all that truly beleeue in him. The first thing wee haue to marke from these words is, that the Apostle makes it the property of such as are surelie grounded, and established in the true faith, not to bee mooued away from a certaine expectation of life eternall. Hence we conclude that true beleeuers may haue, and  haue indeed a certaine and immoueable hope of life eter∣nall, they certainely looke for life and saluation,True belee∣uers may and do certainely look for eter∣nall life. for why (hope is the daughter of Faith, and true Faith beeing a necessary fruite euer following election, as appeares plainely: Acts 13.48, and so an infallible argument of
confirmation to the soule of him in whom it is, that hee is elected to life and saluation, it must needs bring foorth an hope correspondent and answerable vnto it, euen a certain expectation of that which is vndoubtedly beleeued. Againe the hope of true beleeuers comes from the te∣stimony of the Spirit, and is one of the fruits of Gods spi∣rit as might bee prooued at large, and therefore it is cer∣taine and sure. Ob.Yea but saith the Papist, true faith may be lost, the te∣stimony of the Spirit may be extinct, the fruits of graces may wither and come to nothing, how then can any man build on these grounds certaine and neuer fayling hope of life eternall,  see the boldnesse of carnall reason, when men trust to that and want the guidance of Gods spirit, what is this but to call into question the promise of God, the deedes of our blessed Sauiour, the prayer of Christ, the eternall loue of God, and his vnchangeable decree of sauing some. For why? wee come to haue certaine expe∣ctation of life eternall by true faith, and the testimony of the Spirit of God, and that grounded on the promise of God, who is faithfull and cannot deceiue vs, vpon the deeds of Christ, together with whom (as many as truely beleeue) are quickned and raised,Ephes. 2.5.6. and made to sit in cer∣taine hope of heauenly possession, vpon the prayer of our Sauiour that could not be in vaine, but was heard of his heauenly Father:Ioh. 17.20.21 vpon the eternall loue of God, from which nothing can deuide vs:Rom. 8.39. vpon the vnchangeable de∣cree of God that stands fast for euer, sealed with this seale, the Lord knoweth who are his.2. Tim. 2.19. Let not then any enemy of Gods grace, thinke that hee is able to raze this foundation of comfort,A sure foun∣dation of cō∣fort to all true beleeuers. no, no, as many as truely beleeue, and haue the witnes of Gods Spirit, and the fruits of his grace, they haue a certaine and immouea∣ble hope of life eternall, & may reioyce with ioy vnspeak∣able and glorious as sayth the Apostle,1 Pet. 1.8. and be thankefull to God, for this inestimable gift, knowing this, that the
gates of hell shall neuer be able to preuaile against them. For concluding of the next point wee are to marke the phrase and forme of speech vsed by the Apostle, hee saith not, & loose not by carelesse negligence, but bee not mo∣ued away from the hope of the Gospell, this by necessa∣ry implication poynteth out the state and condition of such as haue certain hope of life eternall (namely) this that their hope shall at one time or other bee assaulted, there shall be euer enemies that will set vpon it, and labour to driue them from their hold, yea saith Luther,The hope of true beleeuers shall at one time or other be assaulted. as soone as  we lay hold vpon Christ by Faith, and certainly looke for saluation by him forthwith our enemies the worlde the flesh and the Deuill rise vp against vs hating and persecu∣ting vs most cruelly both in body and soule, and they vse their greatest skill, and bend their chiefest force, espe∣cially against our hope and expectation of life eternall. Hence it is,Ephes. 6.17. that the hope of true Christians is compared by the Apostle to an helmet, which as we know is a chiefe part of a Souldiers furniture prouided to defend his head, and put on to receiue blowes driuen against his head in which similitude is also implied one speciall reason, why the enemies of saluation doe chiefly set vpon hope, and la∣bour to moue vs away from our hope of eternall life, be∣cause therein they strike at the head, euen the head of all comfort, as the Apostle saith.1. Cor. 15.19. If in this life onely we haue hope in Christ, wee are of all men the most miserable. If our hope be confined to this life onely,Note. if our hope of eter∣nall life be cut off; then farewell all the comfort of a Chri∣stian, yea therein they strike at the head of all piety and re∣ligion, and constant continuance in the feare of God, for this it was that made Moses endure affliction without dis∣couragement,Heb. 11.27. his hope as an ankor was cast within the vail of heauen, and this indeed made the Martyrs passe throgh the fire with singing and reioycing, it was the Deuils drift in Iobs affliction to make him vtter wordes of blasphemy and distrust,Iob. 13.15. as appeares by Iobs constant resolution to the
contrary, if the Lord should kill mee, yet would I trust in him, yea further, the enemies of saluation labour most of all against hope,Despaire is a principall he∣resie. to bring to despaire, because that is a maine and principall heresie, it denieth God to be a Father, Iesus Christ a Sauiour, the holy Ghost a Comforter, yea, it denies the loue, the truth and the power of God, that God hath any loue to mankinde, truth in his word or power to performe his promise, and therefore no maruell though the enemies of true beleeuers bend their subtilty and strength against their hope of life eternall. And these things make it most plaine, that so long as the Diuell is the Diuell, a roaring Lyon, and thirsting after nothing more then the bloud of the Saints, our hope of life and salua∣tion shall neuer want enemies to assault it, but the Diuell will one way or other try, both his cunning by lies and errours and his strength, by violence to mooue vs away from our hope of life eternall, and therefore it behooueth as many as haue this hope euer to stand vpon their guard, to be ready armed and prouided against assaults,  and be∣fore the time of triall and assault come,They that haue hope of eternall life must bee euer prouided to withstand assaults. Psal. 119.116.117. euer to pray with Dauid, stablish me that in time of triall I bee not disapoin∣ted of my hope, stay thou me and I shall be safe, for if wee vpon our hope, of eternall life in time of health, and out of triall beginne to be quiet with our selues, if we beginne to bee secure and presumptuous, let vs be sure wee are not farre from danger. Wee must consider that there is in them that truely beleeue no such certainty of hope, as hath in it no wauering or doubting at all: no, no grace is euer for the time of this life mingled with the contra∣ry corruption, wee must remember that wee in regard of the infirmity of our flesh are wauering and stagge∣ring, and haue in vs cause of humbling: that so we may haue recourse to the Lord by prayer to be stablished in our hope, and then come hell, Diuell, flesh, or any enemie of our saluation, if the Lord staie vs we shall stand fast, and bee sure not to miscarry. Yea but will some say, the Lord
sometimes for the triall of the faithfull, in the very act of the assault, when Satan is laying siege to the consceience of true beleeuers, labouring by the sight of sin to driue to despaire, the Lord seemes to withdraw his hand and to hide his face, his loue and his mercy are so ouershadowed with the cloud of present affliction that they cannot be seene. What is to bee done in such a case, and how then shall a man bee able to hold out,  and not be driuen besides his hope of eternall life. To this I answere,  in such case and in such a time wee must first consider the Lords manner of working that hee then worketh not openly and sensibly, but secretly, that then hee hath his secret working for the suppor∣ting of his children, that they fall not quite away, and wee must then contrary to our owne sence and feeling, cleaue fast to his word and promise, euen to the bare word, when all other things for triall seeme contrary vnto vs, thus did Abraham as the Apostle sayth,Rom. 4.18. aboue hope when he had no reason to hope, then he hoped knowing the se∣cret power and working of the Lord. Againe, in such case wee are to thinke vpon the former and forepassed mercy of God towards vs, as Dauid sayth, when his Spirit was in perplexity, within him and his heart amased. He remembred the time past and medita∣ted in the workes of the Lord. Psal, 143.4.5. but heere will Satan lay before the conscience a stumbling block & tell a man in time of conflict, that in this respect his sinne is the greater and more grieuous, in that it hath been com∣mitted against so great mercy receiued, the greatnesse of mercy formerly receiued doth aggrauate his sinne, there∣fore to helpe our selues againe, and to repell and beat back also this assault, we are further to call to minde, and re∣member the examples of many seruants of God as Dauid, Peter, and such like. To whom the Lord hath remitted great sinnes com∣mitted
after great mercy receiued: And that wee may set before vs such examples for our comfort and the confirmation of our hope, it is plainely taught by the A∣postle Rom. 15.4. whatsoeuer things are written afore∣time, are written for our learning, that wee through pati∣ence and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope. And that the holinesse of such men should not hinder vs from looking on them for our comfort: Saint Iames makes it plaine in that particular of prayer, Iames 5.17. where hee sayth, the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much if it bee feruent: for example the prayer of Elias. Ob.Now some might say, Oh but Elias was a man indued with a rare measure of grace, and we are farre short of that holinesse that was in him, this the Apostle preuents, and sayth that hee was subiect to the like passions that we are, as if hee had sayd,  what doe you stand to reason against your selues, hee was subiect to the like passions that wee are, giuing vs to vnderstand that the holinesse of the man set before vs for example in Scripture, ought not to discourage vs from doing the like duety, or expecting the like comfort that hee receiued. Thus wee see how as many as haue hope of eternall life are to arme themselues to encounter the assaults of Satan layd against their hope, before the assaults they are to haue recourse to the Lord by prayer that in the power of his might they may bee able to stand, in time of the assault, they are to thinke on the Lords secret manner of working, and on his forepassed mercy towards them, and to call to minde the examples of Gods children, to whom hee hath remitted great sinnes after great mercy receiued. and that their ho∣lines ought not to discourage vs from looking for the like comfort that they receiued. One thing further wee may note from these words the Apostle sayth not, bee not mooued away from hope at large, indefinitely, but from the hope of the Gospell.
Whence it followeth, that the doctrine of the Gospell,  the doctrine of the remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by Christ,The doctrine of the Gospel only workes hope of eter∣nall life. is that only which works in vs hope & expecta∣tion of life eternall: it is not the Law that can bring foorth this effect, the Law properly worketh in vs no sauing grace of faith, hope, or the like: hence it is, that the Law is cal∣led a killing letter, and the Gospell only the word of life.2. Cor. 3. Acts. 5.26. and the word of saluation, Act. 13.26. and many other places might bee brought to prooue that the Gospell only worketh in vs faith in Iesus Christ, and certaine hope of life eternall. And first, this makes knowen that the hope of Papists is  no true hope, for their hope,Confutation of the Papists. as their owne words testifie is grounded vpon performance of those things God re∣quires of them, so farre foorth as they are able to do them, this hope is rather of the Law then of the Gospell, he that will ground his hope vpon performance of those things, God requireth of him, so far as he is able to do them, hath no reason in the world to hope for any good at Gods hand, for who is so blinded with selfe conceit and bewit∣ched with selfe loue that sees not how farre short he comes of doing that hee might doe, both in the estate of nature and grace to leaue them therefore, and to apply the point to our selues, is it so that it is the proper worke of the Gospell to bring men to certaine hope of life & saluation. Let vs then further meditate on this point to this pur∣pose,  we haue had by the mercy of God,Wee must looke that the Gospell haue the proper ef∣fect of it a∣mongst vs. the Gospell soun∣ding amongst vs many yeeres, let vs therefore looke that the Gospell haue the proper effect and worke of it a∣mongst vs in this particular, that it beget in euery one of vs a liuely hope of eternall life, euen a true hope, not proceeding from Satanicall illusion or presumpti∣on, such as is the hope of the greatest part in the world, but from good grounds from true faith in Christ, and from the testimony of his spirit, and from the fruites of it, looke that wee haue such an hope, for that is
the kindly and naturall worke of the Gospell. And that I may not barely propound this without enforcement by some reasons to moue vs vnto it, consider with me these  two. First, if the Gospell haue not wrought in vs some mea∣sure  of certaine hope of life eternall, we are yet (for any thing wee know) in no better state then the very damned Deuills in hell, for they know the story of the Gospell, ye they beleeue it to be true, yet so as they tremble, yea haue no comfort by it to themselues. Againe, if wee bee such as haue any hope, if wee bee as it were desperate persons vnder the Gospell, wee shall in time of triall bee most desperate, for as our Sa∣uiour sayth, if light become darkenesse, how great is that darkenesse? If that which is sweete in it selfe be∣come bitter to vs, how great then is that bitternesse? Come to experience in this, aske a desperate consci∣ence what comfort it findes in the doctrine of the gos∣pell the doctrine of remission of sinnes,Note. and wee shall finde it will answer, it is so farre from finding comfort in that, as nothing in the world doth more gall and grind it, and there is reason for it, because it hath no part in that comfort, it is the case of the damned in hell, their torments in hell are increased vpon them by the consi∣deration of the losse of the comfort in heauen, they are not onely tormented with paines of sence, but of losse, so such as are in a desperate state, vnder a sence and fee∣ling of Gods anger: their desperation and their discom∣fort is greater in consideration of the sweete comfort of the Gospell because they are perswaded it belongs not vnto them. If then we would not find our selues (for any thing wee know to the contrary, in the same state with the Deuill in hell, if we would not onely be hopelesse, but euen find our selues plunged (specially when the time of triall shal be) in∣to the depth of fearefull desperation, let vs be carefull now
while the Gospell is sounding in our eares in this day of saluation as the Apostle speakes,2. Cor. 6.2. that the Gospell may produce the proper fruit and effect of it in our hearts, that we may haue such an hope wrought in vs by the Gospell as shall neuer deceiue nor make vs ashamed, because the loue of God is shedde abroad in our hearts by the Holie Ghost. Come we to the next words (whereof ye haue heard) these words containe a specification of what Gospell the Apo∣stle meant in the wordes before (namely) that which yee haue heard preached by Epaphras, wherein as wee heard in the resolution of this verse is implied the meanes how the Colossians came to haue hope of life and saluation (name∣ly) by hearing the Gospell preached vnto them, the words in the original are thus, the Gospel which you haue heard; there is no difficulty in the words, for the sence they are to bee taken in the proper signification as they are laied downe. The Gospel which you haue heard, and that prea∣ched vnto you, for so much the words following giue vs to vnderstand. I passe ouer that which. I noted before vp∣pon the verie same wordes verse 5. the thing wee are hence to obserue for the ground of our instruction is this. That the Apostle is not content to say continue grounded and stablished in the Faith, and bee not mo∣ued away from the hope of the Gospell in generall, but hee adds further more specially, the Gospell which you haue heard: the generall conclusion that comes from  hence is this that one speciall cause of falling back from faith. of declining,One speciall cause of fal∣ling back and declining in a∣ny grace, is forgetfulnes of particular doctrin heard preached. in hope or any other grace is for∣getfulnesse of those particular things which wee haue heard preached vnto vs, when wee decline or decay in religion in the feare of God or in any other grace, it is by forgetting and letting slippe out of our mindes the particular doctrine which we haue heard and in former times receiued. Reu. 3.2, Our Sauiour exhorting the Angell
of the Church of Sardi, beeing fallen into a drowsie securi∣ty, to awake and strengthen the things which remaine, that are ready to dye, he sets downe this as the meanes and remedy vers. 3. remember therefore how thou hast recei∣ceiued and heard, and hold fast and repent, thereby ma∣king knowne vnto them, that forgetfulnes of things heard was the cause of their decay in religion, and the remem∣brance of them would be a meanes of repentance and re∣couery, the holy Ghost Hebrews 12. perswading to paci∣ence in time of affliction sayth, verse. 5. haue ye forgotten the consolation which speaketh vnto you as vnto children? For so the words are to be conceiued, as vttered with an interrogation haue ye forgotten?Heb. 12.5.6.7. then he brings to their remembrance a place out of the old testament, my sonne &c. whence it is cleare that we are to conceiue his speech as if he had thus saide,Pro. 13.11. you ought not to forget the com∣fortable word of exhortation, you haue heeretofore heard, and that hath beene taught tending to stablish your hearts and to make you stedfast, by remembring it, you may hee strengthened in paience, and by forgetting it, you shall finde the contrary effect, you shall faint in your minds, and not be able to hold out in time of triall. If therefore wee would not decline in faith, in hope, and goe backeward in grace and good things,  our due∣ty is that which the holy Ghost hath taught vs,We are to giue diligent heed to things heard and not let them slip out of our mind. Heb. 2.1. we are di∣ligently to giue heed to the things which wee haue heard that we be not retchles, and loose hearers, that the things heard, run not through vs. Many things taught are heard of some with delight, their minds seeme to bee rauished for the time with ioy at the hearing of them, as Christ saith of the Iewes, Iohn was a burning and a shining candle, and ye would for a season haue reioyced in his light, yet sud∣denly they slip away from them,Iohn 5.35. as if they had neuer heard them. This comes partly from the corruption of nature, and partly from the Deuill, heauenly things are so contra∣ry to our corrupt affections, that for them to abide in vs is
euen like fire and water to abide together, and the Deuill doth what he can to quench the light of them in our harts, and vtterly to race out the remembrance of them, and not to leaue any print of them, let vs then, knowing this cor∣ruption of our nature, and the working of Satan, labour with care and diligence to keep things heard and learned, let the remembrance of them be daily renued in vs by con∣tinuall meditation and thinking vpon them, and to helpe vs forward in this duty consider. First that by meditating and calling to minde things  heard, we come to the greatest measure of knowledge, yea to apply the doctrin taught more particularly to our selues then our teachers either do or can doe, because (if it please God to open our eies, wee are best acquainted with our owne estate, and can best apply the doctrine heard to our owne instruction and comfort, as a mans owne hand can better apply the plaister to his secret sore if hee will endure it, and take paines to doe it, then the hand of the most skilfull Chyrurgion, this no doubt was Dauids meaning when he said he was wiser then his teachers Psalm. 119.99. and hee makes this indeed the reason, for thy testimonies are my meditation. Againe consider that the doctrine of the word heard  truely preached, shall one day euen at the day of iudge∣ment bee that by which wee must bee iudged, by which all workes must bee tried as the Apostle saith, Romanes 2.16. at that day God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ according to my Gospell, if then wee doe not call to minde and remember things lear∣ned:Note. the doctrine heard shall at the day of iudgement bee a bill of inditement against vs, especially if wee heard it with delight, and afterward haue let it slip from vs it shall then leaue vs without all excuse, it shall bee a bill of inditement, and a fearefull sentence of condem∣nation against vs, and in consideration of these things let vs bee stirred vp to follow the councell of the wise man,
both to take fast holde of instruction,Pro. 4.13. and not to let it slip from vs, let vs keepe it fast and sure when we haue laid hold vpon it. Now to that which followeth. And which hath beene preached to euery creature which is vnder heauen, &c.) in these words is the first argument of preuention, where∣by the Apostle doth preuent an obiection of the Colos∣sians, they might say the Gospell wee heard was onely preached vnto vs by Epaphras our minister, and wee may doubt whether it be the true Gospell of Christ or no, this the Apostle preuents. First by this argument, that it was the same Gospell which was preached to all nations of the world, for so the words are to be conceiued, as appeares plainely by confe∣rence of those two places together Mark. 16.15.Interpreta∣tion. Mat. 28.19. by euery creature vnder heauen is meant all nations of the world. If any say, we read of certaine nations newly conuerted in latter times. Ob.I answer as before vers. 6. that is to bee vnderstood of the profession of the Gospell by publique authority, the Gos∣pell sounded foorth in the daies of the Apostles to all na∣tions, but it was not receaued by publike authority till the time of Constantine and Theodosius. The point I will ob∣serue from these words hauing spoken of the same in sub∣stance ver. 6. it shall be from the purpose of the Apostle in this place (namely) the preuenting of that obiection that the Gospell they heard was onely preached by Epaphras  whereas the Apostle doth preuent this obiection on this manner.That is the true doctrine of the Gospell that agreeth with the do∣ctrine of the Apostles preached to all the world. The Gospell you haue heard is the Gospell prea∣ched to all the world, hence I gather thus much. That indeede that is the true doctrine of the Gospell which is consonant and agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles preached throughout the whole world, vniuersa∣lity of doctrine, and generall ouerspreading of it, is not suf∣ficient to proue it to be true, (for so any heresie may bee
forced vpon men, vnlesse it consent with the doctrin prea∣ched to all the world, by the Apostles. Hence it is that Paul saith,Gal. 1.8.9. and hee doubles his speech that man or that Angel from Heauen must be accursed and held in extreame dete∣station, that shall teach any doctrin not only contrary but besides that we haue been taught and haue receiued from Paul and from the other Apostles. How shall I know that the doctrin now taught is agree∣able to that which the Apostles preached long since? Looke into the writings of the Apostles and Euangelists for there is not a sentence that euer the Apostles taught but for the substance of it,  it is written in the booke of the new Testament, it is but a shifting distinction of the Pa∣pists, that forsooth the first truth or Gospell is twofold, ei∣ther written and recorded in the booke of the new Testa∣ment, or vnwritten deliuered onely by word of mouth, for that which the Apostles taught and preached, the same (saith Iraeneus) by the will of God they afterward deliue∣red in writings, to be a foundation and piller of our faith. Yea but will some say againe, the writings of the Apostles are hard to be vnderstood. How shall we then know what doctrin is agreeable vn∣to them seeing the meaning of the holy Ghost,  in the wri∣tings themselues is hard to be found out. To this I answer: First,  all things in the writings of the Apostles are not hard, but onely some things, so sayth Pe∣ter 2. Epist. 3.16. things most needfull to be knowen and and beleeued to saluation, may come to bee knowen by diligent reading and hearing, attentiue marking, earnest prayer and iudging of them in humility, Againe, we must know there be two things specially ai∣med at in the writings of the Apostles. 1. The aduācement of the name & glory of Christ Iesus. And 2. the spirituall worship and seruice of God. Any man by diligent reading may obserue these two things principally driuen at in all the writings of the Apostles, and therfore that doctrine
is agreeable vnto them that setteth foorth Christ vnto vs with all due regard of his glory, in the worke of redemp∣tion and saluation, with due respect of the honour of his name as the onely King, Priest and Prophet of his Church, and doth vrge vpon vs spirituall worship and seruice of God standing in mortification of the flesh, newnesse of life and spirituall obedience. Thus wee may know what doctrine is agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles. For the vse of this poynt, I might shew the errour of many points of doctrine among the Papists, but I passe by that, let vs thinke vpon it to this purpose, is it so that tre doctrine is that which is consonant and agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostle preached many hundred yeeres agoe.We must not be disconten∣ted with do∣ctrine plainly deliuered be∣cause it is common. Then let vs take heed of discontment with doctrin plainely deliuered vnto vs, because it is common, and be∣cause we haue heard it many times before, for why? the same doctrine must still bee taught that was taught in the time of the Apostles, and that doctrine is onely good, it is the vanity of mans nature, not to be content with good things, because they are common and ordinary, but it is the worst kinde of discontent to be displeased with things pertaining to saluation,Note. it is worse then if a man should not like wholsome meat set before him to day, onely for this, because he fed on the same dish yesterday, to bee discon∣tent with the word, because we haue heard the same thing before, is the itching of the eare foretold by the Apostle▪ 2. Tim. 4.3. the time will come when they will not suffer wholsome doctrine, but hauing their eares itching, and the Apostle there sayth, this itching is found in them that follow their owne lusts. And let men take heed they fol∣low them not to their owne destruction, for it is iust with the Lord to harden our hearts, and to close the eyes of such as heare the word onely for fashion, and thinke them∣selues already aboundantly skifull. He hath sayd by the Prophet Isaiah 66.2. To him will I looke, and to him a∣lone
that is poore and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my words (that is humble in his owne eyes, receiuing the word with reuerence, hungring after it as the food of his soule, and saying in his heart as Samuel did,1. Sam. 3.10. speake on Lord for thy seruant heareth, (Whereof I Paul a a Minister) This is the second argument preuenting the former obie∣ction. The Colossians might haue made, the Gospell they had heard was the same Paul himselfe an Apostle preach∣ed, that which hence is to bee noted is briefely this, that Paul cals himselfe a Minister of the Gospell, wicked there∣fore and blasphemous are those scoffing speechesScoffing and blasphemous speeches a∣gainst the Ministers of the Gospell. of Har∣ding against Iewell, and the like many times belched out of the mouths of Papists and Atheists against the Ministers of the Gospell, your Minister-like talke, your Minister∣ship, &c. these blasphemies against the sacred name of minister, which the word so often vseth, as Saint Paul is not ashamed to take to himselfe) are against the word of truth it selfe. VER. 24. Now reioyce I in my sufferings for you, and ful∣fill the rst of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake which is the Church. In this verse we haue the second argument of the Apo∣stle perswading the Colossians to continuance in the faith, the argument is from the end of the Apostles owne suffe∣rings being prisoner at Rome, that hee suffered affliction for the confirmation of the Colossians in the faith and for the whole body of Christ which is the Church, this argu∣ment is amplified by the manner of his sufferings and the subiect of them. The manner, that it was with reioycing and the causes of that were two, first, because his portion was allotted vnto him, implyed in that word (fulfill) se∣condly, because his afflictions pertained to Christ, and were the rest of his afflictions (and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ) then hee makes knowen the subiect
of his suffering (namely) his flesh, these be the things g∣nerally comprised in this verse. Now to the words as they are lay downe by the Apostle,Interpreta∣tion. Gen. 3.1. & first of these words (No reioyce I in my sufferings for you) the word (Now) is not here a note of time but of transition, as now the serpent &c. ( my sufferings) that is in respect, or for my sufferings, a man may happily reioyce in time of suffering for some other thing, but the Apostles meaning is for, or in respect of hi sufferings for you (that is) for the confirmation of you in the doctrine of the Gospell, and the encouragement of you constantly to suffer for the Gospell, if you bee called vnto it. The first thing hence to be obserued is the argument of the Apostle, he makes his imprisonment and his sufferings for the Gospell, an argument of confirmation to the Co∣lossians, to perswade them to continue in the faith. Hence ariseth this generall conclusion, that the suffe∣rings of the Saints of God, especially of publike persons are not onely good and profitable to themselues,The sufferings of Gods Saints are profitable not onely to themselues but to others also. 2. Cor. 1.6. either for their owne triall, for the correction of things amisse in them, or as markes of their owne adoption, but vnto o∣thers, who either behold or heare of them, the sufferings the Saints of what kinde soeuer are profitable, not onely to themselues but to others also. The Apostle sayth whe∣ther we bee afflicted it is for your consolation and saluati∣on, which is wrought in the enduring of the same suffe∣rings which we also suffer, where wee see hee sets downe a double vse and profit of his afflictions, reaching beyond himselfe to the Corinthians (namely) their consolation and saluation, their comfort and their encouragement in the like sufferings, the Apostles afflictions were profitable to the Corinthians for their saluation, onely as a meanes and helping cause, and not as meritorious, but onely to helpe them forward in the way of saluation, for further proofe of this, consider the seuerall sorts of the sufferings of the Saints, they are either corrections of their sinne, tri∣als
of their faith of their obedience &c. or testimonies of their profession of the Gospell, as when they suffer as Mar∣tyrs, sealing their profession of truth, with the suffering of any torment, yea, to the shedding of their bloud in all these wee shall finde that their sufferings are not onely profitable to themselues, but to others also, as first their sufferings in way of correction are not onely meanes of good to themselues, but documents and warnings to others, to make them wary and carefull to auoyd the like sinne, thus were the sufferings of Dauid, after his sinne was pardoned. 2. Sam. 12.14. because hee was a publike person and by his sinne had opened the mouths of Gods enemies, hee suffered the losse of his childe, that by his suffering orhers might learne to take heede of the like sinne. Againe, their suffering in way of tri∣all are in many places of the Scripture set before vs, for for the working of patience in vs, Iam. 5.10.11. Take (my brethren the Prophets for an ensample of suffering aduersity and of long patience, which haue spoken in the name of the Lord, behold, yee haue heard of the patience of Iob, and haue knowen what end the Lord made. Last of all, their sufferings in way of testimony are no∣table meanes of confirmation and encouragemens of o∣others to the like sufferings, the storyes of the primi∣tiue times of the Church, are full of examples, it is ve∣ry memorable that is written in the Ecclesiasticall sto∣ry of the citty of Edessa, a city of Mesapotamia, Ruf∣finus lib. 2. cap. 5. it is there sayd when the Christians by the decree of the Emperour were banished all Churches they met in fields, which being espyed of the Emperour, in great rage hee strooke his chiefe cap∣taine with his fist, demaunding why he did not thence also driue them as hee had commaunded vppon this, his Captaine purposed the very next day to destroy them, yet his affections arising against so cruell
a fact, hee secretly lets flye abroad, that the next day hee would destroy all that were found at those meetings, ho∣ping thereby to warne them to abstaine from comming thither, but see the powerfull working of the bloudy per∣secution of those dayes for the confirmation of men in suffering for the trueth, the next day Christians, though before admonished of the danger, yet flocke thither in greater number then before, yea they runne headlong, & make hast as men afraid to come too late to suffer death, among the rest the captaine obserued a woman to runne with such hast out of her house, as that she neither stayd to shut her doore, nor to put on her cloathes as womanlike modesty required, and in her armes she carried a little in∣fant, when the captaine saw it; hee commaunded the wo∣man to come before him, and beeing come, he asked her whether shee made all that hast; into the fields (said shee) where the Christians meet. And hast thou not heard (said he) that the chiefe Captaine is going thither to put to the sword all that there he findeth; yes (said she) I haue heard it, and therefore I make hast that I may be there when hee comes: but what wilt thou doe with that little infant (said he)? Take it with me also (said she) that if the Lord will it may also be vouchsafed martyrdome: by this and many o∣ther examples that might be brought, it is most plaine that the sufferings of Saints in way of testimony, are notable meanes to incourage others to the like sufferings. And therefore for the vse of this point let vs not passe o∣uer the consideration of the sufferings of the Saints with∣out profit,Wee are to profit by our consideration of the suffe∣ring of Gods Saynts. let the saying be found true in vs in respect of other mens sufferings  let the afflictions of others bee our instructions, let their corrections warne vs to be more wary, and to bee more carefull to auoid the like sinnes, let their trialls build vs vp in patience, and ho∣ly obedience, and for the sufferings of the Saints in former times as Martyrs, wee are not to let the remembrance of them vanish & fall out of our minds without profit to our
selues: indeed will some say there is vse to bee made of the suffering of Martyrs, if wee should fall into the like times, they did, then by them we might be incouraged to the like constancy, and they might worke in vs like resolution. But what vse can we now make of them in the daies of peace? Very great good vse, they serue not onely to seale,  rati∣fie and confirme vnto vs, the trueth of that religion wee professe, (which is a notable vse,) but wee are further to thinke vpon them to this speciall purpose, they suffered losse, not onely of lands and goods, but of life also for the maintenance of the truth of the Gospell. Surely then the hearing of these their sufferings ought to make vs to forgoe the sensuall pleasures and profits of this world which cannot stand with the keeping of Faith, and good conscience, did the holy martyrs in former times suffer the losse of their liues by fire, fagot, and most exquisite torments, to maintaine the truth of the Gospell, and wilt not thou by their sufferings bee mooued to suffer the want of so much as a cup of beere or wine not needful, or the want of some carnall pleasure for the keeping of faith and a good conscience? it seemes it is not the same re∣ligion and Gospell now professed by thee, and heertofore maintained by them? yes surely, but thou art not the like affected professor of the same Gospell, it hath not yet the same powerfull working in thy heart: and know it for a truth, that if the sufferings of the Martyrs, they suffering losse of their dearest bloud, haue not thus farre profited thee, to moue thee to suffer the losse, and the cutting off of thy dearest sinne; thou hast not yet made a right vse of them, and certainely, as their sufferings were testimonies of the trueth and power of the Gospell, so they shall one day bee so many witnesses against thee, they shall bee as Abrahams prayer was for Sodome, sweet smelling sacrifi∣ces to God in themselues, but seruing for thy deeper con∣demnation; as Abrahams prayer was accepted of the
Lord, and yet Sodome was destroyed. Now reioyce I, &c.] not to say any thing of that, might hence be noted, that we are to suffer affliction with ioy, I stood on that verse 11. we are further to marke that Paul reioyced that his sufferings were for the good of the Co∣lossians, he was glad, and it did him good at his heart, that his sufferings were for their good. Hence I gather that  we are after his example to be glad and it must be the ioy of our hearts, if in any thing wee may doe good to the Church, and to our brethren: yea if wee may doe them good by suffering and by shedding of our bloud,We are to be glad if in any thing we may doe good to Gods Church though it bee to the shed∣ding of our bloud. wee are cheerefully to lay downe our liues for the glory of God, and for the furtherance of the saluation of our brethren, Iohn 4.34. we haue the example of Christ laid before vs, who tooke such delight in doing the will of his Father, as it was euen meat and drinke to him to doe it, the work of redemption, the conuersion and bringing of Gods chosen to the knowledge of their saluation, hee saith it was his re∣past, it was euen as meat and drinke to him, wee finde a worthy speech of the Apostle,Acts 20.24. hee saith though the holy Ghost did witnesse and let him vnderstand that bands and afflictions did abide him, yet saith he I passe not at all, nei∣ther is my life deare vnto my selfe, so that I may fulfill my course with ioy for the good of the Church of God,  the reasons and grounds of this are two. First, because wee are members of one mysticall body, and one member of the body is ready to helpe & do good to another, yea sometimes to suffer one for another as the arme suffers letting of bloud for the good of the head or the liuer, &c. Againe, because the good wee doe to our brethren the members of Christ it reacheth to Christ himselfe so sayth our Sauiour. Therefore looke with what cheerefulnesse we would do good to Christ (if it were possible to doe it to his owne person) with such alacrity wee are to doe it to our brethren,Mat. 25.40. yea to suffer, and shedde our bloud, if it
may be for their good, this being so that we are to reioyce and to make it the ioy of our hearts, if wee may do good to our brethren by suffering and shedding of bloud, then surely it followeth necessarily, wee are to reioyce to doe them good,  by the discharge of our duety in our publique place and office,We are to re∣ioyce in doing good to our brethren in discharge of our duty. wherein we come not so farre as to shed one droppe of our bloud, let this teach vs to shake off sloth and sluggishnes in doing publicke duties for the good of our brethren, any man may see it, that many that are in place and office to doe good to others, goe heauily and sleepily about publicke businesse, euery man almost is of such a leaden heart and heauy spirit in doing the due∣ties of loue to his brethren as the things done, when they are done, are neither pleasing to God, nor truly comforta∣ble to men. Therefore a little to awake and to stirre vp such men as are heauy hearted and drowsie in dooing ser∣uice by loue to their brethren, according to their place, cal∣ling and ability consider we these things.Motiues. First in doing good duties with cheerefulnesse wee are  like to the Lord himselfe who is said to reioyce in dooing good to his Church,Deut. 30.9. what better example then this to follow. Secondly thereby we testifie our communion with the  Church that we are members of it, that wee haue a fellow-feeling both of the good and of the afflictions of our brethren. And consider yet further, if our worke of loue bee  sluggish it is more then a probable argument wee are yet a sleepe in a carnall security, and doe but dreame of Christ and of the remission of our sins, for faith worketh by loue, and such as faith is, such will loue be,Gal. 5.6. and such as loue is we may gather faith to bee, if then we bee slothfull in perfor∣mance of the duties of loue to our brethren, it will seale vp vnto vs a fearefull conclusion, that our faith is indeed but a fancy, and our hope sutable, such as in the ende will con∣found and make vs ashamed.
If then wee desire to bee like the Lord himselfe: if wee would testifie our communion with the Saints of God, if we would not seale vp to our hearts that wee haue no true faith in Iesus Christ, and no sound hope of life and saluati∣on, let vs be moued to discharge publique duties that con∣cerne vs, and to doe seruice to our brethren with alacrity, with ioy and reioycing, let vs shake off immoderate loue of our selues,Note. which causeth men to make idols of themselues, to dreame of nothing but their owne good and profit, for that indeed makes a mans heart that it cannot be extended it is the mother of couetousnesse and many foule sinnes as appeares.2. Tim. 3.2. Now before we come to the causes that moued the A∣Apostle to reioyce in his sufferings, I will stand a while to remooue a misconstruction of this text, and false collecti∣on that is made by the Papists, from these words of the A∣postle, In that the Apostle saith (Now reioyce I in my suffe∣rings for you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodies sake the Church. Hence they gather and conclude. That the sufferings of the Saints are meritorious and satisfactory for themselues and others, and that the suffe∣rings of the Saints doe satisfie the iustice of God for tem∣porall punishment due, not onely for their owne sinnes, but also for the sinnes of others, which collection is full of contumely and blasphemy against the infinite merite and satisfaction of Christ his death and passion, I might shew the errour of this conclusion by many places of Scripture, the Apostle saith, 1. Corinth 1.13. was Paul cru∣cified for you, as if hee had saide, it is blasphemous once to thinke that either Paule or any other but Christ was crucified for vs, but that wee may easily see the weake∣nesse, and indeede the wickednesse of this collection:The weaknes & wickednes of a popish collection frō this verse dis∣couered. I will make it plaine and euident that it is repugnant and contrary to the words of this verse, & that this text which they bring as a strong argument, to prooue humane satis∣faction
is altogether against themselues. Reasons a∣gainst it. First therefore consider that when the Papists describe vnto vs, what bee their satisfactory punishments, then forsooth they reckon vp fastings, sackecloth, pilgrimages,  teares, continuall sighes, &c. yea they confesse that if in the outward actions of humiliation, inward greefe of heart be wanting, they are nothing worth, now mark how these words make against them. The Apostle saith heere in this text, hee was farre from any inward greefe in his sufferings, yea hee saith the contrary, that he reioyced, therefore doubtlesse the sufferings of Paule were among the sufferings which the Papists would haue to bee penall and satisfactory. Againe, sufferings satisfactory, such as must answere the iustice of God for sinne, must needs bee punishments for sinne, because there can bee no compensation or ex∣piation of sinne, but by punishment either in the party offending, or in some other in his stead, the curse bee∣ing annexed to the transgression of the Law, satisfaction must be made by punishment, yea the Papists themselues say that satisfactory sufferings are penall, they bee their owne words on this place (that is) they are punishments for sinne: now to say that the sufferings of Paul spoken of in this place were punishments for the sinne, either of him∣selfe or of others were most absurd it hath not so much as likelihood or shew of trueth, it is cleane against the text which makes knowne the Apostle suffered for the name of Christ, and for the maintenance of the trueth of the Gos∣pell, that is the argument of the Apostle, and so much is implied in the worde translated (fulfill) , vicissim impleo, I fulfill in the name of an other (that is) of Christ and so much also is expressed in that the Apostle calls his afflictions the afflictions of Christ, thereby gi∣uing to vnderstand that hee suffered in and for the name of Christ, for that is one reason why the sufferings of the Saints are called the sufferings of Christ, as saith
Peter 1. Epistle 4 14. reioyce in as much as yee are par∣takers of Christs sufferings &c. then verse fourteene, if yee bee rayled on for the name of Christ, blessed are ye, for the spirit of glory and of God resteth on you; which on their part is euill spoken of: but on your part is glorified; where hee makes it plaine that one reason why the sufferings of the Saints are called the suffe∣rings of Christ, is because they are suffered for the name of Christ, shall wee then say that the sufferings of Paul heere spoken of, were sufferings for sinne? it is most grosse, aliud est pati pro peccatis, aliud pro Christ. Thus wee see this very text which the Papists would force to maintaine humane satisfactions, it beares strongly against them. Ob.Yea but saith the Papists, by your leaue, the Apostle saith he fulfilled the rest of the afflictions of Christ, whence it is cleare (say they) that the sufferings of Christ and of his members make one masse or one body of sufferings, the sufferings of the Saints are the plenitude and fulnes of Christ his sufferings, and so by vertue of that vnion that is betwixt Christ and his members, their sufferings receiue influence and vertue from him to be meritorious and sa∣tisfactory. See the cunning of these men to deceiue the simple and their owne soules, it is true indeed that by reason of that Vnion that is betwixt Christ and his members, their sufferings are said to be the sufferings of Christ, and Christ to suffer in his members, and by the merit of his passion, their sufferings are accepted and rewarded, but that they are to be ioyned with Christ his sufferings in way of ment and satisfaction for sinne, that followes not from the vni∣on that is betwixt him and his members, for they are not one by personall vnion,Note. Christ and the Beleeuer are two distinct parts, now personall vnion is the ground of merit in Christ himselfe, for his manhood apart, and by it selfe meriteth nothing) but as it is receiued into personall vnion with
the Godhead, they must then prooue which they are ne∣uer able to doe) that we are receiued into vnity of person with Christ before their conclusion will follow that by vertue of our vniō with him, the suffrings of the Saints do merit and satisfie. Thus then we see the the error & weak∣nesse of that popish collection from this verse, that the sufferings of the Saints are meritorious and satisfactory. Come we to the causes that mooued the Apostle to re∣ioyce in his sufferings in these words (and fulfill it, &c.) the word translated (fulfill) as we haue heard, it signifies not onely to fill vp the measure, but to doe it in the name of another, & the Apostles meaning is, in the name of Christ (the rest of the afflictions of Christ) for the vnderstanding of these words,Interpreta∣tion. we must know that the sufferings of Christ are of two sorts, either such as he suffered in his owne per∣son for the redemption of his Church in way of satisfacti∣on for sinne and expiation of sinne, whereof the Apostle spake before in this chapter: or such as he suffereth in his members & in the whole Church to the end of the world, when his members suffer in way of conformity and simili∣tude with Christ their head, then Christ accompteth their sufferings as his owne, hence they are said to haue fellow∣ship with him in his afflictions, & to be conformable vnto his death, Phi. 3.10. and of this second sort, the words of the Apostle in this place are to be vnderstood (The rest of the afflictions of Christ) (that is) those afflictions that remain to be suffered in way of conformity with Christ (in my flesh) (that is) which are appointed vnto me to suffer in my bo∣dy, thus then we are to conceiue the words of the Apostle as if he had said, and fulfill vp that measure of affliction al∣lotted vnto me as a member of Christ, and remaining to be suffered by me in his name by way of conformity vnto Christ. The first thing we haue heere to marke is the word vsed by the Apostle, he saith not beare the rest, but fulfil, whence we may take vp this instruction.
That the afflictions of the godly, the members of Christ are measured out vnto them in the good prouidence of the Lord,The afflict ōs of the godly are measured out vnto them the good pro∣prouidence of God. when they are vnder affliction, they are filling vp of an appointed measure, how much or how little eue∣ry one shall suffer is appointed in the eternall councell of God, and it was not appointed that euery particular per∣son should suffer, all and euery sort of affliction, but that euery member in the body of Christ should suffer some in one sort and measure and some in another. Wee finde the truth of this in Iosephs affliction, Psalm▪ 105.19. it is said they held his feete in the stockes, and he was laid in i∣rons vntill his appointed time came and the councell of the Lord had tried him he was afflicted, but how much, or how long? euen so much and so long as the Lord had appointed, vntill his appointed time came. This also is cleare in the bondage of affliction of the Israelites in Ae∣gypt their affliction was measured and foretold,Gen. 15.13. and when the measure was full and the time expired, the selfe same day they were freed from it: howsoeuer there may seeme to be some difference of time mentioned in those two pla∣ces,Exod. 12.41. yet if wee reckon the 400. yeares from the birth of Isaak and 430. from Abraham his first comming into the land of Canaan, they are easily reconciled and proue the point in hand. And to this the seuenty yeares thing mentioned Ierem. 25.22. that also prooues as much. And thus I might go on from one example to another, and all meeting in this point deliuered that the afflictions of the godly are measured out vnto them in Gods good proui∣dence,  and the reason of this is manifest (namely) this not onely the euent and comming to passe of things is appointed of the Lord,  but also the circumstances of eue∣ry euent,We must not limit the Lord when we are vnder his hand in any afflictions. things not onely come to passe which God hath appointed, but as he hath appointed concerning the man∣ner and measure. How then is it so that the afflictiōs of the godly are mea∣sured out vnto them in the good prouidence of God then
we must learne, when wee are exercised vnder the hand of God, not to limite the Lord, not to appoint him, how much or how long hee shall afflict vs, not to bee con∣tent onely for a day or two, or while wee thinke good and then beginne to shake off the yoke of the Lord, but euen so long to endure the affliction with patience as he hath appointed, euer remembring that our affliction is measured out vnto vs by the good and gracious hand of God, euen by that hand that will bee sure to keepe mea∣sure and moderation (which is a notable comfort) so saith the Apostle, 1. Cor. 10.13. God is faithfull, and will not suf∣fer his children to bee tempted aboue that they are able, but will euen giue the issue with the temptation, that they may be able to beare it. Marke (I beseech you) the Apostle makes the Lords keeping of measure and moderation in afflicting of his children, no lesse sure then it is that God is faithfull, and can God bee vnfaithfull? If hee can, then thinke hee will exceed the measure of our strength in af∣flicting vs, if not, bee of good comfort, for so certaine it is that hee will keepe measure in our affliction, as hee is faithfull that can bee no other, a sweete foundation of comfort in the greatest affliction, ioyne to this the ex∣ample of the Israelites before spoken of Exod. 12.41. vers. Marke it, the Lorde did not breake with them one day, no not one houre, or minute of the appointed time of their deliuerance, and bee thou sure of it, that euen daies and houres of comfort fit for his children as they are knowne to the Lord, so are they alwaies ob∣serued of him most gratiously and most precisely, why then should we tye the Lord to our time and to our will, or else we faint, wee fall, we speake or thinke amisse, that the Lord regards vs not, hath forgotten vs and forsaken vs, or the like, learne neuer to doe it, let vs neuer thus wrong our good and gratious God, but let vs in time of our affliction pray that the Lorde would out of his mercy consider our strength, and according to his promise
lay no more vpon vs then hee will make vs able to beare and that hee would giue the issue with the affliction in doe time to his glory and our good. Ob.Now heere an obiection made by some occasioned from this doctrine is to be remoued, by some such as are deliuered out of trouble by meanes condemned in the word, (as by witches and wizards) may say and that true∣ly their measure of trouble was appointed of the Lorde, that so much they should endure and no more, and these beeing the meanes of their deliuerance, doubtlesse they were so appointed of the Lord, and therefore may lawful∣ly be vsed? To this I answere first, the parts of this obiection han  not together, they confesse them to bee meanes con∣demned in the worde, and yet would haue it that they may lawfully bee vsed, whereas things condemned in the word can neuer be lawfully vsed. Againe this is to make the secret will of God the rule of our actions, which is not knowne but by the euent, and therefore ought not to be the rule of them, but onely the will of God reuealed in his word. Lastly, whereas they say that such meanes were ap∣pointed of the Lord, it is very true, the euent reueal it, the Lorde did appoint to suffer such to bee the meanes, by his working permission out of his iust iudgement, not in his mercy, but as a curse to them, that are so deliuered,Note. and without their vnfaigned re∣pentance, for the further increase of their condemn∣tion, for as heeretofore I haue shewed, when as the meanes of getting health, wealth, &c. are euill, it is therefore reuealed that the Lord doth fully purpose o curse men, euen in those good things, and that is a heauy curse. The second thing we haue to marke is the next worde heere vsed (rest) the originall worde () signifieth the residue, remainder, hinder part or remnant, &c. that
which hence followeth is this, that the afflictions of the  members of Christ,The afflicti∣ons of the members of Christ are but as remnants in respect of his sufferings are but as small remnants and re∣liques of Christ his sufferings, What wee that are mem∣bers of Christ doe suffer, bee it to the shedding of our bloud by the sharpest and most exquisite torments that can bee deuised, yet it is but a remnant in comparison of Christ his suffering this wee shall finde confirmed by further euidence of Scripture, Isaiah, 63.3. I haue tro∣den the wine presse alone, and of all people there was none with mee. Sayth Christ of himselfe, the Euangelists set out in many words the bitternesse of Christ his suffe∣rings, as that his soule was heauy to the death, his cries strong, Oh Father if it bee possible let this cup passe from mee, his prayer was so vehement, his agony so great, that bloud for sweat burst out of his body. His com∣plaint was that hee was forsaken, an Angell was sent to comfort him, and these doe make it very plaine, that hee endured greater paines then euer did any, and that the afflictions of his members though they be martyred, yet are not comparable to his sufferings, they are but as a dram in respect of the infinite waight of paine layd vpon him, it is easie to make this further cleere by the strength of reason. As First,  God powred out vpon Christ the whole male∣diction and curse of the Law, due to the sinnes of all his chosen, and bestowed vpon him iustice without mercy, Galath. 3.13. hee was made a curse for vs; but in the affli∣ctions of his members, the Lorde doth moderate his anger, and in iustice remembers mercy, yea the curse is remooued from them according to that in the place be∣fore cited, Galathians 3.13. Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Law when hee was made a curse for vs. Againe, the Lord doth euer in wisedome proportion out affliction according to the strength of the afflicted, and the ende of their afflictions, hee knowing their
strength, and wherefore he doth afflict them, hence it is that hee sayth,Isay. 57.16. he will not contend for euer, neither well he be alwayes wroth. Now we must needs confesse that Christ his strength did farre surpasse the strength of any of his members, yea, of all his members, being God and man, he was able to endure the whole wrath of God, and the end of his suffering was satisfaction for sinne, and of theirs onely correction, triall or testimony in way of con∣formity to him, and so farre inferiour to the end of his sufferings therfore the afflictions of the members of Christ are not to bee compared to the affliction of Christ their head. And this being so, that the afflictions of the godly bee they neuer so grieuous, are but as a remnant in compari∣son of Christ his sufferings, then whensoeuer thou art affli∣cted,  learne to consider what Christ hath suffered for thee, when thou findest a little affliction,When we are afflicted wee must consider what Christ hath suffered for vs. a little paine in the least part of thy body so bitter, consider then what bitter∣nesse was in the whole sufferings of Christ, hee drunk the full cup of the bitternesse of Gods wrath, thou doest onely taste it, or rather not so much as taste of it, to teach thee to consider what Christ hath suffered for thy redemption, and that this consideration may be more profitable, learne to extend it a little further after this manner, happily thou art pained with the gout, the stone, the wind cholicke the tooth-ach, or some such grinding and griping paine, and to bee eased thou canst be content to wish thy selfe out of the world; let this lead thee to consider the infinite paine and torment of Christ his sufferings, and wtthall consider thine owne sinne, by which thou doest adde and put new passions vpon Iesus Christ, for thy sinne doth in a second degree torment him againe, wilt thou confesse that the paine of a tooth is so great, that in regard of it thou coul∣dest wish with all thy heart to bee out of the world to bee eased of that paine,Note. and yet wilt thou not sticke by thy sinnes, to adde new torments to Iesus Christ, whose tor∣ment
once farre exceeded the greatest paine and torment thou canst possibly endure; this is most sauage and brutish cruelty, yea, such as is beyond all the degrees of compa∣rison, matchlesse cruelty, wilt thou (as much as in thee is) adde torments to him that shed his bloud for thee, and suffered the extremity of Gods wrath for thee, if men when they are pained, would bee led forward by that paine to behold the bitternesse of Christ his painefull passion, and withall, that their sinne is a further degree of torment vn∣to him, doubtlesse it would make them (if hell haue not full possession of their hearts) carefull to auoyd sinne, yea, it would take from them all colourable excuses, common∣ly fetcht from the Diuels store-house, as that they are not alone, that they are prouoked and drawen on by compa∣ny and the like, the swearer and the drunkard will plead that they forget themselues, that they are carried away with company; and wilt thou so forget thy selfe, & so run on with company, posting and making haste to hell, and againe peirce the sides of Iesus Christ? wilt thou (as much as in thee is) heape new passions vpon him? Oh remem∣ber the bitter passion of Iesus Christ, and learne to bee reformed. Againe, are our afflictions wee being members of Iesus  Christ, but as a remnant in comparison of his sufferings then let this serue as a checke to that secret thought some∣times rising vp in the heart of Gods childe afflicted, yea, sometimes breaking out into this speech, that neuer was any in the like case that he is in,A checke to that secret thought ari∣sing in the heart of Gods childe affli∣cted that ne∣uer was any in the like case that he is in. neuer was any so greeuou∣sly afflicted as he is: thus was it with Iob 6.2.3. hee com∣plained his griefe and misery was heauier then the sand of the sea. Thus the Church in great distresse calles to them that passe by the way to behold and see if any sorrow bee like vnto her sorrow. If such a thought enter into thine heart in time of bitter affliction, learne to checke it by this,Lam. 1.12. looke vpon the bitter passion of Christ, and remember that the waue or billow of Gods wrath did light vpon his
head, and all that thou doest suffer is but a flash of water breaking off from that waue or billow: but heere the Di∣uell hath found out a shift when a man comes to some that are afflicted, and sets before them the bitternesse of Christ his passion, and tels them they ought to looke vpon that, and to remember that their affliction is nothing in compa∣rison of his sufferings. To what end (say they) doe you set before vs the bitter∣nesse of Christ his sufferings, are we or any liuing, who are but meere men able to beare that hee was able to endure, who was God and man: Thus the Diuell doth shift his foot, and is ready to suggest, to trouble the minds of such as are weake in time of affliction, and to make them thinke or speake amisse. I answer  vnto it, it is true, thou art not able to beare what Christ endured, but thou must remember what be∣fore was deliuered, that the Lord doth therfore proporti∣on out thine affliction accordingly, and withall, that which makes sufferings hurtfull, I meane the curse, is remooued from thee if thou be in Christ, but if thou wilt yet further insist vpon the measure of thy paine, that neuer any mēber of Christ suffred the like, reason wil euince the contrary, e thine own conscience must of force acknowledge it to be otherwise, for if God lay no more vpon any of his children then they by him are enabled to beare, and thy strength when it is the greatest, without question, is farre inferiour to that of Iob, of Abraham, of Dauid, &c. men eminent and endued with a great measure of strength, then cer∣tainely, their paine and affliction was greater then thine, and thou art not tried and afflicted like one of them. It followeth (the afflictions of Christ) In that the Apostle calles his afflictions the afflictons of Christ, I might stand to shew that the afflictions of the members of Christ reach vp to Christ himselfe, which may strike amazement and terrour into all that wrong them, and may comfort them that are wronged with assurance that the Lord Iesus will
not suffer himselfe long to be pinched in his members, he hath experience of their miseries, and hath learned to be compassionate towards them, but this I haue handled at large verse 15. and let mee adde onely thus much  vnto it, that the Lord Iesus doth know and acknowledge his members in their greatest distresse,The Lord Ie∣sus doth know and ac∣knowledge his members in their grea∣test distresse. their affliction cannot deuide betwixt him and them, and make him hide his face from them: the Lord calles the Israelites his people, when they were plunged in their deepest distresse, Exod. 3.7. and in many other places of this booke,  the Lord is not like the proud people of the world,The Lord therefore is not like the proud people of the world. who know a man in a gay coate or high place, but in pouertie and basenesse will not vouchsafe to looke vpon him though hee be most neare vnto them in bloud and kindred, it is not so with the Lord, but in the poorest plight, when the backs of his children are bare for want of cloathing, their faces leane, quite altered with brinish teares, that haue worne furrowes in them, their heads hang down for griefe, & all their bones are disioyn∣ted with racking tortures of bloudy tormentours, euen then doth the Lord know and as graciously acknowledge them for his owne, as he did in their prosperity and chiefest outward comfort. If we further follow in our meditations it will minister vnto vs matter of sweet comfort. Come we to the last thing to bee stood on in this verse in these words (in my flesh) The Apostle doth heere re∣straine his sufferings spoken of to his owne person, and withall doth point out the subiect of his suffering, that hee being now in prison, his body was afflicted, that wee may  hence obserue is this.The persecu∣tors of the Church n onely wch the  of Go ∣dre ▪ That the persecuting enemies of the Church and of the members of Christ can go no further then the body, they cannot come to the soule to hurt that, the soule is free from the rage and violence of all Satans instruments as our Sa∣uiour hath taught, Mat. 10.28. Obiection.O▪ But will some say they can make men abiure
and renounce Christianity as the Turkes doe at this day? That abiuration is but like rauing in some extremity of sickenesse, it is forced and may be where the seed of grace remaines still in the heart, as a childe of God in some ex∣tremity of sicknesse may shew exceeding strange, yea, fran∣ticke behauiour,Note. and so die, and yet goe to heauen, and we are not by any outward thing in this life or death, to iudge of his estate before God, so a true Christian may be forced to abiure Christianity, and yet still remaine a true Christian, all the Tyrants in the world are not able to hurt his soule. Let this for the vse of it teach vs that which our Saui∣our hath taught Luk. 12.4. not to feare them that are on∣ly able to kill the bodyWe are not to feare them who can only kill the body. but cannot kill the soule, and for our further encouragement heerein, consider but this one thing, are we the children of God and members of Christ, then the Lord hath deliuered vs from the power of sinne and Satan, and the bondage of vnruly lusts, which are ene∣mies to our soules and saluation, and is not he then able, and also willing in his good time to free vs from weake men, who can onely touch our flesh? yes doubtlesse, let vs make no question of it, but remember it and be strengthe∣ned in the time of need. VER. 25. Whereof I am a Minister according to the di∣spensation of God, which is giuen me vnto you ward, to fulfill the word of God. These words are a further amplification of the Apostles second argument, and containe in them, first a reason of the Apostles suffering for the Church, because hee was a Minister of the Church (Whereof I am a Minister.) Then secondly, a limitation of his Ministry, in respect of his Ministeriall charge, that he was appoynted a Mini∣ster of the Iewes, but of the Colossians and the rest of the
Gentiles in these words, according to the dispensation of God which is giuen me vnto you ward, wherein we haue three ma∣terials to be considered. First, his Ministry which hee calles a dispensation of God. Secondly, how that was conferred vpon him that it was giuen him. Thirdly, the speciall reference and relation of it, vnto you-ward. Then followes the end of this dispensation thus giuen vnto him in the last words (to fulfill the will of God) Come we to the words as they are layd downe by the Apostle, Whereof I am a Minister (that is) of which Church I am a Minister: I might heere vrge it against the Papists, that the Apostle explaines himselfe how hee suffered for the Church, not as a Mediatour betweene God and the Church, but as a Minister of the Church, not to satisfie for others, but to minister to their faith by confirmation and strengthening of it, by his example and patience, but of this we spoke before in the former verse. Obserue we, that the Apostle saith, hee was a Minister of the Church, the body of Christ; hee sayth not that hee was a Minister at large, the word Minister being a word of relation, but hee sets it downe with this correlatiue the Church, that his ministery had speciall reference to the Church of Christ, and to the true members of Christ, and not to any other; Hence ariseth this poynt of instru∣ction. That the outward ministery of the Word and Gospell is  ordained of the Lord properly for the good of the ChurchThe outward Ministry of the word is ordained properly for the good of Gods Church. and with speciall respect to the true members of Christ, ei∣ther actuall or in Gods election, all ministeriall actions, as preaching the Word, administring the Sacraments and the like, haue speciall relation to the good of Gods chosen, and this poynt is plainely propounded and layd before vs by the Apostle,Ephes. 4.12. together with a reason of it in the verse be∣fore,
that to this end Christ ascending gaue gifts vnto men, some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Euangelists, and some Pastours and Teachers for the ga∣thering together of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edification of the body of Christ. The ground of this is the order which the Lord hath made knowen that he holds in bringing of his chosen to life & saluation, that whom he hath predestinate, them he doth in time effectually call, & the ministry of the Gospell is by him appointed an instrument and meanes of effectu∣all calling, by the preaching of the Gospell, men are cal∣led: Now effectuall calling properly belongs to the cho∣sen of God, and therfore the ministry and meanes of sal¦uation hath proper reference to the good of Gods chosen. Ob.But will some say, the word is to be preached to all, the commission was generall, goe teach all nations, Mat. 28.19. and preaching is not limitted in respect of the flocke committed to any mans charge? Answer.  It is true, the Minister of the Word is to preach to all to whom hee is sent presuming in the iudgement of charity that all his hearers bee the Elect of God leauing secret iudgement to God, but yet the outward mi∣nistry and preaching of the word serues properly for the calling, and conuersion, and confirmation of Gods chosen & the reprobate are made partakers of externall vocation only accidentally, because as tares and chaffe are mingled with good corne, so they are among Gods chosen, it serues as an occasion (by reason of their corruption) of their har∣dening and to leaue them without all excuse, it is to the chosen of God the sauour of life to life euerlasting, but to others the sauour of death to their deeper condemnation. 2. Cor. 2.16.Now the application of this point might bee to teach the wicked, how much they are beholding to the chosen of God,Note. for whose sakes they are partakers of the sound of the Gospell, which sometimes worketh restraint in them from the outrage in sin though no renouation, & so their iudgement
shall be the easier in that respect, yea the continuance of the world is for the sake of Gods chosen, when their num∣ber is full then shall the end be But let vs rather thinke vppon this doctrine to this purpose, it is so that the ministery of the worde by man, is appointed proper∣ly for the good of the body of Christ,  this then may serue as a ground of examination and triall to euery one of vs, whether we be true members of the church of God or no,Triall of our selues whe∣ther we be true members of the Church or no. hereby we may know it, the Ministery of the word is or∣dained for the good of Gods chosen. If then thou receiue good by it, it is a sure signe of electi∣on to life and saluation; it is the mark Christ himselfe hath set vpon his sheepe;Ioh. 10.27. they heare his voyce sounding in the ministery of the Gospell, and they follow it, they are bettered by it: but if thou eyther wilt not heare it, or hea∣ring it carest not to follow it; but a drunkard before, a drunkard still, filthy before, and filthy still, a worldling before, and still deuoted to the things of this earth, and minding earthly things, to what fold thou doest belong, thy selfe and others may easily iudge, surely to the folde of goates, not of sheepe. To driue this a little deeper, that this may profit & moue thee hereafter to a further profiting by the ministry of the Word, consider these two things. First, if the Minister would gain & gather thee to God and thou refuse, thou must know that thy wilfull refusall to be gained and gathered, is the immediare forerunner of iudgement, and of thine owne destruction, and there is reason for it, God hath so threatned, Prou: 1.27. Zach. 7. From ver. 11. to the end, and it is a resistance of the spirite of God,Acts 7.51. and it is the ripenesse and full growth of sinne to hate to be reformed:Mat. 23.37. Marke what Christ himselfe sayth, as hee was a Minister of Circumcision, hee would haue gathered them together, but they would not, therefore their habitation should bee left vnto them desolate.
Againe, hee that will not now heare the minister of the worde, speaking in the name of the Lord, or heares him without regard to take good by him, as those the Prophet Ezekiel speakes of chap: 33.31. let him know the day shall come when his eares shal heare, (wil he, nill he) that which shall make his heart ake, goe thou cursed into euerlasting fire, prepared for the Deuil and his Angels, let these things stirre thee vp to thinke vpon it, how thou dost profit by the ministery of the word, and assure thy selfe Gods pur∣pose cannot be frustrate, if thou belong to him, his mini∣ster is sent for thy good, and thou shalt receiue good by him, if not thou shalt be hardened in thy sinne and heape vp wrath against the day of wrath. Come wee to the Apostles limitation of his ministery in regard of his ministeriall charge in these words (accor∣ding to the dispensation of God. Which is giuen mee vnto you-ward) the words heere translated (Dispensation of God) are not to bee taken as sometimes they are vsed,Interpreta∣tion. for the pro∣uidence of God as we vse to say, by the mercifull dispensa∣tion of God (that is) by his good prouidence, because the prouidence of God cannot be giuen, as the Apostle saith, that this dispensation was, but they are to bee conceaued as the originall wordes doe signifie, according to Gods stewardship, (to you-ward) (that is) in respect of you Co∣lossians and the rest of the Gentiles as wee haue it, Gala∣thians 2.7. The first thing we haue heere to marke is, that the Apo∣stle calls his ministery a stewadship giuen of God. Hence we see that the minister of the Gospell, lawfully  called to that office is Gods steward,The minister of the Gospell lawfully cal∣led to that of∣fice is Gods Steward. he is set ouer the hous∣hold of God, his Church as a steward ouer some great fa∣mily, hence it is that Paul saith to Timothy: these things write I vnto thee, that thou maist yet know how thou oughtest to behaue thy selfe in the house of God, and in his Epistle to Titus 1.7. in expresse wordes, a Bishoppe or Minister is Gods Steward,1. Epist. 3.14. yea hee would haue all men so to esteeme
of them, let a man so thinke of vs as of the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God.1. Cor. 4.1. Where the Apostle al∣so so makes knowne what bee the things committed to the Ministers of the Gospell to dispense and dispose of (name∣ly) the secrets of God (that is) the doctrine of the Gospell, which is a secret and a mistery hid from the eyes of the world, (so called by the Apostle in the next verse of this chapter) and the doctrine of the Gospell being the word of reconciliation publishing remission of sins to all that truly beleeue it, & repent of their sinnes, hence it is that the mi∣nisters of the word are said to haue the ministery of recon∣ciliation committed vnto them, and as stewards to haue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,2. Cor. 5.18. to open or to shut heauen according to the condition propounded in the Gospell (that is) to declare and pronounce remission of  sins, to them that beleeue and truly repent,Mat. 16.19. and that Gods mercy is shut vp from them that are vnbeleeuers and vnre∣pentant, thus are the ministers of the word, Gods Stew∣ards to dispose of his secrets after his will, and good reason that his will onely should rule in his owne house. And therefore for the vse of this in the first place the ministers of the word must take notice of it, that they haue onely as the stewards of God, the ministery of reconcili∣ation to declare to the penitent remission of their sinnes, and not power to forgiue sinnes,Ministers of the Gospell haue only as stewards the ministry of reconciliati∣on to declare to the peni∣tent remission of sinnes, and power to for∣giue sinnes. as that man of sinne the Pope doth challenge to himselfe, who in his blasphemous  pardons takes vpon him to forgiue both poenam & culpam punishment and sinne,When the mi∣nister of God pronounceth remission of sinnes to the penitent and shuts vp Gods kingdome a∣gainst the im∣penitent, it is as if God him∣selfe should doe it. and the ministers of the word haue onely the keyes of ministery in respect of Christ whose stewards they are to open and shut according to the wil of their master reuealed, & not at their owne will & pleasure. A second vse of the doctrine now deliuered may be this is the minister of God, Gods Steward to dispose of his se∣crets according to his will, surely then when the Mini∣ster doth so, when hee doth pronounce remission of sins to the penitent, and shut vp the kingdome of heauen and
Gods mercy from the impenitent, let vs learne to account it, as if God himselfe should doe it; for hence it is, that the Ministers of the Word are said to remit or retain sins, because they declaring by the Word remission of sinnes to the penitent,Ioh. 23.23. and retaining of sinnes to the impenitent, it is as certaine, as if God himselfe should pronounce it from heauen: it is said Exod, 14.31. the people belee∣ued the Lord and his seruant Moses, giuing vs to vnder∣stand, that though faith respect God onely, yet is there such an Vnion betwixt him and his Ministers, as indeed and truth we cannot beleeue him vnlesse we also beleeue his Ministers, speaking from him, let vs therefore thinke vpon it, and especially when they shut vp the kingdom of heauen, when they denounce the iudgements of God against vs for any sinne, euery man will bee ready to take holde of the Word of mercy, and esteeme that as the Word of God himselfe, but in the word of threatning and denouncing of iudgement, men make a diuision be∣tween God and his Minister: let vs take heed of this, and know for a conclusion of this point,Note. that if we diuide be∣tween God and his Minister in the word of threatning, the Lord will punish vs in the same kind, hee will diuide be∣tweene him and his Minister in respect of vs in the word of mercy, and in his iust iudgement he will make his word of mercy, but as the word of man vnto vs, it shall bee vn∣profitable vnto vs, wee shall finde no true comfort by it; re∣member the example of Herod, he deuided between God and Iohn in the word of threatning for his sinne, and the Lord made all that he heard from Iohn, euen the thinges that he heard gladly to be vnprofitable vnto him hee liued and died in his sins. Now to the second Materiall2 Materiall. in the Apostles limitation how this dispensatiō was conferd vpon him in these words (which is giuen me) the words are plain, & are to be taken in their proper signification which is freely or of Gods grace bestowed vpon mee, in that the Apostle sayth his
ministery and dispensation in the Church of Christ was giuen him, it pointeth out first this generall instruction,  that no man is to vndertake that office & function to be a minister of the word & publike dispencer of Gods secrets,No man ought to vn∣dertake the of∣fice of a Mini∣ster of the word vnlesse it be giuen him of God. but he to whom it is giuen of God, (that is) hee that is in∣wardly called of God, furnished with competent measure of gifts, both of mind & wil for the discharge of that office and hath also outward approbation of the Church, and for this there be many reasons. First, because it is Gods order appointed in his Church,  that hee that is to teach should by him be called, and sent, Rom. 10.15. Secondly, the ministery is Gods, and not mans, & ther∣fore  ministers must be sent and deputed of the Lord. Thirdly, vnlesse they be sent of God they cannot ga∣ther  assurance of Gods speciall protection and assistance in their calling which is necessary for them. The vse  of this may bee to discouer the error and fancy of the Anabaptists and their followers,Confutation of an Anabap∣tisticall fancy. who thinke that a∣ny man vpon a priuate motion may step forth and vnder∣take the duety of a publike teacher, and may preach and expound the Scriptures, and they alleadge for themselues that such motion is from the spirit of God, but (indeed) it is rather from another spirit euen from Satan & from their owne pride and vanity, & it is an opinion foolish and fan∣tasticall, I will spend no more time in confutation of it. We are to marke that the Apostle speaking of his mini∣stry and stewardship in Gods house, an eminent office, & of excellent dignity, hath an eye to the first cause and fountaine of it, that it was giuen and bestowed vpon him,  that it descended vpon him from the meere grace & mer∣cy of God. Hence wee are taught, that in all the good things of this life we enioy,In all the good things of this l fe we doe eniy, we are to look vp to the giuer of them. be it dignity, office in the Church, or in the common-wealth, be it health, wealth, liberty, credit, stocke or store, wee are to lift vp our eyes to the hills from
whence any of these good things come downe, we are to looke to the fountaine whence our streame hath issued, e∣uen to the meere grace and mercy of God, wee find it was common and frequent with our Apostle thus to look vp∣ward to the author and giuer of euery good gift, 1. Cor. 15.10. by the grace of God, I am that I am. Ephes. 3.7.8. hee sayth hee was made a minister of the Gospell by the gift of the grace of God, euen to me the least of all Saints is this grace giuen that I should preach among the Gen∣tiles the vnsearcheable riches of Christ,Gal. 1.15. that he was called by the grace of God, this was commendable in the Apo∣stle, and is woorthy our imitation, and it is a duety of great good consequence. First, it worketh true thankfulnesse,This duty practised wor∣keth in vs first thankfulnesse. Secondly hu∣mility. 1. Cor. 4.7. nothing is more effectuall to draw out thanks for good things receaued of men then to know the things giuen to bee meere gratuities aboue desert, and meerely from the bounty of the giuer. Againe it is a notable meanes to humble vs, shall wee know the good things wee haue are receaued from the meere grace of God, and shall we then be proud of them? it is the Apostles conclusion, what hast thou that thou hast not receiued, and if thou hast receiued it, why reioycest thou, as though thou hadst not receiued it? let vs remem∣ber this duty,Note. and the rather because it is the corruption of our nature to rest in the things giuen and to forget God the Author and giuer, to eat the bread, and not to see God in the bread as saith Luther. Moses knowing this inborne corruption,Deut. 6.12. giues this caueat, beware least, &c. and this corruption was growne to full ripenesse in Nebuchadnezar Dan 4.27. is not this great Babell that I haue built for the house of the kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the ho∣nour of my maiesty?Motiues stir∣ring vs vp to the practise of this duty. and wee know what followed he was driuen out from men to liue with beasts. Let vs take heed God deale not with as he dealt with him, wee may iustly feare it, if we haue not hearts to see and consider the mer∣cy  and free grace of God in the good things vouchsafed
vnto vs, that hee will driue vs out among beasts (that is) in his iust iudgement giue vs the hearts of beasts, hearts ta∣king sensuall delight in those things we enioy, euer groue∣ling vpon them, and not able to lift vp themselues, towards which is an heauy iudgement. And consider we further whence it is that men see not  Gods mercy in outward good things, surely because they see not his fauour towards them in Christ, in whom right to all the creatures is restored, and by whom only sweet∣nesse is found in blessings,1. Cor. 3.21.22 23. and out of them they are but curses, it is not possible that a wicked man who finds not Gods grace in Christ, should see his mercy in outward things, for (indeed) they are not giuen to him in mercy, but in iudgment, as his portion, and as witnesses of his vn∣thankfulnesse, as it is said, God left not himselfe without witnes in doing good, giuing raine and fruitful seasons, fil∣ling our hearts with food and gladnes, and to leaue him without excuse. If then we would not (by the iust hand of God) be giuen ouer to liue as bruit beasts amongst men, feeding and fat∣ting our selues with Gods blessings, and wanting eyes and harts to see and consider his mercy in them, if wee would not proue to our selues & against our selues that we see not Gods grace in Christ, let vs learne to raise vp our thoughts to see Gods grace and mercy in the outward good things of this life giuen, and bestowed vpon vs that so wee may be thankfull to him for them, and vse them not to riot ex∣cesse, brauery, and to set out, and to magnifie our selues a∣boue others, but to the glory of him that gaue them, and to the good of our selues and others. It followeth (vnto you-ward) in these words we haue the  third materiall in the Apostles limitation (namely) the spe∣speciall  reference of his ministery, and the meaning is,Pauls Apo∣stleship had speciall relate to the Gen∣tiles. in respect of you Colossians, and the rest of the Gentiles, that which I will hence obserue shall be this. That the ministery and Apostleship giuen to Paul had
speciall relation to the Gentiles, yea hee was appointed by speciall vocation the chiefe Apostle of the Gentiles, as Pe∣ter was of the Iewes; it appeares plainely Gal. 2.7. and wee find it in many places of the acts, that Pauls commission was specially to preach to the Gentiles,  as Acts 4.9. If any say the commission of the Apostles was generall,  it is true,Acts 13.2. Acts 26.17. this power and liberty was giuen, yet afterwards it pleased the Lord in wisedome for good causes to order it by a second decree, that Paul should specially haue care of the Gentlies, I say specially, for though Paule (occasion being offered) preached to the Iewes, they being dispersed among the Gentiles, yet was he still the chiefe Apostle of  the Gentiles. How then can the Papists deriue the prima∣cy and supremacy of their PopeAgainst the supremacy of the Pope. from Peter, the Scripture is plaine that Peter was not chiefe Apostle of the Gentiles, therfore admit the Pope to be his successor, and to haue his authority (which no wise man wil grant being Aposto∣lical) yet cannot be thence deriue his authority and power ouer the Gentiles, they might more probably conuey his title of supremacy from Paul, then from Peter, and indeed beeing driuen from this by plaine euidence of Scripture, they would craftily seeme to deriue their Popes authority from both Peter and Paul which is but a meere shift, if they hold their owne principles it is impossible. In the last words of this verse (to fulfill the word of God) we haue the end of the Apostles ministery, that hee was a minister of the Church to fulfill the word of God, by the word of God we are heere to vnderstand the Gospell as ap∣peares in the next verse,Interpreta∣tion. and to fulfill it is to publish and to preach it and the preaching of the Gospell by the Apostle is called a fulfilling of it, because by it the Gentiles were called as was foretold by the Prophets, and that worke be∣ing wrought & fulfilled on them by the preaching of the Gospell, the preaching of it is called a fulfilling of it. That which hence is offred to our consideration is from the forme of speech heere vsed, the Apostle saith not to
preach the Gospell but to fulfill it hence followes this con∣clusion. That the Gospell truely preached is not an empty word,  The Gospell truely prea∣ched is not an empty word. 2. Cor. 3.8. Gal. 3.2. but a word filling those that belong to God with grace and goodnesse, and the true preaching of it is powerfull to that purpose. Hence it is that the Apostle calles his preaching of the Gospell, the ministration of the spirit, hee sayth the Gala∣thians receiued the spirit by the preaching of the Gospell and heerein lies a principall difference betweene the Law and the Gospell. The Law doth not minister the spirit, but by the preaching of the Gospell the spirit is giuen. This must teach vs to make a precious account of the preaching of the Gospell,  We are to make preci∣ous account of the prea∣ching of the Gospell. 2. Tim. 3.15. which hath with it (in them that belong to God) the operation of his spirit, and is powerfull to bring them from ignorance to knowledge, from dark∣nesse to light, from the power of Satan to the glorious li∣berty of the sonnes of God, and to make them wise to sal∣uation, and let vs looke on our selues in our naturall con∣dition before the preaching of the Gospell hath wrought vpon vs, what are we? surely, blinde and ignorant of the wayes of God, walking in the darknesse and vanity of our mindes, rushing into errours, breaking out into blasphe∣mies, running into all sorts of sinne, yedding to the sug∣gestions of Satan, embracing the vanities of the world, fol∣lowing the swindge and corruptions of our owne hearts, and lying open to the wrath and and iudgements of God, these things ought to mooue vs to make speciall account of the Gospell preached, which doth in as many as it is powerfull, informe the iudgement, reforme the will, order and sanctifie the affections, and bring into captiuity euery thought to the obedience of Christ. The Gospell preached giues the Spirit,Note. the Spirit be∣gets Faith, Faith apprehends Christ, and Christ brings sal∣uation, therefore make precious accompt of the preaching of the Gospell.
VER. 26. Which is the Mystery hid since the world be∣ganne and from all ages▪ but now is made manifest to his Saints. This verse, for the connexion looketh vp to the former as an explication of that the Apostle sayd in the end of it, of what word he spake (namely) of that Which is the My∣stery hid since the world beganne (that is) the word of the Go∣spell, and for the matter and substance of this verse it con∣taines a third argument to perswade the Colossians to con∣tinue grounded in the faith. The argument is taken from the excellency of the Go∣spell, that the Gospell is a hidden and deepe Mystery and so of great excellency, therefore being preached and re∣uealed vnto them, they ought to make precious account of it, and to continue in the sound profession of it. The order and disposition of this verse in it selfe is on this manner. First, we haue an instance or particular insisting in that part of the word of God, that the Apostle was to publish, euen that which is the Mystery. Secondly, to this is subioyned a distinct and different condition of this Mystery in respect of distinct and diffe∣rent times that it is. Hid and Manifested. Hid in respect of former and foregoing times in these word. Hid since the world beganne. Manifested in regard of time present, but now is made manifest. Thirdly, to this is added the persons to whom it is ma∣nifested in the last words to his Saints. Come wee to the particular examination of the words and first of this Mistery hid in these words, which is the my∣stery
hid since the world beganne. Vnder the word Mystery, that we are to vnderstand the Gospell it is euident by the context, for the Apostle sayth in the verse before,Interpreta∣tion. it is the word of God, and in the verse following, that word, that hath Christ for the matter of it, and that is onely the Go∣spell. Now the Gospell which containes the doctrine of the humiliation, exaltation, humanity, diuinity, office of mediation and all things concerning the life and death of Christ is called a Mystery because it is wonderfull; deepe, secret and vnsearchable, for that is the proper and natu∣rall signification of the word () (Mystery) and wee shall finde in Scripture this word alwayes vsed to signifie a thing secret in religion, Ephes. 5.32. the Apostle speaking of the neere vnion and coniunction of Christ and his Church sayth, , this is a great secret, we haue there the same originall word, that heere is vsed (hid) or rather as the ori∣ginall word is, (hath beene hid) since the world beganne, the words are from worlds) the meaning is from all eternity, and from all ages, (that is) from all generations of the world, till the comming of Christ in the flesh, the Gospell was hid from the Gentiles simply, and from the Iewes comparatiuely, in comparison of the cleere lighr and ma∣nifestation of it since the incarnation of Christ, so doth the Apostle expound himselfe,Ephes. 3.5. Which in other ages was not opened as now it is reuealed vnto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit. Thus then the words are to be conceiued, euen that se∣cret and vnsearchable doctrine of the Gospell which hath beene hid and kept secret from all eternity, and from all generation of the world, simply from the Gentils, and in comparison from the Iewes before the incarnation of Christ. Heere first let it be obserued in a word against the false and deceitfull dealing of the Papists that the word  is translated by them a Mystery in this verse and in theA popish de∣ceit discoue∣red.
next verse Sacrament thereby labouring to maintaine the false opinion grounded on Ephes. 5.32. that Matri∣mony is a sacrament, and so they translate that place, and thence would they ground it, but (indeed) the opinion is erroneous and false and that text will not warrant it, for the opinion it selfe, it cannot bee that matrimony should be a Sacrament. Reasons pro∣uing Matri∣mony to be no sacrament. First, because it was ordained in Paradice before the fall, but the Sacraments of the new Testament were ordained after Christ his comming in the flesh. Againe, a Sacrament of the new Testament is an out∣ward seale of Gods grace vnto saluation, a seale of the righteousnesse of faith, so sayth the Apostle, which Ma∣trimony is not, neither can the Papists euer prooue it so to be, and therefore no Sacrament, and for the ground of their opinion, they meerely wrest, and peruert the text, for the Apostle doth inplaine terms auouch that he speaks concerning spirituall marriage betweene Christ and his Church, this is a great secret, but I speake of Christ, and his Church. Againe, to say that Matrimony is a Sacrament, because the word  Mystery is giuen to it, is most absurd and foolish,Rom. 4.11. for they might aswell say, that the Gospell it selfe is a Sacrament, which in this text is so called, but that were as grosse as to say, the seale and the writing are all one, for Sacraments are seales of the couenant of grace written in the Gospell, yea, they might aswell affirme that the close working and secret insinuation of Antichrist into the Church of God is a sacrament, which is called a My∣stery, but a Mystery of iniquity, 2. Thes. 2.7. yea also, that name written in the fore head of the whore, Reu. 17.5. How absurd and foolish then it is to say, that Matrimo∣ny is a sacrament, because it is called by the Apostle , a Mystery, any man of the meanest capacity may easily discerne. Let it be further obserued that the word of the Gospell
hath this tittle giuen to it, that it is a mystery, a deep secret and hidden doctrine, the consideration of this doth offer this conclusion. That it is no easie matter truely to vnderstand, know  and beleeue the Gospell,It is no easie matter truly to vnderstand know & be∣leeue the Go∣spell. a man cannot easily come to haue knowledge and faith in the secrets of the Gospell needfull to bee knowen, and beleeued to his owne saluation, for proofe of this, that one place is sufficient, 1. Tim. 3.16. without controuersie great is the Mystery of godlinesse, the doctrine of godlinesse, the Gospell, is not onely a my∣stery, but a great Mystery full of secrets and of exceeding profoundnesse and depth, and it is so without all question or controuersie, the word signifieth by all mens confession that it is an opinion or truth generally confessed of all, and that the Gospell is not easily coneeiued and beleeued, it were easie to giue instance of particulars, wee preach Christ crucified vnto the Iewes, euen a stumbling blocke,1. Cor. 1.23. and vnto the Grecians foolishnesse.Acts 17.18. The Athenians the wisest of all the Heathen, sayd Paul was a babler or trifler, and setter foorth of strange gods, when he preached Iesus, the very substance of the Gospell and the resurrection. Yea, come we to those that make profession of Christ and of his Gospell, some of them are naturall and carnall, and cannot perceiue the things of the spirit of God. 1. Cor. 2.14 others are regenerate and perceiue them, but it is onely in part, & that by the speciall gift of God,Mat. 13.11. and the reason of this is,  because there is no seed of the Gospell in nature the morall Law is written in nature by creation,Rom. 2.15. & since the fall we haue some remainder of it in vs:  the Gentiles shew the effect of the Law written in their hearts,We must take heed we deceiue not our selues touching our knowledge & faith in the promises of the Gospell. but the Go∣spell the ground of it being Iesus Christ, is aboue the reach of nture, created of nature in the state of innocency, and much more of nature corrupted, & therfore it is no easie matter truly to conceiue and beleeue the doctrine of the gospell, & this must teach vs to take heed we deceiue not our selues touching our knowledge & faith in the promises
of the Gospell, if we neuer felt the mighty and powerfull worke of God, or the working of his mighty power, as the Apostle speakes,Ephes. 1.19. to worke in vs vnderstanding and faith in the Gospell, but haue a faith easily conceiued without any supernaturall worke: We haue indeed no true faith: it is the faith of the greatest number in the world, euen a faith conceiued without any hardnesse or paines at all, a faith conceiued onely by tradition, because they are bred and borne and brought vp in the bosome of the Church, and haue heard it deliuered in the Church, that Iesus Christ came into the world, tooke our nature on him, and suffered death on the crosse, thereupon they conceiue in minde a bare perswasion that Christ is their Sauiour, and they can repeat and patter ouer all the Articles of the Creed, yea, some are so grossely ignorant as they repeat them as a prayer, which is ignorance as thicke as the dark∣nesse of Aegypt, it is palpable and may be felt. Thus ma∣ny doe, and presently they imagine they stedfastly beleeue them, without finding any hardnesse in the matter, or any vnbeleefe in thir hearts, in respect of any one article of the Creed, I appeale to mens consciences in this case, yea, the speech of many ignorant persons makes it knowen, being asked whether they beleeue the articles of faith, their an∣swer is ready, they neuer doubted of any one article in all their life, they beleeue them all. Now what is this though we seeme to renounce Pope∣ry, but indeed to fall into a dangerous errour of popish learning, to haue an implicite faith, a faith wrapped vp and enfolded in the generall, to beleeue as the Church be∣leeues, which is a faith easily and soone conceiued, to be∣leeue as the Church beleeues without further adoe. Wee must therefore remember what hath beene now deliuered, that it is no easie matter, truely to know and beleeue the doctrine of the Gospell,Note. the Gospell of Christ being the materiall obiect of faith, and the mercy of God in Christ for the remission of sinnes the formall obiect of it, are great
and vnspeakable mysteries, and cannot be comprehended without much hardnesse, and much striuing against natu∣rall vnbeleefe and know it for a truth, we neuer truely be∣leeue the Gospell to saluation, till wee can say with a true feeling of our owne weaknesse and want of faith, as he said in the Gospell, Lord I beleeue, Lord helpe mine vnbe∣leefe, till we finde and feele the power of Gods spirit in vs, ouermastering our naturall hardnesse and our vnbeleefe, touching the secrets of the Gospell, and know for a con∣clusion of this point, that faith easily gotten, is but a fickle and loose imagination, and in time of triall or temptation or great affliction, it will faile vs, it is a faith of nature and reason, and not of the spirit of God, and when nature and reason faile, that faith cannot stand. I will adde one other short vse of this doctrine, is it so  that it is no easie matter to vnderstand, and beleeue the Gospell, and euen the Angels stand amazed, and with ad∣miration desire to behold the wonders of the Gospell, a∣way then with all high conceit of wit. Come wee to the hearing of the Gospell preached with an humble heart,Wee must come to the hearing of the Gospell preached with humble hearts. 1. Pet. 1.12. Iam. 4.6. an heart emptied of all swelling conceipt, for such as haue it are vnfit to receiue the wisedome of God, they are ill di∣sposed to receiue it, yea, God doth resist them, God resisteth the proud &c. the word signifies that God doth set himselfe as it were in battell aray against them, to fight with them, and therfore will not reueale his secrets to his enemies, being to fight with them: pray wee then euer with Dauid, Psal. 119.18. Open mine eyes that I may see the wonders of thy Law. That I may see the wonders and great mysteries of thy Gospell, yea, let vs not rest in that we conceiue of our owne heads, out of the word of the Gospell, or that wee heare and learne of our Teachers, but let vs striue with God by prayer to be also inwardly taught by his Spirit; for here is one cause why some fall from that they haue heard and learned,Note. because they pinne their faith on the sleeue of their Teacher, and if hee fall they fall with him, because
their ground is gone. Let as many as desire to continue stedfast in the truth, neuer rest in that, they haue cōceiued either of themselues or by the teaching of men, but craue that the Lord by his spirit may instruct them, and then no doubt the Lord will not send them away empty, but will so season their hearts by his grace, that though thousands fall away on euery side, yet they shall continue stedfast in the truth taught and receiued, Now from these words (hid since the world beganne) that is, as we shewed from all eternity, is plainely euinced and prooued vnto vs, the eternity of the gospell. That the go∣spell is the eternall word of God hid in God,The Gospell is the eternall word of God. and as anci∣ent as God hhimselfe.Ephes. 39. The inference vpon this by way of vse might bee to prooue that the sending of Christ into the world was de∣creed that the permissio of the fall of man was decreed, & his redemption by Christ also was decreed in the eternall councell of God, but I passe by these things, these things are more fit to be examined and discussed in the schooles, yet let the eternity of the gospell be thought on as many as truely beleeue the promise of the gospell,  The eternity of the Gospel is a ground of sound cōfort to all true be∣leeuers. it may serue to strengthen and confirme them in neuer failing comfort for as many as by true faith rest vpon the promise of the gospell touching remission of sinnes and iustification by Christ may be sure that the ground on which they rest will neuer faile them, the gospell is eternall comming out of the bosome of God the Father, therefore as immutable and vnchangeable as God himselfe, and as impossible it is that he that doth rest vpon the promise of the gospell, tou∣ching life and saluation, should be deceiued as he that re∣steth vpon God himselfe, who cannot possible lie nor de∣ceiue, all the promises of God in Christ are, yea, and A∣men sayth the Apostle, 2. Corinth. 1.20. that is, they are certaine; and infallible, and Heb. 6, 18. the promise made to Abraham, and in him to all the faithfull is ioyned with the oath of God, and the holy ghost there sayth: these are
two immutable things wherein it is vnpossible that God should lie: that as many as haue refuge to hold fast the hope that is set before them might haue strong consolation, and let as many as truely beleeue thinke vpon it to their comfort. It followeth (and from all ages) the next point that is offered from these words (being vnderstood as they haue beene formerly expounded) is this, that the vocation  or calling of men to life euerlasting, is not vniuersall,The vocation and calling of men to life euerlasting is not vniuersall. it reacheth not to all times, places and persons of the world, the Gospell by which men are called (as it is cleere from this and other places of Scripture was not reuealed for many generations vnto the Gentiles; to en∣quire into the cause were curiosity and bold presumption, we are rather to adore the secret iudgements of God, and for the reuelation of the Gospell to vs, to magnifie the mer∣cy of God and to become thankfull, but for the point it is cleere by many testimonies of Scripture, that the Gospell was not reuealed to the Gentiles for many ages, it is said,Acts 14.16. God in times past (that is) before the comming of Christ in the flesh, suffered the Gentiles to walke in their owne wayes.Eph. 2.12. Rom. 15.20. The Gentiles in times past were without Christ yea, without God as Atheists in the world: Paul prea∣ched where Christ was not so much as named according to the prophesie of Isay. 52.14. to whom he was not spo∣ken of, he shall be seene, & that which they had not heard, shall they vnderstand. How then can that position & that conclusion,  held by some, be true that redemption wrought by Christ is vni∣uersall in respect of the whole world,That redemp∣tion wrought by Christ is vniuersall is an errour. that Christ dyed to redeem all generally without exception, & that some not∣withstanding are not saued is through their owne default, because they will not? this position besides the errour of it, in making the sinne of the world death, and hell stron∣ger then Christ, or at least Gods purpose variable, and sub∣iect to mans will, which are fowle errours, besides this, it
cannot stand with the truth of this text, for if redemption bee vniuersall, then must it of necessity bee vniuersally knowen, for otherwise it is no vniuersall benefit, it is a be∣nefit onely to such as know and beleeue it, and if it be not knowen, it cannot be beleeued. Now this text makes it cleere, that it was neuer vniuer∣sally knowen, but rather the contrary, it was hid from many ages, therefore vniuersall redemption is but a de∣uice of mans braine, and wee shall finde it to bee but a deceiuing ground of comfort if wee rest vppon this, that Christ dyed for all,Note. and haue no better ground of comfort in time of need, it will faile vs, for then will the distressed conscience bee ready to exempt it selfe from the benefit of redemption, and say, Christ indeed dyed for all, if all would receiue him, but I by my sinnes haue cut my selfe off from him, therefore the benefit of his death will doe me no good, let vs then renounce it as erroneous and false, that redemption by Christ is vniuersall. Let vs come to speake of the Gospell in respect of the time present (but now is made manifest to the Saints) by the word (now) wee are to vnderstand this last age of the world,Interpreta∣tion. beginning from the comming of Christ in the flesh, and reaching to his second comming to iudgement, all tne time of the new Testament, which is called by the Apostle, the acceptable time, the time of grace and day of saluation, 2. Corinth. 6.2. and that this word hath this signification and extent, the Apostle makes it most cleere, Rom. 16.26. the Mysterie kept secret since the world began but now is opened, and published among all nations;) for the word of faith beganne to bee preached to the Gentiles, onely after the comming of Christ in the flesh, and not before (to his Saints) that is as the Apostle expounds himselfe, Ephes. 3.5. first and principally to his holy A∣postles and Prophets of the new Testament, who were sanctified, and set a part to preach the Gospell, and se∣condarily to all the faithfull sanctified by the spirit of
Christ, thus then are the woordes to bee conc e¦ued. But now in this last age of the world, in the time of the new Testament is the Gospell reuealed to his holy Apo∣stles, and Prophets of the new Testament, and to all the faithfull sanctified by the Spirit of Christ. Wee are heere to marke the opposite condition of the Gospell in respect of different times, that in former times it was hid from the world, but now is reuealed, to∣gether with the amplification, to whom (namely) to the Saints, taking all together, wee are put in minde of this conclusion. That ignorance of the Gospell now vnder the gospell,  and in the time of the new Testament,Ignorance of the Gospel in them that be of yeeres and discretion is now in these daies a feare∣full thing. in such as bee of yeeres and discretion (for of infants knowledge it not required, they being children of beleeuing parents, haue, title to Christ by the tenour of the couenant of grace I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed) but in such as be of yeeres, it is a most fearefull thing, though it bee no easie matter truely to vnderstand and beleeue the gospell, in respect of naturall hardnesse and vnbeleefe, yet to the Saints, to them that are sanctified, it is now made mani∣fest, therefore now for them that ought to know; to bee ignorant of the Gospell, is a most fearefull thing it seales vp want of grace and sanctification. If the gospell be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; The Apostle saith in the verse before,2. Cor. 4.3. that hee did approoue himselfe to euery mans conscience in the sight of God, in the manifest de∣claration of the truth of the Gospell, and heereupon hee doth inferre, if our gospell bee then hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In whom the God of this world the Diuell, hath blinded the mindes (that is) of the Infidels, that the light of the glorious gospell of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them. Hence it is most cleere, that ignorance of the gospell in such as ought to know it, is a fearefull signe, it shewes not onely want of
grace and sanctification but that God euen now sits in iudgement vpon such persons, and hath begun to make knowen their reprobation and finall perdition,  and let this bee thought on by all such as are ignorant of the doctrine of the Gospell,Reproofe of them that are now ignorant of the doctrin of the Gospel. and yet ought to know it, and haue meanes to knowe it, many there bee that are so farre from the true knowledge of the Gospell, as they cannot distinguish the truth of the Gospell from errour and falshood, yea, some plead for themselues that they are not booke-learned, and therefore (as they imagine) ought to be excused in their grosse ignorance, such persons conclude their owne iudgement, and giue sentence against themselues, that they want grace, and are in a fearefull condition, howsoeuer ignorance might before the mani∣festation of the Gospell, excuse from so great sinne, yet could it not excuse from sinne altogether, but now to plead ignorance in the cleere light of the Gospell is voyd of all excuse, yea, it argues that Gods wrath and vengeance hath taken hold on such persons; many will bee ready to exempt themselues from this fearefull condition, and I doubt not, but some may truely say it, that they know the way of saluation, the doctrine of re∣demption published in the Gospell, and let such persons further consider the argument of the Apostle, Rom. 13.11. that the more knowledge wee haue, and the neerer wee come to saluation, the more wee ought to answer it is holinesse, considering the season sayth the Apostle it is now time that wee should arise from sleepe, for now is our saluation neerer, then when we beleeued; the night is past, and the day is at hand, let vs therefore cast away the workes of darkenesse, and let vs put on the armor of light, so that wee walke honestly, as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkennesse, neitheir in chambering and wantonnesse, nor in strife and enuying. If men that know the doctrin of the Gospell walke in gluttony, drunkennes, chambering, wantonnesse, strife, contention & malice &c.
it argues that the vaines of spirituall life are frozen vppe in them, yea, these latter sinnes are more vgly then the sinnes of their former ignorance, the Apostle calles the Galathians fooles, Gal. 3.1. and why? because they knew not the doctrine of the Gospell? No, but because they did not obey the trueth of the Gospell, Christ beeing in liuely and euident manner preached vnto them, as if hee had beene crucified among them, where the Apostle doth giue vs to vnderstand, that if the doctrine of salua∣tion by Christ bee plainely deliuered, and vppon the de∣liuery of it, vnderstood and knowen, and yet not obey∣ed, not answered, in faith and repentance, according to knowledge, such persons as so vnderstand and know it, are foolish and bewitched by some enchantment, they are deluded by some secret operation and working of the Diuell. VER. 27. To whom God would make knowen, what is the riches of this glorious mystery among the Gentiles, which riches is Christ in you, the hope of glory. In this verse the Apostle doth further set out the mani∣festation of the Gospell to the Saints, by the efficient cause of it, (namely) the will of God in the first words, to whom God would make known, then he doth further commend the mystery of the Gospell. First by the condition of it, that it is richly glorious, what is the riches of this glorious mystery. Secondly, by the extent (among the Gentiles) And be∣cause they might doubt what is meant by riches of the Go∣spell, and might vnderstand his words, as spoken of the riches of glory laid vp in heauen, the Apostle doth explain himselfe in the words following, which riches is Christ in you the hope of glory. In which words is couched a fourth argu∣ment to perswade the Colossians to continue in their faith.
Come wee to the words of this verse, as they are layd downe by the Apostle; And first of the efficient cause of the manifestation of the Gospell to the Saints (To whom God would make knowen) the will of God is one and the same without diuision and distinction; but for our vnder∣standing, it is by Diuines distinguished into the will of his good pleasure,Interpreta∣tion. and his will reuealed in his word, the rule of faith and obedience, wee are heere to vnderstand the will of his good pleasure according to that of our Sauiour, Mat. 11.26. at that time Iesus answered &c. it is so O Father, because thy good pleasure was such, when there∣fore the Apostle saith, to whom God would make known, his meaning is to whom God according to the good plea∣sure of his will would make knowen. We are heere to marke that the Apostle is not content to say that the Mystery of the Gospell now in the time of the new Testament is opened and made manifest to the faithfull sanctified by the Spirit of Christ, but he goes fur∣ther and sets downe the good pleasure of God, the origi∣nall and the cause of their vnderstanding and knowledge of the Gospell. Hence ariseth this poynt of instruction. That the cleere light of the Gospell doth enlighten none but such as it pleaseth God to illuminate.The cleere light of the Gospell doth enlighten none but such as it pleaseth God to illu∣minate. Notwith∣standing the manifest Reuelation of the Gospell now in the time of the new Testament, yet none come truely to vnderstand and know it, but onely such as according to the good pleasure of God, are by him enlightned▪ onely they to whom it pleaseth God to make it knowen, and for this cause Paul prayed for the Ephesians, that the Spirit of wisedome and reuelation might bee giuen them, that the eyes of their vnderstanding might bee lightned, that they might knowe what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in the Saints Ephes. 1.17.18. and hence it is, that the Apostle sayth, 2. Cor. 4.6. that God by the same almighty power
whereby he brought light out of darknesse at the first cre∣ation of all things, doth shine in our hearts to giue the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ. Vnlesse it please God to open our eyes, to see the secrets of the Gospell, we are like the two disciples, Luk. 24. that went with Christ to Emaus, walked and talked with him and yet knew him not; so we passe along with Christ in the Gospell, and heare him speake vnto vs, & yet haue our eyes held that we cannot know him, daily expe∣rience teacheth the truth of this poynt, and their is rea∣son  for it, because indeed it is the prerogatiue God doth reserue peculiar to himselfe, to make men vnderstand and know the doctrine of the word and Gospell, therfore the Apostle saith, Paul may plant and Apollos may water,1. Cor. 3.7. but God onely giueth the encrease, where, when, and to whom it pleaseth him. Some may say;  Wee read that the word it selfe conuerteth,Psal. 19.7.8. Psal. 119.130. giues wisedome and vnderstanding & light to the eyes; and therefore it is not peculiar to God, to illuminate. The word doth conuert, enlighten,  giue wisedome and vnderstanding, onely as an instrument, and that not as a naturall instrument, as hauing vertue in it selfe as a medicine is a meanes of health; but as an instrument signifying and testifying that which the spirit of God doth inwardly worke, and only where it pleaseth God to worke there the word doth enlighten: it remains then a truth that the cleere light of the gospell doth inlighten none but such as it pleaseth God to illuminate, the consideration of this  may in some sort arme & strengthen vs against offence, & may teach vs not to bee offended, nor to stumble at it be∣cause now in the cleere light of the gospell, all are not refor∣med as they ought to be,Against of∣fence taken at this that all are nor now reformed by the cleere light of the Gospell. & because where the word is truly preached, there some continue in their hardnes & sin, and are notorious sinners vnreformed, we must remember that the knowledg of the truth & reformation is that which on∣ly God must giue, and it is giuen at his good pleasure and though the preachers of the gospell, should with Paul wish
themselues separated from Christ for the winning of men, yet shall no more bee wonne to Christ then it pleaseth his Father to draw,Iohn. 6.44. consider we the preaching of Christ him∣selfe: neuer man did or shall preach with like holinesse and power, were al reformed that heard him? nay were his own disciples throughly reformed as they ought? no surely, our Sauiour doth often iustly reproue their want of faith, and let this then strengthen vs against offence because all men are not reformed by the preaching of the Gospell. Let vs know that thus to bee offended is as much as to bee angry with the Lord, for doing with his owne as pleaseth him, & to quarrell with the spirit of God for blowing where hee li∣steth which is fearefull if it be not duly cosidered. For a second vse,Such as are inlightned by the Gospell are to be thāk¦ful to God for that mercy. Mat. 11.25. is it so that the cleare light of the Gos∣pell doth enlighten none but such as it pleaseth God to il∣luminate, then let as many as it pleaseth God to enlighten with the knowledge of his trueth, magnifie the mercy of God, and bee thankfull vnto him for that his great good∣nes, we haue the example of Christ himselfe in this kind. If we that haue the knowledge of the truth consider, how ma∣ny are left in ignorance, how many are giuen ouer to po∣pish superstition, yea how many liuing in the same place with vs, frequenting the same meanes of saluation that we doe, and yet remaine in their naturall blindnesse, wee shall find that we haue great cause to magnifie the great good∣nes of God towards vs, not onely in giuing vnto vs his gos∣pell, but making vs to vnderstand that aboue many thou∣sands, it is a blessing to haue the Gospell brought vnto vs, but a double blessing is it to haue vnderstanding harts gi∣uen vs, harts moued & yeelding to the truth of the gospel, euery one that hath this blessing vouchsafed may iustly breake out & say, Lord what am I that thou shouldst shew mee such mercy, I was borne and brought forth in sinne as other men, I haue multiplied & enlarged my sinnes, both before knowledge & since, my vnthankfulnes is great, my vnwor∣thines greater, yet thou hast vouchsafed mee mercy aboue
many thousands, and thus are we to meditate on the mer∣cy of God in giuing vs knowledge of the Gospell, and to open our mouths in praise and thanksgiuing for the same. Come we to the commendation of the mystery of the Gospell in the next words (what is the riches of this glorious mystery) the wordes are, what is the riches of the glory of this mystery, the word (riches) is metaphoricall borrowed from outward good things,Interpreta∣tion. and doth heere signifie plenty and aboundance of glory: wee finde the word vsed in this sence in many places of the Scripture Rom. 11.33. the A∣postle speaking of the admirable depth of Gods iudge∣ments, breakes out on this manner, O the deepenes of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God, and thus he calls the vnspeakeable bountifulnesse of God, the riches of his bountifulnes, (of the glory) (that is) of the ex∣cellency of this mystery, both in it selfe, & in regard of the effect making excellent, thus then are these words to bee conceiued, what is the exceeding great & abundant excel∣lency of this mystery in it selfe, and in the effect of it. Heer first it is to be obserued that the Apostle saith God would make knowne to his Saints, not barely the mystery of the Gospell, but the riches of that mystery, and hence a∣riseth this conclusion. That as many as are truely enlightned by the Spirit  of God in the knowledge of the Gospell,They that tru∣ly know the Gospel know more then the truth and sto∣ry of it. they know more then the truth and the story of the Gospell. God doth make knowne to his Saints the riches and the glory of the Gospell, the good, the excellent, the sweet and com∣fortable things of the gospell, they know the Gospell as rich men may be said truly to know their riches when they know them in the vse and comfort of them, so they that are truly enlightned know the gospell in the right vse of it, in the sweet & excellent comfort of it, touching remission of their sins, peace of conscience, adoption through Christ, ioy in the holy ghost, Ephes. 1.18. the Apostle prayes for the Ephesians that they might know what the bare story
of the Gospell? no, but what the hope of glory, and what the riches of his glorious mystery among the Gentiles is. The reason of this truth is giuen by the Apostle. 1. Cor. 2.9.10.11 12. and it stands thus, God giues to his Saints his Spirit, the Spirit reueales vnto them the Secrets of the Lord, not onely generall things knowne by the common gift of illumination, but the deepe things of God the hid∣den treasures of the Lord,1. Cor. 2.9. the things eye hath not seene, neither eare hath heard, neither came into the heart of man, which God hath prepared for them that loue him, therefore they sticke not in the letter of the Gospell, but find the marrow and sweetnesse of it. And for the vse of this point, it may serue as a ground of triall; heereby wee may trie whether we be truly enlightened, and haue true and sauing knowledge of the Gospell or no. If we rest not in the letter; in the bare knowledge of the truth and story but search further and find the sweetnesse and comfort of the Gospell then wee haue true know∣ledge of it.Triall whe∣ther we haue true and sa∣uing know∣ledge of the Gospel or no. Now because euery one will bee ready to assume this to himselfe that he finds the sweetnes of the Gospell, some rule of direction is needfull that in this case wee deceiue not our selues, we are therefore to know that then we find the sweetnesse of the Gospell, when wee finde that delight and comfort in it, that worldly minded men doe in their riches, and treasures, when we are affected to it, as to our chiefe treasure, when we find our desire after it insatiable, and especially when wee find the comfort of it in time of trouble and distresse,Note. for the most wicked will seeme to find comfort in the Gospell in time of health and prospe∣rity, but if we can truly say with Dauid Psalm. 119.50. it is my comfort in my trouble, then we haue found the sweet∣nesse of it, then wee haue true knowledge of the Gospell, and to stirre vs vp to labour for this, consider but thus much, that not onely the Law, but the Gospell also is a killing letter, if we rest in the letter of it, and neuer search
into the Spirit, the life, the sweetnesse, and the comfort of it, yea (as I shewed not long since) nothing doth more gal the heart wounded for sinne, then the remembrance of the sweet promise of the gospeil: if it find it not belonging to it selfe. Let vs then truly pray that wee may truly finde out the sweetnes of the gospel, that it may stand by vs and comfort vs in our greatest distresse. The next thing we haue to marke from these words is, that the excellency of the Gospell is layd before vs vnder the termes of riches and glory, two things much affected, and much sought after in the worlde, yea these two were the strength of the Diuels last & strongest temptation, laid against our Sauiour, Math. 4.9. hee knowing the power of these two to allure to sinne, hee shewed him all the king∣domes of the world, and said, all these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me. Hence we may take vp this conclusion, that looke what  things the world hath in it to satisfie the desires of worldly minded men,The Gospell hath more ex∣cellent things in it to con∣tent the minds of true belee∣uers then the world hath in it to satisfie the desires of worldly min∣ded men. and to giue them comfort and contentment the same or rather more excellent things hath the Gospell, in as much as heauenly things are aboue earthly comforts and contentments, euen most excellent to the soules of true beleeuers, hath the Gospell in it selfe. For why? the riches of the Gospell is Christ in whom is found all sweet comfort and contentment, euen all the treasures of grace and glory, hence it is that Salomon brings in wisedom (that is) the wisedome of the Father Christ Iesus, Pro. 8.18. say∣ing riches and honour are with mee,  euen durable riches and righteousnesse. Seeing then the Gospell is so rich a treasure in it selfe, we are to esteeme of it euen for it selfe, and not to think basely of the Gospell, because it is offered and brought vnto vs in earthen vessels,Wee are to e∣steeme of the Gospell for it selfe, and not to think base∣ly o it be∣cause it is brought vnto vs in earthen vessels. weake, frayle, miserable and mortall men as the Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 4. we must know that the ex∣cellency of the Gospell dependeth not vpon any thing out
of it selfe, as not vpon the worthinesse of him that brings it, though it be an Angell from Heauen, as it was Luke. 2. who brought tydings of it to the shepheards, neither doth the vnworthinesse of him that is the bringer, any thing di∣minish or detract from the excellency of the Gospell it selfe, which is a thing that some in these dayes doe stumble at, and thinke that if the messenger bee stained with any spot or crime, then they ought not to receiue the word of the Gospell at his hand, it were to be wished indeed that all the Ministers of the Gospell, as they are called Angels, had Angelicall purity, but let vs take heed, wee fasten not that vnworthinesse that is found vpon the heauenly and excel∣lent mystery of the Gospell, that we esteeme not that more or lesse excellent, according to the condition of him that brings it, in common reason we know it is absurd to make the truth or goodnes of the message depend vpon the qua∣lity of the messenger, we will with gladnes receiue good newes, or that we are sure concernes our good whosoeuer brings it, and shall wee then refuse the glad tydings and comfort of the Gospell for the fault of those that bring it, we are to try the spirits and doctrines of men, and finding them to be of God, and indeed the word of the gospell, we are to embrace them as full of heauenly comfort in them∣selues, and heerein follow the example of the Apostle, Phil. 1.18. he saith verse 15. some preach Christ through enuy and strife not purely (that is in regard of their corrupt minds, for otherwise their doctrin was pure, what then? yet Christ is preached &c. & thus are we to ioy in the gospell excellent & cōfortable in it self, euen for it self, by whom∣soeuer its brought vnto vs, yea, we are to loue the Gospell excellent in it selfe, euen for it selfe, not in respect of any thing out of it selfe attending vppon it, because it brings with it wealth, peace and prosperity, for so to loue it, is to verifie the Diuels argument against Iob, that as hee sayd, Iob feared God because of his plenty of outward things, so we loue the gospell, yea, this is indeed to loue our selues
or to loue the Gospell not for it selfe, but for our selues be∣cause it brings aduantage, because it brings things plea∣sing or profitable vnto vs. Some may say how shall we know we loue the gospell for it selfe in the midst of plenty and aboundance of out∣ward things. We loue the gospell in the middest of plenty and abun∣dance of outward things,  when notwithstanding our plen∣ty, our thoughts euer run vpon the comforts of the Gos∣pell, as Dauid saith, Oh how loue I thy law, it is my meditation continually, if it be so with vs, though we cannot alwaies be hearing, reading, or talking of the Gospell, yet if we conti∣nually meditate and think vpon it, then we loue it indeed. Another thing to bee gathered from these words, vn∣derstood as they haue bin expounded is this. That the gospell is not onely of great excellency in it  selfe, but doth make all true pofessours of it most excellent and glorious,The Gospell makes all true professours of it most excel∣lent and glo∣rious. Prou. the 4.8: saith the wise man, exalt wis∣dome, and she shall exalt thee, she shal bring thee to honor: if thou embrace her, shee shall giue thee a comely orna∣ment vnto thine head, yea, shee shall giue thee a crowne of glory.Pro. 4.8.9. Our Sauiour the wisedome of his Father, and the sub∣stance of the Gospell saith, Pro. 8.19. his fruit is better then gold, he makes more excellent and glorious then all the riches in the world, for (indeed) he makes all that truly be∣leeue in him, Kings and Priests to the Lord, yea fellow heires with him of heauen, & giues them right and title to that crowne of glory, the righteous Lord hath laid vp for all that loue his appearance, it is therefore a cleare trueth  that the Gospell makes all true professors of it most excel∣lent and glorious, and therefore it is a meere calumny and slander to say as some doe, that the true profession of the Gospell is the way to beggery and shame.It is a meere calumny that the true pro∣fession of the Gospel brings beggery and shame. The Gospel is richly glorious, not only in it selfe, but in the effect of it, if thou bee a true professour of it, it will
enrich thee with such glory as all the worlde is not able to afford, it will make thee, not onely gracious and glorious in the sight of God, good Angels, and good men, but thou shalt be honoured in the inward conceits of the very wic∣ked, as we read Exod. 11.3. that Moses was very great in the land of Aegypt in the sight of Pharaohs seruants, and there is reason for this why? Glory is euer an vndeuided companion of goodnes, as shame is of sinne, and what greater goodnes then truly to embrace the Gospel, it is worthy obseruation that we find, yeelded as the reason why such as are rayled vpon for the name of Christ, are blessed, 1. Pet. 4.14. because the spirit of glory and of God resteth vpon them. Who then shall be able to take glory from them? not all the power of hell; though poore Naboth, 1. King. 21, might seeme to haue all credit and good name quite taken away for euer, being ac∣cused, conuicted and executed for no lesse then high trea∣son and blasphemy, yet the Lord who knew his innocen∣cy hath cleared him, and in stead of a momentany shame suffred by him, hath giuen him an honorable name, stan∣ding vpon perpetuall record to all succeeding ages. Let vs then remember it, that the way to become truely excellent and glorious,The Lord will disappoint them that thinke to get glory by any other thing saue onely the true professiō of the Gospel. not onely in respect of the eternall waight of glory in heauen, but euen in this world is truly to embrace the Gospell, and if any thinke to make him∣selfe excellent and glorious by any other thing, let him know the Lord will disappoint him of his purpose, yea though it be by doing that which is exceeding good in it selfe (to passe by such as thinke to aduance themselues by sinfull courses, for they shall leaue their names as a curse vnto Gods chosen. Isay 65, 15.) For example, by yeelding reuerence and due respect, to them that bring glad tidings of the Gospell, if a man hould the feet of them that bring those glad tidings beautifull, anst doe reuerence them to get himselfe a name, and do not also embrace the Gospell brought by them, let such a man be sure the Lord wil fru∣strate
and make void his intention, looke vpon the exam∣ple of Herod, Marke 6.20. he knowing Iohn Baptist, saith the text, to be a iust man, and an holy, he reuerenced him, and heard him, yea hee did many things, and heard him gladly; thereby (no doubt▪) thinking to insinuate with Iohn, and to magnifie himselfe, and to get himself a name, but we know the Lord did disappoint him, we repute him not a man of famous memory, but behold in him the very image and picture of infamy, there cleaues a blotte to his name for euer, so surely as many as doe reuerence them who bring the glad tidings of the Gospell, and so doe a thing commendable in it selfe, but doe it onely to get themselues a name, and do not withall truely embrace the Gospell it selfe, they shall be disappointed of their purpose, yea the Lord doth inwardly imprint in the hearts of such their owne damnation, in that they can witnes with them∣selues, they obey not them in the doctrine of the Gospell, whom they doe approue for the grace of God, that is in them, let this be thought on, and let as many as desire to be truly excellent and glorious in the sight of God and of men and Angells, bee stirred vp in trueth and sincerity of hart to imbrace the Gospell, for so doing they shall be had in an euerlasting remembrance as saith the Psalmist Psal. 112.6. yea God will then vndertake the protection of their names, and will preserue them as their owne saluation; it followeth (among the Gentiles) (that is) among all nations of the world besides the Iewes, this doth shew that God  doth not reueale his Gospell, according to foreseene me∣rits,God doth not reueale his Gospell ac∣cording to foreseene me∣rits. he in the time appointed by himselfe made knowne the riches of the glorious mistery of the Gospell, to the Gentiles lying in darknes and grosse ignorance yea with∣out God in the world as the Apostle saith, Ephes. 2.12. yea we shall find that the Iewes before the comming of Christ were not preferd aboue the Gentiles in knowledge of the will of God for their merit, if we read Stephens testimonie of them Act. 7.51. to 54. and ioyne to this that of Ezechiel
16. from 3. to 7. wee shall easily yeeld to this trueth, that the Lord doth not call to saluation and reueale his truth, for any merit foreseene,  it is the error of the Papists, who hold the election of God,Confutation of the Papists. and consequently, the reuela∣tion of his truth, to bee for merit foreseene, wee are to renounce this as a grosse error, and for the Gospel brought & reuealed vnto vs, we being part of the Gentiles, to mag∣nifie the mercy of the Lord. Now to the last words of this verse, which are an exposi∣tion of the Apostles meaning, what wee are to vnderstand by the riches of the Gospell, and containe also a fourth ar∣gument to perswade the Colossians to continue in the faith, the argument is from the matter and substance of the Gospell, that the matter and substance of the Gospell, & the subiect of all true preaching of the Gospell is Christ our Sauiour and redeemer, by whom we looke for life and glory, and therefore they ought to continue stedfast in the profession of the trueth of the Gospell; that is the pur∣pose and drift of the Apostle in these words, and of the be∣ginning of the next verse, whom wee preach the wordes are (which is Christ in you the hope of glory) the worde (which) doth plainely shew in the originall to what it hath relati∣on (namely) to riches, and so the worde (Riches) may very well bee supplied (Christ in you) for the better conceauing of these wordes,Interpreta∣tion. wee must vnderstand that Christ his beeing in vs, is not locall or corporall, but spirituall and supernaturall. Christ is in vs after a spi∣rituall manner, (namely) by his spirite in respect of Christ himselfe, and by faith in respect of vs, for these are the spirituall bounds by which Christ is knit to vs, and we to him, and wee finde Christ his beeing in vs expressed in Scripture on this manner, that he dwelleth in vs by his spi∣rit, 1. Iohn 2 27. and againe by Faith, Ephes. 3.17. and that we mistake not Christ his being in vs, we must know further, that the Spirit of Christ is in vs, not in essence and substance; but in operation, he working in vs both to our
iustification and sanctification, hee both applying Christ vnto vs, and quickning vs by his grace to newnesse of life, (hope of glory) that is, by whom wee certainely hope and looke for glory in heauen. Hence is Christ called our hope, 1. Tim. 1.1. Thus then the words are to be conceaued. Which riches is Christ being in you by the apprehensi∣on of Faith, and by the operation of the Spirit of Christ by whom we certainely looke for glory in heauen. From the argument heere vsed by the Apostle take no∣tice of a grosse error of popish doctrine.A grosse error of the Papists confuted. The Papists teach that the Gospell is nothing else in effect, but the law of Moses made perfect, the law written in mens hearts by the holy Ghost, if this were true, then should the Law and the Gospell be all one in substance, & differing only in degree of perfection, then should Christ haue bin reuealed in the Law which is false, the Law neuer knew Christ nor faith in Christ, the mediator, God & man; the Apostle heer makes Christ the substance of the Gospell, and therein placeth the riches and excellency of the Gospell, which indeede were no preferment at all, if the Law and the Gospel were all one, it is sufficient to haue named this. The next thing we haue to marke is, that the Apostle saith, the riches of the Gospell is not onely Christ, but Christ in vs. The Gospell doth propound and set before vs Christ, not onely in his owne person, nature and office, but also in vs by the appre∣hension of faith, and application of his Spirit. Hence wee may gather, that to whomsoeuer Christ is a Sauiour, he is not a Sauiour altogether out of himselfe, hee is so a Sauiour to euery one, as hee is propounded and set forth in the Gospell, Now in the Gospell is set before vs, not onely a Sauiour out of vs, but also in vs, and therefore to whomsoeuer Christ is a Sauiour, hee is not a Sauiour altogether out of himselfe,To whomso∣euer Christ is a Sauiour hee is not a Saui∣our altogether out of himself. let no man misconster my speech, and mistake this conclusion it may be vnderstood as fauouring
and giuing allowance and strength to a Popish opinion, (namely) this, that Christ is a Sauiour in vs, by com∣municating and giuing merit to our workes, and making them meritorious as the Papists teach, this indeed is to make Christ not an absolute and perfect Sauiour by him∣selfe as wee are taught Hebrewes 7.25. but onely an in∣strument by whom wee must saue our selues, and there is no trueth in this, because Christ is not one with vs, by personall vnion which is the ground of all merit, euen in Christ himselfe, when therefore I say to whomsoeuer Christ is a Sauiour, hee is not a Sauiour altogether, out of himselfe, my meaning is according to the trueth of the word of God, that hee is a Sauiour vnto him, not onely by the merite of his death and obedience,How Christ is a Sauior in some sort in vs procuring pardon of sinne, and right to life eternall, but also by his efficacy by his effectuall working in him by his Spirite, working faith in his heart to apprehend his merite, and purging his heart from corruption, and turning it from sinne to God, and for proofe of this wee haue some pregnant places of Scripture Titus 2.14 saith the Apo∣stle, Christ gaue himselfe for vs, that hee might re∣deeme vs from all iniquity, and purge vs to be a pecu∣liar people vnto himselfe, zealous of good workes, not onely to bee a redeemer from the guilt and punishment of sin, but also from the corruption of sin, 1. Pet. 1.18. saith the Apostle, we were not redeemed with corruptible things as siluer and gold, but with the pretious bloud of Christ, as with a lambe vndefiled, and without spot, from what? from our vaine conuersation, saith the Apostle, whence it is cleere, that Christ is a redeemer of men, not onely from deserued condemnation, and so a redeemer out of them∣selues, but euen in them by the operatiō of his spirit redee∣ming, that is, freeing & deliuering them from the corrupti∣on of sin, and from wicked conuersation the fruit of it. And therefore to whomsoeuer Christ is a Sauiour, to him he is a Sauiour, not altogether out of himselfe.
The reason & ground of this is euident,  because Christ is a Sauiour, not onely by performing the outward worke of redemption, but by application of that worke, to the iu∣stication, and sanctification of as many as are redeemed. Now the application of the worke of redemption is, by the inward worke of his spirit, and therefore to whomsoe∣uer Christ is a Sauiour, to him in this sence is hee a Sauiour, not altogether out of himselfe. A point happily not knowne to a great number in the world; most men imagine Christ to be their Sauiour,  but altogether out of themselues,Reproofe of them who thinke that Christ is their Sauiour alto∣gether out of themselues. and heerein doth the Deuill take aduantage vpon our doctrine, the doctrine taught in our Church, that in the matter of iustification in Gods sight, and in the matter of saluation, wee must goe out of our selues, and seeke for iustification and saluation only in Christ: heereupon doth the Deuill take the hint, and de∣lude many thousands, perswading them it is sufficient if they beleeue or rather fancy to themselues, that they are iustified and also saued by the merit of Christ, by Christ a Sauiour altogether out of themselues, though they neuer find Christ a Sauiour in them by way of application of his merit to their iustification and sanctification. It is true (indeed) we must go out of our selues in the case of iustification and saluation in respect of merit, and seeke for that only in Christ, & rest only on him for that, but we must also find Christ in vs by the work of his Spirit apply∣ing his merit to our iustification, and cleansing vs to our sanctification (that is) we must find Christ a Sauiour vnto vs, out of vs by his merit, and in vs by the efficacy of his Spirit, and to stirre vs vp to labour for this, know it for a truth,Note. that we can neuer haue assurance that Christ hath saued vs by his merits till wee find he hath in some mea∣sure also wrought in vs, and purged vs by his spirit. Hee that is saued by Christ from hell, is by him also turned from sin to God, and if this be wanting, there can bee no assurance of the former. It is the Apostles own conclusion.
If vpon examination we find not Christ in vs, it seales vp a fearefull conclusion (namely) this, that wee are yet in the state of damnation, let as many as tender their owne salua∣tion, thinke vpon it, and neuer rest till they finde Christ a Sauiour out of them by his merits, and in them by the powerfull operation of his Spirit. Let vs further obserue as a ground of another instruction, that the Apostle saith, Christ in vs is the hope of glory, hence ariseth this conclu∣sion. That as many as haue a true hope of eternal life, they  haue it vpon this ground, that Christ is in them apprehen∣ded by faith dwelling in them by his spirit, no man can truly hope for life and saluation vnlesse Christ be in him.None can truly hope for life and salua∣tion vnlesse Christ bee in them. The reason  is plaine, because true hope is the daughter of true faith, faith doth first apprehend Christ, & then fol∣lowes hope, which is a certaine expectation of the accom∣plishment of the promise in Christ, and of full fruition of righteousnesse which shall bee reuealed when Christ our righteousnes shall appeare, as saith S. Iohn 1. Epist. 2.2. ther∣fore no man can truly hope for life & saluation, but on this ground that Christ is in him. Let this serue to discouer to wicked persons who liue in their ignorance and sinne,The discoue∣ry of the folly and vain hope of ignorant & wicked per∣sons. their folly, they commonly pro∣mise to themselues happinesse, life and saluation, & they hope to bee saued as well as the best, though they liue in in their sinnes, and follow after their sensuall pleasures e∣uen wiih greedinesse, but let them know: this is a meere il∣luding and deceiuing of themselues: this is to builde the hope of saluation vpon a rotten ground, vpon sinne ruling in them, not vpon Christ in them, the ground of true hope. Oh but then certainly look to haue hope in their death they trust at the last gaspe to call to God for mercy and to get the pardon of their sinnes, and to finde Christ in them to the sauing of their soules. Thus (indeed) wicked men flatter themselues, & thus they still discouer more and more their folly, for what (I
beseech you) is this but to thinke that death and the pangs of it are appointed for the begetting of true hope in them which is all one as if theeues and other malefa∣ctours should thinke the day of assises were appointed for their preferment, and to aduance them to some digni∣ty, let them consider what the wise man hath said, when a wicked man dieth, his hope perisheth,Pro. 11.17. and the hope of the vniust shall perish, euen that which hee hopes for doth va∣nish and deceaue him, and let them remember that threat∣ning sentence of the Lord, Deut. 29.20. it is able to shake their hearts, that if any man who walketh on in a course of sinne, blesse himselfe and promise himselfe peace and hap∣pinesse, hope and comfort, the Lord hath said in expresse words, he will not be mercifull to that man, how then can hee hope to die blessedly who liues wickedly: now the Lord cannot faile of his iustice and trueth to execute that he hath threatned. Let this therefore stirre vs vp to labour to put our soules out of danger before death, sicknesse, and trouble come vpon vs, let euery one of vs endeauour by all good means, that we may truly say with the Apostle, Gal. 2.20. Thus I liue, yet not I now, but Christ liueth in mee: and in that I now liue in the flesh, I liue by faith in the sonne of God, who hath loued me, and giuen himselfe for mee, and that will make our life prosperous, our death full of hope and comfort, and our state in the world to come immortall and glorious. VER. 28. Whom we preach, admonishing euery man, and teaching euery man in all wisedome▪ that we may pre∣sent euery man perfect in Christ Iesus. The Apostle in this verse doth first affirme that the sub∣iect of his and of the other Apostles preaching was Christ (whome wee preach) then hee doth further branch and
and deuide his preaching into two heads, videlicet: Admonition and Instruction. Admonishing and teaching, and hee doth amplifie both these by the common obiect of them, (euery man) and a∣gaine his instructing of euery man by the matter of it (namely) (wisedome) and that true and perfect wisedome, (in all wisedom) then he subioynes the end of his preaching, and admonishing in the last words, that we may present eue∣ry man perfect in Christ Iesus: these are the generall things propounded in this verse. Whom we preach] that is, which Christ we preach; wher∣as as the Apostle saith, the subiect of his preaching was Christ I will onely note this one thing briefly. That the matter of true preaching is Christ Iesus,The matter of true prea∣ching, is Christ Iesus. and one speciall note by which we may know doctrine deliue∣red to bee sound and good, is this, that it sets out vnto vs Christ Iesus with all due respect of his glory in the worke of redemption, and with due regard of the honour of his name, as the only King, Priest and Prophet of his Church. Hence it is that the Apostle, Galat. 3.1. calls the truth of the Gospell preached among the Galathians, a liuely descrip∣tion of Christ, as if hee had beene crucified among them, and S. Iohn, 1. Ioh. 4.1. teaching vs not to beleeue euery spirit, but to trye the spirits and doctrines of men whether they be of God or no. Among other notes set downe by him, whereby wee may bee able to discerne the spirit of truth, and the spirit of errour, this is the first note of diffe∣rence, that the doctrine is good, and of God, that is foun∣ded on Iesus Christ incarnate. And by this I might shew the error of many points of popish doctrine,Confutation of many ponts of Po∣pish doctrine. as their making Christ a Sauiour in vs by communicating merit to our workes, their mingling of his bloud with the bloud of the martyrs, in way of satisfa∣ction for sinne, their ioyning with him intercession of An∣gells
and Saints, and many other of like sort, wherin they exceedngly detract and derrogate from the honor of the kingly, Priestly, and Propheticall office of Christ, and so teach not sound doctrine, but I passe from them to the next wordes (admonishing) the originall worde (admoni∣shing) doth signifie propounding some thing that is amisse to the mind to be thought on,Interpreta∣tion. and to be corrected and a∣amended, and reprouing for the same, and teaching (that is) instructing euery one in the truth, what hee is to hould and beleeue (in all wisedome) that is, in true and perfect wisedome, it is vsuall in Scripture to put the note of vni∣uersality (all) to note excellency and perfection, thus then we are to conceiue these words, admonishing euery man (that is) setting before the minde of euery one what is a∣misse to be amended, and reprouing for the same, and in∣structing him in the truth what hee is to hold and beleeue euen in true and perfect wisedome. Heere first we are to mark the order of the words of the Apostle, hee sets admonition before teaching, admoni∣shing euery man teaching, hence ariseth this conclusion. That by the preaching of the word wee must first bee  brought to a sight of our sinnes, and then taught what to hold and beleeue.We must first be brought to a sight of our sinne by the preaching of the word, and then be taught how to come out of them. First we must be admonished and shewed our error and state of sinne, and made to see our sinne, and then instru∣cted how to come out of it, and in this order of teaching hath Christ himselfe gone before vs, Iohn 4. hee first shew∣ed the woman of Samaria her sinne, that she liued in adul∣tery before he taught her that he was the Messiah, & what she was to hold and beleeue touching him, we may obserue it in the sermon of Peter, Acts. 2. hee first laide before the Iewes their sinne, that they had slaine the Lord Iesus, and then vpon their touch and remorse of conscience, he said vnto them verse 38. amend your liues, and be baptized e∣uery one of you in the name of Iesus Christ, for the remissi∣on of sins, & ye shall receiue the gift of the holy ghost: if we
looke into the booke of God, wee shall find that this hath bin the order of all true Prophets, Apostles and teachers from time to time, and the reason is that which is giuen by the Apostle,  the Law is our Schoolemaster to bring vs to Christ, we must first be made to see our sinnes, & the dan∣ger of them without remedy, and so driuen from the law out of our selues to seeke remedy in the Gospell, and ther∣fore we must be admonished, and then instructed. The vse of this doctrine (besides the method that con∣cernes teachers) is this, it may serue as a rule of triall, wher∣by hearers of the word may try whether they haue truely profited by the preaching of the worde or no,Triall whe∣ther wee haue truly profited by the prea∣ching of the word or no. they may know by this, if they haue first beene brought to a sight of their sinnes, and truly humbled and cast downe, and af∣ter that brought to beleeue in Christ, for the pardon of their sins, then they haue truly profited by preaching, for as it is the right order of teaching, first to admonish and to shew sinne, and then to instruct, so it is the right order of receauing the worde taught, and profiting by it, and neuer any of Gods children were thoroughly comforted by the word, but they were first truly humbled by it, it is a preposterous and disordered course of learning to learne as some doe, that mercy and saluation comes by Christ, and with that to content themselues, not suffering them∣selues first to bee schooled by the law, till they dispaire in respect of themselues, & so come to Christ, and find com∣fort in him, and that we may be resolued of it, that it is (indeed) a preposterous course of learning: we must know that the very gate to true repentance, it is a true con∣trition and compunction of heart, a godly sorrow for sinne, for though it cannot bee denied, but that Gods free grace and mercy is the foundation of true repen∣tance,Note. repentance following Faith, not onely in time, but in the order of nature, yet first must the heart bee mollified, and by godly sorrow made pliable and fitte to receiue Gods grace, otherwise it will not enter, the
fallow ground of the heart, must first be plowed, and then the seed of Gods grace cast into it, as sayth the Prophet Ierem. 4.4. breake vp your fallow ground and sow not among thornes: therefore they are deceiued, who will needs be held truely repentant for their sinnes, and yet ne∣uer felt in their hearts any measure of godly sorrow; hap∣pily they haue had by a generall sight and sence of sinne, wrought by the word or iudgements of God, some light and vanishing touch of conscience, causing them to send foorth a naturall sigh or sob, but their hearts were neuer truely pressed downe with the waight of any one sinne, they skip ouer the first degree, and will needes bee graced with the highest degree of repentance, at the first, euen true conuersion and turning from sinne to God, which is a thing impossible, if we will be saued, we must know that godly sorrow for sinne is necessary, wee must euery one drinke his measure of that cup, we must first bee schooled by the Law, and feele the sharpe rod of that schoole ma∣ster, before we can come to be good schollers in the school of Christ, let euery one by this examine how he hath pro∣fited by the hearing of the word. We are in the place to marke, the Apostle sayth admo∣nishing  euery man &c. that which hence followeth is this, That the word preached admonishing and instructing teacheth all and euery one, of what calling, sexe, state or condition soeuer they be, and so ought to be heardThe word preached rea∣cheth all and euery one, and so ought to be heard. and re∣ceiued, whether it promise mercy, or threaten iudgement, we are to make vse of it to our selues particularly, it is com∣monly seene, if a priuiledge immunity or common bene∣fit, bee granted to any place, euery man will haue part in that; but if it bee a matter of charge, then they post it off to others; so if the word promise any mercy, euery man euen with vncleane hands will lay hold on that, but if the word be drawen out against any sin, the guilty person will commonly post that off to others; as if drunkennesse bee spoken against, hee that is guilty will see if hee can
spy any other in the congregation tainted with that fault,  and if he doe,Its a fault to post oft the reproofe of the word from our selues to others. then he thinkes the Preacher speakes to that other, and not himselfe. This is a sinne as ancient as Adams fall. Adam hee posted of his sinne to Eue, and Eue to the Serpent. Let vs take heed of this, it is a dangerous corruption, when a man is touched by the word, and his owne consci∣ence tels him his sinne is spoken against: then as wee vse to say, to set a good face on the matter, and to bite in all tokens of repentance, because hee would not haue it thought, that the word came so neere him, who so thus hardeneth his heart, may iustly feare, that heereafter hee cannot repent, they goe together, Rom. 2.5. after thine hardnesse and heart that cannot repent, and so hee shall heape vp wrath against the day of wrath. (In all wisdome) in that the Apostle saith, the matter of his teaching was true and perfect wisedome, he preaching Christ, and tea∣ching the Gospell of Christ; I might stand to shew the per∣fection and sufficiency of the word of the Gospell, that it is sufficient, and alone sufficient to make men truly wise vnto saluation, but I passe by that. In that the Apostle makes true and perfect wisedome, the particular matter of his teaching and instructing of e∣uery man, we may conclude that euery man truely wise,  hath his wisedome from the teaching of the word of God,Euery one truly wise hath his wise∣dome from the teaching of the word of God. no man is truely wise, but so farr foorth as he is taught by the word, and doth follow the teaching of the word, for why? the word is indeed true wisedome, the wisedome of God reuealed, manifesting such things as flesh and bloud was neuer able to reach vnto, therefore it must needes bee that no man is truely wise,  but as he is taught by the word, and doth follow the teaching of the word, and hath his wisdome as a streame flowing and deriued from the word; Hence it is that Moses sayd to the people,Deut. 4.5. I haue taught you ordinances and lawes, as the Lord my God comman∣ded me, that ye should doe euen so within the land, whi∣ther
ye go to possesse it, then verse 6. keepe them therfore and doe them, learne and follow them, for that is your wisedome, and Ieremy the Prophet, speaking of such as made no conscience to follow the teaching of the word,Ier. 8.9. saith, Lo, they haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wisedome is in them; as if he had sayd none at all. Would we then be truely wise,  no doubt euery one de∣sires it,If we would be truely wise our wisedome must come by the teaching of the word of God. Exod. 1.10. the most simple witted are loth to be counted foo∣lish, yea, the most wicked affect wisedome, Pharaoh and his counsell, though their cursed meeting sauoured of no∣thing but cruelty and bloud, yet they would shrowd it vn∣der the couert of wisedome; come let vs worke wisely with them, &c. but would we indeed be wise, let vs then looke that our wisdome come by the teaching of the word, that it be a streame issuing out of that fountaine, true wis∣dome comes not by the teaching of nature, by the rules of Art, or worldly pollicy, by obseruation of outward things, or common experience, a man may be exceeding wise according to these grounds, and yet haue not any dramme of true wisedome, but in the account of God himselfe, be a very foole, Luk. 12.20. the rich man there spoken of, was worldly wise, hee could get, saue, keepe, and thinke of laying vp his goods against time to come, and yet God sayd vnto him, thou foole, this night will they fetch away thy soule from thee, true wisedome is deriued on∣ly from the word, and euery man is so farre foorth wise, as he is taught by the word, and doth follow the teaching of the word. Now because euery one will bee ready to take this to himselfe, that his wisdome is deriued from the word, and that he according to the measure of his knowledge and grace, doth follow the teaching of the word. I hold it fit to lay downe some speciall notes and marke,Speciall note of true wise∣dome. by which we may know that our wisedome is (indeed) deriued from the word, and that our wisedome is taught by the holy Ghost, and to this purpose read Iam. 3. from ver. 13. to
the end of the chapter. It is there said that the wisedome that is from aboue, true and heauenly wisedome, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without iudging, and without hy∣pocrisie, these are the fruits that be in true wisedome, and issue out from it, heereby then we may trie whether we be wise by the teaching of the word and spirit or no, if our wisedome bring foorth purity, gentlenesse, easinesse to be entreated being offended &c. then is our wisedome true and heauenly: but on the contrary, if we be full of enuy∣ing and strife, and implacable, as many are that would bee reputed iolly wise men and women, they are full of enuy, yea, such as can neuer be appeased, being once (it may be without cause) offended, ready to beleeue euery flying tale, and to iudge amisse, certainely, then our wisedome is not from the teaching of the word, and descended from aboue, but earthly and fetcht from the pit of hell, yea, the more cunning we are to hide our malice, or to worke the hurt of our brethren by word or deed, the more foolish are wee, hath not Satan more subtilty and cunning to worke mischiefe, then all the men in the world, yet (indeed) he is the most foolish creature that is, for he doth nothing but worke his owne woe. Let vs therefore labour to bee wise by the teaching of the word, and that we be not deceiued, often remember wee the words of the Apostle, that true wisedome is pure, peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, &c. The last words of this verse containe the end of the A∣postles preaching (that we may present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus) the originall word translated (presnt) is iudi∣ciall borrowed from open courts and places of Iudgement,Interpreta∣tion. where men are brought and set before a Iudge to be tried and examined, and the Apostles meaning is, that we may set euery man at the great day of the Lord before his tri∣bunall and iudgement seat, (perfect) (that is) perfectly iust and holy, not onely in regard of iustice and righteous∣nesse
imputed (for so all true beleeuers are perfectly iust, in this life, he that truely beleeues in Christ, hath the per∣fection of the Law, and is as iust as if he had fulfilled the whole Law) but perfectly iust and holy in regard of righ∣teousnesse and holinesse inherent, and that perfect in de∣gree (in Christ Iesus) (that is) as a member of Christ, thus then the words are to be conceiued, that we may set euery man before the iudgment seat of God at the day of iudge∣ment, perfectly iust and and holy, not onely in regard of holinesse and righteousnesse imputed, but in regard of in∣herent holinesse and righteousnesse wrought in him by the Spirit of God as a member of Christ Iesus. Now heere we are first to marke that the Apostle saith, he and other Apostles preached Christ, admonished and taught men, not to make them perfect in regard of holi∣nesse inherent in this life, but to present them holy at the barre of Gods iudgement in the life to come, the point of instruction from hence is this, That we may in this life proceed from one measure of  faith as it is a quality, to another, and from one measure of holinesse to another, but wee cannot come to absolute perfectionWe may in this life pro∣ceed from one measure of faith and holinesse to a∣nother, but we cannot come to abso∣lute perfectiō. till this life bee ended Ephes. 4.13. the Apo∣stle saith plainely, that it cannot bee till wee all meet toge∣ther (in the vnity of faith and knowledge of the sonne of God) vnto a perfect man, and vnto the measure of the age of the fulnes of Christ, he there teacheth that the mi∣nistry of the word shall endure till we meet together, &c. giuing vs to vnderstand, that then it shall cease, now the Ministery of the worde shall not cease,1. Cor. 15.24. but conti∣nue as the same Apostle teacheth, till the end of the world, and therefore before the end of the world there shall bee no meeting together in the vnity of faith, nor any absolute perfection to bee hoped for, and the reason  of it is, that wee finde in 1. Cor. 13.9. wee know in part, there∣fore wee beleeue in part, and are sanctified but in part. The Apostle saith, Ph. 3.15. let as many as be perfect &c.
therefore perfection is to be had in this life? The Apostle there speakes not of absolute perfection, such as shall be in the life to come, of that he sayd ver. 12. that he had not yet attained to it, but hee speakes of a per∣fection in comparison, as perfection is opposed to weake∣nesse in knowledge or faith, and compared with it, & his meaning is, let as many as be strong in knowledge or faith be thus minded. The Authour to the Heb. cap. 5.14. saith, strong meat belongeth to them that are of age,  the word is (perfect) his meaning is of some maturity,Our duty is so long as we are in this life to goe on from one measure of grace to ano∣ther. and ripenes in knowledge; and through long custome had their wits ex∣ercised to discerne both good and euill; and therefore not∣withstanding this, it remaines a truth, that we may in this life proceed from one measure of faith and holinesse to a∣nother, but we can neuer come to an absolute perfection. The Anabaptists dreame of an absolute perfection of ho∣linesse in this life, but to passe by them, our duty following from hence is this, it behoues euery one of vs in this re∣gard, neuer to set downe our rest in any grace, but euer to be striuing forward, and to goe on from one measure of faith and grace to another, and to this purpose, wee are to propound vnto our selues, and to set before vs the best ex∣amples for our imitation,1. Cor. 11.1. as the Apostle saith, be ye followers of me▪ euen as I am of Christ; this is that which deceiues many of vs, we looke downeward and compare our selues, with such as are of meaner gifts and graces then our selues, and we thinke all is well, because we are not as the worst, though we neuer striue to come neere the best. Happily some of vs haue a measure of knowledge, and we rest in that knowledge, we know the Sacraments to be ho∣ly seales of Gods couenant of grace, but wee haue little or no care to vse them; we know prayer to be excellent, but we make no conscience to vse it, onely for fashion pub∣liquely, but very seldome priuately with our families, this is to set downe our rest in knowledge & not to striue to go on, and let vs take heed of it, if wee finde the loue of the
word and sacraments, the liking of praier, &c. that should be ioyned to our knowlege, stolne out of our hearts, wee haue cause to feare that sinne will deceiue vs, and creepe on to a further degree, euen to the hardning of our hearts, that wee shall not perceiue it, and to the blinding of our mindes that we shall not see it. We may not thinke that Sodome, Saul, Iudas and such like were at the height of their sinne at the first, but they went on by degrees, from one degree of sinne to another; and certainly, if wee goe not forward in grace we goe backeward, and we grow in sinne; and going on in sinne, we shall come at length to be hard∣ned, and to the height of sinne, and so pull downe the wrath of God vpon vs. Let this therefore stirre vs vppe, not to set downe our rest in any grace, but let vs striue to goe on from know∣ledge to practise, and from one measure of grace to ano∣ther. Note we one thing more in a word, in that the Apostle saith, present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus &c. wee  may gather that the state of perfection is not proper to some sorts and orders of men,The state of perfection is not proper to some sorts & orders of men. as the Papists teach, but e∣uery member of Christ is perfect, in respect of righteousnes imputed in this life, and shall be perfect in regard of holi∣nesse inherent in the life to come. But the Papists distinguish and say there be two kindes of perfection, a lesse, consisting in keeping the Law ne∣cessary to saluation; a greater, in obseruing the counsels of Christ, not simply necessary to saluation,Confutation of popish di∣stinctions touching per∣fecton. but to ob∣taine a greater degree of glory, this distinction is most absurd. For first counsels be commandements, and againe, can there be a greater perfection, then an absolute fulfilling of the Law? it is not possible. If any man be able to fulfill the Law of God, he is most perfect, he is in that respect perfect according to the exam∣ple of Christ: therefore there can bee no greater perfecti∣on,
it is absurd to say there can be no greater perfection. VER. 29. Whereunto I also labour and striue, according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. In this verse the Apostle setteth downe. First, what hee did in respect of the end of his preach∣ing before spoken of, (namely that hee did labour and striue to attaine that end (Whereunto I also labour and striue. Secondly, by what power hee so laboured, not by his owne, but by the working power of Christ (according to his working.) Then followeth the subiect of that working power wherein it wrought, and was effectuall (namely) himselfe (which worketh in me.) To which is added the measure, how much it wrought in him, in the last word (mightily) Interpreta∣tion.Whereunto (that is) vnto which thing formerly spoken of, I also (that is) for my part labour and striue; the words are (labour striuing) the meaning is, to which end I con∣tend, not onely with labour and paines, seruing to that purpose, and tending to that end, but with wrestling and striuing against all aduersary power that doth oppose a∣gainst it, to hinder the attainement of that end. Thus then these first words are to be conceiued. Vnto which thing I for my part endeauour and contend, not onely labouring and doing such things as tend to that purpose, but striuing against all things that oppose it, and hinder the attaine∣ment of that end. Now heere we are to marke, that the Apostle saith not, that hee barely propounded this as the end of his preach∣ing and admonishing, that hee might present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus: but hee did labour and striue to attaine it; hence wee may take vp this generall conclu∣sion.
That euery man in his personall and particular calling,  wherein hee is set for the glory of God,Euery man is to doe the du∣ties of his par∣ticular calling with dili∣gence. and the good of men, is to doe the duties of his calling with diligence, hee is not onely to doe the duties appertaining to his place, after the example of the Apostle, to doe them with labour and paine, breaking through all difficulties, and all things that stand vp against him, to hinder him in the diligent performance of them. Eccles. 9.10. the Prea∣cher sayth, all that thine hand shall finde to doe, doe it, with all thy power: not onely doe it, but doe it, with all thy power; as if hee had sayd, follow the workes of thy vocation, and employ all the powers of the minde, a∣bout the discharging of it faithfully, Paul biddes him that ruleth, not onely to rule, but with diligence, and e∣uery man that hath an office or calling, to wayt on it with care and diligence, Rom. 12.7.8. the reasons of thus duty are two. First because it is appointed to man by Gods order, laid  on him presently after the fall, that he should not only la∣bour and trauell, but with paines.Gen. 3.19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou returne to the earth, that is, till thy death. Secondly, because the Lord hath given vnto man both  a body and a minde, that both these might be vsed and em∣ployed in the workes of his calling, that he should do them not onely with his body, for so do bruit beasts, the oxe & the asse; but man must doe the workes of his calling with his body and with earnest intention of his minde, and so with care and diligence. Wee see then the duty prooued, and the reasons of it; but that wee bee not deceiued in the practise of it,2. Rules. two rules must further bee remembred. First, our diligence in doing the duties of our cal∣lings, must bee with respect to the will and commande∣ment of God, for diligence is required by his comman∣dement, and wee are to bee diligent in performing
the duties of our callings, in conscience and obedience to Gods will and commandement, not for pride, couetous∣nesse or vpon compulsion, or other by respects, as doe the duties of their callings in these respects painfully may be sayd to be great workers, but nothing diligent. Secondly, our diligence must be with direction of our labours to the end of our callings, in the diligent perfor∣mance of our duties, wee must driue at the end of our personall callings, that wee may attaine that end. The example of our Apostle in this place doth teach thus much, hee was called to preach the Gospell, that hee might pre∣sent some perfect in Christ Iesus, and to that end did he employ his whole strength and endeauour; so must we in our particular places and callings; for example, a ma∣ster of a family, he that is called to bee a master and gouer∣nour ouer others, must not onely in a family be diligent, in gouerning his wife, children and seruants, for that may bee done for his owne profit and commodity, which (in∣deed) is not vnlawfull, a man may reape the fruit of the la∣bours of those that be vnder him;Psal. 129.2. but that must not be the scope and drift of his diligent administration and go∣uernement: but hee must therein driue at the preserua∣tion and good of the bodies and soules of those that bee vnder him; that is the end of his particular calling. I might insist in other particulars, but by this wee may see our duety, and the manner of the practise of it, wee must not onely doe the duties of our callings, but with care and diligence, and with diligence rightly orde∣red, (namely) with a respect to Gods will, and with direction of our labour, to the end of our personall callings. Let vs now heare something that may stirre vs vp to the practise of this duty,We are to practise the duty of dili∣gence in our callings. and to this purpose much might bee sayd, as that diligence in doing the dueties of our callings, is a meanes by the blessing of God vpon them, to make rich, Prou. 10.4. yea, a meanes to keepe from
vngodly company, sinnefull exercises, and all kinde of vnthrifty courses, yea, a remedy against pride, and helping to worke humility, and so making a way to all good pro∣sperity; but as a motiueA Motiue. most powerfull consider we only this one thing. That diligence in doing the duties of our generall cal∣ling as we are Christians, diligence in hearing the word, receiuing the Sacraments,Note. without diligence in doing the duties of our personall callings is but meere hypo∣crisie. If a master of a family, or his wife bee ready and wil¦ling to heare the word, to receiue the Sacraments, &c. and yet one of those be loose and wretchlesse in the ad∣ministration and gouernment of his family, and the o∣ther carelesse in the practise of priuate obedience and sub∣iection to her owne husband, surely, they haue but an out∣ward forme and shew of religion, as the Apostle sayth,2. Tim. 3.5. without the power thereof. For the true practise of the du∣ties of the first table of the commandements, is seene and doth appeare in the practise of the duties of the second table, our loue to God appeares in our loue to our brethren &c. we truly serue God, in doing seruice vnto our brethren in the duties of our particular callings, as the Apostle doth shew chap. the 3. of this Epistle ver. 24. in the example of seruants, that seruants in doing true seruice to their masters they serue the Lord. If then we would auoyd the odious and foule sinne of hypocrisie, which is hatefull to God and men, to whom it is knowen, and hath the portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone. Let vs bee stirred vp to doe the duties of our particular callings with diligence, euen in conscience to the com∣mandements of God, euer ayming at the end of our cal∣lings, that so we may assure our owne soules, and testifie to the world, that our hearts are vpright and sincere in the feare and seruice of God.
The next thing wee are to marke from these words is this, the Apostle takes to himselfe labour and striuing to win soules to present them perfect in Christ Iesus, but no more, not the effecting or bringing of that to passe. Hence we are taught, that knowen conclusion, that the Ministers of the Gospell may labor and striue to win soules to God, but they can goe no further, they cannot effect it,Ministers of the Gospell can onely la∣bour & striue to win soules to God but they cannot effect it. 1. Cor. 3.6. Paul may plant, Apollos may water, but God giueth the encrease. And the reason of this is, that which is common to all callings, the fruit of mens labour in their callings is,  from the blessing of the Lord, Except the Lord build the house they labour in vaine that built it:Psal. 127.1. so except the Lord giue a blessing to the ministry of the word, Ministers labour and striue but in vaine. And this point being fore-knowen, it may arme and strengthen the Minister against discomfort, that might follow vpon it, he shall labour and striue to winne men to God, and see little fruit of his labours,Strength a∣gainst dis∣comfort when a Mini∣ster sees little fruit of his labours. yea, the friut of the selfe same word by him deliuered to one and the same peo∣ple, so diuers, that some regard it and do thereafter, others neglect it and doe contrary, Moses himselfe had experience of this, Exod. 9.20.21. Againe, it is so, that the Minister may labour and striue to bring men to God in vaine,We must take heed the cause be not in our selues that we finde not Gods blessing on the ministry of his word. vnlesse it please God to giue a blessing to his labours, then let vs take heed there bee no iust cause in vs, why the Lord should withhold his blessing from vs in the ministry of the word, and in his iust iudgement giue vs ouer to the blindnesse of our minds and hardnesse of our hearts, that we can neither see, feele, nor vnderstand to saluation, and that is when wee haue not a loue to the word, but are hypocrits and such as heare onely for fashion, and of custome, and haue not a longing desire to profit; such as come on this sort to the hearing of the word, the Lord doth not blesse their hearing, but doth suffer them to go on in a most fearefull dul∣nesse. Examples of this there bee many in the world,
and no doubt wee may easily poynt out some, who haue heard their owne particular sinne discouered by the Mi∣nistry of the word, and that sinne spoken against, and the greatnesse and danger of it layd before them, and yet they are bold to continue in that sinne, and to goe on in it, and what is the cause of this? surely, because they heard onely of fashion and custome, the Lord did not blesse their hea∣ring. It is iust with the Lord as the Apostle hath taught, 2. Thess. 10.11.12. When men receiue not the truth in loue of the truth, to send them strong delusion that they should beleeue lies, & to giue them ouer to the blindnesse of their mindes, and hardnesse of their hearts. Let this therefore be thought on, and let it stirre vs vp to come to the hearing of the word with loue to the word, and a de∣sire to profit by it, that so the Lord in mercy, may strike an holy stroake within vs by his powerfull Spirit, that wee may be bettered by it. Come we to speake of the power, by which the Apostle did labour and striue, layd downe in these words (accor∣ding to his working) the meaning is,Interpreta∣tion. according to the working power of Iesus Christ. For wee finde both these conioyned Ephes. 3.7. the Apostle sayth, hee was made a Minister, by the gift of the grace of God, giuen vnto him through the working of his power, where we see working and power ioyned together. For better cleering of these words, know, that the power of God is either absolute, by which hee is able to doe more then hee will; or it is actuall, by which hee doth what hee will. And this actuall power we are to vn∣derstand in this place, and so the meaning is, according to the working, or actuall, or effectuall power of Iesus Christ. The poynt of instruction hence to bee gathered is this. In that the Apostle sayth, he did labour and striue in his ministry according to rhe working power of Christ, thence we are taught this generall conclusion.
That the power to labour and take paines, not only in the ministry, but in any place or calling, in any trade of life, it is from the actuall working power of the Lord;Power to la∣bour and to take paines in any calling is from the actu∣all power of God. yea, wisedome and skill to worke in manuarie trades is not naturall, nor gotten by paines, though paines sanctified and blessed are meanes to attaine it, yet they are but meanes, and the fountaine of that cun∣ning and skill is the working power of the Lord. Exod. 31.34. wee haue a plaine proofe of this, the Lord saith, he had filled Bezaleell with the spirit of God, in wisedome and in vnderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all workman∣ship, and not onely that cunning and skill as the first gift, but wee are further to marke, that all encrease and going forward in the same skill was from him. The Lord saith, it was of him and from him, that Bezaleell should be able to finde out curious workes, to worke in gold, and in sil∣uer, and in brasse, (that is) to deuise more and more eue∣ry day, Pro. 20.12. the wise man sayth, the Lord hath made both these, euen the eare to heare, and the eye to see. Which words not onely prooue that the power to do any duty is from the Lord, but they containe the ground of it, and the meaning of them is thus much, that the Lord hath not onely formed all the parts of mens bodies, and (namely) these two, the eare, and the eye, but he it is who enableth and quickneth them to their seuerall office and function, as he saith to Moses Exod. 4.11. he hath gi∣uen the mouth and speech to man, therefore all power to labour in any place or calling is from the actuall working  power of the Lord. I doubt not but this is a knowen and confessed truth, let vs therefore make some profitable vse of it. And first it may teach publike persons, Magistrates and Ministers, not to looke at themselues, at their owne po∣wer, or rather at their owne weakenesse, but with com∣fort to looke to the power of the Lord in the discharge of their duties,Publike per∣sons are not to looke at their owne power, but to the power of the Lord in discharge of their duties. it is an engrafted weakenesse in mans nature,
when any great or difficult thing is to be taken in hand, to be fearing and doubting and euer casting perils and dan∣gers. Thus was it with Ionas, Ieremy and Moses, and ma∣ny others. Men are indeede to consider their owne weakenesse, to humble them withall, but yet being called to per∣forme any publique duety, they are then to remember though they bee weake, yet the Lord hee is strong, and euer able to stregthen them, and for their comfort, they are to remember that sweete promise of the Lord to Moses, vppon acknowledgement of his owne weake∣nesse Exod. 3.12. I will bee with thee, as if hee had sayd, I doe not say, that I will helpe thee nowe and then, but I will bee with thee, euer and continually, I will ayde thee in this worke, euen I, and not any Angell of mine, but I my selfe, and therefore feare not. This is a notable encouragement to publike persons in the doing of their duties. Againe, is it so, that power to labour in any trade  or calling is from the working power of the Lord.We must ac∣knowledge our strength and skill to labour in our callings to come from the Lord. We must then learne to acknowledge it to come from the Lord, that wee haue strength or skill to labour in our callings, and that our acknowledgement of it, bee not verball, onely in word, and of course, but that our owne hearts may witnesse with vs, wee doe in truth acknow∣ledge it, wee must often send vp prayer to Heauen for strength to labour, yea, in the midst of our greatest a∣bility, for wee haue need of continuall supply of strength, as the light of a lampe hath neede of oyle to mainetaine it; and when wee haue strength giuen, we are to be thank∣full to God for it, vsing both it and the fruit of our strength and labors to the glory of God, and the good of our selues and others. Many men are defectiue in this duety, they neuer ac∣knowledge the power they haue to labour, to bee from
the Lord, happily in word, they doe if the question bee made to themselues, whether they doe acknowledge their strength, to labour to come from the Lord or no, they will answer certainely they doe, but indeed and truth they doe not, for finding themselues lusty and strong to worke, and to take paines, they presume vpon their strength and seldome or neuer call vpon God for a blessing vppon it, and for continuall supply of strength, and the Lord not∣withstanding suffering them to enioy the fruit of their strength and labours, hee being wonderfull in goodnes, they seldome or neuer open their mouths, to giue thanks to the Lord; no, they commonly ascribe the fruit of their labours to their owne strength, as the Prophet Habakkuk 1.16. sayth of the wicked of his time, they sacrifice to their owne net, and that they get by their labours, they abuse and spend riotously and wastfully, as fast as it comes in; the Lord therefore hath lately pinched such vnthank∣full vnthrifts, hee being Lord of all creatures, hee hath by the late hard weather, by the extreame frost,The great rost in the yeere 1607. bound vppe their hands, that they could not worke, and so hath set it before them (if they will not wilfully shut their eyes) they may see whence they haue power to labour; I know the Diuell the teacher of all the vngodly, will bee ready to suggest that this binding of mens hand by the weather was common to all good and bad; it is true, but I make no doubt of it, but that such as truely feare the Lord, found that of the Psalmist true, Psal. 33.18.19. that the eye of the Lord was vpon them, to deliuer their soules from death, and to preserue them in famine, or if they were pinched with others, yet it was in mercy, not in iudgement, and onely vngodly vnthrifts, such as neuer acknowledge their strength to labour to come from the Lord, they felt smart and were pinched in iudgement, and forced to mutter add murmure, and to fall to vngod∣ly excuses. Let this then teach vs euer to acknowledge the strength
we haue to labour to come from the Lord, doubtlesse wee may obserue it when men doe not acknowledge God the authour of their strength, the Lord in his iust iudgement strikes them with sickenesse, blindnesse, lamenesse some way or other disabling them, he wil be honoured in all his gifts, either by acknowledgement of them, or by the con∣fusion of such as will not thankfully acknowledge them. Let vs then learne to acknowledge what power or skill so euer we haue in our trades and callings that it is giuen of God, that so we may vse it to his glory, and to the good of our selues and others, and find his blessing vpon it, with∣out which, our best strength turnes to weakenes. Come we to the subiect of the working power of Christ (namely) the Apostle himselfe (which worketh or is effectu∣all in me) that we are to marke from these words is this.3. The sub∣iect. The Apostle saith not, the power of Christ wrought and was effectual with him, but in him, or as some expound the words, by him, whence it followeth. That neither the Apostle was, nor any minister of the  word now is, a co-worker, a fello-worker, with the power of God; as adding any power to his power, in the win∣ning of soules,Neither Apo∣stle nor any minister of the word is a co-worker with the power of God in the winning of soules. but onely is as an instrument in the hand of so powerfull a workeman, the actuall power of God, doth worke in and by his ministers in gayning of soules to himselfe, hence it is that the Apostle saith; 2. Corinth. 13.3. that Christ did speake in him, not with him, see∣ing that yee seeke experience of Christ,  that speaketh in mee, which towards you is not weake,Wee must as∣cribe that grace and ho∣linesse that is wrought in men by the ministry of the word and Sacraments wholly to the power of God. but is mighty in you, he takes not so much as speech or power to speake to himselfe, but ascribes it altogether vnto Christ, when therefore wee see grace and holinesse conuaid into mens harts by the ministery of the word, and sacraments, wee must learne not to ascribe it to any working power of the minister or the elements, but wholly to the supream pow∣er of almighty God. But may some say, doth not the Apostlle, 1. Cor. 15.10.
say hee laboured, and yet not hee, but the grace of God which was in him, doth not hee then affirme a power in himselfe, and of himselfe, and the grace of God to worke with him; indeede the Papists they abuse that place, and would force it to prooue a concurring of Free-will, with Gods grace in our conuersion. But that is cleane from the purpose of the Apostle, as may appeare by the context, for he there speakes only of his labours that he sustained in preaching the Gospell, but to satisfie such as make this obiection, we are to marke the Apostle saith not, the grace of God which laboureth with me, as if partly he, and partly the grace of God had labou∣red, but which is with me, as if he had said, I laboured more then they all, and then by way of correction, he cals him∣selfe backe, yet what said I, I, no not I, but altogether the grace of God which is present with mee in the preaching of the Gospell, thus we are to vnderstand the words of the Apostle, the Papists in their translation cunningly leaue out the Article, which is in the originall, and so corrupt the text, and abuse their followers. 4. The mea∣sure.Now the Apostle in the last wordes addeth the mea∣sure of Christ his working in him, that the power of  Christ wrought in him (mightily) as indeede it did, you may see it,The Lord worketh mightily by weake means of grace. if you read Rom. 15, 18.19. we are taught not to looke at the outward man in the ministery of the word, or the outward elements in the Sacraments, for the ministry of the word is exercised by weake and mortall men and the outward elements, bread, wine, and water are weak and common dead creatures in themselues,  yet the Lord wor∣keth mightily by them. The vse of this in a word is thus much, wee therefore are to know that Gods fauour and grace is euer ready to bee found, when it is faithfully sought in the vse of the worde and Sacraments,Gods grace & fauour is euer ready to bee found beeing faithfully sought, in the vse of the word and sa∣craments. our faith can neuer take the Lord tardy, in giuing grace by his holy ordinances, the ministery of the word and Sacraments, hee worketh in them, and by
them mightily, his power is euer present in the right vse of them, the messengers in the Gospell. Luk. 14.17. say not to them that were bidden, be there at such a time, and in the meane while things shall be made ready, or goe with mee now, and supper will bee ready anone, but come, for all things are ready, grace is now ready, & now prepared for them that seeke it in the right vse of the worde and Sacra∣ments, and if we haue failed to obtaine grace and comfort by the word and Sacraments, wee are to impute it to our selues, and not to lay the blame vpon the ordinances of God, they are not barren of vertue and power, but wee were wanting in Faith and repentance, and o∣ther duties by which we should haue beene better prepared.
THE SECOND CHAPTER. VERSE 1. For I would ye knew what great fighting I haue for your sakes, and for them of Laodicea, and for as many as haue not seene my person in the flesh. THe Apostle in the former Chapter, hauing declared the doctrine deli∣uered to the Colossians, to be agree∣able to the truth, and perswaded to continuance in the same. In this se∣cond chapter hee doth shew them that they ought carefully to auoide all other corrupt doctrines whatso∣euer, whereby false teachers would obtrude, and thrust vp∣on them any thing besides Christ, or any thing with Christ as a meanes of saluation, whether out of Philoso∣phy, or the Law of Moses. That is the generall proposition and matter that is handled in this chapter.The generall proposition and matter of this chapter. The parts of this text three.The parts of it are three. 1 First an Exordium, an entrance depending vpon that
that which went before in the first and second verse. Then two generall propositions. 1 First, that in Christ wee haue full and perfect knowledge needfull to saluation and that in the third verse. 2 Secondly that all other things are meer deceit and vanity vers 4. And both these are amplified by many argu∣ments and particulars perswading to imbrace the one and to auoid the other, and interming∣led through the chapter, we shall best see them in the passage and particular handling of the chapter. Come we to the wordes of the first (For I would, &c.) these wordes looke backe to the last verse of the former chapter as a preoccupation or preuention of an obiection. The Colossians might say, Paul thou dost labour & striue much in preaching the Gospell, but what is that to vs, thou neuer sawest vs, nor wee thee, all thy labour and paines is nothing to vs: this obiection the Apostle meetes withall when he saith. I would ye knew what great fighting I haue for your sakes, &c. Heere we haue 1 First, the Apostles desire that his labour and fighting might bee knowne in the first word (for I would ye knew what great fighting I haue, &c. 2 Secondly, for whom it was, in particular, namely for the Colossians, and them of Laodicea. 3 And then generally for as many as haue not seene my person in the flesh. For I would ye knew what great fighting I haue, onely the word (fighting) is to bee cleered and explaned, it is metaphorical, borrowed from such as withstand assault,Interpreta∣tion. or open violence and hostility, such as with all their strength set themselues against the power and violence of open e∣nemies, fighting doth implie opposition and the Apostle doth thereby signifie his spirituall striuing, his earnest care
and pains he look to withstand the enemies of the Church, Satan and his instruments, and that by his sufferings wher∣of he spake chap. 1.24. And by his earnest prayers, as hee saith, chap. 4.12. Epaphras did striue in prayers for the Co∣lossians, by his writings and reasonings, in way of confu∣tation of all aduersaries of the truth, so much is implied in the word (fighting). Thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of the Apostle. I would ye knew what care and paines I take for you in withstanding Satan, and the enemies of the trueth, and of your saluation by my sufferings, prayers, writings, and rea∣sonings against them. The first thing heere to be obserued is this: the Apostle was not content to haue an earnest care and contention, for the good of the Colossians, and other Churches, but he made it knowne to them I would ye knew it, saith the A∣postle, he thought it no shame ro tell them that hee loued them, and had an earnest care and striuing for their good, the conclusion following hence is this. It is lawfull to make known, and to speak of our christi∣an loue to others,It is lawfull to make knowne and to speake of our Chri∣stian loue to o∣thers. & of our care for their good, a man may lawfully speake of it, and make it knowne that hee hath a loue, and christian care for the good of others, if so be in speaking of it he set before him the glory of God, and the good of men, as no doubt but the Apostle did in this place and we may obserue it to be very frequent and vsuall with the Apostle, to speake of his loue and care for the good of Gods Church, when he knew the speaking of it might re∣dound to Gods glory, and the good of his people 1. Cor. 12.11.12.13.14.15. he saith he ought to haue bin com∣mended of them, for in nothing was he inferiour vnto the very chiefe Apostles, &c. hee makes known that he had an exceeding loue & care for the good of that Church. Thus may we doe, wee may speake of our loue and care ouer o∣thers, that God may therby be glorified, and our brethren bettered, beeing thereby stirred vp to answere our loue a∣gaine,
and to praise God for it; and there is reason  for this because euery grace and good gift, as loue, and care for the good of others, and the like, is a portion of Gods name, therein appeares the power, vertue, and goodnes of God, in working that loue and care in the hearts of men. Ther∣fore it not only may, but ought to be published and made knowne to this end, that God therein may bee honoured, and if we ought as (it is our duty) as occasion is offered, to speake of the beauty, sweetnesse, colour and brightnesse that is found in the creatures, that glory may redound to God the giuer of those things, much more when occasion is offerred, that thereby God may be glorified, ought wee to speake of our loue to others, and of our care for their good, those things beeing more excellent in themselues, and giuen for better vse and purpose.  I shall not neede to vrge this point,Things to bee auoided in speaking of our loue to o∣thers. for the matter of it euery man (no doubt) is most ready to blase, and to set abroad, and to amplifie that loue hee beares to others, and that care hee hath for their good, yea some deale in this respect as Absalom did, 2. Sam. 15, 4. they speake of loue and care towards others, that is not in them, as if they loued them exceedingly, and cared much for their good, thereby to insinuate, and get within the loue and liking of others, and to get the good word of others. These boasters are reckoned vp by the Apostle in the ranke and rabble of reprobates Rom. 1.30, or else if there be in them a care for the good of others, they speake of it as the Pharisee speakes of his fasting, and giuing of tithes, Luk. 18.11. with disparagement, and with disgrace of others, that if they were in such a place, or in such an of∣fice, they would haue men to know, that they would deale better then others doe, and so they cunningly seeke their owne praise by other mens disgrace, which is a grosse cor∣ruption, and a breach of the ninth commandement, wee may lawfully speake of our loue and care ouer others, so as therin we seeke not our owne praise, but the glory of God, if praise be giuen of God and godly men, we may lawfully
accept it,Note. the Lord hath promised to crowne with honour, and estimation among men, them that honor him 1. Sam. 2.30. Therefore it is not to be declined, the true children of God may accept praise giuen, yea honour and dignity in the world,Psay. 14.14. so their minds be humble, and they haue lear∣ned S. Pauls lesson, 2. Corin. 6.8. to vse aright honour and dishonour, but they are not to seeke it by speaking of the good things that be in them, for so doing they seeke to set themselues aboue the Lord, and to ascend aboue the height of the clouds, and to aduance their glory aboue the glory of the Lord, which ought to be sought aboue the saluation of their owne soules. The next thing to be marked is, that the Apostle saith not, know that I haue a great fighting for you, &c. But I would haue you to know, it is my desire that you should know it, and his desire being holy and good doth affoord this point of instruction. That it is good for men to know, and acknowledge the loue and care that others,It is good for men to know and acknow∣ledge that loue and care that publike persons haue ouer them, & for them. especially ministers and publike persons, haue ouer them, and for them, if there be a care in the ministers of the Gospell to doe vs good, and that ma∣nifested by any meanes, by preaching, writing, praying, admonition, or any other way, it is good for vs to take no∣tice of it and to acknowledge it. Our Sauiour saith by way of pittifull complaint ouer Ierusalem, Luk. 19.42. If thou hast euen knowne, at the least in this thy day, those things which belong vnto thy peace, as if he had said I am in pitty and compassion towards thee, wish thou haddest knowne these things that concerne thy peace, spoken vnto thee by the Prophets in former times, or at least the things offered by me in this thy day, concerning thy peace, but a∣lasse thou wouldst not take knowledge of them; therefore now they are hid from thine eyes: see againe how the Lord doth complaine of his people, Ezechiel. 12.9. Sonne of man (saith he) hath not the house of Israell, the rebellious house said vnto thee, what dost thou? as if he should haue
said, how stupid and how sencelesse is this people, that yet will not acknowledge thy care to instruct them by this manifest similitude, for the Lord hath bidden the Pro∣phet verse 3. to prepare his staffe to goe vp into captiuity, and he saith goe forth by day in their sight: and thou shalt passe from thy place to another place in their sight, if it were possible that they might consider with the Prophet how they might escape the captiuity threatned, yet when the Prophet had done, they considered not his care to in∣struct them, but stood as men amazed, and said what dost thou? and of this doth the Lord complaine; therefore it is good to know, to acknowledge, and to consider the loue, and care that others, and especially the ministers of the Gospell haue ouer vs for our good; and there is reason for it,  it is a meanes to giue way and entrance to the speech of such as speake vnto vs, or doe any thing for our good, to make their good words and accounts acceptable and pro∣fitable vnto vs, when we know and acknowledge them to be words and deedes, not of course but of conscience pro∣ceeding of loue and care towards vs, it will make vs so to esteeme of them, and take profit by them. A lesson indeed that is not well learned of many in the world,  some there be; that when they are iustly reprooued for their sinnes,Reproofe of them that will not take no∣tice of the ten¦der care of their mini∣sters ouer thē when out of loue they iust∣ly reproue thē as vsury, extortion and such like, and that in a tender care o∣uer them for their good, are so farre from acknowledging that reproofe to come from any loue towards them, as they begin to quarrell with the affection of the reproouer, and sticke not to mutter it in corners, that they are hardly dealt withall, and vnreasonably reprooued, yea some∣times they seeke by recrimination, and by vniust accusa∣tion to blemish them that would wipe away their foule blots. And thus they shew themselues such as the wise man speakes of Prouerbs 9.7. hee that rebuketh the wicked getteth himselfe a blotte; others againe are like to Lots sonnes in Law Gen. 19.14. who (as there wee read) when
Lot spake vnto them to get them out of Sodom in care o∣uer them for their good, hee seemed to them as though he had mocked, so some when they are told of their sins, and withall shewed that iudgement hangs ouer their heads for the same, they thinke men that doe so tell them doe but dreame, and are troubled with some melancholike passi∣ons, and it is neither so nor so: well, let such as will not now acknowledge the loue and care of them that labour to do them good by reproouing them for their sinnes, or shewing the iudgements of God due to their sinnes know, that the Lord by his mighty working, will so bring to pase that in their extremities they shall bee forced to acknow∣ledge it, then they shall iustifie the loue of such as did for∣merly reprooue them, and then they shall wish for their prayers as Pharaoh did for the prayers of Moses and Ar when the hand of God was vpon him, Exodus 8.8. And as the stubborne Israelites did the prayer of Samuell whom not long before they neglected, 1. Sam. 12.19. yea wick∣ed Ieroboam in case of extremity sends to the Prophet, whose doctrine he would not follow, and no worse mes∣senger then his owne wife, 1. Kings. 14.1. and may wee not obserue it that many who (at other times) regard no what the ministers of the Gospell say vnto them in tender care for their good, yet in time of extremity are forced by the omnipotent hand of God, to send and to seeke vn∣to them for comfort, and then many times in the iust iudgement of God they are left in their misery, and are not able to take hold of any comfort that is ministred, the Lord hauing so threatned, Prou. 1.26. that he will laugh at their destruction, meaning that hee in the course of hs prouidene will leaue them in their miseries, & make them a mocking stock to the world, doth not dayly and laen∣table experience teach thus much, let it then stirre vs vp to take notice and to acknowledge the loue & care of such a labour amongst vs for our good, be it but in poor & wea measure, and in testimony of our true acknowledgment of
it, let vs labour to take profit by it, for it is not enough to cry out with the woman in the Gospell Luke 11.27. bles∣sed is the wombe that bare thee, & the paps which thou hast sucked, to commend the gracious words, the person or the gifts of loue, care, or zeale that is found in them that seeke our good, no, no saith our Sauiour blessed are they that heere these wordes, and doe them, the heathen man could say lauda vt videam, praise me that I may see it, that is the best acknowledgement of any grace in other men manifested, seruing for our good, to giue testimony that we like it, and that is the best testimony of our liking of it if we be bettered by it. The next thing to be marked in the Apostles desire ex∣pressed in these words is that he doth expresse his care and the paines he tooke vnder the word (fighting) a word that doth imply opposition, & in this place doth signifie a spiri∣rituall withstanding of violence offered by the enemies of the truth, the Apostle expressing a speciall part of his care and paines vnder the notion of (fighting) doth giue vs to vnderstand thus much for our instruction. That the trueth of the Gospell hath euer had some to  withstand it:The trueth of the Gospell hath euer had some to with∣stand it. no sooner was the true doctrine of the Gospell published by the Apostles of Christ, and the true teachers of it, but false Apostles, deceiuers and teachers of error presently start vp in opposition and con∣tradiction to it, and so the Apostles were put to a second and double labour, to teach the trueth, and to withstand errour springing vp after the trueth like the builders of the walls of Ierusalem, Nehemiah 4.17. who builded with one hand, and with the other held the sword, it was the occasion of the writing of this Epistle, and of that to the Galathians, that vpon the preaching of the truth, and plan∣ting the Gospell among them, they were in danger to bee seduced by false teachers, examples of this kind are infinit and ecclesiasticall histories of all times and ages, are full fraught with such examples, wee reade in the booke of
God, that together with the doctrine of piety, and religi∣on there sprung vp the doctrine of the Nicholaitanes, of Balaam, of Iesabell, and of those abhominable and cursed men that crept into the Church, whom Peter and Iude, do point out in their Epistles, and warne men to take heed of them and diuers others, there were men in the Church of Corinth thrust out by Satan, that tooke vpon them to de∣fend feasting with Idolaters in idoll temples, with meates offered to idolls, and by their subtill cauilling wits, helped forward by the Deuill, tooke on them to prooue that they were not defiled by eating those meates, or by bodily for∣nication: in whose steed after the Apostles times succee∣ded the Valentinians and other heretikes, yea come we to our owne times, we shall find that so soone as euer the light of the Gospell shined and dispelled the darkenes of pope∣ry, the deuill set on foot many dangerous errors by Ana∣baptists, Libertines, the family of loue, and other such monsters. And the reason  is that which wee finde Iohn 8.44 because the Deuill himselfe aboade not still in the truth (that is) as some learned and Orthodoxall expound it, not in the trueth of the eternall and euerlasting Gos∣pell of Christ, made knowne vnto the Angells from the beginning of the world, in that trueth the Deuill and the euill Angells would not rest, but choose ra∣ther to forsake their originall and first state Iude 6. ver. then they would subscribe and yeeld vnto it, hence it is that the Deuill hath in former times, and doth now, and euer shall to the ende of the world continually raise vp, and scatter abroad lying heresies against the Deity; hu∣manity and offices of Christ, against the trueth, and sub∣stance of the Gospell, and labour what hee can by his e∣uill suggestions to seduce men, and to draw them from yeelding assent to the truth of the Gospell, yea in the ende making them stand vp in opposition, & contradiction to it, we see this point proued that the Gospels truth hath had
and alwaies shall haue some to withstand and contra∣dict it. Many at this day are offended that errours and strange opinions spring vp together with the preaching of the gospell and take occasion thereby to slander and deface it,  but let them know that by this reason they might as well condemne the preaching of the Apostles,We are not to be offended that errors & strange opini∣ons spring vp together with the preaching of the Gospel. yea the Papists knew it well that errors and heresies begun to sprout vp, and to shew themselues in the Apostles time, and that shortly after their times, the Church was euery where grie∣uously rent and tormented by monstrous heretikes & fil∣thy persons, yet they shame not to obiect it as a vile re∣proach against vs, that such things do spring vp where the Gospell is preached indeed they consider not whom they reproach, for they reproach not onely vs, but whole Chur∣ches of old, euen Churches planted by the Apostles, and the Lord himselfe, we may not take it to bee no true Gos∣pell, nor right preaching, nor no true Church where errors and oppositions arise, but rather acknowledge it to be the same Gospell that was preached by the Apostles, seeing Satan seekes to deface it as he did in old time, if we thinke the Deuill be still like himselfe, as indeed he is no lesse ma∣litious then he hath beene, but hee laboureth more to sow errors and to corrupt men, by how much hee is neerer to his end, why then should wee not looke for his working & practises against the truth to be the same, or worse then they haue beene in times past, let the consideration of this arme vs against offence in regard of the damnable heresies, sects and schismes; which follow the sincere trueth of the Gospell. Let it strengthen vs against discouragement vr∣ged vpon vs by the blasphemous rayling papists, who charge the most heauenly doctrine of the Gospell to bee the seede of all heresies, errors, and tumults: for it is the de∣uill that sowes all the ill seed, and then sets wicked men a∣worke, Papists and such like, to exclaime against the Gos∣pell, as if the fault were in the doctrine of the Gospell.
This is the subtilty and packing of the Deuill, and this beeing discouered vnto vs. Let vs bee strengthened against all discouragement, thar the enemies of the truth are able to enforce by this argument, that errours, op∣positions, and differences doe spring vp where the Gos∣pell is preached, 1. Corinth. 11.19. there must bee here∣sies euen among you, that they which are approoued a∣mong you might be knowne. Come we now to speake of the words following where∣in the Apostle sets downe for whom his labour and figh∣ting was (namely) in particular for the Colossians and for them of Laodicea, and generally for as many as had not seene him, now then, in that the Apostle saith, he had great labor and fighting, a great care to with stand the enemies of the truth by his suffrings, prayers, writings, and reasonings against them, and that for the good of the Colossians, La∣odiceans and others, I might shew that the sufferings of the godly are profitable for others, but of that wee speake, verse 24.1. chap. and againe that the writings of the A∣postles are very profitable for others, daily experience she∣weth. But the point I will stand on is this, that the prayers of the godly are profitable for others, and that in this particu∣lar respect, they are notable meanes of defence to shielde them against the violence of their spirituall enemiesThe prayers of the faithful are profitable for the defect of others a∣gainst the vio∣lence of their speciall ene∣mies. who set vpon their foules to corrupt them with errour, and to bring them into heresie. Touching the efficacy of prayer in generall, that place of Iames is very plaine and pregnant Iames 5.16. that the prayer of the righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent, but for proofe of this, that the prayer of the faithfull is a powerfull meanes to defend others from be∣ing ouercome by the assaults of the enemies of their sal∣uation, reade Ephesians 6.18. wee may there obserue that the Apostle doth reckon prayer as a speciall part of the compleat armour of a Christian, whereby hee may
not onely defend himselfe and repell the assaults of particular enemies, but hee way profitably vse it for the defence of others euen the saints of God and fellow mem∣bers of the same body, pray alwaies for all Saints (saith the Apostle, as if hee had said, doe not vse prayer as an excellent weapon for defence of your selues onely, a∣gainst your spirituall enemies, but for the defence of o∣thers also, euen the Saints of God; if wee looke into the worlde, wee shall finde example of many that haue receaued profit by the praiers of the godly in this kind, they haue beene kept from quite falling from God in time of a daungerous conflict with Satan, and in the Lords good time they haue beene deliuered, but that there bee no mistaking of this point, know that wee are not to ascribe this fruit of prayer to the dignity of pray∣er, or to any worthinesse in the faithfull,Note. but onely to the bottomelesse mercy and goodnesse of the Lord, hee of his infinite goodnes making them so powerfull, and so mighty with himselfe as that they are to him, as it were bands to tye him, and as a wall against him, that he cannot sometimes execute his iudgements on the wicked, vnlesse they (as it were) suffer him, and stand out of his way, and thus wee reade of his mercy to Moses, Exodus 32.10. Let mee alone (saith the Lord) that my wrath may waxe hote against them; is there any thing at all in man to deserue this? no, no surely,  it is the Lords meere mer∣cy to such as it pleaseth him to receiue and imbrace into his loue and mercy. And for the vse of this, it is an exceeding great com∣fort to the children of God, such of them as are weake and happily conflicting with Satan, and vnder some greeuous temptation, and so not able to pray as they ought, or desire, therefore they are to comfort them∣selues in this, that though their praiers bee in much weakenesse, yet they may haue the benefit of the pray∣ers of the godly,Comfort to Gods childrē being weake & conflicting with Satan & vnder some greeuous temptation that they haue the benefit of the prayers of the godly. which are mighty and preuaile muh
with the Lord; but let none at all take hould of this com∣fort but such as are indeede the children of God, and remember with this, that they that will bee prayed for with comfort to their soules, must bee able at one time or other, though happily not for the present, beeing vn∣der some greeuous affliction, yet I say at one time or o∣ther to pray for themselues,Note. though in much weakenes, Deutronomy 33.7. it is saide thus Moses blessed Iudah, and said, heare O Lord the voice of Iudah, hee prayes for Iudah who was able to send vp his voice to God for himselfe, they that neyther are, nor euer were able to pray for themselues, but in time of neede put themselues onely on other mens prayers, they are like the foolish Virgins Matthew 25. who goe to borrow oyle, when they haue most neede to vse it, I deny not but the godly may pray for all sorts of men grounding on Gods gene∣rall commaundement binding them to shew dueties of loue and mercy to all sorts, bee they godly or wicked, an Abraham prayed for the Sodomites, Genesis 18.23. Lot for Zoar Genesis 19.20. but yet onely such as are the children of God haue profite by the prayers of the godly to defend them against the power of spirituall e∣nemies, and to eternall life, the wicked may haue tem∣porall calamities remooued, as Pharaoh had at the pray∣er of Moses and Aaron, and Ieroboam his withered hand restored at the prayer of the Prophet 1. Kings. 23.6. but wicked reprobates cannot haue any spirituall com∣fort by the prayers of the godly, and therefore let this comfort and cheere vp only the children of God in their weakenesse, that though they pray in much weakenesse yet the prayers of the faithfull are strong for them, and they houlding communion with the Saints, they haue part in all the good prayers of the people of GOD, throughout the whole world, and if the Lord heare the prayer of one faithfull man; or of two or three gathered together in his name according to his promise, of what
force then may we thinke are the prayers of thousands, yea ten thousand thousands, euen of all Churches of the cho∣sen children of God throughout the world; How shall not the Lord in mercy according to his promise accomplish that which they aske? surely, the Lord cannot but hear thē calling vpon him, let this then raise vp the hearts of the children of God, and make them in troubles lift vp their heads with comfot, and looke about them, they shall see as Elisha did, moe with them, then against them,2. Kin. 6.16. they haue Angels to guard them, all the Saints on the earth to pray for them, which is a singular cōfort if it be duly considred. One thing more is further to be obserued from the last words of this verse (And for as many as haue not seene my person in the flesh) I will not trouble you with any curious speculation, tending rather to superstition then to edifca∣tion, touching the face of the Apostle, the words are thus to be conceiued, for as many as haue not seene my bodily presence before them, nor euer heard mee speaking vnto them. Now in that the Apostle sayth, he had a great figh∣ting in prayer for as many as had not seene his face; wee are taught. That we must not only striue and be earnest in prayer  for the good of our selues and our familiars and friends, & such as are well knowen vnto vs, but with like earnest care and desire we are to pray for the good of all the members of Iesus Christ, wheresoeuer they bee,We must not only pray for our selues and our famillar friends but for all the mem∣bers of Christ wheresoeuer they be. though neuer seene of vs, wee must neuer pray for our selues or friends with a priuate heart & affection, but we are ro wish and pray for the like mercy to all the members of Christ that haue like neede, it is lawfull for vs to pray for our selues and friends in particular, wee haue the example of Dauid, of Anna, & of our Sauior himselfe, but in prayer for our good, & the good of our friends, we must haue (as they doubtles had) an eie to the cōmon good, that by that thing giuē, be it helth, liberty or the like, we may be better able to serue God, & to do good to our selues & others, & withall
we are inwardly to wish the like good to all the members of Christ, to whom it may stand in like steed, this wee are taught in the first words of that prayer by Christ to his Church, the word (our) being a word of community doth teach vs wee should neuer pray for our selues alone, but together with our selues all others, euen the whole Church of God. The reason  of this is plaine, we are members of one and the same body, and the bond is so strict by which wee are knit together, euen one and the same spirit, that we should feele the griefes of one another, and beare the burdens one of another Heb. 13.3. remember one anothers bonds, sayth the holy Ghost, but how? by speaking or talking of their bonds, by vttering some words of pitty and commi∣seration? no, not onely so, but by remembring them, as though we our selues were bound with them, no doubt if wee were in prison and in bonds wee would besides other meanes vsed, pray for our owne deliuerance, so are wee to remember in our prayers the bonds and imprisonment of others, and euen hartily to pray for them, as wee would for our selues; a duty that we forget too often. We will scarse pray for our neere neighbours that liue daily amongst vs,Reproofe of such as neg∣lect this duty. much lesse doe the miseries of many Saints of God in other places and countries affect vs, nay I feare me, I may iustly speake it, many seldome or neuer pray for their owne families, no childe, no seruant, no o the wife of their own bosome hath the helpe of their pray∣ers, their houses are nurseries and seminaries of cursing and swearing, and all manner of disorder, it is iust with the Lord to punish such with vnruly wiues, with gracelesse children and lewd seruants. Let vs then learne to pray for our selues, and families, if we look for any blessing of God vpon them, and in pray∣ing for our selues, let vs remember the Saints in other pla∣ces, our hearts are commonly narrow and straight, look∣ing onely at our selues, and our owne friends, and the
deare Saints of God, members with vs of the same body are not thought vpon, sincke or swimme the Church of God we care not for it, so we be well, this farre from that affection that ought to be in the members of Christ, and certainely, prayers made without care, and desire of the good of others, returne empty vnto vs without profit or comfort, yea without doubt, it is one cause why the Lord doth not blesse vs in our callings and labours, the people of God say, Psal. 237.5. If I forget Ierusalem, then let my right hand forget to play; the implication of that place is thus much vnto vs, that if we forget the Church of God, and doe not remember the Saints of God in affliction, in that wherein we may doe them most good, as (namely) in our prayers, the Lord may iustly take from vs our cunning and blow vpon our labours, and curse euery thing we take in hand; let this stirre vs vp to thinke of others in Christi∣an loue, as of our selues, and to entreat the Lord fot them as for our selues. VER. 2. That their hearts might be comforted, and they knit together in loue, and in all riches of the full assu∣rance of vnderstanding to know the mystery of God, e∣uen the father, and of Christ. Come we to the second verse which is part of the Apo∣stles exordium or entrance to his matter following; in this verse is first layd downe the end of the Apostles fighting for the good of the Colossians and others, and the end was this, that their hearts might be comforted. Then followes two conditions of such as are capable of that cordiall comfort. First, they are such as are knit together in loue, for so are the words in the originall, that their hearts might be com∣forted, they being knit together in loue. Secondly, such as are knit together in all riches of the full assurance of vnderstanding.
And to this is added by way of opposition an explica∣tion of that vnderstanding, what it is (namely) a know∣ledge of the mystery of God, euen the father, & of Christ: of these things let vs speake in order. That their hearts might be comforted, the word translated (comforted) doth properly signifie encouraged and raised vp by some words of comfort being ready otherwise to faint, or fall downe vnder some affliction or trouble, the Apostles meaning then in these first words is thus much, that their hearts fainting and ready to faile in regard of trouble, and discouragement by false teachers, aduersa∣ries of the truth, might be encouraged and raised vp with comfort. The first thing heere to be marked is, that the Apostle makes it a speciall end of his labouring and striuing for the good of the Colossians and others that their hearts might be comforted, hence we may gather. That one speciall end is to be driuen at in al ministerial actions, in preaching, in praying, in writing and reasoning a¦gainst aduersaries of the truth, is, that mens hearts might be comforted,One speciall end to be ay∣med at in all ministeriall actions is the comfort of mens hearts. that such as belong to Christ may receiue spirituall ioy and comfort of heart,1. Cor. 14.3. the Apostle sayth, hee that prophesieth speaketh vnto men, to edifying and to ex∣hortation and to comfott, or rather (indeed) as the words are, to encouragement and comfort. Two principall ends of preaching are encouragement and comfort; the Gospell is the word of glad tydings and heauenly comfort, and the end of the preaching of it, is to bring Gods Elect to cer∣taine hope of life and saluation, and as many as are begot∣ten to that liuely hope, they are also brought to reioyce with ioy vnspeakeable, 1. Pet. 1.8. in so plaine a poyn it is needelesse to adde further euidence, but for the vse  of it. Consultation of the popish manner of teaching.Is it so, that a speciall end of all ministeriall actions is, that mens hearts might bee comforted. Wickedly then deale popish teachers in turning their teaching to a cleane
contrary end, euen to hold men in suspence, and to make them liue in continuall doubt of their saluation, & so void of all spirituall comfort; euery man may see that is a per∣uerting of the ordinance of God, and a great profanation of the holy word of comfort, which being truly taught & directed to a right end, giues certain light and knowledge of life and saluation, and is powerfull by the worke of the spirit to confer the spirit of adoption, whereby beleeuers know & are assured that they shall be saued, and that doth replenish their harts with exceeding great & vnspeakeable comfort. And againe, for a second vse of this point, it is a  cauill and a reasoning of the flesh, helped forward by the subtilty of Satan, to say, that the diligent attending on the ministry of the word,Resutation of a cauill of the flesh against diligent atten∣ding on the ministry of the word. is a meanes to make men liue an hea∣uy and a dumpish and vncomfortable life, and a meanes to strip and depriue them of all delight, & comfort, yea some are deeply possest with a conceit, that it is a means to make men mad, foolish people somtime haue vttered it, where a Preacher hath been sent among them, that he would make them all go out of their wits, see the cunning of the diuel to fit the humors of men, or rather the drines & barrennes of their harts, being barren of al heauenly comfort, the diuell doth so drench them thorow with carnall delights & plea¦sures, as he keeps them from any taste of the sweetnes of that ioy that might come by profitable hering of the word & he perswades with them that indeed, that is a means to breed in them disquietnes, griefe, sorrow & much vexatiō. We must take heed of this deceit working on our corrup∣tion, & know that a speciall end of preaching, praying & other ministeriall actions, is, that our hearts might be fild with heauenly comfort, yea, such comfort as will season all other outward comforts, and make them truly comfor∣table, yea, such comfort as will turne our affliction to tri∣umph, and such comfort as once begun shall neuer be ta∣ken from vs, but shall continue with vs for euer,Rom. 8.57. let vs then banish & cast out of our minds,Ioh. 16.22. all such deceiuing thoghts
that the ministry of the Word, Sacraments, prayer an¦ther holy exercises are meanes to strip vs of all comfo they are meanes (indeed) to humble vs and to wound vs for our sinnes, but yet to binde vs vp againe with heauly comfort, to worke in vs peace of conscience, to settle vs in assurance of our right to eternall life, and to giue vs a tst and beginning of that ioy eye hath not seene, eare hath o heard, nor the heart of man conceiued. One thing more obserue wee from these words, the words (as I shewed) are thus to be conceiued, that their hearts labouring and ready to faint, might be encouraged and raised vp with comfort. See then the necessity of encouragement against ad∣saries of the truth,Encourage∣ment against aduersaries of the truth is necessary. if true Christians be not encouraged by such as are to fight for them as Generals and Captaines, I meane the Ministers of the Gospell, they faint and are ready to fall vnder the hands of such as seeke to make a prey of them, Gal. 5.12. I would to God they were euen cut off, which doe disquiet you. The originall word signi∣fieth to put men out of their estate, and to driue them out house and home, as enemies doe in time of warre, and it giues vs to vnderstand, that if the enemies of the truth be suffered to haue their wils, and the people of God bee not encouraged and strengthened by comfortable exhortati∣ons, prayers, and other meanes against them, they will in the end sacke and spoile them of their comfort. We therefore are to be instant and earnest with the Lord in prayer, that such as are to fight for vs, and to stand for the maintenance of the truth, may be knit together as one man, and may ioyne their forces against the common ad∣uersaries of the truth,We must pray earnestly that they who stand for the maintenance of the truth may ioyne to∣gether against the common aduersaries of the truth. the Papists, for surely, they beginne to gather ground and to encroach vpon vs, wee therefore are to pray vnto the Lord, (that is all wee can doo) thar the differences amongst the Ministers of the Gospell being but in circumstance, not in substance as popish inchanters buzze in the heads of the simple, that these differences may
be compounded, and that they may ioyne hearts, hands and all their force against the aduersaries of our comfort, & may be better able to minister vnto vs encouragement, strength and continuall supply of heauenly comfort. Come we now to the first condition of such as are capa∣ble of comfort of heart, in the next words,1. Cond. (that their harts may be comforted, they being knit together in loue) the word heere rendered (knit together) doth signifie such a coniunction and knitting together as is of the parts and members of the same body,Interpreta∣tion. which are conioyned and knit together by ligaments, by nerues and sinewes, and so the word is vsed by the Apostle Ephes. 4.16. by whom all the body being coupled and knit together by euery ioynt for the furniture thereof. Thus then these words are to bee conceiued, they being coupled and knit together thorow the bound of loue as the members of the naturall body are by nerues and sinewes. We are heere to marke that the A∣postle makes it a speciall condition of such as were capable of the comfort: he driueth at in all his painfull labours and suffrings, that they were such as were knit together in loue, hence we may gather. That ioyning together in loue with our Christian bre∣thren  it makes way and entrance for inward comfort offe∣red, and afforded from the outward meanes of comfort, such as hold fellowship and communion with their bre∣thren in Christian loue are most capable, and most fit to receiue heauenly comfort, by the holy ordinances and by the exercises of religion,They that hold commu∣nion with their brethren in Christian loue are most fit to receiue heauenly cō∣fort by the holy ordinan∣ces of God. preaching prayer, and the like meanes of spirituall comfort, for why? that ioyning toge∣ther in loue is a forcible meanes to procure, and to bring downe a blessing from heauen vpon Gods ordinances ap∣pointed for the comfort of his chosen, to make them com∣fortable to vs in particular, we read Psal. 133. where bre∣thren ioyne together in loue, and dwell together in vnity, it is not onely a good and comely thing, but such a thing as hath promise of a blessing annexed vnto it, it is a means
to procure a blessing vpon our hearing of the word of comfort, to make that effectual for our cōfort 2. Cor. 8.1.2. the Apostle doth auouch that his ministry wrought as great grace and as great comfort in the Macedonian chur∣ches, as in any other whatsoeuer, and withall he giues te∣stimony of them, that they were such as were knit toge∣ther in loue, and made their loue knowen by their ready contribution to the releefe of the poore Saints; ioyning in loue together, is a meanes to bring downe a blessing on our prayers to the comfort of our soules. Psal. 86.2. Dauid had encouragement to call vpon God with assurance of comfort to the preseruation, of his life, when hee could truely plead that hee ioyned with the Saints in loue, and that he did manifest his loue towards them by workes of mercy, Preserue thou my soule for I am mercifull, I might thu goe on to other particulars, but these may suffice to s that ioyning together in loue, is a meanes to bring down a blessing vpon the ordinances of God, and to make the effectuall to our comfort, and so it makes way for inward cōfort offred vnto vs from the outward means of comfort, yea it makes way for comfort offred vnto vs, when we haue most need of comfort, in our feares, temptations and affli∣ctions, either of body or minde, if we be such as are linked to our brethren in loue, it inuiteth the godly to repaire vn∣to vs in our troubles, it makes them desirous to refresh our hearts with words of comfort, it strengthens their hope in their supplications & praiers to God for vs, yea it miniers arguments of comfort to our own souls, thogh other m should not come at vs, or deale so well with vs, as to mini∣ster comfort vnto vs, by counsell, prayers, and other mean yet our owne consciences telling vs that we are such as are knit to our brethrens loue that testimony of our own hart with the testimony of the spirit of God, will support our souls in the greatest extremity. 1. Ioh. 3.14. We know we are translated frō death vnto life because we loue the brethren &c. what then shall daunt or dismay vs? It was Iobs case when
his friends were Physitians of no value, Iob. 13.4. not a∣ble to apply the word of comfort aright, and miserable cōforters, then did Iob amongst other arguments of cōfort to himselfe, recount and call to mind this, that he had held communion of loue, with the poorest Saints of God, and testified his loue by fruits of mercy, as wee may read Iob. 31. from verse 16, to 23. How then shall not this affect our soules, and stir vp our  hearts to ioyne together in Christian loue,A forcible motiue to stir vs vp to ioyne together in Christian loue and to labour to be knit fast one to another by the bond of true loue, seeing ioyning one with another in loue, is a meanes to giue way to true comfort of heart offered from the outward meanes of comfort, yea, to procure a blessing vpon the ordinances of God appointed for the comfort of his chosen, yea, such a thing as will yeeld matter of comfort, when friends who should comfort vs doe faile, and forsake vs,2. Phil. 1.2. who then will not be mooued to ioyne with his brethren in loue, yea, let me conclude with the Apostle. If there bee therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of loue, any comfort yeelded from loue, then fulfill my ioy, (it would indeed be a great ioy to all that feare God) to see it, that ye be like minded hauing the same loue. Again, that ioyning together in loue is a means to make  way and entrance for inward comfort offered from the outward meanes of comfort, yea, procuring a blessing on the meanes of comfort, what then may wee thinke of distraction, and of drawing our harts a sunder one from another, through enuy, hatred, rank or and malice, surely, that must needs bring foorth the contrary effects,Distraction & drawing our hearts a sun∣der one from another brings foorth a fearefull effect. euen set a barre betweene vs and inward comfort, and make vs vn∣fit to receiue it, yea, bring downe iudgement in steede of mercy, and a curse in steed of that comfort that might come vnto vs by the ordinances of God, appoynted for the comfort of his chosen. Such persons as haue their harts full of swelling, heart-burning, and deadly hatred against their brethren, and such as haue their mouths filled with
galling, bitter & venemous speeches, or do any way break the bond of loue, & so continue, can they looke that the Lord should giue them any grace, or comfort by his word or other holy ordinances? no certainly, the Apostle hath taught vs that such persons haue foule and defiled hands, 1. Tim. 2.8. I will that men pray, euery where lifting vp pure hands without wrath. If there be wrath and conten∣tion in the heart, the hands are soiled, and made vnfit to compasse Gods altar, & the Lord doth challenge men for comming into his house with bloudy hands, Isaiah. 1.15. yea he saith, if we stretch out such hands, he will hide his eyes from vs, and though we make many prayers he will not heare vs, We are now shortly to be made partakers of the Sacrament of the Lords supper, thereby to seale vp our vnion with Christ, and our faith in his bloud, and to testifie our communion with the members of Christ, let vs know we can looke for no comfort by receiuing that sacrament which is full of comfort to a worthy receiuer, vnlesse we be knit together in true Christian loue one to another, if wee come to be knit more neerely to Christ, and bee deuided one from another, wee deceiue our selues, wee shall but seale vppe iudgement to our selues, and eate and drinke our owne damnation. Now I know the Diuell will be rea∣dy to catch aduantage vpon this speech of mine, and will put it into the heads of such as bee at oddes, and iarre with others, that therefore it is good for them to forbeare com∣ming to the Sacrament because they cannot receiue it with comfort, they cannot come with quiet mindes; see the cunning of the old Serpent, how he can put on the person of the teacher, and take on him to teach men what is good for them, to auoyd the danger of damnation (if wee may beleeue him) indeed it is not good for men to come to the table of the Lord in the dregs of their malice and hatred, but why are they not (as they ought) with speed reconci∣led both to God and men: will they continue and go on in their malice and vnchristian iars, and make that a suffici∣ent
place and reason of waight to keepe them from the ta∣ble of the Lord, who taught them to suffer the sunne to go downe on their wrath, and so take the Diuell to bed with them? yea, to lodge in the closet of their hearts, and then to plead that as an excuse to keepe them from the Lords table? this is euen to adde drunkennesse to thirst, one sinne to another, or when we haue wounded our selues by sin to go on to the Diuell for a medicine; I would demand of such persons but this one thing, let them answer if they can, they say they cannot come to the Sacrament with hope of any comfort, let that be granted, it is true, so long as they continue in their malice▪ let them tell me then, if the Lord should now in this state wherein they are, lay his heauy hand vpon them, (as they are in continuall perill of stroakes and iudgements to light on them, being at enmity with the brethren they abide in death, what then can be sayd vnto them for their comfort,1. Ioh. 3.14. if good and godly men come vnto them of purpose to speak to their comfort, what can they say to mitigate their feares, or to lessen their tor∣ment of soule and conscience, surely nothing, till they haue giuen some euident token of their repentance and of tho∣row reconciliation with their brethren, & then they may iustly doubt of the truth of their repentance, and that it is but forced and not of sincerity; yea, their owne harts may iustly doubt of it, and be most forward and forcible to ac∣cuse and to condemne them, and if our hearts condemne vs, God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things 1. Ioh. 3.10. he also will condemne vs. Let this then be thought on, and let it stir vp such as be at difference and iarre with their brethren to seeke for spee∣dy reconciliation, and let them not make their quarrell & contention, a pretence to keep them from the Lords table, for that is to adde sin to sin, but this day before to morrow let them labour to be reconciled to their brethren, least the punishing hand of God ouertake them, and then they bee left, not only voyd of comfort, but vncapable of any com∣fort,
and in such a case as the best men in the world shall not be able to minister sound comfort vnto them. We are further to marke, that the Apostle sayth not, be∣ing such as loue one another, but being knit together in loue, he sets out their vnion thorow loue by a similitude from the coniunction of the members of a naturall body. Hence we are taught that true beleeuers are as neerely coupled and compacted together one to another thorow loue, as the members of one bodyTrue belee∣uers are as neerely cou∣pled together thorow loue as the mem∣bers of one body. Act. 4.32. are by nerues and si∣news, it is an vsuall and known comparison of Scripture to compare true beleeuers to the members of one body, true beleeuers of the primitiue times, thogh they were a multi∣tude, yet they are sayd to be of one heart & of one soule and therefore (no doubt) they were as one body; and this may serue as a ground of triall,  heerby we may try our loue one towards another, whether it be true Christian loue, or counterfeitTriall of our loue one to∣ward another whether it be true or coun∣terfet. and carnall loue; if wee be so knit together in loue grounded on the image of God, as it were as easie to pull an arme, or a leg from the body of a man, as vs one from another, then is our loue true Christian loue, and if by this rule we examine our loue, we shall finde that many of vs are much defectiue in this duty, can we perswade our selues wee are knit together in loue, as the members of one body, and yet vpon a matter of a trifling profit, yea, vpon suspition of some wordly losse grow discontented start a sunder, and breake the bond of loue, yea, breake out into opprobrious termes and vile slanders, is this to be compacted and knit together, as the members of one body? if we so thinke wee deceiue our selues, this is that the wise man speakes of Prou. 26.23. siluer, drosse ouer∣layed vpon a potsheard, so are burning lips and an euill heart; euen to haue burning lips, lips as it were inflamed with the fire of loue, professing great measure of loue, but an heart cold, wicked and mischeeuous, and that we may be stirred vp to a reformation of our selues, consider wee onely this one thing.
We can neuer be assured of our vnion with Christ Iesus til we finde our selues knit together in loue one to another; for though that be first in nature, yet this is first knowne, & we can neuer know that by this. If any say he loues God (i) that he is assured of Gods loue to him, and yet bee not in loue with his brother, he deceiues himselfe, hee is no better then a lier. If then we would not be found liers for the good of our owne soules, and proue our selues stil in the dregs of nature, hauing no fellowship with Christ Iesus the foun∣taine of all our comfort. Let vs neuer rest till we be knit together in loue, groun∣ded on the image of God, and so fast as nothing in the world whatsoeuer fals out be able to pull vs asunder. Now to the second condition of such as are capable of inward comfort in the next words.2. Cond. And knit together in all riches of the full assurance of vnderstanding. By these words, in all riches of the full assurance of vn∣derstanding,Interpreta∣tion. &c. wee are to vnderstand the Faith of the Gospell, as may appeare by the words following, where the Apostle doth explane himselfe, that this full assurance of vnderstanding, is a knowledge of the mystery of God, e∣uen the Father of Christ, and in him a gracious Father vnto vs, now this Faith is heere described and set out, by the ge∣neral nature of it, that it is an vnderstanding, or knowledge and that further amplified by the quality of it, that it is a certain, or an assured knowledge, a full perswasion of vn∣derstanding, so the word signifieth, and again by the mea∣sure of that certainty in these words in all riches, which is a borrowed phrase to signifie plenty, and a great measure. Thus then are these words briefly to be conceiued. In the faith of the Gospell, which is a most plentifull and infallible certainty of vnderstanding. Heere first wee are to marke that the Apostle was not content to say, they beeing knit together in loue, but hee addes further, and knit together in the true Faith of Iesus Christ, (for that is the generall heere set downe in other
termes) hence ariseth this conclusion. That a coniunction and ioyning together in loue, n in one and the same true faith, they must euer goe toge∣ther,Ioyning toge∣ther in loue & in one and the same true faith must goe together as we must be knit together in loue, so wee must b conioyned in one and the same true faith: these two ma not bee diuorced, nor put a sunder one from the th, for as the Apostle teacheth, without one fayth, th cannot bee one body wee may obserue it, Ephes. 4. wh hee hath spoken of one body, verse 4. hee subioy verse 5. one faith giuing vs to vnderstand, that there ca¦not bee one body, without one faith, no, though it be of such as are knit together most neerely by some t¦ward bond, for example by the bond of marriage,  husband and wife are not one body, vnder the same head Christ Iesus, vnlesse they bee knit together in the  true faith of Iesus Christ, they are indeede one flesh by the bond of marriage, as they haue relation one to ano∣ther, but in relation to Christ the head of all true b¦uers, they are not knit together in one body, if they  disioyned in faith,  and ought to bee thought on by s as are to enter into that neere vnion of marriage,A duty of such as enter into that neere v∣nion of mar∣riage. to them it may most fitly bee applyed, they are to looke that they ioyne together, not onely in mutuall loue one to another but in one and the same fayth of Iesus Christ, and against this doe they offend, who ioyne in that neere bond of marriage with such as bee not of the same faith, and the same religion, it is good for vs to bee aduised in matching our children or our selues in marriage, and that wee espe∣cially looke at the trueth of faith, and the soundnesse of religion. Note.Let vs knowe that it is a secret poyson that destroyes vertue more then any thing, when the godly are vn¦ly yoaked with the vngodly; Let vs not stand vppon our wisedome in this poynt, that wee are wise, and able to a∣uoyde the danger, remember that Solomon was full of wisedome, and beloued of God, yet for all his wisedome,
hee was ouerthrowen by matching with the daughters of the wicked, it is sayd of Iehoram, that hee forsooke the way of the Lord, and wrought all wickednesse in full measure, and why? because sayth the text, the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and let this warne all, whom it may concerne, that in matching our selues, or our children in marriage, we looke cheifely to the truth and soundnesse of religion. The next thing offered from these words, if wee looke on them as a description of faith is, that true faith for the  generall nature of it, is an vnderstanding, or knowledge,True faith in the generall nature of it is a knowledge of things to be beleeued. and euidence and light of spirituall knowledge is the ge∣nerall nature of true faith, the speciall forme and proper acte of it, is an apprehension, and a particular applicati∣on of the sauing promise knowen, and of Christ promi∣sed, the substance of the couenant of grace, but the gene∣rall nature of it, it is a knowledge of things to bee belee∣ued, hence it is that the Lord sayth by his Prophet, Isay. 53.11. by his knowledge shall my righteous seruant iu∣stifie many &c. and our Sauiour Ioh. 17.3. this is life e∣ternall, that they know thee to bee the onely very God, and whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ, the Apostle 1. Pet. 3.15. teacheth vs to bee ready alwaies to giue an account, to make an apologie, and to stand in defence of our hope, which cannot bee without knowledge, Augustine proo∣ueth by the text of the Apostle, Rom. 10.14. where it is sayd, faith comes by hearing &c. that faith is ioyned with knowledge, for how can a man beleeue by hearing that he vnderstand, not, it is then a cleere point, that faith for the generall nature of it, is a light of vnderstanding, it will bee sayd, and indeede it is the obiection of the Papists,Ob. who hold faith to bee no knowledge, but a bare assent of minde without vnderstanding of that, wherunto the mind assenteth, that the Apostle 1. Cor. 13.2. makes a plaine distinction betweene knowledge and faith, and doth seuer them as being two sundry things, if I knew all secrets & all
knowledge, yea if I had all faith &c. therefore (say they) faith is not a knowledge.  This a silly and slender reason, if it be well considered, look vpon the text & consider it, is this a good reason to say, the Apostle doth reckon vp know∣ledge and faith seuerally, therefore knowledge and faith haue no fellowship or agreement one with another, then this also is a good reason, the gift of prophesie and know∣ledge is reckned vp seuerally, therfore prophesie & know∣ledge cannot meet together in one man, hee that hath the gift of prophesie, hath no knowledge; how absurd is this, euery man may see, & the other must needs be as grosse, it remaines then a truth notwithstanding this cauill of th Papists, that faith is a light of vnderstanding, & necessarily brings with it an illumination of the mind, let no man then deceiue himselfe,  let no man thinke hee hath true faith when he hath no knowledge or vnderstanding of things to bee beleeued,We may not think that we haue true faih wanting knowledge of things to bee beleeued. and is not able to render any reasonable account of his faith, what he doth hold and beleeue need∣full to saluation, he that so thinkes deceiues himselfe, and let it bee thought on by such as come to the Table of the Lord, heerein stands one part of their examination they are to examine their knowledge in the doctrine of the Sacraments touching the Sacramentall relation of the signes with the things signified, I say not, if men haue illu∣mination and knowledge, then they haue faith, for illumi∣nation is a common gift, and though it be from the spirit, yet is it not of the spirit;Note. but this I dare bee bold to say, If there bee no knowledge, then there is no faith: it is the first action of the Spirit of God, in the renouation of the image of God in his Elect, to renewe them in the Spirit of their mindes, Ephes. 4.23. If there bee darknesse in the minde, certainly, there is nothing but sin in all other faculties of the soule. Our Sauiour sayth, Mat. 6.23. If the eye be darke, then all thy body shall bee darke, it is a true saying that one hath, that an ignorant heart is al∣way a sinnefull heart, and a man without knowledge
is a man without grace, let this bee thought on, and let it stirre vs vp to follow the counsell of the wiseman, Pro. 2.3, to call for wisedome, and to cry to heauen by prayer for vnderstanding, and by vse of all good meanes hearing, rea∣ding, meditating in the word of God, and to seeke for it, yea to digge for it, as for gold and pretious stones, and a little to helpe forward our desire & endeauour after know∣ledge, remember the words of the Apostle, 2. Thes. 1.7.8. that the Lord Iesus at the day of iudgement shall shew himselfe from heauen with his mighty Angells, in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them that do not know God and which obey not vnto the Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ, these two following close one vpon another, igno∣rance of God, and want of obedience vnto the Gospell of Christ, and this ignorance is so foule a sinne as it shall bee sufficient to bring downe vengeance on them in whome it shall bee found at the comming of Christ to iudge∣ment. Come we from the generall nature of Faith, to the qua∣lity  of it, as it is an vnderstanding,True faith is a distinct cer∣taine and in∣fallible know∣ledge. that it is a full assurance and infallible certainty of knowledge, and that a rich or plentifull knowledge, much might bee spoken on these wordes, but that I will briefly note from th shall bee this. That true Faith is not a confused notion wrapped vp al∣together in vncertainty, so as a man cannot bee sure what he holds, or beleeues, but it is a distinct, a certaine and an infallible knowledge, which makes a demonstration in the mind of the beleeuer grounded not on reason, or sence, but vpon diuine testimony, and vpon the worde of God. Hence Hebrewes 11.1. it is saide to bee the euidence of things which are not seene, (that is) the infallible demon∣stration and certainty, whereby the mind being continued by diuine testimony, doth most firmely embrace the pro∣mises of God touching remission of sinnes, and iustifica∣tion by Christ, the Scripture is most plentiful in the proofe of this.
That true Faith is a distinct, a certaine, and infallle knowledge,Popish impli∣cite fayth no true faith. where then is any place for implicite Faith taught by the Papists, who say it is sufficient for a Christi∣an to beleeue as the Church beleeues, though hee neuer know distinctly and certainly what the Church beleeues, this is indeed no true Faith, but a blockish ignorance, and this doctrine tends to hold men in blindnesse superstition and perpetuall ignorance, we are to renounce it, and to remember that true Faith is a distinct certaine and infalli∣ble knowledge, yet that this doctrine be not a snare to in∣tangle and perplexe the consciences of the weake, remem∣ber further, that though true faith bee a distinct, certaine, and infallible knowledge, yet it is not a perfect knowledge Father Latimer said well, there is great difference between certaine knowledge, and cleere or perfect knowledge, cer∣taine knowledge may be of things absent that appeare not, but cleare or perfect knowledge requireth the presence of the obiect, it is said we see now darkely as through a glass. A man may therefore distinctly and certainely know that which he beleeues, though not clearely and perfectly, and this may comfort such as haue but a little portion of sa∣uing knowledge, if it be certaine, though weake, it is plea∣sing to Go and comfortable to themselues, if so bee they content not themselues with it, but labour to encrease it, and to grow from one measure to another, for so wil euery one that hath any beginning of sauing knowledge, he that thinks he hath a portion of sauing knowledge, & contents himselfe with it, and neuer labors to increase it, & to come to a rich assurance of knowledge, hath indeede no true knowledge at all. Now to the last words of this verse, which are as I shew∣ed, added by way of opposition, as an explication of that word (vnderstanding) what it is (namely) knowledge of the mystery of God, to which is subioyned how God is reuealed in that mystery (namely) in distinction of per∣sons (euen the Father of Christ, and Christ the soone of the Father.
To know the mystery of God, euen the Father, and of Christ.] By the word mystery hauing this addition,Interpreta∣tion. the Mystery of God, and God distinguished into the Father and Son, We are to vnderstand the Gospell which is the doctrine of the humiliation, exaltation, humanity, diuinity, office of meditation, and all things concerning the life & death of Christ, and this doctrine is called a mystery, as heereto∣fore I haue shewed, because the things deliuered in the Gospell are wonderfull, deepe, and secret, hid from the eye of naturall reason, and made knowne onely by diuine reuelation, and in this mystery of the Gospell is God re∣uealed to bee the Father of Christ, and Christ to bee the Sonne of God the Father, thus then are these words to be conceaued as if the Apostle had said. To know the deepe secret, and hidden mystery of the Gospell, manifesting and reuealing vnto vs God, as hee is the Father of Christ, and Christ the sonne of the Father, and God equall to his Father. Now wee are to marke that Faith beeing (as ye haue heard) for the generall nature a knowledge, it is heere fur∣ther set out together with the obiect of that knowledge, together with that thing whereof it is a knowledge, that it is a knowledge of the mystery of God (that is) of the Gos∣pell reuealing God the Father, and the mediator Christ Ie∣sus. Hence ariseth this point of doctrine that the proper obiect of the knowledge of Faith is the doctrine of the  Gospell, true Faith that brings comfort is a knowledge of God reuealed in the mystery of the Gospell.True sauing faith is a knowledge of God reuea∣led in the my∣stery of the Gospell. It is not a knowledge of God reuealed in the booke of the creatures, spoken of, Rom. 1.20. nor a knowledge of God reuealed in the morall Law of God, where God re∣quireth absolute, complete, perfect, and personall righte∣ousnesse, which if any could reach vnto, he should be fully acceptable to God, and needed not to flye to Christ to bee his redeemer, but comfortable and sauing Faith is a know∣ledge of God as hee is made knowne in the couenant of
grace, in the Gospell, euen a light and knowledge of the glorious maiesty of the mystery of God in the face of Ie∣sus Christ as saith the Apostle 2. Cor. 4.6. and hence it  that the Apostle Rom. 10.3. saith, though the Iewes knew the righteousnesse which is of the Law and went about to stablish it, yet they were ignorant, and had no knowledge of true righteousnesse, the righteousnesse of God and the righteousnesse of Faith, and in the same chapter, verse  hee calls the word of the Gospell, the word of Faith, ¦ing that word which sauing Faith doth properly eye  hath respect vnto, for indeed the drift and scope of all the oracles of God, and of the whole Scriptures, is, and  was, to lead Gods elect to the knowledge of the sing promise, and of Christ promised the substance of the Go¦pell; and howsoeuer Moses gaue a Law which by ron of our corruption is the minister of death, yet wrote he al∣so of Christ, Iohn 5.46. and did foreshew the death and passion of Christ for sinne, in many types and figures  the Brasen serpent and in the sacrifices of the ceremoniall law, yea the drift of the morall Law it selfe, was to bring to Christ, Galath. 3.34. it beeing the ende and scope of the whole Scripture to lead the chosen of God to the know∣ledge of the sauing promise vnto faith, for sauing faith hath respect vnto the sauing promise it must need, be that faith is a knowledge of God reuealed in the mystery of the gos∣pell. Let no man then fancy to himselfe that hee hath at∣ned true Faith,Reproofe of them that rest in a confused and supersti∣tious know∣ledge of God. when hee hath onely a superficiall and con∣fused knowledge of God, such knowledge of God as may bee had by the light of nature, or such as may be gathered by the sight of the creatures, is there any such among Christians will some say? I answere, vndoubtedly this ex∣hortation is not vnseasonable in respect of many that pro∣fesse christianity, many there bee who hauing liued in the bosome of the Church, and in the cleare light of the gos∣pell, ten, twenty, thirty, yea forty or fifty yeares, and yet (to
their shame may it be spoken) haue no more true & sauing knowledge of God, as God hath reuealed himselfe in the Gospel then the very heathen, who neuer heard of Christ, & that I may not seem to accuse, but to proue that I speak, do not most men and women imagin they know God, as he is reuealed in the Gospell, when they conceiue him to be a God all of mercy, & that the Gospell makes knowne no∣thing but his mercy, grace & goodnes in Christ Iesus. I ap∣peale to the harts of many, whether they do not thus Now what is this, but to misconceiue of God, & to set vp an idol in their owne brain, for in the Gospel God is made known vnto vs to be perfectly iust, and perfectly mercifull, yea which is a deep mystery,Note. that the iustice and mercy of God are reconciled, and that both his perfect iustice, and his perfect mercy, are met together & expressed towards his chosen in Christ, if we thus know not God, we doe not know him as he hath reuealed himselfe in the Gospell, and yet many hauing not this knowledge fancy to themselues they haue faith, & do not sticke to say, though they want knowledge they haue a good minde, marke how the holy ghost hath met with this fancy, without knowledge the mind is not good,Pro. 19.2. it is not possible the minde should be good without know∣ledge. Thus haue I shewed, without knowledge of the sa¦uing promise of God reuealed in the Gospel, it is not possi∣ble that any should haue faith. Let no man then deceiue himself & think he hath faith, & yet know not God in the face of Iesus Christ, let vs all labour by the vse of all good meanes, crauing assistance of the spirit of God, who onely reuealeth the deep things of God,1. Cor. 2.10. that wee may come to the knowledge of God manifested in the Gospell, and consider wee this one thing, that the want of true faith is the cause of all iudgements, it brings plagues of all kindes vpon our soules bodies, goods, and good names, yea it is the cause of those iudgments, we many times foo∣lishly ascribe to wiches & wizards, when Gods hand is vpō vs in some strange manner, wee ascribe it to witches, and
wizards, but indeede it is a wicked heart of vnbeleefe that hath brought that iudgement vpon vs, that is the witch we may obserue in Iude epist. 5. vers. that the people that were deliuered out of Aegypt, were afterward destroyed, but why? for their murmuring, their fornication, their temp∣ting of God, their reuiling of Moses? no, though these sins were common amongst them, yet saith the text, they were destroyed for their vnbeleefe; therefore let vs neuer rest till we haue a measure of sauing knowledge of God as hee hath reuealed himselfe in the Gospell; what the word my∣stery doth affoord, I will not stand vpon, hauing before spoken of the poynt; the next thing wee are to marke, is, that the Apostle saith to know God, and hee stayes not there, but saith further, God the Father, and in Christ his Sonne. Hence I gather, that there is no true vnderstanding of God, but as he is knowne distinct in persons, it is not suf∣ficient to know that hee is one in essence; but wee are to know him distinguished in three persons,It is not e∣nough to know that God is one in essence but we must also know him distinguished in three per∣sons. the Father, Son, and holy ghost, all eternall and equall in power, glory and maiesty, onely one true and euerliuing God, I say distin∣guished in persons, for wee must not conceiue the persons in the Trinity, as diuided and seuered one from another, s three men are really diuided one from another, though all of one kind, for the diuine essence is infinite, and ad∣mits no diuision, but the whole essence of the godhead is in euery person. These things are hard to be conceiued, and wee must looke on them with a spirituall eye, with, the eye of Faith, and pray that our eyes may bee opened, and annoynted with the eye salue of the spirit, for the right conceiuing of the Vnity of the diuine essence, and the trinity of persons,We must look vpon the vni∣ty of the di∣uine essence of the trinity of persons with a spiritu∣all eye of faith and that will keepe vs from many dangerous errours, but to hold to the words of the Apostle in this place, know thus much, that God is the Father of Christ in respect of his deity by nature, because hee is of the same eternall es∣sence
with the Father, and of his humanity by personall v∣nion, because his humanity is assumed, and doth subsist in his deity, Iohn 1.14. the worde was made flesh. Thus is Christ the sonne of God. There remaines a doubt to bee remoued, occasioned from these words. Some may say,  is true faith a knowledge of Christ to bee the Sonne of God, the Deuills haue this, and so they confessed, Marke 5.7. I answere, it is true,  the Deuills haue this knowledge of Christ that hee is the sonne of God; Now that is but the generall nature of Faith, there is in iustifying Faith, not onely this knowledge that Christ is the sonne of God, and the annointed Messiah, to take away the sinnes of the world, but a particular acknowledgement of it that Christ is so to vs, and so much is signified in the words of the Apostle, and thus we are to conceiue of Peters confession, Matthew 16.16. though the Papists alledge it to the con∣trary; our Sauioars answere in the next verse, flesh and bloud hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen, puts it out of all question, that Peters confes∣sion was more then a generall knowledge, and confession, that may be in Deuills, vnlesse wee say the Deuills made the same by the holy ghost, which were most absurd and blasphemous, there is then in faith for the generall na∣ture of it, a knowledge that Christ is the Sonne of God, and there is a particular acknowledgement and applica∣tion of it with comfort, and this we are to labour for. VER. 3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge. In this verse for the matter of it, is laid downe the first generall proposition that is handled in this chapter, name∣ly that proposition which the Apostle doth labour to
strengthen and perswade the Colosians, to imbrace and to hold fast, and it is this. The first ge∣nerall propo∣sition handled in this chap∣ter.That in Christ full and perfect knowledge of all things needfull to saluation is to be found. Now this proposition is not plainly in these termes de∣liuered, but it lies vnder a similitude, wherein Christ is like∣ned to a treasury, or an house of store, and this knowledge to a treasure, and the Apostle saith in him are laide vp fast and close all the treasures of this knowledge. For the better clearing of the text let vs enter into a more speciall examination of the words. Interpreta∣tion.(In whome) the originall worde may bee rendred (in whom or in which) for they may be referred either to the word (mystery) or to Christ, all is one in the sence & mea∣ning of the Apostle, for the matter and substance of the Gospell is Christ, and wee are to acknowledge no other Christ but hee that is set before vs in the Gospell, but the most receaued translation is (in whom) with relation to Christ, (all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, (i) the most excellent and precious things of wisedome and knowlege, & we are to vnderstand by the word (wisedom) the knowledge of things to be knowne and beleeued; and by the worde knowledge the knowledge of things to bee practised (are hid) (i) are not knowne in respect of natu∣rall men and naturall reason. Thus then conceiue the words of the Apostle, as if he had said, in which Christ ar the most excellent and pretious things needfull: To bee knowne either concerning faith, or good life to bee found, though hid from naturall men, and naturall reason. Now first of all, the matter and substance of this verse, that in Christ all things needfull to bee knowne to saluati∣on are to be found beeing considered together with the similitude vnder which it is deliuered, doth affoord this conclusion. That Christ is the store-house of all sauing and comfor∣table knowledge, in him is all sauing knowledge laid vp, as
in an house of store,Christ is the storehouse of all sauing and comfortable knowledge and from him onely it must bee deri∣ued, from him onely must we fetch all sauing knowledge, for why? in Christ is treasured vp the knowledge of the di∣uine essence and nature, he being very God, 1. Iohn 5.20. the knowledge of the maiesty and power of God manife∣sted by his miracles, and resurrection, the knowledge of the iustice, goodnes, loue and mercy of God made known by his comming into the world, and suffering of death, 1. Tim. 1.15. Christ Iesus came into the worlde to saue sin∣ners, the knowledge of the work of creation,Colos. 1.16. gouernment and preseruation of the world, Heb. 1.3. he doth sustaine or beare vp all things by his mighty word, &c. In a word, the knowledge of the reconciliation, redemption, and saluati∣on of Gods chosen, and of eternall life and glory reserued in heauen for them, all these are poynts of sauing know∣ledge to which all others may be reduced, and these are all to be found in Christ, and onely in him with comfort, he is the volume in which all these, and all other poynts of sa∣uing knowledge are written, reuealed & made knowne to vs. Hence then of necessity it followeth, that the know∣ledge  of any thing out of Christ is not a comfortable knowledge,The know∣ledge of any thing out of Christ is not a comfortable knowledge. a knowledge tending to saluation, but rather to destruction and damnation for example (houlding our selues to the Apostles similitude) a knowledge of any me∣rit, any satisfaction to God, and of any treasure of the Church out of Christ. The Papists would beare vs in hand that they know a treasure belonging to the infinit treasure of the satisfaction purchased by the passion of Christ out of Christ, and what is that? forsooth the passions of the blessed Virgine Mary, and of all other Saints, who suffe∣red more as they blasphemously speake) then their sinnes required, this is no sauing and comfortable knowledge, but an accursed and damnable knowledge, indeede a fancy and dreame of their owne, it is at iarre and dis∣cord within it selfe, for how can that which is infinite admitte any thing to be adioyned and added vnto it, they
acknowledge an infinite treasure of satisfaction in Christ, and yet they say there belongs to it other satisfac∣tions, what is this but with one & the same breath to con∣tradict themselues? I leaue them therefore to vanish in their gaine sayings, & come to our selues vpon this ground. That all sauing knowledge is to be deriued from Christ consider wee thus much,There is no comfort in the know∣ledge of God out of Christ, & much lesse in the know∣ledge of any other thing. that for vs to know any thing out of Christ, though the thing it selfe be good, yea euen goodnesse it selfe, yea God himselfe, yet there is no com∣fort in such knowledge out of Christ, wee know him but as an angry iudge, and as a God clothed with iustice and iudgement against vs, yea to descend lower to things fa∣miliar, and of daily vse with vs, to know things giuen vn∣to vs of God, either spirituall or temporall, either con∣cerning the good of our soules as the worde and Sacra∣ments, &c. or the good of our bodies, as meate, drinke, apparell, house or land, &c. to know these things to bee blessings of God, is not sufficient, that is no comfortable knowledge, yet many rest in that knowledge, & think it ∣nough if they can say, God hath blessed them with such  such things, the heathens were able to say so, there i  comfort in such knowledge, our knowledge of things  vs of God must goe a step further, it must be groundd  Christ that it may be comfortable: we must labor to know good things giuen vs, not onely to be blessings of God in themselues, but blessings to vs, in and by Iesus Christ,  must endeuor to vse the Apostles form of praise & thank∣giuing; blessed be God who hath blessed vs with spirit yea & with the temporall blessings we do enioy, in Christ. Some may say how is that to be done?  Labor to haue part in the merit of Christ, to apprehend and apply the merit of his death to thy selfe,  then thou shalt know with comfort, that the good things vouchsafed vnto thee, are giuen as pledges of Gods loue, and are blessings to thee, in and by his merit, and if thy knowledge bee not thus grounded in Christ, it is so far from being comfortable, as it doth let thee
vnderstand to thy discomfort, that the good things giuen vnto thee are but giuen thee to leaue thee without execuse, & for further encrease of thy condemnation. Let this bee thought on, & let it stir vs vp to labour to haue our know∣ledge of al things we enioy in this life, grounded in the me∣rit of Christ, the storehouse and fountaine of all sauing knowledge. The next thing wee are to marke is, that the knowledge of things needfull to be knowne to saluation, laid vp in Christ, is deliuered, not in plaine termes, but vn∣der this comparison, (the treasure of wisedome & know∣ledge) hence we may take vp this conclusion. That sauing knowledge, or knowledge & wisedom vnto  saluation, which is to be found only in Christ, is a thing of great price,Sauing know∣ledge found only in Christ is a thing most preci∣ous. it is a treasure of inestimable worth and excel∣lency, the Apostle sets it downe as a thing whereof he was fully resolued that nothing in the world was able to come neere the worth and excellency of this, other things com∣pared with this, he held them as losse & dung, yea doubt∣lesse (saith hee) I think all things but losse for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things losse, and doe iudge them to bee dung, that I might win Christ, he saith he esteemed not, he made no account of knowing any thing saue Iesus Christ & him crucified, ioyne to this that of the wiseman, where he saith the marchandize of this is better then the marchandize of siluer, and the gaine thereof is better then gold,Prou. 3.14.15.16.17.18. it is more precious then pearles, and all things that thou canst desire, are not to be compared vnto her, &c. The reason of this is plaine.  Sauing knowledge is a thing of greater worth then any thing in the worlde, be∣cause it concernes our euerlasting good, the good of our bodies and soules for euer, other things concerne but our temporary good onely in the time of this life, what shall it profite a man saith our Sauiour though hee winne the whole worlde, if hee loose his owne soule,Mat. 16.26. where hee giues vs to vnderstand, that if a man should gaine the
whole world, it would doe him no good, and all in re∣spect of his euerlasting good, that gaine may stand with the losse of heauen and euerlasting happinesse, therefore sauing knoweledge found in Christ, is a thing of farre greater woorth then any thing in the world. Now this beeing so, that sauing knowledge in Christ is so excellent a treasure wee must labour to bee per∣swaded of the excellency of it,We must la∣bour to be perswaded of the excellen∣cy of sauing knowledge, & to affect it ac∣cording to the excellen∣cy of it. and to bee affected to∣wardes it accordingly, wee must haue our affections en∣larged, and haue euen a couetous desire after this same heauenly treasure (this is an holy couetousnesse) yea, with the wise Merchant, Mat. 13.45. that seeketh good pearles, and hauing found this pearle of great price, wee are to sell all wee haue, wee are to renounce all that nature hath endued vs withall and to despise and set light by all the profits, pleasures, honours and preferments of this life that wee may purchase this pearle of such excellent woorth; and this exhortation was neuer more needefull then now in these dayes wherein most men and women haue their hearts set vppon the world, and though they haue liberty and opportunity, yea, perswasion and encouragement, to store vp the treasures found in Iesus Christ, yet they through greedy desire of the corruptible and casuall treasures of the world, are wholly withheld from seeking this one thing onelie ne∣cessary, what is the cause of this, let vs consider the cause of it, that finding that, wee may labour to remooue it, that so the effect may fall to the ground, surely, the cause of it is this, men are possessed with that conct, of the Laodiceans, Reuel. 3.17. that they are rich, and neede not the riches of Christ, to make them true∣ly rich, they finde not themselues to stand in neede of the precious treasures found in Christ to enrich them, they goe on in a fearefull dulnesse and dead∣nesse of heart, and doe neyther see nor feele
their owne pouerty, and wretchednes. Happily some will say we confesse our selues to bee sin∣ners, therefore wee cannot thinke such a wicked thought,Ob. that we haue no need of Christ. I answere to them that plead thus for themselues,  it may be they confesse themselues to be sinners, and yet withall, they thinke not that they stand in such neede of Christ as they do, (for consider it) do they not many times confesse themselues to be sinners only in generall manner; that all men are sinners, and they among the rest? but come we to the tryall with them in particulars, doe they not then goe about to extenuate, and to excuse their sins, accounting great sinnes, little sinnes, as breaking of the Sabbaoth, customary swearing and the like, I appeale to themselues, whether it bee not so with many, now where these things are, though the mouth say I am a sinner, yet the heart saith no, I stand not in such need of Iesus Christ, and this is that which makes men not to value the riches of Iesus Christ as they ought, we must therefore labour to find our selues stand in neede of the rich treasure found in Christ, yea that wee stand in need of his precious bloud to wash away the least of our sinnes, and that without the rich grace and mercy of God in Iesus Christ, the least of our sinnes makes vs liable to the curse and euerlasting perditi∣on, and then we shall account the treasure of sauing know∣ledge found in Iesus Christ more precious then all the ri∣ches in the world. Consider wee further but this one thing sauing know∣ledge in Christ will stand by vs and comfort vs when all things in the worlde forsake vs,Note. doe not wee see riches ta∣ken away from men, or elsemen taken suddenly away from their riches, neither their siluer nor their golde is a∣ble to deliuer them in the daie of the Lords wrath, &c. Zephan. 1.18. but sauing knowledge in Christ is durable riches, Pro. 8.18. it is a treasure that will continue for euer and minister comfort in the greatest extremity. Let vs
then in wisedome affect this treasure and seeke after it and euen despise all things in the world in respect of it, that so we may lay vp in store a good foundation against the time to come. One thing more obserue we, the Apostle saith the ex∣cellent and precious knowledge of things needfull to bee knowne to saluation are hid in Christ. This considered, together with the relatiue to whom i is hid (namely) to naturall men, doth offer this knowne conclusion. That sauing knowledge found in Christ though it h a thing of great price,The excellen∣cy and worth of sauing knowledge is not known to euery man. yet it is not apparant to  mans eye, euery man seeth not the lustre and beauty f this pretious knowledge, euery mans minde is not  to comprehend the worth of it, no not any mans mind but onely their minds that are opened and enlightned by the Spirit of God, Math. 16.17. our Sauiour saith to Pet, vpon his confession that he was the Christ, flesh & bloud had not reuealed that vnto him, but his Father which it i heauen 1. Cor. 2.14. the naturall man perceiueth not th things of the spirit of God: for they are foolishnesse vn him, neither can hee know them, hee hath neither pow nor possibility in himselfe to know them, let him labo and striue neuer so much, why? because they are spiritually discerned. The reason  is, (as I haue heeretofore shewed.) Because there is no seed of sauing knowledge in nature, it is aboe the reach of nature created in the state of innocency; much more of nature in the state of sinne and corruption. Now then is it so, that sauing knowledge found in Christ, being a most excellent treasure is not knowne, much lesse este∣med so to be, but onely of them, to whom it pleaseth God to discouer it, is it a treasure hidden & kept close from the sight of many in the world? Let then as many as haue it reuealed vnto them be thankfull to God; it is esteemed a great fauor if a rich king
shew to any the house of his Treasure.  Wee read Isai. 39.2. that Hezekiah to gratifie the King of Babels Ambassadour that brought him letters and a present,They that haue the ex∣cellency of sa∣uing know∣ledge reuealed vnto them are to be thankful to God for the same. shewed them the house of the treasures, the siluer and the gold, and the spi∣ces, and the pretious oyntment, and all the house of his ar∣mour, &c. how great a fauour then is it for the Lord, the King of heauen and earth, to shew to vs, yea to giue vs eies to see with comfort, the riches and treasures found in his treasury euen in Iesus Christ better then all the riches and treasures of the world, how much are wee in this regard bound to magnifie the Lords mercy, hee hath not so dealt with euery one, we may see thousands left in this blindnes not able to see the things wee see, yea wee may see in them our owne image, what wee were before the Lord put a difference betweene them and vs. Let it therefore stir vp as many as haue their eyes opened to see with comfort the rich treasures found in Christ, to magnifie and praise the Lord for so great a mercy; yea let our hearts be enlarged, and mouthes opened to praise the Lord for the comforta∣ble sight of this excellent treasure when it pleaseth him to strip vs of earthly riches which happely we had in great a∣boundance. Let vs in such a case and time with Dauid Psal. 42.11.Psal. 42.11. rouse vp our fainting soules and say, why art thou cast downe my soule? and why art thou disquieted within me? Waite on God, for I will yet notwithstanding all this giue thanks to the Lord. It is the councell of the preacher,Eccles. 7.16. In the day of wealth bee of good comfort, and in the day of affliction consider, and what is a man, that is the childe of God, then consider? surely among other things this, that God hath opened to him the dore of his Iewell house, and let him see to his great comfort the tresures that are found in Christ; this a child of God ought to consider in time of the losse of outward riches, the consideration of this will swallow vp all greefe for the losse of those things, & make him still lift vp his heart and open his mouth to blesse the Lord and to say with Dauid, I will yet giue him thanks, for
notwithstanding I haue suffered great losse in outward things, yet I still see to my comfort the Treasures that are found in Christ, and I haue still my part in them which are better then all the treasures in the world. VER. 4. And this I say lest any man should beguile y with entising words. In this verse is laid downe the second generall proposi∣tion handled in this chapterThe second generall pro∣position hand∣led in this chapter. (namely) this. That all things out of Christ are meere deceit and no∣thing worth. And this proposition is deliuered together with the A∣postles purpose in propounding of the former, that he laid before the Colossians the former proposition to this end, that they might not bee deceiued by any thing tendered vnto them out of Christ, all things out of him being meer deceit, the connexion is this. I tell you that in Christ is to bee found full and perfect knowledge of all things needfull to saluation, and thi I speake to this end, that you may be kept from seduce  of deceauers, such as goe about to thrust vpon you any thing out of Christ in the matter of saluation, I tell you their wordes are but entising flattering wordes, their p∣pose is to beguile you, this I say least any should beguile you, &c. So then in this verse wee haue the end of the propoun∣ding of the former proposition, that it was to keepe the Colossians from beeing deceiued by seducers, together with the manner and meanes whereby false impostors, and false teachers commonly vse to deceiue (namely) by entising words, somethings are to bee cleered in the words of this verse, the word translated (beguile) doth proper∣ly signifie to deceiue the ignorant, and simple in reasoning with them, thrusting vpon them an error by false and de∣ceitfull arguments, and reasons (with entising words) (that
is) with colourable speech, probable and plausible, carry∣ing a shew of truth, when indeede there is no truth in it, and hauing in it a power to perswade. Thus then the words are to be conceiued. This I say least any man in reasoning with you cunningly and deceitfully should deceiue you, and impose errours vpon you, and that by manes of his faire probable and deceitfull speech. First, we are heere to marke, that the Apostle taught the Colossians, that in Christ is found full and perfect know∣ledge of all things needfull to saluation, not onely to this end, that they might know this and beleeue it, but that they might by the knowledge of it be kept from errour, that they might thereby be armed and made able to stand against cunning seducers, such as should goe about to be∣guile them, and to corrupt them with errour, vnder colour of truth by faire, slattering, plausible speeches. This ob∣serued the conclusion following hence is this. That sound knowledge of the truth, is not only good in  it selfe, but also an excellent preseruatiue against the delusi∣ons of subtill seducers,Sound know∣ledge of the truth is not onely good in it selfe, but it is also an ex∣cellent preser∣uatiue against the delusions of cunning seducers. and a notable meanes to keepe vs from being deceiued by such as labour to corrupt vs with errour. We finde it worthily expressed by Solomon, Prou 2.10.11.12. When wisedome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge delighteth thy soule. Then shall counsell preserue thee, and vnderstanding shall keepe thee. And deliuer thee from the euill way, and from the man that speaketh froward things, (that is) from the man whose mouth vttereth error, false doctrine, or enticement to sin, Eph. 4. the Apostle shewes that Christ gaue gifts to men, some to be Apostles, & some Prophets, & some Euangelists & some Pastors & teachers, ver. 11. for the building vp of his body the Church, in faith & knowledge, & then ver. the 14. he shewes the vse of that knowledge (namely) this that wee henceforth be no more children wauering, & carried about with euery wind of doctrine, by the deceit of men & with
craftinesse, whereby they lay wait to deceiue. But that we might bee prouided against the deceit and craftinesse of men, which is a plaine proofe of the point in hand, that sound knowledge is a notable means to preserue vs from being ouertaken by the craft of Seducers; and the reason  and ground of this is, that we find Heb. 5.14. such as haue sound knowledge of the truth, haue their wits exercised to discerne betweene good and euill, betweene light and darkenesse, they carry a light within them (which is index sui & obliqui, whereby they are able to discouer what is a∣greeable to the truth, and what is erronious and contrary to the truth, and so cannot be ouer-reached and circum∣uented by such as goe about to deceiue them with errour; would we then in these dangerous dayes wherein so many lie in wait to seduce,  and wee see some drawen to popery, some to Brownisme, some to one errour, and some to ano∣ther, would we be preserued and kept vpright in the truth in the middest and throng of many deceiuers gone out purposely to deceiue, who compasse sea and land to make a childe of the Diuell like to themselues; then let vs labor for sound knowledge of the truth,If we would be kept vp∣right in the truth in the throng of ma∣ny deceiuers we must la∣bor for sound knowledge of the truth. vse with diligence the ordinances of God appointed to that end to beget know∣ledge, it is a reasoning of the flesh, and a beguiling argu∣ment forced vpon some men by strong delusion of Satan, to say thus, there be many seducers, many that goe about to deceiue, therfore we wil neither hear one nor other, or if we heare we will beleeue neuer a Preacher of them all, this is not the way to keepe our selues from being deceiued, no, this is the way to make vs a fit prey for seducers, to seaze vpon, such men as vse thus to speake will heare and be∣leeue prophane and filthy persons, such as will lead thn to lust and lewdnesse, to drunkennesse and all excsse of riot, they will heare and beleeue such as will fill their eares with false tales, and slanderous reports, and poyson their hearts with malice against their brethren, but they hold it dangerous to heare and beleeue such as labour to instruct
them in the truth; as if there were no danger of contagion but from them, it is all one as if they should thus speake, there is none more subiect to be drawen out of the way, then such as vse the best meanes to know the right way, or there is much poyson scattered in many places, therefore at any hand take heed of preseruatiues against it, for what is it but sound knowledge of the truth, gotten by carefull, and conscionable attending on the meanes, that will de∣scry the venome of pestilent opinions, and preserue vs from infection by them, and make vs able to try all things and to hold that which is good, let vs then labour for soundnes of knowledge. But will some say, alas,  I am a poore simple man or wo∣man, who will euer offer to seduce me? popish inchanters or other seducers will neuer meddle with mee, they will rather deale with such as are eminent in place or quality, such as bee of some note in Church or Common-wealth. Indeed,  the Diuell will especially labour to corrupt such persons, knowing that their seduction is a matter of conse∣quence, and that it will draw with it many others, yet thou whosoeuer thou art, be thou neuer so poore or simple, hast a soule to saue, as precious to the Lord as the soule of the greatest, therefore thou hast iust cause to looke to thy selfe, the Diuell by his instruments will be tempering with thee, to corrupt thee with errour; whom do lurking corner cree∣pers so much prey vpon as those that be simple? the Apo∣stle sayth, 2. Tim. 3.6. that deceiuers creepe into houses, and lead captiue simple women, laden with sinnes, and led with diuerse lusts, plead not therefore thy simplicity as sufficient to protect and sheild thee from the assault of se∣ducers, but labour thou for soundnesse of knowledge, that thou mayst be armed against their detestable errours, and for encouragement remember the comfortable call of wisedome, Prou. 9.4. who so is simple let him come hi∣ther, &c. The next thing we haue heere to marke is, that the Apo∣stle
sayth, not least any should force, or by violence driue you from this truth, but least any should beguile you, and vnder the colour of reason deceiue you, and least any by paralogisme and deceitfull reasoning with you, should draw you to errour, hence ariseth this conclusion, That in matters of faith wee haue greater cause to feare deceit and seducement then violenceIn matters of faith and reli∣gion there is greater dāger from seduce∣ment then frō violence. in matter of religion there is greater danger of corruption by smooth deceiuers, then there is of hurt by open persecutours, 2. Cor. 11.2. the Apostle fayth, in this regard hee was iealous ouer the Corinthians, and verse 3. he feared least the Serpent begui∣led Eue through his subtilty, so their mindes should hee corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ, hee sheweth the reason of that iealousie and feare verse 13.14.15. be∣cause false Apostles were deceitfull workers, transforming themselues into the Apostles of Christ, and no maruell sayth the Apostle, for Satan, whose ministers they are, i transformed into an Angell of light, and therefore it is no great thing, though his ministers bee so, the reason of the Apostle stands thus, which is also a reason and proofe of the point in hand. False teachers and deceiuers carry before them a sem∣blance, and make shew of the truth of religion, of piety & of goodnes, & by that means do easily get within mens bo¦soms, and seat themselues vpon their hearts without resi∣stance, the opinion that is had of their piety and goodnes, giues easie passage to their coloured poyson, to enter into the very bowels of mens soules, but as for open persecu∣tours they haue no such aduantage their malice and mad∣nesse is euident to euery man, and may better be auoyded, and therfore they are lesse dangerous then cunning decei∣uers, it is a maxime and knowen truth, taught by common experience, that a kissing & embracing enemy is far more dangerous then a threatning, open and professed fo, the Scripture is full of examples of this kinde, Ioab 2. Sam. 29.9. Iudas and many others.
Now this being so, that in matters of religion, there is  greater danger of corruption from seducers,We must wa∣rily auoyd the pestilent breath of de∣ceiuers in matters of re∣ligion. then of hurt by open persecutors, it must teach vs to be most wary that the pestilent breath of deceiuers neuer infect vs. Let vs keepe our eares from harkening to their smooth perswasi∣ons, as we would refraine from one that had some infecti∣ous disease vpon him, and let vs follow the counsell of our Sauiour, Mat. 7.15. beware of false Prophets, which come to you in sheepes cloathing, but inwardly they are raue∣ning woolues. How shall we know false teachers?Ob. Our Sauiour hath taught vs in the next verse,  yee shall know them by their fruits. And that this rule of discer∣ning false teachers bee not mistaken, as it is of many, we must know the proper fruit of a Prophet or Teacher, as he is a Prophet, is his doctrine, it is not his life and con∣uersation, for that may deceiue vs, if Saint Paul a perse∣cutour was vnblameable, touching the righteousnesse which is in the Law, Phil. 3.6. and he demeaned himselfe, so as no man could iustly taxe him, then doubtles a decei∣uer, who puts on a visard of holinesse, of purpose to deceiue may seeme to vs to excell in holinesse, if we iudge of him by that appearance we may be deceiued, it is therefore the proper fruit of a Prophet as he is a Prophet (namely) his doctrine by which we are to iudge of him, & this is cleere by the like speech, Luk. 6.44. euery tree , if then the doctrine bee good, the teacher as hee is a teacher is good, for he must not onely be a teacher, but a patterne of good works, with vncorrupt doctrin, with gra∣uity and integrity, Tit. 2.7. if then we would know a true teacher from a false, let vs looke to his doctrine, and as S. Iohn sayth, 1. Epist. 4.1. try the spirits (that is) the doctrines of men, if we finde them consonant and consenting with the word of God, founded on Iesus Christ incarnate, and propounding spirituall worship of God, agreeable to his will and nature, then is the teacher a true teacher, but if
otherwise we finde his doctrine, either dissenting from the word, or not grounded on Iesus Christ incarnate, or as the Apostle saith, Gal. 6.12. making a faire shew in the flesh; then let vs take heed of him, and not suffer such an one to disgorge his venome into our bosomes, there is greater danger from him then from an open and professed enemy of religion; and that wee may yet further see the danger that comes by deceiuers, consider we this one thing, Note.He that is violently forced, and by terrour ouercome, and by extremity of tortures and paine made to deny the knowen truth sinnes greatly, yet he may retaine the know∣ledge of the truth, and afterwards he may repent and rise againe, and come to confesse it, but hee that is drawen a∣way by imposters and deceit, not only falles from the con∣fession of the truth, but loseth the knowledge of the truth and embceth errour in steed of truth, & at length comes to this, that the truth hee before loued and confessed hee now hates, and doth persecute with bitter enmity and op∣positions against it, examples of this kind we haue in Scrip∣ture as Himineus and Philetus, Hermogenes and Alexander the copper smith. Let this then admonish vs to take more then ordinary heed of deceiuers,We must wa∣rily auoyd the infection of deceiuers also in matters of life & maners. and in that deceiuers are so dangerous we are to thinke vpon it further, and it must teach vs most warily to auoyd the infection of deceiuers, not onely in matters of faith, but in matters of life and manners, for doubtlesse as Salomon sayth, Prou, 11.9. an hypocrite with his mouth hurts his neighbour, he doth not onely corrupt his minde with erroneous opinions, but many time stirre vp his heart to sinnefull lusts, and peruert his wayes to vn∣godly behauiour: In plaine termes we are most heedfully, and warily to auoyd such as perswade vs to any sinne, vn∣der colour of pleasure, profit or preferment, and so seeke to beguile vs, they are more dangerous enemies of our soules, then such as goe about to force vs to sin, and we are in speciall manner to take heede of our owne inborne be∣guiling
enemy, I meane our naturall corruption, the ser∣pent that lies in our owne bosome, that is a deceiuing ene∣my, the greatest enemy wee haue, euen greater then the Diuell though he bee a seducer to sinne,Note. the Diuell could neuer preuaile to bring vs to any sinne but by meanes of that, it may seeme strange that any man should play the Sophister with himselfe, yet thus men doe, by meanes of their owne inborne corruption, for example, such as are onely hearers of the word, & not doers of it, they through their owne corruption thinke all is well enough with them and so play the Sophisters with themselues, Iam. 1 22. be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiuing your owne soules, this beguiling enemy our owne corruption▪ makes men many times thinke they haue faith, when in∣deed it is nothing but pride and presumption, and that that they repent when it is nothing but a deceitfull coun∣terfetting and hypocrisie, we must therfore especially take heed of this beguling dangerous enemy. Some may say, how is that to be done? I answer,  first together with the examination of our own harts, with a search made to find out the depth and deceit of our owne corruption, wee are to pray for strength of grace against it, and neuer rest till wee receiue the Lords answere to Paul, 2. Corinth. 12.9. my grace is sufficient for thee. Secondly, wee are to carry, and cherish in our hearts an vniuersall hatred of all and euery sinne, Psal. 119.128. I esteeme all thy precepts most iust, and hate all false waies; and not to giue libertie to our owne corruption, to breake out into any knowne sinne, we cannot but sinne as long as we are in this life, but let it be against our purpose, and if we thus search and finde out owne corruption, and be in∣stant with the Lord for strength of grace against it, & carry in a vniuersall hatred of euery knowen sinne, we shall be able, in some measure, to decline the deceit of our owne beguiling corruption.
Come we to the manner and means whereby false tea∣chers vse to deceiue in the wordes following (with entising words) That which is offered vnto vs from hence, is this. That false teachers haue for the most part sweet tongues,False teachers for rhe most part hue sweet tongues as the Lord saith by his Prophet Ierem. 23.31.32. Behold I will come against the Prophets, saith the Lord, which haue sweet tongues &c. deceiuers commonly bring pro∣bable reasons and perswasiue arguments, and as the Apo∣stle saith, Rom. 16.18. with faire speech they deeiue the simple,  and the reason of this is. Because the Diuell knowes the force of this weapon, the power of a flattering perswasiue speech, he vsed it himselfe in his first temptati∣on ye shall be as Gods, &c. and preuailed; therefore hee sends foorrh his Ministers furnished with this power, that as true Teachers come in the euidence of the Spirit of God; so false teachers in demonstration of the spirit of Sa∣tan, with all deceiueablenesse both of word and deed. This may serue, not onely to let vs see, whence it is that many at this day are deceiued by Popish seducers,We are not to esteeme of a∣any speech in matters of faith by the outward he∣bit and forme of words. because they come prouided with intising and glosing speaches, and haue taught their tongues to speake lies, &c. Ierem. 9.5. And vnder glorious titles of Church, of Councels, Fathers, Antiquity, Consent, &c. haue insnared many a simple soule: but it serues also, to teach vs, not to esteeme of any speech, especially in matters of faith, by the out∣ward habite and forme of words, and as it is clothed with likelyhood, or probability, for so wee may bee deceiued, for example, when the Papists say, it is not likely that our prouident Sauiour Iesus Christ, in the institution of the Sacrament of his Supper, would deliuer it in obscure and ambiguous termes, because that might cause much strife, and contention, and the mistaking of it might breed Ido∣latry, tht we worship for Christ, that which is not Christ, or impiety, that wee should not giue to it, beeing Christ, God, and man, diuine honour, heere is a probable speech,
but indeed no truth in it, if we looke beyond the probabi∣lity of it, for Christ did not deliuer his mind in the institu∣tion of the sacrament in obscure termes, but after the man∣ner of the Scripture in such termes as were vsuall and com∣mon to sacraments, as might be proued, againe their infe∣rence that the mistaking of it might breed idolatry, is groū∣ded on a meere deuice of their owne, for there is no wor∣ship due to the sacrament, & so no danger of idolatry, thus then we see we are not to esteem of any speech by the like∣lyhood, but we are to examine the substance of it, yea, let vs neuer measure any doctrine by the outward manner of deliuering of it: it is iust with the Lord to make such as heare men in respect of eloquence & outward ornaments, to heare without profit, because they depend vpon the wit of men, and not vpon the wisdome of God, who only doth create the fruit of the lips to be peace Isay. 17.19. a speech worthy marking, it is as proper to the Lord to giue peace and comfort by the speech of man, as to giue being and forme to a creature, and therefore as man is not able to do the one, no more can he doe the other, so it is iust with the Lord let them heare without profit who depend vpon the wit and eloquence of man. VER. 5. For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, reioycing and beholding your order, and your stedfst faith in Christ. This ver. dependeth on the former as a reeson of the A∣postles care expressed in the former ver. that the Colossians might be kept from the seducement of such as should goe about to beguile them with enticing words the reason is this, because the Apostle was acquainted with the state & condition of their Church, and this reason is couched to∣gether with an answer to a question they might make, how he should come to the knowledge of their state, being absent, and far remooued from them, to this the Apostle answers that though he was absent in the flesh, yet was he
with them in the Spirit, reioycing and beholding their or∣der and their stedfast faith in Christ. This is the summe and substance of this verse, in it wee haue more particularly these things to consider. First, a preuention of a question that might be made by the Colossians, how possibly the Apostle could come to be acquainted with their estate, seeing he was absent from thē this the Apostle meets withall in the first words by a distin∣ction, that his absence was in regard of his body and not of his spirit (Though I be absent in the flesh, &c. Now be∣cause there might yet remaine some scruple, and doubt in the mindes of the Colossians, admitting his presence with them in the spirit; for that might be without knowledge of their estate, as a man may be with his friends far distant from him in conceipt, in mind and good will, and yet bee ignorant of their estate & welfare, the Apostle therefore in the second place sets downe the effect of his presence in the spirit with the Colossians, to proue that he was present with them, not in bare conceit & mind, but so as he was ac∣quainted with their state, as (namely) that it brought forth ioy & reioycing, & that is further amplified by the means whereby that reioycing was wrought (namely) by sight, and not by heare say, reioycing and beholding, which doth also proue the truth of his presence with them in the spirit, that he was so present▪ that he did looke on them, as if hee had beene bodily present, and that his beholding of them, is further enlarged by the matter and obiect of it, and that twofold, beholding their order and stedfast faith in Christ, that hee seeing their order and their stedfast faith in Christ, reioyced. Now before wee come to handle the parts of this verse in particular one thing of good vse and consequence is to be obserued from it in generall, we are to marke that this verse is inferd vpon the former as a reason of the Apostles eare, expressed in the former verse, hee was carefull that none should beguile them, why so? because he was present with them in his spirit and saw their good or∣der
and stedfast faith in Christ, that reason is to be marked, a man would thinke he should rather haue thus reasoned. I am with you in spirit, & I see some go about to beguil you therfore I am carefull that no man beguil you, but he saith not so, but I see your good order, therfore I am carefull that no man seduce you; from this manner of reasoning wee may take out this profitable lesson. That in our best estate when we thinke our selues most  free from danger of temptation, yea,When we thinke our selues most free from dā∣ger of tempta∣tion, then are we to be vigi∣lant and wary and to watch ouer our own harts & liues. Rom. 11.20. 1. Cor. 10.12. when we find our selus most strong by the strength of grace & faith to withstand the assaults & temptations of Satan, or his in struments la∣boring to beguile vs, & to draw vs to error in iudgment, to lust of hart, or to any sinfull action, euen then are we to bee vigilant, circumspect & wary, & to watch ouer our owne harts & liues, the Apostle was carefull to keep the Colossi∣ans from seducement, when he knew them well ordred & stedfast in faith; So must we in our best & most secure e∣state, as it may seeme to vs, feare & be carefull to auoid the danger of temptation, the Apostle saith to such as stand by faith, be not high minded but fear, & let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed least he fall, which places make no∣thing against assurance of saluation in true beleeuers as the Papists vrge them, but are admonitions to stir them vp to vse means of securing themselues, by warines, & do prooue the point in hand, that euen thē when we stand & are sted∣fast in faith, wee are with all circumspection, to auoid the danger of temptation, if we call to mind the place where, & the time whē our first parents were deceiued, we shal ea∣sily yeild to the necessity of this duty, the place where they were tempted, seduced and ouerthrown, was Paradice, the time when, in their state of innocency. Now let no man vpō this conclude, therfore sinfull men though they be true be∣leeuers may wholly & finally fall frō God, for there is not the same reason of the grace & creation,Note. & the grace of re∣generation, by the grace of creation man, or Angell hath a power either to stand or fall, & this power is in it selfe but
by the grace of regeneration such feare of God is put into the hearts of the regenerate,Ier. 32.40. that they shall not wholly fall from God, & this power of not falling from God is in them indeede but not from themselues (but that by the way) in that our first parents were tēpted & fell in Paradice in time of their innocency, it makes it most cleere (which is the in∣tention of my speech) that in our best estate, we are not to be secure & think our selues free (I say not from tēptation) but from the danger of temptation; & therfore in our best estate when we haue most strēgth of grace, we are to be vi∣gilant & to watch ouer our selues, least Satan circumuent vs, we see our duty, and that it may be thought vpon with profit, we must know that when Satan cannot preuail with vs to make vs comit grosse sins,  when (we hauing strength of grace to withstand him) he cannot make vs sin by swea∣ring,The duty vr∣ged by an ar∣gument from Satns subtil∣ty in temp∣ting vs to sin. drunkennes, pride in apparell or other like fruits of ig∣norance, & of an vnreformed soule, then hee will assaile vs with some spirituall temptation, for example, he will seeke to poison our soules with inward pride, to make vs (if possi∣bly he can) to swell, and to be lift vp in regard of that very grace giuen, to with stand temptation, we therfore (euen as many as make conscience of known sins) are to watch ouer our hearts in this respect, least Satan get within our harts, and by his subtilty crewe be aware corrupt them, with this secret pride, & consider, that it is not enough for vs to dis∣allow this corruption, as happily at the hearing of this ex∣hortation, some will say; Oh, God forbid I should so foget my selfe as to think highly of that strength God hath giuen me, & to be lift vp wirh a conceit of that, I know it to be a sinne, and I vtterly disallow it, consider I say, that this is not sufficient, the Diuell will suffer vs to goe thus farre as in iudgement wee disallow it, so in affection wee must humble our selues in feare and prayer before the Lord, knowing this, that at one time or other, wee may bee tempted and sollicited by Satan, to this sinne of secret pride, and if in iudgement onely we disallow it, and bee
not humbled in feare and prayer against it, we shall not be able to stand in time of temptation, our Sauiour there∣fore hath taught vs, and he often repeats it, that wee are to watch and pray, that we fall not into temptation, it is woorth our marking that hee sayth, Mark. 13.33. take heed or looke, watch and pray, for ye know not when the time is, as if he had sayd, it is not enough for you to looke about you, to espy this or that sinne, but you are to watch ouer yourselues in regard of temptation to it, yea, to bee humbled in feare and prayer, that you may be strengthe∣ned against it. Come wee to the particular parts of this verse,Interpreta∣tion. and first of the preuention of the question, the Colossians might make in these words, though I bee absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, by the word (flesh) wee are to vnder∣stand his body, as appeares plainely, 1. Cor. 5.3. and by the word (spirit) the minde and that not in substance, or any essentiall faculty, but in act or operation of his mind, the apprehension or vision of his minde, and that in truth, not in phantasie, his minde being enabled by the Spirit of God, truely to see and behold the state of the Colossians, thus then these wordes are to bee conceiued, though I bee absent from you in my body, yet am I present with you in the apprehension and vision of my minde, enabled by the Spirit of God, truely to see and behold your state. Many things might hence with profit be noted, but that  which I will insist vpon is this, hence it is cleere,A mans body and his minde in respect of the apprehen∣sion & thoght of it may bee farre disioy∣ned one from the other. that a mans body and his minde, in regard of the apprehension, cogitation and thought of it, may be farre disioyned, the body may be in one placc & the mind in another, the A∣postle in his body was at Rome, in his mind with the Co∣lossians, our owne experience teacheth this, we can witnes it, that our bodies are sometimes in one place, when our minds are in another, if we desire proofe by plaine text of Scripture Isa. 29.13. this people, saith the Lord, come neer
vnto me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but haue remooued their heart far from me, againe, Ezek. 33.31. the Lord saith, the people come as they vse to come, and sate before the Prophet, & heard his words, but would not do them, for with their mouths they made iests, their hearts were wandering after their couetousnesse, their mindes were vpon their profits in the world. We see then the truth of this, that the thought of the minde and the body may be,When our mindes are sent out of our bodies in the thoughts of them they are to be well be∣stowed. & are sometime farre disioy∣ned. We are therefore to take heed that our mindes when they are sent out of our bodies be well bestowed, that they doe not straggle and and wander out into filthy lusts and proud imaginations, to thinke of new fashions, to bitter grudging, or into idle, vaine & foolish conceits it is accoun∣ted by many for a part of mans liberty, that thought is free, but they that take that liberty, are brought into most gree∣uous slauery, to becom slaues to their own wicked thoghts and vassals to the Diuell: wee must remember to bestow our minds wel, when they are sent out of our bodies, in the cogitations of them, & especially in the actions of religion and diuine worship, as in hearing the word, in prayer, &c. in hearing the word, we are to looke that our thoughts be spent vpon the word deliuered. In prayer that our mindes be lift vp to heauen, & wholly exercised in thinking on the goodnes, mercy, truth, might, power & maiesty of the Lord to whom we pray,Eccles. 5.1. so hath our Sauior taught vs to say, Our Father which art in heauen, &c. and it is Solomons reason, that we should not be rash with our mouths, nor that our harts should be hasty to vtter a thing before God, why? be∣cause God is in heauen, and we are on the earth, therfore in praier to lift vp our harts, & to spend our thoughts wholly in thinking on the power, goodnes, mercy, truth and glo∣rious Maiesty of the Lord. Now in this duty many are much defectiue, and many of vs in time of praier, rather think of any thing, then of the mighty power & Maiesty of him before whom we stand, we gaze here & there, we note
this man, that woman, their gesture, their apparell, yea, the least toy that is about them, or els our minds are wandring after our pleasures or profits abroad; our owne hearts can tell vs, that thus it it is with many of vs, and this being so, we must know it is iust with the Lord to cast out our peti∣tions, & to returne our prayers empty vnto vs againe, yea, to send them backe with a curse insteed of a blessing, they are abominable to the Lord, as himselfe hath sayd, incense is an abomination vnto me, &c. why was incense an abo∣mination to the Lord, surely, because such as offred it,Isa. 1.13. did not offer it with inward truth of a sound hart, so if our prai∣ers be offred to God, & our thoghts be carried clean away from him, they are abominable to him, and the sacrifice of fooles. Let vs then labour in hearing the word, in prayer & in other holy exercises, to set our selues in the presence of God, to thinke vpon his glorious Maiesty, and remem∣ber withall God house is his chamber of presence, wherein we offer and present our soules and the secrers of our harts to be seene and censured of the Lord, Come wee now to the effect of the Apostles presence with the Colossians, wherby he proues that he was present with them in spirit (namely) his reioycing, the word reioy∣cing is heere to be taken in the naturall & proper significa∣tion of it, that his heart was affected with ioy and comfort, in regard of the good order he saw among the Colossians, wee are to consider this effect together with the present state of the Apostle, he was then absent in body from the Colossians, yea, his body was held from them in prison at Rome, when he thus reioyced for their good order, and stedfast faith, he was then in his owne body afflicted, when his hart was thus affected with ioy for the good of the Co∣lossians, this considered; the poynt instruction arising from hence is this. That wee are not to suffer our soules (as it were) to bee  drowned in our owne sence and feeling, either of good or euill, our affections of ioy and sorrow, for it is true in both)
are not to be kept within compasse of that we feele in,Our ioy and our sorrow are not to be kept within compasse of that we feele in or vpon our selues but our hearts are to reioyce or to be greeued as occasion is offered from the Church of God. or vpon our selues, but our hearts are to bee resolued, and further to breake out either in ioy or sorrowe, as occasi∣on is offered from the Church, and people of God, wee are, after the example of the Apostle, euen then when our selues are afflicted, to ioy and reioyce at the hea∣ring or sight of Gods mercy, and blessing vppon his Church and people, and againe, when our owne estate is prosperous, euen then to sorrowe and bee greeued for the affliction and misery of the Church and people of God; wee see the first of these prooued in the example of the Apostle in this place, and againe, 1. Thess. 3.7.8.9. hee sayth, when hee heard good tydings of the faith and loue of the Thessalonians, that he had consolation in all his affliction and necessity; that hee was aliue if they stood fast in the Lord, that he could not render due thanks to God, for all the ioy wherewith hee reioyced for their sakes before God. For proofe of the second, that when we enioy health & prosperity, we are to sorrow & to be greeued for the affli∣ction & trouble of the Church & people of God, which we either see or heare of, excellent & memorable is the exam∣ple of Nehemiah chap. 1.4. though he for his owne parti∣cular was in health, & high place, much fauored of the king yet when he hard of the affliction & distresse of Ierusalem, he saith he sat downe, & wept & mourned certaine daies, & fasted & prayed before the God of heauen, yea, he could not smother or dissemble his griefe, it appeared in his face insomuch as the king perceiued it, and demanded of him why his countenance was sad chap. 2.2. Adde to this that of Daniel, who though himselfe was in great honour and e∣stimation, preferd aboue all the princes of Persia, & second to the King, yet in the middest of his prosperity, when he saw the captiuity still continued, Gods worship decaied, Gods people oppressed, his hart was heauy, his soul melted within him, & he humbled his soule with fasting & praier,
and thus wee see it made cleare vnto vs, by the the exam∣ple of such as were guided by the spirit of God, that our affections of ioy and sorrow are to be tempered not onely according to the sense of good or euill vpon our selues, but as occasion is offered from the Church of God. And the reason of this may be taken from that simpa∣thy and fellow feeling one member hath of the suffering,  or honour of another, laid downe by the Apostle, 1. Cor. 12.26. If one member suffer, all suffer with it, if one mem∣ber bee had in honour, all the members reioice with it. Now if many members suffer, or reioice with one, accor∣ding to the state and condition of it, then surely must one member suffer with many, though it selfe bee honoured, and it must reioice with many, though it selfe be afflicted: and this doth conuince those of sinne, whose hearts are ei∣ther dilated, and lift vp with ioy, or contracted and depres∣sed with griefe, as they feele, either good,  or euill on them∣selues, and neuer regard the prosperity,Reproofe of such as either reioyce or are greeued as they feele ei∣ther good or euil on them∣selues, and ne∣uer regard the prosperity or affliction of Gods church. or affliction of the Church of God: It is a true signe of a sanctified heart, and of a heart that hath fellowship with the Church and peo∣ple of God, to reioice for the good of the Church when we our selues are afflicted, and to be grieued for the affliction of the Church, when we haue all things at will; yea it is an infallible signe of our true loue to Gods glory: if when our estate is prosperous, we can grieue for the troubles of the Church, heard of, or seene; but if our hearts be so ta∣ken vp with the consideration of our owne prosperity, that sorrow for th'affliction of the Church cannot enter, and if wee cannot more sorrow in the sorrow of the Church, then reioice in our owne ioy, wee haue cause to feare that out hearts are not rightly affected to Gods glory: and to descend to some particular, let vs in this respect exa∣mine our owne hearts, how they stand affected in re∣gard of the present dearth, and scarsity, now begunne a∣mongst vs: and further to bee feared, happily many of vs hauing better meanes then others, are not hitherto pinch∣ed
with it, onely thus farre that wee liue at greater charge then heretofore we did, but we are not so neerely touched with it as the poorer sort, who doubtlesse feele the smart of it. Now let vs examine whether we bee any thing grie∣ued beyond that wee feele, or beyond that wee feare, to come vpon our selues, whether wee haue in vs Iobs affecti∣on, Iob 30.25. whether wee now weepe with them that are already in trouble, whether our soules be now in hea∣uinesse for the poore already pinched: come to the triall and duely examine the matter, we shall finde our selues far short of this affection, doe not we still continue our vani∣ties, and superfluities, our great excesse in our feasting, wherein euery one makes a feast like to that of Nabal, 1. Sam. 25.36. What shall I say, of that brutish sinne of drun∣kennesse, to which some still cleaue so fast, as nothing can remoue them from delighting in it, till the meanes where∣by it is fostered be violently taken from them, as the Lord threatneth Ioel 1.5- Awake yee drunkards, and weepe and howle all yee drinkers of Wine: because os the new Wine for it shall be pulled from your mouth; doe not these things witnesse against vs, and make it most cleere to the world, and to our owne soules that we are far from fel∣low feeling, and fellow grieuing for the afflictions of our poore brethren? Nay, do they not make it known that we are such as stand at defiance with the Lord; and that wee dare confront him & iustle with his iudgements, & feare not to rush on that woe. Isay 11.12. Well, let vs in the feare of God be admonished to take heede of this standing out with the Lord, doe wee prouoke him to anger, and not bring confusion vpon our selues, let vs remember that though wee yet feele not the smart of this famine, yet wee are to be touched with griefe and sorrow for the distresse of our poore brethren in this kinde, and in testimony of our true touch of heart, for them, to abridge our selues of that variety, that excesse, and superfluity in diet, wee were wont to vse,Note. riot and excesse in eating and drinking is a
grieuous sinne at all times, but now it is a crimson sinne, a sinne of a double die, because now the Lord doth call in speciall manner to moderation: marke how the Prophet sets out the sinne of the people of his time, by this very circumstance, Isay 22.12. In that day when the Lord God of Hoasts did call vnto weeping, and mourning, and to baldnesse, and to girding with sackcloath, in that very dy there was ioy and gladnesse, slaying oxen, and killing sheepe, eating flesh, and drinking wine, so if we now giue our selues to excessiue eating and drinking, it is a farre greater sinne then it is at other times. It followeth, (beholding your order) the Apostle was enabled by the spirit of God in truth and not in phantasie, to behold the state of the Colossians. Whence, first wee  may note, That the Apostle had the Spirit of God in extraordina∣rie manner, euen to let him see the state of Churches farre remoued from him, yea he had the spirit of discerning, to know the state of particular persons, and so might lawful∣ly pray against particular persons,Paul had Gods spirit in extraordinary manner and could discern the state of particular per∣sons, & might pray, against particular persons. as he did against Alex∣ander the copper Smith, 2. Tim. 4.14. because he was a∣ble to discerne who were incurable enemies of God and who were not, and was carried with a pure zeale to Gods glory, not mixed with hatred,  or corrupt desire of re∣uenge. Thus may not we doe, being but ordinary men and indued with ordinary gifts:Woe beeing both ordina∣rie men, and endued with ordinary gifts may not doe as Paul did. we may pray against the bad cause the wicked enemies of God maintaine, simply, and absolutly, but against their persons with this conditi∣on, if otherwise the good estate of the Church cannot continue, or Religion be preserued. We are furtherto mark, that the Apostle saith, he behol∣ding  the good order amōg the Colossians reioiced;It is a great comfot to the godly to see others wel ordered and truly religious Hence wee may gather that it is a matter of great comfort to the godly minded, to see others well ordered, and stedfast in the faith, fearing God. And religious Dauid saith, He re∣ioyced when they said vnto him they would goe into the
house of the Lord, Psal. 122.1. It did him good at the heart, to see others forward in the seruice of God, and and their be many reasons why the godly minded doe re∣ioice to see others fearing God, and religious. First, because they loue God, and think all to little that is done in his seruice, therefore they reioice when they haue helpers and such as will ioine with them in that ser∣uice. Secondly, because they loue the Church of God they are glad when they see that number encreased. Thirdly, because they know such as feare God, will loue them and vse all good behauiour towards them, as the saying is, Like wil to like, and vse al kindnes one to an other, therefore the godly minded reioice when they see others renued according to the image of God like to themselues. This being so, it a cleare case on the contrary that such are grieued and pine at them that feare God,Such as can∣not abide thē tht fear God but hate them and rroach them are farre fom the minds & Spi∣rit of Gods children. Psal. 15.1.4. and cannot abide them (as the fashion of some is in this wicked age) such as spare not to breake out and to loade them with scornefull, and opprobrious termes, those are farre of from the minde and spirit of Gods children; yea, they shew themselues to beare the image of wicked Kain who flew his brother, and why? because saith Iohn, 1. Epistle 3.12. his owne workes were euill and his brothers good; yea, they beare the expresse image of the Deuill himselfe, who no sooner saw the image of God imprinted in man, but he sought to deface it, It is made a note of him that shall dwell in the Lords tabernacle and rest in his holy moun∣taine, that he honoureth them that feare the Lord: and on the contrary, it must needes fall heauy on such as hate them, and repine at them, that is a signe they shall neuer dwell in the Lords tabernacle, but shall bee cast out from his presence for euer, and this ought to stir vs vp to be glad and reioyce, yea to take much delight in seeing others reli∣gious and fearing God, and to honour them, and to make
much of them, it is a sure signe that grace is truly wrought in our own harts, when we from the hart delight to see the image of it in others; The particular things the Apostle saw with ioy among the Colossians are expressed in the last words, your order and stedfast faith in Christ, by the word Order we are to vnderstand the manner of gouerne∣ment Ecclesiasticall, that was amongest the Colossians,Interpreta∣tion. the good order they held and kept in the regiment of their Church, together with the vigilancy, care and dili∣gence of all men in their seuerall orders and degrees a∣mongest them, that all and euery one was carefull to doe his duety in his place, and calling, that I gather from the contrary expressed by the Apostle, 2. Thessalonians 3.11. there are some which walke among you () inor∣dinately, contrary to  or  good order, and the Apostle explanes himselfe in the wordes following, they worke not at all, they are negligent, idle, and busie bodies, medling in matters that concerne them not, as the Apostle saith of idle hus-wiues, they goe about from house to house, ye they are not onely idle, but also prat∣lers and busie-bodies, &c. 1. Timothy 5.13. this then is the very meaning of the Apostle, that hee in spirit saw the good gouernement of their Church, and the vigilancie care and diligence of euery one in his owne place and calling. First, let it bee heere obserued, that the Apostle looking  on the Ecclesiasticall order,Church go¦uernment be∣ing seen to be dfectiue ought to af∣fect the godly minded with greefe and sor∣row, but it is no sufficient cause of sepa∣ration. and Church gouernment that was amongst the Colossians, and seeing that to be good he reioyced. Hence we may gather by implication on the contrary. That the behoulding of bad Church gouernment, or of some defect in it, is to worke in such as are godly minded a greefe, and sorrow of heart, a mourning for that want, for that there is warrant, both by rule and example in the worde of God, I might shew it more at large but for that very cause, because there bee defects in the gouern∣ment
of the Church, to make separation from the church, I see no sufficient ground for that, this is the case of the separatists at this day,  who because they conceaue some defects in the gouernement of our Church,Confutation of the separa∣tists of our time. therfore rend themselues of, and make separation from vs. I know they alleadge that our Church is Antichristian, and therefore they ought not to communicate with vs,  but to come out from among vs, according to the rule of the Apostle, 2. Cor. 6.17. but indeede it is more then they are able to prooue, if they hold our Church to bee Anti∣christian,  then must it needs be such a Church as makes shew of professing Christ,, and yet is an enemy to Christ, in fundamental poynts of religion, for so doth Antichrist, & all his adherents; Now this they are neuer able to proue; it is a thing to bee considered, that our Church hath the same gouernment, and holdeth the same fundamentall points of religion, that the Church did in the time of king Edward the sixt, and many that then liued afterward suffe∣red in Queen Maries time, and are accounted Martyrs by the separatists themselues, now no member of an Anti∣christian Church can truly be called a martyr, for a mar∣tyr is a witnesse to the truth, and therefore doubtlesse our Church is a true Church of God, I could wish that this might bee duely considered by the separatists, and such as incline to separation. Let it bee further obserued, that one particular thing seene by the Apostle among the Colossians that gaue him contentment, and that hee saw with much delight and  with reioycing, was the care and diligence of all orders, and degrees amongst them,Diligence & orderly wal∣k ng in our particular cal∣ling is plea∣sing to God, and to al good men. that euery man walked order∣ly and diligently in his place and callng. Hence it is cleere that diligence and orderly walking in a mans place and calling, is a thing both pleasing to God (for it is agreeable to his commandement) and a thing al∣so pleasing and delightsome to good men, it doth mini∣ster vnto them matter of ioy and reioysing, they delight to
see it, we may obserue that Dauid Psalm 122. reioyced not onely to see that God had accomplished his promise, and placed his Arke in Sion, but that there was good order in the city of Ierusalem, there was carefull and conscionable execution of Iustice, and iudgement, verse 5. there were thrones set for iudgement, euen the thrones of the house of Dauid, it did glad Dauids heart to see thrones of iustice erected, and iudges and other officers carefully executing their office and function, the reasons of it are these. First good men, such as feare God, they know that God  hath set a comely order of the societies of mankind, both in Church and common wealth, that euery one should be seruiceable to others, which order is preserued and vp∣held by carefull and diligent performance of duties in the seuerall places and callings of men, and is interrupted and broken by the contrary, by sloath and negligence, therfore they much reioyce to see men diligent and painefull in their places and callings. A gaine good men know that careful walking in a mans  place and calling, in conscience to Gods commandement, is a certaine marke of the feare of God, for the fear of God workes in men obedience to the word, and the worde tea∣cheth euery man to walke carefully in his place and cal∣ling, therefore they reioyce to see men so walking, and so expressing the feare of God in their liues, wee see then the trueth of this, that diligent and orderly walking in a mans place and calling, is a thing that drawes from good men good liking, and doth minister vnto them matter of  reioycing. Would we then by good meanes gaine the good liking and approbation of good men,If wee would gain the good liking & ap∣probation of good men we must walk di∣ligently & or∣derly in our seuerll cal∣lings. which is a thing to bee thought on, as the Apostle teacheth, Philip. 4.8. a good name is much to be sought after Pro. 22.1. and that indeed is a good name when men heare well, for good things and of good men, it is no true honour to bee magnified of a multitude, and applauded of neuer so many wicked men
would we by good meanes haue the good liking of good men, and doe that which may minister vnto them matter of ioy. Let vs then looke that we walke diligently, and or∣derly in our seuerall place, and callings. Ob.Happily some will say this is a needlesse and vnseasona∣ble exhortation, we are well ordered in this respect, we are such as walke painefully in our places and callings, indeed it cannot be denied, but that some are diligent and paine∣full in their places,  they rise earely, and eate the breade of carefulnesse, I hope in conscience to Gods commaunde∣ment, but be there none that liue inordinately? I wish it were so, but I may not iustifie the wicked, I must needs tell you, there be many that cannot wash their hands & cleare themselues of this sinne of inordinate walking, are there not many that spend many daies from morning to night in the tauerne, on the Ale-bench, is the number small of such as are common gadders to stage-playes? doe not troopes and multitudes flocke vnder those banners dis∣played by the Deuill? and if this be not to bee disordered, and to liue inordinately, I know not what it is, and since I haue begunne to discouer this sinne of running to stage-playes; let me a little further in compassion to such as are guilty of this sinne,The danger of that sin of go∣ing to stage-plyes. make knowne the greatnesse and dan∣ger of it, and to this purpose consider wee these three things. First, diligent and orderly walking in a mans place, (as we haue heard) makes the heart of good men reioyce, and on the contrary to see men walking inordinately must needs greeue the hearts, and vexe the soules of good men, and that is a thing not lightly to bee regarded, it was no small matter when the Lord told Zenacherib that Sion des∣pised him, and laughed him to scorne Isay 37.22. so it is no light matter when the godly minded are iustly greeued marke what the Apostle saith, 1. Pet. 4.14. if such as belong to Christ be railed on, that rayling reacheth euen to the spirit of glory that resteth on them, so if men by disorder
grieue the godly minded, they grieue not them alone, but the spirit that is in them, for they are not greeued, but as they are sanctified by the spirit of God. Againe, such as runne to these vngodly spectacles, are  not only disordered persons themselues, and so a griefe to the godly, but as farre as in them is, they maintaine disor∣der and inordinate persons, such are players, who are not ranged into any lawfull calling, and so partake with them in their sinne, as if they had not sinnes more of their owne. Last of all let them remember what the wise man  saith Prouerbs 12.11. hee that followeth the idle is de∣stitute of vnderstanding, and where doe men more as∣sociate themselues with idle and vaine persons, then at stage-playes, they there ioyne with idle and wicked company, and such as by their oathes and blasphemies haue made the land to mourne, as saith the Prophet, Ieremie 23.10. there commonly they linke to euill com∣pany, and euill company corrupts them with ill behaui∣our, and ill company and ill behauiour brings them into a miserable condition, it strips them not onely of wealth, but of all good vnderstanding, and that being gone, they goe on in a sencelesse hardnesse, and see not the iudge∣ments of God ouer their heads. If then wee would not iustly grieue the godly minded, & in them the spirit of God, if we will not make our selues guilty of other mens sins, besides many of our owne, if wee would not iustly be stripped of all good vnderstanding, & so goe on in a sencelesse security, to our vtter destruction, let as many as are guilty of this sinne, repent and reforme themselues, and let vs all in the feare of God, bee admoni∣shed to keepe our feet from running to such vngodly, yea dangerous and damnable exercises. Come wee to the next thing which the Apostle saw among the Colossians (namely their stedfast faith in Christ, the wordes are in the originall, the Solidnesse,
or Stedfastnesse of your Faith. Obserue we heere that the Apostle ioynes these two to∣gether, their good order, & their soundnes of faith, though faith be first in nature, yet good order in life is first seene, and by that did the Apostle gather the soundnesse of their faith; hence we may conclude. That sound faith and well ordered life euer goe toge∣ther,Sound faith & well ordered life euer go together. howsoeuer good order, and holinesse of life, be not (as the Papists teach) the forme of faith, nor concurring as a cause in the act of iustification in Gods sight, yet is there a necessary concurrence, and coniunction of faith, & good life in the person iustified, the Apostle saith, Gal. 5.6. true faith is euer fruitfull, and working by dueties of loue in a mans place and calling, indeed, holinesse of life may bee disioyned from popish (catholike) faith, that being but a bare assent to the history of the gospell, such as is in diuells who beleeue and tremble, but sound and solide faith in Christ for remission of sinnes, and all other blessings, tem∣porall and eternall, cannot choose but shew it selfe in du∣ties of loue, and many good fruits woorthy amendment of life. It is therefore a sophisme, and a deceit of the flesh, hel∣ped forward by the subtilty of the Deuill,It is a deceit of the flesh to thinke that true faith and disordered life may meet together. to thinke that true faith, and disordered life may meete together in one and the same subiect; to think (as the most do) that though they be swaggerers, swearers, &c. yet they haue true faith in Christ; but can true faith in Christ for remission of sins, and many sinnes dwell together? it is not possible, they that so think, neuer felt the power of Gods grace and mer∣cy in Christ, and I dare be bold to tell them, they are yet in their sinnes, whose hearts are possessed with such de∣ceauing thoughts, and know it for a trueth, wee finde it in the worde of trueth, 2. Peter. 1.9. hee that doth not ioyne to his faith, vertue, and with vertue, knowledge: &c. is blind and cannot see farre off, and hath forgotten that hee was purged from his olde sinnes, he doth not remember,
nor thinke on the power of the bloud of Christ, that that is able to wash away the guilt and punishment of his sinnes and to purge out the corruption of sinne, hee that is not purged from the corruption of sinne is not washed from the guiltinesse of sinne. We are further to mark that the Apostle saith not bare∣ly (beholding your faith) but with this addition (your stedfast) or as indeed the words are (the solidnes, soundnes and firmament of your faith.) Hence we may take vp this conclusion. That true faith in Christ is no windy vanity; no empty,  vast, hollow, or hypocriticall semblance or shew, but in what heart soeuer it is wrought, it hath a true, sound, and solid being,True faith in Christ is no windy vanity nor empty shew but hath a true sound & solid being. it is as a solid body, without rottennes, or con∣cauity, without hollownes, or deceit, Hebr. 11.1. it is saide to bee the  (that is) the substance or ground of things hoped for, Heb. 3.14. the beginning or foundation wherewith we are vpholden, Hab. 2.4. this point is made most cleare, by the opposition there made by the Prophet betweene the faith of the iust, and the infidelity of the vn∣iust, the vnbeleefe of the vniust is compared to a swelling bubble, for the words are, hee that swelleth as a bubble, or the vniust that lifteth vp himselfe as a bubble, so as hee seemes as a mighty mountaine, and yet is but as a windy bladder or bubble, his minde is not sound or vpright in him, but the iust shall liue by his faith, his faith bee∣ing no vaine nor empty thing shall vphold him, and mi∣nister patience, and true comfort vnto him, which is a pregnant proofe of this, that true faith is no empty shew, but a sound and solid thing. The reason of this is plaine,  beause true Faith in Christ is a speciall worke of the spirit of God, and therefore it is solide and sound, for all the workes of the spirit are truely, soundly, and substantially wrought; Satan can thrust vpon men the counterfeite,Note. the shew and seeming face of ver∣tue and grace, but not the substance and trueth of any
grace, if grace bee truely wrought in any, it is sound and solide. Happily some, who do not well conceaue the meaning of this conclusion, will desire to be resolued what I meane by a solid faith. This to some may seeme harsh, and hard to bee vnder∣stood, for their satisfaction, let them know that then faith in Christ is saide to be found sound and solid, when those things that are essentiall to faith, and of the nature of faith, as knowledge of Christ, and of his benefites, and appre∣hension and application of the same, concurre and meete close together, that is properly saide to bee a solide body, whose parts are not loose and scattering, as it is in a wooll, or the like, but are neerely conioyned, close and compact together as we see in marble, gold, or such like hard things, so faith in Christ is then indeed a solid faith, when the parts of it, namely knowledge of Christ & of his benefits, and apprehension and application of them, are conioyned, & as it were compact together, when a man doth truly know Christ and his benefites, as he is reuealed vnto him in the word and Sacraments, and doth truly apprehend and ap∣ply the same to his owne Soule, to his iustification, then is his faith a solid faith, & wheresoeuer faith is truly wrought in this sence, it is sound and solid. It may bee some will say, there bee many doubtings in the minds euen of them that truely beleeue, therefore true faith, though truly wrought by the spirit of God, hath in it a hollownesse, and is not sound and solid. To this I answere that doubtings indeede are in the mindes of true beleeuers, and they are and shall be euer troubled with them, but wee must know that doubtings are not of the nature of faith, they arise from our corrupti∣on and infirmity, and doe assault and set vpon faith, but they are not in the nature of it, they doe many times much weaken faith, yet notwithstanding faith may bee still a true, sound, and solide faith, for wee must learne
to marke a diffetence betweene hollow hypocriticall faith and a weake faith, these two are not both one, a weake faith, a faith much lessened in the measure by diffdence and doubtings may be formal, that a sound and solid faith,Note. it being (as ye haue heard) then solid, when there is, thogh weake, yet a true knowledge, and apprehension, and ap∣plication of Christ, and of his benefits, and thus wee see it made cleare, that wheresoeuer true faith is truly wrought, it hath a sound and solid being, the things essential to faith as knowledge, apprehension, and application, they meete close together in such a faith. This doth first discouer vnto vs that popish iustifying  faith is no sound & solid faith,Discouery of Popish iusti∣fying faith to be no sound and solid faith the Papists make it knowne in their doctrine and writings, that they disclaime, and renounce particular apprehension and application of Christ, and of his benefites, they publish it to the world that they hold that to be but an impudent fiction, & what is this, but to let the world see the vnsoundnesse, and dis∣ioynted loosenesse of their faith, and their faith is no better then a loose knowledge, or at the most, a bare assent to the trueth of the articles of our faith, which may bee in very reprobates, yea in the Deuils themselues; true faith (as I haue prooued) is absolutely sound and so∣lide, hauing knowledge, apprehension, and application concurring and meeting close together. Now they disioyn these, one from the other, yea they cry shame vpon parti∣cular application of Christ, and of his benefits, and there∣fore there is no soundnesse nor sauing substance in popish iustifying faith. Againe the doctrine deliuered makes knowne vnto vs,  that the faith of many amongest vs in our Church is no true faith,Discouery of the faith of mny in our Church is no true faith. because the faith of many wants that solide soundnesse that ought to bee in true iustifying faith, for why? may that in any wise bee called true faith that comes farre short of the faith of very Deuills, who be∣leeue and tremble? without question it may not, and
are there not many amongest vs, who neither know that which the Deuill beleeues, nor yet through the hardnesse of their hearts, can tremble at the iudgements of God, as he can, but (to hold vs to the point) doe not the greatest number amongst vs rest in their bare knowledge of Christ and neuer ioyne vnto that knowledge any true apprehen∣sion, and true application of Christ, and of his benefites to themselues? I know wee are prone to thinke well of our selues, our owne corrupt hearts will flatter vs, and tell vs that wee ioyne to our knowledge true apprehension and application of Christ, and of his benefites, and there∣fore haue a sound and solid faith, but let vs ioyne issue and come to the triall. Two things discouer whe∣ther we ioyne to our know∣ledge of Christ and his benefite true apprehension and applicati∣on of them or no.There bee two special things by which wee may truely know whether we ioyne to our knowledge of Christ, and of his benefits true apprehension, and application of them or no. The first is the proper fruites euer following a iustify∣ing faith; I say the proper fruites following it not such as may be common to it with nature, as ciuill life, iust dea∣ling, and the like, which may be in naturall men and vn∣beleeuers, but the proper fruites of it, as an inward loue  of God in his worde of promise, a feare of God in his worde of threatening, a subiection of the heart and life to the will of God reuealed: and a continuall lifting vp of the heart in prayer, and thankesgiuing to God, these are the proper fruites that euermore follow a iustifying Faith. The second is the power of iustifying faith in the time of temptation, that being then as a shield Ephesians 6.16. as a brest-plate, 1. Thessal. 5.8, yea as Saint Iohn saith ex∣cellently well, 1. Iohn 5.4. The victory that ouercom∣meth the world, it being a notable instrument of the ho∣ly ghost, by which wee withstand the lusts of the flesh, the corruption of the world, and the temptations of Satan, and ouercome them, or if wee be ouercome by any temp∣tation,
yet it is (by reason of our faith) with much striuing and reluctation, euen against our best pleasing sinne, by these two things we may trie whether we ioyne to the knowledge of Christ, and of his benefites true apprehen∣sion, and application of them, or no, and if many of vs by these things duely examine our selues, without partiall affection to our selues, we shall find that wee are farre short of a sound and solide faith, where is that man or that wo∣man, who hath true inward loue to God in his worde of promise, and doth truly feare God in his worde of threat∣ning, and hath his heart and life subiect to the will of God reuealed, and doth continually lift vp his heart in prayer, and thanksgiuing to God? and where is that man or wo∣man that feeles the power of faith in time of temptation effectuall to withstand sinne, yea to striue against the best pleasing sinne, and to carry the heart against that sin, which his heart naturally loueth, liketh, and much affecteth? nay who is it almost, that is not carried with the full swinge of his owne heart, and with much pleasure to the commit∣ting of his best beloued sinne? it may be there is in a man sometimes a conflict betweene his conscience and affecti∣on, which indeed may be in natural, and wicked men, but where is he whose heart is carried against the naturall in∣clination of it? for that is a fruit of grace, I leaue it to our owne examination, and this my speech to the blessing of God, and further to bee thought on by our selues, and that wee may bee mooued to ioyne to our knowledge of Christ, and of his benefites, not an hollow but a true ap∣prehension and application of them, which euer receiues strength from Christ, both to accomplish good, and to re∣sist euill; let vs remember that nothing but a sound and solide faith shall stand vs in steed, at the hower of death, or at the great day of the Lord, let a mans outward and ciuill carriage bee neuer so excellent, yea if hee could match the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisies, which for outward shew was without any exception, yet
if hee haue not a righteousnesse exceeding that, euen the righteousnesse of a sound and solid faith, hee can neuer bee saued Mat. 5.20. The next thing we are to marke from the words of the Apostle is, that hee sets out the solidnesse of the faith of the Colossians, together with the obiect of it, (namely) Christ (your stedfast faith in Christ) which phrase cannot with any likelihood at all, bee taken, for giuing credit to the things spoken by, or of Christ, but for iustifying faith. Hence I will but call to minde a point I haue heereto∣fore handled, it is worthy often to be remembred (name∣ly) this. That true iustifying faith is bounded and set on Ie∣sus Christ onely,True iustify∣ing faith is bounded and set on Christ Iesus onely. hee is the proper obiect of it, howso∣euer Faith in a generall sence and reference respecteth the whole worde of God, yet as it is an instrument of iu∣stification, it beholdeth the speciall mercy of God in Ie∣sus Christ, and doth apprehend and apply Christ and his merits. Hence it is called the Faith of Iesus, Romanes 3.26.  and this is carefully to bee obserued, because in this res∣pect onely is faith saide to iustifie,Faith as a ver∣tue or for the dignity either of it sele or of any action of it doth not iu∣stifie. faith doth not iusti∣fie any thing at all as it is a grace wrought in the heart, or for the dignity and worthinesse, either of it selfe, or any other action of it, but onely by relation to Iesus Christ, because it takes stedfast hould of Christ, and doth truely apprehend and apply his perfect righteousnes and merits. The Church of Rome acknowledgeth faith to iustifie, but how? forsooth as an excellent vertue bringing forth mny gratious motions in the heart, as a feare of hell a loue of God, a consideration and desire of life eter∣nall, and so making worthy ex congruo (as they speake) to receiue grace and iustification, which is a doctrine diuellish and dangerous, and flat contrary to the trueth
of the word of God, Rom. 3.27.28. the Apostle opposeth beleeuing, and working, faith, and workes, therefore faith as a worke or vertue doth not iustifie, for then the Apo∣stles opposition were ouerthrowen, then beleeuing and working might stand together, which are made opposite in the act of iustification in Gods sight. Againe, this is to be marked of vs, that faith doth iusti∣fie  onely by relation to Christ, to keepe downe the rebel∣ling pride of our nature,Against the rebelling pride of our nature. it is the pride of our corrupt na∣ture, to looke for iustification, and saluation by something in our selues, if men liue orderly in ciuill fashion, hurt none and doe good to many, then they thinke, they cannot chuse but goe to Heauen, thus doth the Diuell teach them to goe beyond the doctrine of the holy Ghost; hee hath taught that good life and conuersation serues as an eui∣dence, and necessary proofe of faith in the bloud of Christ, by whom wee are iustified, and the Diuell hee teacheth to aduance it higher, euen to shoulder out Gods grace, and the merits of Christ in our iustification, wee must remem∣ber what the Apostle hath taught vs, Gal. 5.4. if wee looke to bee iustified by any thing in our selues, wee are aboli∣shed from Christ, we must therefore in the case of iustifica∣tion, cast from us all confidence in any thing, that is in our selues be it faith, or whatsoeuer it is, iudge our selues, con∣demne our selues, in regard of any thing in vs, and plead nothing but mercy and forgiuenesse, we must goe out of our selues, and fixe our faith vpon Iesus Christ, and be per∣swaded in our hearts, that his death is our ransome, his righteousnesse, our righteousnesse, make him our perfect Sauiour and Redeemer, and build vpon him as a rock that neuer can be shaken.
VER. 6. As yee haue therefore receiued Christ Iesus the Lord, so walke in him. &c. This verse, together with the seauenth, as they haue re∣ference to the generall proposition layd downe verse 3. that in Christ all things needefull to saluation are to bee found, they containe an exhortation to cleaue to Christ, as the onely way to life, the onely root and foundation of all true happinesse and comfort, therefore the Apostle sayth, walke in him, rooted and built in him, and stablished in the faith as ye haue beene taught, &c. but as this 6. verse hath more neere connexion with the verse immediately going before, it is inferred vpon it, as an exhortation to the Co∣lossians, to goe on in Christ as they had begunne, both in faith and in good life, expressed in the words (walke in him) together with the manner how they were to walke in him (namely) as they had receiued Christ Iesus, who is further set out by his title (Lord) and that with an emphasis with addition of the article () the Lord, or that Lord. Interpreta∣tion.Let vs come to examine the words of this verse (as yee haue receiued Christ) (that is) as ye haue beleeued in Christ, for the Apostle hauing spoken of the sound faith of the Colossians in the verse before, he infers vpon it, as ye haue therefore receiued Christ Iesus the Lord, so walke in him, and these two being thus conioyned by the Apostle, wee cannot but vnderstand by receiuing Christ, beleeuing in him. 1. Cor. 15.12. wee finde the taken promiscually, in co, as hauing both one sence and signification, in the first verse it is sayd, the Gospell which ye haue receiued and verse the 2. except ye haue beleeued in vaine, the Apo∣stle makes them of equall sence and signification (the Lord) (that is) the onely true Lord, and perfect Sauiour, by way of distinction, to put difference betweene the true Christ preached by the Apostle, and a false counterfet Christ taught by false teaches, (so walke) (that is) so liue, it is a
knowen phrase of Scripture to put walking for liuing, but with this addition (in him) it implies thus much, that they should goe on in their faith in Christ, and lead their liues by faith in him, and by the motion of his spirit according to his will, for that is to walk in Christ, as to walk in the law and commandements of God, is to frame the life accor∣ding to the preseription of his law and commandements; thus then these words are to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had sayd. As yee haue therefore beleeued in Christ Iesus, that on∣ly true Lord and perfect Sauiour, so goe on in your faith, and liue by your faith in him, by the motion of his spirit ac∣cording to his will. Now from this ver. in generall, in that the Apostle doth exhort the Colossians to goe on in faith as they had be∣gunne, is offered to our consideration this generall con∣clusion. That as we haue begun in any grace, be it faith, the feare  of God, humility, or any other,As we haue begunne in any grace so are we to goe on in the same. so are we to goe on in the same as we grow in yeeres, so are we to grow in grace, the Psalmist saith of such as be planted in the Lords house, they still bring forth fruit in their age Psal. 29.14. and there is reason for it. Because where grace is truely wrought,  it extends it selfe not onely to all the powers of the soule, but to all the parts of the life, and this is a maine difference betweene grace truely wrought and the counterfet shew of it. The one holdeth out and encreaseth, and the other is temporary, and vanishing as the morning dew, as the Pro∣phet speakes, Hos. 6.4. The holy Ghost doth often vrge this vpon vs, that wee are to grow in grace, teaching therehy the necessity of this duty, therefore let no man think much to heare of it often, for I doe but now remember vnto you that which heere∣tofore I haue handled at large, and the rather I recall it to minde, because many are much wanting in this duety, as
men grow in yeeres,  so they grow, not in grace, but in loue and affection to the things of this world,Reproofe of such as grow not n grace as they grow in yeeres. who are more ignorant of the things of God, then commonly some of great yeeres? who are more couetous then they? who are more auerse and backeward to euery good duty, and euery good action? it is needfull then we should after bee put in minde of this, that as we grow in yeeres so we are to grow in grace, therefore to adde something to that which heer∣tofore hath beene sayd to this purpose, let vs first remem∣ber what Solomon sayth, Prou. 16.31. age is a crowne of glory, when it is found in the way of righteousnesse, not when it is begunne, but when it is continued in that way, then it is honourable; what is it then, found in the way of sinne? surely, farre from honourable, it is then base and contemptible, aged persons found ignorant and sinnefull, forfeit and lose the reuerence and respect that should bee giuen them amongst men. Againe, let it bee thought on, that it is a forfeiture and losse of Gods fauour, when aged persons are found in the way of sinne, what they haue beene in times past it skils not, if they haue beene forward in the feare of God heere∣tofore, and now are wholly fallen away, and with Demas embrace this present world, if they haue wholly lost their first loue,2. Tim. 4.10. Coloss. 4.14. zeale, &c, the Lord will take them as hee findes them, Mat. 24.46. that seruant is blessed whom his master at his comming shall finde doing his duty, but as it follow∣eth ver. 48. if that euill seruant shall say in his heart, my ma∣ster doth deferre his comming, his master will take him as he findes him, all the righteousnesse men haue done, shall not be remembred, if the Lord finde them doing wicked∣ly, as appeares plainely, Ezek. 18.24. and indeed it shall stand vp in iudgement against them: if then we would not lose the honour that of right is due from men to old age, if we would not forfeit the fauour of God, & being found by him in the way of sin, encrease the waight of our iudg∣ment, let vs labour to grow in grace as we grow in yeeres,
and as we goe before others in age, so let vs exceede them in the graces of Gods spirit. The next thing we are to marke, is the inference of this verse vpon the former, it depending on the former, as a conclusion, and exhortation grounded vpon it, the Apo∣stle saith, he saw in his Spirit the stedfast faith of the Colos∣sians, and vpon that doth inferre this exhortation, there∣fore as you haue receiued Christ Iesus the Lord so walke in him. First he sheweth they were sound in faith, and then doth wish and exhort them to goe on as they had begun. Hence we may gather. That proceeding and going on in religion must bee  vpon a good ground, and a good beginning,Proceeding and going on in religious must be vpon a good groūd. men are not generally to proceed in religion as they haue begun how soeuer, but hauing begun well and in the truth, then they are to goe on. For why? there may bee a beginning in errour,Note. and to go on in errour being conuinced by euidence of the truth is obstinacy, & if the error be in the foundation of religion, it is heresie, and to go on, yea, to run with speed out of the way, it were better to turne backe, euen zeale it selfe, ear∣nest loue of religion, and of such as are religious, it must be bounded and kept within a right compasse, it must be squa∣red by the rule of the Apostle Gal. 4.18. it is a good thing to loue earnestly alwayes in a good thing &c. this beeing so, the Papists haue no reason to open their mouths,  and to cry out against vs for our separation from them,Our separati∣on from the Papists iusti∣fied. because wee walke not in that religion our forefathers receiued of them, and because we hold not communion with them in their idolatry and superstition for that were to goe on in a wrong way, I know they brand vs with the marke of Heretickes, in forsaking (as they say) the Catholicke so∣ciety, but they are easily answered, that wee haue se∣parated our selues not from the Catholique Church of Christ, but from the malignant Antichristian syna∣gogue
of Rome, and haue gone out of Babylon, as the ho∣ly Ghost hath commanded Reuel. 18.4 that wee should not communicate with her in her sinnes, and so bee parta∣kers of her plagues. Ob. But (say they) do you think all that communicate with the Church of Rome, being (as you say) Babylon, are li∣able to the plagues of Babylon? what say you then to your own forefathers who liued & died in the time of popery? will yet say they were all cast away and condemned? see the cunning of these men to bleare the eyes of the world, and at this doe many weake and simple Christians stum∣ble. I answer them no, we are not so to thinke, that were to step vp into Gods iudgement seat, and to limit the power, and goodnesse of our most powerfull and gracious God, we are to perswade our selues, that at one time or other, & by one way or other, the Lord gaue light, and an holy de∣parture in his truth, to as many as did belong in his electi∣on, euen in the middest of the darknesse of popery, we find it in the booke of God, Melchisedecke, Naaman the Assy∣rian, Cornelius and others, hauing (for any thing we know) small or no means of true knowledge, yet by the working Spirit of a gracious God, were mercifully pulled out of ig∣norance, and worshipped the true God, therefore wee are comfortably to hope of our forefathers liuing in time of ignorance that they found mercy with the Lord, & to this purpose we haue an excellent place, Reuel. 9.4. where it is sayd, it was commanded to the Locusts rising out of the smoke of the pit, that they should not hurt the grasse of the earth, neither any greene thing, neither any tree: but on∣ly those men which haue not the seale of God in their fore∣heads. A sweet testimony of the power and mercy of our most gracious God, who can, and no doubt did, euen when Antichrist was at his height, and in the middest of his Romish Locusts, preserue his chosen from hurt by thē, to their destruction. We see then how we may with com∣fort
answer the cauilling questiō of the popish sort touching the state of our forefathers, we see also our separation from their heretiall synagogue iustified. Heere againe we are to marke the phrase of the Apostle, he sayth not, as ye haue beleeued, but as as ye haue recei∣ued, thus he sets out the nature of ge faith. That true faith it a receiuing of Christ with all his bene∣fits,  True faith is a receiuing of Christ with al his benefits. and this is confirmed by that Ioh. 1.12. As many as receiued him, to them he gaue power to bee the sonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his name, where we see beleeuing and receiuing Christ are made both one; and this is a matter of great comfort to all that truely beleeue in Christ,Comfort to all that truely beleeue in Christ. they by faith doe really receiue Christ,Vse. they doe it not (as the Papists cauill) in meere imagination, but re∣ally they receiue him, and so stand truely and really iust in Gods sight by Christ his righteousnesse, being imputed vn∣to them, and receiued by them, now this comfort the Pa∣pists labour to wrest from vs, and against it they reason thus. If a beeleeuer bee truely and really iust by Christ his righteousnesse imputed and receiued,  then was Christ tru∣ly and really a sinner by our sinnes layd on him, for you will not say, he was a sinner by infusion of sinne, but by sin imputed to him, now (say they) that cannot be, that hee was truely a sinner by sinne imputed vnto him, for hee is not truely a sinner that payes the debt of sinne, an inno∣cent and iust man may doe that, but he is truely a sinner, that either hath sinne truely in him, or is so by imputation strucken, that the sinnes are made his owne really, and he in all respects to bee dealt withall, as if he had sinned him∣selfe, but to say that Christ was so a sinner, is to say, he was auerted from God, the slaue of the Diuell, & sonne of per∣dition, which is blasphemy. I answer,  he is truely a debtour that vndertakes the debt of another, and of his owne accord bindes himselfe to pay the debt, and thus did Christ, he willingly vndertook the
debt of Gods chosen, and so become truely a debtour for them. Againe it is no blasphemy to say that Christ hauing out sinnes on him, was in that respect to God for vs, as euery one of vs is in himselfe to God, they are the words of the Apostle Gal. 3.13, that hee became a curse for vs &c. and so redeemed vs from the curse of the Law, therefore let not the Papists thinke to wring this ground of comfort from vs, that Christ willingly vndertaking to satisfie for our sinnes, became truly a sinner, by our sinnes laid vpon him; and wee againe became truely righteous by his righteous∣nesse receiued by true faith, the comfort of this will neuer faile vs. The next thing we are to marke in this verse is, that the Apostle sayth, the Colossians receiued Christ Iesus (the Lord) adding these words (the Lord) by way of distincti∣on, to put a difference betweene the true and false Christ, for false teachers preached Christ Iesus, onely as the sonne of Dauid, and ioyned Moses vnto him, and made a mixture of the Law and the Gospell, and vrged circumcision as ne∣cessary to saluation, but the true Apostle taught Christ Ie∣sus as the onely true Lord and Sauiour, and so the Colossi∣ans receiued him, hence I gather. That Christ must be taught, and must be receiued with due respect of his glory, as the onely Lord of life, and as a perfect Sauiour,Christ must be taught and receiued as the only Lord of life and as a perfect Sauior or else he is not taught, nor receiued, as he ought to be, wee finde Act. 3.14.15. Saint Peter in his sermon giues him these titles, the holy one, and the iust, the Lord of life whom God hath raised from the dead &c. and that iustly, he being properly, and by nature holy and iust, and making all his members so, and he being the au∣thour and giuer of life and glory, and so is he to bee taught and so to be receiued; Saint Iude in his Epistle verse the 4. saith that certaine intruding deceiuers did deny Christ Iesus, and marke how hee describes him, that onely ruler who is God and our Lord Iesus Christ, for so the words are to be read.
Now this I note to let vs see that the Papists are in this regard blame woorthy,  and iustly to bee taxed they teach and professe Christ to bee a Sauiour,Confutation of the Papists. yet not a perfect Sauiour in himselfe by merit, but a Sauiour in vs, and in∣deede onely an instrument of Saluation, giuing vs grace to merit, our owne Saluation, for they teach that through his merits, God doth poure into euery true Christian a particular iustice or righteousnesse, whereby he is sanctifi∣ed and made able to doe good workes, and to merit eter∣nall life; they be their owne words; and so they derogate & detract much from the glory of Christ, yet they are not or at the least seem not so perswaded, they would make the world beleeue they honor Christ, much more by their do∣ctrine then we do by ours, though we teach that Christ is a perfect Sauiour in himselfe, in regard of merit, and that only our faith doth apprehend and apply his perfect righ∣teousnesse & merit, they plead thus for themselues. Say they,  power giuen to vs throgh the merits of Christ to merit our owne saluation, it is a greater gift then faith to lay hold on his merits to our iustification, it is a greater gift to make vs able to merit our own saluation, then to giue vs faith to apprehend the merit of Christ to our iustification and saluation, and so it doth more magnifie the merit of Christ, for the greater the gift is, the greater is the glory of the giuer, therefore (say they)our doctrine doth more ho∣nour Christ then yours, to this I answer.  First, they must prooue out of the word of God, that such power is giuen thē, which they are neuer able to do, before they make cō∣parison betweene that power & faith. Again I answer thē, it is a greater gift of God to vouchsafe vs eternall life with∣out any desert of ours thē to make vs able to deserue it, it is more for the glory of God, and it doth more magnifie Gods grace and Christ his merits, that wee should haue e∣uerlasting life of the free gift of God, through the merits of Christ apprehended & applied by faith, then of our deser∣uing by his gift, therefore it is a meere cauill and shift
of the Papists, thus to plead for defence of their doctrine and we are to renounce it, as much derogating and detra∣cting from the glory of our onely Lord and perfect Saui∣our Christ Iesus. Come we to the last words of this verse (so walke in him) In that the Apostle doth testifie of the Colossians in the verse before, that they had stedfast faith in Christ, and in this verse, that they had receiued and truly beleeued Chist and vpon this doth exhort them to walke on by their faith we are taught. That a good Christian must not only beleeue in Christ, & by his faith receiue Christ,True belee∣uers must not only beleeue in Christ but must also liue in Christ by faith and by the motiue of the Spirit. & his benefits, for remission of his sinnes, & to his iustification, but his whole life must bee a walking and going on in that faith; a true Christian must not onely beleeue in Christ, but he must also liue in Christ by faith, and by the motion of his Spirit, wee haue this further prooued vnto vs by the example of our Apo∣stle Gal. 2.20. he sayth, that Christ liued in him (that is) by his spirit and in that, that he liued in the flesh, hee liued by faith in the sonne of God, Gal. 3.11. hee makes it generall citing the words of the Prophet, that the iust shall liue by faith, and Rom. the 8.1. hee sayth, such as are in Christ, walke not after the flesh but after the spirit, and indeede as many as beleeue in Christ to their iustification, must also liue in him by faith, and finde him powerfull in them by Spirit, to their sanctification. The poynt no doubt is cleere, for the truth of it; yet hap∣pily some may desire to bee more particularly enformed touching this duty,How wee are to liue by faith in Christ in our generall calling as Christians, & in our particu∣lar places and callings. and may demand how they are to liue by their faith in Christ, the generall being not so easie to be vnderstood; know therefore for our better and more spe∣ciall instruction in this poynt, that our faith in Christ, must shew it selfe powerfull, not onely in our iustification in the sight of God, and in our inward renouation, faith purifying the heart Act. 15.9. which things are not so sensible and easie to bee discerned, but wee are to walke by our faith in
Christ, our faith is to bee working in our outward actions both of religion, and generall calling, as we are Christians, and in the outward actions of our particular places and callings. How is that may some say? I answer,  when faith makes vs doe the workes of our cal∣lings in hearty and sincere obedience to Gods comman∣dements, with diligence and with prayer in quietnes and contentment, referring the successe of our labours to the Lord, when we labour in our callings therein to obey the commandements of God & do our office with diligence, calling on God for a blessing on our labour, and for the issue of our labours we rest our selues vpon the promise of the Lord, Heb. 13.5. I will not faile thee, neither forsake thee, then we walke by faith in the outward workes of our particular callings. Againe, our faith is to shewe it selfe powerfull in our outward crosses and afflictions that befall vs in our bodies or goods,How faith must be pow∣erfull in our outward cros∣ses & afflicti∣ons. wee are then by faith to rely vpon that promise of God, 1. Cor. 10.12. that the Lord will either giue strength to beare them, or deliuerance out of them, and though temporary things faile vs, yet we are by faith to re∣taine hope of mercy and of life eternall, and to wait on the good pleasure of the Lord for our deliuerance, the Prophet sayth; Isa. 28.16. he that beleeueth shall not make haste; thus we see in some part how we are to liue by our faith in Christ, in regard of our outward actions, both of religion and of our particular callings, and in the outward afflicti∣ons of this life. And these things I rather insist in,  which are things more sensible and familiar,Reprofe of them who liue not by faith in Christ that heereby wee may trie our selues whether wee walke in Christ, and liue by faith in him or no, and if by these things wee try our selues, we shall finde that many of vs come short of this duty, for why? doe not most amongst vs spend their dayes in the cares of this world? they care not onely to doe the workes
of thelr callings, which is commendable, but they care for the issue of their labors, which belongs only to God, and these cares, so take vp their hearts, that no good thing can enter into thē, & do not many seem to trust in God so long as it pleaseth him to vouchsafe vnto thē the means of life, & maintenance but if these be taken away then they are confounded in themselues, as if there were no God to care for them; is this a life of faith? no, no, this is to liue by sence, like bruit beasts, this is not to trust God vppon his word and promise, but vpon his pawne, like the distrustfull vsurer, who will not trust a man without some specialty, or some pawne, so if the Lord please to lay downe his pawne as mony, goods, lands &c. and leaue them in our hands, wee trust him; but if these bee taken from vs, wee doubt of his prouidence and goodnesse, and breake out in∣to distemperd speeches, yea, some are so distrustfull of the prouidence of God, that they think when they haue plen∣ty of outward things, if they should bee somewhat liberall towards good vses, then they and theirs might happily be brought to want, see how cunning our owne corruption is to deceiue vs, what is this but to prooue against our selues, that we are not the children of God, for wee know wicked men are tender ouer their owne children, euen beares and lyons prouide for their yoong, shall then the God of all goodnesse wlthdraw his hand from helping his sonnes & daughters, and making supply with interest of that they giue to a good vse, it is not possible, let vs then be better ad∣uised; & that we may be stird vp to this duty now deliue∣red, know wee this for a truth, if our faith bee not in some measure powerfull in all actions and passions of our liues wee yet beleeue not in Christ to our iustification, but wee are yet in our sinnes, and our case as yet is damnable for without question, as many as haue receiued Christ Ie∣sus by faith to their iustification, cannot but feel the power of that faith to their renouation, and in the whole course of their liues; let them as many as hold themselues interessed
in the bloud of Iesus Christ, labour to feele the power of their faith in such things as they may best iudge of it, as in the outward actions of religion, and of their particular pla∣ces & callings & in the outward afflictions that befall thē. When all things in this world, friends and meanes, yea, health and strength faile vs, yet let vs then by faith rest on the promise of God, and certainely hope for mercy and life eternall, that so we may liue by faith, and may also die by faith, and both in life and death finde comfort in this, that we are truly iustified, and within the compasse of Gods speciall loue aod fauour in Iesus Christ. VER. 7. Rooted and built in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye haue beene taught, abounding therin with thankesgiuing. This verse contains an amplification of the maner how the Colossians were to walk in Christ (namely) not only as they had receiued him, but in respect of themselues that they should goe on in him with constancy, and with a set∣tled course, expressed first in those metaphoricell termes (rooted and built in him) and then more plainely, (stablished in the faith) and the Apostle hauing made mention of faith which is a word comprehending many sorts vnder it, sub∣ioynes an explication of it, what faith he meant, (namely) that faith of Christ, which they had beene truely taught, (as ye haue beene taught.) And againe, that they should bee so farre from beeing deficient and failing in the fruites of that faith that they should on the contrary, abound in them, and that with a∣lacrity and cheerefulnesse of minde, set out by the effect of it, (namely) thankesgiuing (abounding therin with thanksgi∣uing) Thus we haue the connexion of this ver. with the for∣mer, & the generall matter contained in it; come wee to the word of it, and first of the words,Interpreta∣tion. Rooted and built in him. These words are metaphoricall and borrowed one
from trees and plants, that as trees and plants not onely grow vpon their roots, but are strong and able to endure the force of windes and weather, according as they are roo∣ted, so the Apostle would haue the Colossians, and all true beleeuers, being engrafted into Christ by saith, and grow∣ing vp as branches frō him, as a root that cānot be loosened to be constant and strong in their faith. The second me∣taphor is taken from houses & buildings, and in substance doth signifie as much as the first, that as houses set vpon a strong foundation, are firme, and stand without falling in the greatest violence of winde or water, so the Apostle would haue true beleeuers being built on Christ the foun∣dation of his Church: or rather in Christ as the Apostle sayth heere, and Ephes. 2. the last ver. (to put a difference betweene earthly and spirituall buildings) a foundation that neuer can be shaken, to be firme and stedfast in Christ and the meaning of the Apostle is this. That they should walke and grow strongly and formely in Christ, so as no temptation or affliction should be able to remooue them from him; euen as trees well and deepely rooted, and as houses set vpon sure, firme and immooue∣able foundations, which neither winde nor weather can ouerturne and throw downe. Now here passing by that doctrine of constancy in faith of which I shall haue more fit occasion to speake when I come to handle the next words, the first thing wee are to marke is, that the Apostle was not content to exhort the Colossians to walke on in Christ, but he addes further roo∣ted and built in him, that they should walk in Christ, as those that are rooted and built in him, hence the Apostle by im∣plication doth  giue vs to vnderstand. That some men seeme to walke in Christ, & yet indeed are not rooted and built in him,Some seeme to walke in Christ and yet are not roo∣ted and built in him. mistake mee not, I say not that some doe truely walke in Christ, and yet are not rooted and built in him, for certainely as many as tru∣ly walke and liue by their faith in Christ, are rooted and
built in him, but I say some seeme to walke in Christ, and yet they are not rooted and built in him, thus much the continuance of the Apostles exhortation in these words doth imply, he adding to his exhortation (walke in Christ) rooted and built in him, doth thereby intend the good of the Colossians, that they should walke in Christ, as those that were rooted and built in him, and withall doth inti∣mate vnto vs, that men may seeme to walke in Christ, and yet not bee rooted and built in him, nor bee able to stand without falling in time of triall, when they shall be tried ei∣ther by cunning deceuers, or open & violent persecutors, some seeme to walke in Christ, & yet they are not able to stand in time of such triall, & this is further prooued vnto vs by the second sort of hearers in the Parable,Mat. 13.20.21 some heare the word, and incontinently receiue it with ioy, and yet haue no root in themselues, & dure but a season, for as soon as tribulation or persecution cōmeth, because of the word, by & by they are offended, yea, temporary beleeuers there spoken of, not only know the word, assent to the truth of it, professe it & reioyce in in it, yea, in the sauing promise without effectuall application, but being pricked forward with desire of praise, profit or some other sinister respect, bring forth some kind of seeming fruits, yet saith our Sa∣uiour they haue no root in themselues, and dure but a sea∣son, they are like corne growing on the house top, and as soone as tribulation or persecution commeth,  because of the word, they are offended and start aside. This being so, it concerneth as many as perswade our selues that we walke in Christ, and liue by faith in him, to looke that our faith bee not a temporary faith, but such a faith as is well rooted and built in Christ, and such as will stand strong and stedfast in time of triall.Such as per∣swade them∣selues they liue by faith in Christ must looke that their faith bee so rooted and built in Christ as in time of triall it will not fail them. Some may say, how shall we know that, how shall wee now (before triall and trouble come vpon vs) know that our faith is so rooted and built in Christ, that in time of triall it will stand fast and not faile vs.
I answere,  wee shall know it by this, if so bee wee finde our selues now able by grace, and by the strength of faith, to withstand strong temptations to sinne, euen such as doe most fit our naturall inclinations, if wee now bee∣ing out of triall, by outward trouble, doe finde our faith a shield as the Apostle calles it, Ephes. 6.15. to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, euen sudden, strong and dangerous temptations, then doubtlesse our owne faith is well rooted, and in time of triall by outward trouble we may bee sure it will not faile vs, but wee shall bee able to stand out, if now in time of outward prosperi∣ty wee bee ledde away to vanity, to pride, to selfe con∣ceipt, or to any other sinne, when triall comes, certain∣ly wee shall fall away, and this is to bee thought on and considered. I am perswaded if men did daily examine themselues, I meane such as haue bin tried by seducement of imposters, and cunning deceiuers, and haue yeelded & fallen away to Brownisme,Note. or Papisme, if they should call themselues to account, they should find that they were neuer a∣ble by the strength of faith to ouercome some known sin, as of pride, of selfe conceit, or the like, and so by the iust iudgement of God haue bin left to themselues, and being so left, haue fallen, and made it manifest, and cleare to the world, that though they seemed to walke in Christ, and haply with great forwardnes, yet (indeede) their faith was neuer rooted and built in him, if then we would be assured that our faith is so rooted in Christ, that in time of triall, ei∣ther by seducement, or open persecution, it will not faile vs, let vs before such trial, labour to find and feele our faith strong to withstand temptation to known sins, if we finde our faith stedfast, and able to stand against the assaults of Satan in time of prosperity, then doubtlesse we shall find it strong and neuer failing in time of triall by outward trou∣ble or any aduersity whatsoeuer. The next thing wee are to obserue from these words is that Christ is compared to a roote and a foundation in
respect of his members, in that the Apostle saith, they must be rooted and built in him, hence we may conclude. That Christ giues both sap and safety to all his mem∣bers,  Christ giues both sap and safety to al his members. there is no danger of any hurt to them that grow by faith in Iesus Christ, the root of the tallest cedar, or stron∣gest oake cannot defend the branches, or the body from hurt, the wind may breake off the branches, the axe may cut downe the body without resistance; but Christ the root of al his members, being all-sufficient, & omnipotent doth minister vnto them as much safety, as sap, so that no storme nor tempest, no force nor weapon, can separate the least of his members from him, nor any way hurt them. Consider wee the reasons of it,  which are chiefly these two. First, Christ doth remoue from his members that which  is the cause of all hurt, and danger, (namely) sinne, he takes away the guiltinesse, and punishment of sinne, by his suf∣fering Rom. 8.1. and the power of it by his grace, therfore what hurt may they feare. Againe, as many as haue Christ for their roote, haue  God his Father for their dresser and keeper, Iohn 15, 1.2. therefore if any thing bee hurtfull in them, hee takes it a∣way; if any thing wanting hee supplies it, if violence bee offered them, hee withstands it, and euen thus the Lord speakes of himselfe, Isay 27.3. sing (saith hee) of the vine∣yard of redde wine, I the Lord doe keepe it, I will water it euery moment least any assayle it, I will keepe it night and day. What then canst thou hurt the Lords vine or any branch of it. Some may say, none are more subiect to miseries,Ob. trou∣bles, and dangers, then they that be the members of Christ, daily experience shewes it. Though they bee so,  yet those miseries that befall them bee not hurtfull vnto them; death it selfe hath lost his sting thorough Christ, and therefore not any other mi∣sery can hurt or molest them that belong to Christ; the
troubles that befall them are testimonies of Gods loue; and not of his anger; would wee then haue our harts at li∣berty, free from dread of all hurt that may befall vs, espe∣cially in the time of some common calamity. We must then draw all our safety from whence we de∣riue our saluation,Wee must draw our safe∣ty from the same root frō whence we deriue our sal∣uation. euen from the Lord Iesus our Sauiour, from our being in him and growing in him, and our com∣munion with him, without this, all the means in the world will not secure vs from hurt, and deliuer vs from plagues, and iudgements, no; Gods owne hand will not comfort vs without respect had to this, that wee are members of Christ, such as bee out of Christ, and vnbeleeuers, haue the wrath of God, his threatnings, his oath, and his hand against them, and what hand or strength can defend them, on the contrary, true beleeuers are so free from danger of any hurt, that though Satan, and his instruments, would yet they can do nothing, that may hurt them, yea I may be bold to say (if I be rightly vnderstood) that God him∣selfe can do nothing to their hurt, because he will not, and so vnderstand my speech of his actuall power, for his will and actuall power, are of equall extent, the one goeth not further then the other, and so I say God himselfe can doe nothing that may hurt them; which is a great comfort to all true beleeuers; let vs therefore labour to draw safely from the same root from whence we deriue our saluation, euen from Iesus Christ our Sauiour, by being ingrafted in∣to him, and rooted in him by faith, and then we shall bee safe, and free from danger of hurt, in the greatest calami∣ties that can be sent amongst vs. Obserue wee further that the Apostle saith, (rooted in Christ, and built in him) and not on Christ, which is a phrase not vsuall in building, giuing vs to vnderstand that true beleeuers are as Peter calls them, 1. Peter 2.5. li∣uing stones, liuing and growing in the foundation: hence I gather. That all the members of Christ are fruitfull branches, &
as liuing stones receauing life; and grace from Christ, their  roote and foundation,The true members of Christ are fruitful bran∣ches, and as li∣uing stones receiue grace and life from him. and therefore it is false which the Papists affirme, that hypocrites and ill liuers may be mem∣bers of Christ, wicked men may be members of the visible Church for a time, and of Christ sacramentally, but not in∣deed, as many as are indeed, and truth, members of Christ receiue sap from him, and bring forth fruits answerable to such a roote. Come wee to those wordes wherein the Apostle doth plainely expresse the meaning of his continued exhortati∣on that the Colossians should go on in faith,  Hypocrites & ill liuers can∣not be true members of Christ. with constan∣cy as they had begunne, hauing set it downe in words me∣taphoricall, wherof we haue spoken, he further propounds it in these plaine termes stablished in the faith, together with an explanation what faith hee meanes (namely) that faith which they had beene taught, as ye haue beene taught) the word (stablished) is not heere metaphoricall, as in cap. 1.13. in the originall wee find two different words,Interpreta∣tion. the word heere is to be taken in the proper signification of it, and is as much as if the Apostle had said, confirmed in the faith, so it is translated 1. Cor. 1.6. as the testimony of Iesus Christ hath beene confirmed in you, the Apostles meaning then is briefly this, confirmed in the faith of Christ, or of the Gospell, all is one in substance, as ye haue bene truly taught by the true teachers of the Gospell. The first thing that is offered from these wordes to bee considered, is the constancy and stability of faith, in that the Apostle truely▪ saith (stablished in the Faith) the point is this. That we are to be setled and confirmed in our know∣ledge, and faith of the Gospell, wee are not to stand in a mammering, not knowing whether our faith be right, or wrong, but we are to be perswaded in our hearts, it is the true faith of Iesus Christ, we hold and professe,We are to bee perswaded in our harts that the faith of Iesus Christ wee hold and professe is the true faith. and to be resolued rather to forgo our liues, then to forsake it, and this is that which the Apostle doth inforce vpon the Co∣rinthians:
1. Cor. 16.13. saith he, stand fast in the faith, &c. and againe Ephes. 4.12.Ephes. 4.12. he saith, it is one speciall vse of the ministery of the Gospell, that Christ ascending vp on high gaue gifts vnto men, some to be Apostles, and some Pro∣phets, and some Euangelists, & some pastors, and teachers for the gathering together of the Saints, for the worke of the ministery, & for the edification of the body of Christ, &c. that we hence-forth should bee no more like children tossed vp and downe altogether in vncertainty, but that we should be setled in all points of religion, we professe, and haue our hearts stablished with grace, as we haue it Hebr. 13.9. the reason and ground of this that our knowledge and faith should be thus setled and stablished, is, because it is knowledge and faith of the Gospell,  the eternall and vn∣changeable word of God, and therefore it must be answe∣rable to such an obiect in some measure of constant and setled stability,  farre be it then from vs (we now by Gods mercy professing the true faith of Iesus Christ) that wee should be so vnsetled (as some are) in the principall points of religion,We are not to be vnsetled in the principall points of reli∣gion as some bee. that euery cauill of any seducer should driue vs from our hold, and make vs doubt whether we go right or wrong, let this be farre from vs to bee so light and wande∣ring. Happily some may say how is it possible, how should we be setled in that we hold, and beleeue, amidst the mul∣tipliclty of opinions, and differences of iudgements, some are Papists, some Protestants, some hold one thing, and some another, how then can we be resolued, it is the truth of God which we in our Church hold and professe? I answer, wouldst thou (indeed amidst the diuersity of opinions, be resolued thou art in the right way, and that the Faith which thou dost hould and professe beeing the faith of this Church is the true faith of Iesus Christ? looke thou that thine heart be vpright in the feare of God, that thou with an honest and good heart, heare, read, and medi∣tate in the worde of God, and endeuour to practise that
which thou knowest, and then thou shalt not bee left to shift for thy selfe, and to roule vp and downe in doubtful∣nes, and vncertainty, for want of direction, but thou shalt then haue a faithfull guide and directer, within thine own breast, thine eares shall heare a voyce behind thee (as saith the Prophet Isay, 30.21. euen the voyce of the spirit of God who is alwaies in them that are vpright and true hearted Christians, saying this is the way, walke in it, for marke what the Lord promiseth to them that faithfully serue him, Psalme. 25.12. What man is hee that feareth the Lorde? him will hee teach the way that hee shall choose. Againe, consider that excellent speech of our Sauiour to this purpose Iohn 7.17. if any man do the will of my Father, he shal know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speake of my selfe;Note. he that is a doer of the will of God in true and sincere obedience, he shall not be left in doubt, but shall be taught the truth by the Spirit of God, and fully resolued of the same, and indeed if men bee left wauering and doubting whether they be in the right way or no, it is because they are laden with sins, and carried a∣way with their owne lusts, and are vtterly void of the feare of God, therefore labour thou to feare God, and to obey his will, according to the measure of knowledge, and thou shalt be guided by the spirit of God, to know the truth, to loue and imbrace the trueth, yea thou shalt haue thine heart so stablished by grace, as that thou shalt bee setled, and fully resolued to liue and die in the trueth held and professed. And that we may be stirred vp to this duty, consider we that the ende of the doctrine of the Gospell is to con∣firme vs, and to make vs certaine of Gods grace in Ie∣sus Christ to make vs reioyce in Gods presence in this world, euen to speake to God in prayer, and to meet him with comfort in his word and Sacraments, and at the day of iudgement, to stand with holdnesse before the throne
of glory. Now this cannot be done so long as we are wa∣uering, and floating vp and downe in vncertainty, Iohn saith, 2. epist. 9. whosoeuer abideth not constant in the doctrine of Christ, he hath not God to be his gratious Fa∣ther, if then wee would not disappoint our selues of the chiefe comfort of the Gospell, let vs neuer rest till wee be so setled, and confirmed in our true knowledge and faith of the Gospell, that no blast of false doctrine, or breath of any seducer, can be able to remoue vs. The next thing we are to marke from these wordes is; that the Apostle doth limit,True faith hath relation to the worde preached. and referre the faith wherein he would haue the Colossians stablished, to the doctrine of the Gospell that had beene taught amongst them, (sta∣blished in the faith as ye haue beene taught &c.) Hence wee may take vp this known conclusion. That true faith hath relation to the word preached, true faith is conceiued and wrought by the publike ministry, and teaching of the word, cal to mind for proofe of this, onely that knowne gradation of the Apostle, Rom. 10.14. How shal they beleeue in him of whom they haue not herd and how shall they heare without a preacher, and the in∣ference vpon that, verse 17. is this, then faith is by hea∣ring, and hearing by the word of God. Now this makes it  cleare that the faith of some, I meane of such as build on visions, and apparitions, and priuate illumination of the Spirit, is but a fancy,Faith built on visions & ap∣paritions and priuate illu∣mination of the spirit is a meere fancy. a meere dotage, and deuice of the de∣uill 2. Cor. 3.8. the Apostle calls his preaching the mini∣stration of the Spirit, giuing vs to vnderstand that the word and spirit are so neerely conioyned, that they must al∣waies go together, the Spirit shineth vnto vs in the word, and the word is powerfull by the Spirit, and wee must bee taught of God, but it must be by the word, and by the mi∣nistery of man, our Sauiour Christ, Iohn 14.26. promi∣seth that his Spirit shall suggest, and bring all things to the minds of his Apostles, and followers, which he had taught them, and not any new doctrines or reuelations; there∣fore
they who rest vpon any reuelations in the matter of Faith, besides the worde, most falsly pretend the Spirit of God. Againe, let this conclusion bee thought on to further  vse, it doth discouer vnto vs, that the faith of many per∣sons is but a meere imagination,The faith of many persons discouered to be but a meer imagination. for why? doe not many say they beleeue their saluation by Christ, and yet liue in continuall neglect, or contempt of the publike ministery of the word, they either come not to the publike exercises of the word, or care not to profit by them. Let such per∣sons know that their faith is indeed but a fancy, and as it is not conceaued by the teaching of the worde, nor built on the word, so in time of triall, it will minister vnto them no comfort from the word, the storehouse of all sound and sauing comfort. One thing more may bee gathered from these wordes, In that the Apostle would haue the Colossians to be sta∣blished in that faith they had beene taught, wee may con∣clude. That wee are to bee as fully perswaded of the trueth of  the worde and promise of God taught by man lawfully called, as if God himselfe should speake vnto vs from hea∣uen,We are to be as fully per∣swaded of the truth of Gods worde & pro∣mise taught by man law∣fully called, as if God him∣selfe should speake vnto vs from heauen. for why? God hath so ordained, it is the ordinance of God that the promises of the Gospell should bee prea∣ched and▪ applied to our soules by the ministery of man, and by vertue of Gods ordinance, the worde and promise truly taught, and applied by a lawfull minister, is as cer∣taine and infallible, as if the Lord should immediately speake from heauen himselfe, and for this very cause saith the Apostle, 1. Thess. 2.1.3. thanke wee God without cea∣sing, that when ye receiued of vs the worde of the prea∣ching of God, ye receiued it, not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the worde of God, which also worketh in you that beleeue, a plaine & pregnant proofe of the point deliuered And this (for the vse of it) may serue to strengthen vs
in faith,  it may comfort and cheere vs vp in time of trou∣ble, or temptation,Strength to our faith and comfort vnto vs in time of trouble and temptation. when wee are conflicting with Satan, and wrestling against despaire, if then it please the Lorde either to bring to our remembrance, the sweet promises of the Gospell, we haue heard deliuered, and applied in the publike ministery, we are to apprehend and to take holde of them, and to be fully perswaded of the truth of them to our comfort, or if it please the Lord at such a time to send vnto vs his minister, to declare vnto vs our righteousnes, as Iob saith cap. 33.23. and to say vnto vs out of the word of God, beleeue, and repent, and Gods mercy belongs vn∣to thee, we are then to be as verily perswaded of the truth of that promise, as if God himselfe should speake vnto vs with his owne immediate voyce from heauen, and so to be comforted and strengthened in our faith, and full assu∣rance of Gods mercy: when Nathan came to Dauid being cast downe to the mouth of hell, (yet his faith not altoge∣ther fayling, and told him in the word of a Prophet, as we read 2. Sam. 12, 13. the Lord hath put away thy sinne, no doubt Dauids hart was much cheered, and comforted, and his soule much strengthned in the assurance of Gods mer∣cy, yea doubtlesse more comforted by Nathans speech, then if all the men in his kingdome, beeing not prophets should haue said as much vnto him, because the promise and blessing belongs properly to the minister in the dis∣charge of his function, when therefore in the like case the minister shall say vnto vs, beleeue and repent, and mercy belongs vnto thee; wee are then to be as thoroughly per∣swaded it is true, as if God himselfe should cal vs by name and say beleeue thou, and repent, and mercy belongs to thee, or say vnto vs; I am thy Father, and thou art my child if thou beleeue and repent. It followeth, abounding therein with thanksgiuing. In these words the Apostle makes knowne to the Co∣lossians, that he would haue them so farre from being de∣ficient in faith, as that they should abound and increase and
grow to greater measure, and that with cheerefulnesse.Interpreta∣tion. For that is briefly the meaning of the words, abounding in that faith ye haue beene taught, with cheerefulnesse, for con∣cluding of the first point hence offered, wee are to marke that the Apostle doth not say abounding in faith generally, and so vrging vppon the Colossians, the ge∣nerall proposition, that they should continually grow in grace, in faith, &c. but hee doth limitte his speech to that faith, they had beene taught, and saith abounding therein. Hence wee may gather that to the doctrine of faith;  hope, loue, or any vertue taught amongst vs, wee are to adde a measure, and a further increase in respect of our selues, wee are not to content our selues with that do∣ctrine of faith, hope, loue, or other grace that is deliue∣uered, and taught, but wee are to adde vnto it, and further to abound in it, in regard of our owne particular measure,To the do∣ctrine of faith or any other grace taught amongst vs we are to adde an increase in respect of our selues in par∣ticular. and vse of that grace. Vnderstanding aright, we are not to adde vnto it any different thing, that were to adde to the word of God, but after the hearing of the doctrine of faith, or any other grace, wee are to gather more vnto our selues in particu∣lar, touching both particular knowledge,Note. and particu∣lar vse of the same, then that wee haue heard deliuered vnto vs; for proofe of this read Matthew 13.23. hee that receiueth the seede of the worde in good ground &c. that I obserue from thence, fitting the point in hand, is this. That good hearers must be like good ground, and good ground (as we know) brings foorth more in haruest, then was cast into it, in seed time, so good hearers receiuing the seede of the worde into honest and good hearts, must send foorth the same seed, but with some increase in res∣pect of themselues, they must adde a measure to that they haue receiued. Thus did Dauid, hee did not content himselfe with that hee had receiued of his teachers, but
but did dayly increase in his particular knowledge, and vse of the things taught, in somuch as hee became wiser, and had more vnderstanding then all his teachers, Psalm. 119.99. thus must wee doe, wee must daily adde to that we are taught a particular knowledge, and vse of it to our selues. The reason of it is this, if it please God to open our eies, to see our spirituall estate, we are best acquainted with our owne condition, and can better, and more particularly apply things taught, for the increase of our knowledge, and the vse of them, then our teachers do, or can do, we must not therfore rest in that we are taught, but adde a measure, and increase vnto it, in respect of our selues, now before I come to vrge this duety, I hold it needfull to shew some speciall meanes, helping forward to the performance of it, which may iustly bee expected, for it may bee saide, wee see it indeede made manifest vnto vs, that wee are to adde a measure and increase to that wee haue beene taught,Meanes hel∣ping vs to ad an increase to that wee haue beene taught are two. but how is that to be done? I answere, the meanes helping to that purpose are many, but especially these two. The first is a serious & carefull meditation vpon things heard, a reuiewing and thinking againe vpon the doctrine of any grace taught and made knowne vnto vs, for as Sa∣tan doth put into the heads of wicked men (they set∣ting their wits to deuise mischiefe) such platformes and deuises as otherwise were wonderfull to come vnto, wit∣nes that of the gunpowder treason. So the spirit of God doth communicate to them that set themselues to medi∣tate on good things heard, with care to profite by them, more heauenly things then they can possibly reach, ei∣ther by hearing, or reading. Hence it is that Dauid saith, hee had more vnderstanding then all his teachers, be∣cause the testimonies of the Lord were his daily medi∣tation. The second meanes helping to the attainement of
more particular knowledge, and vse of things heard, and of the doctrine of any grace deliuered in the publike mi∣nistery, is an expressing of that in our liues, which is made knowne by teaching, and an exercising of that grace wee are taught by the word, as occasion is offered, for by expressing, and by exercise of faith, loue, patience, and other graces, we shall come to more particular knowledge and vse of those graces, then by the doctrine of the best teacher in the worlde, yea by exercise it comes to passe many times, that priuate men are able to speake of faith, and of other graces, with better knowledge and consci∣ence then some preacher, Hebrewes 5.8. it is saide that our Sauiour himselfe learned obedience, by the things which hee suffered, hee exercising obedience in suffering, hee learned obedience, and Romanes 5.4. it is saide that the exercise of patience brings forth experience (marke it) by exercising patience vnder the crosse, we come to such a a particular and experimentall knowledge of our owne weakenesse by nature, and of our strength by grace, and by the assistance of Gods spirit, as we cannot possibly haue by the doctrine of patience. We see then that by serious meditation on things taught & by exercising that grace that is made known vnto vs by the ministry of the word, we may adde a further measure in regard of our particular knowledge,  and vse of the same and this duety is worthy to be thought vpon, the most of vs are defectiue in it,Reproofe of such as are de∣fectiue in this duty. we are so farre from adding any mea∣sure, and abounding in faith or other grace, as that wee retaine not things receiued, but let them slippe and runne out of our mindes, yea it may bee wee neuer thought this to be our duety, to adde any thing to that wee are taught, indeede (as I said) we are not to adde any new thing vnto it of our selues, but yet wee are by good meanes to goe on to a further increase of our particular knowledge,Two motiues to stirre vs vp to this duty. and vse of things taught, and to helpe vs forward in this, consider we these two things.
First, all the grace, and all the faith wee haue, or can reach vnto, is little enough in time of temptation, when there comes a triall of our faith, patience, meekenesse, hu∣mility, or any other grace that is in vs, we shall find, that all we haue is little enough, euen holy Iob, though he had a great measure of patience, yet he found it too little in time of his greatest triall. Againe consider we, that if we rest in that we heare and learne by teaching, and labour not to adde vnto it a par∣ticular knowledge and vse, surely our knowledge may end in ignorance and prophannes, for such knowledge is either conceiued by the strength of naturall vnderstanding, or at the most, it is but a generall illumination, and common to vs with the reprobate, & if we go no further, it must needs faile in the end, & by the iust hand of God fall either into ignorance or prophanenes, our Sauiour saith Math. 13.12. whosoeuer hath not (that is) as appeares by the circum∣stance of the place, hath not more then a generall illumi∣nation, from him shal be taken away, euen that hee hath e∣uen his gifts of nature, as vnderstanding, dexterity of wit, and the like; let it therefore be thought on, that the grea∣test measure of grace is little enough in the time of triall, and if we rest in that we learn by teaching, our knowledge in the end may fall into ignorance or prophannesse. Yea wee may bee left not onely destitute of heauenly graces, but by the iust hand of God, bee stripped and de∣priued of the good gifts of nature. Let vs therefore be stir∣red vp to labour, both by serious meditation on things taught, and by exercise of that grace that is made knowne by the word, to gather more particular knowledge, and vse of faith, or any other grace, then possibly we can come vn∣to, by hearing the best teachers. The next thing hence offered to our consideration, is from the word heere vsed (abounding or exceeding) for the word signifies not, that there can bee any excesse of faith, or any other grace, as the Papists writing on Acts. 17.22.
foolishly define superstition, to bee an excesse of religion, but that we are not to content our selues with a small mea∣sure or mediocrity of faith, but to labor for a plerophory, for store and plenty of Faith? Hence then we see, what is a lawfull desire and seeking  of aboundance (namely this,) wee may lawfully labour and vse all good meanes to abound,We may law∣fully and wee ought to vse al good meanes to increase in faith and in∣ward graces of Gods spirit 1. Cor. 15 58. but wherein? not in wealth and outward things, wee are not to seeke for such things more then necessary for nature and person, but we may lawfully vse all good meanes to increase in faith, and inward graces of Gods spirit, yea it is our duty so to doe, as the Apostle exhorts, 1. Cor. 15. last verse, therefore my be∣loued brethren, be ye stedfast, vnmoueable, aboundant al∣way in the worke of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord; the reason is plaine (namely) this. Because the greatest measure of grace wee can reach in this life, is not more then necessary to saluation,  as the least measure truly wrought may be sufficient, so the greatest measure is not more then sufficient, therefore wee may lawfully, and it is our duty to vse all good meanes to in∣crease in faith, and in the feare of God, and in other gra∣ces a duety neuer more needfull to be vrged then in these daies. Now most men haue their desires and affections set on the world, and greedily hunt after aboundance of riches,  Reproofe of such as gree∣d ly hunt af∣ter the things of this life and haue litle or o care to seek fter spi∣rituall good things. and honours, such as haue plenty are neuer satisfied, such as are poore, esteeme them that haue plenty most happy, and so euery one almost labours to gather riches to himselfe, but not to bee rich in God as our Sauiour speakes, Luke the 12.21. to heape vp, if possibly hee can, though by vnlawfull meanes aboundance of wealth, and riches, but few or none seeke after the true riches and trea∣sures, after aboundance of spirituall gifts and graces which indeed ought to be sought for aboue all the wealth in the world, & to this end we are to disburden our selues of care
and greedy seeking after the things of this life; the thorny cares of this world choake the seed of the word, and make it vnfruitfull, Matthew 13.22. yea such as haue aboun∣dance of riches and outward good things, ought to spend more time, more care and labor in seeking after grace and spirituall things, then they who are in pouerty, and want things needfull, Thus much the Apostle teacheth vs, 1. Cor. 7.21. when he saith to the seruant, if thou maist bee free, vse it rather, such as haue plenty of wealth, haue or may haue more free∣dome to attend on holy exercises,Note. therefore they are to giue more time to attend on the meanes, effectuall for the working and increase of grace in them, and if thou beest poore, yet seeke for aboundance of grace, if thou attaine that, thou art richer then the richest in the world, wanting grace,Two motiues to stir vs vp to labor▪ after plenty of grace. and to stirre vp euery one to labour▪ after plenty of grace, if thou beest rich, consider that thy life standeth not in thy aboundance, as Christ himselfe saith, Luk. 12.15. if thou hast no more care to bee rich in grace; as thou art  rich in outward things, thy iudgement and condemnati∣on shall be the greater in regard of thy riches, if thou bee poore, and hast no care to seeke after grace, (of which sort there be too many) thy pouerty is then a curse vnto thee, and but a beginning of a further woe and misery, and the Lord hath begun to sit in iudgement against thee already. Againe, let vs all, both rich and poore, consider that this one thing (namely) seeking after grace, is absolutely neces∣sary, Maries part Luke 10.42. though the entertaining of Christ was as necessary as any outward businesse, yet it was not necessary in comparison of that one thing, for without this a man cannot be saued, which hee may with∣out any thing else hauing this. Let vs therefore in the feare of God bee stirred vppe, not so greedily to hunt after the things of this life, but to labour and seeke after this one thing, so absolutely necessary to our owne saluation. Let vs neuer rest till by the vse of good meanes, we attaine
to a plentifull measure of grace, and by the spirit of grace bee transformed into the image of Iesus Christ. Come we to the last words (with thanksgiuing) the do∣ctrine offered vnto vs, hence is this. That as wee abound in faith, so are wee to abound in  thankesgiuing to God, or (to deliuer it positiuely) the pro∣position may bee this (the wordes will beare it) as many as abound in faith, they also abound in thankesgiuing to God,As many as a∣bund in faith they abound also in thanks∣giuing to God. it is not possible that any should haue much faith and little thankefulnesse to God for his mercy, the wo∣man in the Gospell beeing assured of much mercy in the forgiuenesse of many sinnes, returned much loue to Christ Luke 7 47. and certainely, if there bee in the heart abun∣dance of faith, a plerophory, and full perswasion of Gods  mercy, it will set the head on worke,We are to ex∣amine our selues tou∣ching the measure of our thanksgi∣uing to God. Ps. 100.16.11. and make a man say with Dauid, what shall I render vnto the Lord for all his benefits towards mee, yea it will make him keepe a conti∣nuall remembrance, with a serious acknowledgement of Gods mercy towards him, and to dedicate and conse∣crate his body and soule, and all that hee hath, to the honour and seruice of almighty God, for that is true  thankesgiuing to God.According to the measure of our thanks¦giuing to God for his mercy in Christ so is the measure of our faith. Let no man then deceiue him∣selfe, but take it for an infallible rule, that according to the measure of our faith, wil euer be the measure of thanks∣giuing. And againe, according to the measure of our thanks∣giuing to God for his mercy in Christ, so is the measure of our faith, and remember withall that if our thankesgi∣uing to God bee not greater for his mercy in Christ,Note. then it is for other blessings vouchsafed, wee haue no faith at all, happily wee can open our mouthes and blesse God for our health, our wealth, and other outward good things, (which is commendable indeed) but if we haue not our hearts more inlarged, if wee cannot more blesse God for the worke of faith in our hearts, by the mini∣stry of his worde, and for his mercy apprehended in Iesus
Christ our hearts are not right within vs, for that is the greatest blessing of God that can bee vouchsafed in this life, and if wee be more thankfull for other blessings then for that, we haue as yet no apprehension of Gods mercy in Christ at all. Examine thy selfe therefore whosoeuer thou art, hast thou no thanksgiuing to God for that excellent gift of faith apprehending the mercy of God in Christ, or lesse thanks∣giuing for that, then for other inferior gifts? certainly then thou hast no faith at all. And againe, hast thou thine heart enlarged, is the ve∣ry ioy of thine heart, and canst thou more delight to blesse God for his mercy apprehended by faith in Christ, then for any other good thing that is a sure argument of a sound faith, yea, that is a greate argument that faith doth inwardly abound in thine heart, and then thou maist iustly reioyce and say, blessed bee God my faith increa∣seth, and I shall certainly goe on daily to a clearer sight of Gods mercy in Iesus Christ, and in the end bee made truely conformable to my head and Sauiour the Lorde Iesus. VER. 8. Beware least there be any man that spoyle you through Philosophy, and vaine deceit, through the traditions of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. In this verse the Apostle returnes againe to that generall proposition. That all things out of Christ in the matter of saluation are meere deceit and vanity; and here he comes to a more particular handling of it, laying before the Colossians the speciall meanes vsed by seducers to deceiue them, and to draw them from Christ, and to thrust, vpon them other things besides Christ, that is the generall matter contained in this verse.
Now this matter is expressed & laid out in these particu∣lars. First in a caueat and premonition forewarning to take heede of seducement; which seducement is set foorth by the nature aed force of it, where it takes place, that it is of a corrupting and spoyling nature, in these words be∣ware least there be any that spoyle you. Secondly, in a speciall mention of some particular means wherby seducers vse to deceiue (namely) these three First, philosophy which is further by way of explication, sayd to be vaine deceit. Secondly the traditions of men. Thirdly the rudiments of the world. Then in the last words of the verse, the Apostle doth op∣pose to all these corruptions, a generall refutation, that these things must needs be false, deceitful and of a spoiling nature, because they draw men from Christ, and from see∣king happinesse and saluation by Christ alone, this is im∣plied in those last words (and not after Christ.) Come we to speake of the Apostles caueat and premo∣nition, together with the first particular meanes of seduce∣ment, vsed by seducers, in these words), Beware least there be any man that spoyle you through philosophy, and vaine deceit. Beware, the original word signifieth see, or look, it is a word proper to the eyes of the body, but heere transferd to the minde; and the meaning of the Apostle is, let there bee in you a vigilant care and diligent heedefulnesse; (spoyle you) this word is metaphoricall, borrowed from theeues and robbers, who come vpon a fold of sheepe, take and binde the sheepe, and carry them away as a prey, and the meaning is, beware least there bee any that cease vppon you by imposture and seducement, and binde you, and carry you away from the true faith of Christ, as a spoyle, as a prey, and a booty; (philosophie) this word properly signifieth loue or study of wisedome, but it is heere put to signifie doctrine fetched from Heathen wise men and from their bookes and writings containing the
knowledge and science of naturall and morall vertues, and least the Apostle should seeme generally to con∣demne all such knowledge, both morall and naturall, hee addes further as a restraint (and vaine deceit) (that is) such doctrine fetched from Philosophers and Heathen wise men, as is a vaine and pernicious seduction, and drawing out of the way, for so the word translated (deceit) signifies euen a drawing out of the way from Christ, & his true do∣ctrine into errors, and in the end to destruction, thus then are these wordes to bee conceiued, as if the Apostle had sayd. Let there be in you a vigilant care and watch∣fulnesse, least there bee any that by imposture do cease vpon you, and carry you away as a prey, or a booty, and that by meanes of some corrupt doctrine deriued and taken from Philosophers, & Heathen wise men, which may seeme to car∣ry a shew of wisdom, but indeed is a vain & per∣nicious drawing out of the way from Christ, to er∣rour, and to destruction. Now from the first word of this verse (beware) wee are taught that heed and circumspection, is needfull, in respect of deceiuers and seducers, wee are to take heed of such as goe about to corrupt our faith, and our religion, and to draw vs into errour,We are to take heed of seducers who seeke to cor∣rupt our faith and religion and to draw vs into errou yea, though wee bee such as are well grounded in the trueth, yet are wee to take heede of se∣ducement and drawing away, the Apostle witnesseth of the Colossians verse 5. that they were stedfast in the faith, yet hee thought it meete to giue them this caueat, beware least there bee any that spoyle you, &c. Hence it is that hee sayth, Phillip. 3.1. it greeued not him to write to them of that Church the same things, for he knew it to bee a sure thing, euen a thing tending to their cōfirmation & strēgth¦ning
against seducers, and then he subioynes a tripled pre∣monition, Beware of dogs, beware of euill workers, beware of the concision: giuing vs thereby to vnderstand, how need∣full it is euen for such as are well instructed, hauing been often taught the same things, to looke about them, to take heed of the deceit of false teachers, for indeed the Lord who hath the ordering, and doth euer order the malice of Satan, for the good of his Church, doth suffer Seducers in the Church, for the exercise of the faith and patience of his chosen, and for the manifestation of such as be sound in the truth. 1. Cor. 11.19. Therefore they that be most sound in the truth, are to bee wary and to take heed of se∣ducement. It were easie further to shew the necessitie of this duty,  but the question may be, how this is to be done, and how we shall take heed of such as seeke to draw vs to error. To this I answere,  that first we must learne to discene and know them. Alas may some say,  how shall we that are illiterate and vnlearned know them? they can transforme themselues into the likenesse of true teachers, as Satan can change his colour, and transforme himsefe into an angell of light, so can his ministers, 2. Cor. 11 14.15. how then shall wee know them? Ans.  I haue heretofore shewed, in a word therefore to recall it, wee shall know them by their proper fruites, I meane by their fruits not as they are Christians, but as they are teachers, that is, by their doctrine, if their do∣ctrine be consonant and agreeable to the written word of God, and grounded on Iesus Christ incarnate, with due respect of his glory, and set before vs spirituall worship of God, agreeable to his nature and will, then is the teacher a true teacher: but if the doctrine either dissent from the word of God, or any thing derogate from the glory of Christ, or vrge vpon vs an outward worship, standing in outward rites and ceremonies, then is the teacher a false
teacher, and hauing found him out so to be, and discoue∣red him, we are in the second place to auoyd him Rom. 16.17▪ I beseech you marke them diligently, which cause di∣uision and offences, contrary to the doctrine ye haue lear-and auoyd them, yea, a false teacher being knowen to vs we are to auoyd the very breath of him,We are to a∣uoyd the very breath of false teachers. we are to giue him no entertainment,  nor receiue him to house nor bid him good speede Ioh. 2. Epist. 10. wee are to admit no confe∣rence, nor speech with him, as some foolishly do, presume on their owne strength; for if wee so doe, wee breake the commandement of God, who hath sayd, receiue not such a man to house, admit no familiar conference with him, & tansgressing the commandement of God, can we haue any assurance of preseruation, that we shall bee kept from hurt by such an one? no certainely, wee passe the bounds God hath set about vs, we are out of the waye, God hath appoynted vs to walke in, and wee can haue no assurance of his protection; let vs therefore labour to discerne and know seducers, and when we know them, let vs bee care∣full to auoid the very breath of them, let vs not suffer them to come neere vs, least so doing we not only confirme them in their sinne but bring our selues within danger of infecti∣on by them: yea, as the Apostle sayth, to be made a prey or a spoyle vnto them, & consequently a prey to the teeth of the Lyon, euen that roaring lyon the Diuell, who wal∣keth about seeking whom he may deuoure. The next thing we haue heere to obserue, is the nature and force of seducement, where it takes place, that it is of a spoyling nature, therefore the Apostle sayth not (Beware least any seduce you) but least any spoile you; the poynt of  tnstruction hence offered, is thi. That where deceiuers, teachers of errour, fasten vpon any person or people, they spoile them,Where false teachers fa∣sten vpon any person or peo∣ple they spoil them. they carry them away from the truth, as the beare, wolfe or lyon carry a∣way their prey which is not able to resist them, 2. Cor. 11. The Apostle painting out the manners of false teachers,
and by way of exprobration, reproouing the Corinthians for suffering them amongst them, sayth thus; yee suffer euen if a man bring you into bondage, if a man deuoure Whence it is cleere that where teachers of errour are suffered, they bring men into bondage, they spoyle and deuoure them. Act. 20.30. the Apostle sayth to the elders of Ephesus, of your owne selues, shall men arise speaking peruerse things, to draw disciples after them; the wordes carry this sence, that false teachers rising vppe amongest them, and speaking peruerse things, should so far preuaile with some, as they should make them (as it were, sweare vnto their opinions, thus indeede did the Arrians the Do∣natists and other heretickes in succeeding times, as might be shewed at large. First, therfore this may serue to make vs cease from mar∣uelling  that some persons who are seduced by deceiuers,We are not to maruell some persons that are draw∣en to error be¦come of ob∣stinate in their error. & drawen away to papisme to brownism or the like, become wilfull & obstinate in their errours; heere is the reason of it, false teachers haue spoiled them, & made a prey of them & hold them so fast, that a good shepheard may happily take out of the mouth of the lyon, two legs, a peece of an care, as the Prophet speakes, Amos 3.12. but the greatest part they will hold without rescue or recouery, yea, lamen∣table experience shews, that where deceiuing Iesuits & po∣pish priests fasten vpon poor silly souls, they cease not only on their minds, in corrupting them with error, but vpon their very willes, so that, talke with them, & you shall find thogh they seem willing to be resolu'd, & to learn the truth yet they will not, but when they hear a reason, which they cānot answer, insteed of yeelding, they say, were such and such heere they could answer you, in this case, they doe as Pharaoh did, Exod. 7.11. who when himselfe could not tell what to say, to so manifest a signe as was wrought by Moses and Aaron, yet he perswaded himselfe his wise men & his enchanters could, and send for them hee will, to see what they can say, rather then yeeld to the worke
of God, and thus doe many seduced persons, when they know not what to answer themselues, yet they thinke that such and such can, and so they continue willfully blinded and hardened in their errours: Let vs not therefore mar∣uell when we see persons seduced, by popish enchanters, hauing beene dealt withall, by such as are able to conuince them, still wilfull and obstinate in their errours, and hating to bee reclaimed, deceiuers haue taken them, and carried them away as a booty, and hold them fast vnder their power, and by their iugglings, haue not onely shut vppe their eyes, that they cannot see the truth, but by the iust iudgement of God, haue bound vp the power of their willes, so as they will not be made to see it when they doe see it. Againe it being so, that where deceiuers fasten on any people or person, they spoile them; let this teach vs not onely to auoyd seducers, but to affect the truth, and to re∣ceiue the truth in loue of the truth,We must not onely auoyd seducers but affect the truth and receiue it in loue of it. for indeed because men receiue not the loue of the truth hence it is as the Apostle hath taught vs, 2. Thess. 2.11. that God sends them strong delusions to beleeue lies, euen such delusions as strongly deceiue them, and strongly hold them, beeing deceiued, for so much the words doe import . That the Lord sends vpon them such errours as not onely preuaile with them, but are powerfull and strong to hold them, hauing erred, so as they haue neither power nor will to winde themselues out, but thinke them∣selues in happy case and right, when they are most wrong, and so goe on stiffe and stubborne against the truth, and a∣gainst their owne good, till they perish and be damned in hell, let this be thought on, and let it stirre vs vp to receiue the truth in loue of the truth, and to testifie our loue to the truth. 1. Meanes.Let vs hate and detest all contrary errour, as Dauid saith he did Psal. 119.104. hauing gotten vnderstanding of the truth, he hated alwayes of falshood.
Come we to the first particular meanes heere set downe whereby seducers vse to prey vppon poore Christians (namely) philosophy and vaine deceit, the Papists in their notes on this place, charge vs to be such as aduance philo∣sophy aboue the due place, and say wee haue no other ar∣gument against the reall presence in the Sacrament of the Lords supper, but such as are borrowed from philosophie, concerning quantity, place, position, dimensions, sight, taste and other straites of reason, which indeed is a meere cauill and standerous imputation, for we haue many other arguments against that carnall presence both out of Scrip∣ture and out of ancient Diuines, and againe, we bring no arguments out of philosophy, but such as haue ground in Scripture, the Scripture teaching that Christ was truely in∣carnate, and had a true body like vnto ours, had all the es∣sentiall properties of a true body, we hence conclude ac∣cording to the rules of philosophy, that his body is visible, circumscribed, locally and present only in on place at one  time the ground of our argument is from Scripture and nor from philosophy thus far we consent with our aduer∣saries, that a doctrin grounded on philosophy is a means of seduction & drawing out of the way from the truth of religion,A doctrine grounded on philosophy is a meanes of drawing out of the way from the truth of religion. that is cleare from these words of the Apostle, & the reason of it is manifest. Because the wisedome of man is blinde in matters of re∣ligion,  as the Apostle saith Rom. 1.22. when the Philoso∣phers, and wise men among the heathen professed them∣selues to be wise in matters of faith and religion, they be∣came fooles; therefore a doctrine grounded on their wri∣tings must needes be a meanes of seduction and drawing away from the truth into error. And this we may easily retort and turne backe vpon the head of our aduersaries especially the schole Diuines amongst them, who ground many doctrines on Philosophy as iustification by inhe∣rent righteousnesse, freedome of will and diuers others. Let the vse of this bee thus much vnto vs, let it teach vs
to looke to the ground of euery doctrine tendred vnto vs that it be grounded on the written word of God the foun∣dation of all true faith and learne we to suspect speeches cloathed in philosophicall habit, vnder them many times lies hid much corruption. Let vs not then receiue things offered vnto vs in that manner hand ouer head but with examination. I deny not all vse of philosophy, there may be good vse of it in diuinity. And I will now briefely shew how farre foorth philoso∣phie is pernicious and hurtfull to religion, and how farre foorth it is not. First therefore know that philosophy & the learning of the heathen is hurtfull to religion, in that it puts downe some things vtterly false and against the word of God as the eternity of this world, that chiefe happinesse is found in ciuill vertue, that vertue is nothing else but a mediocrity or moderation of naturall affection without renouation or change of them by grace and such like. Secondly, it is pernicious to religion, in that such things as haue their truth in philosophy and nature are abused to ouerturne or corrupt some truth in religion, for example, that of nothing, nothing is made; it is true in nature and reason, but it is false in diuinity and religion, that teaching vs that God made all things of nothing, that from a priua∣tion to an habit there is no returne, hath some truth in phi∣losophy, but in religion it holds not true, because from death to life there is a returne, and there shall be a resurre∣ction of the body; that the iustice and righteousnesse by which a man is iust and righteous is formall inherent in himselfe not in another, as wisedome or learning is in him that is wise or learned is true in philosophy, but false in di∣uinity, because the iustice and righteousnesse by which we are iust and righteous in the sight of God, is not inhe∣rent in vs, but it is the righteousnesse of Christ imputed vnto vs, many other instances might be giuen, but these may sufficiently cleere it, that philosophy is dangerous to
religion in that such things as haue truth in philosophie are abused to ouerturne or to corrupt some trueth in re∣ligion. Now on the other side,How philoso∣phy is not hurtfull but rather helpfull to religion. philosophie and the science of naturall things and morall vertues deliuered by Heathen men is not hurtfull to religion in things there truely deli∣uered and vsed as a seruant vnto diuinity, and so as it may be a meanes to further vs in the knowledge of God, and of heauenly things, for certainely the knowledge of naturall things and morall vertues may help in the knowledge of things heauenly & diuine, the Scripture it selfe doth som∣times send vs to the teaching of nature, and of naturall things, 1. Cor. 11.14. saith the Apostle, doth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire, it is a shame vnto him, Christ himselfe sends his followers to the foules of the aire, & to the lillies of the field to learne that excel∣lent point of the prouidence of God, in the preseruation of them; the booke of Iob is full of arguments from things natural to manifest and make knowen the infinite wisdom & power of God, & there is no doubt, but that Moses and Daniel being instructed in the wisdome of the Aegyptians and Caldeans they made good vse of that knowledge, let no man then simply condemne philosophy & all liberall arts & sciences as some foolishly do but so far forth as phi∣losophy puts down things vtterly false, or as the rules of it are abused to ouerthrow or corrupt some truth in religion. Let vs learne to profit by our knowledge of any natu∣rall thing, let our knowledge of a thing naturall,We are to profit by our knowledge of natural things serue as a step to ascend by, to the knowledge and consideration of some things heauenly and spirituall; for example we know that the eye hath a faculty and power of seeing. Let vs thereby be led forward to consider that heere is an eye in heauen that sees more. That in God the creator & maker of the eye, there is a power of seeing all things. Thus did Dauid reason, Ps. 94.9. he that formed the eye shall he not see, he riseth vp from a
consideration of sight giuen to the eye, to consider the all-seeing eye of Gods prouidence; we knowing that there is in man a conscience that doth checke him for notorious knowen sinnes (as it doth if it be not hardened and cast a∣sleepe by custome of sin.) This ought to lead vs a long to consider of a iudgement to come, that there shall be a time when God will bring all to iudgement. Euen our meate, drink & apparell, are to put vs in mind of the necessitie of the foode of our soules, and the inward hablements and cloathing of the soule, yea, the grasse of the field, and the flowers of our gardens flourishing for a time, and then fa∣ding away, are to put vs in minde of the short continuance and fading state of our liues, thus doing wee shall walke in earthly things and haue heauenly mindes, and make a right vse of our philosophy, euen of our contemplation & knowledge of naturall things. Obserue with mee one thing further from these words (namely) this, that the Apostle cals philosophy, the best learning of heathen, thrust vpon men in respect of true cō∣fort & saluation, not only a deceit, but vaine deceit, a vaine thing, such as hath not in it that soundnes of comfort that is happily expected by it, hence we are taught. That the greatest knowledge a man can reach vnto in humane learning if he rest in it, & look for true comfort by it, it will disappoynt him,The greatest knowledge in humane lear∣ning will dis∣appoynt a man if hee looke for true comfort by it. if a man think himselfe happy & lift vp himselfe in regard of his excellent knowledge gotten by his natural wit, & by study of the best humane learning he deceiues himselfe, he shal vanish away in his own specu∣lation, for why? true sauing & lasting comfort is not there to be found, it is only found in the knowledge of the word of God, which is therfore called, and that by way of exclu∣sion shutting out true comfort from any other word, the word of comfort, & the word of life. Hence it is, that the Saints of God haue euer found such delight and sweetnes in the word of God, as they haue preferred it before the sweetest things, & made it the very ioy of their hearts.
The knowledge that men of the best wits, and by the greatest study come to by human learning cannot minister to them any true comfort in time of their outward pres∣sures and in time of their troubles, that lie on their bodies, it can only tell them this or that trouble is to be born with patience, because there is a necessity of the bearing of it, being layd vpon them, there is no remedy but they must beare it, or it may be, it can go thus far, as to tell them that God will haue it so, but their knowledge they haue by hu∣mane learning cannot shew them in that trouble, the good and holy will of God, and the loue of God euen in that trouble & that God is still the same good God vnto them in afflicting of them that he was before he layd that affli∣ction on them, thus far it cannot go, in regard of outward trouble, much lesse can it yeeld true comfort in anguish of soule or perplexity of minde and conscience. Now then this beeing so, that the greatest knowledge  a man can attaine by humane learning will disappoynt him, if he looke for true comfort from it in time of need,Such as take delight in rea∣ding humane histories must moderate their delight. let them as many as take delight (I will not say in reading of vaine and friuolous tales, but in reading true humane hystories of this Kingdome or any other (which I speake not against, it is a commendable thing to read them) but this I say, let such as take pleasure and delight in reading of them, learne to moderate their delight, and let them take heed they be not carried away with too much delight in reading of them, it is the corruption of our nature, to be too much tickled with delight, & to place a felicity in rea∣ding such hystories, and so to spend all the time wee haue to spare in reading of them, but let vs learne thus to thinke with our selues, will the knowledge I get by reading those stories stay mee in the day of my trouble? will it comfort me in the houre of my death? then it is a sure thing, then is it comfortable indeede, but if vpon due consideration wee find it to be vaine and empty of all such comfort, and that if we rest vpon it, we wait vpon a lying vanity and forsake
our owne mercy as the Prophet speakes Ionah 2.1. Then let vs take lesse delight in turning ouer such bookes & see∣king after such knowledge, and let vs labour to haue our hearts possessed with greater delight in reading of Gods book which is the volume of true comfort, & will furnish vs with such comfort as wil stand by vs in all times of trou∣ble & distresse either of body or mind both in life & death Againe, it being so, that the greatest knowledge a man of excellent wit & with great study hath gotten out of hu∣mane writers,There is no true comfort to be found in naturall knowledge. euen out of morall philosophy which seems to teach the way to true happines is not able to yeeld him any dram of true comfort in time of trouble, what comfort then can such persons finde as rest in their naturall know∣ledge I meane in that knowledge they haue only by their mother wit, some persons will freely confesse they are not book-learned, and indeed they haue not any iot either of humane or diuine knowledge which they ought to haue, & might haue had by the means long continued amongst them they know not the distinction of the persons in the trinity, or at least cannot distinctly tell what any of them hath done for them, they are not acquainted with the pro∣perties of God nor with his actions, they know not his truth, his iustice, his power, his mercy, & other his attri∣butes as they are made known in his word, happily they know them as they may be known by the light of reason, & so did the Heathen, as the Apostle witnesseth, but alasse that is a comfortles knowledge seruing only to leaue them without excuse, let such as blesse themselues in their natu∣rall knowledge, such as content themselues to know God & the things of God as they may be knowen by a naturall man, let them consider that when trouble comes vppon them, they shall be left destitute & voyd of comfort espe∣cially when trouble of minde comes, they shall then haue nothing to oppose to the accusatiō of a guilty conscience, nothing to the burning wrath and fearefull displeasure of God, but shall ly open to feare, trembling & desparation
to voluntary death, yea, to lay violent hands vpon them∣selues. Let these things bee thought on, and let them stirre vs vp not to rest in such knowledge of God and the things of God, as we haue by the light of nature, which is comfort∣lesse, and will then disappoynt vs of comfort, when wee haue most neede of it, but let vs labour for that knowe∣ledge which is offered and may bee had from the word of God, which will be sure to affoord vs true and sound com∣fort, euen in the greatest conflict of minde and conscience that can befall vs. Come we to the second meanes vsed by seducers to de∣ceiue  (n) the traditions of men, through philosophy and vaine deceit through the traditions of men, by traditions, &c.Interpreta∣tion. The Apostle in this place meanes such doctrine, rules or pre∣cepts as were meerely deuised by men either contrary or  beside the written word of God, in the case of religion,Doctrines meerly inuen∣ted by men spoyle such as embrace thē. we may find Mat. 15.9. that traditions are called mens pre∣cepts or rules, meerly inuented by men, & ver. 3. such as crosse & thwart the commandements of God, such as be contrary, or at lest besides the written word of God, hence then doth the Apostle giue vs this conclusion. That such doctrines in the case of religion are as meere inuentions of men hauing no ground in the written word of God, they spoyle such as embrace them, and drawe them away from the truth into errour, the reason  is plaine. because The written word of God is a perfect rule both of faith & maners, & contains all things needfull to be known, be∣leeued or practised, it is suffiiently able to make vs wise to saluation these things are written,Ioh. 20.31. that ye might beleeue that Iesus is the Christ the son of God, & that in beleeuing yee might haue life through his name, and the Apostle saith,Rom. 15.4. whatsoeuer things were written aforetime were writ∣ten for our learning, that we through patience & comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope: therefore any doctrin
added to the doctrine of the word, it being so absolute in it selfe,  must needes bee a drawing away from the trueth into errour,Confutation of popish vn∣written tradi∣tions. now such are the vnwritten traditions of the Papists, their doctrine touchng their masses, trentalles, dirges, halfe communions, inuocation of Saints, adorati∣on of images, hallowing of bread, water, oyle, crossings, ceremonies & many more of that stamp, they are all meer inuentions of men, and such as embrace them, are drawen from the truth to errour; but the Papists plead and say, these things are not so to bee taxed as meee inuentions of men. Ob.Because (say they) they were not ordained by meere humane power, but by Christ his warrant and authority, by such as are placed ouer his Church, of whom he sayth, hee that heareth you heareth mee, and hee that despiseth you despiseh mee, they are appointed by the holy Ghost ioyning with their Pastors in the regiment of the Church this is their colour they set vpon them, but to take from them this shift. First, they are neuer able to prooue that their teachers haue Apostolicall power and authority, the same that the Apostles had, and that they are simply to be beleeued in that they teach, that is a priueledge & prerogatiue belon∣ging only to the Apostles, the planters and founders of the Church of the new Testament. Againe, it is true indeede, Christ saith, he that heareth you heareth mee &c. but how? so long as they teach no∣thing but that Christ hath taught; hee doth not assure vs, whosoeuer heareth man being called to teach, heareth him simply whatsoeuer he teach, but so long as man prea∣cheth Gods word and that appeares Ioh. 14.26. the com∣forter which is the holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name hee shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I haue told you Christ there promiseth that his spirit shall suggest to the minds of his disciples all things, which he had taught them, and not
any new doctrines, therefore the Church of Rome cannot free their vnwritten verities from being found meere hu∣mane inuentions, and we are to auoyd them as things that will spoyle and draw vs away from the truth into error, & embrace only such doctrines, as are grounded on the writ∣ten word of God, which is perfectly able to make vs wise to saluation. Now to the third meanes vsed by seducers to deceiue  (namely) the rudiments of the world, according to the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. These words if they be considered with the former they haue respect vnto them on this manner, that the traditions of men were according to the rudiments of the world ac∣cording to the rites of the ceremoniall law so indeed were the traditions and rules of Pharisies touching washing of cups and platters and the like, but these words besides the relation do imply that the rudimēts of the world are hurt∣full, and so I make them a third meanes vsed by seducers to deceiue. Now the word translated Rudiments doth properly sig∣nifie elements, and by rudiments or elements,Interpreta∣tion. wee are to vnderstand the legall doctrine of Moses in the old Testa∣ment, the rules and precepts giuen by Moses touching cir∣cumcision Iewish sacrifices, and concerning many rites & ceremonies among the Iewes as the eating of certain meats and abstaining from other, the obseruation of daies and times, wearing of this or that kinde of garment. Now these legall precepts and rules are called by the Apostle, rudiments or elements by way of similitude, either allu∣ding to the foure elements of the world, fire, aire, earth & water, whereof all perfect bodies vnder the heauens are compounded or rather indeed, to the first elements of the instruction of chden to the letters the A. B. C. or pri∣mar, wherein little children are first instructed and thence led forward to the exercise and study of more excellent learning such were the legall precepts touching circumci∣sion,
Iewish sacrifices and the rites among the Iewes they were but as the A. B. C. the first letters wherein the Iewes were trained vp as children for a time till the comming of Christ. At which time was reuealed both to them and the whole world a more excellent doctrin, and that this is the allusion of the Apostle appeares plainely, Gal 4.3. where speaking of himselfe and all the Iewes vnder the law, hee sayth, when we were children, we were in bondage vnder the rudiments of the world. Againe these legall precepts are sayd to be rudiments or elements of the world, because they were concerning out¦ward and visible things. Thus then are wee to conceiue these words of the Apostle, According to the rudiments of the world, as if hee had sayd, according to the pre∣cepts and rules giuen by Moses touching circumcision, Iewish sacrificies, and many outward rites among the Iewes which were but as a Paedagogie or an A. B. C. to instruct the Iews only for a time, till the cōming of Christ at which time was reuealed a full and more plentifull do∣ctrine. The law of ceremonies g uen by Mo∣ses is in some case pernici∣ous to Gods people.Now heere first let it bee considered of vs, that these wordes of the Apostle doe implie that the legall rules and precept giuen by Moses teaching circumcision, Iewish sacrifices and and seruices vnder the Law may be a means to spoyle people or persons, and to drawe them from the truth of religion and from Christ to perdition, therefore the Apostle giues warning to the Colossians to beware least any spoile them, not onely by the rules of philoso∣phy and traditions of men, but through the rudiments of the world, through the paedagogie and childish elements of the ceremoniall law these being as pernicious and dan∣gerous as the other. Now it may bee demanded how the rule, and pre∣cepts, and the Lawe and ceremonies giuen by Moses be∣ing part of the written word of God should bee dange∣rous.
I answe e,  when things there prescribed are thrust vpon men as things of necessary vse and obseruation as needfull to bee obserued, together with faith in Christ, and that ap∣peares both by the context and discourse of this place, and by other places of Scripture, Galat. 5.2. saith the Apostle; behold, I Paul say vnto you, that if yee bee circumcised, Christ shall profit ye nothing. It is a speech full of power, wherein the Apostle sets his authority giuen him by Iesus Christ, against the authority of all that teach the contrary, whosoeuer they be. Behold I Paul who am an Apostle, and haue authority to publish the Gospell, say vnto you, who∣soeuer sayth to the contrary, if ye bee circumcised, if yee thinke circumcision of necessary vse with faith in Christ, in the matter of iustification, (for that is the argument there handled by the Apostle) I tell you Christ shall profit you nothing, you shall haue no benefit nor comforte by his death, passion, resurrection or any thing he hath done; a plaine proofe of this, that the Law of ceremonies giuen by Moses, is hurtfull and pernicious, when things there prescribed are vrged, as things of necessary vse to saluation together with faith in Christ. And the reason  of this is, because things there comman∣ded are abrogated and taken away by the comming of Christ, not in respect of signification and Scripture, for they may still instruct vs concerning Christ, but in regard of vse and obseruation, therefore to hold and vse them as things of necessary vse, together with faith in Christ, is a meanes to make Christ vnprofitable vnto vs,  yea to draw vs from Christ to perdition. The knowledge of this point may thus profit, not onely to let vs see that wee are free from the obseruation of Iewish ceremonies, and that there is an abrogation of them, but it may fur∣ther serue to discouer vno vs that the holy things of God, such things as haue full ground in the worde of God, yea things of diuine institution, beeing extended beyond their right vse, they become pernitiousHoly things of God euen things of di∣une instituti∣on beeing ex∣tended beyōd their right vse become per∣nicious. and hurt∣full,
yea meanes to carry vs away, as a pray from Christ to euerlasting destruction; thus the Sacraments which God hath ordained to be signes and seales of his couenant of grace, if they be reached out as they are by the Papists to further vse as to bee Physicall causes of grace to bee things that containe and giue grace to the receiuers by the very act and work of receiuing they become dangerous things, and in stead of ministring comfort they become meanes to make Christ the fountaine of all comfort vnprofitable vnto vs. I might yet further insist in the fruits and works of the spirit, as prayer, Almes-deedes and such like, yea faith it selfe extended further then to bee an instrument appre∣hending Gods mercy, and the merit of Christ to iustifica∣tion, to be a meritorious and deseruing cause of iustifica∣tion and saluation becomes dangerous and deadly, and this is carefully to be obserued of vs, for it is a subtilty of the Deuill, when hee cannot make men lightly to esteeme the holy things of God,Note. and to vse them for fashion or custome, then to bee tempering with them on the other hand to make them to extend them to further vse then God hath appointed, thus he dealt with Christ our head in his temptations, as appeares Matth. 4. by conference of the third and sixth verses, when hee could not weaken his faith in the prouidence of God, and make him distrust, then he laboured with him to extend his trust in the act of it too farre, euen to presume on the prouidence of God, and to neglect the meanes, thus no doubt hee will bee dealing with the members of Christ, wee must therefore labour to know and discerne the right vse of all holy things of God and to take heede that the Deuill or his instruments preuaile not with vs to extend them beyond the same for so doing we do not only abuse the holy things themselues, and make them vnprofitable vnto vs, but they become meanes to spoyle vs, to draw vs from Christ and make his death and bloudshedding, his resurrection, his victory o∣uer
sinne, death, and the Deuill, vtterly void vnto vs, and yeelding no profit nor comfort vnto vs at all. We are fur∣ther to marke, that the Apostle calls the legall doctrine of Moses rudiments or elements, or the a b c, of the law, and that in respect of the more full and perfect doctrine after∣ward reuealed in time of the Gospell, hence we may take out this conclusion. That the teaching vnder the Law was nothing so  excellent as the teaching vnder the Gospell,The teaching vnder the law was nothing so excellent as the teaching vnder the Gospell. they that liued in time of the Law were but as young schollers in some petty schoole, we that now liue vnder the new testa∣ment, are as students of some famous vniuersity, wee by the teaching of the Gospell are led forward to more excel∣lent learning, and more is reuealed to vs, then to them that liued in time of the old testament, and this is cleare by ma∣ny places of Scripture, wee finde it to bee one maine diffe∣rence betweene the Law and the Gospell, that the Gos∣pell is a farre more excellent and glorious light then the Law, 2. Corinth. 3. from the sixth verse to the end, the A∣postle doth preferre the excellency of the teaching of the Gospell, before the doctrine of the Law in many res∣pects. But happily some wil obiect and say this seems not true for Abraham and the Prophets had more reuealed vnto them, then the best of vs,  yea then the best that haue liued since the comming of Christ in the flesh, excepting the A∣postles who were immediately taught by Christ, therefore they were not abcedaries or young schollers in respect of vs? To this I answer it is true indeed,  if wee compare person with person, as Abraham with some one now or heereto∣fore liuing since the comming of Christ. Abraham is not a child in respect of such an one, but if we compare church with Church, the Christian Church vnder the new testa∣ment with the Church of the Iewes vnder the Law, wee shall find that the Christian Church doth farre exceed the
Iewes in respect of reuelation and excellent knowledge, hence it is that our Sauiour saith, Luke 10.24. that many kings and Prophets desired to see the things manifested by his comming and saw them not, and the Apostle, 1. Pet, 1.11.12. saith, that the Prophets enquired and searched, when or what time the spirite which testified before of Christ, which was in them should declare the sufferings that should come vnto Christ, and the glory that should follow, vnto whom it was reuealed, that not vnto, &c. This then remaines a true conclusion, that the teaching vnder the Law was not so excellent as the teaching vnder the Gospell, they that liued in time of the law were but as petties and young Schollers in respect of vs that liue vn∣der the Gospell. Now then is the teaching vnder the Gos∣pell more excellent then the teaching vnder the Law? is more now reuealed to vs by the Gospell then to the fathers of the olde testament in time of the Law? then certainely our knowledge must be answerable,  we must exceed them in the knowledge of the mysteries of Iesus Christ,Our know∣ledge of the mysteries of the Gospell must exceede theirs that li∣ued in time of the old testa∣ment. the rule is generall, to whome much is committed, of him much shal be required according to the means vouchsafed, so shal be our account returned, ignorance now in the cleare light of the Gospell is a most heauy and fearefull sinne, it might in some sort excuse them that liued vnder the Law, but now it is inexcusable, now it leaues men voyde of excuse, ignorant persons haue now nothing to pleade for them∣selues, and that the vgly shape of this sinne may further appeare vnto vs, consider wee that ignorance now in time of the Gospell, it is an argument of hardnesse of heart, we know that a thing that is often exposed, and set before the bright shining of the sunne, and neither changed nor mol∣lified is of a stony nature, so surely such as liue in the bright beames of the Gospell; and are neither bettered nor mollified by them, are of a most stony temper, yea igno∣rance now doth not onely argue this hardnesse, but it is more then a probable signe of euerlasting perdition, so
saith the Apostle, 2. Corinth. 4.3. If the Gospell be hidde if the glorious light of the Gospell doe not enlighten vs, but wee continue ignorant of it, it seales vp a fearefull conclusion against vs, that we are such as are appointed to euerlasting destruction, especially if wee bee wilfully ig∣norant as many are, who in respect of time and meanes might haue beene teachers as the author to the Hebrewes saith, cap. 5.12. and yet had need to bee taught the first principles of christian religion, they are behind the Iewes they know not their letters the rudiments and first princi∣ples of the worde of God, and can they looke to be saued? certainely no, continuing in that state they cannot, their state is worse then theirs of Sodome and Gomorrha, it is the sentence of Christ himselfe, Matthew 10.15. Let it then stirre them vp to vse all good meanes to come out of their blindnes and ignorance, yea let such of vs as haue the greatest measure of knowledge learne in respect of the cleare light of the Gospell to bewaile the remnants of ig∣norance that be in vs and be carefull daily more and more to increase in knowledge, that we may bee answerable to our meanes and condition. Come wee to the last words of this verse (and not after Christ.) These words are apposed to the three meanes of seduce∣ment before specified as a generall refutation of them all, and the meaning is briefly this. That they are not according to the doctrine of Christ in the Gospell, the point of instruction that ariseth hence  is this.This ought to preuaile with vs to renoūce euery corrup∣tion both of life & doctrin that is not according to the doctrine of the Gospel. That it ought euer to bee a probable and sufficient rea∣son to sway with vs against any corruption either of life or doctrine, that it is not after Christ, and that it is not according to the doctrine of the Gospell, Eph. 4.20. the Apostle doth vse this as a speciall argument against the corruptions and manners of the Gentiles to disswade the Ephesians now conuerted not to follow their fashions
he saith that they had not so learned Christ meaning that such things were not sutable to the doctrine of Christ, and therefore to be auoyded, and this manner of reasoning we are to vse. When wee are assaulted by Satan and tempted to any corruption and sinne,When Satan tempteth vs to any cor∣ruption and sinne we are to vse this kind of reaso∣ning. wee are to thinke and say with our selues, surely this is not according to Christ, and if we haue truely learned Christ, it will be a notable meanes to auoid it, and especially this manner of reasoning is to bee vsed in time of some grieuous conflict of conscience, when the conscience wrestleth with despaire, when the law accuseth, terrifieth and threatneth the wrath of God, then will the Deuill set Christ before vs as an angry iudge, saying vn∣to vs on this manner, this thou oughtest to haue done, and thou hast not done it, know therfore that I will take ven∣geance on thee, wee are then to remember that this is not according to the doctrine of the Gospell. Christ dooth not speake there on this manner to poore affli∣cted consciences, hee addes not affliction to the afflicted, hee breakes not a bruised reede, but vnto poore afflicted consciences, labouring vnder the burden of sinne, and Christ himselfe in the Gospell speakes most louingly and comfortably, and saith, Come vnto mee all yee that are weary and laden, and I will ease you, Matthew 11.28. Bee of good comfort my sonne, thy sinnes bee forgiuen thee. Matthew 9.2. bee not afraide, I haue ouercome the world, Iohn 16.33. we are therefore thus to reason in time of conflict of conscience, and if we be able thus to doe, it will bee a notable comfort and refreshing vnto vs in the greatest conflict that can be.
VER. 9. For in him dwelleth all the fulnesse of the God∣head bodily. This verse dependeth on the former as a reason to proue that Philosophy, the traditions of men, the rudiments of the world, and all other things are meere deceipt and va∣nity, and altogether needlesse in the matter of saluation, and that all things needfull to saluation are to be found in Christ, the reason is taken from the sufficiency and perfe∣ction of Christ, that in him is all perfection and sufficiency to saluation to bee found, therefore all other things are needlesse, now this sufficiency and perfection found in Christ is propounded in this verse, and applied to the Co∣lossians in the next, and it is not barely propounded in this verse, but laide downe in the proofe of it, and that from the condition of the person of Christ, that Christ is both perfect God and perfect man, vnited into one person, and therefore most perfect and all sufficient to saluation, that is the respect that these wordes haue to the former and the summe of them (in him) that is, in Christ (the Godhead) (that is) the very diuine essence and nature,Interpreta∣tion. not onely the grace of God, but the very God of grace himselfe, the A∣postle addes further the fulnesse of the godhead, thereby signifying the full and perfect Godhead, the perfect sub∣stance, nature, and essence of the godhead, and yet fur∣ther he saith (all) his meaning in that enlargement is this, that the whole perfect essence of the Godhead is in Christ not onely perfect wisedome, perfect power, perfect iu∣stice, perfect mercy, &c. but that the perfection and ful∣nesse of all these together, and of euery essentiall proper∣ty of the godhead is in him, yea that the same whole glory and maiesty of the godhead that is in God the Father is in Iesus Christ his sonne (dwelleth) (that is) abi∣deth and continueth vnited for euer, the Apostle speaking in the present time signifieth a continuall residence and a∣bode
(bodily) this worde bodily is heere vsed after the Greeke phrase, the phrase of the Grecians, who vse to put  that signifieth a body, to signifie not onely a thing that hath a true being, as a body hath but a person, & wee in our English tongue vse the word (body) for a person, as some body, or no body, we vse to say for some person, or no person; the meaning then of the Apostle in saying (bo∣dily is essentially and personally vnited to his manhood, that there is a true vnion of the godhead and manhood in Christ, that they are made one person, and so the essence of the Godhead in Christ, being in it selfe incorporeall, is after a sort by personall vnion become corporate, they are the wordes of the holy Ghost, Iohn 1.14. the worde was made flesh, the eternall word the sonne of God, the second person in Trinity was incarnate and made man, thus then are we to vnderstand this sentence of the Apostle, as if hee had said. For in Christ the whole most perfect essence and substance of the Godhead abideth for euer, vnited truely and perso∣nally to his man-hood, so as God and man in Christ make one person. In this verse thus laid open and conceaued are found most excellent poynts of doctrine, and before I come to speake of the particular things contained in it, wee are briefly to obserue and marke the argument of the Apostle, whereby he proues that al sufficiency to saluation is found in Christ, and no where else taken from the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelling in him, for thus reasoneth the Apostle, Christ is true and perfect God as well as man, and there∣fore a perfect mediatour, and all sufficiency to saluation  is found in him onely. Hence wee may gather this point of doctrine. That the ground of all sufficiency in Christ, is his god∣head,The ground of al sufficien∣cy in Christ is his godhead. the godhead of Christ is that which makes him a
most sufficient redeemer and Sauiour, for indeed, hence it is that his bloud is so precious, that the shedding of it is satisfactory and meritorious, able by the merit of it to purge, cleanse, and wash vs from sinne as Saint Iohn saith, 1. Iohn. 1.7. the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne cleanseth vs from all sinne; wee are to marke his speech, hee saith, the bloud of Iesus Christ the sonne of God is that which clen∣seth vs from all sinne, and hence it is euen from the God∣head that the flesh of Christ though it profit nothing in it selfe, yet by vertue which it receaueth from the God∣head to which it is ioyned by personal vnion it is the bread of life, and a quickning flesh, Iohn 6.58. yea hence it is that Christ his righteousnesse, his perfect fulfilling of the Law is auaileable for righteousnesse, to euery true beleeuer, be∣cause hee is God as well as man, and so not bound to ful∣fill the Law for himselfe, but of his owne accord hee be∣came the end and perfection of the Law, and fulfilled it for righteousnesse to euery one that beleeueth. Rom. 10.4. this doctrine is to be thought vpon. And for the vse of it,  it may serue to answere & silence the reasoning of the flesh against the sufficiency of Christ,Strength a∣gainst the rea∣soning of the flesh touching the sufficiency of the death and suffering of Christ. his death and suffering, for our owne corrupt reason will teach vs to argue against the sufficiency of Christ, his death after this manner; Christ his suffering was but for a time, and we by our sinnes deserue eternall death and pu∣nishment in hell for euer, how then can Christ his tempo∣rary suffering answer and satisfie for our deserued eternall punishment, between that which is finite, in respect of time and that which is infinite in continuance, between tempo∣rary and endlesse, there is no proportion? for answering of this cauill of the flesh; the doctrine now deliuered may helpe vs, and we are to remember it, in the hower of temp∣tation, we may haue need to remember it, therefore let vs thinke on it now before the triall come, that the ground of all sufficiency in Christ is his Godhead, & therefore we are not esteeme the merit of his death by the time of his suffe∣rings
but by the person who suffered, that Christ who suffe∣red was both God & man, vnited in one person, & by ver∣tue of his godhead gaue power to his death to be meritori∣ous, and of infinite price & value, and hence the Church is said to be purchased with the bloud of God. Act. 20.28. & 1. Cor. 2 8. that the Lord of glory was crucified; the mea∣ning of those places is not, that God suffered or shed bloud he being impassible, and hauing no bloud to shed, but they doe note out vnto vs the infinite merit and sufficiency of Christ his death in respect of his godhead, that the person suffering beeing not a meere man but God and man, his death was made infinitely sufficient and effectuall by ver∣tue of his Godhead personally vnited to his manhood, and so was a sufficient satisfaction for the sinnes of the whole world, and so I come to the particular things offered vnto vs in this verse, and first we are hence to take knowledge of the perfect deity and godhead of Christ, in that the Apo∣stle saith, all fulnesse of the godhead dwells in him. Wee are taught that Christ is true God, yea of the same most glorous eternall essence and substance with the Fa∣ther,Christ is true God of the sme most glorious es∣sence and sub∣stance with the Father, & he is God of himselfe. and hee is God of himselfe, equall to his Father, and this is cleare by many places of Scripture, that one is an excellent place to this purpose, Philippians 2.6. Where the Apostle saith that Christ Iesus being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God: that is being in the glory and maiesty of God, before his incarnation, he knew it to be no violence, iniury or vsurpation to bee e∣quall with God, for he was (in deed and truth) God of him∣selfe and of equall maiesty and glory with his Father from all eternity. I might further proue this by many reasons as by the propheticall predictions of Gods Prophets, spo∣ken only of the Lord of hosts, and applied by the Apostles to Christ; by the works of God truly imputed to Christ, as to make the world,  to forgiue sinnes, to know the hearts of men and the like; by his miracles and many moe reasons might be brought to proue the eternal Godhead of Christ,
that he is true God of himselfe, equall to his Father, if it were needfull; but come we to make vse of this point, and first this beeing a truth grounded on the word of God, it may not onely settle vs against many erroneous opinions which I will not now remember;  but it may serue to cleare the doctrine of our Church,The doctrine of our church cleered from an imputation which the pa∣pists cast vpon it. from a most vile and slande∣rous imputation cast vpon it by the Papists, they sticke not to charge the doctrine of our Church to bee faulty in no lesse then the highest degree of Atheisme, because wee teach this very point. That Christ is God of himselfe, and that he receaued not his Godhead from his Father. Against this, one in a popish pamphlet cries out & saith, vpon this position it followeth that there is neither father nor son in the godhead, & why so? marke his reason, for saith he, according to the common sence (see) common sence is the ground hee builds vpon in so high a mystery, he onlye is a true naturall son, that by generation doth receiue his nature and substance from his Father, if therefore the second person in Trinity did not receiue the godhead from the first, but had it of himselfe as the Protestants do affirme, than certainely he is no true son of the first, and consequently the first person is no true Father, and thus saith he, they ouerthrow both Father and Son in the Trinity, and are found faulty in the highest de∣gree of Atheisme; a foule fault indeed, if it were iustly char∣ged vpon vs, but to cleare vs from this blot and to answere him. First, it seemes this cauilling Sophister cannot or will not distinguish between Christs god-head & his persō, for we teach that Christ his godhead is of it selfe,Note. that Christ in regard of his god-head is of himselfe, as well as the Father, but that his person or sonship (as I may so speake) is from the Father as Christ is the second person in trinity, and the e∣ternall sonne, so is he from the Father, that is our doctrine, and so the popish argument is not to the purpose. Againe, this cauillers argument stands onely on sence, and reason, not on the word of God, and I answere further
vnto him, that the strict vrging of the naturall generation of man, as a pattern of the spirituall & vnspeakable genera∣tion of the son of God is most absurd, for it will make the son a distinct God from the father, yea, it will make Christ an inferior God to God his father, because the father shall haue his Godhead of himselfe, and the son not of himselfe but of his father, which things are in no wise to be granted we are to renounce them as vtterly false, and to hold it for a truth grounded on the word of God, that Christ is true God, yea, God of himselfe equall to his father. For a second vse of this poynt, wee are to build vp our selues in the comfort of truth,A ground of sweet com∣fort to all true beleeuers. it is a truth full of sweet com∣fort to as many as truely beleeue in Christ. And the consideration of this is, that Christ is true God may minister to them, not only this comfort, that they are made one with him by faith, who is the euer springing fountaine of all comfort, who is able to saue and deliuer them from death & damnation, from the Diuell and all the enemies of their saluation, which is a great comfort but it may raise vp their harts with further comfort as (name∣ly) this that they are one with him, who is most willing to saue them, yea, that will be sure to confer and bestow vpon them righteousnes and life euerlasting, for why? they are one with him who is true God, in whom is all fulnes and perfection not only of power, but of mercy and goodnes, fauour & louing kindnes; who is not only most powerfull but most gracious & ready to do them good, & will neuer suffer them to perish, & this is Christ his own argument of comfort and of assurance that none of his shall perish, nor the power of hell euer preuaile against them, that hee and his father are one. In the two verses before he saith, I will giue vnto them eternall life,Ioh. 10.30.28. ver. &c. then followeth the groūd of all, ver. 30. I and my father are one, as if he had sayd; I and my father are one in substance, will, power &c. ther∣fore none shall pluck my sheep out of my hand, none shall be able to take them out of my fathers hand.
in him, and need not any thing out of him, as a comple∣ment of their iustification and saluation. For why, they are perfectly iustified by Christ, they haue full and perfect remission of their sinnes, so as there is no condemnation to them, Rom. 8.1. and they are made the righteousnesse of God in him, 2. Corin. 5.21. therefore they neede nothing out of Christ to their iu∣stification. Againe, all the works of meditation wrought by Christ are most absolute and perfect, and neede nothing to bee added and adioyned, as a supplement vnto them to make them perfect, for Christ being God and man is a most per∣fect Sauiour, and therefore he doth perfectly iustifie and saue all that truely beleeue in him, the holy Ghost sayth, Heb. 7.25. he is able perfectly to saue them that come vn∣to God by him, seeing hee euer liueth to make intercission for them. Where then is any place for humane merits and satisfa∣ctions, surely, there is no place left vnto them,  wee truely beleeuing Christ need not to seeke satisfaction and remis∣sion of sinnes,Confutation of humane merits and sa∣tisfactions. any where but in Christ▪ in him wee haue full and perfect remission; the masses, pilgrimages and o∣ther workes of pennance which the Papists hold able to satisfie, doe mightiy derogate from the one full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice of Christ once offered vppon the crosse, Heb. 10.14. with one offering hath he consecrated or (as the word is) perfected for euer them that are sancti∣fied that sentence is worthy to bee duely considered our meditations are to dwell vpon it; with one offring hath he consecrated, and that for euer;How we may be kept from abusing that doctrine that in Christ we haue perfect iustification and saluation. no need then is there of any thing at any time out of Christ, and againe consider that the perfect satisfaction made by one offering of Christ belongs to them that are sanctified, that is also to bee considered and marked of vs to keepe vs from abu∣sing this doctrine, that true beleeuers need nothing to their iustification and saluation out of Christ for our
corruption will be ready to abuse this doctrine and teach vs to thinke thus with our selues, is nothing needefull to our iustification and saluation out of Christ, then a sancti∣fied holy life is needlesse, we must take knowledge from this worthy sentence of the holy Ghost; that this is a foo∣lish and deceiuing kinde of reasoning, it is all one as if thus wee should reason, nothing is needefull to iustification and saluation out of Christ, and therefore wee will not haue Christ himselfe, for such as are not sanctified, haue not Christ, they haue no part in the merit of his death and passion. Note.And further take we knowledge of this, that howsoeuer a sanctified life is not needfull to saluation in respect of a∣ny merit, yet is is needfull in respect of assurance of salua∣tion, and in regard of the degree of glory in heauen: the greater our sanctification is, the greater shall bee our glory in heauen, therefore learne we to hold the truth of the do∣ctrine now deliuered with the right vse of it, let vs content our selues with Christ alone, with his obedience, as most sufficient to our iustification and saluation, euen despising in respect of him all other merits and satisfactions whatso∣euer, yet so as we euer remember to whom the merit of his death and perfect obedience belongs (namely) to them that are sanctified, and that sanctified life is needfull in re∣spect of assurance of saluation, and regard of the degree of glory in heauen. The next thing wee are to marke is this, the Apostle sayth, ye are compleat in him, hee sayth not, yee are made compleat or made perfect from him, but in him; hence a∣riseth this conclusion. That the perfection of true beleeuers in this life is in Christ,The perfecti∣on of tue be∣leeuers in this life is in Christ. it is not wrought by Christ in themselues, the per∣fection by which we are perfectly iust in this life, is out of our selues in Christ, it is not any perfection infused and powred into vs, but a perfection in Christ, euen his perfect righteousnesse inherent and abiding in him, and not pow∣red
into vs, is our perfection in the sight of God in this life, 2. Cor. 5.21. the Apostle sayth directly, we are made the righteousnesse of God in Christ, Eph. 1.6. hee sayth, God by his grace made vs accepted or freely beloued, not through any perfection wrought in vs, or righteousnesse powred into vs by that grace, but altogether out of our selues in his beloued, Phillip. 9.3. the Apostle saith, he ac∣counted all things but losse and dung, that hee might bee found in him, and then he expounds himselfe in the words following, not hauing his owne righteousnes, but that per∣fect righteousnesse of Christ apprehended by faith; these places make it cleere, that the perfection by which we are perfectly iust in this life is out of our selues in Christ, and the reason of it is this. Because euen the best so long as they are in this life haue the corruption of sinne remaining in them,  though it bee not imputed to their condemnation, yet it dwelleth in them, Rom. 7.20. and defileth all their thoughts, words & actions, so as they cannot aspire to perfection of righteous∣nesse in themselues, but their perfection is only in Christ, and made theirs by the appplication of the spirit, and the apprehension of faith. This may serue first to strengthen vs against the errone∣ous  and false doctrine of the Papists,Strength a∣gainst a flse position of the Papists. who teach that a cer∣taine limited portion (for so they speake) of iustice or rigteousnesse, is deriued out of Christ his infinite righte∣ousnesse, and powred into this or that man, and so hee is made perfectly iust by that righteousnes inherent in him∣selfe; a doctrine directly contrary to the truth now deliue∣red, and such as hath no ground nor footing in the word of God, they are neuer able to shew it out of the word of God, that any portion of Christ his infinite iustice is infu∣sed into vs, and inherently made ours, that is a meere de∣uice of their owne braine. Secondly, this doctrine makes much for the comfort of all true beleeuers,Comfort to al true beleeuers for why? is it so that our perfection in
this life is not in our selues, but out of our selues in Christ, this then may minister singular comfort to all such as tru∣ly beleeue in Christ, if we looke into our selues, and be a∣ble to search our selues, we shall finde a world of imperfe∣ctions in vs, imperfect knowledge, yea, more ignorance then knowledge, imperfect faith mingled wth much vn∣beleefe, weake and feeble hope &c. yea, nothing in our selues if we be not partiall in our selues, but cause of doubt∣ting, distrust and vtter despaire, but on the other side, when we remember that perfection is not to be sought for in our selues, but in Christ, and if we truely beleeue in Christ, that euen in this life amidst our manifold imperfections, wee haue fulnesse and perfection of righteousnesse in him, and that in him wee are compleat and perfect, it will raise vp our hearts with excellent comfort, yea, it will enlarge our hearts with this comfort, further, that our perfection bee∣ing in Christ it can neuer bee lost,Note. wee shall bee as sure as Christ is in heauen, to finde perfect righteousnesse to our iustification and saluation, for our perfection is laid vp in Christ, who is now in heauen at the right hand of his father, and therefore nothing can take our perfection out of his hands: it is the Apostles argument Rom. 8, 34. it is Christ which is dead, yea, or rather, which is risen againe. who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs; who therefore shall condemne saith the Apo∣stle, so may euery true beleeuer truely say, my perfection is layd vp in Christ, who is at the right hand of his father, who therefore shall take it from me, not all the power of hell is able to depriue me of it, and that is an excellent com∣for, and to be thought on to the comfort of all that truely  beleeue in Iesus Christ. Now from the words following, which is the head, and obserue we onely this, that we are to consider Christ euen whole Christ God and man in respect of the Angels as a Lord ouer them and farre aboue them,Whole Christ God & man is Lord ouer the Angels and farre a∣boue them. the Apostle spea∣king of the aduancement of Christ, Ephes. 1.21. sayth,
God raised him from the dead, & set him at his right hand in the heauenly places farre aboue all principality, and po∣wer, and might, and domination, and euery name that is named, not in this world onely, but also in that, that is to come, Heb. 1.4. the holy Ghost saith, Christ made is much more excellent then the Angels, inasmuch as hee hath ob∣tained a more excellent name then they. And first in this respect, wee are to bee stricken with  due admiration of the Maiesty and glory of Iesus Christ for indeede, admiration and magnifying of the Angels,We are to be sticken with due admirati∣on of the Ma∣iesty and glo∣ry of Christ. hath beene the cause of giuing too much vnto them, euen diuine worship and adoration: of that poynt wee shall speake heereafter, but in that Christ is Lord and Gouer∣nour of the Angels, it may be matter of great comfort to all that truely beleeue in him, and of terrour to all vnbelee∣uing  persons.It is matter of comfort to the godly and of terror to the wicked that Christ is Lod of the Angels. Of comfort to all true beleeuers, because Christ their head is also head of the good Angels, and will bee sure to send them out to minister vnto them for their good, for their protection and comfort at all times, as wee haue it Heb. 1.14. they are ministring spirits, sent foorth to mini∣ster for their sakes, which shall be heires of saluation, yea,Comfort. they haue a charge layd on them by Christ, to watch ouer thee, and to keepe thee in all thy wayes if thou belong to him, yea, to keepe and protect thee (if it bee good for thee) from common dangers and calamities that bee in the world, a matter of great comfort to all true beleeuers, on the contrary,Terrour. it may strike vnbeleeuers with terror that Christ is the Lord of the good Angels, and hath them at command to execute vengeance vpon them, we read in the Scripture, that the Angels destroied Sodome, plagued the Aegyptians, and slue in one night, an hundred foure-score and fiue thousand in Senacheribs hoast, 2. King. 19.35. how then ought men to tremble and to stand in awe of Iesus Christ the Lord of these glorious and powerfull creatures and as the Psalmist sayth, Psal. 2.12. kisse the son least he be
angry, and so they perish and be vtterly destroyed, for cer∣tainly, if men doe not in time make peace with this great Lord of Angels, he will one day, as the Apostle sayth, 2. Thess. 1.7. shew himselfe from heauen with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendring vengeance vnto them that doe not know God, and obey not his Gospell, let this bee thought on by all hard hearted and vnrepentant sin∣ners. VER. 11. In whom also ye are circumcised with circum∣cision made without hands, by putting off the sinnefull body of the flesh, through the circumcision of Christ. This verse is an anticipation or preuention of a secret obiection. For the Colssioans might say, you tell vs that wee are compleate in Christ, but there bee some tea∣chers that say, wee Gentiles wanting circumcision are vncleane, and therefore not perfect in Christ, this the A∣postle meetes withall in this verse, and saith, that in Christ they also were circumcised: and in this verse the Apostle beginnes to reason against the third meanes of corrup∣tion vsed by seducers spoken of verse the 6. (namely) the rudiments of the world, the legall doctrine touch∣ing circumcision sacrifices and ceremonies among the Iewes, and he beginnes in particular to deale against cir∣cumcision shewing that the beleeuing Colossians needed not to be outwardly circumcised in the flesh, as a comple∣ment or meanes to adde any thing to their perfection in Christ; his reason is this. You are by the power of Christ inwardly circum∣cised, therefore you need not outward circumci∣on in the flesh. That is the summe and substance of this verse, and so stands the Apostles reason against outward circum∣cision.
Now before I come to speake more particularly of this verse, a doubt must be remooued, some may take excepti∣on against the Apostles argument, as insufficient, and say, it is not to the purpose and question in hand, and not con∣tinuing in the termes of the question. For the question betweene the Apostle and false tea∣chers was,Ob. whether circumcision in the flesh were necessa∣ry or no, the Apostle sayth no, it is not necessary, his rea∣son is, because they were inwardly circumcised. Now may some say, this is not to the purpose, this prooues not out∣ward circumcision to be therefore needlesse, because they were inwardly circumcised; if this be a sufficient argument against outward circumcision; then this also is a good ar∣gument against outward baptisme, that such as are inward∣ly washed by the holy Ghost, need not outward baptisme, but we see that to be contrary by the practise of Peter, who commanded that Cornelius his family and others met to∣gether, being inwardly baptized by the holy Ghost, should be also baptized with water in the name of the Lord Iesus, therefore this seemes to be no sound and sufficient argu∣ment vsed by the Apostle. Ye are inwardly circumcised, and therefore need not outward circumcision. For the remouall of this doubt,  we must consider a diffe∣rence & distinction of times (namely) of the time vnder the old Testament, & the time vnder the new Testament, of the time before the comming of Christ in the flesh, & the time after, in the time of the old Testament, such an argu∣ment as the Apostle vseth, had been weak and insufficient because then circumcision was in force, both as a signe of the Messiah to come, & a seale of righteousnes & regene∣ration, but in the time of the new Testament, the Messiah being come, the Apostles argument is strong and sufficient because then circumcision with the whole regiment of Moses is abolished, & the instance of baptisme is not to the purpose, because there is now this difference between out∣ward
circumcision, and outward baptisme, the one is abo∣lished and remooued by the comming of Christ, and the other standeth in force, by the institution and commande∣ment of Iesus Christ, therefore these two reasons are not alike. Yea are inwardly circumcised, and therefore neede not outward circumcision; that is a good argument, and ye are inwardly baptized, and therefore need not outward baptisme, that is insufficient, and to come some short vse of this before we passe from it;  is it so that the reason of the Apostle had been naught, if circumcision had been in force as it was in time of the old Testament, then let vs thinke vpon it in the like case, that it is no good argument, and no sufficient plea, for thee whosoeuer thou art to say, I haue the effect of this or that sacrament inwardly wrought in me, and the inward fruit of it, therefore I neede not vse the outward Sacrament, but at my pleasure when I will my selfe; it may bee this is the conceit of such as sel∣dome come to the Table of the Lord, happily, once or twice in a yeere, it may bee they thinke thus, I haue that in mee which the Sacrament can seale vp vnto me (name∣ly) true faith in the bloud of Christ, what need I then of∣ten to come to the Lords Table, oh remember whosoeuer thou art (if this be the thought of thine heart) that this is a deceiuing thought, this is not sufficient to excuse thy wilfull withdrawing of thy selfe from the Sacrament this will not cleere thee from being found guilty of great contempt of the order, that Iesus Christ hath left in his Church, that euen such as haue the greatest measure of faith should often come, to testifie and seale vp the same by receiuing the outward sacrament, & if thou bee a con∣temner of Christ his order, thou art then one of those him∣selfe speaks of,Luk. 19.14. who will not haue him to raigne ouer thee, and that punishment threatned ver. 27. shall one day light on thee, those mine enemies which would not that I should raigne ouer them, bring them hether and slay them before me, the Lord wil cut thee off, & giue thee thy portion with hypocrites.
Come we now to speake of this verse more particularly, we may obserue it in these things layd before vs. First, that in Christ the beleeuing Colossians were cir∣cumcised, In whom also ye are circumcised. Secondly, the manner of their circumcision; with cir∣cumcision made without hands. Thirdly, what it was (namely) a putting off the sinfull body of the flesh. And lastly, by what meanes it was wrought and how they were in Christ citcumcised (namely) through his cir∣cumcision; through the circumcision of Christ, of these in order. In whom also ye are circumcised with circumcision made without hands: for the right conceiuing of these words, we must know that circumcision among the Iewes was a cut∣ting off of the foreskinne of the flesh as appeares in the in∣stitution of it,Interpreta∣tion. Gen. 17.10.11. and that cutting off the foreskinne was among them a Sacrament answerable to our Sacrament of Baptisme, a signe of Gods couenant of grace, as the Lord there sayth, and a seale of righteous∣nesse,Rom. 4.11. as the Apostle saith now as in our Sacrament of bap∣tisme, there is the outward washing of water, and the in∣ward washing of the spirit in them that are truely baptised, so was there among the Iewes an outward circumcision in the flesh a cutting off of the foreskin of the flesh, & an in∣ward circumcision of the hart, a cutting off of the fore-skin of the hart by the spirit of God; thus then we are to vnder∣stand the Apostle when he saith, in whom also ye are circū∣cised with circumcision made without hands as if he had thus spoken. In Christ also ye beleeuing Colossians haue the foreskinne cut off aswell as the Iewes, I meane the in∣ward foreskinne of your hearts, which is not cut off by the hand of man, but by the finger of God, euen by the spirit of God. Now first in that the Apostle sayth; the beleeuing Co∣lossians who were not outwardly circumcised, were not∣withstanding inwardly circumcised, & that they in Christ
had the effect of circumcision without the outward signe of circumcision: Hence we may gather this conclusion. That the grace of God is not tied to the outward signe and the outward Sacrament,Gods grace is not tied to the outward sige of the Sacrament. grace signified by circumci∣sion, may bee had without circumcision in the flesh-as ap∣peares plainely by these words of the Apostle, grace is not tyed to the outward signe or sacrament. Ob.But to preuent an obiection in the beginning, some may say indeed, grace signified by circumcision, may now be had without circumcision, because the outward signe is not now in force, but in time of the old Testament it could not be had without circumcision, for the Lord sayth, Gen. 17.14, the vncircumcised manchilde in whose flesh the foreskinne is not circumcised, euen that person shall be cut off from his people, &c. & consequently grace cannot now be had without the outward signes of grace: Therefore grace is tyed to the Sacrament. To this I answer, first, that euen then when circumcisi∣on was in force, the grace of God was not tied to it; for the Lords owne appoyntment, was that the childe should not be circumcised till the eighth day, Gen. 17.11. which hee would not haue done, if grace had beene tied to circumci∣sion, and 40. yeeres together was circumcision omitted in the wildernesse, Iosua 5.6.7. and yet we are not to say, whosoeuer among them died in that time wanted grace to saluation, farre be that from vs. Againe, for the place alledged; I answer, that place is to be vnderstood of such as were of yeeres and discretion, & not of infants, for it is not sayd, the vncircumcised person being an infant, but indefinitely the vncircumcised, and there is reason so to vnderstand it from the text it selfe, for the Lord sayth in the last words of the verse, because hee hath broken my couenant; now to breake Gods couenant is not incident to infants but to men of yeeres, we see then grace to saluation, euen in the time of the old Testament, when circumcision was in force, might bee had without
that outward signe, if there were no wilfull neglect or con∣tempt of it; and consequently, grace is not tyed, either then or now to the outward signe or Sacrament of grace, the words of Dauid after the death of the childe that died before the eight day, 2. Sam. 12.23. are to be considered, I shall go to it, sayth Dauid, without question, he meant not that the childe was not in hell, or in any Limbus infantum as the Papists dreame, but he comforted himselfe by con∣ceiued hope it was with the Lord, and thither himselfe should goe. Remember againe, the theefe on the crosse that repented and was conuerted, Christ sayth to him, Luk. 23.43. this day shalt thou be with me in Paradice, yet he wanted the outward sacrament of baptisme. This I deliuer to this purpose,  euen to strengthen vs a∣gainst feare,Comfort a∣gainst feare & doubting of the saluation of children dying before they be bap∣tized. and doubting of the saluation of children ta∣ken away before they can come to baptisme; there is som∣times a scruple and doubt striking in the mindes of some touching children, that die without the outward sacra∣ment of baptisme, wee must learne to cast out that scruple and know that God is not worse to vs vnder the Gospell, then hee was to them vnder the law, nor lesse able to saue the seed of the faithfull, now without baptisme then hee was then without circumcision; his grace was not then free and now bound, then great and now little, then strong & now weake, we are not so to imagine, it were a wrong, yea, a blasphemy against the infinit mercy of our gracious God and the God of thy seed, not adding any condition of baptisme if it cannot be had as it ought. Oh but there is one speech of Christ himselfe,Ob. that hap∣pily strikes deepe, and it is obiected by the Papists Ioh. 3.5. to prooue an absolute necessity of outward baptisme our Sauiour sayth there, except a man bee borne of water and of the spirit, hee cannot enter into the Kingdome of God; behold say they, a plaine proofe that outward bap∣tisme is absolutely necessary to saluation. I answer, first it can neuer be prooued by sound reason,
that, that place is to be vnderstood of infants, but rather of men of yeeres, for if we marke it, Nicodemus his question vers. 4. was this, how can a man that is old be borne; can he enter into his mothers womb againe, & be borne? our Sauiour answereth (holding (no doubt) to the termes of that question) verily, verily, except a man growen in yeers in whom there is either wilfull neglect, or contempt of baptisme be borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot en∣ter &c. And againe, it is no more necessary, that by water in this place, we should vnderstand materiall water, then by the word fire, Mat. 3.11. we should vnderstand mate∣riall fire: but rather, by water we are to vnderstand the of∣fice and worke of the holy Ghost (namely) spirituall wa∣shing, as if our Sauiour had sayd, except a man bee borne of the spirituall washing of the holy Ghost, and this is a∣greeable to that which followeth ver. 6. that which is borne of the spirit is spirit, and ver. 8. so is euery one that is borne of the spirit, where wee finde no mention of water; it re∣maines then notwithstanding this speech of Christ that outward baptisme is not of absolute necessity to saluation, therefore let vs not feare the saluation of infants departed this life in regard of the want of outward baptisme; but looke wee with comfort to the couenant God hath made with the faithfull, that he will be their God, and the God of their seed. Wee are further to marke that the Apostle sets out the inward circumcision of the Colossians, in these termes, circumcision made without hands, hence we may take vp this conclusion. That the inward circumcision of the heart, the cutting of the desiled foreskinne of the heart,The inward circumcision of the heart is not a worke of mans hand but of the po∣werfull hand of God. and taking away the corruption of it, is not a worke of the hand of man, but it is a worke of the finger of God, and onely wrought by the powerfull hand of God; hence it is that Moses sayth, Deu. 30.6. the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou mayst loue the Lord thy
God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, that thou maist liue, the reason of this is. Because inward circumcision of the heart,  the inward purging of the heart, is a new creation as Dauid prayed, Psal. 51.10. create in me a cleane heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me; therefore proper only to the hand of God; Now least we stumble and bee not able to keepe our selues from falling in respect of precepts giuen in scrip∣ture to circumcise our owne hearts, to change them, and the like, Ierem. 4.4. be circumcised to the Lord;Note. we must know that all such precepts giuen in Scripture to men since the fall of Adam and in his corrupt state doe not signifie and imply any power in man to performe them, but teach vs our duty, that we are to seeke for helpe, where it is to be had euen at the hands of God, and let that be the first vse of this poynt. That seeing circumcision of the heart, is a worke onely  of the hand of God, let vs then euer seeke and sue to him that he would vouchsafe to put his hand into our bosoms,We are to seek and sue to the Lord that hee would circum¦cise our harts. and plucke off the foreskinne of our hearts, and take away the corruption of them. And againe, if the Lord haue in any measure circumci∣sed  our hearts,The whole praise & glory of our conuer∣sion must be giuen to the Lord. let vs giue him the whole praise and glory of that worke, looke not too much on the outward instru∣ment; doe not too much gaze vpon the excellency of the gifts of any that hath beene a meanes of thy conuersion, least so thou giue part of the glory to the instrument, but euer haue thine eye vpon the mighty power of the Lord whose onely worke it hath beene, remember that Paul or Apollos, are but the ministers of God, by whom thou hast beene brought to beleeue, 1. Cor. 3.5. blesse God for them, but giue him alone all the praise, and all the glory of that great worke. Now come wee to the words following, By putting off the sinnefull body of the flesh through the circumcision of Christ. Wherein the Apostle sets downe what is the inward cir∣cumcision,
namely, a putting of the sinnefull body of the flesh (by putting of) these words are often vsed by the Apo∣stle in the like matter that is heere handled, as cap. 3. 9. see∣ing ye haue put off the old man with his workes;Interpreta∣tion. Ephes. 4.22. that ye cast off concerning the conuersation in time past, the old man which is corrupt through the deceiuea∣ble lusts, and they are metphoricall, borrowed and taken from vncloathing of the body, or the stripping off of the apparell, and doe signifie the manner of taking away, and abolishing of the inward corruption of the heart, that it is after the manner of incloathing the body, or rather in∣deed of putting off the skinne of the body, the heart and inward parts and powers of the soule being enwrapped & encompassed with corruption as with a filthy garment or leprous skinne (sinnefull body) the word body doth not heere signifie any corporeall substance, consisting of flesh, bloud and bones, but is also a word vsed by way of simili∣tude: to signifie the massie lumpe of corruption, and that lumpe of corruption is expressed by this word (body) to signfie the greatnesse and extension of it, that it is as a body hauing all dimensions, height, length, breadth and thicknesse, and as hauing all the parts of a foule monstrous and reformed body, in which are found all sinnes bound vp it were in one body, which breake out as any occasion is offered, hence it is that the Apostle calles diuerse foule sinnes breaking out of this body, our member, cap. 3.5. by sinnefull body, then vnderstand we, the sinnefull masse or lumpe of corruption (of the flesh) by the word (flesh) wee are to vnderstand the corruption of nature, euen of the whole nature of man of all the powers and abilities both of soule and body, for it is frequent and vsuall in Scripture to put the word (flesh) for the corruption of nature; and not only to signifie the corruption of the inferiour parts of the soule, as the affections, appetite and sences, but also of the superiour, euen of the reasonable soule, and of the powers thereof, the minde, will, memory and conscience, Ro. 8.7.
the wisedome of the flesh (that is) the wisedome of the minde, for that is the seat of wisedome, in the naturall and corrupt state of it is enimity against God; and the reason why the corruption of the whole nature of man is called flesh, is this, because it comes by propagation, by naturall and carnall generation, and that that is borne of the flesh is flesh. Ioh. 3.6. so then the full sence and meaning of the Apostle in these words, by putting off the sinnefull body of the flesh, is this. By taking away and stripping off, as it were a leaprous filthy garment or skinne, the sinnefull masse, lumpe and body of the naturall corruption of the whole man, euen of all the powers and abilities of soule and body. Heere first obserue we that the Apostle sets out the in∣ward circumcision of the heart in these termes, that it is a putting off, an vncloathing or a stripping off of the filthy leaprous garment of corruption; hence we are taught. That the spirit of God inwardly circumcising and rege∣nerating  the heart,Regeneration doth not abo∣lish any facul∣ty of the soule or any natu∣rall affection of it, but only taketh away the corrupti∣on of them. doth not take away the substance of the heart, but the corruption of it, regeneration is not an abo∣lishing or taking away of any faculty of the soule, as vnder∣standing, memory, will, conscience or any naturall affecti∣on of the soule, but onely a stripping of the filthinesse and corruption of them; for why, naturall corruption is not a substantiall thing as some haue thought, nor a corrupti∣on of the substance of the soule, for then could not the soul be immortall, if the substance of it were corrupted, nor Christ haue taken mans nature without sinne, but it is a corruption cleauing and clinging to the faculties of the soule, and to the affections of the heart, and such as may be remooued by the powerfull worke of Gods spirit, and hence is it sayd to be an euill that doth compasse s about Heb. 12.1. cast away euery thing that presseh downe, and the sinne that hangeh so fast on, or that doth so easily
compasse vs about, so the originall word signifieth therfore regeneration is not an abolishing of any faculty of the soule, but a putting off of that filthinesse, and that corrup∣tion that doth enwrappe and compasse about euery facul∣ty of it, this I note in a word, it may be vnto vs one ground of triall,  whether we be truely regenerate or no; it may serue as one meanes whereby we may know it (for marke) regeneration is not a taking away of any faculty of the soule,Triall of the soundnesse & truth of our regeneration. or of any affection of the heart, but of the corrupti∣on of it, heereby then examine thy selfe, no doubt thou art or mayst bee acquainted with the disposition of thine owne heart, (I say not with the depth, and all the de∣uices of it, the heart of man is deceitfull and wicked a∣boue all things, who can know it? Ierem. 17.9. onely the searcher of the heart, the Lord he knowes it, but with a little obseruation thou mayst be acquainted with the natu∣rall inclination and disposition of thine heart, in regard of the predominant and chiefe ruling affections of it, whe∣ther it bee naturally giuen most of all to feare, to loue, to ioy, to sorrow, to anger or the like; well then, knowing the chiefe ruling affection of thine owne heart, see whether that affection still remain in thee in the force & strength of it without the corruption of it, if it do, then thou art truely regenerate, but if it doe not, thou doest but flatter and de∣ceiue thy selfe, for example, if thou beest one giuen to too much ioy, and much reioycing, thou art one of a merry & cheerefull disposition, see whether thy ioy and thy reioy∣cing be still as great and strong as euer it was, not in sinne and in outward carnall things, for that is the sinnefulnesse of it, but in God and in good things, if thou find that thou canst now reioyce, not in filthy carnall pleasure in drun∣kennesse or good fellowship, as it is called, nor so much reioyce in the outward blessings of this life, but that thou canst as heartily reioyce as euer thou couldest, yea, thou canst more heartily reioyce in the loue and mercy of God in Iesus Christ, in his seruice and obedience to his will, for
his loue and goodnesse, then in any other thing, that is a sure marke of a good and regenerate heart, and that the spirit of God hath wrought powerfully in thee, and strip∣ped off the sinnefulnesse and corruption of thy ioy and cheerefulnesse in thee by nature; So if thou be one of a hot hasty and cholericke nature; if thou find that naturall an∣ger of thine stripped off; the sinnefulnesse of it (namely) the rashnes, the easines to be prouoked vpon euery trifling occasion, the excesse in the measure, making thee to forget duty both to God and man, and the expressing of it, for meere priuate causes concerning thine owne person, and not the cause of God; (for these are the filthy rags where∣with thy naturall anger is cloathed) if thou finde not that affection it selfe abolished, but these things taken from it, and that thine anger is now stirred vp, vpon waighty and manifest offence to God conceiued with deliberation; kindled through desire to maintaine Gods glory; loue of iustice and vertue, and directed against sinn, and not the person of the sinner, but with loue to his person, and sor∣row for the sinne, and with moderation, not making thee vnfit for duties to God and man, then is that affection wrought vpon by the spirit of God, then is thine anger a holy, iust and sanctified anger, and thus mayst thou trye thy selfe in other affections, and remember it, that regene∣ration is not a taking away of any affection of the heart, but a stripping off of the corruption of it. We are in the next plac to marke that the Apostle saith, inward circumcision is a putting off, or a taking away of the body of the flesh, not some part, but of the whole bo∣dy  of it; Hence we may take vp this conclusion.True regene∣ration is a re∣moouall of corruption from all the powers & fa∣culties of the soule. That true regenaration is entire, it is an abolishing of the whole masse and lumpe of naturall corruption (that is) of naturall corruption in all the powers and faculties of the soule, not a remoouing of corruption from the minde a∣lone, or will alone, but from all and euery faculty of the soule, hence it is in other termes expressed to be a putting
off the old man, giuing vs to vnderstanst that it is an entire worke, euen as the putting out of a perfect man, with all the parts & members of a perfect man, for indeed where the spirit of God, doth work vpon any man to the purging & taking away of his naturall corruption,  he doth work vpon all the powers of his soule, grace is neuer effectuall truely to purge one faculty of the soule and not another? if naturall blindnesse, ignorance and dulnesse of mind be taken away by sanctifying grace, the will and affections are also wrought vpon in like proportion, and hence is re∣generation called a new creation, and a new birth, and ther∣fore it is entire, and of the whole man, it were easie to en∣large the proofe of this; but for the vse of it. Is it so, that where the Spirit of God doth effectually worke regeneration;None ought to think him∣selfe truely re∣generate vnles he finde him∣selfe through∣out wrought vpon by the Spirit of God. he puts off the whole body of cor∣ruption, let no man then deceiue himselfe, let no man think he is truly regenerat, because happily he is inlightned and hath a generall ffooting knowledge of the Mysteries of the Gospel, & yet notwithstanding is carried away with some inordinate affection, or some corrupt lust to pride, to couetousnesse, to drunkennesse, to sensuall pleasure, to someone grosse sinne or other, if this be true regeneration then Herod and Iudas were truely regenerate, Herod knew much, and did many good things, yet was he a meere car∣nall man, possessed with inordinate loue of his brothers wife. Iudas a disciple of Christ and no question, Christ taught him, and he taught others many good things, yet was he a carnall man, carried away with the inordinate lust of couetousnesse, and therefore deceiue not thy selfe think not that the Spirit of God hath wrought on thee to thy re∣generation, vnlesse thou finde that hee hath put off the the whole body of thy corruption, and haue crucified the flesh withall the inordinate affections and lusts of it, and withall remember, that except thou bee truely regenerate thou hast no part nor portion in Gods Kingdome, that is, Christ his owne speech, Ioh. 3.5.
Now heere a question may be mooued (namely) this. How farre foorth the whole body of corruption is put off and taken away in them that are truely regenerate? To this I answer,  that the body of corruption is put a∣way onely in part in this life, though the Spirit of God doe worke vpon all the powers of the soule, and put off the bo∣dy of corruption in such as are regenerate, yet not wholly and perfectly for the time of this life, therefore the Apo∣stle heere speakes in the present time, and sayth, inward circumcision is a putting off of the sinnefull body of the flesh, signifying a continuall act neuer perfected in this life the corruption of nature remaines till death, in the most regenerate, though not imputed vnto them, the Apostle affirmes it of himselfe, Rom. 7.3. and hee calles it sinne in many verses of that chapter which the Papists deny, I will not stand to dispute the question, but I say, it remaines in the most regenerate not imputed vnto them, and woun∣ded, so as the regenerate doe not serue it, Rom. 6.6. nor subiect themselues to the tyranny of it, to obey it in the lusts thereof▪ as the Apostle teacheth, also by implication Rom. 6.12. let not sinne raigne therefor in your mortall body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof, and heer∣in is a maine difference betweene the regenerate and vnre∣generate. In the vnregenerate, the Spirit of God doth on∣ly restraine and hold backe corruption, or for a time turne the affections of their hearts cleane another way for the good of his children, as hee did the hearts of the Aegypti∣ans Exod. 12.36. the Lord gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Aegyptian, and the heart of Saul towards Da∣uid for a time, 1. Sam. 24.17. but shortly after his hatred brake out againe, and he purposed to kill him, and thus doth the Spirit of God, eithet restraine or turne the affe∣ctions of the heart another way in the vnregenerate onely for a time, but afterwards it breakes out and shewes it selfe againe, but in the regenerate, the Spirit of God doth take away the power of naturall corruption, so as at no time it
beares sway in them, but they hate it, and labor & groane for deliuerance from it, and though sometimes it giue them a blow and a wound, yet is it with much reluctation and striuing against it, as the Apostle sayth of himselfe Rom. 7.15. and after that they recouer themselues by speedy repentance. Now further in that the Apostle doth expresse the cor∣ruption of nature vnder this word (body) signifying that it is as a body, hauing as it were all dimensions of a body, Hence we are taught. That the corruption of nature is exceeding great, it is no light superficiall thing,The corrupti∣on of nature is as it were a massie & sub∣stantiall body and it hath a reall being, & is exceeding great. no shadow, but as it were a mas∣sie and substantiall body, it is not as some haue taught, on∣ly a priuation, an absence or want of that holinesse and righteousnesse that ought to be in vs, but it is more, euen a positiue thing, such a thing as hath a reall being, it is both a guiltinesse in respect of Adams sinne, for in Adam all sinned Rom. 5.12. and it is an inclination or pronenesse of all the faculties of the soule, to that which is euill and a∣gainst the Law of God, the vnderstanding is not onely blinde, but carried to errour and vaine imaginations the will is not onely nilling, or not willing that which is good, but auerse and repugnant, and striuing against it, and wil∣ling onely that which is euill continually, it is sayd, Gen. 6.5. the Lord saw that the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, & why? all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were onely euill continually, and that the greatnesse of the corruption of nature may yet further ap∣peare, consider we the diffusion and spreading of it, it is as a leprosie spread ouer all the powers of the soule, there is not one free spot in the soule, but all and euery one is de∣filed with it, hence it is called the old man, giuing to vn∣derstand that the naturall man is nothing, but as a man made of corruption, it is euen as the man himselfe, and do not naturall and carnall men demonstrate and prooue this, abridge them of their lusts, and they thinke they are no
men they had rather dy then be abridged of thē, & hence is it also called the law of the members, Rom. 7.23. because all the powers of the soule and parts of the body are sub∣iect to it as to a Law. Againe, consider wee the comprehension of it, it con∣taines, all sinnes in it as a root, or as an Ocean sea, sending out into euery channell and vaine of the body streams & flouds of sin, so as one saith well, if all the heresies that be were ceased in the world, yet if God leaue a man to him∣selfe, hee hath in himselfe sufficient matter and spawne to breed and reuiue all kinde of errours and sinne, the Apo∣stle Gal. 5.19.20. hauing reckoned vp many workes of the flesh, is forced to conclude and say. ver. 21. and such like, as being not able to thinke of all the sinnes, that doe as fire sparkle out of that furnace. Last of all; the greatnesse of the corruption of nature may plainely appeare in that it takes occasion by the commandement of God, to breake out and to shew it selfe as the Apostle sayth, Rom. 7.8. sinne (meaning the cor∣ruption of nature) tooke occasion by the commandement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence; and a∣gaine ver. 13. this sinne that it might appeare sinne (that is) exceeding great, wrought death in mee by that which is good, that sinne might be out of measure sinnefull by the commandement; it is heerein like the gangrene or elephantiasis the leprosie, it is made worse by that which should be a means to cure it, it breakes out vpon the com∣mandement of God, if then we duely consider the sprea∣ding, the comprehension and swelling of our naturall cor∣ruption it breaking out vpon the commandement of God, which is giuen as a remedy against it, wee must needs con∣fesse it to be exceeding great. Now then this being so, that our naturall corruption is so exceeding great, it being not onely a want of that holi∣nesse, that ought to be in vs, but a pronenesse to all euill spread ouer all the powers of the soule containing the
seed of all sinnes, and breaking out vpon the commande∣ment of God:  let no man thinke it a small matter to bee a naturall man,We are not to thinke it a small matter to be in our naturall con∣ditiō as many foolishly doe. and a light and trifling thing to bee in his naturall condition; some there be who please themselues and hold themselues in very good case, because they are no drunkards, no whoremongers, or the like; they can∣not iustly be charged with any grosse offence: yea, some sticke not to bolt out this, or the like foolish speech, that Preachers should lay before men onely their open grosse sinnes, and deale onely against drunkennesse, whoredom, and such like sinnes: a speech tasting of a filthy vessell whence it comes; yea, sent out (be it spoken with reue∣rence) from a very dunghill of filthinesse and corruption: thou that thus speakest, whosoeuer thou art, thou hast yet a rotten and a filthy stinking heart, this argues thou doest not know and conceiue the corruption of thine owne na∣ture, nor the staine and danger of it: thou art yet in bon∣dage to thine owne corruption, and a vassaile and slaue to the Deuill, therefore thinke vpon it; and surely, such as thinke they are in a good case onely because they are no drunkards, no whooremongers, or the like; they see not the inward sinne of their hearts, and their corruption of nature, for they may be so by restraining grace, and yet lie wallowing in the puddle of their owne filthinesse, and for a man to thinke himselfe in good case, onely because hee is free from the act of some palpable sinnes; it is all one as if a Traitor to his Prince, should thinke himselfe free from danger of Law and execution, because he cannot iustly be charged with pettie pilfring or stealing, for it is not onely actuall transgression of Gods Law, but euen our naturall corruption, and that chiefly: it being the mother sinne, and the seed of all other sinnes that doth seuer vs from Gods fauour, and make vs stand subiect to Gods curse and euerlasting perdition. Let vs then labour to see the greatnesse of our naturall guilt and corruption, and to see our selues vnder Gods wrath in regard of it, and seeing it,
bewaile and lament for it aboue all things; yea, whensoe∣uer wee make confession to God of any knowne actuall sinne, we are then to be brought to the sight of that sinne, euen to see with sorrow the roote of it, and all our other sinnes, and to cry out with Paul, Rom. 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death. And with Dauid, Psal. 51.5. Behold I was borne in inquity, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued mee. For confession of some knowne sinne may be forced out from selfe-loue, feare of shame, punishment, or such like, and vnlesse by that sinne wee bee brought downe to the roote of all our sinnes,Note. and to haue sense and sorrow for that also, we shall neuer finde ease or reliefe by Christ, hee came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance, Matth. 9.13. and not euery sinner, but that sinner that condemnes sinne in himselfe, and especially the mother sinne, and is weary and laden and groanes vnder the bur∣den of it. Mat. 11.28. In that the Apostle calles the corruption of the whole  nature of man, and of all the powers of the soule (Flesh) he would haue vs to know that the corruption of nature comes by propagation,The corrup∣tion of nature comes by pro∣pagation. it comes not as Pelagius & his fol∣lowers taught by imitation, children haue not a want of holinesse that ought to be in them, and a pronenesse to sinne in all the powers of their soules by imitation, but it is conuaid vnto them from their parents by naturall gene∣ration, as we are plainely taught, Gen. 5.3. It is there said, that Adam after his fall begat Sheth in his owne likenesse (that is) corrupted like to himselfe. For as Iob speaks Chap. 14.1. Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse, it is not possible. Hence we are said to be children of wrath by nature, or natiuity, euen so borne, Ephes. 2.3. And most plainely speakes Dauid to this purpose Psalm. 51.5. I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me; and if we desire further euidence and proofe of this, consider we but this one thing, that many times some par∣ticular
and inward euill quality of the parents is found in the childe in his infancy before he can learne it by imita∣tion, and therefore it is conuaid and transmitted from the parent to the child by generation,Note. I say many times, not alwaies, for it pleaseth God sometimes of his goodnesse to stay the course of a particular euill quality and disposition, that it passe not from the Parent to the childe, as he did in the birth of Hezekiah the sonne of a most wicked Father King Ahaz, and of Iosiah sonne of wicked Amon: but ori∣ginall corruption common to the stocke, and common to mankind, is euer conuaid from the parents to the child by the propagation of it, is perpetuall by naturall genera∣tion. And this must teach vs to take heede of Pride and swel∣ling  in regard of birth and parentage,We must take heede of pride and swelling in respect of parentage. men commonly looke at the worthinesse of their parents, and boast much of the dignity and eminency of their ancestours in respect of their bloud, riches, honour, and such like; but if they looke as they ought, they should finde matter enough to humble them, they shall finde that their father was an A∣morite, &c. as the Prophet speakes Ezek. 16.3. and that they are in the common condition of all men, pollu∣ted in their bloud; and though they receiue from their parents outward glory and honour, yet withall they re∣ceiue such an hereditary common corruption and disease, yea it may be, together with that, such particular infection as makes them odious in the sight of God; and if the course of it bee not staied, it will poison their bodies and  soules more and more, till at length both body and soule like a rotten poisoned thing drop downe into hell. Againe, is it so that naturall corruption comes by pro∣pagation, then let this stirre vp all parents to labour to e∣state and intitle their children in something, that may be for the good of their soulesParents must labour to e∣state their children in something that may bee for the good of their soules that their children descending of them, may be intituled to some thing that may bee for their good.
How is that to be done may some say? Answ. Let them labour to bring themselues within the couenant of grace and to become true beleeuing members of Christ, and then though they cannot deriue their faith and holinesse vnto them, because they begette them not as good men and beleeuers, but as men simply by the power and strength of nature, yet by vertue of the couenant, God will bee good and gracious to their chil∣dren, Gen. 26. We read many blessings promised to Isaac and why? Vers. 5. Because Abraham his father obeied the voice of the Lord, and kept his Ordinances and Com∣mandements, his Statutes and Lawes. Teaching plainely that the holinesse of parents seales vp the Lords fauour not onely to themselues, but to their children also: this cannot raking and scraping together of wealth doe; men vse to say, happy is the childe whose father goeth to the Deuill, a wicked saying; it is rather a comfort to children when they can remember their parents, are, or haue been godly and in the fauour of God, for he louing the stocke will not disregard the branches; they may say as Iacob said, Gen. 32.9. Thou hast beene, or art, the God of my Father, good and gratious to him, shew then mercy to me his seede, according to thy sweete promise. Yea, God is good euen to wicked children of good parents. Gen. 36.7. Esau had riches and outward good things. 1. King. 11.32. When the Lord rent the Kingdome from Solomon for his sinne, yet one Tribe was left for Dauids sake. A no∣table inducement to make Parents to become godly; and if we desire that God should be good to our children after vs, let vs labor to bring our selues within the coue∣nant, and we shall finde that an effectuall meanes to moue God to mercy towards our children for many generati∣ons. Come we to the last words (through the circumcision of Christ) in these words is expressed the meanes how the be∣leeuing Colossians were in Christ circumcised (viz.)
through, or by the circumcision of Christ, in this place wee are not to vnderstand the passiue circumcision, that whereby Christ himselfe was circumcised, but the actiue, that whereby we in him are circumcised and regenerated by his spirit, and we may note and obserue a difference between Iustification & Regeneration or Sanctification, the Apostle speaking of iustification in the Verse before, saith, We haue perfection of righteousnesse in Christ, in him we are complete, not adding any thing further, that that perfection is wrought in vs by Christ: but here spea∣king of regeneration and sanctification, hee saith that in Christ also wee are regenerate, and he expounds his owne meaning, how (namely) through the circumcision of  Christ, through the working of his spirit in vs, whence we see a manifest and plaine difference betweene iustification, and sanctification.There is a manifst diff∣rēce between iustification and sanctifi∣cation. The Papists confound these two, in teaching iustification by holinesse inherent: and I note this to teach vs to take heede of so confounding of them; and know we that iustification is by righteousnesse inhe∣rent in Christ apprehended by faith,  and regeneration and sanctification is wrought in vs by the spirit of Christ in this life,We must take heed we con∣found them not. but in part, and shall bee made perfect in the life to come. VER. 12. In that yee are buried with him through Bap∣tisme, in whom yee are also raysed vp together through the faith of the operation of God which raysed him from the dead. In this verse the Apostle meets with a secret exception that might bee made against his speech in the former verse, on this manner; some might say, though outward circumcision, the cutting away of the fore-skin of the flesh be not now needfull for the beleeuing Colossians, that being proper to the time of the olde Testament, yet they haue need of an outward signe and sacrament, sig∣nifying
and sealing vp vnto them their inward and spiri∣tuall circumcision: this exception the Apostle preuents in this verse, shewing that the Colossians had an outward signe and seale of their inward circumcision (namely) baptisme which by Christ his institution succeeded cir∣cumcision, & that in stead of being circumcised, they were baptized, and so had the outward signe with the thing sig∣nified. Now the Apostle doth not rest in expressing the out∣ward signe of baptisme, but by way of further explicati∣on and declaration of the inward circumcision, and abo∣lishing of the corruption of the beleeuing Colossians, he sets it out, together with the inward things signified by baptisme, and whereof through baptisme they were made partakers, as, First that, through Baptisme was signified and sealed  vp vnto them, and they made partakers of the buriall of Christ. In that yee are buried with him through Baptisme, & Secondly that though Baptisme was signified and sea∣led vp vnto them, and they made partakers of Christ his resurrection in these words: In whom yee are olso raysed vp together. And then followeth the inward means by which their  outward baptisme was effectuall to make them partakers of Christ his buriall and resurrection, (namely) faith through the faith. Which faith is further described by the efficient cause  of it that is the cause working faith in the heart (namely) the power of God, through the faith of the operation of God. And that power and operation of God is further spe∣cified  to bee the same that raysed vp Christ from the dead in the last words, which raysed him up from the dead. Come wee to the particular examination of the wordes  as they are laid downe by the Apostle, and first of these
words. In that yee are buried with him through Bap∣tisme; for the vnderstanding of these wordes, two que∣stions are to be answered. Interpreta∣tion.First, what it is to bee buried with Christ. Secondly, how through Baptisme wee are buried with  him. Answere to the 1.For the First, to bee buried with Christ, is to haue fel∣lowship and communion with Christ in his buriall, to partake with Christ; both in the merite of his buriall, whereby he hath changed the nature of the graue, and taken away the horror of it, and turned it from an house of perdition, to a place of sweet repose, and to partake with Christ in the power of his buriall to bury sinne and naturall corruption in vs. Answere to the 2.For the second question I answere, that wee are buried with Christ through Baptisme two wayes. First in signe and Sacrament onely, for the dipping of the party baptized in the water, and abiding vnder the water for a time, doth represent and seale vnto vs the bu∣riall of Christ, and his abiding in the graue, and of this all are partakers sacramentally. Secondly, wee are buried with Christ through Bap∣tisme, not onely in signe and sacrament, but in deed, and truth, when by the working of his spirit wee are baptized into Christ, & really engrafted into him; for being really and truly made one with Christ, wee are made partakers of the merite and power of his death, buriall and resur∣rection, and all his benefites, as the Apostle plainely teach∣eth, Rom. 6.34.5.6. Know yee not that all wee which haue beene baptized into Iesus Christ, haue beene bapti∣zed into his death? Wee are buried then with him by Baptisme into his death; that like as Christ was raysed vp from the dead by the glory of the father, so wee also should walke in newnesse of life. For if wee be grafted with him to the similitude of his death, euen so shall wee bee to the similitude of his resurrection, knowing this that
our olde man is crucified with him, that the body of sinne might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serue sinne, &c. where he shewes that such as are baptized not onely in signe and sacrament, but truely baptized into Christ, are baptized into his death, buriall and resurrecti∣on, and so are partakers of the merit and power of his death, buriall and resurrection, by the answere to these two questions, wee may come to conceiue the meaning of the Apostle in these wordes to be this, as if he had sayd, in that yee through Baptisme being truely engrafted into Christ, and made one with him, are partakers of the me∣rite and power of his death and buriall, (for his buriall presupposeth his death and the Apostle is so to bee vnder∣stood) to kill and bury sinne and naturall corruption in you. Now these words being thus vnderstood, the words following are after the same manner to bee expounded, onely reading for (in whom) in which with reference to Baptisme, as the original will beare it, and it is more agree∣able to the context. In which Baptisme, and the words so read, the meaning of them is plaine by the former expo∣sition, as if the Apostle had said, in which baptisme you being truly ingrafted into Christ, are partakers of the merite and power of Christ his resurrection, and by that power are raysed vp to newnesse of life. Now here obserue that the Apostle by way of pre∣uention  of an obiection,Baptisme suc∣ceeds in the roome of cir∣cumcision by the institution of Christ. makes knowne that the Colos∣sians had an outward signe and seale of their inward and spirituall circumcision (namely) baptisme, that in stead of being circumcised they were baptized. Hence briefly note we that baptisme succeedes in the roome of circum∣cision, and that circumcision being now abolished,  bap∣tisme is put in place of it by the institution of Christ, and hence wee may haue one ground and warrant to prooue the baptisme of infants, that the baptisme of infants is lawfull and warrantable by the word of God, for circum∣cision being administred to infants in time of the old
Testament, there is no reason why Baptisme succeeding it should not bee administred to them in time of the gos∣pell, vnlesse wee say that the condition of the infants of Christians in time of the new Testament, is worse then of the children of the Iewes, in time of the olde; and that by the comming of Christ, the grace of God is more ob∣scure, & not so ample & large, or lesse testified to vs then it was to them which liued vnder the law, which to say were to cast reproach and contumely on Iesus Christ, and farre be that ftom vs. For concluding the next point wee are to marke that the Apostle speakes here in the time present; Yee are buried with him, &c. Hence we may take vp this conclusion. That Baptisme hath vse after the administration of it, euen throughout the whole life in such as are truely baptised,Baptisme is effectuall throughout the whole life in such as are truly bap∣tized. it is effectuall to the taking away of sinne in all times of life, it seales vp the washing away of all sinnes in all times of life, past, present, and to come. Hence it is that the Apostle Peter, 1. Epist. 3.21. speaking of those who were before baptized, saith Baptisme which now sa∣ueth vs and our Sauiour Christ himselfe extends baptisme in the force and efficacy of it, as well to the time to come as to the time past, Mar. 16.16. Hee that shall beleeue and be baptized shall be saued, the reasons of this. That baptisme is effectuall to the taking away of sinne in all times of life are these two. 1 The foundation or substance of baptisme is the co∣uenant of grace; for in Baptisme God promiseth and co∣uenanteth with the baptized such as are inwardly baptized to be their God, and this couenant is eternall, Isai 54.10. the mountaines shall remoue, and the hils shall fall down, but my mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my peace fall away saith the Lord, that hath compassion on thee. Ierem. 32.40. I will make saith the Lord an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will neuer turne away from them to doe them good, but I wil
put my feare in their harts, that they shall not depart from me, therefore the force and efficacy of baptisme is not limited to any time, but is of force so long as the couenant is of force. Secondly, baptisme is the sacrament of incision of in∣grafting  into Christ, sealing vp our setting into Christ, which is onely once neuer after to bee done againe, and therefore the force of it continueth in all times: for if it did not, then we should haue another ingrafting into Christ, and an other seale on the same, but because wee are once engrafted into Christ, and after nourished in him, therfore we are once onely baptized, and many times receiue the sacrament of the Supper, and that plainelie proues, that the force of baptisme is extended to the whole life of man, to seale vp the taking away of all sinnes, both originall & actuall, in regarde of the guilte and punishment of them. This for the vse of it may discouer the error of the  Papists, who teach that Baptisme takes away all sinnes that goe before it, but sinnes committed after, are not thereby taken away, but must be taken away by theit deuised sacrament of penance,Confutation of the popish sacrament of penance. a doctrine directly oppo∣site to that which I haue now deliuered and proued, and such a deuise as destroies the true vse and nature of Bap∣tisme, yea such as is full of much discomfort we are to re∣nounce it. For a second vse consider we the comfort of the truth  deliuered, it is full of sweet comfort to all such as are in∣wardly baptisedComfort to all that finde themselues inwardli baptized. (namely) such as are carefull to performe that part of the couenant made betweene God and them, that belongs to them (that is) to repent of their sinnes, and to beleeue in Christ, to them it is full of heauenly comfort. For why? is baptisme effectuall to seale vp the washing away of all sinnes in all times of life? then in all times of trouble and distresse: especially in time of trouble and affliction of minde and conscience haue re∣course
and goe with speed to thy Baptisme, there thou shalt finde comfort, thou shalt finde that God hath there∣in sealed vp vnto thee his loue and fauour, and his euer∣lasting couenant of grace, and hath promised to bee thy God for euer, and he will not faile of his promise. Men vse often to looke on deedes and willes, and such like writings, that they may be resolued in matters of doubt: Looke then often on the Will of thy heauenly Father, sealed and deliuered to thee in thy Baptisme, and thou shalt bee better resolued in the middest of thy greatest doubts; thou shalt there find that thou being once en∣tred into couenant with God, no euill in thee can driue God from his promise, but that he will surely performe it, and be thy God for euer, euen good and gracious vnto thee, in the forgiuenes of all thy sinnes, yea, that in thy Baptisme was sealed vp vnto thee the pardon of all thy sinnes, euen of that sinne that happily now troubleth thy mind and conscience, and that is a matter of singu∣lar comfort, and often to be thought on by all such as are truely baptized, and let none but such take holde of this comfort, to them onely it belongs, from these words  of the Apostle we are farther taught. Such as are truly and in∣wardly bapti∣zed are parta∣kers of the merite and power of Christ his death, buriall and resurre∣ction.That as many as are truely and inwardly baptised, are by baptisme made partakers of the merit, and power of Christ his death, buriall and resurrection, the Apostle saith; through Baptism they were buried with Christ, &c. and further proofe of this we heard before out of Rom: 6.3.4.5.6. &c. together with the ground of it (name∣ly) our vnion with Christ that we being made one with Christ, haue communion and fellowship with him in his death, buriall and resurrection, and hereby first we may see the wickednesse of that Popish distinction,Confutation of a Popish distinction. that bap∣tisme  is for remission of sinne, life and sanctification; but confirmation by laying on the hands of the Bishop, which they hold also to be a sacrament, is for strength to fight against spirituall enemies, as though there were a∣ny
sanctification, without strength to fight against spiri∣tuall enemies, and as though when wee haue comfort from baptisme against terrors and temptations, wee are not strengthned and encouraged to fight against them, it is a most absurd and foolish distinction, I leaue them, and for the vse of this doctrine to our selues. Is it so that such as are inwardly baptized, are by their  baptisme,Triall, whe∣ther wee bee inwardly baptised or no. made partakers of the merite and power of Christ his death, buriall and resurrection; then let vs here∣by examine our selues, if wee find our selues dead and buried with Christ, wee are inwardly baptized, but if it bee otherwise, wee are not; and that we may know when wee are dead and buried with Christ, remember wee the condition of such as are dead and buried, they neyther see nor heare, they haue no sense nor feeling of any thing;How wee may know that we are dead and bu∣ried wlth Christ. if it bee thus with vs in respect of sinne, when the Diuell, and our owne corruption doe allure vs to sinne; if we bee not moued to it, but are as men dead in regard of it; wee are then through baptisme dead and buried with Christ: but if when wee are moued to sinne, wee haue hearts rea∣dy to yeeld vnto it: for example, when wee are tickled, with the lust of vncleannesse, if our heartes bee ready to consent, and our bodies to execute the same; if when wee are prouoked by iniury our hearts be presently enflamed with anger, our tongues ready to shoot out bitter words; we are not yet through Baptisme partakers of the power of Christ his death and buriall, and consequently we can haue no comfort by our baptisme, & let vs know it for a truth, that without inward Baptisme wee haue no part in Christ, outward baptisme without the inward is but the marke of a foole that makes a vow, and afterwards breaks it, as saith the Preacher, Eccles. 5.3. Let me now adde one thing to this point, by way of further vse and application of it (namely) this, it being so that as many as are truely baptized, are by baptisme made partakers of the merite and power of Christ his death, bu∣riall
and resurrection, and wee are hereby to examine our selues, let vs further know that wee are often to ex∣amine our selues vpon euery occasion, wee are to looke  to our baptisme, to see whether we through baptisme, be dead, buried, and raised vp with Christ, or no, and espe∣cially then, when the sacrament of Baptisme is admini∣stred in our sight;We are often to trie whe∣ther wee bee inwardly baptized or no, and essen∣tially when the sacrament of Baptisme is administred in our sight. the administration of that Sacrament must be a visible Sermon to put vs in mind of this duetie, euen then are wee to enter into our owne hearts, and to examine our selues, it is therefore a great fault in such as depart and goe away from the publike assembly (hauing no vrgent extraordinary occasion) when the Sacrament of Baptisme comes to bee administred, as it is a bewitch∣ing, and an inchantment of Sathan to hold such as haue Iesus Christ in liuely manner described in their sight, and crucified before them, in the preaching of the word and administration of the sacraments, to hold them from yeel∣ding obedience to the truth,Reproofe of such as depart and goe from the assembly when the Sa∣cament of Baptisme is administred. as the Apostle sayth, Gal. 5.1. so doubtlesse it is a subtlety and sleight of the Diuell, as much as possibly hee can to keepe men from seing Christ crucified before them. From seeing the death of Christ in liuely manner set before them, either in the preaching of the word; or administration of the Sacraments; and to this end he labours to fasten vpon their mindes this con∣ceit, that Baptisme onely concernes the little children that are to bee baptized, and some few others, & nothing at all belongs to them but that they may depart the con∣gregation at their pleasure, and without question he hath poysoned the minds of many with this pleasing conceit, and it is very needfull that this cunning working of Sa∣than should be discouered vnto vs, and wee put in minde of this fault, that we may learne to reforme it, and to this end know we. That Baptisme is a publike worke of the whole con∣gregation, and euery one of vs hath a part in that worke, in witnessing the worke done by the the Minister, in ap∣prouing
the same by one consent of the spirit of grace, by consenting in prayer and thanksgiuing, yea the whole body of the congregation ought with knowledge of Gods couenant, & ioy of a member to be added to the church, to addresse themselues to that worke; yea euery one of vs ought particularly to take profite by it, as oft as wee see it administred, we are to call to mind our owne Baptisme, and see whether the Lord hath beene powerfull through that to kill, and bury sinne in vs, and to raise vs vp to new∣nesse of life or no, and to remember the vow euery one of vs made in Baptisme, this is our duty, and these excellent vses ought wee to make of that holy Sacrament, whenso∣euer wee see it administred; therefore let no man thinke it a matter arbitrary and indifferent, that he may eyther stay or goe away at the time of the administration of it: no, no it is our duety to attend it, and it is of excellent and profi∣table vse to euery one of vs, and it is the subtlety of Sathan to make vs lightly regarde it. I passe on to further matter from these wordes of the Apostle, buried with him through Baptisme, &c. there is yet offered one thing more to be considered of vs, & that of excellent vse. Hence we are further taught, that such as are engraf∣ted  into Christ through Baptisme, are so nearely conioi∣ned with him, as that they are dead and buried with him, and raysed vppe together with him; yea, what Christ did as mediatour, they did with him as the members of his body;Such as are ingrafted into Christ throgh Baptisme, are so nearely conioyned with him, as that the things done by Christ as Me∣diator, they did with him as the mem∣bers of his body. Hence it is that the Apostle, 1. Corinthians 12.12. (which is worthy to bee obser∣ued of vs) giues the name of Christ to all true beleeuers in Christ, he stiles them ioyntly together being one misti∣call body by the name and title of Christ, so is Christ (that is) the Church of Christ; and he giues the reason of it in the verse following, because by one spirit they are all bap∣tized into one body, whether Iewes or Grecians, bond or free, and haue beene all made to drinke into one spirite,
and they are made one body, vnder one and the same head Christ Iesus; and hence it is that the Apostle, Gal. 2.19. saith he was crucified with Christ, and in the thirde Chapter of this Epistle, Verse 1. If yee then bee risen with Christ, seek those thinges which are aboue, as if he had said, if yee bee made one with Christ, and as members of Christ be risen vp with him, seeke those things which are aboue, where Christ fitteth at the right hand of God: by all which places & many others that might be broght it is very cleare, that so neare is the vnion and coniuncti∣on of Christ and his true members ingrafted into him through Baptisme, that what Christ did as mediatour, they did with him, when hee died they died with him, when he was buried they were buried with him, when he rose againe from death to life, they were raysed with him. First, this may serue as a ground of excellent comfort  to all such as are truly ingrafted into Chtist by Baptisme,Comfort to all such ar are truly ingraf∣ted into Christ by Baptisme. for why? consider it, is it so that when Christ died, they that are engrafted into him died with him, when he was buried, they were buried with him, when he rose againe, they were raysed with him? what then shall disappoint them, what then shall depriue them, of the fruite, the bene∣fite, and the comfort of Christ his death, buriall, and re∣surrection; surely, not all the power of hell is able to do it; Let the Papists say what they will, that iustifying faith by which wee holde the merite of Christ his obedience, actiue and passiue, may be vtterly lost, which they are ne∣uer able to proue, yet they will neuer be so shamelesse as to say wee can bee frustrated and disappointed of the fruit, benefite and comfort of that which wee haue alrea∣dy done together with Christ, can a member of Christ die with Christ, be buried with him, and raysed vp with him, and finde no benefite nor comfort by Christ his death, buriall and resurrection, he dying, being buried, and raysed vp for the good and comfort of his members;
it is not possible, as many as are truely ingrafted into Christ, died with Christ when hee died, were buried with Christ when hee was buried, and were raised with Christ when he was raised, and therefore cannot bee disapointed of the benefit of his death, buriall, and resurrection, but shall be sure to finde the comfort in those deeds of Christ, both in life and death; yea we being once set into Christ, and made one with Christ, our hope of heauen is so sure and certaine that we are said now to sit with him in hea∣uen already, they are the very words of the Apostle Ephes. 2.6. and that is a ground of sweete comfort for all such as finde themselues engrafted into Christ through Bap∣tisme. Againe it being so, that so neare is the vnion betweene  Christ & his mēbers, that when Christ died they died with him, when he was buried they were buried with him, when he rose from the dead they were raised with him. If euer we looke for comfort by Christ, here must be the ground of it that we are dead & buried, & raised with Christ;If euer wee looke for com¦fort by Christ the ground of it must be this that we are dead, and bu∣ried, and rai∣sed vp with Christ. for al our comfort is from our vnion with Christ, and as many as are truely vnited with him are dead, buried, and raised vp with him, and therefore if euer we looke for comfort by him, we must finde our selues dead, buried, and raised vp with him: through the subtilty of Satan many deceiue themselues, they thinke it sufficient if they can say, Christ died for them, and they are perswaded Christ shed his bloud for them, though they neuer finde themselues cru∣cified, dead, buried and raised vp with Christ. But we must know that this is not sufficient,  this is not to build our comfort on a sure ground; no will some say, is not the merit of Christ his Death, a sure ground to build vpon. I answer,  yes, for those to whom it appertaines, and they are onely Christ his members, who were crucified with him: and if we would finde and bee assured of true comfort in Christ, we must not rest in the fruit and merit
of his death, but wee must goe a step further and find our selues crucified and dead with him. If you aske how a man shall know this: the Apostle hath taught vs,  Rom. 6.6.7. When the old man (that is) our naturall corruption is crucified with Christ; as a ma∣lefactor executed ceaseth from theft murder, and the like, so certainely, if thou bee crucified with Christ, thou shalt finde thy selfe to cease from thy old sinnes. And let this be euer the ground of thy comfort in Christ, that thou art crucified with Christ: euen a wicked reprobate may fancy to himselfe that the merit of Christ his death be∣longs to him, but can neuer goe thus farre to finde him∣selfe dead and buried with Christ: if then wee would goe beyond a reprobate, one that is damned in hell. Let vs not content our selues with a bare notion that Christ died for vs, but let vs labour to finde our selues dead, buried, and raised vp with Christ: and that onely will assure vs, that wee through baptisme are ingrafted into Christ, and made one with him, and that all the strength of Hell shall neuer be able to make a diuision between Christ and vs, and that will bee vnto vs a sure ground of lasting comfort: it fol∣loweth, (through the faith of the operation of God) in these words the Apostle sets downe, as wee haue shewed, the inward meanes by which outward Baptisme was effe∣ctuall to the Colossians, and they made pertakers of Christ his buriall and resurrection, (namely) faith, and that is de∣scribed by the efficient cause of it, (namely) the actuall working of the power of God. For the power of God is two fold;Interpreta∣tion. absolute, by which he is able to doe more then he will; and actuall equall to his will, and that power we are heere to vnderstand, and the meaning of the words is briefly this, through faith wrought in you by the actu∣all power of God. Obserue we hence in the last place, that Baptisme is ef∣fectuall  to seale vp the grace of God, touching washing a∣way of sinnes and regeneration onely in such as beleeue
it is not the outward act of baptisme that doth conferre and giue grace without faith. The Apostle saith plainly,Baptisme is effectuall to seale vp Gods grace onely in such as be∣leeue. Yee are buried with Christ through Baptisme, and that through Faith. Yea, the proposition is generall, that the Sacraments without faith doe not actually conferre grace Ephes. 5.26. The Apostle saith, that Christ sanctifieth his Church by the washing of water, and hee there staies not, but addes further through the word, (that is) through the word of promise beleeued: for indeed, the word it selfe is not as a phisicall or naturall instrument containing grace, but doth onely signifie the good wil of God to his chosen, and being mixed with faith is profitable, and it is the pow∣er of God to saluation onely to them that beleeue, Rom. 1.16. Therefore the Sacraments which are but the word of God made visible, doe not giue grace by the outward act, but through faith in those that rightly receiue them, they are effectuall to signifie and seale vp the grace of God. Vse. First, this may discouer vnto vs the errour of the  Papists,Discouerie of the error of the Papists touching the force and ef∣fect of the Sa∣craments. who teach that the Sacraments of the new Testa∣stament conferre grace, ex opere operato, yea, they say that the Sacrament of Baptisme doth it selfe wash away sinnes by force and vertue of the worke and word done, and said in the Sacrament; and for this they alledge Act. 22.16. Arise and be baptised, and wash away thy sinnes in calling on the name of the Lord. Which text if it bee well obser∣ued makes directly against them; for to the Sacrament of Baptisme is heere ioined calling on the name of the Lord, which is a fruit of faith, and whereunto saluation is pro∣mised, Rom. 10.13. It is therefore a meere deuice of their owne, that Baptisme or the Supper of the Lord doe con∣ferre and giue grace by the very worke done: wee are to renounce it as an vntruth and Popish errour. And for the vse of the point to our selues, is it so that  the Sacraments doe not actually giue grace, we must then looke when we pertake of the Sacraments, that wee bring
faith with vs,When wee come to par∣take of the Sacrament. we must look that we bring faith with vs. the Sacrament doe not worke faith, but seale it vp where it is wrought, and if faith be not all rea∣dy in vs, they seale vp nothing but iudgement vnto vs; yea, wee must mixe the hearing of the word and praier with faith, or else our hearing will bee vnprofitable, and our praiers but lip-labour and abominable, and hence it is that men finde no comfort in the promise of the Gospell in time of trouble, and hence also is it that men by the threatnings of Gods Law are more hardned and the word becomes a sauour of death to their deepe con∣demnation; labour we therefore to beleeue and to mix the word and Sacraments with faith, or else the Sacra∣ment shall be a seale of thy damnation, and the word preached and heard by thee shall aggrauate thy iudge∣ment. These words (though the faith of the operation of God) vnderstood as before they were expounded, doe further afford vnto vs this point of instruction. That true faith by which wee are vnited to Christ, and made one with him, and haue fellowship with him in his death, buriall, and resurrection is the effect of the migh∣tie working power of God; True faith in Chirst is not in vs by nature, nor begotten by any power or strength of ours, but is onely wrought in vs by the powerfull and al∣mighty hand of God.True faith by which we are knit vnto Christ & haue fellowshippe with him is wrought in vs by the power∣full hand of God. Therefore the Apostle heere cals it the faith of the operation of God, or the faith of Gods power; true faith is not onely the meere free gift of God, Phil. 1.29. to you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely yee should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake, as all o∣ther graces are; but it is so wonderfull and so supernatu∣rall a gift and grace of God as it is wrought by the excee∣ding greatnesse of his power, by the working of his al∣mighty power: as the Apostle saith, Ephes. 1.19. That yee may know what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power towards vs, which beleeue according to the wor∣king of his mighty power, and the reason of it, that faith
in Christ is so wonderful and so supernaturall a gift is this Because it is not onely aboue nature corrupted,  but e∣uen aboue nature created, it was not in the pure nature in time of mans innocency before the fal, because then there was no neede of it, other gifts and graces were and so o∣ther gifts and graces are now onely renewed in those that are effectually called by the working of Gods spirit, they were before in nature created, but saith in Christ was not so; true faith in Christ is first wrought in such as are in their corrupt state and condition, and therefore is a most wonderful, heauenly and supernaturall worke of the mighty power of God. Let vs then from hence bee admonished to take heede  we deceiue not our selues; let no man fancy to himselfe that faith is in his owne power, that hee can at his owne time and pleasure beleeue in Iesus Christ,They deceiue themselues who thinke they can at their owne time and plea∣sure beleeue in Christ. heerein the De∣uill doth delude many thousands of poore soules in the world; hee perswades them that either already they be∣leeue and haue faith, and that easily conceiued without feeling of any working of the mighty power of God, yea, some are so besotted and blinded by the subtilty of Satan, that they thinke they haue beleeued in Christ euer since they were borne, and neuer doubted of Gods mer∣cy; or else if this slight be discouered and be two palpable and their eies be opened to see it, then he perswades with them, that though now they beleeue not, yet they may heereafter when they will, and that it is an easie matter to beleeue in Christ, and in their owne power to beleeue when they list; yea, that they may take hold of the mer∣cie of God, and merit of Christ, at the very last houre of their life, and with this pleasing conceit he deceiues many and drawes many a poore soule downe to perdition: let vs therefore learne this truth, that true faith in Christ is a wonderfull worke of Gods power, and make vse of it to oppose it against the subtill and cunning slight of Satan, going about to perswade to the contrary, and that we may
be yet further resolued and setled in this truth, and armed against the subtilty of Satan in this respect, consider wee but this one thing, that if true faith in Christ were in a mans owne power, then certainely neuer any of them whose hearts are pressed downe with the burden of sinne, and the anger of God for the same would despaire, but would take hold of Gods mercy. Now lamentable experience sheweth the contrary that at such time as some are brought to a sight of their sinns & a thorow sense and feeling of Gods anger against them for the same, they cannot then beleeue in Christ, nor take hold of Gods mercy by any meanes, it is the property of the cursed nature of man at such a time,Note. as that to blas∣pheme God, and to despaire of Gods mercy; and there∣fore it is not in mans power to beleeue when he list. Looke on the example of Iudas, did not hee, when hee saw the greatnesse of his sinne, and Gods hand was heauy vpon him, did not hee in a hellish horror of conscience and fearefull desperation lay hands vpon himselfe: if faith had been in his owne power would he haue done so? cer∣tainly he would not, let then all such as now in the securi∣ty of their hearts (neither seeing, nor feeling the waight of their sinnes) thinke that faith is in their owne power, and that they may beleeue in Christ when they will: consider it, that when Gods hand shall be heauy vpon them, & the Lord shal let them see the greatnesse of their sinnes, that happily then they may seeke for faith and neuer finde it; yea, it may be that if then one would giue them ten thou∣sand worlds, they shall not be able to find any comfort in Christ; let them thinke vpon it, and learne to know that true faith in Christ, is not in a mans owne power, but it is onely the worke of Gods mighty power, and neuer rest till they finde that the Lords hand hath wrought vpon them, and in them the wonderfull supernaturall worke of faith, and that we be not deceiued in this point of so great weight and consequence, our saluation depending vpon it;
(for without true faith in Christ there is no hope of salua∣tion) let vs neuer rest till we find such a faith wrought in vs, as is able euen to breake thorow the sence and feeling of our owne sinnes, and Gods anger, and to take hold on Gods mercy, and the merit of Christ for our comfort, and then wee may bee sure that faith is wrought in vs by the mighty and powerfull worke of Gods spirit. Againe, is it so, that true faith in Christ is the worke  of the mighty power of God, then let all such as finde it truely wrought in them,Comfort for all such as find true faith tru∣ly wrought in them. herein comfort themselues; for certainely faith being wrought by the power of God, the same power shall euer preserue it from failing, and beeing vtterly lost what power shall be able to vanquish and ouer∣master the power of God, not all the power of heauen, earth, or hell, can bee able to doe it, and hence it is, that true faith neuer vtterly faileth; this comes to passe through the power of God, which in all true members of Christ, is a continued power, working strength and stabi∣lity in them, and neuer wholly interrupted,Note. it is not any vertue or excellency in faith it selfe that makes it of neuer failing continuance; it is changeable in it selfe, and no∣thing in it selfe is vnchangeable but God: but it is the power of God euer working in some measure in the mem∣bers of Christ, that makes faith not to faile; hence it is, that the Apostle 1. Peter 1.5. saith, that wee beeing be∣gotten to a liuely hope by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead, &c. are kept by faith vnto saluation: but how? by any power in faith it selfe. No, but by the power of God. The words are very significant, we are kept or garded (for so the originall word signifieth) as with a strong garrison, true faith wrought in vs by the power of God, is fenced and fortified by the same power of God a∣gainst all hostility, so as no enemy of our saluation can breake in vpon it to ouercome it, it may be much weake∣ned and lessened in the measure, and the Lord may suffer it to bee ecclipsed and ouershadowed with some grieuous
temptation; but his power that hath begotten it, will ne∣uer suffer it vtterly to faile: no, the mighty power of God being the efficient working cause of faith, giues assurance to true beleeuers that no aduersary power whatsoeuer can euer preuaile against their faith, though the Lord do some∣times afflict them grieuously; yet I may bee bold to say, that the stroake of his owne hand cannot preuaile against their faith, because he will not; for his working power is onely equall to his will, it goes not beyond it. Hence it was that Iob said 13. Chap. 15. vers. Though the Lord should kill him, yet he would beleeue in him; doubtlesse not boasting of any strength in himselfe▪ but being assured that his faith should euer bee supported by the mighty power of God, and not by any stroake of Gods hand: no, not by the greatest of all, death it selfe; be vtterly quelled and extinguished: and vpon this ground may all such as haue true faith wrought in them, build their assurance that their faith shall neuer faile, nor be vtterly lost, because it is wrought by the mighty power of God, and by the same power it shall euer be preserued. And let all such as finde true faith in Christ truly wrought in them, herein comfort themselues. Come wee to the last words of this verse, wherein this working power of God is specified to be the same that rai∣sed vp Christ from the dead, for that is the meaning of the Apostle in these words,Interpreta∣tion. (which raised him from the dead) as if he had said who by that working power of his raised vp Christ from the dead, the words are cleare, and neede no further exposition; onely lest wee stumble at some places of Scripture which seeme not to agree with this, that God raised vp Christ from the dead, in that it is said, Christ rai∣sed vp himselfe, Iohn 10.18. No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe. I haue power to lay it down, and haue power to take it againe. Know we that the word (God) in this place is to be taken essentially, not per∣sonally, For the whole Trinity, and not for the first person
God the Father, and the externall workes of the Trnity are vndeuided. God the Father raised vp Christ, Christ as God raised vp himselfe, And God the holy Ghost raised him vp: And so there is good agreement of this place and other places of Scripture. Now first, we are to marke that the Apostle specifying the power of God by the effect of it, he makes choise of this effect rather then any other, the raising of Christ from the dead; he saith not through the faith of the operation of God which created the world, but through the faith of the operation of God which raised Christ from the dead; hence we may gather this conclusion. That the al-sufficient mighty power of God was won∣derfully  declared in raising Christ from the deade.The al-suffi∣cient & migh∣tie power of God ap∣peared in rai∣sing vp Christ from the dead. In the resurrection of Christ did appeare the exceeding greatnesse of Gods power, the Apostle doth plainely a∣uouch it, Ephes. 1.20. What is the exceeding greatnesse of his mighty power towardes vs which hee wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead. Rom. 1.4. The Apostle saith, Christ was declared mightily to bee the Sonne of God, touching the spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead. Now the reason  of it, that Gods power was so excee∣dingly declared in raising Christ from the dead is this, be∣cause the humiliation of Christ by death was exceeding great: neuer any was, nor could bee so compassed about with the bounds or sorrowes of death, as they are called, Act. 2.24. as he was for a time. Therefore in the loosing of those bounds there must needes appeare the greatest pow∣er that euer was, for the strongest bonds require the migh∣tiest power to loose them. Now the Lord hath made it knowne that in raising vp Christ from the dead,  he declared his mighty power that we should make vse of it: & surely we are thus to take pro∣fit
by it when we are in the greatest distresse, either of bo∣dy or minde,When we are in the greatest distresse of bo∣dy or minde we are to con∣sider if the mightie pow∣er of God in raising vppe Christ from the dead as a special meanes to strengthen vs. wee are then to looke at the power of the Lord in raising vp Christ from the dead; and to consider that the Lord thus shewed foorth his power in loosing the bonds of death, when it seemed all hope was gone, and when death seemed to triumph ouer Christ, and that will raise vp our fainting hearts and fill them with comfort in our greatest extremities; for indeede though the Lords power support vs in time of some great distresse, otherwise we should vtterly faint and fall flat vnder it, yet at such a time as that we are not able, through our infirmity and weakenesse, clearely to see and perceiue that working power of the Lord, we are therefore to lift vp our eies and to looke at the mighty power of the Lord appearing ma∣nifestly in raising vp Christ from the dead, and setting him at his right hand in heauen, and that will be a meanes to confirme and strengthen vs in our hope and depen∣dance on God at all times: wee know that if a sicke man can call to minde any one that was handled as he now is, and yet recouering his health, it comforts him much; in like manner if wee in time of trouble and distresse can but remember the example of some meere man on whom the Lord hath shewed his mercy and power in his deliuerance, be it Iob or any other, Iam. 5.11. the Apostle saith, Ye haue heard of the patience of Iob, and haue knowne what ende the Lord made, it is a notable meanes to comfort, and to strengthen our hope, much more will it comfort vs if wee set before vs the mighty power of the Lord in raising Christ from the dead: and therefore let vs euer in time of  great distresse, looke at the greatnesse of Gods power ma∣nifested in Christ, and that will comfort vs.Gods power manifested in raising Christ from the dead giues vs assu∣rance that wee shall not bee left in graue. Yea, we are thus to consider of the mighty power of the Lord in raising Christ from the dead, that he being raised who was bound with such strong bonds of death: surely we shall not be left in graue, the Lord raised Christ when he was dead and laid in the graue; therefore an easie mat∣ter
is it for him, when wee are dead and and laid in our gaues to raise vs, if he raised him with his whole hand, he can and will raise vs with his little finger which is an excel∣lent comfort to be thought on by all true beleeuers. Obserue further, that the Apostle saith, Not raised  from the graue, but from the dead; whence it is cleare, that Christ descended into the state of the dead:Christ des∣cended into the state of the dead. hee was among the dead, that as the Apostle saith, Rom. 14.9. hee might be Lord both of the dead, and of the quicke: and the comfort of this is deliuered in the verse before. Rom. 14.8. That whether wee liue, we liue vnto the Lord, or whether we die, we die vnto the Lord,  whether wee liue therefore or die, wee are the Lords.True belee∣uers whether they liue or die, are still the Lords. As many as truly be∣leeue in Christ, though they be dead, yet still they are the Lords; yea their dead bodies are still within the couenant and still conioined to Christ, which is a sweete comfort vnto them. VER. 13. And yee which were dead in sinnes, and in the vncircumcision of your flesh, hath hee quickened together with him, forgiuing you all your tres∣passes. This verse as it hath relation to the generall drift of the Apostle in this Chapter, it containes an other argu∣ment to proue all sufficiency of saluation to bee found in Christ, and nothing out of him to be needfull, the ar∣gument is this, You beleeuing Colossians are quickned together with Christ, hauing in him free remission of all your sinnes, therefore hee is most sufficient to saluation, you neede not eyther circumcision or any thing else out of him. That is, the respect of this verse, to the generall purpose of the Apostle.
Now more specially it containes a further explication and declaration of their raysing vp together with Christ, spoken of in the Verse before, and that in regard of the power of Christ his resurrection in them; the Apostle therein in this Verse sets downe their raysing vp with Christ in another phrase and forme of speech, that they were partakers of the power of Christ his rising, to the quickning of them, that the Lord had quickned them together with Christ, and this their quickning is further amplified and set before them by their state and condi∣tion, in which they were before that quickning, by their state in which they were by nature; that they were deade, and the Apostle doth further explane himselfe, what man∣ner of death he meant (namely) not a corporall, but a spi∣rituall death, euen a death in sinne, and the vncircumcisi∣on of their flesh. And yee which were dead in sinnes, and in the vncircumcision of the flesh, &c. Then followes in the last words, the ground of their quickning (namely) the free remission of their sinnes, forgiuing you all your trespas∣ses. Come wee to the wordes as they are layde down by the Apostle, and first of these words; And yee which were dead in sinnes, and in the vncircumcision of your flesh, that wee may rightly conceiue these wordes (deade in sins) we must know that they are not to bee vnderstood of corporall death,Interpreta∣tion. the separation of the soule from the body, and that without repentance (as our Sauiour saith, Iohn 8.21. yee shall die in your sinnes, that the Colossi∣ans were so dead in their sinnes, but of spirituall death in sinne, and there is a double spirituall death of such as are yet liuing in respect of sinne, a death to sin, wher∣of the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 6, 2. How shall we that are dead to sinne, yet liue therein, and a death in sinne, and these two are as contrary one to the other, as life & death; For, to bee dead to sinne, is to renounce sinne, and to bee free from the power of sinne, but to be dead in sinne, is to
liue vnder the power of it, to be so vnder sinne as a dead man, is vnder death, and so wee are to vnderstand the A∣postle in this place. And yee which were vnder the power and rule of sinne. By the word (sinnes) we are to vnderstand actuall and originall sinne, yet least some should thinke originall sin excepted, the Apostle addes further (vncircumcision of your flesh) that they were dead in the vncircumcision of the flesh (that is) in originall sinne and corruption: now this the Apostle sets downe by way of allusion, to the fore-skinne of the flesh, and cals it vncircumcision of the flesh, because the vncircumcision of the Gentiles was a signe of their originall sinne inherent in them, as the cir∣cumcision of the Iewes was a signe of the taking away of the same: this then briefly is the sence and meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had said; You that were in the time of your naturall state and condition vnder the power and dominion of sinne both actuall and originall as a dead man is vnder the pow- of death. Now first, hence it is cleare, that men in their naturall  state are so vnder the power of sin, as a dead man is vn∣der the power of death;Men in their naturall all state are so vnder the power of sinne, as a dead man is vnder the power of death. they are not sicke of sinne, or wounded by it, or halfe dead, but starke dead in sinne, they haue neither spirituall life, nor the actions nor fa∣culties of that life; and that this is the condition of men in their naturall state, it is cleare by other forms of speech in Scripture, setting out the state of men before conuersi∣on; as that they are called darkenesse. Ephes. 5.8. not darke or blinde, but euen darkenesse it selfe, giuing vs to vnderstand, that they are nothing but darkenes: Hence they are called flesh, Iohn 3.6. not fleshly, but flesh it selfe and the wisdome that is in them, is enmity against God, Rom, 8, 7. not onely an enemy or contrary, but euen en∣mity
it selfe. Hence it is that the Apostle, 1. Cor. 2.14. sets out the naturall man, not onely to be void of actuall knowledge of God, and of all good things, but voide of all potentiall knowledge of them, hee cannot by any power inherent in himselfe come to the knowledge of them the naturall man (saith he) perceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God; there is his actuall want of know∣ledge touching spirituall things, and least some should say this comes to passe, because hee doth neglect or contemn them, hee neuer labours to know them; the Apostle addes further, neither can hee know them, let him labor neuer so much; there is his want of power to know them, the reason followeth, because they are spiritually discer∣ned, a plaine euidence and proofe, that a man in his natu∣rall state is so vnder sinne, as a dead man is vnder death; sinne holds a naturall man as fast vnder the power of it; as death doth a dead man vnder the power of it, he cannot moue his minde to think, his will to like, and affect any thing that is good; he is as a dead man in respect of any thing that is good: the Scripture is both plaine & plenti∣full  in the proofe of this truth. Confutation of the errors of the Pelagi∣ans and of the Papists.First, this confutes Pelagius and his followers, who holde that by the power of nature, men might come to saluation. Againe this meets with that erronious opinion of the Papists, who say wee may prepare our selues to receiue grace: this is vtterly false, if the doctrine now deliuered bee true, which indeed is most true, grounded on the word of God. For what can a dead man doe to his own quickning and raysing vp from the graue? can hee turne himselfe, and make himselfe fitte to bee raysed vp? wee know it is not possible; take him by the hand, lift him vp, yet hee cannot stand, vnlesse a soule bee put into him, no more can a naturall man moue himselfe towards grace or any good thing, vnlesse he haue spirituall life put into him; No, saith the Papist, hee may giue his free con∣sent
to his owne quickning; how can that bee,  seeing he is dead; why saith, the Papist, albeit man in sinne be dead in the way of grace, yet he liues naturally,  and hath free will in naturall and ciuill actions, which will of his being by grace fortified,  and as it were lifted vp to an higher degree of perfection, can then concutre and worke with grace to faith, and all good workes necessary to life e∣uerlasting. These bee their owne words: Now this is a poore and silly shift, for first, they speake not ad idem,  or to the purpose though it be granted, that a man liues naturally and hath free will in naturall and ciuill things, doth it therupon follow, that he hath power by nature to will or giue consent to his owne conuersion; no, by no meanes it will neuer follow on that ground. Againe, whereas they say that the naturall will being by grace fortified and lifted vp vnto an higher degree of perfection, can then concurre and worke with grace to faith and all good workes necessary to life euerlasting, who sees not that they speake against themselues, for this prooues not that the will of man concurreth by it owne naturall power, which is the point in question, but the cleane contrary, that the will onely by grace is enabled, to will that which is good, and that is the doctrine of our Church, that the will of man in the first act of conuer∣sion is meerely passiue, able to doe nothing; but beeing reuiued and quickned by the Spirit of God, and of vn∣willing made willing, it is then able to choose, will, and effect that which is good. Thus wee see how the Papists entangle themselues in their owne wordes, and fall ere they be aware into that which is against their owne do∣ctrine, to leaue them to vanish in their owne speculati∣ons, and for the vse of this to our selues. Is it so, that men in their naturall state are euen dead  in sinne,Such as be in their naturall state haue no cause to bee proud and to be lift vp with an high conceite of themselues what cause then haue naturall men or women such as haue no testimony of true conuersion, but can witnesse if they deale truely with themselues that they
neuer felt any true change in themselues, but still are the same that they haue beene heretofore. What cause I say haue they that are in that state, to swell in pride, and to be lift vp with an high conceit of themselues, admit they haue excellent naturall parts of body and minde, as wit, capacity, iudgement, strength, beauty, and they haue riches, honours, or other outward good things, yet surely they may hence see that, if they bee in their natural con∣dition, they are as a dead corps that is trimmed & stucke with so many goodly flowers: yea the consideration of their naturall condition may giue them iust cause in stead of bearing their heads aloft, and looking bigge, to droope, and to hang downe their heades; yea to shedde riuers of teares, in bewailing their misery; for all their excellent ornaments and abilities are stained and defiled by their owne filthinesse as the Apostle sayth, Tit. 1.15. to those that are defiled and vnbelieuing is nothing pure, euen their mindes and consciences are defiled; yea which is a further degree of misery, their good actions, such as are good in their kind, and commanded of God, by them are defiled, they are to them but as a stinking sauour that comes from a filthy dead carrion; if this were well consi∣dered it would pull downe the pride and peacockes fea∣thers of many, and stirre them vp to vse all good means to hasten out of this miserable condition. And let mee not passe by one further vse of this point. Discouery of the cause why the word preached is nothing pro∣fitable to some.It being so, that men in their naturall state are vnder sin as a dead man is vnder death, no maruell then though many that are present in the congregation, when the worde is preached, haue no eares to heare it with profit; sound a trumpet in a dead mans eare, and he heares it not, so is it with naturall men, they are as dead men, and let the Preacher cry out and lift vp his voice like a trumpet, Esay 58. they are no more mooued by the worde, either by the comforts or threats of it, then the dead bodies that lye in
the graues vnder their feet, vnlesse it please God to put life into them, and let as many as haue eares to heare with profit and comfort, blesse God for the same, and giue him the glory of that great mercy. The next thing we are to marke in these words is this. The Apostle speaking in the time past (yee which were dead in sinnes, &c.) signifying that the Colossians had been so, but now were not. Hence wee may gather this con∣clusion. That the chosen of God such as belong to Gods electi∣on,  before their conuersion are in the same estate with the wicked reprobate,Gods chosen before their conuersion are in the same state with the re∣probate in re∣garde of bon∣dage vnder sinne. not in regard of election and Gods pur∣pose, for so there is a difference betweene them and the wicked euen before their calling, they are then beloued of God, as such as are only knowne to him to be in the num∣ber of his chosen, and afterwards to bee called, but before conuersion in regard of bondage vnder sin, they are in the same estate with the wicked, they haue no more power to think, wil or affect any good thing than the wiked. Eph. 2.1.2.3. the Apostle describing them in their naturall con∣dition, in the end of the third verse saith, and were by na∣ture the children of wrath, as well as others. 1. Cor. 6.11. such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are san∣ctified, but ye are iustified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of our God. The reason of this truth is plaine, namely this; Because all both elect and reprobate are borne in the same estate,  the elect haue no priuiledge aboue the repro∣bate in regard of birth, but are conceiued and borne in sins as well as they, therefore till it please God to call and con∣uert them, they are in respect of sinne, in the same state;  therefore hence we learne the benefite and comfort of ef∣fectuall calling, that your calling out of your natural con∣dition, is a great mercy of God,Our calling out of our naturall con∣dition is aspe∣ciall mercy of God. before that wee lie wal∣lowing in sinne, and pleasing our selues in a course of sinne; yea, wee haue no mind to any thing that is good;
we are in the same state with the wicked & such as shall be damned; this then is a sweet meditation, when wee can truely call to mind, that we were sometimes in the same state with the wicked, but now are not; yea, this is more comfortable then to thinke on election or redemption by Christ; for this giues vs assurance of our election and redemption, 2. Pet. 1.10. giue diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if yee doe these things; yee shall neuer fall; the fore it is most sweet and comfortable when we can truely say, wee were sometimes thus or thus giuen ouer to sinne; but now are not, and especially when wee can truely say, so in respect of our best pleasing sinne, that wee were sometimes helde vnder the power and tyranny of that sinne, but now are not, though strength and ability bee not wanting for the practise of it, yet now wee haue no pleasure in it, wee striue against it, and wee auoide occasions leading vnto it; if wee bee able to say thus, that is a comfortable thing indeed. Againe, for a second vse, is it so that the chosen of God before their conuersion and effectuall calling are in the same state with the reprobate in regard of bondage vnder sinne, then let all such as are effectually called be thankefull to God for so great a mercy,All that are effectually called are to b thankfull to God for that great mercy. in pulling them with his mighty hand out of that miserable condition, and to this end, let them often call to mind their former con∣dition, and that will stirre them vp to thankefulnesse, no doubt this is one cause, why the Lord will haue a remnāt of originall corruption to remaine in the most regenerate during the time of this life,Note. that the sense of that with griefe, and desire to bee loosed from it, may put them in remembrance in what state they were before they gotte life in Iesus Christ; let vs therefore by this Monitor, that is lodged with vs, be put in mind of our duety: let vs of∣ten call to mind our former miserable bondage vnder sin, then the life wee haue gotten in Christ, will bee sweeter, and wee shall bee stirred vppe to bee more thankefull
to GOD for the same. The next thing to bee considered, is the phrase and forme of speech here vsed by the Apostle, setting out the originall corruption of the Colossians; he calles it vncir∣cumcision of the flesh, alluding to the foreskinne of the flesh, from this forme of speech: occasion is giuen to speake of the extent and spreading of originall corruption, that it is as a skin spread ouer the heart, and ouer all the powers of the soule; but of that wee haue already spoken, verse 11. onely that I will obserue from this phrase shalbe this; In that the Apostle cals originall corruption vncir∣cumcision  of the flesh, which was but a signe of it, wee may see it is no strange and vnusuall thing in the Scripture to put downe the name of the signe for the thing signified by it;It is no strāge thing in scrip∣ture to put downe the name of the signe for the thing signified by it. this manner of speaking is very frequent in the word of God; wee finde circumcision caled the coue∣nant, Ge. 17.14. which was but the signe of the couenant, and the paschall Lambe the Passeouer. Exod. 12.11. which was but a signe of it; and so the bread and wine in the sa∣crament of the Lords Supper, are said to be the body and bloud of Christ, which are but visible signes of his body and bloud, and the reason of this is, because together with the outward signes, the things signified are truly offered,  there is a sacramentall vnion betweene the signe and the thing signified, together with the signe, doth God truely offer the thing signified, wee must therefore take heed we abuse not the outward signs of the sacraments: the abuse  of them reacheth to the thing signified by them,We must take heede wee a∣buse not the outward signs of the Sacra∣ment, the a∣buse of them is very dange∣rous. euen the body and bloud of Christ. And hence it is that the Apo∣stle saith, 1. Cor. 11.27. Whosoeuer eateth this bread, and drinketh the cuppe of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guil∣ty of the body and bloud of the Lord, not as the Papists grossely imagine, because he eates and drinks the body and bloud of Christ really and corporally present, but because the abuse of the signe reacheth to the thing signi∣fied. Wee must therefore take heed, that we come not
to the Lords table vnreuerently, and vnprepared without a measure of true faith, and true repentance, for so doing wee make our selues guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord Iesus, the abuse of the signe euer redoundeth to the abuse of the thing signified by it And againe, let such as wilfully withdraw themselues from the outward Sacrament,Reproofe of such as wil∣fully absent themselues from the Lords table. know that they put away from them the things signified by the outward elements of it, euen the blessed body and precious bloud of Iesus Christ, and consequently they put away saluation from them, let all such as carelesly & wilfully absent themselues from the Lords table thinke vpon it. It followeth (hath he quickned together with him) In these words the Apostle declareth the raysing vp of the beleeuing Colossians together with Christ, in regard of the power of his resurrection to their quickning. I will briefly open the sense and meaning of the word (sayth he) (that is) God (quickned) this quickning is to bee vnderstoode not of a raysing vp of their dead bodies out of the graue, but of a viuification and quickning of them in this life,Interpreta∣tion. and that being twofolde, eyther a deliuerance from standing subiect to hell and eternall death, and a donation of right to eternall life, or a Freedome from spirituall death in sin, and working in them a spirituall life of holinesse, we are to vnderstand it of this second, as most fitly opposed to their death in sinne, that they were freede from death in sinne, and had a spirituall life of holinesse wrought in them, (to∣gether with him) that is, together with Christ, raysed from the dead, and that by vertue of his resurrection, they beleeuing in Christ and being one with him were partakers of the power of his resurrection to their quicke∣ning: thus then are wee to conceiue these words, as if the Apostle had said; you that were dead in sinne, hath God freede from your spirituall death in sinne, and wrought in you a spiritual life and holinesse by vertue of Christ his re∣surrection, you being true beleeuing members of Christ,
and one with him by faith; wee had these words in sub∣stance in the verse before; I will therefore onely obserue one thing from them (namely) this, hence it is cleere. That as many as truly beleeue in Christ are parta∣kers  of the power of his resurrection.As many as truly beleeue in Christ are partakers of the power & vertue of his resurrection. They being raised with Christ are pertakers not onely of the merit of his resurrection; but are also partakers of the vertue of it, they are quickned together with him, they are freed from the power and Dominion of sinne, and haue the spirituall life of grace and holinesse wrought in them. And this is that the Apostle laboured for, and accounted so excellent. Phil. 3.10. The Apostle Peter, 1. Pet. 1.3. saith plainely, We are regenerate vnto a liuely hope by the re∣surrection of Iesus Christ from the dead. The Scripture is full of proofe to this purpose, consider wee the reason  of it (namely) this, Christ our head being risen from the dead, now liues onely a spirituall life, before his death, hee liued a naturall life, yet without sinne, he did eate, drinke, sleepe, and vsed all actions of life; but in his resurrection, he put away that naturall life, and hee now liues onely a spirituall life, and therefore it is not possible that any of his members should still remaine in their spirituall death of sinne, it cannot be but they are partakers with Christ in his spirituall life, and by the power of the same spirit dwel∣ling in Christ, and in his members, are they quickned with a new life of grace and holinesse. Let no man then deceiue himselfe, let none of vs think  we truly beleeue in Christ, vnlesse we find in vs the power of his resurrection,None truely beleeue in Christ, but such as finde in themselues the power of his resurre∣ction. that wee are freed from the power of sinne, and haue a spirituall life wrought in vs. If wee liue in any knowne sinne and lie vnder the power of it, as in drunkennesse, adultery, malice, or the like, wee falsely perswade our selues, we beleeue in Christ, and know it for a truth, that as it is said, Reuel. 20.6. He that is partaker in the first resurrection, the second death shall neuer haue power one him: so on the contrary, such as are not par∣takers
of the first resurrection, such as are not raised vp frō their death in sinne, they shall certainely feele and endure the second death. And let this stirre vs vp not to rest till wee finde and feele the vertue of Christ his resurrection freeing vs from the death of sinne and quickning vs with a new life of grace and holinesse. Againe, is it so that as many as truly beleeue in Christ, are pertakers of the vertue of his resurrection, quickning them with a new life of holinesse, then may as many as find themselue freed from the death of sinne and quick∣ned by grace to a new life,Comfort for such as finde themselues freed from the power of sin, and quickned by grace to a new life. comfort themselues with assu∣rance that they are such as doe truely beleeue in Christ; yea, the comfort of this is yet greater, they may heereby assure themselues of the continuance of the Lords mercy towards them, that he will continue to be good & merciful to them for euer, for it was of his owne meere mercy that he quickned them being dead in their sinnes, the Apostle shewes it plainely, Ephes. 2.4.5. and he hauing vouchsafed his mercy to the quickning of them, that mercy of his shal neuer forsake them, but shall be reached forth vnto them for euer; it is the Apostles argument to prooue the con∣tinuance of Gods loue, Rom. 5 8 9.10. As many therefore as haue found the loue and mercy of God to raise them vp from the death of sinne, may assure themselues that the same loue and mercy shall euer be reached out vnto them, that is a singular comfort to all true beleeuers. Come wee to the last words of this verse. Forgiuing you all your trespasses. In some bookes we find, Forgiuing vs all our trespasses. The Apostle meaning himselfe, and other beleeuing Iewes, aswell as the Colossians, and other Gentiles. It is not materiall whether we reade (you) or (vs) it comes all to one purpose. That remission of sinnes is the ground of the spi∣rituall quickning both of Iewes and Gentiles dead in sinnes by nature.
The word translated (Forgiuing) doth properly signifie freely forgiuing,Interpreta∣tion. and in the originall it is put downe in the time past, and doth signifie hauing freely forgiuen (tre∣spasses) that word in the originall, is the same wee had in the beginning of this verse, and doth signifie both actuall and originall sinne, any aberation or declining from the Law of God; and so the Apostles meaning in these words is briefely this. Hauing freely forgiuen you all your sinnes, both originall and actuall. First, heere obserue wee the context that the Apostle makes the forgiuenesse of their sinnes the ground of their quickning, and so he speakes in the time past, hauing for∣giuen vs, as if he had said, You hath he quickned, when hee had forgiuen you your sinnes. Hence note we thus much, That forgiuenesse of sinnes is by order of nature be∣fore  spirituall quicknings by grace,Forgiuenesse of sinnes is by order of na∣ture before spirituall life of grace and holinesse inherent. though in time they goe together, when the Lord doth vouchsafe to forgiue any man his sinnes, at the same time he workes in him a measure of grace and holinesse, yet in naturall order re∣mission of sinnes goes before such spirituall life of grace and holinesse inherent: For as the Apostle hath plainly taught vs, Rom. 8.30. Iustification goes before glorifica∣tion, and vnder glorification hee comprehends sanctifi∣cation, now one part of Iustification is remission of sins;  therefore that in nature is before any measure of grace and holinesse wrought in vs. The Lord doth first discharge a man of the guiltinesse of his sinne, and wash away that in the bloud of Iesus Christ, and then free him from the dominion of sinne, and purge his conscience from deade workes to serue the li∣uing God, as the holy Ghost speaks, Heb. 9 14. For vse;  Is it so that remission of sinnes euer goes before spirituall life of grace and holinesse.
Surely then it is a good argument to say, I am freed from the power of my sinne. Therefore from the guilt and punishment of my sinne. A man may certainly conclude and gather from his sanctification, the remission of his sins;A man may certainely ga∣ther from his sanctification the remission of his sinnes. the deuill wil suffer any man to say his sins are forgiuē, & he hopes to be saued: but would any man prooue it, & so proue it as hee may settle his owne heart in assurance of it, and put the Deuill to silence, that he shall not be able to gainesay it, let him then prooue it from his owne quickning by grace, and that is an holy kinde of reasoning, and an argument that will neuer deceiue him; if any bee able to say truely, whereas I was dead in sinne, and to euery good worke re∣probate, the Lord hath put into me an heauenly life, and made me actiue and liuely to doe his will, both in my ge∣nerall and particular calling; yea, it is meat and drinke to me to doe his will, the same party may safely say, my sins are forgiuen. Let it be thought on by such, as in any mea∣sure finde themselues truely sanctified: the next thing that offers it selfe to be considered, is the word heere vsed (forgiuing) which signifies, as I haue shewed, freely forgi∣uing; whence we are taught thus much. That forgiueness of sinnes is free, it is of the meere free grace and mercy of God,Forgiuenesse of sinnes is of the meere free grace & mer∣cy of God. that sinnes are for∣giuen. Which point is plainely taught by the Apostle not on∣lie heere, but in diuers other places, Rom. 3.24. Hee saith in expresse termes we are iustified freely by his grace, not onely by the grace of God but freely; giuing vs to vnder∣stand, that our iustification, whereof one part is remissi∣on of sinnes, is of grace, and that of meere grace, and of nothing but grace, Ephes. 1.7. He saith wee haue forgiue∣nesse of sinnes, according to his rich grace, the Apostle is not content to say according to grace, but according to his rich grace, thereby signifying not onely necessary suf∣ficiency,
but euen superaboundant plenty of grace, and so excluding all other things as euery way needlesse; it were easie to adde to these other like places, but these may suf∣fice; yet before we come to the vse of this point a doubt must be remoued. Some may say, is forgiuenesse of sinnes free?  it seemes not so, for it is for the merit of Christ, he hath satisfied for sinnes, therefore the pardon of them is not free. Ans.  It is true indeede, in regard of Christ, forgiue∣nesse of sinnes is not free, hee hath paid the ransome for sinne, but in respect of vs it is euery way free; yea, there∣in appeares the greater grace and riches of Gods mercy towards vs, as the Apostle speakes, in that God gaue his Sonne to die for vs, and to satisfie for our sinnes: it re∣maines then a truth, that forgiuenesse of sinnes is to vs e∣uery way free, and of the meere grace and mercy of God. Come we to the vse of this: First, this meets with that  doctrine of the Papists, who teach that men by workes of pennance, as they call them, merit the remouall of the temporall punishment that it is due to sinne.Confutation of Popish hu∣mane satisfa∣ctions for the temporall pu∣nishement of sinne. Christ, say they, hath taken away the guilt of sinne and the eternall punishment of it; but men must satisfie for the temporall punishment, either heere or in purgatory. This cannot stand with the truth now deliuered, that forgiuenesse of sinnes is euery way free, how can that bee euery way free which we in some part merit and satissie for? it cannot be freely giuen and deserued, now it is the plaine text of the Apostle, that wee are iustified freely. Yea, but saith the Papist,  the word (freely) doth not exclude all our working and suffering in that matter of iu∣stification; for by your owne doctrine it is necessarie that we beleeue and bring foorth new fruits? To this they are easily answered, it is true,  the word (freely) doth not exclude faith and the fruits of it, but it shuts out all merit of faith, and of repentance, and other
good fruits, and doth plainely shew, that there is nothing in vs, no not faith it selfe, that doth merit remission of our sinnes, it is of grace, and of meere free grace, they cannot possibly by any shift, auoid the euidence of that place, I leaue them and come to our selues, and for the vse of the point to our selues. Is it so that forgiuenesse of sinnes is free and of the meere grace and mercy of God, then let not any vnworthinesse of ours, discourage and hinder vs from apprehending the mercy of God for the pardon of our sinnes,Our owne vnworthynes must not dis∣couage nor hinder vs frō apprehending Gods mercy for the pardō of our sinnes. remember we that pardon of sinne is freely giuen, it is not any way de∣serued by vs, therefore doubt not of it in regard of thine owne vnworthinesse, indeed if remission of sinnes did de∣pend vpon any worthynesse in vs, we had then great cause to doubt of it. But it depends only on the meere free grace and mercy of God. Let not therfore our vnworthenes dis∣courage vs, it is a sweet saying, 1. Ioh. 1.9. often to be remē∣bred of vs, If we acknowledge our sins; God is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sins. If God can bee vnfaithfull (not if we be vnworthy) but, I say, if God can be vnfaithful, which is not possible, thē may we doubt of the pardon of our sins humbly acknowledged: yea, marke what comfort we may raise from that place, if we see our vnworthinesse, and with broken harts acknowledge it, God is faithful & iust to for∣giue it, be it neuer so great. I speak not this, to hearten any one in a course of sin, that any should heape sin vpon sin; because no vnworthynesse of ours may discourage vs: no, no, that is to sauour this doctrin to death & not to life, and to turne the grace of God into presumption; but I speake it for the comfort of such as through weaknesse, either are, or hereafter may be afraid, & stand in doubt of the pardon of their sinnes, in regard of their great vnworthinesse, they see themselues so vnworthy wretches, that they doubt whether mercy beong to them for the pardon of their sinnes, or no. Let such know for their comfort, that the Lords mercy depends not on their worthynes, it is freely
giuen where it pleaseth the Lord to bestow it; for the par∣don of sinnes, yea let them know further for their com∣fort, that they seeing and bewailing their vnworthynes and desiring pardon of their sinnes, they want no merit. How so will some say? I answere▪  they haue the mercy of God, and the infinite merit of Christ belonging vnto them for the pardon of their sinnes, and therefore they haue no cause to bee dis∣couraged, in regard of their owne vnworthinesse, so long as the Lord abounds in mercy, so long doe they abound in merit, and that is a sweete comfort to be thought on, and especially then let vs thinke on it when our owne vnwor∣thinesse doth stand vp betweene vs and the mercie of God for the pardon of our sinnes. One thing more is to bee obserued from these words  (namely) this the Apostle saith (forgiuing you all your trespasses) hence it is cleere, that such as truely beleeue in Christ, haue entire and full remission of all their sinnes,Such as truly beleeue in Christ haue full remission of all their sinnes. not any one of their sinnes shall bee laid to their charge: they are free from the guilt and punishment of them all. This doth the Apostle plainely teach. Rom. 8.1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit: and Dauid saith. Psal. 10.3.3. Praise the Lord my soule and forget not all his benefits, which forgiueth all thine iniquities and heale al thine infirmities. The vse of it serues to comfort vs exceedingly, as many  of vs as truely beleeue in Christ our sinnes can hurt vs no more then if they had neuer beene done,Comfort to all true belee∣uers that none of their sinnes can hurt them no not the most hainous amongst them, not those wherein we haue conti∣nued long, and haue doubled and repeated often, not those we haue done with much boldnesse and presumpti∣on, we now beleeuing in Christ haue free forgiuenesse of them all, not one of them excepted, which is an exceeding great comfort, let vs further follow it in our owne priuate meditations.
Againe, is it so that we beleeuing in Christ haue for∣giuenesse of all our sinnes,Wee must so forgiue our brethren of∣fending vs, as God forgiueth vs sinning a∣gainst him. we must then learne so to for∣giue our brethren, it is the Apostles rule: Ephes. 4.32. For∣giue one another, euen as God for Christ sake forgiueth you: away then with all maimed and halfe forgiuenesse of our brethren, forgiuing one offence, and retaining an other vnforgiuen; and let vs take heed in this case of the reasoning of the flesh: as forsoth, the matter is so grieuous, so preiudiciall, we could be content to be entreated to for∣giue many other offences, but this wee cannot, with many other the like shifts. Let vs remember that God forgiues vs all our sinnes be they neuer so great, why then should not we forgiue our brethren, if we say wee deserue better of them, so doth God of vs; if wee meant him or her no harme, no more doth God vs; if we say, the party is farre our inferiour, Why? what are we to the Lord, if we ma∣ny times haue forgiuen them, with warning to doe no more so, hath not God much oftner forgiuen vs? Yea, times without number; learne wee then to bee mercifull, as our heauenly father is merciful, & know that blessed are the mercifull,Iam. 2.13. for they shall find mercy, and there shall be iudgement mercilesse to him that shewes no mercy. VER. 14. And putting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against vs, which was contrary to vs, he euen tooke it out of the way, and fastned it vpon the Crosse. In this verse, as it hath respect to the generall drift of this Chapter. That all things out of Christ in the matter of sal∣uation are nothing woorth. The Apostle deales against the Legall ceremonies of of the Iewes and prooues them to bee superfluous; yea, pernicious in that case: his argument is this. The hand¦writing of ordinances or the Legall ceremonies that was
in time of the law, Christ hath put out and taken away by his death. Therefore to reuoke it, and to seeke to bring it in force againe, which false teachers labour to doe in vrging circumcision and the ceremonies of the Law were not onelie vaine but pernicious and hurtfull. That is the generall purpose of the Apostle in this verse. More particularly it conteins an amplification of the benefite spoken of in the last wordes of the verse forego∣ing (namely) the full remission of all our sinnes, vnder∣standing those words both of the Iewes and Gentiles be∣lieuing, and the Apostle doth amplifie that benefite in this verse by the meanes whereby wee attaine it, that wee are fully discharged from the guilt and punishment of all our sinnes, by full satisfaction made for them by Christ. Now that full satisfaction is not in plaine terms pro∣pounded, but is laide downe in the proofe of it, and was proued by an argument taken from the disanulling or cancelling of a bill or bond which did witnesse our guil∣tinesse of sinne, and by which wee stood bound ouer to the punishment of sinne, that Christ hath cancelled that bond, and therefore fully satisfied for our sinnes, that is the summe and substance of this verse. In the verse wee haue these particular things laid be∣fore vs. First, a description of that bill or bond which did te∣stifie  our guiltinesse of sinne, and that by the nature of it, before the cancelling, that it was an hand writing, or an obligation or bond of ordinances. Secondly, the cancelling of that bond by Christ which is set downe by certaine degrees ascending or going vp∣ward  one aboue another, as that hee put it out, that hee tooke it out of the way, and that hee fastened it on the
Crosse, in which wordes is implied the meanes by which Christ cancelled the bond (namely) his crosse or death on the crosse. Thirdly, how farre forth he hath cancelled it (name∣ly) so farre as it was against vs, and contrary to vs. Come wee to the words as they are laide downe in or∣der, and first of these words. And putting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against vs, which was contrary to vs. Interpreta∣tion.And putting out, or hauing put out the originall word signifies hauing blotted out, and that perfectly, so as not one letter or title remaines vnblotted out (hand-writing of ordinances) by these words wee are properly to vn∣derstand the law of ceremonies belonging to the Iewes in time of the olde Testament; touching circumcision and diuers washings, and other ceremonies, which the Apo∣stle cals the law of commandements which standeth inor∣dinances, Ephes. 2.15. but with all (as I take it.) Wee are further to vnderstand by this hand-writing of ordinances, euen the whole morall law of God; because the Apostle in this verse (no doubt) would make knowne the bene∣fite of Christ his death both to Iewes and Gentiles, that it brought to all that beleeue in him, not onely remission of sinnes, but a freedome from the law, both ceremoniall & morall (which was against vs, which was contrary to vs) (that is) so farre foorth as it did conuince, accuse; and con∣demne vs for sinne, and bound vs ouer as a bond to the punishment of sinne.  Now if any demaund how the le∣gall ceremonies of the Iewes, were thus an hand-writing of ordinances against them. I answere,  they were so in re∣gard of the vse of them. The Iewes in vsing of them did as it were subscribe to their owne guiltinesse of death and damnation: in vsing circumcision, they made knowne they had originall sinne, and were guilty of it, their mani∣fold
washings did shew they were exceedingly filthy in the sight of God, and so guilty of the curse of the law, and so did their sacrifices. Thus then conceiue wee these words, as if the Apostle had said, And hauing perfectly blotted out the law of cere∣monies, which in the vse of it did conuince the Iewes of sinne, and binde them ouer to death for sinne, and the whole morall Law so far forth as it did ac∣cuse, conuince and condemne vs of sinne. Now from hence it i is clare that Christ hath not onely  paide the debt of Gods chosen, and satisfied for their sins, but he hath also cancelled the bond which did witnesse their guiltinesse of sinne,Christ hath both paid the debt of Gods chosen, and also cancelled the bond, wit∣nessing their guiltinesse. Reason. accuse them for sinne, and bind them ouer to the punishment of sinne. The reason and ground of this is very plaine (namely) this, Christ hath not onely paide euery iot of the principal debt of Gods chosen, but hath also fully answered the for∣feiture and penalty that did lye against them, for the breach of that bond of the law of God (namely) the curse of the law, for as the Apostle saith, Gal. 3.13. Hee was made euen a curse for them, therefore now the law in re∣gard of accusation, and the curse of it, is frustrate, and of no force, strength, nor vertue against them, it is cancel∣led, it is as if it had neuer beene, wee may then safely con∣clude with the Apostle against our aduersaries the Pa∣pists. That Christ hath fully satisfied for the sinnes  of Gods chosen.Gods chosen need not peece out Christ his sa∣tisfaction for their sins by anything they can do or suf∣fer as the Pa¦pists teach. We know it in common experience, that we vse not to deliuer vp or cancell their bond, till the whole debt bee payde, and they bee fully satisfied, if but halfe the debt or three quarters of it be paid, and not all in such sort, as the bonde requireth, men still retaine the bond in full strength and vertue, but if the bond bee deliuered vp or cancelled, that argues full contentment, and full satisfac∣tion,
so is it betweene God and his chosen. Christ their suerty who vndertooke the payment of their debt to God his Father, hath paid the debt, and cancelled the bond, & therefore hath fully satisfied for them; it is most absurde and grosse to thinke, there is any thing vnsatisfied, and a∣ny thing left for them to pay, the bond of their debt be∣ing cancelled, especially the bond being in the hands of God, who knowes whether any part of the debt bee lefte vnpaide; and is able to keepe the bond in his hands, if it bee not fully satisfied, indeed if the bond had beene in mens hands, it might happily haue beene gotten from them by violence or fraud, but the bond being in the hands of God, no such thing can bee feared or suspected, therefore he deliuering the bond into Christ his hands, & suffering him to cancell it, it is a plaine and inuincible eui∣dence that hee is fully satisfied for the sinnes of his cho∣sen, and they neede not patch or peece out that satisfacti∣on made by Christ, by any thing they can doe or suffer, as the Papists doe grossely imagine. Such as be in Christ are so discharged from their sinnes as that none can lay any thing to their charge.Againe, this doctrine may serue exceeding much for the comfort of such as are in Christ; for why is it so that Christ hath not onely satisfied for their sinnes, but can∣celled the bond which did witnesse their guiltinesse, cer∣tainly then they may safely say with the Apostle, Rom. 8 33. who shall lay any thing to our charge, who shall con∣demne vs, they are cleare and free in law, the law cannot charge them with any thing, yea the Diuell the accuser of the brethren; Reuel. 12.10. is cast down and put to silence and can lay nothing iustly against them▪ yea, (which is the greatest comfort of all) God himselfe can bring no action against them, their surety Christ Iesus hath paide their debt and forfeyture, and cancelled the bond, wherin they stood bound to God, they are acquitted before the iudge∣ment seat of God, euen in the high Court of Heauen; therefore it is not possible they should any where be con∣demned, vnlesse wee say there is some greater then God;
or an higher Court of Iustice then the iudgement seat of God, which were folly and blasphemy once to thinke; how then, shall not this affect the hearts of Gods chosen, and fill them with comfort and ioy vnspeakeable, men commonly doe applaud and please themselues, and find great contentment in this, when they can truely say they owe no man a groat, and they are out of debt, how much more may such as are in Christ finde sweetnesse and com∣fort in this, that they are out of Gods debt, not in regard of duety, thankefulnesse and obedience, but in regard of his curse and iudgements, they now are no more bound ouer, and lyable to the curse of the law, let as many as tru∣ly belong to Christ, meditate and thinke on it for their comfort. That I will handle in the next place shall be that which is offered from the word (hand-writing) In that the Law is called an hand-writing, an obligation or bond, and that against vs we are taught thus much. That the morall law is not onely a bond of obedi∣ence,  hut also a bond of conuiction, a bond conuincing accusing and condemning for sinne, and binding to the curse for the breach and transgression of it, vnlesse there be a freedome from it by ChristThe morall Law not only bindes to the obedience of it, but to the curse also for the transgres∣sion of it, vn∣lesse there be a freedome from it by Christ. as it is in penall statutes in the common wealth, men are not onely bound to the o∣bedience of them, but to the penalty for the breach of thē, so is it with vs in respect of the law of God, we are not on∣ly bound to obey it but to the penalty of it: if we disobey it and breake it, it is the condition annexed to the law, plainely propounded in the word of God: doe this and liue, doe it not, and die the death, breake it and thou art cursed, thou art bound to the curse, which is the penaltie of the law: for cursed is euery one that continueth not in all things that are written in the booke of the law to do them, it is a cleare point and stands with the tenor of the iustice of God, that the breach of the law should bind men ouer to his curse, vnlesse there bee deliuerance from it by Christ.
See then the miserable condition of such as are out of Christ,The misera∣ble condition of such as bee out of Christ. as all are who liue in their sinnes, and will not be reformed, they are bound by the law to the curse of God, (that is) to perpetuall woe end misery both in the time of this life, in the end of this life, and after it is ended, euen to Gods bitter wrath in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone for euer. Oh that men who liue in their sins, would thinke on this as they ought, if they see not them∣selue thus miserable in regard of the curse, euen therein is the curse already vpon them in blindnesse of minde, & hardnesse of heart, if they see and know their sins as they cannot but see and know them, who haue beene often conuinced of them, as their drunkennesse, swearing, ma∣litious dealing, couetousnesse, vsury, seeking to Wizards, Sabbath breaking, and the like; if men see these sinnes, and their owne consciences tell them, they deserue the eternall wrath of God for them, let them then consider thus much and remember it that they are bound ouer to the curse of the law by a double, yea by a threefold bond, they are bound By the bond of the Law. By the bond of the Gospell, and By the bond of their owne conscience to death and damnation, And that this may bee thought on with profite. Let vs consider what a trouble the remembrance of sinne hath beene to the godly at some times.The remem∣brance of sin hath been ve∣ry trouble∣some to the godly at some times. Iob said, God writ bit∣ter things against him; and made him to possesse the ini∣quities of his youth, Psal 38 3. Dauid said hee had no rest in his bones because of his sinne, and verse 8. that he roa∣red for the very griefe of his heart; if the memory of sinne be such a trouble to the godly, oh what a racke will it bee one day to him that hath it in full force against him, hee that besides the bond of the law, the bond of the Gospell, hath the bond of his owne conscience binding him ouer to death and damnation, surely when the Lord shall let
loose the corde of his conscience who is out of Christ, though it bee in the middest of his iolity, he shall find it will bee as the hand-writing that Belshatzar saw, Dan. 5.6. it wil change the coppy of his countenance, lose his ioints and his knees will smite one against the other, yea he shall feele the flames of hell fire flashing vpon his soule & con∣science, thinke on this all you that now please your selues in a course of sinne. Come we to a second vse, is it so that the law is a bond  binding ouer to the curse for the breach of it, vnlesse there be freedome from it by Christ, then let the law bee as the Apostle cals it. Gal. 3.24. our scholemaster to bring vs to Christ;The Lawe ought to bee our Schoole∣master to bring vs to Christ. let the whipping and terrors of the law driue vs from it selfe to the throne of grace and mercy, and for en∣couragement, know we that the end of conuiction by the law is, that the promise of mercy may bee giuen to them that beleeue as the Apostle hath taught vs, Gal. 3.22. the law concludes all vnder sinne, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be giuen to them that beleeue, Know then that the terrors of the law threatning the curse and perdition, must be a preparatiue to saluation▪ it must driue vs from the law to Christ; that hee may be our Sa∣uiour: When therefore the Law doth conuince and ac∣cuse thee of sinne, arraigne thee at the barre of Gods iudgement, and fill thy soule with terrour, appeale from it, and goe to Christ, and beleeue in him, and that with such a faith as is ioined with hope, loue, and new obedi∣ence, and the promise of pardon and life euerlasting shall certainly be giuen to thee. The next thing that by order of the words wee are led to consider, is the word (Ordinances) and therein to shew the abrogation of the Law of Ceremonies, but wee shall more fitly handle that, Vers. 17. The next thing, I will handle, shall be that, which the words following doe of∣fer to our consideration (That was against vs, or which was contrary to vs) I take those words together, because the lat∣ter
are but an expressing of the former in other termes, and all one in effect, the meaning I shewed to bee this, so farre foorth as the Law did conuince of sinne, and as a bond binds ouer to the punishment of sinne. Hence then it is cleare. That Christ hath remoued and taken away the morall Law of God, from the chosen of God,Christ hath taken away the rigour and cursse of the morall Law from Gods chosen. and freed them frō it, not in regard of obedience, or as a rule of obedience and the duties of loue both to God and men, but in re∣gard of the rigour and curse of it, as it is a rule of good life. it is perpetuall, it continues for euer, and admits no abro∣gation. Our Sauiour Christ saith, Matth. 5.17. He came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it. And the Apostle, Rom. 3.31. Doe we make the Law of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea, wee establish the Law; the Law then as it is a rule of good duties, both to God and men, is vnchangeable, not abrogated by Christ, but in the ri∣gour of it, requiring of vs in this life exact and perfect o∣bedience, and that personall, that a man in his owne per∣son fulfill it, and for matter and manner doe perfectly all things contained in it, and in the threatning, inexorable seuerity and curse of it, as it doth either conuince of sinne for the least breach of it, or as it binderh to the curse, for the transgression of it; so it is against vs, and contrary to vs, and so it is taken away and remoued by Christ. The Apostle saith, Rom 6.14. Yee are vnder the Law, as many as belong to Christ are not vnder the Law, (that is) vnder the rigour of the Law; God doth not examine their obe∣dience according to the strict rule of the Law, but is plea∣sed through his grace in Christ, to accept their sincere, though imperfect obedience, Gal. 3.13. It is most plaine, that Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the Lawe, when he was made a curse for vs, (for it is written) Cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree, and Gal. 4.4.5. That hee became subiect to the Law that hee might redeeme them which were veder the Law, that is, them that were
vnder the yoake and bondage of the Law, and especially vnder the curse of it, that hee might redeeme them from vnder the bondage and curse of the Lawe: it is then a cleare point. That Christ hath freed Gods chosen from the ri∣gour and curse of the morall Law of God. Come we to the vse of it: and first, this doctrine may  discouer vnto vs the vaine shift, and pernicious illusion of many in the world, who to iustifie and maintaine their loosenesse of life,Discouery of the vaine shift vsed by many to maintaine their loosenes of life. and carelesse contempt of the will of God, and to exempt themselues from all holy obedience, sticke not to charge the Lawes and Commandements of God with too much rigour, and too much strictnesse; yea they dare say, in plaine termes, the Preachers of the word in vrging good duties vpon them, lay too much vppon them, and doe too much restraine them of their pleasures and profits, of liberty in speaches, and freedome in appa∣rell, and such like; to giue instance in some particulars, will not the drunkard and sensuall person say, he must fol∣low his pleasures, and take his delight among his compa∣nions, abridge him of that, and take away his life. Will not the proud person, man or woman, say, they must needes follow the fashion, they must bee like others, or else bee counted no body in the world: and what is the plea of couetous persons that will be rich, howsoeuer they get it, forsooth, we must vse what meanes we can for our state, & make the most of our own: and what say swearers, & blas∣phemers, Oh we cannot alwaies auoid an oath, it is but a smal matter now and then to rap out an oath, & to sweare a little: and generally what say al loose liuers, & prophane persons, but this; the Preachers would haue vs become saints on earth, but it will not be, our nature cannot like of such strictnesse. Now, what is this (I beseech you) but, as if they should say the law of God, the rule of holy and good life is too rigorous, and too intollerable, and wee cannot endure it: yea, what is this but a plaine euidence that they
belong not to Christ, for there is no rigour in the Law to them that are in Christ. If then we hold the law too rigo∣rous and strict, wee make an argument against our selues, wee conclude, our selues not to belong to Christ, and of our owne mouthes will the Lord one day iudge vs; thinke on it all you whosoeuer you be that are euer carping and cauelling and excepting against some thing in each Com∣mandement of GOD as too hard, too strict, and too rigorous. And now to speake something on the other side, for the comfort and encouragement of such as are in Christ, and endeauour to obey the will of God in all things, without any reasoning and without disputing against it. Let them know for their comfort, that though they performe not good duties perfectly, yet their practise of them faithfully is pleasing to God,Comfort to such as are in Christ, their faithfull pra∣ctise of good duties though it bee vnper∣fect, yet it is pleasing to God. though they cast not off all e∣uill fully, as they desire; yet true resistance of it with hatred, is accepted of the Lord, though they haue so many infir∣mities as doe make them often to sinne, and to come short of perfection in their best actions; yet the Lord will not examine their actions according to the strict rule of his Law. They are freed by Christ from the rigour of the law and their imperfect obedience to the Law is dead in the bloud of Christ, and so made, not (as the Papists teach) meritorious, but pleasing to God, their failings besides their purpose shall neuer be laid to their charge, the Lord will accept their will and sincere affection to obey him in all things, as obedience acceptable to him, for that is the worke of God in them, hee works that affection in them, and know it for a certaine truth, God will approue thee for his own worke found in thee, and not reiect thee for thine, hee hath wrought in thee a will to obey him, hee will not cast thee off because of thy weaknesse, but will accept thy will to obey, for obedience it selfe, and will spare thee in regard of thy weakenesse, as a man spareth his own childe, they are the Lords owne words vttered by the mouth of
his Prophet, Mal. 3.17. a man seeing the willingnesse of his childe to doe that hee bids him though not able to do it, is content to accept it as the deed it selfe: so doth God deale with his children, which may be an excellent com∣fort and encouragement to all that are in Christ, to goe on in walking humbly before the Lord and endeauoring to keepe faith and a good conscience. Againe, is it so that Christ hath freed Gods chosen  from the curse of the Law, then let as many as truely be∣leeue in Christ, learne not to feare any euill ouermuch,Such as truely beleeue in Christ, must learne not to feare any euill ouermuch. as reuiling, cursings of ill tongs witchcraft, plague, pestilence famine, sword, or death it selfe, for why, the curse which makes all these and other like things hurtfull is remoued from them, that are in Christ. Therefore let not them feare these things before they come, nor bee discouraged when they fall vpon them. We read Heb. 11.36.37.38. That such as were renouned for their faith in Christ and through faith obtained a good report, were tried by mockings and scourgings; yea, moreouer by bonds and imprisonment, they were stoned, they were heawen asun∣der, and had their bones broken, &c. Let vs then bee strengthned by this cloud of witnesses, as the holy Ghost calles it. Heb. 12. First, Against feare of any euill that may befall vs al∣though it be so, that wee bee taken away through want of food in time of dearth, or by plague or pestilence, or by any other meanes; yet remember this, if we be in Christ, the venome and sting of these things is remooued from vs and they fall not vpon vs, as a curse, indeed if wee bee out of Christ, these things are but praeludia, forerunners of further woe and misery, such as liue in their sinnes, and are out of Christ their condition is fearefull:Note. let them know to their terror, that, as they that are in Christ haue no law written against them, the handwriting that was a∣gainst them is blotted out and cancelled, so they that bee out of Christ, haue the Law in full force and strength a∣gainst
them, they are subiect to the rigour of the Law; yea which is more; they haue no Gospell written for them, for the comforts and sweete promises of the Gospell belong to none, but to them that are in Christ; the Gos∣pell in it selfe which is the sweet couenant of grace, to them that are out of Christ, is a word of bitternesse, a word of terror, and further increase of iudgement, because they beleeue it not, and the seales of that couenant, the Sacra∣ments receiued by them, become seales of their iudge∣ment and damnation, 1 Cor. 11.29. In beeing pertakers of them, they eate and drinke iudgement and the curse of God to themselues, and there is but a step betweene them and hel, & there is no other difference between them and those that now lie frying in Hel fire; but this, that they are past recouery, and these, in the great patience and long suffering of God, are suffered yet for a time, (how long or how short none knowes but the Lord) to see if they will accept of life and saluation offered them, which is a thing to be thought on with trembling; yea, such a thing as may moue the most wicked and prophane person, man or wo∣man in the world if the Deuill haue not taken full posses∣ssion of their soules, to bethinke themselues of speedy re∣formation. Come we to the degrees by which the Apostle setteth downe the cancelling of the hand writing that was a∣gainst vs. 1 He saith, Christ hath put it out. 2 He addes further, he hath euen taken it out of the way. And not content with that hee goeth a steppe higher, 3 And saith, he fastned it vpon the Crosse. Wee are in generall to marke the amplification of this point, the Apostle thought it not sufficient to say, wee haue grace and full remission of all our sinnes, but sub∣ioines to that. That the Bill or Bond which did conuince vs of
sinne, and bind vs ouer to the punishment, is blot∣ted out. Yea, but might some say, though it be blotted out,  yet some controuersie may arise betweene▪ the creditor and the debtor about it. The Apostle preuents this, and saith,  Christ hath euen taken away the matter of difference. Yea, but might some say,  what if it bee but kept hid in some place for a time. This also the Apostle meets withall, and saith,  we need not doubt any such matter for Christ hath fastned it to the Crosse, and torne it in peeces with the nailes of his crosse; hence wee may easily gather this generall conclu: sion. That the word of God is able to resolue vs all dif∣ficulties, and to answer all occurring doubts, of the flesh whatsoeuer. But I will hold to the particular heere intended by the Apostle: hence it followeth necessarily. If we truely beleeue in Christ wee are to be fully resol∣ued  of the pardon of all our sinnes,True belee∣uers are to be fully resolued of the pardon of all their sinnes. and not to doubt of it, wee must bee fully perswaded of the truth of the whole word of God, but especially of those things be they threat∣nings or promises which the spirit of God hath much bea∣ten vpon, and vrged with much amplyfication. Hath the holy Ghost been carefull to take away all scru∣ple and to answer all doubts against full satisfaction for the sinnes of Gods chosen, and assurance of the pardon of them to them that are in Christ,  and shall we beleeuing in Christ make doubt of it? Surely it must needs be a satanicall Spirit that shall con∣tradict the Spirit of God, in so plaine and plentifull eui∣dence of truth; and indeed it is the spirit of Antichrist that doth gaine say it. The Papists teach, we can haue no assurance by faith, that our sinnes are forgiuen vs,It is the spirit of Antichrist that teacheth that true be∣leeuers can∣not be assured by faith of the pardon of their sinnes. and one of their cauelling obiections is this.
Wee are to pray for the pardon of our sinnes euery day, and to say, forgiue vs our trespasses; therefore wee cannot be assured of the pardon of them, if we could, then we neede not pray for it. It is a needlesse thing (say they) to pray for that we are already sure of, as to pray that God would make Christ his sonne, to be incarnate, or the like. I answer, indeed if we had such assurance of the pardon of sinne, as were void of all doubting, it were needlesse to pray for it, but our assurance in this life is mingled with some doubting, with the greatest measure of assurance, there is some doubting through our corruption. There∣fore it is not needlesse, notwithstanding our assurance, to pray daily for the pardon of our sinnes, they may stand together, and it remaines a truth that wee may haue assu∣rance by faith of the pardon of our sinnes; yea, the Lord would haue his children so sure of the pardon of their sins whereof he giues them a dislike and true abhorring, as he would haue it an article of their faith and hath giuen his sacraments to seale vp to them that assurance. One thing more obserue wee, from these degrees by which the Apostle sets downe the cancelling of that hand writing that was against vs, wee are to marke that the A∣postle ioines these three things together. 1 Blotting out that hand working. 2 Taking it out of the way, and 3 Fastning it to the crosse. As indeed signifying one and the same thing in substance (namely) this That Christ hath remoued from the chosen of God the rigour and curse of the Law: so as now it hath no power ouer them and shall neuer hurt them. And this is amplified by the Apostle in regard of our weakenesse with this variety of phrase, that Christ hath blotted out the hand writing, taken it away, fastned it to
the crosse, ascending thus by degrees, but meaning one and the same thing, this is to be obserued to this purpose, it may teach vs: That the phrases and formes of speach vsed in Scrip∣ture  of blotting out sinnes, taking them away like a cloud or mist drawing them in the bottome of the sea, not im∣puting them, hiding and couering them, and the like, all of them come to this meaning, that sinne is quite taken away, and shall neuer hurt them that haue it blotted out, couered, or not imputed vnto them.The phrases and formes of speech vsed in Scripture, of blotting out sinnes, of taking them away like a cloud, and the like, signifie thus much, that sinne is quite taken a∣way and shall neuer hurt them that bee in Christ. It is all one with this, that their sinnes are fastned and nailed to the Crosse, for wee see the Apostle ioines these together, blotting out, taking away, and fastning to the Crosse, as all comming to one purpose; wickedly, and therefore most iniuriously deale the Papists with vs, in charging vs to make a iustified man, but as a whited tombe faire without and foule within, and why so? For∣sooth, because wee teach according to the phrase of the Scripture,  that a man iustified hath his sinnes couered and not imputed vnto him,Remouall of a wicked slander which the Papists cast vpon vs. but the merit of Christ his death imputed for the pardon of them. This, saith the Papist is to make a iustified man like to a sepulchre whited without with an imputed iustice, but within full of iniquity and dis∣order; a meere shift and cauelling slander, for to haue some hid and couered (as we see) according to the phrase of Scripture, is not (as they grossely imagine) to haue it cloaked, or as it were varnished ouer with a faire colour, it still remaining vnder that colour, no, no, it is to haue it quite remoued, and taken away in the punishment of it; for indeed nothing can be hid from Gods sight: when therefore sinne is said to be hid or couered in respect of God, the meaning must needes be, it is quite taken away, it is as if it had neuer beene, and let not the Papists by any cauill they can deuise, driue vs from this truth and from the comfort of it which is this. If the Lord impute not sinne, we are to know,Note. he will
neuer punish it, if he remember it not, certainely he will neuer reuenge it: if he couer our sins, without question he will neuer call them to iudgement, they are taken out of the way and fastned to the Crosse, and shall neuer bee laid to our charge. Come wee now to the very last words of this Verse, wherein (as I said) is implied the meanes by which Christ cancelled the handwriting that was against vs (namely) his Crosse,Interpreta∣tion. by the Crosse we are to vnderstand Christ his suffering death vpon the Crosse; that Christ by dying on the Crosse, did by that his death, blot out, take away and cancell the handwriting that was against vs, the very same nailes that were driuen into his hands and his feete, were by him driuen thorow that hand-writing: the meaning is in a word, that the very death, that Christ died on the Crosse, was an vtter abolishing and taking away of the hand-writing that was against the chosen of God. We are heere first to marke, that the Apostle doth a∣scribe the remouall, and the taking away of the hand-wri∣ting that was against vs, not to the life of Christ, but to his death; not to his actiue obedience, but to his passiue, to his suffering death on the Crosse. Hence we may conclude and easily gather. That Christ his actiue obedience, the obedience of his life, did not purchase and procure the taking away of the sinnes of Gods chosen, and of the curse due to them for their sinnes; but his passiue obedience,Christ his ac∣tiue obediēce did not pur∣chase the ta∣king away of the guilt and punishment due to Gods chosen for their sinnes, but his passiue obedience. his death and suffe∣ring; though Christ his actiue obedience was most exact and perfect, and he in his life fulfilled the whole Law of God perfectly, yet was not that perfect, legall and meri∣torious obedience of his, sufficient to procure remission of sinnes, freedome from the curse of the Law; hee must ouer and besides that, suffer death, euen the cursed death of the Crosse, and beare in his body and soule the extre∣mity of Gods wrath, before he could satisfie Gods iustice for the sinnes of his chosen: and therefore it is said Isai.
53.5. That he was wounded for our transgressions, and broken for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we are healed. And the Apostle, 1. Pet. 2.24. saith, He bare our sinnes in his body on the tree. I may safely say it and deliuer it as a certaine truth,  wee shall not finde in any place of the Scripture that remission of sinnes and remoual of the curse is ascribed to the actiue obedience of Christ, but is euer attributed to his death and to his passion. See then the intollerable pride of the papists, who dare challenge remission of sinnes, for some thing done by themselues;Discouerie of the monstrous pride of the Papists chal∣lenging re∣mission of sins for some∣thing done by themselues. yea, for some things done by themselues, which they haue no warrant in the word of God, but meerely deuised by themselues, as their pilgri∣mages, wilfull pouerty, vow of single life, and the like, they dare challenge pardon of sinnes for these things, and stand vpon it, that they purchase and procure remission of sinnes by them. Oh the height of pride in these men, Iesus Christ the righteous did not purchase remission of sinnes by his perfect fufilling of the Law in his life, and yet the proud Papist shall challenge it for his will worship, and de∣uised obedience, which indeed is most hatefull, and a most abominable pride and presumption. The next thing that is offered to our consideration, from this word (Crosse) is, that which the Apostle there∣by entends (namely) this. That Christ his death, his suffering and shedding  of his bloud on the crosse, is the onely meanes and meritorious cause of remouing the rigor and curse of the Law from Gods chosen,Onely by the death of Christ vpon the crosse was the rigour & cursse of the Law remo∣ued from Gods chosen. onely by the death of Christ on the crosse is the handwriting blotted out and quite remoued, and taken away from the chosen of God, for why? Christ on the Crosse stood in steed of Gods chosen, he was their surety. Heb. 7.22. And when he stood on the Crosse then onely he vnder-went the curse for them; the
Apostle shewes it most plainely, Gal. 3.13. he saith Christ redeemed them from the curse, but when? Euen then, saith the Apostle, when he was made a curse for them, and when was that? Surely then, when he hung on the crosse for so it followeth in the proofe of the Apostle, in the words following; for it is written, Cursed is euery one that hangeth on tree. He redeemed them from the curse, euen then, when he was made a curse for them, and that was when he hung on the Crosse, which is a most plaine and pregnant proofe of this point, that onely by the death of Christ on the Crosse, the rigour and curse of the Law was remoued from Gods chosen. How then was it remoued from them that liued before the death of Christ? I answer,  euen by the death of Christ to come, his death was as effectuall to take away the curse from al Gods cho∣sen before the death of Christ, as it was when he hung on  the Crosse, for hee was the Lambe slaine from the begin∣ning of the world.We must goe to the crosse of Iesus Christ if we will find deliuerance from the curse and from the venome and sting of any trouble or calamity. Reuel. 13.8. First then, hence we learne, whither wee are to goe to bee freed from the curse, whither to goe to finde deliue∣rance from the venome & sting of any trouble or calami∣tie that shall befal vs (namely) to the Crosse of Iesus Christ, when thou art sicke or cast, into any trouble whatsoeuer, if thou desire to haue the bitternes and curse of that trou∣ble remooued, then seeke thou to the Crosse of Iesus Christ. How is that to be done may some say? I answer,  the first thing thou doest in time of thy distresse, let it be this, euen an earnest suite put vp to God for the pardon of thy sinnes, in the bloud of Iesus Christ; seeke to the Crosse of Christ for remission of thy sinnes, and especially for that sinne thou thinkest is the cause of thy trouble; and neuer rest seeking and suing to the Lord till it please him to giue thee some assurance of the pardon of thy sinnes, and then thou shalt bee sure, though thy
trouble bee still continued on thee, yet the venome and bitternesse of that trouble is remooued from thee, and it shall not hurt thee, and without this thou shalt finde no comfort in the time of thy trouble, and though thou beest deliuered from it, yet will it bee but in iudgement, not in mercy, as it was with Pharaoh, so shall it bee with thee: one trouble shall follow in the necke of an other, till thou be destroied. Learne then in time of thy distresse to goe to the Crosse of Iesus Christ for ease and comfort, and then thou shalt be sure, whether it be continuance of that distresse, or deliuerance from it, it will be in mercy and not in iudgement. Againe, is it so that onely by the death of Christ on the  Crosse, the rigour and curse of the Law is remooued and taken away; then let vs know, that if wee looke for free∣dome from the curse of the Law, it must be by faith in the death of Christ,If wee looke for freedome from the curse of the law, it must bee by faith in the death of Christ. euen by faith in Christ crucified onely; by the death of Christ on the Crosse is the curse of the Lawe remoued; so farre forth then as we haue part in his death by faith, so far we are freed from the curse of the Law, & that wee deceiue not our selues in this point; (for heerein euery one will flatter and sooth vp himselfe, and thinke that he hath faith in the blood of Christ, and presume to come to the Sacrament, wherein faith is especially dire∣cted to the passion of Christ) That we therefore deceiue not our selues,Speciall dire∣ctions in this point. know it for a truth, wee can neuer haue faith in the bloud of Christ vn∣lesse we be further enlightned then nature can afford, & be made to see the sinnes of our hearts and liues; yea, to see our particular sinnes: the vilest wretch that liues can in generall say, he is a sinner, but our sight of sinne must bee speciall; we must see our particular sinnes, and wee must see them together with the curse and iudgements of God, attending vpon them; that we may be humbled for them, and finde our selues stand in need of the blood of Christ, for the pardon of them: many mens consciences can tell
them of their particular sinnes, and yet they are not hum∣bled for them, what is the cause? Surely, because they see them not together with the curse of God due vnto them, they blesse themselues in their hearts, and say, wee shall haue peace, although wee walke according to stub∣bornesse of our owne hearts, thus adding drunkennesse to thirst, as it is, Deut. 29.19. Men naturally say in their hearts the curses of the Law are foolishnes, and deride the iudgements threatned against them for their sinnes, with the wicked which say, Isay 5.19. Let him make speed, let him hasten his worke that we may see it, and let the coun∣cell of the of the holy one of Israel draw neere and come, that we may know it. Labour then to see thy particular sins, and to see them together with the curse due vnro them, that so thou maist be humbled and find thy selfe stand in need of the blood of Christ, this is the way to prepare thy heart for the worke of faith; and if thy heart be thus prepared and humbled, no doubt the Lord will worke faith in thee, to apprehend the merit of Christ his death for the pardon of thy sins and thou shalt be freed from the curse of the Law, and then thou comming to the Sacrament shalt to thy com∣fort find thy faith in the bloud of Christ strengthened and confirmed; and the Sacrament shall be to thee a seale of that righteousnesse that is by faith in Christ Iesus. VER. 15. And hath spoiled the principalities and powers, and hath made a shew of them openly; and hath triumphed ouer them in the same crosse. In this Verse is a further amplification of the effect of Christ his death on the Crosse spoken of in the Verse be∣fore, and that by a comparison of the greater to the lesse on this manner. Christ by his death on the Crosse hath not onely cancelled the hand-writing that was against vs
and taken that out of the way and fastned it vpon his crosse, but by the same death hath vanquished the Deuill, and the powers of Hell, and triumphed ouer them. Wherein is also a preuention of a secret obiection tou∣ching the ignominy of the Crosse; for some might hap∣pily thinke in that Christ was brought to that ignomini∣ous and cursed death of the Crosse, that the Deuils had a great hand ouer him; this the Apostle preuents setting against it Christ his victory and triumph on the Crosse, that thereby he foiled them, and gaue them their vtter o∣uerthrow, and had a full, absolute, and glorious victory, and conquest ouer them; that is the dependance of this Verse on the former and the summe of it. Now this victory and triumph is in this verse set out by things Christ did on the Crosse: as First, that he spoiled his and our enemies, the Deuils,  which are heere by way of amplification, of Christ his might and power in preuailing ouer them, said to be Prin∣cipalities and powers. Secondly, that he made an open shew of them, and Thirdly, that he triumphed ouer them, and all these  things are spoken by way of similitude or allusion to the manner of the heathen triumphes. That as in heathen triumphes among the Ro∣manes, and others, the chiefe generals and lea∣ders being ouercome and taken captiues and prisoners, had their armour taken from them, their hands bound behinde them, and made to their publike shame to follow, or to goe be∣fore the conquerour, mounted on his most glorious and triumphing Chariot. Euen thus Christ tooke all the Deuils in hell prisoners, disarmed them and led them in trumph like slaues with their hands as it were bound behinde them, mounted on the Crosse, as on a roiall Chariot triumphing ouer them.
That is the generall meaning of the Apostle in the words of this Verse. Come we to the handling of them more particularly in the same order they are laid downe by the Apostle.Interpreta∣tion. As first, that Christ spoiled the Principalities and pow∣ers; the word translated spoiled, doth properly signifie stripped or made naked, and being heere applyed to ene∣mies ouercome by Christ, it signifieth, that hee disarmed them, puld off their armour, tooke from them all their weapons, and left them naked and spoiled of all power to hurt. (The Principalities and powers.) To passe by all curi∣ous speculations touching these words, wee are to vnder∣stand by them the Deuill and his Angels, who are said to be Principalities and powers, because of their power which they exercise ouer the wicked: in which respect they are said to bee, Ephes. 6.12. Worldly gouernours, the prin∣ces of the darkenesse of this world, spirituall wickednesse in high places blinding the mindes, and hardening the hearts of the wicked. Thus then conceiue we these words as if the Apostle had said. And hath disarmed the Deuill and his Angels who are mighty and powerfull in the children of disobedience, and taken from them their weapons, and left them as it were naked, and voide of all meanes to doe hurt. First obserue wee heere in generall the Apostles ampli∣fication of the effect of Christ his death on the crosse, hee saith that Christ, by his death hath not onely cancelled the hand-writing that was against vs, but (which is more) hath vanquished the Diuell and his Angels, thus the Apostle goes on from the lesser to the greater, and from the greater concludes the lesser. That Christ hauing spoiled the principalities and pow∣ers, hath certainely cancelled the hand-writing of ordi∣nances, &c.
Hence we may gather thus much; That is a good argu∣ment  and sound kinde of reasoning to reason from the vi∣ctory ouer sinne and Satan to the remoouall and taking a∣way of the curse.Such as finde the power of Satan vanqui∣shed in them∣selues may thence cer∣tainely con∣clude that the curse of the law is remoo∣ued from thē and that their sinnes are pardoned. If any man finde the power of Satan van∣quished in himselfe, hee may thence certainely conclude the remoouall of the curse from him and the pardon of his sinnes. It is the Apostles manner of reasoning in this place, and as Dauid sayd Psal. 41.11. by this I know that thou fauou∣rest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph ouer me. So without question may a man that findes that the Diuell the enemy of his soule doth not tyrannize ouer him nor exercise his power in him carrying his heart after sinne, but his power is weakened, and his dominion ouercome in him that man may safely say. By this I know my sinnes are forgiuen and I am in Gods fauour. When therefore thou findest that Satans dominion is  impaired in thee,Comfort to such as finde Satans power weakened in themselues. and that he cannot preuaile with thee to make thee fall into presumptuous sinnes, but thou hast strength of faith to repell and quench his firy darts (that is) sudden, strong and dangerous temptations make thy ad∣uantage of it, and say to the comfort of thine owne soule. Certainely I am free from the curse of the law and my sinnes are forgiuen. Come we to a more special consideration of the words, and first consider we the word (spoyled) the Apostle sayth, Christ hath spoyled the principalities and powers, that is, as we haue heard before, hath stripped or disarmed them,  and left them naked and spoiled of all power to do harme:The Diuell & his Angels are stripped of all their power against Gods chosen by the death of Christ. by this manner of speaking wee are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That Christ by his death hath taken from the Deuill & his Angels, their power they had against Gods chosen, by his death hee hath stripped them, and left them as it were naked creatures, not able to do the least hurt to Gods cho∣sen,
so much is tendred to vs vnder the word (spoiled) and we are to consider it; and that we mistake it not, but may rightly conceiue this doctrine, we must consider what po∣wer the Diuell had against Gods chosen before the death of Christ,What power the Diuell had against Gods chosen before the death of Christ. and how that power is taken away by Christ his death; for the vnderstanding of this know we, that all de∣scending of Adam and Eue by naturall generation are guilty of their first sinne and borne vncleane sinners, and the iustice of God is such, that where there is guiltinesse of sinne there is damnation due, all then being guilty of sinne deseruing damnation, the Diuell hee stands before God day and night, requiring euen by the iustice of God that all should be damned in hell for euer; Heerein then stands the power of the Diuell against Gods chosen, he had power to accuse them in regard of their guiltinesse of sinne, and had power vnder a certaine right of Gods iustice (for the Lord cannot deny iustice and right because hee cannot deny himselfe) to require their damnation, this power the Diuell had against Gods chosen before the death of Christ. Now this power is taken away by Christ his death, on this manner. How the Di∣uels power a∣gainst Gods chosen is taken away.The Lord Iesus tooke all the sinnes and guiltinesse of Gods chosen vpon him, and did beare them in his body on the tree, he suffered all the wrath and torments due for the same, and so with his owne precious bloud washed them and made them cleane from all guilt, and they being wa∣shed and made cleane from guiltinesse and sinne, all the Diuels power to accuse and require sentence of condem∣nation against them is taken away. Thus we are especially to vnderstand this doctrine. That Christ by his death hath taken from the Diuell and his Angels their power to hurt Gods chosen. And this is chiefely intended by the Apostle in this, when he saith, Christ hath spoiled the Diuell and his An∣gels, but withall wee are further to vnderstand that Christ by his death hath taken away the Diuels power to hurt
Gods chosen either by temptation or persecution▪ howsoe∣uer he is still suffered to tempt them, and to persecute them with cruell torments,Note. because the Lord in his infinite wis∣dome will not haue Christ his power in this respect to shew it selfe foorth at once but by degrees, and in some measure for the time, and then perfectly to take effect when all the dead shall be raised, and Christ haue all his enemies made his footestoole, 1. Cor. 15.25. albeit I say the Diuell be still suffred to tempt and persecute Gods chosen, yet his power to hurt them in regard of their saluation, their right & title to eternall life & blessed estate in heauen is taken away, he cannot by any temptation or persecution pluck out of Christ his hands, so much as one soule of Gods chosen. Thus then conceiue we this doctrine. That Christ by his death hath taken from the Diuell and his Angels their power to accuse and re∣quire the sentence of condemnation against Gods chosen; yea, their power to hurt any of Gods chosen either by temptation or perse∣cution in regard of right and title, and certaine hope of life and saluation is taken away. That is the doctrine, and to manifest this to bee a trueth consider we these places of Scripture; Gen. 3, 15. wee haue it in the promise and promulgation of the Gospell by God himselfe, that the seed of the woman (that is) Christ should giue him a deadly blow, breake his power and strength, so as he should neuer bee able to recouer it, and that hee should onely bruise the heele of Christ (that is) only touch and try some weake members of Christ by many tempta∣tions but not be able to hurt them Heb. 2.14. we are taught that this promise was accomplished by the death of Christ, and that Christ through death destroied him that had the power of death (that is) the Diuell, and deliuered them which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage, Reuel. 12.10.11. after the battell betweene Michael and the great Dragon (that is) betweene Christ
and the Diuell, Christ ouercomming Iohn sayth, I heard a loud voice▪ saying, now is saluation in Heauen, & strength and the Kingdome of our God, & the power of his Christ, for the accuser of our brethren is cast downe, which accu∣sed them before our God day and night. But they ouer∣came him by the bloud of the Lambe, and by the word of their testimony, Ioh. 12.31. our Sauiour saith now shall the Prince of this world be cast out and presently hee sub∣ioynes, and I, if I were lift vp from the earth, will draw all men vnto me, signifying that by his lifting vp on the crosse the Prince of this world (that is the Diuell should bee cast out, these are plaine euidences and proofes of this poynt. That Christ by his death hath spoiled the Di∣uell and his Angels, and taken from them their power against Gods chosen to hurt them. First, this serues notably for the comfort of them that truely beleeue in Christ,Comfort to the true mem∣bers of Christ when they haue to deale with the Di∣uell they must remember they haue to deale with an enemy alrea∣dy ouercome, and let none but such take hold of it, let not such as are of the Diuell, as S. Iohn sayth 1. Epist. 3.8. such as make a trade & common practise of sin think to finde comfort in this doctrine they are not within the compasse of it, it belongs onely to the members of Christ, and let them know for their comfort▪ that Christ by his death hath spoyled the Diuell and his Angels of their po∣wer, so as now the Diuell cannot accuse them of sinne, and they hauing to deale with the Diuell (as at one time or o∣ther hee will bee tempering with them) they must re∣member they haue to deale with a naked creature, with an enemy indeede, but already ouercome they neede no more, but as it were set their feete on his necke as Iosuah commanded his captaines to set their feete on the necke of the Kings he had vanquished, Iosu. 10.24 though the Diuell doe many waies tempt and try thee, thou being a member of Christ, yea, though he lay siege to thy soule and conscience, to bring thee to despaire, and the Lord suffer him for a time to carry a strong hand ouer thee for
some good cause knowen to himselfe, euen to fight against thee with the terrours of God, yet know it for a truth, hee shall neuer preuaile against thee to thy destruction, after a while the power of the Lord Iesus will shew it selfe, and in the end he shall tread downe Satan vnder thy feet, as saith the Apostle, Rom. 16.20. and that speech of the Apostle is woorthy obseruation, hee sayth not the God of peace the Lord Iesus shall tread Satan vnder his feet, but hee shall bring him vnder our feet, he shall shortly make all that be¦leeue in him, to tread vpon Satan, and to trample him vn∣der their feet, what an excellent comfort is this for all that truely beleeue in Christ, let them to their comfort medi∣tate heereupon. Againe, is it so that Christ by his death hath spoyled Sa∣tan,  stripped him of all his power, then learne we how wee may bee enabled to ouercome the Diuell, it must bee by faith in the bloud of Iesus Christ.The way to ouercome the Diuell is by faith in the bloud of Iesus Christ. Christ hath ouercome Satan by his death, and from thence must we deriue pow∣er to ouercome him, if we would be armed to fight and get victory ouer the Diuell, it must be by faith in the death of Christ. And hence no doubt it is that men are easily foy∣led and doe soone yeeld to the least allurement and temp∣tation of Satan, because they want faith in the blood of Christ, we shall heare a man sometimes say, Oh, I would leaue my swearing, my drunkennes, or put away my rash anger, or the like, but alas I am such a weake and forgetfull creature I cannot doe it; doest thou (whosoeuer thou art) speake in good earnest, wouldst thou indeed leaue thy sin, and of weake be made strong to ouercome it; learne then how thou mayst be so, from the mouth of the holy Ghost, he hath taught thee, Heb. 11.34. that by faith in Christ of weake thou mayst be made strong they are the very words of the holy Ghost in that place, and Saint Iohn 1. Epist. 5.4. sayth, this is our faith, by faith in Christ we shall be able to ouercome the world, yea the Prince of this world the Di∣uell, and to withstand his temptations.
Labour then to get faith in the death of Christ on the crosse, and thou shalt thence draw downe not onely com∣fort but strength against sinne and Satan; and know it for a truth, though thou beest one of Gods chosen, and Christ hath by his death disarmed the Diuell, yet to thee it is not effectuall, till thou come to haue faith in his death, till then the Diuell hath power to tempt thee, and to ouercome thee, therefore neuer rest till thou finde that thou hast faith in the bloud of Christ, and assurance that thy sinnes are wa∣shed away in his bloud, and then thou shalt be sure to find strength against sinne, Satan, and all the enemies of thy saluation. The next thing hence offered to be considered is from the words (principalities and powers) in that the Apostle calles the Diuell and his Angels (principalities and pow∣ers) it is plaine they are not as some haue thought,The errour of the Saduces conuinced. euill af∣fections and wicked thoughts, it was the errour of the Sa∣duces Act. 23.8. they thought the Diuels were nothing but euill affections and wicked thoughts, but they are plaine∣ly conuinced of errour, by this and many other places of Scripture, but that by the way: that which wee are from these words to consider is this. That notwithstanding Christ by his death hath spoyled the deuill and his angels in regard of their power against Gods chosen, yet they are still mighty and powerfull o∣uer the wicked.Though the deuill and his angels bee stripped of their power against Gods chosen, yet they are still mighty and powerfull ouer the wicked. The deuill is still a mighty prince exerci∣sing his power and tyrannie ouer the wicked, he holding vp his scepter in their hearts; he still hath power to blind their mindes and to harden their hearts, and to lead them into all kind of impietie and sinne; the Apostle saith Eph. 2.2. he is the prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, euen now since the comming of Christ in the flesh; yea the de∣uill doth exercise greater power and tyrannie ouer the wic∣ked since the death of Christ, than hee did before, Reuel. 12.12. Wee finde in that song of victorie after Christ
had vanquished the deuill, there is a calling vpon the hea∣uens, and vpon them that dwell in them, to reioyce for the victorie, and a woe proclaimed to the inhabitants of the earth, and why so? the reason is giuen, the deuill is come downe vnto them, hauing great wrath, knowing that hee hath but a short time; The meaning is, though Satan, before Christ ouercame him by his death, was a∣mong the inhabitants of the earth, euen such as haue their portion in this life, yet now being ouercome and stripped of his power against Gods chosen, he comes downe more heauy and in more tyrannous sort vpon them than before, and their woe is as it were doubled by Christ his victorie, Satan being now out of all hope to impugne and pull downe the saluation of Gods chosen, hee will wreake his ire vpon the inhabitants of the earth, hee will exercise his power ouer them to the full, and lead them deeper into all horrible sinne and condemnation, and make them runne greedily vpon their owne destruction. Wee are not therefore to maruell at it, that the deuill  rageth more in these daies,It is no matter of wonder, that the deuill rageth more in these daies then in for∣mer times. and makes men now breake out into greater outrage of sinne than in former ages; he is now come downe among the inhabitants of the earth, in this latter age of the world, in more tyrannous manner, and the elder the world waxeth, the more the deuill ra∣geth, and the more he rageth the more his strength encrea∣sed, for anger being the whetstone of strength sharpens it,Note therefore maruell not at it, that wicked men are now more shamelesse in sinne then in former times, rather let vs mar∣uell at this, that the sunne that hath beene witnesse of so many fowle sinnes (for men now shame not to sinne in the open sunne-light they declare their sinnes as Sodome, they hide them not Isa. 3.9.) that the sunne I say falles not downe from heauen, and that the earth opens not her mouth to swallow vs vp, and that the Lord Iesus comes not downe in flaming fire to burne both heauen and earth and to giue the wicked their portion in the lake that bur∣neth
fire and brimstone, wee may now iustly euery day looke for his comming to make an end of these wretched and sinnefull dayes. Againe, is it so, that the Diuell notwithstanding the death of Christ doth stil,Such as now finde them∣selues vnder the power of the Diuell, are in a most fear∣full estate. exercise his power ouer the wic∣ked, and his tyranny greater ouer them since the death of Christ then before, then let such as finde themselues now in this time of the Gospell, vnder the power of the Diuell, such as are now blind and ignorant, such as are now sence∣lesse and secure wordlings such as now are giuen ouer to sensuality and drunkennes, to pride, to whoredome, or a∣ny knowne sinne, let them consider in what a fearefull e∣state they are, their case is now worse then the case of infi∣dels, & of heathen men before the comming of Christ in regard of the deuils power ouer them, now his tyranny doubled vpon them, & it is now harder to escape out of his hands them is was before the death of Christ. Men com∣monly promise to themselues, now in the time of the Gos∣pel, an easie escape out of their sins, and a ready repentance when they will; yea, when they are most weake, euen gasping for breath on their death-bed, but alasse, they de∣ceiue themselues, and therein doth the Deuill shew his power ouer them in possessing their hearts with such de∣ceiuing thoughts, know it for a truth, and consider it wic∣ked man or woman, whosoeuer thou art, the Deuill is now more mad against thee then if thou hadst liued before the comming of Christ, and therefore will not easily let thee slip out of his hands; and let it stirre thee vp to vse all meanes possible, and with speed to be deliuered out of his power, lest then going on with hope of easie escape, the Lord in his iust iudgement giue thee vp to hardnesse of heart, and in the ende it be with thee, as it was with wicked Ahab, and hard hearted Pharaoh, that the Lord in his iustice offer thee some baite or other to pull thee on to thy destruction. Come wee to the next thing that Christ did on the
Crosse in these words, (And hath made a shew of them open∣ly) the word translated, hath made a shew of them, (for it is one word in the originall) doth signifie thus much. Hath made them a publike spectacle of scorne and de∣rision,Interpreta∣tion. he hath exposed them to shame and much disgrace (openly) the word signifies (boldly) and the meaning is publikely in the sight of many beholders, (namely) in the sight of God, his heauenly Angels, and in the sight of all that look on the death of Christ by faith; for indeed when Christ hung on the crosse, he was a spectacle of shame and contempt in the eies of the world; all that looked on him with carnall eies, mocked him, and had him in derision, but in the sight of God, his Angels, and all true beleeuers, he had glory, and the Deuill and his angels had shame; in the eies of God, and of his Angels, and all true beleeuers was Christ his victorie on the Crosse, most manifest and glorious, though in the sight of the wicked it was base and contemptible, thus then conceiue wee these words as if the Apostle had said. And hath made the Diuell and his angels a specta∣cle of shame and scorne in the eies of God, his An∣gels, and all that looke on the Crosse of Christ by faith Now hence it is cleare, that Christ by his death on the  Crosse hath shamed the Deuill and Angels;Christ by his death on the crosse shamed the Deuill. Christ his death on the crosse was not onely the Deuils spoile, strip∣ping him of his power, but it was his shame and confusion, for why? When our Sauiour was on the Crosse the deuils assaulted him most fiercely, and vsed all the strength they had to vexe and torment him: and therefore in the Psalm. 22. wherein is figured vnder the person of Dauid the pas∣sion of Christ, the Deuils are compared to dogges, to buls of Basan which tore his hands and his feete, to Lions, to Vnicornes, in regard of ther cruell vsage of him. Now this they did to this end, that they might ouercome our Sauiour, and triumph ouer him; but all in vaine, hee on
the Crosse spoiled them, ouercame them, led them cap∣tiues and triumphed ouer them, heerein then stood the shame of the Deuill, by the crosse, that by it hee was disa∣pointed of his hope and purpose against Christ, he hoped he should haue vtterly destroied him, but he was deceiued and disapointed of his hope, yea put out of all hope euer to preuaile against him, and that was his shame: for as the Apostle saith, Rom. 5.5. The hope of the godly makes them not ashamed, meaning that they cannot bee disa∣pointed of their hope, and so come to shame. Whence we may gather on the contrarie, that where hope, failes especially in great matters vndertaken, shame commeth vpon it, and so the deuill beeing disapointed of his wished and most wicked purpose in the death of Christ, was thereby shamed; yea, the death of Christ on the Crosse was his disapointement, and so was it his shame. Is it so then, that Christ his death was the Deuils shame, did Christ on the Crosse defeat the Deuill of his mischee∣uous purpose, did he then disapoint him, when the Deuill thought he had him at most aduantage, and in the very houre of darkenes, when he was deliuered into the hands of sinners? Mar. 14-41. Then let this strengthen vs in our faith in Christ at all times,The Deuill cannot possi∣bly shame any member of Christ. did Christ shame the Deuill vpon the crosse, and will he now, being exalted into heauen, suffer him to shame any of his members? No, no, it is not possible, Christ on the crosse made voide the Deuils hope, that our hope might neuer make vs ashamed; be strong then in the Lord Iesus, whosoeuer thou art that hast any measure of faith in his bloud, and remember when thou hast to deale with the Deuill, thou hast to do with a shamed creature, if thou hold out the bloud of Christ, and come against the Deuil, in the glory of his crosse, the Deuill will bee ashamed to looke on thee; yea, dastardlike he will hide his head, hee will not abide the sight of thee, and this is a sweet medi∣tation,
let all such as truely beleeue in Christ therein exer∣cise themselues. Againe, in that Christ his death was the Deuils shame, we learne how we may come to shame the Deuill in the  sight of God, it must bee by faith in Christ his death,By faith in Christ his death we may come to shame the de∣uill in Gods sight. by fetching our glory from his Crosse, it may not be by stan∣ding on any worth or excellency in our selues: no, no, in this case the common saying is true, Confesse the truth and shame the Diuell, we must confesse, we deserue nothing by the best thing in vs, but shame and confusion, if the Lord should deale with vs in his iustice: and seeke onely to the Crosse of Christ for our glory, and say with the Apostle Gal. 6.14. God forbid, that I should reioice but in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world, and then wee shall be able to put the Deuill to shame. One thing more we are to obserue from these words, the Apostle saith, Christ by his death made the Deuil a∣shamed openly, that is, as we haue heard, boldly, publik∣ly, in the sight of God, of his Angels, and of all that looke on the Crosse of Christ by faith. Note wee then thus much. That the Deuils shame by the Crosse of Christ, is  an open shame it appeares,The Deuils shame by the Crosse of Christ, is an open shame. to God, to his Angels; yea to all that by faith looke on his Crosse. No doubt the Apostle had his eie vpon it, when hee said, 1 Cor. 2.2. He esteemed not to know any thing saue Iesus Christ and him crucified; hee thought nothing so worthy to be knowne as the glorious death of Christ. If we then see not the glory of Christ on the Crosse,  and the Deuils shame, yea if we see it not with delight and ad∣miration, as it said of the Angels, 1 Pet. 1.12. They de∣sire to behold the things of the Gospell and see them with admiration, we haue no faith in the death of Christ,If wee see not Christ his glory and the Deuils shame in the Crosse of Christ, wee haue no faith in the death of Christ. yea, let me tell you more, if we see not Christ his glory and the Deuils shame, set before vs in the preaching of the Gospel
and administration of the Sacraments (for therein is Christ crucified set before vs, Gal 3.1.) If wee take no delight in seeing by the eie of our soules the glorious shew that is set before vs in these things, but we turne our backes vpon them, or our hearts, are heauy and dull and not affected with them, and wee haue no delight in them, it is more then a probable argument, wee haue no faith in the death of Christ. It is a wonder to see, how many men and women are carried after vaine shewes and spectacles, and how they delight in them, how they runne after a may-game, or the like, it is because they are not able to see better things. Pray then that thine eies may be opened to see that glori∣ous shew Christ Iesus made vpon the Crosse, and that thou maiest delight morein that, then in all the glittering shewes of the world, otherwise thou canst looke for no comfort in that glorious and triumphant death of Christ. Come we to the third thing Christ did on the Crosse in the last words of this verse. (And hath triumphed ouer them in the same Crosse.) Some reade the words thus (And hath triumphed ouer them in himselfe.) But I take this rea∣ding (hath triumphed ouer them in the same Crosse) to be more agreeable to the context and scope of the Apo∣stle, though the word Crosse be not found in the original, yet it is to be vnderstood and may truely bee supplied, as we haue it in our English translation. For when did Christ spoile Satan and destroy his pow∣er, but when he suffered death on the Crosse, as is plaine, Heb. 2.14. and then also he triumphed ouer him. Now the Apostles meaning in saying Christ triumphed ouer them is this. Interpreta∣tion.That Christ by his death not onely ouercame the deuil and his Angels and stripped them of all power to hurt Gods chosen, but in his death he got himselfe honour and glory ouer the Deuill, and he did as Conquerours vse to
doe in their triumphes, that as they riding in triumphe make knowne their power and vertue ouer their enemies to their greater glory: so Christ on his crosse to his great glory did manifest and make knowne his power ouer the Deuill; he therein made his glorious power ouer the De∣uill and his Angels fully appeare, both to God, to his An∣gels, and to all that looke on his crosse by faith, and that was his triumph, hee on the crosse shewed himselfe more powerfull then the Deuill, and stronger then all the pow∣ers of hell; yea, therein he manifested the power of his Godhead, for though he cried with strong cries and teares and sweat drops of blood, and cried out that God had forsaken him, yet his Godhead sustained him, and euen then by the power of his Godhead hee vttered words of faith and confidence, and said, My God, my God, in his greatest agony, he shewed himselfe stronger then the De∣uill and his Angels, and ouercame them, and so had the glory of a full victory and conquest ouer them. Thus then conceiue we these words as if the Apostle had said. And in the same death on the Crosse hath mani∣fested and made his power ouer the Deuill and his Angels fully to appeare and gotten himselfe glory ouer them in the sight of God, his Angels, and all that looke one his Crosse by faith. Hence it is most cleare, that Christ by his death hath  gotten a full and absolute victory ouer the Deuill and his Angels, for triumph euer followeth victory.Christ by his death hath gotten a full and absolute victory ouer the Deuill and his angels. No man of any wisdome will triumph and boast himselfe before the victory. When Ben-hadad King of Aram comming to battell against the King of Israel boasted himselfe that the dust of Samaria should not bee enough for all the people that followed him, for euery man an handfull, 1. King. 20.10.11. The King of Israel returned him this answer, Let not him that girdeth his harnesse boast himselfe, as he that putteth it off; giuing him to know, that he boasted vnrea∣sonably,
before his time, he triumphed, before the victory which was folly in them, for the euent of warre is vncer∣taine, and triumph euer followes victorie. Christ there∣fore hauing triumphed ouer the Deuill and his Angels in his crosse, it is most certaine, he had therein a full victory and conquest ouer the powers of hell, and that makes for our exceeding great comfort. That Christ by his death hath made a ful and per∣fect satisfaction to God for the sinnes of his cho∣sen,  Chist by his death hath made a full & perfect satisfa∣ction, for the sinnes of Gods chosen. yea Christ his obedience satisfactory was ful∣lie accomplished on the Crosse. And so are we to vnderstand that speech of our Saui∣our in his giuing vp the Ghost, Iohn 14.30. It is finished meaning that his satisfactory obedience was then fully ended, and without question hee could not triumphe be∣fore he had made a full and perfect satisfaction for vs. Obiection:  it may be said, whereto then serues Christ his resurrection, ascension, and sitting at the right hand of his Father? I answer,  they serue not to satisfie for sinnes, but to ap∣ply vnto as many as truely beleeue his perfect satisfaction made on the Crosse, and to put them in possession of the benefits of Christ his passion, Rom. 4.25. the Apostle saith Christ was deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen aganie for our iustification, (that is) both to testifie his per∣fect obedience, and to apply it to vs by his Spirit to our iustification. And the Apostle, Ephes. 4.10. saith, Christ ascended that hee might fill all things (that is) as may appeare by the context of that place, that hee might fill Gods elect with all gifts of his spirit, needfull to their saluation and so worke faith in them to apprehend the merit of his death to their iustification, wee are then to hold it for a certaine truth, that Christ his death on the crosse was a perfect sa∣tisfaction to God for the sinnes of his chosen and therein he ended his satisfactory obedience, and wee are to re∣nounce
all other expiatory sacrifice whatsoeuer they bee, they doe much derogate from Christ his victory and tri∣umph on the crosse;Popish expia∣tory sacrifices doe much de∣rogate from Christ his tri∣umph on the Crosse- and such as maintaine them are ene∣mies to the crosse of Iesus Christ. The next thing heere offred to our consideration is this. That Christ his crosse was as it were his triumphing cha∣riot, whence wee may easily see that Christ got himselfe  glory ouer his enemies not out of that which is glorious, but out of that which in it selfe is shamefull and ignomini∣ous, he got himselfe glory out of ignominie,Christ got himselfe glory not out of that which is glori∣ous, but out of his ignomi∣nious death on the crosse. it is the vsuall manner of working with the Lord to bring one contrary out of another, especially when hee hath any excellent thing to worke to his owne glory. In the first creation hee made something, yea, all thinges of nothing,Note. he commanded the light to shine out of darkenesse 2. Cor. 4.6. in the preseruation of his people, hee caused the wa∣ter to come out of a rocke, Numb. 20.22. In the worke of the conuersion of a sinner, ordinarily he workes by the preaching of the word, which is as contrary to nature; as fire to water, for there is no seed of faith in nature & prech∣ing is folishnesse to the naturall man, and it is most cleere from this text, that the Lord Iesus brought life out of death yea, out of his ignominious and cursed death of the crosse hee got himselfe exceeding great glory in the sight of God his Angels and of all that with the eye of faith behold his crosse, and this himselfe foretold, Ioh. 13.31.32. that God should be glorified in him, in his death, that the pow∣er of his God-head, should then manifestly appeare, as in∣deede  it did and was testified by many signes,Christ will be exceedingly glorified whē he shall come to iudgement in rendring vengeance to the diuell and to all the wic∣ked. as by dark∣ning of the sunne, the trembling of the earth, by cleauing a sunder of rocks by the rising of some dead bodies, by ren∣ding asunder the vaile of the temple which drew from the Centurion a plaine confession, certainly this man was the son of God, a thing very worthy our serious meditation. Is it so then that Christ triumphed & got himselfe glo∣ry ouer the Diuell and his Angels out of his crosse euen
then when hee suffered that shamefull and ignominious death on the crosse? Oh then how will he be glorified when hee shall come with power and glory to judgement with thousands of his Angels, how shall hee then get himselfe glory in rendring vengeance to the Diuell, and to all wic∣ked imps the instruments and limbs of the Diuell? wicked men happily thinke because Christ is a Sauiour therefore he will be a mild and fauourable iudge, and not deale with them in rigour and seuerity, but let them know, that when hee shall put on his garment dipt in bloud as wee haue it, Reuel. 19.3. when hee shall arise and take hold of Iudge∣ment they shall finde him a most terrible God of venge∣ance; if he that is a sweet and comfortable Sauiour become bitter and terrible,Note. surely, his bitternesse and terror will be intollerable, and he will be most dreadfull to all his ene∣mies, euen to all such as impugne and hinder the course of his Gospell, yea, as the Apostle saith, 2. Thess. 1.8. to all that know not God, and which obey not vnto the Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ; let all ignorant persons then & all hard hearted sinners thinke vpon it, and in feare la∣bour to make this terrible iudge their glorious and com∣fortable Sauiour. Againe, is it so that Christ got himselfe glory euen out of his ignominious death on the crosse, then let all true mem∣bers of Iesus Christ, know to their cōfort that he now raig∣ning in Heauen will worke their glory out of their suffe∣rings be they neuer so shamefull,Christ will work the glo∣ry of all his true members out of their suffering be they neuer so shamefull. yea, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 8.7. through him they shall be more then conque∣rours, they shall be triumphers in their sufferings, he will supply to them such strength of faith and patience as their very enemies shall stand amazed and wonder at them, and say, as the chiefe Priests and Scribes sayd, Act, 4.16. what shall we doe to these men, a speech woorthy obseruati∣on, they that had power to imprison the Apostles, or to doe with them what they would, stand agast and at their wits end, and know not what to doe to poore, weake, vn∣armed
and friendlesse men, a strange thing, and such a thing as nature, reason and the world vnderstands not. Thus no doubt will the Lord Iesus shew foorth his power in all his members, as hee got himselfe glory out of his owne cursed death, so certainely will he shew his power, & be glorified in thy sufferings if thou belong to him; it is a shrewd euidence, men belong not to Christ, when vnder the crosse they rage and storme, and foame out their owne shame, the folly and corruption of their owne hearts, if thou belong to Christ, Christ will be glorified in thee, not onely in thy actions, but in thy passions, in thy sufferings, also he will manifest his power in thy patience, faith and constancy vnder the crosse, he will make thee more then a conquerour in thy greatest afflictions. Obserue wee further, that when Christ in the eye of the world had shame, and seemed to be ouercome, then had he glory, he vanquished and triumphed ouer his enemies in his crosse, hence wee are to take out this point of in∣struction. That wee are not to iudge of any by the outward  appearance.We are not to iudge of any by the out∣ward appea∣rance. It is our Sauiours owne rule Ioh. 7.24. iudge not accor∣ding to the appearance, but iudge righteous iudgement and the reason  of this is giuen Eccles. 9.1. no man know∣eth either loue or hatred of all that is before them (that is to say by the consideration of outward things it cannot be gathered whom God doth loue or hate, indeed wee may, and ought to despise a vile person, Psal. 15.4. whether rich or poore, for his vilenesse, yet may we not iudge him vile  before the time, (that is to say) before the Lord haue disco∣uered him to be so by his fruits, it is the corruption of our nature to iudg both our selus & others by the outwatd state in this lifeReproofe of such as iudge both them∣selues & others by their out∣ward estate in this life. to thinke if a man thriue in the world then God loues him, and if he be crossed in outward things then God hates him. But we must learne to reforme our iudgement in this point and know that outward prosperity or aduer∣sity
are leadē rules to iudg by; it is no good argumēt to say God loues vs because we prosper in the world; or he hates vs because we are crossed in outward things; no, no, wee are to looke into the causes and qualification of the mind, repentance, or hardnesse and continuance in sinne: if wee finde the latter of these howsoeuer we prosper: yet let vs know it is not a blessing but a curse, and it comes indeede from the prouidence of God, but to make his iudgement iust when it falles vpon vs, by reason of our abuse of his mercy. Let vs then striue after this grace, that wee may iudge a∣right both of our selues and others, and especially in time of affliction, it is a singular grace of God to iudge rightly of others in time of affliction, Dauid pronounceth a bles∣sing on him that iudgeth wisely of the poore, Psal. 41.1. blessed is hee that iudgeth wisely of the poore: the Lord shall deliuer him in the time of trouble, &c. If wee iudge the poore the worse because of his pouerty, or more hardly iudg of any because he is afflicted be it one that hath been in our knowledge guilty of some great sinne (as wee are ready to say if we see one whom we haue knowen guilty of some fowle sinne to bee afflicted, I knew it would come home to him, the Lord would plague him and not suffer him to goe vnpunished) if wee thus iudge of the afflicted, we may happily sinne against the generation of Gods chil∣dren, as Dauid saith, Psal. 73.15. for the Lord may haue pardoned that sinne, and wee iudging him plagued for it, we condemne him whom God hath acquitted, and that is a fearefull presumption and such as cannot escape the pu∣nishing hand of God. Let vs therefore learne to contemne a vile person disco∣uered to be so for his vilenesse, but take heed we iudge of no man by the outward appearance, iudge wisely of the poore and afflicted that wee may bee blessed of the Lord, and that he in mercy may deliuer vs in the time of our own troubles.
VER. 16. Let no man therefore condemne you in meat & drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabboth dayes, In this verse we haue the Apostles conclusion of his re∣futation of legall ceremonies which were vrged on the Co∣lossians by false teachers, as of necessary vse to saluation for the Apostle began to deale in particular against those ceremonies verse 11. and from that verse to this hath pro∣ued by many arguments. That there is perfect saluation, and all things needfull to saluation to be found in Christ, and that in him such as be∣leeue are compleat and haue all perfection. Therefore legall ceremonies are needlesse, this the A∣postle inferreth in this verse by way of dehortation, and that in regard of the premised reason; they should not let any man condemne them, touching their neglect of those legall ceremonies, and he doth insist in some certain kinds of them vrged by false teachers, and vnder them compre∣hends all the rest as may appeare by his generall reason in the verse following: He giues instance of two sorts. First, the ceremoniail choice of meats and drinkes, let no man condemne you in meat and drinke. Seeondly, the obseruation of Iewish feasts, which hee doth expresse in these particulars, holy dayes, new moones or Sabboth dayes. Come wee to consider the words of this verse as they are laid downe in order,Interpreta∣tion. and first of these words (let no man condemne you in meat and drinke) the word translated con∣demne doth properly signifie iudge; it is vsuall in Scrip∣ture put downe the one for the other; the generall word (iudge) for the speciall (condemne) wee haue it of∣ten so, Romans the 14. the same originall worde is in our English rendered, and that truely, verse 3. (iudge)
and verse 4. (condemne) for indeede the Apostles mea∣ning in saying, let no man condemne you, is let no man spend his iudgement vpon you in the woorst part let him not iudge you to sinne, and condemne you to sinne in meate and drinke (that is) touching meates and drinkes prohibited touching the vse of meats and drinkes forbid∣den by Moses Law, let no man iudge you to sinne in the vse of them. This could not bee that the Colossians or any other could hinder false teachers for iudging hardly of them for eating and drinking meates and drinkes forbidden in Moses Law. It is true indeede, they could not, therefore the Apo∣stles meaning is, they should not care for their vniust iudg∣ment spent on them, condemning them of sin when they ought not. And thus we are to conceiue these words, as if the Apo∣stle had sayd. Care not for it, regard it not, that any man doth iudge you faulty and condemn you of sinne for ea∣ting and drinking meats and drinkes forbidden in the Law of Moses that iudgement and condemna∣tion of you is vniust. Now in the first place wee are to marke the maine of the Apostles speech, his speech is not a bare and simple admo∣tion, but a powerfull inhibition, he saith not, take heede that no man condemne you, but he deliuers his speech in maner of a law and form of a commanding iniunction; let no man condemne you &c. the Colossians were in danger to suffer false teachers to iudge and condemne them in re∣gard of legall ceremonies and to take to heart their vniust censures, the Apostle therefore interposeth his Apostoli∣call authority, whereby he had power to giue precepts bin∣ding conscience, and he enioynes them not to suffer any so to doe, let no man, sayth the Apostle condemne you, let no man lay it vpon you as a Law.
And thus the Ministers of the Gospell may exercise that  power that is giuen to them, howsoeuer they may not giue new precepts binding conscience, yet they consenting with the word of God their doctrine being grounded on the writings of the Prophets & Apostles they may charge it on the consciences of men, and by way of iniunction as occasion is offered, say let this bee done or let that bee auoided.Though the Ministers of the Gospell may not giue new precepts binding con∣sciences yet their doctrine being groun∣ded on the written word of God may be charged vpon mens consciences & they may en∣ioyne this to be done or that to be a∣uoided. The Apostle hath taught vs that it is a part of the ministeriall office to be instant, 2. Tim. 4.2. and that must be by commanding, vrging, perswading, and forbidding, &c. as occasion is offered, and especially then may the Mi∣nisters of the Gospell vse this manner of speaking, when they see their people in danger to reuolt from the truth, & to be seduced, they may then be instant with them, & lay it as a law on their consciences, and say, let no man seduce you, let no man draw you away from the truth, and thus must I needs at this time frame & addresse my speech to some in our Church, I see some amongst vs in danger to be seduced & led aside into that dangerous schisme of Brow∣nisme,Particular ap∣plication to some being in danger to bee led aside into that dange∣rous schisme of Brownism. to such therefore I speake,  let them consider what I say, and the Lord giue them a right vnderstanding in all things. Wee in this Church of England haue (blessed be God for it) the truth of religion held, taught and professed, yea, the Brownists themselues cannot deny but that the whole fundamentall substance of truth is amongst vs, yea, I dare be bold to say futher, in the word of truth, and in the name of God, and to pawne mine owne soule vpon it, wee haue the substance of the truth grounded on the written word of the Prophets and the Apostles, and therefore vpon this ground I must charge thee whosoeuer thou art, that art wauering, and in danger to be seduced & drawn to Brow∣nisme, and lay it a law vpon thy soule and conscience, let no man seduce thee, and draw thee away from the truth of religion held and professed amongst vs, it is a saying wor∣thy to be remembred, and often thought on, that in diuine
matters, in matters of so high a nature as is religion, no consultation is to be vsed, stand not thou now to consult of a charge of religion, but be resolued of the truth held and professed, and tread vnder foot all perswasions to the con∣trary whatsoeuer; and thus I thought good to speake, oc∣casioned from the manner of the Apostles speech in this place. Now from the matter of this powerfull iniunction, in that the Apostle saith, let no man condemne you in meat and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the newe  moone, or of the Sabboth dayes; wee may easily gather that it is the nature of an erroneous spirit, of a false teacher, to iudge and condemne men, and that chiefely for out∣ward thingsIt is the pro∣perty of falsē teachers to iudge & con∣demne men chiefely for the vse or neg¦lect of out∣ward things. in respect of meate, drinke, obseruation of dayes and the like. Therefore the Apostle giueth the Co∣lossians a countermand, and enioynes them not to suffer any false teachers to ioyne with them, yea, it is the proper∣ty of a false teacher, rather to iudge and condemne for the vse or neglect of outward things, then for the breach and transgression of the morall law of God, see it in one exam∣ple. The Scribes and Pharisies did more condemne for not washing hands before meat, and the neglect of other things deuised by themselues, then they did for the trans∣gression of Gods commandements, our Sauiour reproues them for it, Mat. 15. from verse 3. to the 10. Let this serue  to make knowen to vs, that the teachers among the Papists are led with a spirit of errour,Popish teach∣ers plainely discouer them¦selues to be led with a spi∣rit of errour. we shall easily find this mark on their foreheads, it is apparant euery man may see it, they more vrge their owne fleshly and ceremoniall Law worship then they doe the spirituall worship of God; yea, it is ex∣tant and to be found vpon record in thir owne stories, that men haue beene more seuerely punished for eating flesh on a friday, then for simple fornication or following strange flesh, which is a certaine note and badge of an An∣tichristian Church, learne we heereby to discerne them & to take knowledge of the spirit by which they are led, and
so according to the commandement of the Apostle in this place regard not their vniust censures, calling thee heretick and loading thee with opprobrious names; they will con∣demne thee to the pit of hell for not obseruing some rot∣ten deuise of their owne. Esteeme it not, but set light by it as the breath of men; yea, as the curse that is causeles Pro 26.2. and shall neuer come. The next thing offered to our consideration from this iniunction is the instance heere giuen by the Apo∣stle hee sayth, let no man condemne you, and hee doth instance in meate and drinke, hence wee may take vp this conclusion. That through Christ we haue free liberty in meat and  drinke;We haue free liberty throgh Christ in the vse of meat & drinke. we may freely eate any kinde of meat and drinke; any kinde of drinke; and men are not to accuse and con∣demne vs of sinne in so doing, if they doe we are not to re∣gard their censure. Among the Iewes before the comming of Christ there was a difference of meates; some were cleane, and some were vncleane and forbidden, wee may read of them Leuiticus eleuenth, thorow out, and Deutro. 14, from verse foure, to the end of the twenty & one, but now since the death of Christ all kinds of meat and drinke are left to our liberty, that difference is taken away, and as the Apostle saith, Tit. 1.15. To the pure all things are pure, and Rom. 14.14 I know saith the Apostle, and am perswa∣ded through the Lord Iesus that there is nothing vn∣cleane of it selfe, but vnto him that iudgeth any thing vncleane to him it is vncleane, and Verse 20. all things indeede are pure. The reason of this is plaine, before the comming of Christ some meates were cleane and some vncleane, to signifie a difference betweene Iewe and Gentile, and the Iewe should not communicate with the Gentile, but now by Christ that partition wall is broken downe, and of two they are made one in him, Ephes. 2.14.15. Therefore the difference of meats
is taken away, and Christians may now with good consci∣ence, with moderation eat any kind of meate, and drinke  any kind of drinke; it is therefore wicked and iniurious to Christ his death to forbid the eating of some kinde of meates at some times, as the Papists doeIt is iniurious to Christ his death to for∣bid the eating of some kinde of meats at sometimes, as the Papists do at this day, it is made by the Apostle, a badge of Antichristian apostasie, 1. Tim. 4.3. commanding to abstaine from meates which God hath created, to be receiued with giuing thankes, of them which beleeue and know the truth. Obiect:  Oh but saith the Papist we forbid not the ea∣ting of any meate as vncleane, but as vnlawfull for a time, in regard of the comandement of the Church Answ:  A meere shift, and colour of their falshood in hypocrisie: for first:, we find it in their books that flesh is forbidden, because it was accursed, and not fish in the daies of Noah, therefore they forbid it as vncleane. Againe, they forbid it for holinesse, and for religion, making it part of Gods worship to abstain from som meats at some times; therfore they condemne it as vnholy & vn∣cleane at that time, though not by creation, yet by their owne prohibition, and so their distinction is foolish and the parts of it fall one into an other, and they cannot pos∣sibly free themselues in this point from teaching a doctrin of Deuils. But will some say, may not our gouernours forbid the eating of meats at some times, and if they doe, are not wee to obey them? They may, and we are to obey them; but marke how they may forbid the eating of some kinde of meates at some times by reason of want, for maintenance of some calling in the common wealth, or for other ciuill respects, but not for religion, and herein we are to obey them. Againe, they may at some time enioine vs abstinence from this, or that kind of meate, not in regard of the kind, but in respect of the quantity, or quality of meat, that wee abstaine from our ordinary diet, and that which wee doe
eat be not of the daintiest. Dan. 10.3. In a word, they may in time of famine and scarcity enioine vs a publike fast, that we may testifie our humiliation and better attend on the exercises of the word and praier, and we are then also to obey them these cautions obserued.Cautions to be obserued in keeping a fast. First, that our fasting be voide of superstition, and that  we place no worship of God in it, but hold it onely as an helpe to further vs in the duties of Religion. Secondly, that we haue no opinion of merit by it, that  thereby we merit forgiuenesse of sinnes, encrease of grace, or the like. Thirdly, That we hold it not of absolute necessity. And lastly, that it be without breach of the rule of cha∣rity,  either hurting our selues, & making vs thereby vnfit for good duties, or giuing offence to others, such as are weake in knowledge, causing them to call our Christian liberty into question; for first, wee are to enforme them that we may thus abstaine, because the Magistrate by his authority doth not take away the vse of the things we ab∣stain from, but only order and moderat the same. Thus wee see that our Magistrates may forbidde the eating of meats at some times, and how we may also with good conscience obey them. And yet, this remaines a truth, that wee haue liberty through Christ to eat any kind of meate, and that we may not be interdicted any kind of meat, at any time, as vn∣holy or vncleane as it is among the Papists. And let vs vse this liberty, purchased by Christ, with  thanksgiuing, and in sobriety and moderation,We are to vse our Christian liberty tou∣ching meates and drinkes with thankes∣giuing and in sobriety. that by our eating and drinking we may be more fit to serue God, and to doe good duties; let vs eate in time for strength, and not for drunkennesse, Eccles. 10.17. Let vs not tire our selues with eating and drinking, and disable our selues and make our selues fit for nothing but drinking, and then pretend Christian liberty; so doing wee turne Chri∣stian liberty into vnchristian, yea brutish licence to sinne,
and we vse our liberty as an occasion to the flesh. Let this be farre from vs, and remember we the words of the holy Ghost, 1 Pet. 5.8. Bee sober and watch, for your aduersary the Deuill as a roaring Lion wal∣keth about seeking whom hee may deuoure: giuing to vnderstand, that an epicure or drunkard is a fit prey for the Deuill. Come wee to the second sort of legall Ceremonies, wherein the Apostle doth insist) namely) the obseruation of Iewish feasts in the words following. Or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabbath day. Interpreta∣tion.For the vnderstanding of these words, wee must know that the Iewes had many festiuall daies, which they were to obserue and keepe holy by the appointment of the Lord, but three speciall great feasts had they euery yeere aboue the rest, which were called solemne feasts, or holy  conuocations, (namely) The feast of * Passouer, or vn∣leauened  bread: The feast of * Pentecost, named the feast  of the first fruits: and the feast of * Tabernacles, or ga∣thering in of their fruits in the end of the yeere: wee reade of them Exod. 23. from Verse 14. to the 20. Leuit. through∣out Deut. 16. from the beginning to verse the 15. They were also appointed to offer a burnt offring vnto the Lord in the beginning of their monthes, Numb. 28.11. and they had an holy conuocation, and were to keepe the first and last day of their great feasts, as Sabbaths, we find it so Leu. 23.35.39. these things rightly conceiued, they will lead vs to the true sense and meaning of the Apostle in this place. For first, by holiday or feast, we are to vnderstand those three solemne feasts, the Passeouer, Pentecost, and the feast of Tabernacles; by new Moone, the feast they kept in the beginning of their moneth, by Sabbath daies, not the Lords ordinary Sabbath, but the first and last day
Now, whereas the Apostle saith (in respect) it may be expounded either in regard of the whole feast, or (as the o∣riginall word signifieth) in regard of part of it for happily, some amongst the Colossians did in part obserue the Iewish feasts, and in part neglect them, thus then we are to vn∣derstand these words, as if the Apostle had said. Let no man condemne you for neglect of any great feat of the Iewes, or for not obseruing their feast of the new Moone, or the first and last day of their great feasts, or briefly thus. Let no man lay sinne vpon you for neglect of any Iewish holy day either in whole or in part. Now first, from the second instance of the Apostle, in that he saith, let no man condemne you in the obseruati∣on of any Iewish feast, it is manifest and cleare. That we now through Christ since the death of Christ haue a liberty in regard of daies, wee now in that time of  the Gospell are not bound (as the Iewes were) to the ob∣seruation and keeping of any one set day aboue another excepting onely the Lords day.Through Christ wee haue free li∣berty in re∣gard of the obseruation of daies, ex∣cepting only the Lords day It is that which the Apostle findes blame-worthy in the Galatians, Gal. 4.10. That they obserued daies, and monthes, and times, and yeeres. Yea, hee saith in the verse following that he was afraid of them, lest he had bestowed his labour then in vaine; in that they did turne againe to those Iewish obseruations; and he insists in the obseruati∣on of daies, and times, and yeeres, but that we mistake not the Apostles meaning, his speech being generall. Know we that he condemnes not there the naturall ob∣seruation of daies and times, as the obseruation of daie and night, sommer and winter, haruest and seed-time, nor yet the ciuill obseruation of times, as the time of planting, setting, sowing, and plucking vp that which is planted, spoken of, Eccles. 3.2. But hee reprooues them for their obseruation of daies and times, as a thing to which they thought they were bound in conscience, and as out of ho∣linesse,
that the Apostle deales against as opposite and con∣trary to the liberty of Christians. Obiect: Rom. 14.6. The Apostle saith, He that obser¦ueth the day obserueth it in the Lord, Therefore we may now in time of the Gospell obserue a day vnto the Lord, as a part of religion and his worship? Answ: We are to consider of whom the Apostle there speakes (namely) of such as were weake, and not fully in∣structed in Christian liberty, and his meaning is, that they in their weakenesse intended to obserue a day to the ho∣nour of God, and thought they did so, but that was their weakenesse and error, and so the place makes no thing a∣gainst the truth of this conclusion. That wee now vnder the Gospell are not bound in conscience to a religious obseruation? of one set day aboue another, except onely the Lords Sabbath. How then can the Papists iustifie their festiuall daies, and their set solemnities,Confuation of Popish fe∣stiuall daies vrged by the Papists as ne∣cessary to bee obserued. which they vrge on men, and binde their consciences with the necessary obseruation of them: they teach that the sanctification and keeping of their appointed feasts is necessary, how then can they free themselues from the brand of such teachers as the Apo∣stle deales against in this verse, euen such as binde the con∣science when they ought not, and charge men with sinne vniustly. Oh, saith the Papist (hee hath his cauelling exception ready) the Apostle heere delt against Iewish obseruation of daies and Iudaicall festiuities, and you misaply the text against Christian holy daies, such as ours bee. See the cunning of these men to deceiue themselues, what is this but a meere shift, for howsoeuer, it is true, the Apostle dealt against Iewish feasts, yet the doctrine of this place may be generally applied against Iewish or any other superstitious obseruation of daies whatsoeuer, the Papists in this case doe, as he that strips himselfe of one
sort of cloathing, and for pride doth inuest himselfe with a suit of a newer fashion, euery man knowes he puts not a∣way his pride, but onely changeth his fashion: so the Pa∣pists doe but change from one sute of sinne to another, they keepe not the same feasts that the Iewes did, but they haue new feastes in their steed, and those full of grosse su∣perstition, for they hold the obseruation of them necessa∣rie, yea part of Gods worship, and place greater holinesse in those feasts then in the Lords Sabbath, and dedicate many of them to the honour of Saints and Martyrs, that they may be pertakers of their merits, and helped by their praiers. Now what is this, but most grosse and abomina∣ble Idolatry, and wee must needes in this respect hold them in the number of false teachers. But may some say,  may not we haue solemnities and festiuall daies appointed by our Church, and they beeing appointed, may not we obserue them. Answ:  Our Church may appoint such daies, and be∣ing appointed wee may obserue them, Iohn 10.22. Wee read there was the feast of Dedication at Ierusalem, which was a feast ordained by the Church, in the time of Iudas Machabaeus, as we finde 1. Mach, 4.59. in remembrance of the reparation of the Temple, and deliuerance from the tyrranny of Antiochus, and verse 23. Christ himselfe was present at the feast, and by his presence he hath giuen ma∣nifest allowance of this. that the Church may appoint fe∣stiuall daies, and being appointed, we may obserue them; yet know how the Church may appoint, and how wee may obserue them being appointed, (namely) with these cautions. First,How the Church may appoint and how we may obserue festi∣uall daies. if the appointment and obseruation of them bee held as a thing indifferent, not of absolute necessity. Secondly, if it be voide of superstition, neither placing the worship of God, nor any force of Religion in that ob∣seruation of them, nor with any opinion of holinesse in those times, but that the appointment of them, be for the
assembly of Gods people, for the exercise of the word and praier. Thus may the Church appoint festiuities, and being so appointed wee may obserue them, and thus doth the Church of England obserue holy daies and no otherwise and therefore the Brownists either ignorantly, or malici∣ously doe vs wrong, in demanding whether our feasts bee the true worship of God or no, in their printed questions, for we place no worship of God in them (but that by the way. Wee see how the Church may appoint festiuities, and how we may obserue them and yet this is still a certaine truth that wee now in time of the Gospell are not bound in conscience, and necessarily to the religious obseruation of daies, except onely the Sabbath day, and not to passe from this without some word of exhortation. Is it so, that wee now in time of the Gospell thorow Christ haue this liberty, that we are not tied in conscience  to necessary obseruation of any daies, excepting onely the Sabbath. Then let vs not forgoe this liberty, and now make our selues slaues to certaine daies,Wee are not to make our selues slaues to certaine daies. and that after the manner of the very heathen. How is that, may some say? I answer,  that is done when wee put a difference be∣tweene day and day in regard of good or bad successe; as forsooth this is a dismall day, a day of bad successe, there∣fore we may not put on new garments, take a iourney or begin any worke on that day, thus to obserue daies after an heathenish manner, is vtterly to renounce Christian li∣bertie; yea to professe that we are still in bondage to sinne, Satan, and the corruption of our owne hearts: let this be farre from vs, and let vs remember what the Lord saith vn∣to his people by the mouth of his Prophet Ier. 10.2. Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid for the signs of heauen; feare not the signes of heauen, if we feare them
certainely we feare not God. Therefore let vs take heede of this, let vs hold fast our liberty in respect of daies pur∣chased by Christ, and vse it with good conscience, remem∣ber thou art set free by Christ, from the obseruation of any Iewish feast, therefore keepe thou euery day a Chri∣stian feast. How is that may some say? I will tell thee in a word;  purpose euery day to auoyd all and euery sinne, set thy selfe euery hower of the day in the sight of God, and walke as before him carefully and conscionably in all good duties, and so doing thou shalt keepe a good conscience, and that the wise man hath told vs. Prou. 15.15. is a continuall feast euen euery day holy day: some there be that take occasion from this text of the Apostle, to open their mouthes against the Lords or∣dinary Sabboth, and to say it is heere put among the cere∣monies of the Iewes, and so is abrogated and quite aboli∣shed, and we ought not to keepe it, but if we remember the exposition of the words, they may be answered in a word, that the Apostle heere speakes not of the Lords ordinary Sabbath, but of the first and last day of the great feastes of the Iewes, yet I thinke it not amisse to stand awhile to make known, and to proue the morality of the Lords Sab∣bath, and that we erre not in the beginning we must know that the Sabbath was before the death of Christ, in part ceremoniall (namely) as it was a seuenth day from the creation, and in regard of the strickt rest of that day enioi∣ned to the Iewes, to whom it was not lawfull to kindle a fire, Exod. 35.3. But as it is a day of rest with some, more liberty in regard of things either of present necessity as the quenching of a fire hauing taken hold on an house, or of lawfull conuenience, as preparing of frugall meate and diet, out of the publike exercise, or without hinderance of it;That the Sab∣bath is moral and perpetual, prooued. as it is thus a day of rest set apart for the seruice of God, onely in the exercises of religion, and workes of mer∣cie and loue: so it is morall and perpetuall, I might proue
this by many arguments, consider we only these two. First, the commandement of keeping the Sabbath was giuen to Adam in Paradise before the fall, and therefore doubtlesse it is morall and perpetuall, for he then needed not any ceremony to lead him to Christ, he needed not to beleeue in Christ, hauing not sinned. Againe, it is engrafted in nature that their should bee a time set a part from publike businesses,, and be bestowed on matters concerning Religion. There was no Nation, almost among the Gentiles which had not some festiuall daies for the publike exercise of their Religion, wherein though they erred, yet it sheweth that it was grounded on the Law of nature, that some time should bee appointed for the special worship of God, and consequently it proues the commandement to be morall and perpetuall. Now then is it so, that the Sabbath is morall and per∣petuall:We must not only abstaine from open prophanation of the Sabath, but we must also take hede that wee rest not in a cere∣moniall vse of it. let vs not then onely abstaine from open propha∣nation, by eating, drinking, and immoderate feeding, or whatsoeuer may make vs vnfit for the seruice of God in the duties of Religion. But let vs take heede that wee rest not in the outward and ceremoniall vse of the Sab∣bath, which is a thing too common amongst men: many come to the Church and heare the word, and goe home againe without any profit by it; yea, with much hurt to their soules: they keepe the Sabbath onely for fashion, not with any regard of true godlinesse,Note. neuer labouring by the vse of the Sabbath to grow in loue towards God, or tender affection towards men, for that is the true keeping of the Sabbath. Now then to stirre vs vp to be more carefull hereafter of this dutie, consider onely these two things. First, he or shee that is a wilfull Sabbath breaker, is no true childe of God; for he that is a true childe of God will reason with Saint Iames, 2.10. That hee that hath com∣manded one thing hath commanded another, and breake one commandement of God, and be guilty of all: there∣fore
he feares the breach of euery Commandement of God. Againe, call to minde what the Lord saith in the end of  the fourth commandement that hee hath blessed it and sanctified it, (that is) he hath appointed it for holy vses, that it might be a meanes of blessing both on thy soule, bo∣dy, and whole estate: if then thou wouldest make it good to the comfort of thine owne soule, that thou art a child of God: yea, if thou tender the good of thy selfe, and wouldest bring downe a blessing one thine owne soule, bo∣die, and whole estate, bee carefull to sanctifie the Lords Sabbath, and labour by vse of it to bee brought neerer to God by faith and repentance and neerer to thy brethren in true hearted affection; there is much hatred, grudging, and hart burning amongst men, one against another, what is the cause? Surely amongst other this is one special cause, we are carelesse in the sanctification of the Sabbath, wee keepe it onely for fashion and not as wee ought. Let vs therefore hereafter be more carefull of this duty. VER. 17. Which are but a shadow of things to come: but the body is in Christ. This verse hath respect to the verse immediatly forego∣ing as a further confirmation of it by a new argument, and in it is also couched an answer to a secret exception, that false teachers might take against the Apostles conclusion in the verse before; for happily they might except against him, and say: is not the choice of meats, and obseruation of solemne feasts, new moones, and the vse of other cere∣monies among the Iewes, a thing commanded of God, why then should they be neglected? To this the Apostle doth infold an answer in the words of this verse, and it is this. That they were indeede com∣manded of God, but onely to this ende, to shadow out Christ to come, and at his comming to cease and haue an
end; and so the Apostles argument for confirmation of his conlusion is here taken from the end and vse of the ce∣remonies of the Law, and may thus beframed. The Ceremonies of Moses Law were appointed by God to prefigure and shadow out Christ to come. Therefore Christ being now exhibited and come in the flesh there is no more vse of these ceremonies they haue ended their office in Christ. In this Verse more specially we haue, First, a description of the Legall Ceremonies, what they were in their owne nature and proper vse (namely) that they are a shadow of things to come. Secondly, what Christ is in respect of them, that hee is the body of those shadowes in the words following, but the body is in Christ. Interpreta∣tion.Come we to consider the words of this Verse, (Which) (that is) which ceremonies before mentioned, and all o∣ther of like sort. (A shadow) This word shadow is a word of similitude or comparison and the meaning is a type or resemblance figuring and shewing things to come, and the legall Ceremonies are thus compared to a shadow, es∣pecially in two respects, First, because as a shadow doth shew the body obscure∣ly (for who can perfectly know the body by the shadow?) so the types and figures of the old Law did obscurly shew things to come. Secondly, because as a shaddow is a thing without sub∣stance, and formally by it selfe a meane accident: so the rites and ceremonies of the law taken by themselues, were empty shewes (of good things to come) (that is) of Christ to come, of the misteries and benefits of Christ, as recon∣ciliation with God, iustification, remission of sinnes, pur∣gation of conscience, and the like. (But the body is in Christ) The words are, but the body is of Christ, the meaning is, but Christ is the body of those shadowes (that is) the substance and truth of them, be∣cause
hee did truelie performe and exhibite those thinges which they shadowed▪ thus then brieflie conceiue wee the words of this verse, as if the Apostle had sayd. Which ceremonies before spoken of and all other of like sort, are but an obscure resemblance, and being taken by themselues are but an empty shew of Christ to come, & of the mysteries & benefits of Christ, Christ is the substance & truth of them, he truly performing and exhibiting those things which they did prefigure and shadow out. Now first the Argument heere vsed by the Apostle is to be considered in that he reasons thus. That the end and vse of legall ceremonies was to sha∣dow out Christ to co come. And therefore Christ beeing now come, there is no more vse of them it plainly teacheth vs the abrogation of the vse of all significant and shadow∣ing ceremonies of Mosos Law, that by Christ his comming and death all ceremonies of figure and signification are ab∣rogated and taken away in regard of the vse of them.All significant and shadow∣ing ceremo∣nies of Moses Law are ta∣ken away by Christ his death in re∣gard of the vse of them. I say ceremonies of figure and signification for some were of order, and may be vsed without binding the con∣science to the necessary vse of them. And againe, I say, in regard of the vse of them, for as those ceremonies are set downe in the bookes of the old testament they are part of the written word of God and may still instruct vs concer¦ning Christ his comming suffering death, and the many and great fruits of it: but in regard of the vse and obserua∣tion of them they are quite abrogated and we now in time of the Gospell are free from the obseruation of any Iewish ceremony, being a figure of Christ to come, yea, now the vse and obseruation of Iewish ceremonies is a thing not ar∣bitrary and left to vs as indifferent, but it is vtterly vn∣lawfull, and that is plainely taught Heb. throughout but specially 9.10.11.12. in the 10. verse it is sayd, that the seruice of the old Testament onely stood in meates and drinkes, and diuers washings, and carnall rites vntill the time of reformation, when was that time? it is expressed
in the verse following (namely) the time of Christ his com∣ming but Christ being come, an high Priest of good things to come by a greater & more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands (that is) not of this building. Neither by the bloud of goats and calues: but by his owne bloud entred he in once vnto the holy place, and obtained eternall re∣demption for vs Gal. 5.2. the Apostle was bold to tell the Galahians and he speaks it with authority setting his own name before it, that the vse of circumcision would prooue most dangerous vnto them, behold I Paul say vnto you, that if ye bee circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Act. 16.3. Paul himselfe circumcised Timothy. It is true, but the text sayth it was because of the Iewes, in regard of the weake Iewes, who otherwise would haue beene offended. Why? but if circumcision were vtterly vnlawfull, then hee ought not to haue vsed it for auoyding the offence of any. To this I answer,  though circumcision after the death of Christ was a dead ceremony, yet till the destruction of Solomons temple it was a thing indifferent, it was a ceremo∣ny dead, but not buried, and so was it vsed by the Apostle as a thing indifferent, but after the destruction of the Temple, when the Church of the new testament was planted, then was it a deadly ceremony vtterly vnlawfull. And therefore wickedly,  and most iniuriously deale the Papists, in loading their simple followers with an huge heape of ceremonies,Discouery of the iniurious dealing of the Papists in loa∣ding their fol∣lowers with a masse of cere∣monies. taken partly from the Gentiles, and partly from the Law of Moses, their masse which they ac∣count the marrow of religion, is nothing but a masse of Iewish ceremonies, and therein they lay on mens necks an intollerable yoake so called, Act. 15.10. yea, therein they shew themselues to be led with the spirit of Antichrist, such a spirit as Iohn speakes of, 1. Ioh. 4.3. in effect denying Christ to be come in the flesh, we must remember that we are now set free from the vse of Iewish ceremonies; we now
are not to worship God in outward sacrifices and ceremo∣nies, but in Spirit and trueth, euen in spirituall worship and seruice. The next thing offered vnto vs from this verse is this, that the Apostle in describing the legall ceremonies, vseth this comparison, that they are but shadowes: Hence we are plainely taught thus much. That the significant ceremonies of the Law were onely  obscure resemblances,The signifi∣cant ceremo∣nies of Moses law were only obscure re∣semblances & empty sha∣dowes of Christ and his benefits. and by themselues but empty shadowes of Christ, and the benefites of Christ. Christ was onely shadowed out by them in the time of the old Testament. Christ his grace and benefites were not giuen by the very sacrifices and ceremonies of the Law but they that vsed them were to haue an eye to the bo∣dy of them (namely) Christ, hence it is that the people of God were often reproued by the Prophets in vsing of those sacrifices because they rested in the vse of them, as if by the verie offerings of a sacrifice their sinnes had been taken away, and in their offering they had not an eye to the bodie they looked not at the true perfect sacifice of Christ, whereof those sacrifice were onely a shadowe the Lod therefore sayth, Isai. 1.11.12.13. what haue I to doe with the multitude of your sacrifice, I am full of the burnt offerings of rammes and of the fat of fed beasts, and I desire not the bloud of bullockes, nor of lambes, nor of goats. When you come to appeare before me, who required this of your hands to tread in my courts? Bring no more oblations in vaine: incense is an abhomi∣nation vnto mee: I cannot suffer your new moones nor Sabboths nor solemne daies (it is iniquitie) nor solemne as∣semblies. What is the reason of it? it is giuen ver. 15. in the end for your hands are full of bloud, as if hee had sayd, when you offer these sacrifices, you rest in your outward seruice, as if the very offering of it were suffi∣cient to conferre my grace vppon you, you looke
not by faith to the one true perfect sacrifice, and that is ma∣nifest because you doe not testifie your faith by the fruites of it, you still continue in your sinnes, and so your sacrifi∣ces are abominable in my sight, I cannot endure them, Hebr. 10.1. the holy Ghost sayth in plaine termes, that the Law had the shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things. Heer then comes a question to be handled (namely) this. What difference there is betweene the sacracraments of the old testament and our Sacraments of the new testa∣ment,  for it may seeme that the Sacraments of the old te∣stament being abolished they were but ceremonies, and so but obscure resemblances and by themselues but emptie shewes, and the question may be how our Sacraments dif∣fer from them. The Papists in answer to this question say, that the Sa∣craments of the old testament did only signifie and shadow out grace to bee giuen afterward by the passion of Christ,  but our sacraments in the new testament (say they) doe containe grace in them, and giue grace, ex opere operato by the very worke done; this is a meere vntruth, and a diffe∣rence deuised by themselues, that we therefore may assigne a right difference betweene them, we must first know that that the Sacraments of the old testament, were both cere∣monies and sacraments. Ceremonies as signes of the Mes∣siah to come, and sacraments as seales of the righteousnes by faith hauing the word of promise adioined to them the Lord promising in his word that by those signes he would offer, apply, seale vp and confirme grace in the righ vsers of them. The true an∣swer.Now then for answer to the question, as the Sacraments of the old testament, were ceremonies, so there is a maine difference between them & our sacraments, for so they are onely resemblances of things to come hauing no word of promise annexed vnto them as our sacraments haue, but as they were sacraments, so there is no essentiall differenee be∣tweene
them and our sacraments,No maine difference be∣tweene the sacraments of the old Testa∣ment and our sacraments. they did signifie and seale vp the same grace and righteousnesse to saluation and life eternall, that ours doe, therefore the Apostle calles circumcision the seale of the righteousnesse of the fayth, which Abraham had when he was vncircumcised, Rom. 4.11.1. Corinth. 10.3.4. hee sayth that the fathers in the old testament did eat the spirituall meate, and did drinke the same spirituall drinke, for they dranke of the same spi∣rituall rock, that we do in our Sacraments (namely) Christ and so in substance there is noe difference between their sacraments and ours, yet know that the sacraments of the old Testament and our differs, and that in three things.The sacra∣ments of the old testament ment & ours dissr further in three things First, in outward signes and rites. Secondly the Sacraments of the old testament did fore∣shew Christ to come. Ours are visible declarations of Christ already come. Thirdly, our Sacraments doe more plainely and ful∣ly set Christ and his death before vs then did theirs. For as in the new Testament, the meanes of reuelation is more cleere, the light of faith greater, and the measure of grace more ample, so also by the sacraments of the newe Testament is the grace of Christ more plainely and fully and plentifully offered and dispersed then by the sacra∣ments of the old testament. Now this wee are to consider. Is it so that the grace of Christ, is not nowe set before vs in obscure shadowes,  as it was before his comming in the flesh, is it nowe more fully and plainely and plentifully offered vnto vs in the preaching of the Gospell, and administration of the Sa∣craments; Then let it shame vs to bee behinde them of the old testament, in knowledge, in faith, and in sound and com∣fortable apprehension and application of the grace of Christ.It is a shame for vs to bee behind them that liued in time of the old testament in knowledge, in faith, & in sound recei∣uing of the grace of Christ. Heerin manie are much defectiue, manie haue no vn∣derstanding of the grace of Christ, so plainelie set be∣fore
them in the sacraments, as if Christ were yet in cruci∣fying, and as if his bloud were now dropping from his body in their sight; yet many that come to the Lords ta∣ble, see it not, nor haue any apprehension of the grace that is offered. And what is the cause? Surely, that is one cause which our Sauiour hath giuen Ioh. 3.19. we loue dowes rather then the substance, wee are so wedded to the vanishing pleasures and fading profites of this world, which are but shadowes that wee cannot see, much lesse affect the true substance of grace in Christ. Well, let vs remember what our Sauiour sayth in that place, this is the condemnation that light is come into the world, and men loue darkenesse rather then light, so certainely wee may iustly feare, that this will bee to our deeper condemnation, that the truth and substance of the old shadowes is come into the world, and yet wee rather loue the shadows of pleasure and worldly profits then this enduring substance, therefore our iudgement and con∣demnation shall be the greater. One thing more we may hence gather, in that the A∣postle sayth, that Christ in respect of the legall ceremo∣nies is the trueth and substance of them, wee may con∣clude that all sacrifices propitiatory are nowe ended in Christ,All sacrifices propitiatory are now en∣ded in Christ. they are now needles, yea, they are pernicious, be∣cause Christ his perfect sacrifice is succeeded in stead of all legall sacrifices, they being weake and insufficient to take away sinne, Christ by his one offering hath made perfect them that are sanctified, so saith the Authour to the He∣brewes, Heb. 10.14. and this discouereth to vs, that the  popish sacrifice of the masse, which the Papists hold to be a propitiatory sacrifice for the quicke and dead, is a most abhominable idoll,The sacrifice of the masse is a most abo∣minable idoll. they please themselues in the shadow when they may haue the true substance, for they teach that Christ is still offered vnder the formes of bread and wine, after an vnbloudy manner, which a is most grosse, senceles and dangerous heresie.
Let vs remember that Christ his sacrifice on the crosse,  was the complement,We are to cleaue by faith to the infinite and eternall merit of Christ his sa∣crifice on the crosse. substance and trueth of all the old sacrifices, and so all expiatory sacrifices are ended in that, & let vs by faith only cleaue to the infinit and eternall me∣rit of that one perfect sacrifice, as the onely propitiation for all our sinne, and then we shall be sure to finde remission of sinnes, peace with God in this life, and eternall comfort with him in the life to come. VER. 18. Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you, by humblenesse of minde, and worshipping of An∣gels, aduancing himselfe in those things, which he neuer saw, rashly puft with his fleshly mind. In this verse the Apostle comes to deale against the cor∣ruption of religion and meanes of seducement, and draw∣ing away from the truth fetched from philosophia, and the vaine speculation of certaine Enthusiasts (that is) such as pretended heauenly visions and reuelations, and hee doth insist in one particular, which such false teachers laboured to thrust on the Colossians (namely) the religion or wor∣ship of Angels. Now the Apostles maner of dealing against this is as it was before ver. 16. (namely) by way of dehor∣tation, that the Colossians should not suffer any to corrupt them with the religion or worship of Angels, that is the ge∣nerall matter of this verse.The generell matter of this verse. In the manner of deliuering of it more specially,The manner of deliuering of that matter. two things are offered to our consideration. First a disswasion from suffering false teachers to drawe them away to the worship of Angels. Secondly, a description of such false teaehers. And in both these are couched & contained arguments of refutation to repell that false doctrine of the worship of Angels. The disswasion is in these words (let no man at his plea∣sure
beare ouer you by humblenesse of mind and worshipping of Angels) wherein is laid before vs. First, this generall, Let no man beare rule ouer you, or let no man defraude you: with the manner, how false teachers sought to beare rule ouer the Colossians (namely) after their owne will and pleasure. Secondly, the particular thing whereby false teachers would beare rule ouer them, and defraude them, and that was the worship of Angels; which is amplified by the meanes vsed to perswade thereunto (namely) humblenesse of minde (by humblenesse of minde) for so (as I take it) those two things are to be conceiued and distinguished in the purpose of the Apostle. That the one was the thing whereby false teachers la∣boured to beare rule ouer the Colossians. And the other, the meanes vsed to perswade them vn∣to it. The description of false teachers, what they were, is in the words following. (Aduancing himselfe in those things which hee neuer saw.) First, they are described by their boldnesse, that they durst boldly take on them the knowledge and determi∣nation of things they had neuer seene. (Aduancing himselfe in those things which he neuer saw. Secondly, by the roote and efficient cause of that (name∣ly) the vaine pride of their carnall minds in the last words, rashly puffed vp with fleshly minde. Now the arguments included in this disswasion and description to refell the false doctrine of the worshippe of Angels, are especially these two. First, that such worship is most dangerous, if they should embrace it, it would bee a meanes to drawe them from Christ, to defraude them of their price, and to bring them into thrall and bondage to the corrupt wils of men. Secondly, that such worship is not built on any good
ground, but thrust out from the vaine speculation of men taking on them the knowledge of things they neuer saw, and that through the vaine pride of their owne fleshly mindes. Come we to the words of this verse, and first,Interpreta∣tion. of the disswasion (Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you, by humblenesse of minde, and worshipping of Angels) Wee finde but one word in the originall, heere translated (beare rule ouer you) and for the vnderstanding of it, we must know that the heathens in their games and publike exercises of wrestling, and the like; had some that vsed to sit as vm∣pires to giue to them that did best the rewarde of a garland, a crowne, or some such thing. Now the word heere vsed is Metaphoricall, and it is taken from the cor∣rupt and vniust dealing of such vmpires, who no doubt sometimes defrauded them of the prise, that deserued it. From such vniust dealing of such vmpires is the word heere borrowed, and it signifieth after the manner of vn∣iust vmpires to defraude men of the prise that is due to them: the meaning is to draw them from Christ, and so to defraude them of eternall life and saluation, due vnto them, in, and thorow him (at his pleasure) that is, accor∣ding to his owne lust, without any reason at all (by humblenesse of minde) the meaning of it is not, by true humblenesse of minde, for that is an exellent grace and vertue: but by a counterfet shew of it, vnder a colour of humblenesse of minde (and worshipping of Angels) the words are (religion of angels) and the meaning is, by re∣ligious adoration, or inuocation of Angels, thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of this diswasion. Let no man according to the lust of his owne heart without any ground at all by his false o∣pinions draw you from Christ, and defraude you of the prise of eternall life due to you in him: and that by perswading you vnder a co∣lour of humblenesse of minde to the inuoca∣tion
and worship of Angels. Now first, obserue we heere that the Apostle was not content with his former disswasion, Verse 16. Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the Sabbath daies. But he subioines this to it as needfull also, Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you by hum∣blenesse of minde, and worshipping of Angels. Thereby giuing vs to vnderstand, that false teachers vsed not one kinde of imposture to draw the Colossians from the truth, but on while they vrged circumsion, and the obseruation of the legall Ceremonies to be needfull to saluation: an other while they magnified angels, and vnder a colour of humblenesse of minde, sought to bring in the wor∣ship of Angels. Hence we may easily take vp this conclu∣sion. That Satan hath many faire coloured meanes to cor∣rupt religion,Satan hath many faire coloured meanes to corrupt reli∣gion. if he cannot by one subtilty preuaile to ouerthrow or corrupt the true faith of Christians, he can and will vse another; and if that succeede not a third; yea an infinite number of sleights to that purpose: he is the Dragon with seuen heades, Reuel. 12, 3. (that is) ha∣uing the fulnesse of all subtilty and craft. And this I note, to teach vs to arme our selues not onely against one or two, but against many subtilties of Satan vsed to draw vs away from the truth:We must arme our selues a∣gainst many subtilties vsed by Satan to draw vs from the truth of religion. wee must not onely be armed against the coloured craft and subtil∣tilty of the Papists, labouring to corrupt vs with a shew of Scripture, by addition, detraction or some absurde glosse, misinterpreted by glorious titles of vnity and vniuersality by lying sig es and wonders, and such like, but we must be prouided to withstand the sleight of such as seeme to haue the truth, and yet vnder the colour of a constitution of a Church, goe about to vndermine the whole building of sound faith and religion: yea let vs be circumspect and arme our selues against the subtilty of Satan, vnder the
shew of great knowledge, and profound learning, tendring to vs strong points of doctrine, and dangerous errors, some there be that in this respect are deluded and much decei∣ued, let them remember what they read, Reuel. 2.24. pro∣founditie and depth of learning abused to broach error, is the very deepenes of satan. Let vs therfore arme our selues against it, and against all his subtilties, and that we doe this let vs receiue the truth in loue of the truth, and testifie our loue by bringing foorth the fruits of it, and then no doubt we shall haue the secret of the Lord reuealed vnto vs, as it is said, Psal. 25.14. We shall be able to discerne betweene truth and errour, and spy out the subtiltie of Satan going about to deceiue vs. The next thing we are to obserue in this diswasion is, that the Apostle saith not, Let no man seduce you by bea∣ring rule ouer you by humblenesse of minde, and worship∣ping of Angels, but he sets out such seducement with the danger of it, that it is like to proue a defrauding of them of the prise of eternall life, let no man defraude you of the prise of eternall life and saluation due vnto him, in, and through Christ. Hence are we taught how dangerous a thing it is to bee  seduced and drawne away to any fundamentall error,It is a very dangerous thing to bee drawne away to any funda∣mentall error. The doctrine explaned. such as is the inuocation and worship of Angels: men that are so sedused are in danger thereby to lose eternall life; and that this doctrine be not mistaken, I must of necessitie a little futther explane it. First therefore, I say it is dangerous to be drawne away to such an errour as is against the foundation, and doth o∣uerturne any truth necessary to be beleeued to saluation, as the vnity of the Godhead, the trinity of persons, that Iesus Christ is the onely Sauiour of all Gods chosen, that we are redeemed by him, that we are iustified in the sight of God by faith, without workes, and such like. Secondly, I say not, that such an one as is seduced and drawne away, shall neuer come to life and saluation,
but that he is in danger to lose eternall life, for happily he may be drawne and fall into that errour of weakenesse and ignorance, it was the case of the Galatians, Gal. 1.6. I mar∣uell that ye are so soone remoued away vnto an other Gos∣pell, from him that had called you in the grace of Christ, and he may continue in it ignorantly for a time, and af∣terward repent and be saued. Thus then conceiue we the doctrine, that he that is drawne away to any errour, ouer∣turning the truth necessary to be knowne and beleeued to saluation, is in great danger to lose eternall life, and to be damned foreuer, for he may come to hold that errour obstinately to the end, and then hee shuts himselfe out from all possibilitie of saluation. The Apostle saith, Gal. 5.4. Yee are abolished from Christ, whosoeuer are iustifi∣ed by the Law, yee are fallen from grace. The meaning is, you that are of that erronious opinion, and hold it stifly, that you are iustified by the Law, you are abolished from Christ, Christ is to you an empty and vnprofitable Christ, and then as Saint Iohn saith, 1. Ioh. 5.12. He that hath the Sonne, hath life; and he that hath not the sonne of God, hath not life, he cannot come to be saued. And this may serue to informe our vnderstandings in this point,Information of iudgement touching er∣ronious opi∣nions held by some. that all erronious opinions are not damnable, the Apostles themselues for some time, euen till Christ was ascended into heauen, held an errour touching the e∣stablishment of the Kingdome of Israel by their Lord and master, Act. 1.5. yet were they, euen then, in the state of grace, and saluation, because they rested on Christ, as the onely Sauiour of the world, who should take away theit sinnes, and bring them to euerlasting life; as appeareth, Ioh. 5.68.69. And therefore it is not every erronious opi∣nion that is damnable, but onely such as doth ouerturne some fundamentall truth necessarie to bee held to saluati∣on, and that held with obstinacy to the ende, that shuts a man out from all hope of saluation. Againe, is it so that seducement and drawing away in∣to
some fundamentall errour is so dangerous, is it the ha∣zard  of our owne saluation, then let vs take heede, how we giue place to them that are tempering with vs to yeeld, though neuer so little, to some fundamentall errour,Wee are to beware of such as would haue vs yeelde though but a little, to some fundamentall error. as to hold iustification in the sight of God, partly by faith, and partly by workes. Let vs doe in this case, as the Apostle saith, he did in the like. Gal. 2.5. Giue no place to them by subiection not for an houre, no not for one minute, if we doe, we bring our selues in danger to lose eternall life; it is thought by some, there may be a little yelding to the Papists in fundamental points of religion, and so an vnion and mixture may bee made of their Religion and ours, which is a meere dreame of carnal Gospellers and worldly polititians: we must not yeeld from the least part of truth reuealed necessary to saluation, our yeelding neuer so little from such a truth is most dangerous: the Lord may giue vs vp to goe on, from one degree of error to an other, till we come to hold a lye in the right hand, (that is) with obsti∣nacy continue in it, and so be damned. Let vs therefore take heede of yeelding any iot from a fundamental truth, let vs hold that more precious then the whole world. Marke we further, the Apostle saith, Let no man beare  rule ouer you at his pleasure,Such as are misled by o∣thers, either into errors or sinne, are held by them in a miserable thraldome. Proofe of the first. according to his owne cor∣rupt lust, without any reason at all. See then the fearefull thraldome of such as are seduced by false teachers, they beare rule ouer them at their pleasure, they leade them whither they list. I shewed when I stood on the 8. vers. that false teachers carry away the simple as a prey, and vse them at their pleasure, the Apostle hath made it manifest, 2. Cor. 11.20. where he saith, The Corinthians suffered false tea∣chers to vse them at their pleasure. Hauing handled that point, I will not now stand vpon it, nor now remember the vse was made of it: but consider wee the truth of this in an other kinde: as false teachers leade the simple into error, and hold them in it at their pleasure; euen thus doe ma∣ny wicked instruments of sinne, such as are meanes to
draw others to sinne, and to leade them to lust and lewd∣nesse, to riot and vnthrifty meanes, doe not they leade them at their pleasure and hold them in sinne, as they list. Looke one the example of Ahab, 1 King. 21.25. It is there said,Proofe of the second. he sould himselfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the Lord, and that Iezabel his wife prouoked him, hee was a slaue to sinne at the prouocation of Iezabell his wife. Looke againe, Prou. 7.22. the whorish woman hauing entised the wanton younge man destitute of vnderstan∣ding, it is said, hee followed her straight waies as an oxe that goeth to the slaughter, and as a foole to the stockes for correction. And not to seeke farre for examples, are there not many in the world that are slaues to wicked instruments of sin, euen to such as leade them to drunken∣nesse, filthynesse and many lewde courses, are they not ready to attend them at their becke, and at their call to go whither they list to leade them? yea, are they not ready to goe with them when they will haue them, sometimes (which is able make any honest hart to to bleed) from the Church to the Tauerne, are there not such in the world? it is too euident, there bee too many. Well, my speech tends to this purpose, to let such as are thus led by others to know, and see, in what a miserable thraldome they are, they will say sometimes when they are dealt withall to put vp any iniurie or wrong, they will not be made fooles for any mans pleasure, such an one shall not vse them at his pleasure, and they put it vp and say nothing, and yet they can be content that the Deuill and his instruments should leade them to lewdnesse and sinne at their pleasure; yea to be helde in the snare of the Deuill at his will and plea∣sure.  2. Tim. 2.26. Learne whosoeuer thou art, that art thus led by wic∣ked instruments of Satan to see and consider thy bondage, that thou art in a miserable thraldome, and seeing it, to vse all good meanes to hasten out of it;They that are led by others to sinne must take notice of their bondage and hasten out of it. and for such as are
meanes to draw others to sinne: I say no more but this; That as they are the Deuils factors: so without great re∣pentance they shall one day be his partners, and their por∣tion shal be with him that was the first entier to sin, (that is) the Deuill and his Angels in the bottomlesse pitte of Hell. One thing more is offered to our consideration from the forme of speach heere vsed (Let no man defraud you of your prise) It should haue beene spoken of before, but it will not bee amisse now to remember it; It is this, in that the Apostle saith, Let no man defraude you of your prise, meaning by the word (prise) eternall life and sal∣uation in, and through Christ. Hence it is euident and plaine that eternall life is pro∣posed  and set before vs as a prise,Eternall life is set before vs in the Scrip∣ture as a prise. it is made knowne to vs in the Scripture, to bee as a garland, or a crowne that is wont to be giuen to such as runne well in a race, or such as wrastle well, or the like, 1. Cor. 9.24. They which runne in a race, runne all, yet one receiues the prise: so runne that yee may obtaine, meaning the prise of eternall life, and verse 25. he saith, but we for an incorruptible crowne, (that is) for an incorruptible crowne of life and saluation, Phil. 3.14. saith the Apostle, I follow hard toward the marke, for the prise of the high calling of God in Iesus Christ (that is) to that heauenly glory, to which God cals all his elect in Christ. Now the reason,  why eternall life is thus resembled to a prise, or a Crowne, is not as the Pa∣pists teach, because it is deserued, but because it is giuen as a reward after we are come to the ende of our race af∣ter wee haue runne the race that is set before vs in this life, keeping faith and a good conscience, and haue finished our course in holinesse and the feare of God, then is the crowne of life & glory giuen, and in that respect it is said, to be a prise, or a crowne, as the Apostle shewes plainely, 2. Tim. 4.7.8. I haue fought a good fight, and haue fini∣shed my course, I haue kept the faith: and then in the
eighth verse he subioyns, hencefoorth is layd vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue his appearing, he saith not, ther∣fore I haue deserued the crowne of righteousnesse, but that the Lord the righteous iudge should giue it to him at that day. Oh, but sayth the Papist, it is called a crowne of righte∣ousnesse, it is giuen by a righteous iudge, for these two words they stand on in that verse. Therefore it is iustly de∣serued. I answere  them, it is called a crowne of righteousnesse because it is indeede the reward of true beleeuers, euen of such as are iust and righteous in Christ, bringing forth the fruites of righteousnesse, and it is sayd to bee giuen by a righteous iudge. because it is giuen by God who is iust in performing his promise, for hee hath freely promi∣sed to all such as are in Christ, and bring foorth good fruites of holinesse and righteousnesse, the reward of eter∣nall life, and in performing this promise of his, he is heere sayd to bee iust, and so the meaning of the Apostle in the generall sentence comprehended in the words of that verse is this. That the Lord doth crowne true beleeuers, bringing foorth the fruites of holinesse and righteousnesse with the rewarde of eternall life, and that iustly, or as a iust iudge, not in regard of the merite of those workes, but in respect of his owne free promise in Christ, hauing bound himselfe by his his promise to giue them the re∣warde of eternall life, hee is iust in performance of the  same. In doing good duties we may law∣ully respect the promised reward.We see▪ it then made cleere, that eternall life is proposed and set befor vs as a prize. And this being so, hence it followeth that wee may law∣fully haue respect vnto it in dooing good, it is warrant∣able by the worde of God to haue an eye vpon the pro∣mised
reward in performance of good duties, for if it bee lawfull to abstaine from sinne for feare of eternall punish∣ment in hell, (as it is) we are so taught, Matth. 10.28. then it is also lawfull to doe good, with respect of eternall re∣ward, the Papists they charge vs to teach that men may not doe good with respect to any reward;A Popish slaunder. but they slander vs it is our constant doctrine, that wee may yet, vnderstand wee this doctrine aright, wee may in doing good haue re∣spect vnto the recompence of reward, so as wee doe it not onely or principally in that respect, in doing good wee are chiefely to minde and respect Gods glory,How in do∣ing good wee may haue re∣spect to the re¦compence of reward. and the dis∣charge of our duty, and in the second place we may looke for the promised reward. To minde the recompence of reward only or principal∣ly is the property of a mercenary hireling, and proceedes from selfe loue, in the duties of religion or loue to all men. We are to looke first and principally after Gods glory, and the discharge of a good conscience in doing our duty, and then we may lawfully haue an inferiour and secondary respect to the recom∣pence of reward. Againe, is eternall life proprosed and set before vs as  a prize or as a crowne to bee giuen,We are euer to haue our eyes fixed vp∣on the crown of glory in doing good duties. after wee are come to the end of our race, then our duty is euer to haue our eye vppon it, wee are euer to fixe our eyes, I meane, the eyes of our mindes vpon that crowne of glory and blisse that is prepared for all them that loue the appearance of Christ: & this is a duty of excellent vse, it wil make vs run with patience and comfort the race, that is set before vs and make vs hold out and perseuere in the feare of God amidst the trobles & miseries of this life: yea, in the midst of ma∣ny violent assaults & temptations of Satan. It is sayd, Heb. 11.26. That Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Aegypt: & what was the reason?
because (sayth the text) he had respect to the recompence of reward, and Heb. 12.2. it is sayd, that Christ himselfe endured the crosse, and despised the shame, and is set at the right hand of the throne of God, and why? for the ioy that was set before him, so certainely, such as are the members of Christ, looking vp to the ioy & glory that af∣ter a while they shall enioy, it will make them endure with patience any crosse, and despise and set light by any shame that the world can throw vpon them, though the mouths of wicked men bee opened wide against them, and loade them with many opprobrious speeches, yet will not they be mooued, but esteeme them as the speeches of idle lookers on, and giue them leaue to speake and still hold on their holy course with a right foot in the race towards heauen, let vs therefore euer remember to lift vp the eyes of our mindes, and fasten them on that glory that heereafter shall bee reuealed, this duty was neuer more needefull to bee often vrged, then now in these daies wherein the greatest part haue their minds groueling and poring on the things of this world, & haue no view, no not so much as a glimps of that eternall waight of glory that shall be reuealed, yea, euen such as professe religion and the feare of God, begin to cast their eyes aside, and to look with too much delight on the things of this world; and to minde earthly things too much; well, let such as with Demas embrace this pre∣sent world, and are euer poring on the things of it, know, that it is a thousand to one, that the sight of eternall glory shall then faile them, when they haue most neede of com∣fort by it, euen in the day of death, and in the houre of temptation, they may then happily seeke for the sight of it, and not finde it, but insteede of it, haue the sight of the torments of hell to bee readie for to cease vppon them. Let such also that feare God and beginne to looke aside on the things of this worlde, know it will bee harde euen for them to holde out in saith, and in the feare of God
in time of triall, remember the example of Dauid, hee was a man that had spent much time in trauelling towards Heauen, yet looking but a little aside vppon the glitte∣ring shew of this world, had very neere lost his way, his feete were almost gone; his steppes had well neere slipt, Psal. 37.2. Let vs therefore be stirred vp euer to keepe our eies fixed on the marke, and to looke to the prise of eternall life that we may be able to runne the race that is set before vs with patience and comfort, and hold out in faith, & in the feare of God in the greatest triall and temptation; yea, in the very point of death, we know not how soon the Lord may bring vs into the triall. The next thing wee are led to consider by the order of this disswasion, is the meanes that false teachers vsed to perswade to the worship of Angels, which was the coun∣terfet shew and colour of humility for so wee expounded those words (by humblenesse of minde) which may be fur∣ther explained thus. That false teachers vsed both an hypocriticall shew of humility in themselues, in their speeches and behauiour, and vfed also a coloured argument taken from humility to perswade to the worship of Angels. I will onely note one thing, from hence wee shall haue more fit occasion to speak of counterfet humility verse 23. Hence then obserue we, that it is an ancient practise of  Satan, vnder the colour of vertue to draw men to sinne;It is an old practise of Satan vnder colour of ver∣tue to draw men to sinne. he laboured to draw the Colossians to the worship of An∣gels vnder a shew of humility, by arguing and reasoning from humility,; no doubt after this or the like manner; the Maiesty of God is most holy and most glorious, and ther∣fore we being dust and ashes, sinnefull creatures, ought not to approach vnto him, or craue any thing at his hands im∣mediately without the intercession of some that are more pure and neerer to God, and may preuaile more with him then we our selues, and such be the Angels, therefore
make them your spokesmen, and intercessours to God for you, thus in all liky-hood they laboured to perswade the Colossians to the worship of Angels. Thus doe the Papists at this day, oh say they, it is boldnesse and presumption in you to goe to God in prayer, bee humble, goe to God by meanes of Saints and Angels, I note this in a word to this purpose. To let vs see that it is not alwaies lawfull that comes to vs vnder the colour of good,It is not al∣wayes lawfull that is tende∣red vnto vs vnder the co∣lour of good. but sometimes it is wicked & sinnefull, for example, to consult with a witch, a sorcerer or charmer, is a thing tendered by the Diuell vnder the co∣lour of much good and no harme at all in it; as forsooth, it is good to haue things that are lost againe, and to bee cured of a disease, and it is done by good words and good praiers and the like. Thus doth the Diuell delude many in the world and thrust on them, that which is wicked and sinfull, vnder a semblance and shew of great good. Ob.But are not the wordes of Scripture good will some say? Yes they are, but being peruerted and vsed to that end, the Lord neuer appointed, they beeome euill, yea, the Di∣uels words to them that so vse them. What better wordes can there bee, then such as expresse the praise of God, yet such words may be wicked, beeing abused, 1. Sam. 23.2. it was Sauls sin, when the Ziphims to curry fauour with him, came to betray Dauid to him, and to discouer where hee was that Saul might take him; he breakes out into praise and thankesgiuiuing to God, for that their wickednesse, and sayth, be ye blessed, or blessed be God for you, a most wicked thing was it in Saul thus to praise God, yet were his words good. Let not then the Diuell delude vs, and vnder the colour of good draw vs to euill, though the words be good, yea, the words of the Sctipture, and though the prayer bee the Lords prayer, yet being vsed to effect that for which there
is no reason, either in nature or in the word of God, rhey become euill, and though the Lord doe suffer things to be done by such meanes, yet let vs know it is in iudgement o a greater plague, men thereby come to prosper in sinne, and their hearts are made more hard and incureable. Come we to the thing that false teachers laboured to thrust on the Colossians, which was the worship of An∣gels. Hence we are taught, that the worship of Angels is vt∣terly  vnlawfull;The worship of Angels is vtterly vnlaw∣full. and that wee mistake not the poynt, wee must know that there is a reuerence due to the good An∣gels (namely) a reuerence of loue, not of seruice, religious worship and seruice is onely due to God,The doctrine explained. not to any crea∣ture, Saint or Angell, therefore the Angell forbids Iohn to worship him, and bids him worship God, Reuel. 19.10. the Papists they giue diuine honour and adoration to the An∣gels, yea,  they hold it lawfull to direct their praiers vnto them,It is a wicked superstition to make Angels intecessors be∣tweene God and vs as the Papists doe. & to make them intercessors between God & them which is a wicked superstition heer condemned by the A∣postle, we are to renounce it, and to hold vs onely to the mediation & intercessiō of Iesus Christ, & in him alone of∣fer vp our praiers to God, & not in the name of any other. And to strengthen vs in this truth, that in the mediation of Christ alone, we are to offer vp our prayers to God, con∣sider briefly these reasons. Reasons pro∣uing the me∣diation of Christ alone. First, we read 1. Tim. 2.5. that Christ is the onely Me∣diatour betweene God and man, and therefore in his name onely are we to pray vnto God. The Papists say, Christ indeede is the onely Mediatour of redemption, but Angels an Saints are Mediators of in∣tercession, which distinction is flat against the plaine eui∣dence of the Scriptures. We are taught, Heb. 7.24. that Chrlst hrs Priesthood is euerlasting, and one part of honor belonging to his Priest∣hood is to make intercession as followeth, ver. 25. & Ro. 8. the Apostle sayth in plaine wordes, that Christ sitteth at
the right hand of God, to make request for vs, there∣fore this distinction cannot stand with the truth of Gods word. Secondly he onely must bee our mediator betweene God and vs, who is able not onely to remoue sinne, death, and damnation, but to procure righteousnesse, life, and the fauour of God, for we are taught to come to God, not as to a Iudge, but as to a Father, and to say our Father, &c. But Christ onely doth this,, he onlie doth reconcile vs to God, and procure vnto vs righteousnesse, life, and the fa∣uour of God, in him onely wee come to bee the adopted sonnes and daughters of God, all the Angels in heauen are not able to procure that God should bee a father vnto vs. Therefore in Christ his name onlie are wee to pray vnto God. Lastly, wee are commanded to pray vnto God in the name of Christ, and we haue promise to be heard, praying onely in his name; therefore in his name alone are wee to pray vnto God. Other reasons might bee added, but these, I hope, may suffice to confirme vs in this truth. I will brieflie an∣swere a doubt that happily may arise in the mindes of some. It may seeme, that not onely Christ but the holy Ghost also is an intercessor betweene God and vs, Rom. 8.26.27 the Apostle saith, The Spirit it selfe maketh request for the Saints, according to the will of God. To this I answer,  that the meaning of the Apostle is, that the spirit of God doth breath into our hearts such mo∣tions whereby we call on God earnestly, euen with sighes and grones which cannot be expressed, for wee must not think that the spirit doth sigh but doth inspire into vs such motions whereby wee call on GOD with sighes and groanes. Againe, we are to marke, verse the 27. it is said that the spirit makes request for the Saints according to the will of
God, the meaning is, he teacheth men to pray, according to Gods will; hee teacheth both what, and how to pray, and so this doubt is cleared. Come we to the description of false teachers, what they were. And first, they are described by their boldnesse, that  they durst boldly take on them the knowledge of things which they had neuer seene expressed in these words, Ad∣uancing himselfe in those things which he neuer saw. Secondly, by the roote of that (namely) the vaine pride  of their carnall mindes, in the last words (rashly puft vp with his fleshly minde.) For the first of these, I will first cleare the words; the word translated (aduancing) doth properly signifie boldly,Interpre∣tation. setting his foot vpon an other mans possession, without al right and title, thrusting himselfe into the possession of that belongs not vnto him, the meaning is after the man∣ner of an intruder thrusting himselfe into the knowledge, or taking on him the knowledge and determination (in those things which hee neuer saw) (that is) those things he neuer saw with the eie of his body, nor yet by the eie of faith, for faith is of things not seene by the eie of the body Heb. 11.1. our Sauiour saith to Thomas, Ioh. 20.29. Bles∣sed are they that haue not seene, and haue beleeued, yet is faith of things reuealed and made knowne in the written word of God, and so the Apostles meaning, in saying (in those things which hee neuer saw) is, in those things hee neuer saw, either by the eie of his body, or by the eie of faith. Thus then we are to conceiue these words, as if the A∣postle had said. As an intruder boldly thrusting himselfe into the know∣ledge, and taking on him the knowledge of things hee ne∣uer saw, either by the eie of his bodie, or by the eie of faith, made known in the written word of God, euen of things whereof he hath no testimonie, either from experience, or
from Scripture, but are such as are either deuised by him∣selfe, or had by some phantasticall reuelation. I might heere stand to shew, that the worship of An∣gels is a thing meerely deuised, and a thing inuented and thrust out from the vaine wit of some men who tooke on them to know things concerning the Angels, for which they had no warrant, either from experience, or from the the word of God, but I hold it not needfull to stand on that point, I will rather speake of the generall conclusion offered from this part of the description of false teachers, that they were such as did aduance themselues in things they neuer saw. Hence wee are giuen to vnderstand thus much that it is the property of a false teacher to take on him the knowledge of things, not seene, nor reuealed vnto him,It it the pro∣perty of a false teacher, or take vpon him the know∣ledge of things not reuealed vnto him. a false teacher, will not sticke boldly and confidently to auerre things he neuer saw, nor learned out of the written word of God, he is such an one as the Lord speakes of, E∣zek. 13.3. That followeth his owne spirit, and hath seene nothing (that is) hath had nothing reuealed to him from the Lord. The boldnes of the papists.It were easie to giue instance in many examples of old; but not to stand long on this, the teachers among the Pa∣pists at this day, doe sufficientlie cleare this to be a trueth, they dare take on them the knowledge of many things not reuealed: as of the order of the heauenly Angels, they dare boldly tell you there is an hierarchy of the An∣gels in heauen, and there be such and such orders of them, they dare take on them to know and determine what se∣uerall roomes, what distinct places there be in Hell, as that there is besides the place of the damned, Limbus pa∣trum, and Limbus infantum, and Purgatory, and I know not what. And these, and the like, they auouch with great boldnesse, as if they had seene them with their eies; and yet are they neuer able to proue them by any eie witnesse, or by any testimony of Scripture.
See then and consider, how farre men goe, when it  pleaseth God to giue them vp to error,Men goe farre in error when Gods giues them vp vn∣to it. they runne to a fearefull height, euen to auouch with boldnes, that which they cannot warrant, either from their owne experience, or from the written word of God. And by this also take knowledge of it, that not onely  they are led with a spirit of error, who rest on idle visions and dreames, as doe the giddie headed Monkes among the Papists, and also, the swelling Enthusiastes such as pre∣tend priuate illumination of the spirit,They are led with a spirit of error, who rest in idle visions and dreames or priuate illu∣mination of the Spirit. such as take on them the knowledge of some things without the word, by priuate illumination, they also are carried with a spirit of error, and we are to auoid them as deceiuers. Isay 8.20. to the law and to the testimony, saith the Lord, and if men speake not according to this word, it is because their is no light in them. Let men therefore pretend, what light, what knowledge, or illumination they will, yet if it bee not ac∣cording to the written word of God, it is no true light and illumination, but a diuelish Satanicall illusion, and if any such be tempering with vs, we are to auoide them as de∣ceiuers. In the next place, in that the Apostle doth thus describe a false teacher, and taxe him to be one that doth aduance himselfe, and take on him the knowledge of things he ne∣uer saw. Wee may easilie gather, that it is a fault to thrust our  selues into the knowledge of things not reuealed,It is a fault to thrust our selues into the knowledge of things not reuealed. and cu∣riosity is to be auoided, which is a bolde seeking, and loo∣king into things not reuealed, either in the word, or by a∣ny euent, that is, to presume to vnderstand aboue that which is meete, contrary to the rule of the Apostle, Rom. 12.3. Let no man presume to vnderstand aboue that which is meet to vnderstand, but let him vnderstand ac∣cording to sobriety. Yea, that is to take on vs to rush on in∣to Gods closet, and to set foote as it were into his Seuerall, euen to thrust our selues into the knowledge of his secret
will, which he hath hedged in, and kept seuerall to himself and will not haue vs thrust our selues into the searching of it, Deut. 29.29. The secret things belong to the Lord our God, they are his peculiar; but the things reuealed be∣long to vs, and to our children for euer. It was the fault of the Apostles, Act. 1.6. When they would needes know, whether hee would at that time restore the kingdome to Israel? They receiued answer with a checke, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his owne power. When Peter asked, Lord what shall this man doe, Ioh. 21.21. he was answered with a short reproofe, verse 22. If I will that he tarrie till I come, what is that to thee, meddle not thou with that. Let vs then take knowledge of it, that it is a fault to bee curious in searching that which God hath neuer reuealed;Reproofe of such as curi∣ously search into things not reuealed & thrust them∣selues into things bree∣ding questiōs rather then godly edify∣ing. as to question what God did before hee made the world, where Hell is, and what parts are in hell, and the like: yea it is a fault to thrust our selues into such things as breede questions, rather then godly edifying, the Apostle con∣demnes it, 1. Tim. 14. Giue not heede to fables and gene∣alogies which are endlesse, and breed questions, rather then godly edifying which is by faith. We are to auoid cu∣rious medling, euen with such things as may breed idle and vnprofitable questions: a thing too common in these daies, many men to make shew of their knowledge, take delight to rush into such matters as may breed questions, and such questions as tend not to build in loue out of a pure heart which is lawfull and commendable; but to vaine iangling, as the Apostle speakes, euen to quarrel and contention about names and titles, and things of no mo∣ment, and so the Lord many times in his iust iudgement giues vp such persons to the vanitie of their mindes and suffers them to ioine hands with Brownists, Familists, or some other schisme, and in the ende, they come to this that it may be truely said of them which the Apostle said of some in his time, 1. Tim. 1.7. They would be Doctors
of the Law, and yet vnderstand not what they speake, nei∣ther whereof they affirme they would make the world beleeue they know more then other men, and see further into matters then others, and yet vnderstand not what they speake, and whereof they affirme: well let vs labour by all good meanes to know matters of faith and good conscience. (I speake not against diligent searchers into the word of God,) but let vs auoide all matter of curious and needlesse questions, and if we will needes bee quicke sighted & searching: let vs be so in regard of our own sins and corruptions to find them out,Wherein we are to bee quicke sighted and searche for who can vnderstand his faults, Psalm. 19.12. and let vs bee so in regard of the sleights of our spirituall enemies, that we may find out the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the Diuell: heere is indeed matter of search and enquiry, and heerein we shall find matter enough to busie our heads, to exercise our wits and so spend the best reach of our vnderstandings vpon. Before I leaue this point, I thinke it needefull to re∣mooue an imputation that is throwne vpon vs by the Pa∣pists,An imputati∣on throwne vpon vs by the Papists, remooued. they bend the force of this doctrine against vs on this manner, say they, you may be iustly charged to bee such, as thrust your selues into the knowledge of things not reuealed. Why so? because, say they, you take on you infallibly to know that you are in the num∣ber of Gods chosen, and such as shall be saued:  this (say they) is presumption this is to aduance your selues in things you neuer saw, yea this is to steppe vp into heauen, and to make your selues of Gods priuy Councell, because you haue no speciall word nor reuelation for it, as Paul and some speciall men had, and therefore Paul might say, Rom. 8.38. I am perswaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come: vers. 39. nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall bee able to separate vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord. Answ:  Though the word doe not say to me, or thee,
by name, beleeue thou Iohn, or thou Peter, and thou shalt be saued, yet it saith, whosoeuer beleeueth in the Son of God shall not perish, but haue euerlasting life, Iohn 3.16. Now, who is so simple that knowes not the generall doth comprehend the speciall, especially where there is a word of command to apply, and the minister standing in the roome of Christ as his ambassadour, 2. Cor. 5.20. to assure as many as beleeue, that they shall be saued. Obiect:  But the Minister may mistake the matter. Answ:  True, if he speake absolutely, but if hee speake vpon condition of faith and true repentance he may ther∣upon assure a man of saluation: he may say, beleeue thou and repent truely, and thou shalt be saued. If a King should publish and make knowne, that whosoeuer of such a Citie shall come and doe such a thing, shall bee thus or thus re∣warded, and giue charge to some to make it knowne to that City, shall wee say that any hauing autho∣rity to publish the Kings pleasure, doth mistake the matter in so doing, or that any of that place, to whom it should bee said, goe thou and doe that which the King hath ap∣ointed, and he thereupon going, and doing the thing ap∣pointed, doth presume to take on him to know more then he ought touching the Kings pleasure? Surely no. Now so is it in the same case, & therfore it is but a cauelling slander of the Papists, to say, that we are too curious to go beyond things reuealed, in that we take on vs to come to infallible knowledge of our own saluation: and to come again home to our selues, let not any of vs take occasion vpon the do∣ctrine now deliuered, to say, it is curiositie to search, whe∣ther I am in the number of Gods chosen or no; and there∣fore, say I will referre all to God, and let him worke his will, as some ignorant, or carnall Gospellers vse to say; No, no, we may, and we ought to search into it, whether we be in the state of grace and saluation or no,We may, and ought, to search, whe- we be in the state of grace, or no. it is no pre∣sumption, we haue the Apostles warrant for it, 2. Cor. 13.5. Prooue your selues whether you are in the faith, exa∣mine
your selues, know ye not your owne selues that Ie∣sus Christ is in you except yee bee reprobates. Therefore wee may and we ought to search whether wee bee in the number of Gods chosen or no, yet by direct meanes we are not to pry into Gods closet, or to step vp into heauen and search the roules of heauen, whether our names bee there written or no, but looke thou into the closet of thine own heart, and see if there thou finde assurance of faith in the testimony of Gods spirit, bearing witnesse with thy spirit that thou art the childe of God, and the fruits of his grace, and finding these things thou mayest, yea, thou oughtest to bee fully perswaded of it, that thou art in the number of Gods chosen, & let vs not be driuen from this duty, it is the duty of euery one thus to search whether hee bee in the state of grace and saluation or no, that finding him∣selfe in that state hee may reioyce with ioy vnspeakea∣ble and glorious, or finding himselfe not in that state hee may vse all good meanes with speede to come vn∣to it. Come we to the words following, wherein is set foorth the roote of that boldnes that was in false teachers (name∣ly) the vaine pride of their carnall mindes (rashly puft vp with his fleshly minde) where note wee one thing in ge∣nerall. Hence it is cleere, that the vaine pride and windy con∣ceit  of a carnall minde is the mother of boldnesse and pre∣sumption,Boldnesse and presumption comes from the vain pride & windy con∣ceit of a car∣nall minde. it is that which makes men take on them the knowledg of things not reuealed, yea, it is that which doth thrust men into many bold actions, what a bold part was it in Pharaoh and his hoast to follow after the Israelites into the sea? whence came it? the text is plaine, it came from a proud conceit, that they could doe what they list them∣selues Exod. 15.9. sayth Moses, The enemy sayd I will pursue, I will ouertake them, I will deuide the spoyle, my lust shall bee satisfied vpon them, I will drawe my sword, mine hand shall destroy them. Thus boasted rayling
Rabshaketh with many insolent wordes, 2. King. 18.27. and wee neede not seeke farre, for examples to this pur∣pose wee may haue them amongest our selues, what is it (I beseech you) that makes such as liue ignorantly and wickedly, presume they shall die blessedly, and obtaine life and saluation? is it any other thing then a selfe con∣ceipt and vaine imagination of a strong faith? and what∣soeuer Preachers say to the contrary, that they are in a damnable case, yet they through an empty conceipt of their owne, trust that God will bee more mercifull then so, hope to bee saued as well as the best, for so commonly they speake, they dare bee bold to equall themselues to the best; what is it that makes men many times thrust themselues into reasoning of other mens liues and acti∣ons vnknowen? is it not a proud conceit of themselues, that they are not as other men? yea, wee shall finde if wee doe obserue it, that in relating other mens knowen sinnes, and vppon iust occasion there will be sometimes a secret lifting vppe of our selues aboue them that are so faulty,Note. wee are to take heede of it, and for vse of the poynt. Let vs know that if we would be free from presumption in any kinde it must bee by casting out pride and all selfe conceipt so long as wee keepe that within vs it will make vs presume euen vpon that for which wee haue no warrant in the worde of God,The way to free our selues of presumpti∣on is to cast out pride and selfe-conceit. as that a blessed death shall close vp a cursed life, let vs therefore empty our selues of all pride and high conceipt of our selues, and to this end la∣bour to see thine owne corruption and misery, the more thou seest that,Note. the more thou shalt be humbled, thus it was with Paul Rom. 7. none are more proud & presumptuous then such as see not their owne wretchednesse, labour thou to see the cursed corruption of thine owne heart, and thy state by nature, that thou art a child of wrath & perdition, yea, if thou beest in the state of grace, yet consider thou standest by grace, and hast many infirmities, and thou shalt
finde it will be a notable meanes to cure pride, and to cast out all high conceit of thy selfe and so keep thee from bold¦nesse and presumption. Now let vs proceede to a more speciall consideration of this part of the description of false teachers, that they were such as were (rashly puft vp with their fleshly minde) the word heere rendered (rashly) may be translated vainely,Interpreta∣tion. for so it doth properly signifie now that may bee vnderstood two wayes either vainely without cause or matter at all, or vainely without fruite or profite, so the word is vsed; Galat. 3.4. haue yee suffered so many things in vaine. (that is) without fruite or profite, but heere wee are to vnderstand the word in the first sence, vainely (that is) without any cause, or matter at all, for which they should be proud▪ (puft vp) this is a metaphoricall and borrowed speech, taken from a bagge or bladder blowen vppe with winde, to set out the nature of pride, which is to lift uppe the heart, and to make it swell like a bladder full of wind, and so the meaning is vainely proud (with his fleshly mind) the wordes are with the minde of his flesh, the meaning is with his carnall, corrupt and vnregenerate minde, thus then conceiue wee these wordes as if the Apostle had sayd. Vainely, without cause or matter for which hee should bee so swelling and proud through the corruption of his carnall minde. Now first in that the Apostle saith, rashly or vainly with∣out cause or matter proud we are plainely taught. That there is sometimes a pride without any matter or  cause to be proud of;Men are som∣times proud of nothing, & their swelling imaginations goe hand in hand with emptinesse. there is sometimes a pride vppon a meere imagination and conceipt of something, when there is nothing; a poore pride as I may call it) a proud heart in a poore breast, when vppon a vaine conceipt men are proud of that they haue not; thus it was with the Church of Laodicea, Reuel. 3.17, Thou sayst I am rich and encreased with goods, and haue need of nothing,
and knowest not that thou art wretched, & miserable, and poore, and blinde, and naked. Yea, pride and swelling imaginations commonly goe hand in hand with emptines,  & the reasons of it are these. First, because they in whom are swelling imaginations feele no want, and therefore cannot pray for a supply of their wants. Secondly, because such are not capable of grace, for God giues grace to the humble but the proud and rich, such as in their owne conceit are full, hee sends away emptie. Not to enlarge the poynt, but to make vse of it, is not this kinde of pride found amongst our selues are there not some who are proud of that they haue not in respect of grace, and of spirituall things;Reproofe of such as are proud of grace and spi∣rituall things which are not in them. for example many there bee who are lift vp with a conceit of faith they haue this opini∣on of themselues, that they beleeue in Christ, and take themselues to be in very good case, and yet indeede come to the triall, and we shall finde they haue not in them any dram of true faith; haue they hearts enflamed with a loue to Gods glory? haue they a feruent desire, that the name & glorious Gospel of Christ, may be magnified? haue they an earnest care of the good of their brethren? doth that care breake out and shew it selfe in actions tending to that pur∣pose? for these be infallible marks of true & liuely faith; no, no, these things are wanting & yet they swell with a conceit of true faith: yea, some there be who hauing some measure of knowledge and grace and looking on that through a false spectacle of selfe loue do ouerween it, and are concei∣ted & proud of that measure that is not in them, & so are vainely puft vp, and euen they also are proud without any matter of pride at all.  Why then will some say, is it lawfull to be proud of somthing when we haue some matter to be proud of, as whē we haue a measure of knowledg & grace? I answer no,  thogh doubtles th'other kind of pride be more hatefull, a poor man proud is most odious, yet is pride for somthing, hateful & abominable, for what hast thou fayth the
Apostle that thou hast not receiued? 1. Cor. 4.7. and that we may yet further see the vglinesse of this sinne, and so be brought to an vtter dislike and detestation of it,The vglinesse of pride dis∣couered. consider we both the causes of it and the fruits of it, without questi∣on, the father of it is the Diuell, and the mother of it is ig∣norance, therefore the Apostle sayth, Rom. 11.25. I would not bretheren, that ye should be ignorant of this secret; yea the mother of it is not ignorance natural or a meer absence of knowledge, but affected and wilfull ignorance, for if we did not wilfully shut our eyes hauing any grace giuen vs, we could not chuse but see that grace to be a free gift, and that we of our selues are to euery good thing not onely in∣sufficient, but euen reprobate and repugnant, and that the gift we haue is imperfect, that we know but in part, & are sanctified but in part; and touching the fruites of pride, they are most bitter & vnsauory, it makes men abuse their good gifts giuen to profite others, euen to the scorne and contempt of others, it is as a dead flie in the boxe of the sweet oyntment of grace, Eccles. 10.1. a proud person will neuer bend downe to be seruiceable to any, hee admits no familiarity with any, pride separates men from their bre∣thren, 1. Cor. 4.7. & that which is worst of all, proud swel∣ling for any gift makes odious in the sight of God, not on∣ly as other sinnes doe, but after a speciall manner, because it returns not that glory to God that is due to him, the proud person takes the glory due to God to himselfe, and so stirs vp the▪ Lord who is iealous of his glory to wrath against him, and therefore was it truly said, Pro. 16.18. pride goes before destruction, and an high minde before the fall, it is an immediate fore-runner of destruction. Seeing then the father of pride is the Diuell, the mother of it wilfull and affected ignorance, the fruits of it is abuse of good gifts, and a prouoking of the Lord to wrath, and that after a speciall manner to our downefall and destru∣ction, Let vs take heede wee bee not put off, either with a conceit of that is not in vs, that wee haue faith when wee
haue none, or for any gift of grace bestowed vpon vs, euer remembring the words of the Apostle, what hast thou that thou hast not receiued. Marke we further, that the Apostle is not content to say that the false teachers hee speakes of were rashly puft vp, but hee addes that their pride and swelling was through the corruption of their carnall mindes (rashly puft vp with his fleshly minde.) Hence we may take vp this conclusion, that it is the cor∣ruption of minde that makes proud, pride comes from within, euen from the corruption of the heart and minde,Pride comes from the cor∣ruption of the heart & mind. Habak. 2.4. the Lord sayth in plaine termes, he that lifteth vp himselfe, or he that is puft vp, his minde is not right in him, his pride comes from the corruption of his minde; Dauid cleering himselfe of pride and of ambition, and pro∣testing his humility before the Lord, Psal. 131.1. sayth, first of all, Lord mine heart is not haughty, and then, nei∣ther are mine eyes lofty; neither haue I walked in great matters, and hid from mee, giuing to vnderstand that the cause of pride is haughtinesse of heart, from the haughty heart come proud lookes and lofty eyes; the reason of this is plaine (namely) this it is,  not riches, honor, or any other good thing, either inward or outward that is in it selfe the cause of pride, it may bee an accidentall occasion, but no true proper cause of it. The cause is an ouerweening con∣ceit of the woorth and excellency of some inward or out∣ward gift, and therefore pride euer comes from within, e∣uen from the corruption of the heart. This then (for the vse of it) must teach vs not to suffer our hearts to settle and seate themselues on the good things we haue either of body or minde, as sufficient and highly deseruing in themselues, we are not to rest on them as a sufficient stay and strength, but remember whence they haue power to effect our purpose, and to doe vs good,We must not suffer our harts to settle on the good things we en∣ioy as suffici∣ent in them∣selues to do vs good. euen from the hand that gaue them? to make golde our hope, as Iob speakes, Iob. 31.24. or to rest on any good
thing as sufficient in it selfe to doe vs good, is the very roote of pride, when Nabuchadnezzar walking vpon the top of his pallace, let his heart please it selfe in the conside∣ration of his greatnesse and dominion, then hee brake out into that proud speech, Dan. 4.27. is not this great Babel, that I haue built for the house of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Maiestie? Yea. we shall find that the deere seruants of God haue been thus ouertaken, when they haue suffered their hearts to dwell vpon the good things they enioied, when Dauid had ouercome his enemies, and was settled in his throne, then looking with too much delight on his own strength, he be∣gan to vaunt himselfe of the multitude of his people, and must needes haue them numbred, 2. Sam. 23.2. let it ther∣fore worke on all theit harts, whom the Lord hath preferd aboue others in respect of any condition or ability, such as haue any gift of God either inward or outward, be it riches or whatsoeuer it is, suffer not thine heart to dwell vpon it, for certainely if thou doe, it will make thee proud, and to this purpose consider we these two things. First,Two reasons against suffe∣ring our harts to settle on the good things we en∣ioy. consider the weakenesse and wants euen of the best gifts themselues, how vnable they are they are to ac∣complish our desires vnlesse a stronger power, euen the hand of God giue strength vnto them. For that which is sayd of bread, that man liues not by bread onely, & that it is not food receiued that doth nourish vs, but the bles¦sing of God vpon it, may be truly said of all other gifts. Againe, consider that in the matter of iustification in the sight of God, no excellency of any gift (be it faith it selfe) is of any moment, for faith doth not iustifie, for the dignity of it, but as an instrument apprehending that wich doth iustifie. The due consideration of these two things will be an ex∣cellent meanes to keep our hearts from swelling in respect of any gift of God bestowed vpon vs. One thing more is offered to our consideration from
these words rashly puft vp with his fleshly minde. We are to marke that the Apostle giues this epithite, & and this title to the minde that is fleshly. Hence it follow∣eth directly, that the word (fleshly) in Scripture signifies more than sensuality, it is put many times in Scripture to signifie the corruption of the chiefe faculties of the soule,The word (flesh) in scrip¦ture signifies sometimes the corruption of the chiefe fa∣mily of the soule. euen of the mind and conscience, & hence it is very cleere, that euen the minde and vnderstanding not regenerate, is fleshly, therfore the Apostle sayth, Ro. 8.7. the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subiect to the Law of God neither indeed can be. Which must needes be vnderstood of the very best part of the soule, wherein wisedome is seated, and Gal 5.20. the Apostle reckons heresie, which is an errour of the minde and vnderstanding among the workes of the flesh & heer∣upon one speakes thus; saith he, the Apostle ascribes those sinnes to the flesh,Note. which beare principall sway in the Di∣uell, who certainely hath no flesh, for he saith, enmity, con∣tention, emulation, enuy, are workes of the flesh, the head and fountaine whereof is pride, which raignes in the Di∣uell  though he haue no flesh. This I obserue to meet with the errour of the Papists,Confutation of the Papists. who teach that the word flesh in the Scripture opposed to spirit, signifies onely sensuality, & the corruption of the inferior parts of the soule, which is slat against the plaine euidence of this, & many other pla∣ces of Scripture. And we are to take knowledge of it, that  euen our mindes not regenerate are flesh and corrupt, and so labour to be renued in the spirit of our minde,We must la∣bour especial∣ly for the re∣nouation of our mindes. as the A∣postle exhorteth, Ephes. 4.23. Yea, let vs especially labour, for the renouation of our mindes, the darkenesse and ignorance in the mind brings foorth nothing but sinne, in all the powers of the soule, and as before the fall the minde retayned the cheife part of the image of God,Note so nowe beeing corrupted it is most corrupt and the greater naturall giftes of minde wee haue, as wit, capacty, iudgement &c. the fitter
instruments we haue to increase in sinne: therefore let vs neuer rest till we finde, by the vse of the good meanes that we are renued in our mindes. VER. 19. And holdeth not the head, whereof all the bo∣die furnished and knit together by ioints and bands increaseth with the increasing of God. In this Verse, the Apostle doth continue his descrip∣tion of false teachers, such as laboured to draw the Colossi∣ans away from the truth; and he further sets them out to be such, as did not truely acknowledge, nor cleaue to Christ the head of his Church, in the first words (And hol∣deth not the head) and hauing made mention of Christ vnder the word of similitude (head) hee then descendeth into a description of Christ, as he hath relation and refe∣rence to his mysticall body the Church, as the head of it, and hee describes him to bee as an head giuing life and growth to his whole Church, and to euery member of it, (we taking these words together) whereof all the body incre∣seth, as indeed they are to bee taken in the purpose of the Apostle, the words betweene them (furnished and knit to∣gether by ioints and bands) are a declaration of the quality and condition of that body to which Christ as an head giues life and growth, that it is a body furnished and knit together by ioints and bands, as if the words were read thus. Whereof all the body thus qualified (namely) furni∣shed and knit together by ioints and bands increaseth, in the last words is specified what kinde of growth and in∣crease it is, that Christ as an head giues to the body his Church, (namely) a diuine and spirituall increase, (increa∣seth with the increasing of God. Come wee to the words of this verse,Interpre∣tation. as they are laid downe by the Apostle, And holdeth not the head (that is) acknowlegeth not the head, nor cleaueth to it in his doctrine
for the Apostle heere speakes of false teachers, such as sought to bring in false doctrine of the worship of Angels, and his meaning is, that they in that their doctrine did not acknowledge nor cleaue (as they ought) to the head, (that is) to Christ, who is as an head to his Church: they did not acknowledge Christ to bee the onely head, and cleaue to him as the onely head of the Church' (whereof) the originall words signifie not (of which) with a reference to the word (head) they are not , but  of whom with re∣lation to Christ (all) (that is) the whole body (namely) the Church, which is an one body consisting of many members conioined in one body. Thus then conceiue we these words, And holdeth not the head, whereof all the body increaseth. As if the Apostle had said, And doth not in his doctrine acknowledge nor cleaue to Christ as the only head of his Church of whom the whole Church as one entire body increaseth. Now heere, first obserue we that our Apostle doth taxe false teachers to be such as hold not Christ the head of his Church, and why? because they taught inuocation and adoration of Angels, hence then it is very cleare that such as tread in their steps, and now teach intercession and me∣diation of Angels and Saints, hold not Christ the head;They who teach interce∣ssion and me∣diation of Angels and Saints hold not Christ the head of his Church. plead what they will, indeed they doe not truely acknow∣ledge Christ to be the onely head of his Church. The reason of this is manifest,  because Christ is head of his Church as he is mediator, God and man, therefore they that acknowledge other mediators besides Christ, as Angels and Saints,  set vp also other heads, and hold not him to be the onely head of his Church.Conuiction of the Papists not to hold Christ the head of the Church. Let then the Papists say what they will in defence of their inuocation of Angels and Saints, they cannot possi∣ble auoide the euidence of this text of the Apostle con∣uincing
them in respect of that to bee such as hold not Christ the head of his Church. Now in that the Apostle saith, holdeth not the head, mea∣ning Christ, (whereof all the whole body) meaning the Church: We are giuen to vnderstand thus much, That there is the same relation and vnion betweene  Christ and his Church, that there is betweene the head of a man and the body;There is the same relation and vnion be∣tweene Christ & his Church that there is betweene the head & body of a man. and this comparison is often vsed in Scripture, to set out the relation and vnion that is be∣twixt Christ and his Church, Ephe. 1.22. the Apostle saith, God appointed Christ to be the head of his Church, which is his body. And that wee may rightly conceiue that the relation and vnion that is betweene Christ and his Church, com-Church pared to a head and a body. Know we first that there beeing two natures in Christ, his diuine and humane, Christ is the head to his Church, in respect of both,Chhrist is head to his Church in re∣spect of both his natures. euen whole Christ God and man; for he is so the head, as he is the Sauiour of his Church▪ These two are conioined by the Apostle, Ephes. 5.23. Christ is the head of his Church and the same is the Sauiour of his body. Now Christ is the Sauiour of his Church, not ac∣cording to his diuine nature alone, nor according to his humane nature alone, but whole Christ in his Godhead, and in his soule and flesh; Therefore whole Christ is the head of his Church, and the Church and euery true mem∣ber is vnited to whole Christ, yet in this order. First to the flesh and manhood of Christ, and then by that to the Godhead. Secondly, wee are to knowe that though the vnion whereby Christ and his Church are conioined be a true and reall vnion; yet is it not naturall, as when two things are ioined in one nature, nor personall, as the soule and body are vnited; nor politicall or ciuill, as the Prince and people are conioined: but it is mysticall and spirituall by the bond of the same spirit,The vnion of Christ and his Church is mysticall. and by faith. Thus then
stand we this truth, that Christ both God and man in re∣spect of both his natures after a spiritual manner is knit to all the elect of God, called, iustified, and sanctified, and so we are to conceiue of the relation and vnion that is be∣tweene Christ and his Church, compared to an head and a body. And first of all, this may serue to confirme that truth of Doctrine deliuered in our Church. That as many as truely beleeue in Christ, they are iusti∣fied by his righteousnesse imputed to them;True belee∣uers are iusti∣fied by Christ his righteous∣nesse imputed vnto them. for, there being that relation and vnion betweene Christ and his members, that there is betweene the head and the body; it must needs be that the graces and benefits of Christ do truely and really belong to them, and what Christ did as mediator God and man by the couenant of grace, is tru∣ly imputed to them that are one with him, by the bond of his spirit and true faith: we know that what is done by the head in a naturall body, is ascribed to the whole body. So what was done by Christ as mediator, and so the head of his mysticall body may be truly imputed to all the mem∣bers of that body. Let then the Papists scoffe at our doctrine of imputed righteousnesse as absurd, as if one should be said to liue by the soule of another, or learned by the learning of ano∣ther: let vs acknowledge and embrace it, as grounded on that neere vnion that is beweene Christ and his members we being so neerely conioind to Christ, that we are of his flesh and bones, as the Apostle saith, Ephes. 5.30. Wee must needs bee iust by his righteousnesse, euen his by in∣herencie, and ours, giuen vnto vs by God, and apprehen∣ded by faith. Againe, is it so that there is the same relation and vnion betwixt Christ and his Church, as is betwixt the head and the body of a man. Then let this be a ground of patience and of comfort to all true beleeuers in time of any afflicti∣on;Our vnion with Christ is a ground of patience and comfort in time of affli∣ction. let them know that their affliction reacheth vp to
Christ their head; himselfe hath said it, that when they are hungrie, thirstie, a stranger, naked, sicke, and in prison, he is hungry, thirstie, a stranger, naked, sicke, and in prison, Mat. 25.35.36. Act 9.3. When Saul breathed out threatnings, and slaughter against the Church, hee saith, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me. Christ bearing part with vs in our afflictions, certainly he will, either mo∣derate the weight of them, or giue strength to beare them, or he will put an end to them. Consider then in time of affliction besides this, that af∣flictions are thy lot and portion ineuitable, and Christ hath gone before thee and drunke of that cuppe, and thou art conformable to Christ in suffering, and they are but for a time; all which may minister matter of great com∣fort vnto thee. Yet consider, besides these things that thy sufferings and afflictions reach vp to Christ thine head and thou shalt finde it will be a notable meanes to lift vp thy fainting heart in thy greatest affliction; a man wil not suffer smart in the least of his members, if he can helpe it; and shall Christ to whom all power is giuen, in heauen, and in earth, suffer himselfe long to be pinched in any one of his members? certainelie no, he will not, we haue not an high priest that cannot bee touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb. 4.15. He hath had experience of them, and therefore will, after we haue suffered a little sea∣son, appeare to our comfort, Reuel. 6.11. Let vs then re∣ioice, saith Peter, 1. Epist. 4.13. in asmuch as we are per∣takers of Christs sufferings, that when his glory shall ap∣peare, we may be glad and reioice, and bee made pertakers of his glory in heauen. Before I leaue this point, I hold it meete to discouer a Popish error.A popish er∣ror described. The Papists they teach, that in regard of our vnion with Christ, the afflictions of beleeuers are merito∣rious, and doe satisfie the iustice of God, and purchase his fauour. For, say they,  we being vnited to Christ our sufferings
receiue vertue from him to merit, though in themselues, we confesse with the Apostle, Rom. 8.18. They are not worthy of the glory that shall be reuealed vnto vs, yet in that wee are members of Christ, they receiue influence from him our head, and are raised vp to higher estimate, euen to merit Gods fauour. See the craft of these men, to deceiue the simple, and their owne soules. I answer them, our vnion with Christ can be no ground of merit. From thence they can neuer proue the afflicti∣ons of true beleeuers to be meritorious, because our vnion with Christ is not personall, but mysticall; for personall vnion is the ground of merit, euen in Christ himselfe. His manhood apart could merit nothing, they must then proue, that we beleeuing in Christ, are receiued into vnity of person with Christ, before they can truely conclude, that our afflictions do merit or satisfie; but this they are neuer able to doe, and therefore they build vpon the sand, and we are to renounce it as a popish error and vntruth, that our sufferings, by reason of our vnion with Christ, are meritorious. Marke we further, the Apostle saith, holdeth not the head (wherof or of whom) with relation to Christ (for so wee ex∣pound the words) he saith, not from whom, but of whom. Hence we are put in minde of a difference betweene the members of Christ, and such as are not his members. The members of Christ are of Christ, others are onely from him,Christ his members are of him, others are only from him. as are all creatures, for all things that are, are the creatures of Christ, as he is God, and so from him, but it is proper and peculiar to the members of Christ to be of him. Deceiue not then thy selfe, whosoeuer thou art, if thou be not of Christ, euen one with him, by the bond of his spirit, thou art not a member of Christ,If thou be not of Christ thou art not a mem∣ber of Christ. and then thou art only in the common condition of all creatures, thou art no neerer heauen then the oxe or the horse as yet, for they be the creatures of Christ, as he is God and so, and if thou
die in that state, thou art in farre worse case then the very toade or venemous Serpent, for their death is an end of their misery, but thine is a beginning of endlesse woe with∣out ease or remedy. Obserue yet further, it is not to be passed ouer without obseruation that the Apostle saith, Christ is the head, of whom all the body, he saith not, of whom the body, but of whom all the body increaseth. Hence then it is cleare, that he is the only head of the vni∣uersall  Church,Christ is the only head of the vniuesall Church. and it cannot be giuen to the Pope, or any other: as for the deuised distinction of the new Papists, of head imperiall and ministeriall, it is, both without warrant of the word of God, and foolish; it implies a contradicti∣on, for to be head argues preheminence and superioritie,  The Pope is not head of the Church. and to be ministeriall, argues subiection and inferioritie, therefore these two can neuer agree to the same subiect. Hence take we further notice that Christ is the head of  all that beleeue in him, his graces, benefits, and workes, as he is mediator belong to them all;Christ his gra¦ces, benefits, and works, as he is mediator belong to all true beleeuers. yea, as Christ by his gracious dispensation is head of his mysticall body, hee cannot spare any of his members, but euery one is requi∣red to his perfection and fulnesse: so saith the Apostle, Ephes. 1.23.Note. He is the head to his Church which is the bodie, euen the fulnesse of him that filleth all in all things, which is an excellent sweet comfort to all true beleeuers,Consolation. it may giue them assurance that they shall neuer be cut of from Christ: for why? Christ as the head of his Church is not perfect without euery one of his members, and ther∣fore it is not possible that any one of them should bee cast off and seuered from him. The head of the naturall body may be cut off and seuered from the body, but Christ the head of his Church being not perfect without euery one of his members, will not suffer any one of them to bee cut off from him. This also duly considered that Christ is the head, of all  that beleeue, may minister great comfort to poore wret∣ches,
such as bee of low degree in the world,Comfort to the poore de∣spised mem∣bers of Christ on whom proud rufflers looke so bigge: if they beleeue in Christ, they haue as much interest in all his benefits and merits as the greatest; be not then cast down in respect of thy meane condition in the world, thou art despised and made the foote-stoole of proud and great ones in this world; care not for it, beleeue in Iesus Christ, and thou hast as good part in him, and art as deere and neere to him, as the grea∣test Monarch in the world, he is the head, and therefore as kinde and louing, as good and gracious, as bountifull and beneficiall to thee, as to any other whosoeuer, and thinke on that to thy comfort. Now wee are to come to the quality and condition of that body to which Christ as an head giues life and growth, expressed in the next words (furnished and knit to∣gether by ioints and bonds) where the Apostle sets out the body of Christ, by two conditions. First, that it is such a body as is not in want but euery way furnished. Secondly, that it is a body compacted and knit toge∣ther, and then he makes known the instruments or meanes whereby it is furnished and knit together (namely) by ioints and bonds. Interpreta∣tion.I will briefly lay forth the meaning of these words (fur∣nished) the originall word signifieth, vnder supplied or, furnished, as the members of the body are vnder the head, and furniture beeing a word of relation implying some thing, wherewithall a thing is furnished, it signifieth sup∣plied or furnished with that which is answerable to the furniture, that comes from the head to the members of the naturall body (namely) to the furniture of life, sense, and motion, and particular ability of euery member, as of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, concocting, and the like, that as the body is vnder-supplied with life, sense and motion, and with particular ability of euery mem∣ber needfull, from the head, so the body of the Church
is vnder fupplied from Christ the head with spirituall life, motion, abilitie and grace, both with grace of holines and regeneration, & with particular grace needfull, (knit toge∣ther) this refpecteth the members themselues, & the word signifieth compacted or conioyned with a most straight & indissoluble band (by ioynts & bands) the Apostle doth still continue his similitude, that as the parts of the naturall bo∣dy are furnished from the head & knit both to the head, & one to another by ioints & sinewes, so is it in the mysticall body of Christ, the members of that body are furnished with grace & knit both to the head, & one to another, as it were by ioints & sinews, & by ioints & bands in this place we are to vnderstand spiritual ioints & ligamentsThere be three spirituall ioints and li∣gaments. by which the furniture of grace is conuaid from Christ to his mem∣bers, & they knit both to him, & one to another and those are three. First the spirit of Christ, Rom. 8.9. if any man haue not the spirit of Christ, the same is not his, Ephes. 4, 4. one body one spirit, by his spirit Christ doth communicate his graces to vs, and we to our brethren. Secondly, faith, for by faith wee apprehend Christ and are made one with Christ, and by the same we cherish, com∣fort and stir vp one another mutuallie in good things Ro. 1.11.12. I long to see you (saith the Apostle) that I might bestow among you some spirituall gift to strengthen you, that is, that I might be cōforted together with you throgh mutuall faith both yours & mine, for with faith is alwaies ioined the band of loue & peace, faith worketh by loue.Gal. 5.6. Thirdlie, our seuerall callings (not those by which wee stand in relation, onelie to the common-wealth, and may bee seruiceable onlie in things belonging to the bodie as our seuerall trades and occupations) but wherby we stand in relation to Christ, as the calling of the Minister, Fa∣ther: Master. Husband and the like, for these also are spi∣rituall ioints and bands. This then is the full sence and meaning of the Apostle in these wordes as if hee had said.
Being furnished or vnder supplied from Christ the head of his Church with the grace of holinesse and regeneration and with particular grace needefull for euery member, and the members of it being neerly conioyned one to another, that furniture descending downe from the head to the members, & that coniunction of the members both to the head, and one to another being by meanes of the spirit of Christ, by faith and by seuerall callings in the Church, as by so many ioynts and bands. Now first from this word furnished) in that the Apostle saith, that all the body is furnished from Christ the head, we are plainely taught that euery member of Christ receiueth vertue from Christ, & is furnished with a measure of grace from him,Euery mem∣ber of Christ receiues ver∣tue frō Christ, & is furnished with a mea∣sure of grace from him. euery one hath a measure of spirituall life and holines conuaied from Christ, yea, euery one hath his par∣ticular grace, as the wholebody of a man, & euery member of the body to the least finger suckes vertue from the head, & the head is powerfull to cause it to liue, so is it in the my∣sticall body of Christ, there is not a member of that body but it receiues some vertue, from the head the Lord Iesus, yea, euery one receiues his owne particular grace, Christ is effectuall in euerie one from the hiest to the lowest. Eph. 4.16. the Apostle sayth, Christ is the head by whom all the body being coupled, and knit together by euery ioynt for the furniture therof (according to the effectuall power, which is in the measure of euery part) receiueth encrease of the body vnto the edifying of it selfe in loue, the Apostle hauing recounted many gifts & graces of the holy Spirit, ver. 11, concludes thus. All these things worketh euen the selfe same spirit, distributing to euery man seuerally as he will.  Now if any aske the question, whether Christ the head of his Church doe furnish euery one of his members with like measure of grace or no. I answer  no, he giues to som more to some lesse as euery on shall be an instrument of his glory & as euery one hath need either in doing or suffring more or lesse then others, no doubt Iob & other excellent
worthies, had a greater measure of patience giuen then o∣thers, that were not to vndergo such trials as they did ther∣fore saith the Apostle, Eph. 4.7. to euery one is giuen grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ, and that we mistake not this poynt, know we that Christ giues to euery one of his members an equall measure of his grace for their iustification,Note. one is not more or lesse iustified then another by the grace of Christ, but not an equall measure of inhe∣rent holinesse to their sanctification, nor an equall measure of particular gifts & graces, but to some & more some lesse according to his own good pleasure, and as euery one hath need, and we are not to enuy such as haue greater gifts then our selues (that by the way) for the point in hand it is cleer by that which hath beene said, that euery member of Christ receiues vertue from him, and is furnished with a measure of grace, it is not possible that any that are in Christ should be destitute of grace, and altogether want holinesse, and therefore deceiue not thy selfe whosoeuet thou art, if thou be a member of the mysticall body of Christ, thou canst not want furniture of grace in some measure, Christ is the head of whom all the body is furnished. Heereby then trie thy selfe, whether thou belong to that  body or no;Triall of our selues whe∣ther we be∣long to the body of Christ or no. euery one will be held a member of Christ & come to the table of the Lord to seale vp his vnion and fel∣lowship with him, but where is that life of grace and holi∣nesse conuayd from Christ to his members? can wee per∣swade our selues we are members of Christ, and yet liue as many do the life of nature, doing that which is good in our owne eyes according to the lusts of our owne hearts? for what should I say of our breaking the Sabboth, blasphe∣mous oathes, drunkennesse, cursed and bitter speeches and the like? is it possible that an heart so furnished and full of such corruption, is knit to Christ, and a member of Christ? surely we might aswell say, that a woodden legge, neither knit hy common bond, nor hauing heat in it, is a member of a mans body.
Againe, where is that effectuall working of Christ that putteth life and nimblenesse into his members,Reproofe of those that want spiritual life & nimble∣nesse in good things, and yet thinke they are the mem∣bers of Christ. in good things. In matters of the world, wee haue great dexterity wee are apt to conceiue, fit to contriue for the best aduan∣tage, because wee sauour the things of the world, but in matters of holinesse and religion, many of vs are frozen and benumb'd, and as it were without life, and can wee yet fancy, that wee are members of Christ? Surely, if wee thinke so, wee deceiue our selues, S. Iohn sayth, 1. Ioh. 1.6. if wee say wee haue fellowship with God who is light, and yet walke in darkenesse, we lie: so if wee say, we are one with Crhist, and haue fellowship with him who is full of grace, Ioh. 1.14. and yet receiue not of his ful∣nesse, some measure of grace, certainely wee haue no con∣iunction with Christ the head of his Church, and then consider what followes on that; if wee haue not Christ our head in this life, we shall haue him our iudge and con∣demner in the life to come: and as in this life wee haue but a supposed vnion with Christ.Note. So in the life to come wee shall haue but an imaginarie fellowship with him; and in∣deede a finall separation from him and from his Angels and Saints: And we shall haue fellowship with the Diuell and his Angels. In that the Apostle saith further, the body of the Church whereof Christ is the head is knit together. Wee are giuen to vnderstand, that such as are of the mysticall bodie of Christ; are as neerely conioyned as members of one body,Such as bee of the mysticall body of Christ are as neerely knit together as the mem∣bers of one body. and this the Apostle teacheth plainely, 1. Cor. 12.12. As the bodie (saith hee) is one and hath many members, and all the members of the bo∣dy which is one, though they bee many, yet are but one body, euen so is Christ (that is) Christ mysticall or the mysticall bodye of Christ, Romans 12.5. The Apo∣stle sayth, that beleeuers beeing many are not onely one body in Christ, but euery one, one anothers members euen as members one of another. A speach worthy obser∣uation,
we are so neerely knit together in the mysticall body of Christ, that we are as it were a leg or an arme one of another. Now, before I come to make vse of this, a doubtA doubt. is to bee remooued. It may seeme in that the members of the mysticall body of Christ are conioined as the members of the naturall body, and there is as neere an vnion between them, and so doubtlesse a good agreement of minde, and inward affection among them; it may seeme (I say) that vnity is an infallible note of the Church, as the Papists teach, and that where there is vnity and consent of minds and iudgements, there is the Church. To this I answer:  first, the Church is not one body sim∣ply considered, by, or in it selfe, but in relation to Christ, (that is) the members of Christ must be ioined with him by his spirit and faith, and then one with another, therfore it is not the consent of men, though neuer so wise, but on∣lie in Christ, and in good things that can demonstrate and point out the Church. Againe, consent is not simply an infallible note of the Church, for it is sometime amongst the wicked, as among Iosephs brethren, and among the Sodomites, and in the king∣dome of darknesse, Luk 11.21. And dissention may bee somtimes among the godly, Paul and Barnabas dissented, Act. 15.39. Paul and Peter, Gal. 2.14. There were schismes in Corinth. 1. Epist. 1.11. Consent therefore, is not simply a noteNote. of the Church, vnlesse it be in true faith and doctrine. Let not then a glorious name of consent dazell our eies  and make vs thinke the Church is where true faith and doctrine is not found. And for vse of the point, it may serue as a ground of perswasion to mutuall loue,A ground of perswasion to mutuall loue. which is, an argument, we haue often occasion to speak of, & it can∣not be to often vrged in these daies, wherin mens harts are ful of rancor, and malice, and distracted, & drawn asunder one from another: let vs therfore consider that we are knit together as members of one body, yea as members one of
another and therefore ought to loue as members of one body,Christian loue is to bee ex∣pressed in two things. and to expresse our loue one to another, and that chiefely in two things. First, in communicating the good things we haue either inward or outward to others, accor∣ding to their wants and our abundance as Iob sayth, hee was the eyes to the blinde, and the feete to the lame. Iob. 29.13. Secondly in a fellow-feeling of the wants one of another, if the foot be hurt the tongue laments it, the eyes weepe for it, the head akes, and the heart grieues for it, so must it bee with vs in respect of the miseries and afflictions one of another, we are to bee touched with their griefes, feele the waight of their burdens, bee pressed with their bonds, as if we our selues were banished with them. Now to stirre vs vp to these duties, much might be sayd, but consider we these two things. First, consider the state of the body, if one member de∣ny to communicate the good it hath receiued to another, as if the eye refuse to guide the feete by the sight of it, wee know the feete may stumble and endanger the whole bo∣dy, or if the foot be wounded, and the eyes refuse to look on it, the hands to handle it, danger may come to the whole body, so if we deny to communicate the good we haue receiued to others that stand in need of it, besides this if the Lord may blow on our good gifts, & rise vp in iudg∣ment against vs, we hazard the state of the body whereof we are members, Againe, consider that our communicating good to our brethren, and our simpathy and fellow-feeling of their mi∣series, is a sure testimony of our vnion with Christ, for our vnion with Christ doth nothing profit God, thogh a thou∣sand worlds were vnited vnto him,Note hee hath set ouer the profit of that vnion to others, as our Sauiour said to Peter, Ioh. 21.16. Peter louest thou me; then feed my sheep, as if he had said, make it knowen thou art one with me, and lo∣uest me, by doing good to them that are mine. If then we would not be guilty of so great a sinne, as endangering the
state of the body whereof we are members, which is a sinne against the light and order of nature, and if we would haue such testimony as cannot deceiue vs, that we are one with Christ the head of his Church; let vs be stirred vp not to loue in word and in tongue onely, Ioh. 3.18. but to ex∣presse our loue one to another, both by communicating the good things we haue one to another, and by a fellow-feeling of the miseries and afflictions one of another, haue wee wisdom? Let vs bestow it to the good of the ignorant, haue we holines? let vs make the best of it, to the winning of others, haue we plenty of outward things? let vs therein communicate to others according to their neede and our abundance. Onely one thing more I will note from these wordes (furnished and knit together by ioynts and bonds) and then descend to that which followeth. In that our Apo∣stle sayth, that the body of the Church is furnished & knit together in ioynts and bonds (that is) by meanes of the spirit and by faith in Christ, and by seuerall callings, wee  are giuen to vnderstand, that not onely the spirit of Christ, & faith wherof there is no question, but euen euery mans calling, by which he stands in relation to Christ, is or ought to be as a ioynt or a sinew not only for coniunction of him with Christ & with the members of Christ, but for conuey∣ance of grace to others;Euery mans calling wher∣by he stands in relation to Christ, is or ought to be as a ioynt or si∣new to con∣uay grace to others. euery mans calling by which hee stands in relation to Christ (that is) that ranke, that order and degree any one hath in the mysticall body of Christ, as he is a member of Christ, and is of this or that order in the mysticall body of Christ, as a beleeuing minister, father, or the like, euen that calling and degree of euery beleeuer, by which he hath speciall relation to other members of Christ is to be as a ioynt or sinew for the conuayance of grace to them, by that calling and degree, he is to transmit & con∣uay the grace of Christ to those that are next to him, and to furnish them with the grace that hee hath receiued from Christ himselfe; euery calling in the mysticall body of Christ, being a iuncture or bond, by which wee are ioyned
and bound to others, the Apostle hath taught vs, it must be a ioynt of subministration or vnder furnishing others with grace, Ephes. 4.16. in the originall the words are by euery ioynt of subministration &c. and this truth is grounded on that generall exhortation of the Apostle Peter, 1. Epist. 4, 10. let euery one as he hath receiued the gift minister the same one to another, as good disposers of the manifolde grace of God, euery one according to the measure of grace receiued & according to his ability is to further the good of the mysticall body of Christ, & being as a ioynt or a sinew in that body in respect of some particular calling hee is in that calling, to do the office of a ioynt or sinew, he is to bee as the ioynt is to the body euen a meanes to conuay down grace to those to whom he stands in speciall relation: the fa∣ther to the children, the husband to the wife, the master to his seruants, yea, and one brother to another▪ one fellow-seruant to another one neighbor to another, is to bee as a ioint or sinew for conueiance of grace one to another, which is a duty not known to many in the world. Some are of o∣pinion, and if the question were asked what they thinke, they would so answer, that it is a duty proper and peculiar to the minister of the word, to bee an instrument vnder Christ for the conuayance of grace to the soule of men; & that it is a thing nothing at all concerning them, they hold themselues exempted and freed from that duty, I appeale  to mens own consciences, whether many haue not thus thought,Euery one in his particu∣lar calling is to bee a means to con∣uay grace to others that be vnder him. learne then whosoeuer thou art, to reforme thy mind & iudgement, art thou a father, a master, an husband, a neighbor &c. know it is thy duty to be a meanes to con∣uay grace to those that are vnder thee, or to whom thou slandest in any speciall relation: though principally it con∣cernes the minister to edifie the body of Christ. Eph. 4.12. yet the Apostle hath layd it on all Christians as a generall duty, 1. Thess. 5.11. edifie one another, though the Mini¦ster be the mouth of the people to God, yet, S. Iames hath taught, lam. 5.16. that we are to pray one for another.
Now these duties generally appertaining to all Christi∣ans doe certainely more neerely concerne them, as they haue speciall relation one to an other, &c. the father, the master, the husband, the minister, are to edifie their chil∣dren, their seruants, their wife, the body of Christ &c. in grace and goodnesse, and to send vp a message to heauen, and to call vpon the Lord by praier for them. Now then to stirre vs vp in this duty wherein many are much wanting, yea the most are so farre from this dutie, that they minister nothing but infection to the soules of such as be vnder them; no childe, no seruant, no not the wife of their owne bosome hath any helpe by them, to their saluation, their houses are nurseries of cursing, swea∣ring, lying, ribaldrie, and all manner of impiety.Motiues to stirre vp to this duty. And therfore to stirre vs vp to the duty now laid before vs, con∣sider we: First that the want of this duty is one principall cause  that such as be vnder vs, profit not (as they might) by the publike ministry of the word; as in the naturall body when there is a stop in the ioint, or a conuulsion, and the sinnewes are drawn vp: the parts adioining thriue not, so is it in the mystical body of Christ when such as are as ioints in respect of their place and calling, are not meanes to conuey grace to such as are vnder them, they cannot so well thriue in grace. Againe, the neglect of this dutie will one day be most  grieuous to the conscience, when a man shall call to mind, that whereas he ought to haue beene a meanes to further the saluation of others, he hath beene rather a meanes to further their damnation; no doubt it will bee an heauy burden to his conscience: yea, as one saith, it shall bee an aggrauation of his torment in hell, when he shall haue o∣thers that haue perished by his default, foaming out con∣tinuall curses against him, and accusing him for euer as the murtherer of their soules. Add to this a consideration of comfort and blessing,
attending on the carefull performance of this dutie; as the neglect of it is full of bitternesse, so doubtlesse the practise of it must needes be full of sweetenesse; and the blessing of it is that which the Lord vouchsafed to Abraham, Gen. 18.17. he will reueale his secrets to such, and wil hide no∣thing from them that may be for their good, and for their comfort, if then we desire that such as be vnder vs, should profit by the publike ministry of the word; if wee would not haue their not profiting as they ought, by our meanes to be a discomfort to vs when we haue most need of com∣fort, if we desire the blessing of the Lord vpon vs in the re∣uelation of his secrets and counsels: yea, the light of his countenance to our comfort, both in life and death. Let vs then be stirred vp to the practice of this duty, let vs by instruction, counsell, admonition, consolation, praier, &c. be meanes to conuey grace to those, with whom we stand in any speciall relation; and remember that we in our se∣uerall orders and degrees are as ioints and sinewes, and let vs do the office of ioints and sinewes in the mystical body of Christ. Interpre∣tation.Come we to the last words of this verse (increaseth with the increasing of God.) In these words the Apostle makes knowne vnto vs, that Christ the head giueth growth and increase to the body of the Church. And what kinde of growth it is (namely) an increase of God: there is an in∣crease of the Church, when the number of beleeuers in∣creased, whereof we read, Act. 5.47. That the Lord added to the Church from day to day such as should bee saued, but that is not heere meant, the meaning of the Apostle in these words, is briefly this. That the whole Church, and euery member of the mysticall body of Christ, receiues increase from Christ the head, in regard of spirituall grace, as of faith, hope, loue, patience, &c. which hee calles the increase of God, because it is diuine and spiri∣tuall.
Hence we are first plainely taught, that both the begin∣ning  and increase of grace is from Christ,Both the be∣ginning and increase of grace is from Christ. of him as of the head, saith the Apostle, all the body of the Church, and euery member of that body is furnished with grace, and being furnished increaseth, he giues both the furniture of grace, and the increase of it, they are both his free giftes, freelie giuen not vpon any desert of ours, and that is further manifest by the different measure of grace, in that some haue more, and some lesse; for that cannot come from any difference of beleeuers iustified, because one is not more iustified then an other; there is no ine∣quality betweene them in that respect. Therefore it must needs be from the meere good will and pleasure of Christ, that some haue a greater measure of grace, and some a lesse, and so both the beginning and increase of grace is the free gift of Christ; so saith the Apostle plainely, Eph. 4.7. To euery one is giuen grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. This I note in a word,  to let vs see that it is not for the good vsage of any grace, or by our manuring of the gifts of God, as the Papists speake and teach that wee me∣rit the increase of them;Our good v∣sage of grace & our manu∣ring of Gods gifts doth not merit the in∣crease of them No, no, both the grace and the increase of it in euery member of the Church is from the meere good pleasure of Christ. They obiect,  that which is in the parable, Mat. 25.29. To euery one that hath shall bee giuen, and hee shall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath shall be taken away. Say they, he that hath any ta∣lent and vseth it well, to him it shall be giuen, and he shall haue abundance, as a remuneration or reward of his good vsage of it. The meaning of our Sauiour is,  that hee who vseth his talent well shall haue a blessing vpon it for the increase of it, and not a remuneration for the good vsage of it; as may appeare by the scope and drift of the parable, which is to stirre men vp to diligence. Christ giues to his mem∣bers
both the grace and the increase of it freely, he will bee good onely because he hath beene good, and adde mercy to mercy: in the next place we may easilie see this conclu∣sion laid befor vs. That euerie true member of Christ increaseth in spiri∣tuall graces,Euery true member of Christ increa∣seth in spiri∣tuall graces. euery true beleeuer increaseth in faith, hope, loue, humility, and other graces giuen, and continually goes from one measure to another. And hence it is, that their spirituall life is in Scripture compared to the ages of men; some are babes in Christ, some children, and some are of riper age, and their holi∣nesse is compared to the morning light, which shines bri∣ter and brighter, Isai. 58.8. And it is the exhortation of the Apostle Peter, 2. Epist. 3.18. grow in grace. The reasons and grounds of this, are these two. First, because the whole worke of grace in any mem∣ber of Christ, is from the will of Christ, which is vnchange∣able; therefore where he begins any grace, hee will more and more perfect it. Againe, all the members of the mysticall body of Christ are liuing members, 1. Pet. 2.5. They are said to be liuing flames; therefore euer growing. For the spirituall life of grace cannot be idle, but is euer going on from on degree to another: and howsoeuer the members of Christ doe sometimes fall of infirmitie and sinne grieuously; yet Christ their head, of his goodnesse turneth that sinne of theirs to good vnto them, for they rise againe more thank∣full to him, more humble in themselues, more milde and equall towards their brethren, and more wary ouer them∣selues, and they cleaue faster to Christ. Therefore they daily increase and goe on in grace. Vse Triall whe∣ther grace be truly wrought in vs, or no.Let this then be a ground of triall to euery one of vs, do wee perswade our selues we haue knowledge, faith, hu∣mility, any other grace or sanctification. Let vs heereby try our selues, if that grace be truly wrought, certainly it will increase, and if it doe not, it is but a counterfet resem∣blance
of grace:Note. nature can put on the counterfet of any grace, a man may transforme himselfe into the likenesse of any grace; but the differēce is, this counterfet grace will not increase, it is but as a painted tree, it will neuer grow greater; but grace truely wrought, is like the graine of musterdseed cast into the earth, Mat. 13.32. Small at the first, but when it is growne, it is the greatest among herbs. If then we would not deceiue our selues, let vs not rest in the beginnings of grace, but as the Apostle exhorts, 2. Tim. 1.6. Stir vp the gifts of God which are in vs. And by the vse of good meanes, as hearing, reading, and medita∣ting in the word and praier; and know wee that the Sa∣crament of the Lords Supper is a principall meanes that God hath ordained for the strengthning of faith, and in∣crease of grace in vs; because it is not onely a Sacrament of nourishment and confirmation of faith, but because the remembrance and faith we haue in the merit of Christ his passion which is most liuely set before vs in that Sacra∣ment, is the only thing that giues vs strength and comfort against all temptations. Therefore they shew themselues gracelesse, and indeed not the members of Christ, who careleslie neglect that Sacrament. If we perswade ourselues wee haue any grace, let vs bee carefull to vse this and all other good meanes that serue for the increase of it, and labour still to goe on from on measure of grace to an other till we become of ripe age and perfect strength in Christ.
VER. 20. Wherefore if yee be dead with Christ, from the ordinances of the world, why? as though ye li∣ued in the world, are yee burdened with tra∣ditions. This verse hath relation to that which is immediately foregoing, on this manner; in the verse before the Apo∣stle shewes that there is that neere vnion betweene Christ and his Church, that there is betweene the head and the body; and what Christ did as mediator the members of his Church did it with him: when hee died, they died with him: hereupon the Apostle doth inferre in this verse, Wherefore if yee be dead with Christ, &c. In this verse the A∣postle beginnes to deale against the corruption of Religi∣on, and against seducement and drawing away the Colos∣sians from the truth, by meanes of certaine humane de∣crees and traditions, that false teachers sought to thrust vpon them, as things necessary to be obserued for religi∣on and conscience sake, and needfull to saluation: and in this verse is laid downe his first argument of confutati∣on of them. An argument confuting hu∣mane decrees and traditionsThe argument is this. Yee are freed by Christ from the rites and cere∣monies of the Law, therefore you ought not to be subiect to mens decrees and traditions that seeme to be deriued from thence. Some would haue the argument in this place to be from the greater to the lesse. Thus Yee are not now subiect to the rites and ceremo∣nies of the Law being freed from them by Christ, therefore much lesse ought you to bee subiect to rites and ceremonies that are inuented by the braine of men. But as I take it, the argument is not so, but as now I haue laid it downe. For it is not like that the false teachers
of those times sought to impose on the Colossians any o∣ther things then such as were either taken from Philoso∣phy, and the learning of the Gentiles, or from the cere∣moniall Law of Moses, and such were their traditions here spoken of, it may appeare by the expressing of them in these termes, touch not, taste not, handle not: which no doubt were imitations of legall rites and ceremonies; and so the argument of the Apostle in this verse is to bee con∣ceiued, as I haue propounded it. More specially wee haue laid before vs in this Verse; First, the Apostles reason to diswade the Colossians from submitting to the decrees and traditions of men (namely) this, that they were freed from them by Christ his death, laid downe in the proofe of it, that with Christ they were dead, and by death freed from them. Secondly, the inference on that reason, therefore you ought not to subiect your selues to them; deliuered by way of interrogation, why are yee burdened with them? amplified by exprobration of the absurdity of such subie∣ction, that it is all one as if they still liued in the world. (Why, as though yee liued in the world, are yee burdened with traditions?) (Dead in Christ) To bee dead with Christ is to haue fellowship with him in his death;Interpreta∣tion. euen to die with him as the members of his bodie: (from the ordinances of the world) By ordinances of the world wee are to vnderstand, Legall Ceremonies, the originall words are the same with those, Verse 8. and so to be vnderstood. Now, whereas the Apostle saith, Dead from the ordinances of the world, it is not an vsuall manner of speaking in the Scripture, to say, Dead from, but rather, dead to this, or that, as dead to the Law, dead to sinne; and therefore the meaning is, as if the A∣postle had said; Dead, and by death freed from the ordi∣nances of the world, (as though he liued in the world.) To liue in the world may betaken two waies. 1 Either to liue in the world in respect of bodily life.
2 Or to liue after the course of the world, as Ephes. 2.2. Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world. And in this latter sense we are to take these words (as though he liued in the world) (that is) as though ye were not dead with Christ, and by death freed from the orders of the world, but still liued after the course of the worlde (are yee burdened with traditions) In the ori∣ginall, wee haue but one word, it cannot bee so expressed in English, it signifieth thus much; Are ye held vnder the decrees of men, or such things as seeme good to men: so this translation (are yee burdened with traditions) may bee iustified, though the Papists carpe at it. This then is the meaning of the Apostle, in this verse. If yee as members of Christ be dead with him and be as free as dead men from the Ceremonies of the Law, why? as though yee still liued after the course of the world, are yee held vnder the decrees and traditions of men, which seeme to be deriued from the braine of men. Of the first part of this verse (namely the reason of the Apostle, If yee be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world; much might bee spoken, but wee haue handled the chiefe things thence offered heeretofore, as that there is so neere a vnion betweene Christ and his members, that when he died, they died with him, of that we spake verse 12. And also of the doctrine offered from those words, ordinances or rudiments of the world, wee spake verse 8. I will not now againe handle those points onely. One thing more we may gather from the reason of the Apostle. And for concluding the point, we are to mark, that the Apostle saith, If ye be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world, meaning, if yee bee freed from them, he puts dead from them, for freed from them; sig∣nifying indeed, that they were as free from them as dead
men that had nothing to doe with them. The point that hence I gather is this. That death is a freedom, death sets men at liberty from  the lawes and ordinances of men, yea from all hard tax∣ations, from bondage and seruitude in the world,Death sets men free frō the Lawes of men and from all hard taxa∣tions in the world. and from all miseries they are subiect to in this world, that which Iob saith of the seruant Iob 3.19. That death sets him free from his master, is true of all kind of outward seruitude, bondage, slauerie, or miserie that men vndergoe in this life whatsoeuer, death frees them from it; the afflictions are but for this life onely, Rom. 8.18. Death puts an ende to them; the malice of the Deuill, the rage of ty∣rants, and violence of bloudie persecutors can reach no further then this life: they can but kill the body, as our Sauiour saith, Matth. 10.28. and when that is done they must cease from their tyranny, therefore we are not to feare them. Our Sauiour himselfe makes this vse of it, feare not them which kill the body, and when they haue done that can go no further, but feare him which is able to destroy both bo∣dy and soule in hell.Wee are not to feare them only who can kill the body but him who can destroy both body and soule. Againe, is it so that death is freedome from all mise∣ries that men are subiect to in this world, then be not too much cast downe in any outward troubleWe are not to be two much cast downe in our outward troubles. or calamity that can befall thee, as sickenesse, pouerty, losses, painefull la∣bours,  &c. Thy life is but short, therefore that trouble cannot be endlesse, death shall put an end to it, onely let thy care and and endeauour be that thy death bee not the beginning of that misery that neuer shall haue end; many persons hauing no assurance of a better life after this life is ended, but onely out of their impatience in respect of a∣ches, and paines, and lingring diseases or other troubles which they endure, long for death, as Iob saith, Iob 3.21. and say sometimes, oh happy were I if I were dead, then should I bee free from my paine and trouble, as if death were an ende of all kinde of miserie, neuer re∣membring
that death in sin will not rid them from mise∣ry, but is the very gate through which they passe into the gulfe of endldsse woe, death indeed puts an end for a time to the aches and paines we endure in the body, yet that is but a thing common to vs with the dumbe beast, in that re∣spect the sore trauelled horse is happy when he dieth, but death in sinne is a passage of the soules of men from lesse misery to greater, therefore neuer thinke thy selfe happy if thou wert deliuered by death, from aches and paines which thou endurest in this life, vnles thou haue assurance of a better life after this life is ended, labour thou to be sure to die in the Lord, which thou shalt doe if thou liue in the Lord, or rather haue the Lord Iesus liuing in thee, Gal. 2.20 if thou liue by faith in the sonne of God, and repent of thy sins, and haue true peace of conscience as the earnest of thy saluation then indeed thy death shall put an end to all thy miseries, thou shalt rest from all thy labors, from all kinde of sorrow and suffring, yea, death shall giue thy soule an entrance to euerlasting ioy and glory, if thou hast this assu∣rance, thou lying vnder some greeuous affliction, thou mayst lawfully say with the Apostle, Phil. 1.23. I desire to be dissolued and to be with Christ. Come wee to the inference of the Apostle in the other part of this verse (why as though ye liued in the world are yee burdened with traditions) where first obserue we the man∣ner the Apostle vseth in bringing in of this conclusion▪ hee sayth not barely you are dead with Christ from the ordi∣nances of the world, and therefore ought not to submit your selues vnto them, but he brings in his conclusion by way of interrogation, why are ye burdned with traditions) which is very emphaticall and powerfull, and he amplifies it by laying before them how absurd a thing it were, if they should so do, that it were all one, as if they liued still in the world (why as thogh ye liued in the world are ye burdned with traditions) as if he had said, if such as liue in the world shoulde subiect themselues to those ordinances I would
make no great matter of it, but you Colossians who proue your selues to be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world, and not to liue after the course of the world, for shame doe not you suffer your selues to be subiect to the decrees and traditions of men. Hence wee may take out  this conclusion, that such as professe themselues to be dead with Christ, and taken out of the corrupt state of the world are by the remembrance of that profession to be kept from doing any thing contrary or vnbeseeming the same,The remem∣brace of our christian pro∣fession ought to keepe vs from doing any thing con¦trary or vnbe∣seeming the same. we find this as a reason of waight often vsed in the Scripture, either to perswade to some good thing, or to disswade from some euill, Gen. 13.8, Abraham vsed it as a special means to quiet matters betweene him and Lot, that howsoeuer the Canaa∣nites were at iar and discord one with another, yet it ought not to be so between them, because they were brethren & professed the same true faith and religion Mat. 6.32, After these things seeke the Gentils, 1. Cor. 6.1. the Apostle vpon this ground dares the Corinthians, dare any of you hauing busines against another be iudged vnder the vniust and not vnder the Saints, as if hee had sayd, do not you remember that you are Christians and professing the true faith of Christ, dare you then go to law one with another vnder vn∣iust and infidel iudges and not vnder the Saints? it is a monstrous shame for you so to do, by these testimonies we see we are to take aduantage of that profession we make, & by the remembrance of that to bee kept from doing any thing vnbeseeming.Vse True profes∣sors of religi∣on are to ga∣ther strength against temp∣tations to sin by remem∣bring that ho∣ly profession. Let all such as professe religion and the feare of God thinke on it, art thou being a professor of re∣ligion troubled and stirred vp by the Diuell and thine own corruption to couetousnesse, to rash anger, or to any other knowen sin? remember thy profession and learne to say, as good Nehemiah said, Neh 6.11. who when he was mo∣ued by a fals Prophet, to go into the temple to saue his life, sayd, should such a man as I flie; so say thou, should such a man or such a woman as I bee couetous or rashly angrie should I that professe my selfe to depend on Gods proui∣dence
and to seeke after other things euen things eternall and lasting for euer, greedily hunt after the things of this life? no, no, I will not doe it, it were a derogation to the glorie of my God, whom I professe to be my gratious fa∣ther; a dishonour to the profession I make, scandalous and offensiue to other weake professors: a meanes to keepe backe some not yet called a giuing aduantage to the obsti∣nate and an opening of the mouthes of th wicked A∣theists and enemies of the truth, euen to speake euill of the professours of the Gospell, therefore farre bee it from me I will not doe it, thus are we to reason and resolue with our selues, in consideration of our holie profession, not to doe anie thing contrarie or vnbeseeming the same. We are to marke further, that the Apostle saith, why, as though ye liued in the world (that is) as though yee liued after the course of this world, implying by that speech, that the Colossians did not or a least ought not to liue after the course the world. The point of instruction hence arising is, that though we liue in the world, yet we are not to liue after the course of the world,Though we liue in the world, yet we are not to liue after the course and fa∣shion of the world. the Lord will haue his children to liue in the worlde, and not to separate themselues from the worlde, but to liue as Lot did in Sodome, in the throng of this sin∣full world, according to the limits of their particular places and callings. And that for these reasons. First, that the gifts of grace that they haue receiued may be vsed for the good of others. Secondlie, that there may be a triall of our strength in re∣sisting the assaults of Satan in euill examples, for that is in∣deed true resistance of sinne, and victory ouer it is most victorious,Note. when conflicting with many occasions and al∣lurements to it, we striue against it, and ouercome it, & he is truelie good, who is good amongst them that are euill. For these causes will the Lord haue his children to liue among the wicked of the world: but to keep themselues vnspotted of the world or any corruption in the world,Rom. 12.2. fa∣shion
not your selues like vnto this world, Ephes. 5.11. haue no fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse, but euen reprooue them rather, Phil. 3.20. our conuersation must be in heauen, free from all dregs of all earthly cor∣ruption, many other places might bee brought to this purpose, but for the vse of the point. This meetes with that plea,  many vse in defence of their sinne which they are loth to forgo, oh say they many do it and why may not I doe it,It is a vaine plea, to say, many doe this or that and therefore why may not I doe it. if we liue in the world, we must do as other men doe, sweare with them that sweare, drinke with the drunkard, & be prophane with them that are pro∣phane, or else we shall be counted as no body in the world, is it so that thou wilt not be perswaded, that this is thy duty, that though thou liue in the world, yet thou art not to liue after the course of the world, but thou must needes doe as other men doe, know then that thou shalt one day suffer together with others, the punishing hand of God shal one day ouertake both thee and them; yea let me tell thee more, there is no doubt but beastly drunkards, filthy adul∣terers, and the blasphemous wretches that are in the world, may remember some like to themselus on whom the Lord hath shewed his iudgements, they may call to mind some that together with their blasphemy haue belched out their last breath, or in a drunken fit haue belched out their owne soules, & that loathsome and incurable diseases haue been sent on the bodies of filthy adulterers, and yet wilt thou stil go on in the same course? know then that thy punishment shall be greater then theirs, thou hauing such examples be∣fore thee, and yet wilt not be moued by them to breake off thy sins by repentance, thy punishment shall one day farre exceed theirs. He that slayeth Kaine, saith the Lord,Gen. 4.15. shall be punished seauen fold. Kaine was a murderer, and the Lords hand was vpon him for his sin, and made him an example, he set a mark on him; & if any should be so bold as to com∣mit the same sin, hauing him marked before him, & to mur∣der him, his punishment should be seuen fold, so certainly if
thou haue an example of Gods iudgement before thee, & thou canst remember the Lords hand hath beene in fear∣full manner, vpon one like to thy selfe, and yet thou wilt still goe on in the same sinne, know that one day thy iudg∣ment shall be farre greater then his. Obserue yet further this inference of the Apostle toge∣ther with his amplification of it, he sayth why, as though yee liued in the worlde, are yee helde vnder the decrees of men (that is) why, as though yee were not dead with Christ but still liued in the world, are you subiect to mens decrees: Hence we are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That such as suffer themselues to be held vnder decrees that either are or seeme to bee deriued from the ceremo∣niall law and to bee bound in conscience vnto them carry themselues as men that deny the death of Christ,Such as sub∣iect themselus to decrees that either are or seeme to be deriued from the ceremoni¦all law carry themselues as men that de∣ny the death of Christ. and as such as haue no fruite nor benefite, by his death, this is cleere from the text, and with this agrees that of the A∣postle, Galat. 5.2. if yee bee circumcised Christ shall pro∣fite you nothing, if ye subiect your selues to circumcision or any of the old legall ceremonies Christ shall profit you nothing, the reason is plaine. Christ by his comming and death put an end to all those ceremonies therefore still to retaine any of them, yea, any thing that is, or seemes thence to bee deriued as a thing necessarie to saluation,  is to make Christ vnprofitable; how then can the Papists iustifie their decrees of not tou∣ching,Many popish decrees eua∣cuate & make void the death of Christ. not tasting, of abstaining from some kinde of meates, and from marriage of not handling money and the like, besides the badge of Antichristian apostasie which the Apostle hath layd on them. 1. Tim. 4.3. how can they free those their decrees from beeing such as e∣uacuate and make voyde Christ his death?A popish ca∣uill. it will not serue their turne to say their decrees are not the same with the legall ceremonies, and that their Church de∣crees, not abstinence from this or that thing as vncleane
(though indeed they doe, for they place holinesse and part of Gods worship in such abstinence and so condemne that kind of meat at that time as vnclean by their prohibition) but they cannot so shift off the matter, by their decrees of abstinence from meat, and the like, being taken from the ceremoniall Law of Moses,  and vrged on the consci∣ence, as necessary to saluation, they do, as much as in them is nullifie and make voyd the death of Christ, and they that subiect themselues to such decrees, carry themselues as men that deny Christ his death, and thereby proue them∣selues to haue no part nor benefit by his death; yea, if any amongst vs superstitiously minded doe submit himselfe to any ordinance or decree of our Church with a minde and opinion of holinesse and seruice of God therein, for exam∣ple, if any haue this conceit, that by that tasting of flesh at times forbidden by our Church, he serues God, & is made more holy in the sight of God, let him know that such a subiection is a deniall of Christ his death, & a renouncing of the fruit and benefit of Christ his death. Come wee to the 21. verse, where our Apostle speakes in the person of false teachers, and in imitation of them sayth thus. VER. 21. Touch not, taste not, handle not. In this verse hee doth specifie their decrees and expresse them particularly in their owne words, as if hee had sayd, why are yee helde vnder the decrees of false teachers, as namely these, they say vnto you, Touch not, taste not, handle not,Interpre∣tation. some expound these words as spoken of diuers things as touch not a dead corps, taste not of this or that kinde of meate, handle not holy vessels, and the like, but I take it they may more fitly bee vnderstood as all spoken of the same thing (namely) of meates, Touch not, taste not, handle not, this or that kinde of meate, for that is more agreeable to the context and to the wordes of this verse, and that matter of meates did put the faithfull of those times both
teachers and others to much businesse and trouble both in regard of the zeale that some had by legall ceremonies, and in respect of continuall vse of meat and drinke (Touch not) the originall word translated (touch) signifies either to touch or to eate, yet but a little, and these wordes (touch not) may thus be vnderstood, eate not, no, not a little, or touch not with thy teeth, or chewe not with thy mouth (taste not) that is a further degree of prohibition, doe not so much as taste with thy mouth: then followes a third de∣gree yet higher (handle not) doe not lay thine hand on this or that kind of meat, thus then conceiue we these words. Chew not in thy mouth, taste not with thy tongue, nor lay thine hand, on this or that kinde of meat. Now heere first wee are to marke that the Apostle ha∣uing sayd in generall in the verse before, bee not burdened with traditions, be not held vnder the decrees of men, in this verse he subioynes their particular decrees of touching meates, and hee giues instance and example onely of them bee not burdened with traditions as (namely) touch not, taste not, handle not, this or that kinde of meate, no doubt hee might haue insisted in many other things, but he thought it most needfull to stand against their superstiti∣ous decrees concerning meats as most dangerous to the Colossians, and hence wee may gather this conclusion. That as Satan and his instruments do ensnare the soules of men in many outward things, so not with the least dan∣ger  in or about their meats and drinkes.Satan doth dangerously tempt and en∣snare the souls of men in re∣spect of meat and drinke. Satan the enemie of our saluation is euer tempting and that dangerously in respect of meate and drinke ei∣ther on the right hand or on the left, either to abstaine as did these false teachers, or else to exceede, hee be∣ganne this kinde of temptation betimes, our first Pa∣rents were noe sooner created and placed in Paradice but hee presently beganne to tempt them about meate, and from that time to this hee neuer resteth laying snares to entrappe vs, euen in, or about our meat and drinke, and he knowes this temptation to be of great force. Therefore
he laid it against him that was most strong thinking to preuaile but in vaine, euen against our Sauiour himselfe Mat. 4.3. And the reasons why Satans temptation in, or about meat and drinke is so dangerous, are these. First, it is a thing we vse and must vse daily, and if we want  it, without the speciall grace of God, we are readie to vse a∣ny vnlawful meanes to get it, as the saying is, hunger will breake stone wals, it wil make men wanting grace to break through the commandements of God, by lying, swearing, stealing, and what not, that they may be satisfied. Againe, if we haue it, we are not onely prone to abuse it  in a most high degree; witnes the practise of beastly drun∣kards; who, not onely glory in their strength to poure in strong drinke, but will bestow much cost on others, to make them of their own wretched condition, euen drunkē like themselues, that they may sport and laugh at them. And herein the deuil hath preuailed further then in ma∣ny other sins;Note. who will bestow cost on others to make them sin in any kind, only to make themselues meery? in∣deed for their profit or credit wicked men will hire others to lie, & to swere falsly for them, but for sport & meeriment only who will be at any great cost in making others to sin, except only in drunkenesse. This shewes plainely, that the deuils tempation, in, or about meat or drink, is exceeding powerful & dangerous, and that he many times preuaileth therin very far in bringing men to an high degree of sin. Our care then must be to take heed we bee not ouerta∣ken with sinne,  in things of necessary vse as our meat and drinke; wee are to watch ouer our hearts, and to haue a godly feare in our hearts, in the time of our eating and drinking,we are to watch ouer our harts that sinne do not creepe vpon vs in time of our eating & drinking. Saint Iude doth taxe some in his time for want of this, verse 12. They feast with you (saith hee) without feare, feeding themselues; and especially, we are to haue this feare in our hearts in the time of feasting, when wee come to a table furnished with store and variety of meats, it is the counsell of the wise man, Prou. 23.3. That at such
a time we be not desirous of the dainty meat, for it is de∣ceiuable. To feast together is not vnlawfull, holy Iob suffe∣red his children so to doe, but afterward he called them to¦gether and sanctified them, and offered burnt offerings for them, for Iob thought, Iob 1.5. it may be that my sonnes haue sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts, in time of their feastings. And this are we to haue a godly ielousie and suspition of our owne selues, that sinne do not intermingle it selfe with our plentifull eating and drinking, and that then our affections doe not settle and rest too much one the sweet∣nesse of our meates and drinks, & that we forget not God the giuer, that we forget not the hunger and thirst of our poore brethren, Amos 6.6. and that we exceed not mea∣sure in eating and drinking: and that our hearts may bee possessed with this godly feare and jelousie.Note. Let vs re∣member what a grieuous thing it is when our table is a snare to vs, it is one branch of that praier that was made against the malicious enemies of the Church, Psal. 69.22. Let their table be a snare before them: thus it shal be to vs vnlesse we watch ouer our hearts in our eating and drin∣king, euen our meats and drinkes shall bee snares vnto vs. Withall we are to remember that we abusing the creatures of God, our meates and drinkes, the Lord doth many times secretly turne them euen to the hurt of our bodies, those good gifts which he hath ordained for the preserua∣tion of nature; beeing abused, through the Lords iust iudgement, are sometimes turned to the choaking and o∣uerturning of nature in vs; for it is iust with the Lord, wherein men sinne, therein for the most part to punish them; it therefore standeth vs in hand, if we respect the good of our owne soules or bodies, not to let our hearts loose in time of eating and drinking, but to be wary and circumspect, euen in receiuing our ordinary diet, but spe∣cially when we come to a feast, take heed that then forget∣fulnesse of God, or our brethren, excesse, or any other sin,
doe not intermingle it selfe with our eating and drin∣king. In the next place, in that false teachers among the Colos∣sians were not content to say, touch not, or eate not, of this or that kinde of meat, but they proceeded further, to forbid the tasting of certaine meates:The mindes of superstiti∣ous persons are restles. I might shewe you how restlesse the mindes of superstitious persons are, they are neuer content with the number of their owne deuised orders & decrees. Thus it is at this day among the Papists, one order, one decree is euer and anon inuented among their Monkes, and others of that rable which they call re∣ligious, but I will not stand on that point. Obserue wee the manner these false teachers vsed in putting forth their decrees, they put them forth in the singular number, touch not, or thou shalt not touch, thou shalt not taste, thou shalt not handle, that they might reach euery parti∣cular, and in the negatiue, which is of more force then the affirmatiue, they would haue them binde as strictly as Gods commandements. Hence we are to note their curiosity,False teachers are very curi∣ous and strict in causing their follow∣ers to auoide the least touch of things they suppose to bee vncleane. I cannot proper∣ly call it care, but their curiosity and strictnesse in proui∣ding that their should be no medling at al with meats, they supposed vncleane, that men should not touch them, no not taste of them, nor handle them; and this strictnesse was not proper to those false teachers alone, but hath been found in all of like sort, in all ages and times, the Apostle saith Gal. 6.12. that false teachers were so earnest and for∣ward in vrging circumcision on the Galatians, that they constrained them to be circumcised. Now, this is not to be passed by without profit to our selues: let vs therefore thinke on it to this purpose,  are false teachers so strict in causing, if possibly they may,We are to bee careful, and indeed curi∣ous in auoi∣ding all man∣ner of sinne. their followers to take heed of the least touch, or least medling with that they fancy to be vncleane; Oh; then how much more ought we to be carefull, & if you will curious, in a∣uoiding that which is indeed vnclean (namely) al maner of
sinne: yea, we ought in this respect to be so strict, as wee are not to touch any meanes, or any occasion leading vnto it, not to come into the company of such as are notorious wicked persons, more then we must needs in respect of the bond of nature, of office, of place and calling, not careles∣lie to come into their company, for that is to touch pitch, and it cannot chuse but defile vs. Peter in bad company denyed his Master; and hyther too wee may truely apply that of the Apostle 2. Cor. 6.17. touch none vncleane thinges; and that also of Iude Vers. 23. hate euen the garment spotted by the flesh: it is too much boldnesse in some who causlessely sort themselues with any company. Reproofe of such as thinke they may with out danger meddle with sinnes.And againe, some thinke they may without danger, at∣tire themselues like wantons, garishly; and may safely vse filthy and rotten speach at their pleasure, these they thinke are things not to bee stood on, and it is too much strict∣nesse to make conscience of them; but what saith the A∣postle, Ephes. 5.3. Fornication, and all vncleanesse, or co∣uetousnesse, let it not bee once named among you as it becommeth Saints; the Apostle would haue vs not to touch them with the typpe of our tongues. And there is reason for it,Note. it is a dangerous thing but to put on the counterfet of sinne, and for a man to bee but personatus peccator, to play the part of a sinner, as many foolish thinke; oh they will but dally with sinne, they wil but make themselues meery with a few ribauld termes, they will but touch sinne and put it from them, before they enter into the grosse practise of it, such persons as thus speake, or thus thinke, they are not acquainted with the corruption of their their own nature; they must learne to know that if sinne be sweet in their mouthes, and they de∣light to speake of it, certainely they will fauour it, and not forsake it till it turne to poyson in their bowels as Zophar saith Iob 20.12. Yea let them know they might as safely drinke vp strong poison and prescribe it a measure how farre it shall worke, for why? whereas they say or thinke
they will but sport themselues with sinne for a time,Sinne makes sure worke. and they will leaue it when they please; they must know that sinne makes sure worke hauing once seazed on them, it will hold them and that fast by the heart, yea their will it selfe is kept in hold and bondage and cannot bee clean∣sed till the Lord with his powerfull hand of grace doe de∣liuer it. Therefore fancy not to thy selfe, thou wilt but touch sinne for a time and then leaue it; No, no, learne to feare alwaies, bee afraid to come neere the borders of sinne, flie from it as thou wouldest from one sicke of the plague, whose breth thou wilt auoid, and the needlesse touching of any thing about him: bee not thou like the foole spo∣ken of, Prou. 14.16. Who rageth and is carelesse, who hath neither quicke sight to espie and foresee the occasi∣ons of sinne, nor care to shunne them, but goes on securely till some heauy iudgement ouertake him. VER. 22. Which all perish with the vsing, and are after the commandements and doctrine of men. In this Verse our Apostle brings two other arguments to disswade the Colossians from suffering themselues to be held vnder the decrees of men, of not touching, tasting, or handling this or that kinde of meate. The first, is from the condition of things, about which their decrees were in these words, (which all perish with the vsing) it may thus bee conceiued, such decrees as are of transitory things, the obseruation whereof hath no force nor strength to saluation and to life euerlasting, you are not to place holinesse and religion in them, but such are these decrees (touch not, taste not, handle not) and that is laid downe in the proofe of it, these are of things vani∣shing and passing away with the vsing of them, they en∣dure no longer, therefore you are not to place holinesse and religion in them.
The second argument is from the efficient cause of such decrees of men, that they were the commandements of men, and therefore they should not suffer themselues to be held vnder them. Interpreta∣tion.Of these in order. (Which all perish with the vsing) (that is) all which touching, tasting, and handling, together with the things to be touched, tasted, and handled, (perish with the vsing) the words signifie (are to corruption in the vse) the meaning is, are consumed in the vse, or are cor∣ruptible, and endure no longer then the very vse of them and both they and the vse of them doe vanish and passe a∣way with the time. Now, heere first the argument of the Apostle is to bee considered, in that he reasoneth thus; that the decrees of false teachers were of things perishing, and passing away with the vse of them, and therefore the Colossians ought not to place holinesse in them. Hence we are giuen to vn∣derstand thus much. That holinesse, religion, and the worship of God, consi∣steth not in vanishing things, it is not in things that passe a∣way with the vsing, and are onely appointed for our vse in this mortall life, as in meate and drinke, in daies in ap∣parell, and the like; these things of themselues make vs not more or lesse holy in the sight of God.Transitory things of this life doe not of themselues make vs more or lesse holy in Gods sight. I say, these things of themselues; wee may sinne, and that grieuous∣lie, in the vse of such things, and we may please God in the moderate and sober vse of them; but the things them∣selues, or actions about them considered by themselues, doe not make vs more or lesse holy. 1. Cor. 8 8. The A∣postle saith plainely, meate maketh not vs acceptable to God; for, neither if we eate, haue we the more, neither if we eate not haue we the lesse. The meaning is, more or lesse piety and religion, or are more or lesse pleasing to God, Rom. 14.17. The Apostle saith, the kingdome of God is not meate nor drinke (that is) religion and the power of it, standeth not in meate and drinke, but in
righteousnesse, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost. The reason is this, because godlinesse and religion as the Apostle saith, 1. Tim. 4.8. is profitable, it is of vse to all things hauing the promise, both of this life, and of that which is to come. Now meate and drinke and other outward things,  bee∣ing appointed onely for the vse and necessity of the body, they reach no further then this life, the vertue and effica∣cie of them doth not extend it selfe any further then to this present life; therefore godlinesse and religion cannot stand in them. It will be said,  doth not religion and the worship of God consist in any vanishing thing, in any thing that passeth away with the vsing; what say you then to the washing of water in Baptisme, and to eating and drinking at the Lords Table, doe not these things passe away with the time? I answer,  indeed the outward and bodilie actions are ended with the time of vsing, but the force and efficacy of these actions reacheth further; euen to signifie and seale vp grace to life euerlasting, they are ordained of God to signifie & seale vp grace to life eternal and are auailable to that purpose and therfore not to bee esteemed as things vanishing and passing away with the vse of them. But for the point in hand, I hope it is cleare, that Religion and the worship of God consisteth not in things vanishing and passing away with the time. And first, this meets with that error of the Papists, who place a principall part of Gods worship in the vse of out∣ward  vanishing things,Confutation of the Papists placing a chiefe part of Gods wor∣ship in the vse of outward things. they hold it a great part of holines & religion, to weare this or that kind of habit, to abstaine from one kind of meat and to eat another; it is a strange thing that men should be so simple, especially, that men of vnderstanding should be so ouerseen, as to perswade them∣selues that the very vsing of this or that outward thing, the abstaining from this or that kind of meate, should make
any thing to eternall life, that a thing corruprible in it selfe and consumed in the vse, and hauing no further vse, but naturall, for the present necessitie of the body should any thing auaile to life euerlasting. This is a strange thing but that by the iust iudgement of God they are giuen ouer to themselues. For the vsc of the point to our selues, is it so that religi∣on standeth not in vanishing things,We must look that our reli∣gion bee not in vanishing things. in such things as passe away with the vsing of them: then, I beseech you, let vs eue∣ry one looke that our religion (for we will be held such as haue religion, and such as worship God in spirit and truth) Let vs therefore looke, that our religion be not in things vanishing, transitorie, and passing away with the time; there is no doubt, but most of vs, if not all of vs, can discerne the groffenesse of Poperie, and cry shame on it, in placing religion in not touching, not tasting, or not hand∣ling this or that kind of outward thing; yet we our selues many of vs haue no other religion, but euen that which is found in vanishing things, in things passing away together with the time: for what else is our formall hearing of the word, our receiuing of the Sacraments of custome, and for fastiion, our praiers vttered with the mouth, when our hearts are wandring farre from God; yea the iudgements of God being vpon vs in plague, vnseasonable weather, and such like. Will not we sometimes confesse, and say, these things are come on vs for our sinnes, and yet what is such confession in the most of vs, but a vanishing thing, a fleting motion, euen a thing passing away with our breath, and the speaking of it, we haue not any ttue sense and fee∣ling of our sinnes, neither will we (as we ought) come to any particular sinne of our owne confessing, that to haue deserued such a iudgement; what then is this but to place our religion in things vanishing, and passing away with the time: indeed I confesse that hearing the word and re∣ceiuing the Sacraments are not vanishing things in them∣selues, they haue vse both in good and bad, in the one sort
to life and saluation, in the other to iudgement and con∣demnation, but beeing formally vsed they are vanishing things, in respect of theit sauing and comfortable vse, they passe away with the time, in respect of that vse we are not bettered by them, wee haue no profit by them to life and saluation; and if we place our religion in a formall hearing of the word or receiuing the sacraments, and thinke wee are religious in so doing, surely, our religion is not sound, it is but hypocrisie, let vs take knowledge of it, and let vs not thinke it sufficient, if we come to the Church, heare the word, and receiue the Sacraments, vnlesse we finde these exercises of holinesse, and of the worship of God, power∣full in working grace in vs, and of comfortable vse to our owne saluation, yea, let vs euer looke that our religion bee found in things permanent, and such as haue vse to life e∣uerlasting, as in faith, hope, loue to God and men, humili∣ty, patience, and in workes of mercy; for these indeed passe not away with the vsing, but endure to life euerlasting, though the action of them bee transient, and passe away with the time, and yet being done by a true beleeuer, one that is in Christ, the good of it remaines after the action, yea, the good of it shall follow him when all things in the world forsake him, for they leaue him at the graue, but that shall follow him to heauen, as saith the holy Ghost, & that is a notable inducement to stir vs vp to the doing of good, and to the practise of religion in this manner. In the next place, from the matter of this reason of the Apostle, in that hee saith (which all perish with the vsing meaning meats forbidden by the Law of Moses, and the touching, tasting & handling of them; we may easily see this conclusion laid before vs; that food of the body, cor∣porall meat and drinke, and the actions about them in the vse of them, namely eating and drinking passe away with the time, and reach no further then the time of this life, I neede not spend much time in proouing this poynt, it will easilie be confessed to be a truth, Matth. 15.17. our
Sauiour hath set it downe as a generall conclusion that whatsoeuer entreth into the mouth goeth into the bellie, and is cast into the draught, it perisheth and is consumed, 1. Cor. 6.13. the Apostle sayth, meates are ordained for the bellie, and the bellie for meates, but God shall destroy both it and them (to wit in respect of eating and drinking, and shall cause these actions to cease, and the vse the bellie hath in time of this life, for in the life to come there shall be no vse of meate or drinke, we shall be as the Angels of God in Heauen; what is our vse of this point? Surely that which our Sauiour hath taught vs Ioh. 6.27. That we labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meate that endureth to euerlasting life,We are not to labour for the meat that pe∣risheth but for that which endureth to life euerlasting a duty wherein most of vs are much wanting, wee labour and toile, and spend the strength of our bodies in seeking onelie after bodilie foode, and haue little or no care to seeke after the foode that endureth to eternall life; yea, manie are so ea∣ger in seeking after the foode of their bodies that they will haue it though it be with the losse of Gods fauor, and with the breach of a good conscience, witnesse that buying of trifles, peares and apples, and such like on the Sabboth day, this argues wee care not for any other thing, but that wee may haue to fill our bellies, let as many as are thus minded, whose bellie is their God, Phillip. 3.19. let them know that this sinne is highly displeasing to God, yea such a sinne as brings downe Gods curse on all that they haue in speciall manner, for so the Lord hath threatned Ierem. 17, 27. if yee will not heare mee to sanctifie the Sabboth day, &c. Let vs then know that wee are no gainers by breaking the Sabboth, wee thinke we get much by it, but the Lord will either consume our goods with fire or send a curse that like an vnquenchable fire shall deuour all that wee haue; Let vs then learne to keepe the Lords Sabboth holie, and to bestow it in holie exercises, and on that day especially to labour and seeke after that meat that endureth to life euerlasting, this is that one thing abfolutelie needefull
spoken of, Luke the 10. and 24. verses, Maries parte, though the entertainement of Christ was as necessarie as anie outward businesse, yet not necessarie in respect of this one thing for without this a man cannot bee sa∣ued,Note. which hee may without any thinge else hauing this. Come we now to the arguments of the Apostle being three in number, by which hee diswades the Colossians from submitting themselues to the decrees of false teachers in the words following (and are after the commandements and doctrines of men.) The first argument is from the efficient cause of these decrees (namely) men, that they were the fruite of mens braines, and therefore they ought not to place religion in the obseruation of them; now touching this argument, a doubt must be remooued before we come to the words of it (namelie) this, it may seeme by the argument,A doubt pro∣pounded. that the tarditions and decrees of men before spoken of verse the 20. were such as were meerelie inuented and deuised by the braine of men, and not (as we said) such as were deri∣ued from the ceremoniall Law of Moses, for then they should not be said to bee commandements and doctrines of men. For remoouall of this scruple wee must call to minde that which wee haue often heard that the rites and cere∣monies of the Law,  were to endure but for a time (name∣lie) for the time of the old Testament, till the comming and death of Christ, he being come in the flesh, their time was out in regard of the obseruation of them: therefore to deliuer things deriued from thence as necessary now to be obserued, is no precept of God but of man, though be∣fore the comming of Christ they were things commanded by God himselfe, yet now beeing abrogated to deriue anie thing from thence as necessarie to be obserued may be truelie said to be no precept of God, but of men; we may easilie conceiue this by the like, it is Gods Law that a wo∣man
should bee bound to her husband so long as he liues and he being dead then to bee free from him, so saith the Apostle, Rom. 7.2. Now then if men by their comman∣dements binde her to him after he is dead, and decree that she is still bound to him, and that it is vnlawfull for her to take another man to her husband, surely, that is not Gods Law, but a commandement and decree of men, so is it in this case, the people of God being bound to the things pre∣scribed in the Law of Moses, but for a time, if men decree that they are still bound to them as before, that time being expired, that is not Gods commandement, but the commandement and doctrine of men: and so this argu∣ment makes nothing against my former exposition, that by traditions we are to vnderstand decrees of men deriued from the ceremoniall Law of Moses, the words of this ar∣gument haue no difficulty in them, they are to be concei∣ued according to the proper signification of them, and the meaning of the Apostle in them is. That the decrees of men of not touching, not tasting, not handling, though they seemed to be decrees deriued from the ceremoniall Law of Moses, yet indeed they were only the commandements and teachings of men, and had no ground nor warrant from the word of God. We are in the first place to consider the argument it selfe in that the Apostle reasoneth thus, that the Colossians should not be held vnder those decrees of false teachers, of not touching, not tasting, not handling, as things of ne∣cessary observation vnto their saluation, because they were precepts and commandements of men, hauing no ground in the word of God; we are plainely taught thus much. That men can giue no precepts nor rules without war∣rant from the worde of God of necessarie obseruation to life euerlasting: rules giuen by men not grounded on Gods worde in case of religion, in matters of faith and manners are not of any moment, or of any necessity, we are not necessarily bound to the obseruation of them
as things needfull to life and saluation. The reasons of this are manifest. First, mans eye is not onely dimme or bleared, but starke blinde in heauenly things; therefore men can giue no direction for the way to life eternall. Secondly, the written word of God containes all things needfull to be knowen, beleeued or practised, and is suffi∣ciently able to make wise to saluation. 2. Tim. 3.15. Ther∣fore other rules besides that are needlesse, and if any be gi∣uen as needfull to saluation, we are not bound to obserue them. This I note in a word, to let vs see what we are,  to deeme of the vnwritten traditions of the Papists,The obserua∣tion of popish vnwritten traditions is dangerous & damnable. of their rules of abstinence from meat and drink, marriage and the like, which they vrge on men as things of necessary obser∣uation, and say the breach of them is a damnable and a deadly sin, wee are to know there is no necessity in the ob∣seruation of them, but rather indeede the obseruation of such decrees and precepts is dangerous, yea, it is damnable & deadly to obserue them as the Papists would haue men obserue them with opinion of necessity, and of merit, and as a part of holines and religion. Why but say they did not the Apostles, impose it as a necessary law and decree on the Gentiles conuerted,Act. 15.28.29 that they should abstain from things offred to idols, and bloud, and that that is strangled,  and from fornication, they say it seemed good to the holy Ghost and to vs, to lay no more burthen vpon you then these necessary things, the things there spoken of, some of them beeing ceremoniall were abrogated by the death of Christ, and yet they cal them necessarie things, they hauing decreed the obseruation of them. They cal them necessary, not because they were by their decree in that manner necessary as they were vnder the Law, but in respect of the edification of the weake,  for cha∣rity did require that the Gentiles conuerted should not vse their liberty in eating bloud and strangled amonge their weake brethren the Iewes, and thereby cause them to
stumble and to bee offended: but rather it was necessary that they should abstaine from that liberty, for the edifica∣tion of their brethren, and that is the meaning of the Apo∣stles in saying (these necessary things) and so the Papists haue heereby no aduantage for maintaining any necessi∣ty in their rules and decrees, not warranted by the word of God. Obserue we further that the Apostle in propounding this argument saith not onely after the commandements but addes to that (and doctrines of men) no doubt of purpose to auoyd an exception that the Colossians might iustly make, for if he had said onely after the commandements of men, they might haue sayd indeed these decrees of not touching, not tasting, not handling, are the commande∣ments of men, but yet it may bee they are the doctrines of God, they are commanded by men we confesse, but hap∣pily taught of God, now to take away all occasion of such exception, the Apostle saith, they were both the comman∣dements and doctrines of men. Hence we are put in minde of a difference of mens com∣mandements.Some com∣mandements of men are al∣so mens do∣ctrines and not to bee o∣beyed; other commande∣ments of men there bee which are also taught of God and to them obedience is due. Some are the cōmandements of men, & are also the doctrins of men (as were these decrees of false tea∣chers) and not taught of God at all in his word, either ex∣pressely or by necessary consequent, and these we are to re∣nounce, and not to yeeld obedience vnto. Other com∣mandements of men, there bee which are also taught of God, and to them we are to yeeld obedience, for exam∣ple, it is the commandement of man, that we assemble our selues publikely to heare the word, and this also is a thing commanded of God, and wee are bound to submit our selues to this commandement of man, and if we do not the Magistrate may lawfully compell vs, as it is sayd of good King Iosiah, 2. Chro. 34.32. he caused all that were found in Ierusalem, and Beniamin euen all his subiects to stand to the couenant he had made, yea, ver. 33. it is sayd, he com∣pelled all that were found in Israel to serue the Lord his
God:  And this meetes with that cauill of the Brownists a∣gainst the constitution and planting of our Church in this land.Confutation of the Brow∣nists touching the constituti∣on and plan∣ting of our Church in England. They say wee haue no Church truely planted, and why so? because say they, your Church was gathered only by the commandement of the Magistrate, after Poperie was put downe men were compelled by the Magistrate to make profession of the faith, and their profession was not voluntary. Answ.  It is a meer vntruth, to say that the true members of the Church in this land were gathered by the comman∣dement of the Magistrate, and compelled to make true profession of the faith, the Magistrate neuer tooke on him that power to compel men to beleeue or to make true pro∣fession of the faith that was wroght by the Spirit of Christ working by the word, indeed the Magistrate did only that he might lawfully do, yea, that which he was commanded to doe, that is, command the word publikely to bee prea∣ched, and men to assemble themselues to the hearing of it, which was a meanes to make men of vnwilling to become willing to beleeue and to professe the faith; the word prea∣ched, was that which from time to time wrought faith in the hearts of true beleeuers: therefore our Church in this land is truly gathered and planted, say the Brownists what they can to the contrary. Come we to verse 23. VER. 23. Which things haue indeed a shew of wisedome, in voluntarie religion, and humblenesse of mind and in not sparing the body, neither haue they it in any estimation to satisfie the flesh. In this verse the Apostle doth preuent & answer an ob∣iection  that some might make in defence of the decrees heere spoken against, for happilie some might saie that the decrees before spoken against by the Apostle seemed to be very wise and worthie decrees, and therefor not to bee so lightly regarded as the Apostle would haue them.
To this hee answers. First, by way of a generall con∣cession, that indeede they had a shew of wisedome. And then hee doth expresse in particular wherein that shew of wisedome consisted (namely) in three things. In volunta∣ry religion, in humbling of minde, and in not sparing the body. In the last words of the verse he answers directly to the obiection, and remoues it by force of reason: what his ar∣gument is I will lay foorth when I come to the words. Interpre∣tation.Let vs now speake something of the general concession in the first words (which things haue indeede a shew of wis∣dome) that is, which decrees haue indeede [1] certainely and truly (a shew of wisdome) to omit other acceptions of the word (shew) it heare signifies an appearance or colour of wisdome opposed to the truth of wisdome, and so the meaning of the Apostle is this. Which decrees haue certainly an appearance of wis∣dome, they seeme indeede to be wise and to be worthy decrees. We are here to marke that the Apostle saith the decrees of false teachers being as he said the commandements and doctrines of men, hauing no ground in the word of God, yet they had a shew of wisdome: hence then we may easily take vp this conclusion. That things that haue no ground in the word of God,  yea things contrary to the word may haue a shew of wis∣dome,Things not grounded on the word of God, yea, things contra∣ry vnto it, may carry a shew of holy wise∣dome. yea of holy and religious wisdome 1. Sam 15.3. we find that when Saul had an expresse commandement of God to smite Amalek and all that pertained vnto them, and haue no compassion on them, but to slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, both oxe and sheepe, both camell and asse, it seemed rather wisdome to do the contrary, euen to spare of the best of the sheepe and oxen, yea godly and religious wisdome that he might haue wherewith to offer sacrifice. This I might further shew by many particulars: and for the ground of this, it is the sub∣tilty
of Satan as by many meanes to draw to errour, so by this as not of the least force, euen by deluding of the mind and iudgment by making that seeme wisdome and good∣nesse, which indeede is full of folly and sinne. Our vse  of this point, is this, we are to take heede wee be not deceiued, and by the shew of wisdome bee brought to doe that which is contrary to the wil and word of God;Wee are to take heed that a shew of wis∣dome deceiue vs not, and make vs doe things con∣trary to the word of God some take liberty to sinne vpon this ground, oh, say they, many wise men doe this or that, and why may not wee al∣so doe it; and beeing reprooued for doing so, they will not sticke to say to the repoouer, as wise men as your selfe doe thus; it is indeed a plausible and powerfull argument yea it is more plausible and powerfull to say, many aunci∣ent wise men doe thus, therefore why may not I doe it, then to say many doe it, and therefore I may doe it. This latter is the argument of such as haue no feare of God be∣fore their eies, but the other is the argument of such as seeme to haue some religion in them: yea,Note the Deuill knowes the force of this argument, and therefore we find which is worthy obseruation, Act. 13.50. That hee stird vp certaine deuout and honourable women, and the chiefe men of the Citie, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts that others seeing such wise, graue, and deuout persons carried against them, they might by their example bee more encouraged to doe the like, and so giue a greater blow to the cause of God; I say therefore it is a plausible and powerfvll argument, to say many wise men doe so, therefore why may not I do it. But let vs take heede we be not led by the example of any, be they neuer so wise, to breake the Sabbath, to vse gaming, swearing, this or that foolish fashion in attire, or a∣ny other thing that the word of God doth not allow. And let vs know that though men doing these things be verie wise yet that is no part of their wisdome to do so, and why then should we follow them in that in which they are not wise.
And remember that their practise may lead thee to do as they doe, but it cannot preserue either them or thee from the reward of that sinne; therefore looke not who they be that doe this or that, but what warrant they haue for the doing of it, and how well they are like to speede for their doing, be not carried away with a shew of wisdome to doe any thing contrarie to the wisdome and will of God reuealed in his word, let that be thy guide and di∣rection in all things. Come we to the particulars wherin this appearance of wisedome consisteth, expresly set downe by the Apostle in the words following, (namely) Voluntary religion and humblenesse of minde, and in not sparing the body: the decrees of false teachers before spoken of, seemed to bee wise and excellent, in that in the practise of them there was volun∣tarie religion, and humblenesse of minde, and not sparing the body. Interpreta∣tion.(In voluntary religion) by voluntary religion, wee are to vnderstand such religion, and such worship of God, as is not willed and commanded by God in his word, but is from the will of man, and may bee called will worship, or indeed superstition, that is, as that word (superstition) doth signifie, supra statutum, more then is appointed by God in his word, when men doe that which they are not bound to by Gods commandement; and thinke that in so doing they worship God, that is, voluntarie religion (& humblenes of mind.) By (humblenes of mind) in this plaec is meant sub∣mission, & stooping downe lower then Gods commande∣ment, euen a subiection to the commandements and de∣crees of men. (and in not sparing the body) that is in one word, in hard vsage of the body, in rigorous and seuere dealing with the body, in macerating, vexing, and affli∣cting of the body, by withholding from it necessary suste∣nance, and conuenient regard. Thus then conceiue we these words as if the Apostle had said, those decrees of not touching, nor tasting, nor
handling, seeme to be wise and of great worth, in that in the practise of them, men giue free will worship to God, and doe that which they are not bound to doe, yea, more then God hath commanded them to doe, and they stoope lower then the Commandements of God, & in humility yeelde obedience and subiection to the commande∣ments of men, and they sticke not, euen to macerate, vex, and afflict, and to deale hardly with their owne bo∣dies. Now heerein the first place, in that the Apostle doth grant, that a shewe of wisedome consisted in voluntary religion, and that the decrees of men seemed to bee wise and worthy decrees, for that in the practise of them there was voluntarie religion. We may plainely see this conclusion laid before vs, that  will-worship carries with it a shew of wisdome,Will-worship carries a shew of wisdome. such wor∣ship, and seruice of God, as is not willed by God, but is wholly from the will of man, seemes to be wise and wor∣thy seruice, and men seeme to bee wise in offering to God voluntarie worship and seruice: thus we read, 1. Sam. 13.11.12. That when Saul had rashly and hastely presumed to offer a burnt offering which was more then hee ought to haue done; yet it seemed to him he had done wisely, and a good peece of seruice to God; yea, hee went about to perswade Samuel that he had done very well and wisely, saith he, I saw the people were scattred from me, and thou camest not within the daies appointed, and therefore I said, the Philistims will come vpon vs, and wee shall bee forced to ioine battell with our enemies, and haue not made supplication vnto the Lord; I was bold therefore, and offered a burnt offering: I was bold therefore, saith Saul, as if he had said, it was indeed more then I ought to haue done, I was bold to doe it, I did it of mine heade and of mine owne voluntary minde I offered a burnt offe∣ring, but I thinke in so doing I did well and wisely, I had great reason for it, this no doubt was the drift of Sauls
speach: and thus doth will-worship such seruice of God as men fancie to bee good, many times carrie before it  shew of wisdome, and reason; yea, as one saith well, ma∣ny points of superstition, haue so much shew of reason for them, that without Gods commandement to the contra∣rie, a wise man might thinke them verie fit meanes of Gods worship, and meritorious; how then may we profit by the knowledge of this point? Surely thus. First, it may teach vs not to stand amazed, nor to won∣der at it, that men learned and wise, are (as it were) wed∣ded to superstition.It ought not to trouble vs that men lear∣ned and vvise are many times vvedded to superstitiō. The learned among the Papists, doe exceedingly dote vpon their deuised worship, and their workes as they call them of (supererrogation) works not commanded, but ouer and aboue the commandement, as high and excellent seruices of God, and such as merit greater glory in heauen, they plead for them, and do won∣derfully please themselues in them; we are not to maruel at it, for therein they seeme to be wise; yea, therein they perswade themselues, they goe beyond others in pro∣foundnesse of wisdome. Againe, is it so that will-worship such as is not willed by God,We must take heed that vvee leane not too much to hu∣mane vvisdom and reason, in Gods vvor∣ship & seruice but is meerely from the will of man, doth carrie be∣fore it such a shew of wisdome and reason: let vs then take heede, we leane not to much to humane wisdome and reason, in the worship and seruice of God, if we doe, wee are in danger to bee carried away to superstition, and to serue God not according to his will, but after our own fancy. Reason will tell vs that any kinde of good seruice offe∣red to God out of our owne good meaning and deuotion, is pleasing to God, for so doe ignorant and superstitious persons plead for themselues, that they doe this or that out of a good minde and meaning. For example, they comming into a Church, not in time of publike worship, but at another time, they fall downe on their knees, and pray to the Lord, and they hold that
to be an high and holie seruice of God, and why? their owne reason tels them the place is appointed for the wor∣ship of God, and they are better put in minde of God in that place, and their praiers are more pleasing to God in that place then in another; and thus are men carried a∣way with a shew of reason, to doe that which the Lord ne∣uer required of them. But it will be said, may wee not pray when wee come into a Church, is it a thing vnlawfull? No, it is not, we may pray in all places,  according to the rule of the Apostle, 1. Tim. 2.8. I will therefore that the men pray euerie where: but to pray in a Church out of time of publike worship, with respect had to the place, with opinion that wee are more bound to pray in that place then in another, and with a conceit that God will sooner heare vs in that place then in another; that is grosse superstition, and vtterly vnlawfull; for the Lords worship is not bound to any one place, neither is God neerer, nor more ready to heare in a Church then in another place, out of the time of publike worship; as for that they say, the place doth stricke into them a reuerence of God and better put them in minde of God, that is iust as the Papists pleade for their images, and therein they notably discouer their owne corruption, in that they must needs haue such helps as God neuer appointed, to put them in minde of God, all these are but colourable shifts of mans owne rea∣son; and wee are to take heed, that we bee not led away by reason to offer that to the Lord as good seruice which he hath neuer commanded. Before we passe to the next thing,A doubt pro∣pounded. a doubt is to bee re∣mooued which happilie may rise in the mindes of some, I will briefelie propound, and resolue it, the doubt is this. It is a receiued, and sound truth, that all true beleeuers are a free and a voluntarie people that yeelde obedience, worshippe, and seruice to God voluntarilie, as if there
were no Law to compell them, they haue Christ liuing in them, and the spirit of life raigning in them, Rom. 8.2. and so their religion, and seruice of God is voluntarie, it may seeme then, that men may iustlie stand on voluntary religion as an excellent thing, and it is not to be taxed as hauing a bare shew of wisdome. It is true indeed the religion of true beleeuers is volun∣tary, but how? not in respect of the things done by them, because they doe things onely taken vp, and willed by themselues, to which they are not bound by Gods Law: No, no, they keepe themselues close to the com∣mandements of God, and their religion, and seruice of God is voluntarie in regard of the manner of seruing God, because they yeeld obedience, worshippe, and seruice to God willingly, and cheerefullie, they doe such good du∣ties, as God hath commanded them in his worship, and they doe them (though in weakenesse) yet with a free and a willing heart and minde, as Dauid bids Salomon, . Chr. 28.9. Thou Salomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy Father, and serue him with a perfect heart and a wil∣ling minde, thus is their religon voluntarie, and no other∣wise. (And humblenesse of minde) In that the Apostle saith further, that this shewe of wisdome consisted in humble∣nesse of minde, it may seeme strange, for humblenesse of minde is a speciall part of true, and not seeming, wis∣dome; it is pleasing to God, who resisteth the proud, as wee haue it, 1. Pet. 5.5. but wee must take the Apostles meaning, he vnderstanding by (humblenesse of minde) in this place, submission and subiection of minde, to the decrees of men, that haue no warrant in the word of God, such submission and subiection, hath onely an ap∣pearance of wisdome, and it is no true wisdome. Obserue wee from hence, (I will passe by things for∣merly spoken on these words, Verse 18.) obserue I say, that the false teachers of the apostles time, held it an high
point of wisdome for men to submit their mindes, to their deuised decrees, and not lift vp the least thought, or the least conceit of minde against them, and so the Doctrine hence is this. It is one note of false teachers, to vrge subiection, and  yeelding obedience to things deuised by themselues as a matter of wisdome,It is one note of false teach∣thers that they vrge obediēce and subiection to things of their ovvn de∣uising as a matter of vvis∣dome. that men may doe very well and wisely, if they submit their minds with reuerence to things taught by them, though they be not able to warrant them from the word of God; and thus much is implied in that expostulation of the Scribes and Pharises with Christ himselfe. Math. 15.2. Why doe thy Disciples transgresse the traditions of the Elders, for they wash not their hands when they eate bread: as if they had said, what reason haue thy Disciples so to doe: is it not foolishly done of them, were it not rather wisdome in them to obserue the traditions of our Elders, men that were renouned and in high esteeme for their grauitie and wisdome: that seemes to be the drift of their speech, thus reasoning the matter. (Why doe thy Disciples, &c. Now, this note cleaues fast to the teachers of the Ro∣mish  Church, they cannot possibly shift it from them;Popish teach∣ers discouered to be led vvith a spirit of error. for what is more common and frequent in their mouthes then the authority of the Church, that men are besotted, and possessed with foolish and hereticall pride in that they refuse to submit to the decrees of holy Churches, with∣out reasoning against them; yea, in that they yeeld not like reuerence to the decrees of their Prelates, that they doe to the word of God, for so hath that cursed Councell of Trent set downe with (anathema) vpon it; this plainely discouers them to be led with a spirit of er∣ror and of Antchiist. Why, but say they,  will you haue the sheepe to bee Iudges of their Pastors, and the people of their teachers? that were the most foolish disorder in the world. I answer them,  hearers ought to examine by the Scrip∣tures,
as the men of Berea did, Acts 17.11. Whether their teachers doctrine bee true, and to reiect whatsoeuer they finde not prooued by the Scriptures, and yet are not the sheepe thereeby made iudges of their Pastors, nor peo∣ple of their teachers, but the word of God is made iudge of euery doctrine, whether it be true or false; men indeed must with all reuerence, and humblenesse of minde heare their teachers; yea obey them, and be ordered by them, when they finde their doctrine to bee the doctrine of the holy Ghost, and not the inuention, or tradition of men. Luke 10.16. Hee that heareth you, heareth mee. And heerein are many amongst vs much wanting, and  come farre short of their dutie,Reproofe of such as refuse to submit their mindes and conscien∣ces to the plaine eui∣dence of Gods vvord. they will not in some things humble and submit their mindes to the plaine e∣uidence of the word, though they cannot denie but the doctrine taught is agreeable to the truth; yet, they har∣den their hearts against it, and they will not in humility yeeld obedience vnto it, though they must needes con∣fesse the thing reprooued to be a sinne, yet they will not subiect themselues to the reproofe, and suffer themselues to be wrought vpon and reformed: witnesse our conti∣nued prophanation of the Sabbath, in following after our sports and pleasures, and wanton dancing on that day, our continuall belching out blasphemous oathes, our drunkennesse, pride, and the like; yea, our willfull running farre and neere after a cunning man, or cunning woman, (as they are called) but indeed such as deale with sorcery and witchcraft: our seeking to them in time of sickenesse, or weakenesse of bodie, though this sinne haue beene often laid before vs, and surely heerein I am perswaded that some persons, goe not onelie a∣gainst the plaine euidence of the word, but against their owne consciences, and as it were, lay violent hands on their consciences, they will not suffer them to crie out a∣gainst them as they would, and that is a fearefull thing.
we know it is a greeuous thing for one to lay violent hands on his owne body, it makes vs tremble to thinke of it. Oh much more greeuous is it, as it were to strangle thine owne conscience, and for a time to stoppe the mouth-breath of that, for a little ease or health of thy body. Well let such as still wilfully runne into this sin, and into other sins, though they haue often heard to the contrary, let them but re∣member thus much, that the time shall come (vnlesse they repent) when euen the blinde and ignorant Papists, such ss are led hood-winckt in their superstition shall be iustified rather then they, though they haue a great measure of knowledge. For these ignorant Papists, (I warrant you) with great reuerence and deuotion, yeeld obedience to the deuised decrees and doctrines of their teachers, and yet these persons will not be brought to submit themselues to the truth, and to humble their mindes and consciences to the plaine euidence of the eternall trueth of God, ther∣fore certainely one day this sinne shall lie heauy on their consciences, and those blinde Papists shall rise vp in iudge∣ment against them, and condemne them. Come we to the third thing, wherein this shew of wise∣dome consisted (namely) (in not sparing the body) in hard vsage of the body; where first obserue for the grounding of the doctrine, that in the obseruation of those decrees of not touching, &c. there was hard vsage of the body, the A∣postle doth grant they seemed to bee wise, for that in the practise of them, there was hard vsage of the body: hence then in the first place we may easily gather thus much. That superstitious persons in their kind, are not formall and superficiall, but they are laborious and painfull in their  superstitious worship and seruice of God,Superstitious persons are not formall, but in their kinde they are laborious and painefull. they doe therein sometimes goe so farre, as that they deale hardly with their own bodies. The Prophet sayth of the wicked in his time, Ierem. 9.5. they took great pains to do wickedly, so indeed do superstitious persons many times to serue God superstitiously. Thus we read of Baals priests, 1. Kin. 18.28.
that they cut themselues with kniues and launcers till the bloud gushed out vpon them, Micah. 6.7. the hypocrite is brought in demanding, wherewithall shall I come before the Lord, &c. I would take any paines, yea, doe any thing euen that which is euen against nature, I would lay hands on mine owne childe, and offer my first borne childe to serue the Lord, and is it not thus among the Papists doe not many of them vndergoe much hardnesse, and endure great paines in their superstitions? as in wearing hairecloth going wooll-ward, bare footed, whipping themselues, and the like: we read of some Monkes called Flagetans, who went bare foote in linnen shirts, leauing an hole behinde on their backes, where they did daily whippe themseleues before the people till the bloud followed, and many hard vsages of the body we may read of, and happily some of vs may remember wee haue seene practised by superstitious persons. Now then for the vse of this point, let vs consider and thinke of these paines taken by men in by paths, and su¦perstitions, euen to stirre vppe our selues to greater dili∣gence and paines in the true worship of God.The paines taken by men in their super∣stitions ought to stir vs vp to greater dili∣gence and paines in the true vvorship of God. For why? shall superstitious persons be so painefull in their superstiti∣ons, and shall we take no paines in the true worshippe and seruice of God? (for example) shall a superstitious Papist rise earely, and breake his sleepe to performe his blind de∣uotion to go to his masse, and wilt thou on the Lords Sab∣both lie loitering and bathing thy selfe in thy bed? it is the fashion of the most, on other daies to rise earelie, but on the Lords day to take their ease, and to rise onelie to tricke and to trimme vp their bodies, but not to breake one mi∣nute of an houres sleepe to trimme, and prepare their soules to meete that Lord in the publicke assemblie; well let vs take knowledge of this to be a fault? Exod. 32.6. it is said when Aaron had yeelded to the people for the ma∣king of the golden calfe, the people did rise earelie in the morning to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings, let
then the diligence and paines of superstitious persons shame vs and stirre vs vppe to greater diligence in the true worshippe of God, if it doe not, certainlie it shall one daie iudge and condemne vs; and withall remember that it is a gratious thing to emploie our bodies and all the parts and members of them diligently and painefullie in Gods worshippe and seruice, to breake our sleepe, and with our eyes to preuent the morning light, as Dauid sayth, Psalm. 119.147.148. with our feete to trudge and runne after the preaching of the word with our eares to attend to it, striuing against dulnesse and drousinesse, no doubt pains taken in this kinde, will bee a comfort vnto vs when wee come to want the vse of our members, when our eyes waxe dimme, our eares heauie of hearing, and the strength of our whole bodies, through age or sickenesse is much decayed, yet without question it will be a comfort vnto vs, and cheere vp our hearts, if wee can remember they haue beene heeretofore painefully vsed in the true worship and seruice of God. Againe, let vs a little further consider the paines of su∣perstitious  persons on this manner:Superstitious persons dea∣ling hardly with their owne bodies to serue the Lord (as they doe imagine) ought to shame vs if we employ not our wealth and the things without our bodies to the honour and glory of God. shall superstitious per∣sons not spare their owne bodies, but deale hardly with them, therby seruing God as they do imagine, and shall we spare things that are without our bodies, I meane our wealth, and the outward good things of this life, and not employ them to the honour and glory of God, and wher∣in wee may bee sure to doe good seruice to God, bestow∣ing them liberally on the members of Christ to good v∣ses? let that bee farre from vs, how shall wee bee able to stand before the iudge of all the world, when hee shall say to vs, the Idolaters in their superstitions spared not their owne bodyes, and yet you in the way of truth, haue spared to honour mee with your goods? or how may wee thinke wee shall bee able to glorifie God by shedding of our bloud (if the Lord should cal vs vnto it, if we now be hardly drawen to do him seruice with our outward goods?
It may bee wee are painefull in prayer, in hearing the word, and in other spirituall exercises, (and yet the number of them is but fewe, who are painefull in these things) but when it comes to this, that we are to doe such duties as cannot be done without cost, and without charge and trouble. Oh howe many of vs shrinke and drawe backe, and striue to put others before them, farre vnlike to good King Dauid, who sayd: 2. Sam. 24 24. I will not offer a burnt offering vnto the Lord my God, of that which doth cost mee nothing: as if hee had sayd, if I serue God without cost and charge, how shall it appeare that I doe it in loue, in obedience, and in conscience towards God? Thus ought euery Christian to say with himselfe, if I serue God in prayer, and in spirituall exercises, and not in du∣ties of loue and mercy, euen to my cost and charge, how shall I manifest the sincerity of my faith, and of my loue towards God? I will therefore serue God, not onely in spi∣rituall dutie, but in such manner as shall bee costly and chargeable to mee, and howsoeuer the Papists doe this, thinking thereby to merit, yet let vs doe it respecting only Gods glory, for that indeed ought to be more precious & deare to vs then any merit, and if it be not, our hearts are not right within vs. Obserue wee further from these wordes, (not sparing the body) in that the Apostle sayth, that in hard vsage of the body, consisted a shew of wisedome,Rigorous and hard dealing with the body is but a vaine shew of wise∣dome. wee may easily ga∣ther that rigorous, inhumane, and hard dealing with the body, and vexing the body, is but a colour of wisedome its no part of true wisedome deriued from the wisedome of God, reuealed in his word, wee finde it as an approo∣ued rule of nature, and brought in by the Apostle himselfe to perswade men to loue their wiues, Ephes. 5.29. hee brings it as a constant rule neuer fayling, no man (sayth hee) euer yet hated his owne flesh: no man well in his wittes, not madde or drunke, foolish or desperate,
hated his owne body, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, euen nature it selfe teacheth thus much: let then our ad∣uersaries, the Papists boast and bragge of their outside of holinesse, standing in not sparing the body, in strict fasts, canonicall houres, hard fare, bad lodging, course apparell  &c,The Papists vainly boast of their holi∣nesse standing in hard dea∣ling with their bodies. as glorious and excellent things whereby indeede they insnare many a simple soule, but let vs know that these things are but outward shewes and semblances, there is no true wisedome in them, indeed we are not to pamper our bodies, it will soone bring the spirit vnder the flesh, which is a miserable thraldome, but wee must labour to keep vn∣der other corruption of our bodies and soules, that is, the beating of our bodies, the Apostle speakes of 1. Corinth.  7.29. and yet are wee not so to beate downe our bodies,We are not so to beat down our bodies as that we en∣feeble them and destroy nature and make them vnfit for good duties. withholding from them meat and drinke, & other things needefull, as that we enfeeble them, or destroy nature, and make them vnfit for any good duty, thats a greeuous sinne to deale so hardly with the body, and that for many rea∣sons: our bodies are the worke of Gods hand, as well as the soule, they are made to bee instruments of our soules for many good vses: euen to the promoting of Gods king∣dome, by speech, by administration and receiuing the sa∣craments, and helping of our brethren: they are the tem∣ples of the holy Ghost, members of Christ and shall bee glorified together with our soules, and therefore, howsoe∣uer we are to keep vnder the corruption both of body and soule, yet are we not by any meanes to destroy nature and the strength of our bodies, but wee are to hold an euen course betweene the excesse, and defect, and in one word, our rule in this case is this, our bodies are so to be vsed, in respect of meat and drinke, sleepe, recreation &c. that they may be fit instruments of our soules, for the exercise of e∣uery good duty, in the way of repentance, in Gods wor∣ship, and towards our brethren, and to this end wee may lawfully vse meanes of comfort, and refreshing, and of pre∣seruation of the strength and abilities of our bodies, as the
Apostle bids Timothy, 1. Tim. 5.23. drinke no longer wa∣ter; but vse alittle wine for thy stomackes sake, and thine owne infirmities. Come wee now to the last word of this verse, wherein the Apostle doth directly answer to the obiection, and re∣mooues by strength of reason. These words are diuersly read, some read thus (neither haue they it in any estimation to satisfie the flesh) with relation to the body, but the originall runnes thus word for word, (are not in any honour to the filling of the flesh) and so (as I take it) they may better be thus read, (but are of no value, saue to filling of the flesh, with respect to the decrees (of not touching, nor tasting, nor handling) and that they are of no honour, no estima∣tion or value, the reason is from the vse of them, they serue but to fill the flesh, by (flesh) we are here to vnderstand the lust and desire of corrupt nature, they are of no value, saue for the filling of the lust of corrupt nature. Where obserue wee that the Apostle hauing sayd, that in the practise of those decrees, of not touching, not ta∣sting, and not handling, there was hard vsage of the bo∣dy, yet heere hee reasons against them, as tending to the filling of the lust of the flesh; the poynt hence offered is this. Men may empty the flesh, and deny the body things that others grant to it,Men may deal hardly with the flesh, and yet therein be carnall and they may seem in their doctrine and practise to bee spirituall, and yet therein be carnall. and yet be fleshly, men may deale hardly with the flesh, and yet therein bee carnall, and the reason is plaine, from the words of the Apostle: they may in not sparing the body, satisfie the lust and desire of their owne sinnefull hearts, yea, the conclusion is generall, men may seeme in their doctrine, and practise to be spirituall, and yet therein be fleshly and carnall. 1. Ioh. 4.1. saith Iohn beleeue not euery spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God: he cals the doctrine of false teachers, (spirits) seeming indeed to be spirituall, and yet he saith ver. 5. they are of the world, and this indeed is the mystery of Antichri∣stianisme, thus is it in the whole body of popery, that reli∣gion
seemes to bee most spirituall, yet if wee looke into it, and haue our eyes opened to discerne aright, we shall see,  Popish religi∣on seeming most spirituall discouered to be most flesh∣ly & carnall. it is most fleshly and carnall it turnes spirituall seruice into corporall, standing in massing, pomp & musick to delight the outward sences it sayth, sinners, must haue Gods pardon, or they cannot be saued, but withall it teacheth they may haue it by the power of the keyes for mony, and that they may by merits of other men, and thogh in death men faile of repentance, yet for money they may be eased in Purgatory, with a thousand like things most pleasing to nature, no maruell then though men of their owne accord bee so strongly affected to popetie,Note. and once being taken in that snare, are so hardly drawen out of it, wee are not to maruell at it, and for our selues in that it is so, that where∣in men seeme to bee spirituall, they may notwithstanding bee carnall. Wee are to looke to our selues, and to our hearts in the  practise of holy duties,We must take heed we be not carnall in our practise of spirituall du∣tyes. for as the Apostle saith 1. Corinth. 13.3. a man may giue all his goods to the poore, yea giue his body to be burned, and yet want loue, so wee may do holy and good duties, and yet in doing them want loue to Gods glory, and feare to his name, and doe them to sa∣tisfie the lust of our owne carnall hearts, for pride, vaine∣glory or some other sinister and by-respect, we are there∣fore to examine our hearts in the dooing of good due∣tyes. One thing more obserue we, the Apostle we see reasons against the decrees of men, tending to the satisfying of the flesh, its then a fault to satisfie the lust and corrup∣tion  of the flesh,It is a fault to tisfie the lust & corruption of the flssh. the Apostle makes it an opposite mem∣ber to the putting on of Christ, Romans 13.14. put yee on the Lord Iesus Christ, and take no thought for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof: and is this a fault? then doubtlesse farre greater is the sinne of such as vse meanes to stirre vp the lust and corruption of their owne flesh, as drunkards vse to eat salt meates, to take Tobacco,
and vse other meanes to whet and sharpen their thirst,  vn∣cleane persons seeke after such meats,There sinne is exceeding great who vse meanes to stir vp the lust and corruption of their owne flesh. Note. as may enflame their lust, and make ready their hearts like an ouen, as the Pro∣phet speakes, Hos. 7 6. without question that is a most hor∣rible sinne, let such persons as deale thus, know, that in so doing they euen tempt the Diuell himselfe, they dispose their hearts to sinne, and discouer the corruption of them in the sight of the Diuell, and so euen tempt him to tempt them, and allure him as the theefe is allured by the booty to set vpon men, which is a fearfull thing, and such as must needs prouoke the Lord to wrath in fearefull manner, and bring downe his heauy iudgements on them that vse it, let such as are guilty of this sin thinke on it, and learne to reforme themselues.
THE THIRD CHAPTER. VERSE. 1. If yee then bee risen with Christ, seeke those things which are aboue, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. OVr Apostle hauing now absolued, and finished the first materiall part of his Epistle, and shewed in the first Chapter that the do∣ctrine deliuered to the (Colossi∣ans) was the truth and confirmed it, and perswaded to continuance in it, and hauing in the second Chapter confuted contrarie er∣rors, and corruptions of false teachers who sought to thrust on the Colossians other things besides Christ, or with Christ, as meanes of saluation, partly, out of Philo∣sophie, and partly, out of the Ceremoniall law: the Apo∣stle, I say, hauing thus laid downe the truth of Christian doctrine and confuted contrarie errors, and so ended his first part of this Epistle.
The se d part of the E∣pistle.In this Chapter hee comes to the second part of it, (namely) to intreate of Christian life and conuersation, shewing how Christians ought to walke and behaue them∣selues both in respect of God, and men, both in their ge∣nerall and speciall callings, whereunto hee exhorteth in these two Chapters following. This Chapter consisteth of two parts. The first a ge∣nerall exhor∣tation. The second a comprehensi∣on of certaine speciall Chri∣stian duties.This third Chapter consisteth of these two parts. The first, is an exhortation to all Christians, generally as they are Christians and professors of the Gospell from the 1. verse to the 18. The second part is a comprehension of certain speciall duties of Christians, as they haue relation one to another in some particular state and condition of life, as of the dutie of wiues towards their husbands, children towards their parents, seruants towards their masters; the Apostle exhorting thereunto from the 18. verse of this Chapter to the second verse of the 4. Chapter. The generall exhortation subdiuided.Now the generall exhortation may bee againe subdiui∣ded: it containes in it an exhortation to seeke, and to ef∣fect heauenly things, from the first verse to the fift, and then an exhortation to Christian duties of the morall Law, to duties required of Christians in the Commande∣ments of God, and first to the duties of the second Table, from the 5. verse to the 16. and then to duties of the first Table in the 16. and 17. verses. Now then the foure first verses of this Chapter contain an exhortation to seeke, and to effect things aboue, and not things on the earth, and that exhortation is expounded and vrged in the 1. & 2. verses, and then in the 3. & 4. ver∣ses is that remooued which might discourage from that seeking and affecting of things aboue. In this first verse, more specially we haue the Apostles exhortation to seeke things that are aboue, which is am∣plified by the place where they are (namely) where Christ is in heauen, together with the glorious state of Christ there, that hee sits at the right hand of God. Seeke those
things which are aboue (where Christ sits &c.) And this ex∣hortation is vrged by an argument taken from the effici∣ent cause of that seeking (namely) fellowship with Christ in his resurrection, and it may be thus framed: If you be ri∣sen with Christ, then seeke those things which are aboue, but you are risen with Christ, that is grounded on the 12. & 13. verses of the Chapter before, where the Apostle saith, as many as beleeued, were buried with Christ, and raised vp with him: and so he brings in this argument as a consequent on that, if then, or, if therefore yee be risen with Christ, seeke those things which are aboue: So then the summe and substance of this verse is this, an exhortation to the Colossi∣ans to seeke things aboue, where Christ is in glory at the right hand of God, vrged from their fellowship with Christ in his resurrection. Come we to the words of it as they are laid downe by the Apostle, and first of these words: (If yee then bee risen with Christ, seeke those things which are aboue.) If then, or if therefore (saith the Apostle) with relation to that which went before, Chap. 2.12.13.Interpreta∣tion. (bee risen with Christ) to bee risen with Christ, is to haue fellowship with Christ in his resurrection, beeing one with him by the bond of his spi∣rit, and by faith to be partakers both of the benefit of his resurrection, (namely) of a full absolution from sinne and iustification, and of the vertue and power of his resurre∣ction to our viuification, to a raising of vs vp, and quick∣ning of vs to newnesse of life in this life, and to the raising vp of our bodies to life euerlasting, at the day of iudge∣ment. (Seeke) this word (seeke) is Metaphoricall, bor∣rowed and taken from those that seeke, and search for somethings which they would gladly find; and the mea∣ning of the Apostle is, bestow all kind of endeauour, and labour, vse all good meanes to attaine all those things which are aboue (by things aboue) the Apostle meanes, things in heauen, and yet not things in heauen secret, and hid from vs which are not able to conceiue and compre∣hend,
(for there be things in heauen which eie hath not seene, care hath not heard, and which the heart of man is not able to conceiue) but things reuealed to the eie of faith in the Scripture, that is, the ioies and glorie made knowne to be in heauen, and especially the heauenly and eternal life, with all things belonging to it, as (namely) per∣fect knowledge of God and of Christ; perfect loue of God, and our brethren, and consequently, perfect con∣cord, peace, and tranquilitie of minde, charitie, chastitie, truth, and sincerity, and a perfect transforming of our mindes and willes to the will of God; for these, and such like, are the things aboue in heauen, and these the Apo∣stle would haue the Colossians to seeke after, (for his drift was to perswade to holinesse of life) thus then briefely conceiue we these words, as if the Apostle had said, If yee then be one with Christ by faith and by the bond of his spirit, haue fellowship with him in the benefit, and power of his resurrection, bestow all endeauour and labour, vse all good meanes to obtaine the ioies and glory, and that blessed life, thats made known to bee in heauen, with all things belonging to it. Heere, first obserue we brieflie, before wee come to the handling of the words of this verse, the Apostles methode, his order of proceeding in this Epistle, hee first deliuers truth of Doctrine, and confutes contrary errours, and then comes to exhortation, and to perswade to good life, and conuersation. Vnto teach∣ing of the truth, & con∣futing of er∣rors must bee added exhor∣tation to god∣lie life.Hence we plainely see, it is not ynough, to teach the truth and to confute errors, but to that must be added ex∣hortation to godly life, and this we shall finde, to be an or∣dinary, and constant course, held by our Apostle, in all his Epistles, to instance, in one, in stead of the rest, in his Epistle to the Romanes hauing laide downe the doctrine of free iustification, and of sanctification, the vse of the law, deliuerance from the rigour of it by Christ, the cal∣ling of the Gentiles, and reiection of the Iewes: Chap∣ter
12.1. he comes to exhort to good life, and saith: I be∣seech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God &c. the rea∣son of this order is giuen by the Apostle, Tit. 2.11.12. It is not ynough for men to know the doctrine of the gos∣pell,  and the grace of God that shines to them by the gos∣pell, but they must also by the same be taught to deny vn∣godlinesse, and worldly lust, therefore to the teaching of the trueth must be subioyned exhortation to good life. This then in the first place concernes the teachers of the  word,The duty of teachers. they must not onely teach the truth and confute er∣rors; but they must also ioyne to their teaching exhortati∣on to good life. Againe must teaching and exhortation bee conioyned,  must these two go together,Where do∣ctrine and ex∣hortation are ioined toge∣ther, it is the duty of good hearers to make vse of both. then where this order is ob∣serued, whereunto doctrine is added exhortation, it is not ynough for vs to haue knowledge of the truth, and to haue errors rooted out of our mindes, (that is but to an∣swere one part of our teaching) we must be further answer∣able to our teaching, and according to the same be care∣full to leade a godly, righteous; and sober life; let vs not deceiue our selues, if we say we are of a sound religion, we hate the Pope, and all superstitious, and false doctrine, and yet walke in our old wicked waies, and workes of darke∣nesse, surely our state is no better, (nay it is farre worse) then the state of the poore blinde Papists, and other here∣tickes. Remember what our Sauiour saith: Luk. 12.47. (That seruant that knoweth his Masters will, and prepareth not himselfe, neither doth according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes, and the 48. verse (to whom much is giuen, of him shall much be required.) If the Lord trust vs with much knowledge, certainely he will looke for much obe∣dience at our hands. Now to the doctrine offered from the wordes of this verse, we are first to consider the Apostles argument, hee labours to perswade the Colossians to seeke things aboue, and that they endeauour by all good meanes, to attaine
things in heauen, and especially, an holy, and heauenly life, a life in some measure like to that of Angels and Saints in heauen, by an argument taken from their fellowshippe with Christ in his resurrection, that being one with him by faith, and so pertakers of the benefit of his resurrection to their iustification, they should seeke after an heauenly life. Hence we are giuen to vnderstand thus much, that our vnion with Christ by faith,A true feeling of our selues to haue part in Christ his benefits and merits is a most power∣full argument to stirre vs vp to an holy & heauenly life. and the finding of our selues thereby made partakers of the merits, and benefits of his death, of his resurrection, and of other his workes of me∣diation is as strong an argument and motiue, as any possi∣ble can be to stirre vs vp to endeuour to become holy, and leade an holy and heauenly life, nothing is more power∣full and more preuayling to mooue men to leade a life in some degree like to the life of Angels, and Saints in hea∣uen, then to feele themselues to haue part in the merits of Christ his death and resurrection, and other his workes of mediation. For why? we being one with Christ by faith and thereby finding the comforts that are in Christ, to be∣long to vs, and that we through him are within compasse of Gods speciall loue, it cannot but mooue vs to loue him againe, as Saint Iohn saith: 1. Iohn. 4.19. (We loue him because he loued vs first:) Gods loue first felt warme, and comfortable in our hearts will vndoubtedly kindle in them, an ardent loue of God againe, can wee finde our selues within compasse of Gods speciall loue, and fauour be assured of his comfortable presence, and protection, of our portion in his promise of life, and saluation, of right and title to all the comforts and blessings belonging to the Saints of God in this life, and foreuer, and not to be moo∣ued to loue God againe, and to study to shew our selues thankefull to him in all holy obedience, it is not possi∣ble? The Apostle therefore had great reason to vse this ar∣gument (If yee be risen with Christ, seeke those things which
are aboue) And vpon this ground,The doctrine of free iustifi∣cation by faith in Christ, is vniustly char∣ged to set o∣pen a gappe to loosenesse of life. let vs take knowledge of this that it is but a sophisme, and a deceit thrust vpon some men by strong delusion of the Deuill, to say (as the Papists vse to say) that the doctrine of iustification by faith in Christ, that the doctrine we teach, that wee beeing one with Christ by faith, are partakers of his life, death, and re∣surrection, and all his workes of mediation to our iustifica∣tion is a doctrine of liberty, and that it makes men licen∣tious, sets open a gap to all loosenesse of life, that cannot bee, that doctrine is indeed, the originall and ground of all sincere and holy obedience; and if we thinke, that we by faith apprehend the merit of Christ his death and resur∣rection, for the remission of our sinnes, and iustification, and yet bee wanting in duty and thankefulnesse to God, and liue a prophane, a licentious and loose life; wee de∣ceiue our selues, yea we are yet in our sinnes, if our hearts be possessed with such deceiuing thoughts; neuer was any heart by faith made one with Christ, and bathed in his bloud, but it was thereby made soft, pliable, and obedient to God, and tender, louing, and feelingly affected towards men; yea certainly a liuely feeling in our hearts of the comforts in Christ, and of Gods mercy, in and through him, will set our heads a worke to deuise (if it were possi∣ble) some retribution, and cause vs to say with Dauid, Psal. 116.12. What shall I render vnto the Lord, for all his benefits toward me. In the next place, we are to marke the phrase and forme of speech heere vsed by the Apostle, he saith not (If yee be∣leeue that Christ is risen:) but (If yee bee risen with Christ) I haue already shewed from this manner of speaking in the Chapter before, 12. verse, the neere vnion that is betweene Christ and his true members, and that when hee died, and rose againe, they died, and rose with him, together with the vse, that nothing can disapoint them of the benefit of Christ his death, and resurrection, I will not now againe stand on those thigs, but from hence wee are further
taught thus much. That we must not onely beleeue that Christ rose from the dead for vs,We must first finde in our selues the po∣wer of Christ his resurrectiō raising vs frō the death of sinne to new∣nesse of life. for our iustification; but we must finde our selues risen with him, that is, we must finde our selues par∣takers of the power of his resurrection to raise vs from the death of sinne to newnesse of life; this is one principall effect of the vertue of Christ his resurrection, spoken of by the Apostle, Phil. 3.10. and the vertue of Christ his resur∣rection is the power of his Godhead, or of his spirit where∣by he mightily raised himselfe from death to life; and one notable effect of that power is the raising of his members, from the death of sinne to newnesse of life, and this power wee must finde effectuall in our selues, as the Apostle hath taught it plainely, Rom. 6.4. and in diuers other places, no doubt we haue the point in speculation, wee haue often heard of it. I will therefore endeauour to stirre vs vp to the practise of it,A strong mo∣tiue to stir vs vp to this du∣tie is this, that Christ his re∣surection is no comfort to vs if we bee not risen with him. and to this purpose, consider we but this one thing; Christ his resurrection is a ground of excellent comfort, and without that all our comfort in Christ is nothing; the Apostle hath said it, 1. Cor. 13.15. (If Christ bee not risen, our faith is but vaine, and we are yet in our sinnes.) Now then consider it, howsoeuer it is most true, that Christ is risen, and his resurrection is a singulat comfort to all his true members, yet to vs it is no comfort if we be not risen with him, if we be not raised from the death of sinne, to the life of righteousnesse by the power of his resurrection, hee is not risen to vs as a Sauiour and a conquerour ouer sinne, hell, death, and damnation, but as a iudge to condemne vs: and this we may easily gather out of Reuel. 20.6. Bles∣sed is he that hath his portion in the first resurrection, (that is) in rising from sinne to newnesse of life (for uer him the se∣cond death hath no power.) Heereupon it followes strongly on the contrary, hee that hath not part in the first resurre∣ction, he that is not raised from the death of sinne, to the life of righteousnesse, he shall certainely feele and endure
the paines of the second death, ouer him it shall haue power. Let vs not therefore content our selues to say, wee be∣leeue, as it is in the Creed, that Christ rose againe from the dead: that is no better then the implicite and infolded faith of the Papists, who say they beleeue as the Church beleeues, not knowing what the Church beleeues; such a faith will not comfort vs in the houre of temptation: let vs neuer rest till wee finde our selues risen with Christ, till we feele the power of his resurrection, raising vs vp from the death of sinne to newnesse of life, and that indeed will comfort vs, when we stand in need of comfort, and giue vs assurance that the comfort and benefit of Christ his re∣surrection belongs to vs; yea, that will giue vs assurance that the Lords mercy wil neuer faile vs,Note. he hauing wrought in vs by his spirit, and made vs of vile wretches, vessels of grace and holinesse; of mansions of the Deuill, temples of the holy Ghost, certainely his grace, mercy and good∣nesse shall neuer faile, nor forsake vs, yea this is it that will assure vs that our faith shall neuer faile. It followeth, (Seeke those things which are aboue) (that is) endeauour, labour, and vse all good meanes to attaine them. Hence we are plainly taught, that we must giue all dili∣gence,  that we may attaine an heauenly life,We must giue all diligence that we may attaine an heauenly life. that we may truely know God, and Christ, and our selues, and may truely loue God, and our brethren, and conforme our mindes and willes to the holy will of God, we must seeke for it, as for the thing wee would gladly finde, thus hath our Sauiour commanded, Mat. 6.33. Seeke ye first the kingdome of God, &c. and Mat. 13.45. he compares the kingdome of heauen to a Merchant that seekes good pearles, thereby teaching vs to vse earnest endeauour to at∣taine not only the reward of glory in heauen, but an hea∣uenly conformity, with the blessed Angels, and Saints in this life, and the reason is manifest,  the attainement of this
is very hard, there bee many things to hinder it, as the power of our enemies, the Deuill and his Angels, the lust, and corruption of our owne hearts, the euill examples that be in the world, and manifold troubles and trials, that stand vp, and oppose against it, therefore we must vse most earnest endeauour, and breake through all difficulties to attaine it. If you aske what are the meanes to come vnto it? I answere breifly, diligent hearing, reading, meditating and conferring on the worde, and workes of God, and chiefly of that infinite glory our Sauiour doth now enioy at the right hand of his father, and hath prepared for vs, and adding to these, earnest prayer, and suit to God wher∣of our Sauiour saith, Mat. 7.7. Aske and it shall be giuen you, seeke and yee shall finde, &c. By these meanes wee are to seeke for an heauenly life, and that earnestly, and constantly, as those that would gladly finde it. This then meetes with those carelesse, and carnall peo∣ple who foolishly say they will leaue all to God,Reproofe of carelesse and carnall people who neuer care to seeke after heauenly things, or seeke them ne∣gligently. and thinke they may finde that which they neuer sought, and seeke as though they cared not whether they found or no, yea they sticke not to say that heauenly things may be sought, but other things must be sought after, turning that saying of Christ, (First seeke the kingdome of God, and his righteous∣nesse, and then all things shall bee ministred vnto you) cleane contrarie; first seeke other things, and then the kingdome of God. A motiue to stirre vs vp to a diligent see∣king after hea¦uenly things.Now then to stirre vs vp to greater diligence in seeking after an heauenly conformity, with the blessed angels and Saints; consider onely thus much, wee know not how soone the Lord may bring vs to a triall, whether wee haue earnestly sought after it, or no, and as then such as haue sought heauenly things diligently, shall finde and feele vnspeakable comfort, which they would not misse for all the world, they shall finde boldnesse to speake to GOD by praier, and assurance to be heard: so on
the other side such as haue had no care to seeke after heauenly things, shall finde themselues in time of triall, in a miserable case, feeling no comfort, nor daring to speake to God with any hope to be heard, the Lord him∣selfe hath sayd? Prou. 1.28, that then they shall call vpon him, but hee will not answere, they shall seeke him early, but they shall not finde him: and thats an heauy thing; when the afflicted are forsaken of men, yet this refuge they haue, that they may pray to God, but if they find no com∣fort nor helpe from him, their state then is most wretched, let vs thinke on it, and let it stirre vs now while wee haue time, and before the euill day come vpon vs, earnestly to seeke after heauenly things. One thing more wee are to obserue from these wordes (namely) the obiect of our seeking, expressed by the A∣postle, to bee (thinges aboue in Heauen) in that the A∣postle makes the obiect of our seeking, things aboue in heauen. We are taught thus much, that wee are not to content  our selues, with seeking any thing heere on earth,Such as are made aliue with Christ are not to rest contented in vsing meanes to reach to the holinesse of the best that now liue or heertofore did liue on the face of the eath, being but meere men, but they must en∣deauour after that holinesse that is found in heauen. as the obiect of our endeauour and labour, but we must seeke af∣ter things higher, euen in heauen, in a word more plainly, (keeping to the purpose of the Apostle, which was to per∣swade to an heauenly life) we are heere taught, that as ma∣ny as are made aliue with Christ, and quickened by vertue of his resurrection, are not to content themselues with their endeauour and labour, and vsing all good meanes to reach the holinesse of the best man now liuing on the face of the earth, or that euer liued in the world, beeing but a meere man, I say a meere man to except Christ, who was more, euen God and man, howsoeuer we are to follow the example of such as are good and godly, 1. Cor. 11.1. be ye followers of me, euen as I am of Christ: yet are wee not to rest contented in vsing meanes to reach the holines of any man or woman, the most holy now liuing, or heeretofore liuing on the face of the earth.
The reason of this is plaine, because no man on earth is a perfect patterne of holinesse, the most holy man that is, or euer was, is partly flesh and partly spirit, and that which is sayd of Elias, Iam. 5.17. may be truely said of all Gods children, liuing in this world, they are subiect to pas∣sions, they haue their infirmities, therefore no man, the most holy that is, is a perfect patterne of holines, and con∣sequently we are not to rest contented in vsing meanes, to attaine the holinesse of the best man liuing in this world, we are not there to pitch downe our rest, but we are to en∣deauour by all good meanes, to aspire to that holines, that is found in heauen, it must be one part of our daily praier, (as we are taught by our Sauiour) that we may do the will of God heere in earth as it is done aboue in heauen. Can we in this life come to that perfection of holinesse thats found in heauen, and doe the will of God heere on earth, in that perfection it is done in heauen. I answer no, it cannot, the words of that petition, thy will be done in earth as it is &c. doe not signifie equality, but similitude, wee are not to dreame of any perfection in degree heere in this life, it is anabaptisticall, yet are wee to breath after it, and to sigh and groane, that we are not able to reach it, and by all good meanes to seeke after it, let then as many as finde themselues risen, with Christ, and made aliue by the power of this resurrection (to them be∣longs the vse of this point) let them,  I say, think on this du∣ty,The best and the most holy that are, must take notice of their want of holinesse and labour to a∣spire to a grea¦ter measure. hereby the best of vs may find how short we are of that we ought to come to, no doubt if wee compare our selues with others of the Saints and children of God, that yet liue in this world, we shall find we come farre behind them in many graces, much more are we short of that holines that is found in heauen, I speake not this to make sad the hearts of any, that truely endeauour after holinesse in regard of their great weakenesse, no certainely, the least measure of sauing grace is pleasing to God in Christ, but I speake it to stirre vs vp yet further, to seeke after grace, and ho∣linesse,
& to be displeased with our selues, in regard of our wants and our imperfections, let vs euerie one, euen those that haue the greatest measure of holines remember, that wee must not rest contented to reach the holinesse of the best in this life, but wee are to labour and endeauour after that holinesse that is found in heauen, and let vs with our Apostle: Phil. 3.13. forget that which is behinde and en∣deauor our selues vnto that which is before: and still presse forward, and follow hard toward the marke &c. the grea∣ter measure of holinesse we come to,Note. the greater will be our comfort in this life, and the greater our glory in heauen. Come we now to the amplification of this exhortation in the words following, (where Christ sits at the right hand of God) in these words the Apostle doth expresse the place where those things aboue to be sought for, are (namely) where Christ is in heauen, & withall he doth shew the glo∣rious state of Christ in heauen, that there he sits at the right hand of God, we must stand a while to open the meaning of the wordes (where Christ sits, &c.) that is, in heauen where Christ is, for as the Apostle sayth. Ephes. 1.20.Interpre∣tation. hee set him at his right hand in the heauenly places. Now in that he sayth, there hee sits at the right hand of God; this forme of speech is metaphoricall, and its spoken by way of similitude, to bring down to our reach & vnderstanding the glorious state of Christ in heauen, that there he is ad∣uanced to an infinite, and vnspeakable height of glory, for indeed in proper speech God hath neither right hand nor left, neither can be said to sit, or stand, he is a spirit infinite incomprehensible, filling heauen, and earth, this forme of speech, then is it not to be taken in the proper signification of the words, but as a borrowed speech, its taken from the manner of kings on the earth, who vse to set those at their right hand, whom they purpose most of all to honour, 1, King. 2.19. Salomon in token of honour caused a seat to be set for his mother, and she sate at his right hand, or it is taken from the manner of some great King, who haue∣ing
one onely sonne, his first begotten, who shall bee his heire, and succed him in his Kingdome. He makes him to sit at his right hand, that he may rule in his Kingdome with him, and exercise power and authority, ouer all things be∣longing to the Kingdome, so then by this forme of speech (that Christ sits at the right hand of God) two things are sig∣nified.Two things are signified by Christ his sitting at Gods right hand. First, that Christ is exalted to vnspeakable glory in hea∣uen, 1. Timoth. 3.16. that hee there is partaker of the glory of his father, for the word (God) doth heere signifie God the father, and the authour to the Hebrewes saith, Heb. 1.3. that hee sitteth at the right hand of the Maiesty in the highest places. Secondly, by this phrase is signified, that Christ is exal∣ted to a full administration of his Kingdome: euen to bee the head of his Church, and with his father to bee Lord, and gouernour of heauen and earth, hauing all power gi∣uen to him both in heauen and earth, as himselfe sayth: Matth. 28.18. and this the Apostle shewes plainely, Eph. 1. where hauing sayd, vers. 20. that Christ is set at the right hand of his father: he presently subioynes by way of ex∣position, that he is exalted, farre aboue all principality and that all things are made subiect vnto him, and hee made the head of the Church, 1. Pet. 3.22. the Apostle sayth, he is at the right hand of God, gone into heauen, to whom the Angels and powers, and might, are subiect. Now heere for the better vnderstanding of this poynt, a question is to be answered, it may be demanded, whether Christ be aduanced to the right hand of his father, as God, or as man, or both as God and man▪ I answer in respect of both natures, both as God, and as man, euen Christ, God and man, in one person, as God in∣carnate, and manifested in the flesh, and as man receiued into vnity of person with the sonne of God, for howsoeuer Christ considered as God alone, not manifested in the flesh was Lord and King from all eternity, yet as God incarnate
he beganne to raigne after his ascention into heauen, and againe considered as man alone, hee is not Lord and King, but as man receiued into vnity of person with the God∣head, and subsisting in the second person of the Trinity, thus then wee are to conceiue the words of the Apostle, as if hee had sayd thus: In heauen where Christ as God incarnate, and as man personally vnited to his Godhead, where Christ, God and man, or man and God, both enioy fulnesse of glory, and is exalted to be Lord and King of heauen and earth, euen to rule and gouerne with his father all things both in hea∣uen and earth. First, obserue wee heere that the Apostle doth point out the place of Christ his aduancement to glory (name∣ly) aboue in heauen, for in saying (where Christ sits at the right hand of God) hee giues vs to vnderstand, that aboue  in heauen is Christ aduanced to glory,Though Christ his Kingdome reach to all things, yet doth he as God and man rule in fulnes of glory in heauen. and though Christ his Kingdome extend it selfe ouer all things, yet in heauen alone doth Christ, as God and also as man rule in fulnesse of glory and Maiesty. Hence it is that the Apostle doth expresly and distinctly set downe the place of his exaltation to bee in the highest heauens, Ephes. 20. that he sits at Gods right hand in the heauenly places: and againe, Heb. 1.3. its sayd, that hee sits at the right hand of Maiesty in the highest places: and this meets with that errour of some,  who would gather from Christ his sitting at the right hand of his father, that hee in his manhood is euery where present,Confutation of that con∣ceit, that Christ his sit∣ting at the right hand of his father prooues his presence eue∣ry where in his manhood. whereas in∣deed, his sitting at the right hand of his father rightly vn∣derstood is rather a confutation, then any confirmation of that conceit, because his sitting at the right hand of God, is his manifest exaltation, to rule in fulnesse of glory, and that is (according to the doctrine of the Apostle) in the highest heauens and not elsewhere. Gods right hand is euery where, Christ sits at the right hand of God, therefore his manhood is euery where,  this
is a meere fallation and deceitfull kinde of reasoning. But to answer, so as we may conceiue the trueth, Christ sits at the right hand of God (that is) both as God and man he rules in glory ouer all things, in heauen and earth, may wee thereupon conclude, that hee both as God and as man is in euery place present? no such matter, it will not followe from thence, from his ruling in euery place, is no good argument to inferre his presence in euerie place, in respect of his manhood, wee knowe one may rule in many places where hee is not present in body, and Christ his sitting at the right hand of God, doth not take away the essentiall propertie of his body, which is to bee in one place at one time, if it did, then were Christ his humane nature, by his exaltation not glorified, but abolished and taken away, from these words (where Christ sits &c.) expressing Christ his aduancement in heauen, two things are further offered to our consideration. The first is this, Christ our head and Sauiour doth en∣ioy in heauen incomprehensible glory,Christ in his manhood personally v∣nited to his Godhead doth enioy vnspeakable glory in hea∣uen. euen in our na∣ture, Chist in his manhood personally vnited to his God∣head▪ is partaker of vnspeakeable glory, not only infinitly exceeding the glory of all the sonnes of men, whose glory is lesse then a shadow in comparison of it, but also of the most holy and glorious Angels, as the Apostle sayth, Phil. 2.9. God hath highly exalted him, and giuen him a name aboue euery name, and Heb. 1.13. sayth the holy Ghost, vnto which of the Angels, said hee at any time, sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstoole, giuing vs to vnderstand, that his glory is far aboue the glory of the most glorious angels, yea, such is the visible glory & bright∣nes of Christ his manhood, that its said to bee the light of  the heauenly Ierusalem,Confutation of Christ his bodily pre∣sence in the Sacrament. Reu. 21.23. & this light and glory cannot bee separated from the body of Christ, how then can he be present in body (as the Papists say) in the sacra∣ment, and not be seen of any, is it possible, no certainly, its as much as to giue the lie to the holy Ghost, & to say, that Christs body is not glorious in heauen.
The vse of this point for our selues, is full of  sweete comfort, to as many as truely beleeue in Christ,It is a great comfort to all true beleeuers that Christ is now most glorious in himselfe, for he will one day be most glorious in in his mem∣bers also. (to them belongs the comfort of it, and let not others meddle with it) as many as are true belee∣uing members of Christ, may hence gather matter of ex∣ceeding great comfort, for why? is it so that Christ our head is already possessed of vnspeakable glory in heauen? then certainely in time he will make vs pertakers of the same, he now is most glorious in himselfe, he will one day be most glorious in his members, it is one part of his prai∣er, Iohn 17.24. That his members should be with him, and bee partakers of his glory. And the Apostle saith plainely, Phil. 3.21. Hee shall change our vile body, that it may bee fashioned like vnto his glorious body. How then shall not this fill the hearts of all true beleeuers with aboundance of comfort, howsoeuer in this world we are despised, made as the re∣fuse, and ofscouring of all things, had in derision, and bee scorned and contemned of the world, yet as the holy Ghost exhorts, Heb. 12.2. Let vs looke vp to Iesus the au∣thor, and finisher of our faith, who for the ioy that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised the shames and is now at the right hand of God. And remember that hee hath prepa∣red like glory for vs in heauen, and it will make vs endure the crosse, and despise the shame; yea let such as now, ei∣ther lie vnder some lingring disease or are pinched in their bodies, with hunger, cold, nakednesse, and their bodies are tossed from post to pillar, buffeted, beaten, spit on, and many waies abused; yet they beleeuing in Christ, let them thinke on this to their comfort, that those distressed, or a∣ny way abused bodies of theirs, shall one day be cloathed with glory, and made like the glorious bodie of Christ Ie∣sus; yea remember that this is a thing so cleare, and so certaine, that the Apostle doubts not to affirme, that wee already sit with Christ in heauenly places, Ephes. 2.6. Let then as many as truely beleeue in Christ thinke on this, as an infaliible truth to their comfort.
I come to the next thing, the point is this, Christ our head and Sauiour,Christ our head and Sa∣uiour is Lord and King of all things, go∣gouerning his Church in spe∣ciall manner, and exercising his power to the confusion of such as op∣pose him. is Lord and King of all things, gouer∣ning his Church and members in this world in speciall manner, gathering them out of the world, guiding them in the way to heauen, exercising them vnder afflictions and temptations, to spirituall obedience, supporting them in their troubles, and defending them against the rage of all enemies whatsoeuer, and againe, exercising his power ouer all that oppose themselues to his kingdome, to their vtter confusion, that place Ephes. 1.22. makes this mani∣fest. The Apostle saith that Christ sitting at the right hand of God, is made head to his Church, to gouerne it as a head, and that all other things are vnder his feet, and espe∣cially the enemies of his kingdome, to tread them downe at his pleasure, for howsoeuer the enemies of his Church are vnder his feete, to tread them downe when he will, yet he suffereth them for a time to exercise some power, and rage ouer his Church in this life,Note. because hee will haue his members made conformable to himselfe, in a measure of suffering, and some among the enemies of his Church be∣long to the election of grace, and he will not destroy them with the rest, and because the number of the elect is not yet full, but in the end he will bring them to vtter destru∣ction, and to strengthen our faith in this, we see that Christ our Lord and King, doth sometimes manifest his power in bringing to naught the plots and deuises of the enemies of his Church, and in bringing confusion vpon them, as he did on those Gunpouder-Traitors, who intended the ouerthrow of the Gospell,  and of his Church in this land. We are to ascribe our deliuerance from that intended mis∣chiefe not to any worldly meanes,Comfort to all that truely beleeue in Christ against the feare of a∣ny aduersary power what∣soeuer. or pollicy, but only to the al-sufficient defending power of Iesus Christ, to him alone belongeth the praise and glory of that our great de∣liuerance, and to him we must shew our selues thankefull, and let the consideration of Christ his great power, com∣fort and encourage all that beleeue in him, against the fear
of any aduersary power whatsoeuer, lets know whatsoeuer the enemies of Christ and his Church, Antichrist, and the rest doe against his members, they shall not preuaile to the hurt of their soules, Christ sits in heauen, and ouer-rules them, limiting their power, and their rage, and in the end he will vtterly destroy it, yea they may as well pull Christ out of his seat in heauen, as one of his members out of his handes, and that is an excellent comfort, for all that truly beleeue in Christ. VER. 3. Set your affections on things which are aboue, and not on things which are on the earth. In this verse, we haue the other part, or branch of the Apostles exhortation propounded, wherein hee doth ex∣hort the Collossians to minde, and affect things aboue, Set your affections on things which are aboue, and this is fur∣ther enlarged by dehortation from the contrary, that they doe not minde nor affect things on earth:) And not on things &c.) The word heere translated (Set your affections,Interpreta∣tion. &c.) is a generall word comprehending the actions, and operati∣ons, both of the vnderstanding and will; wee finde it in Scripture, applied to both, but most commonly to the a∣ctions of will and affections, which are particular motions of the will, and so it may bee well rendred as heere it is (Set, &c.) or as we haue it, Rom. 8.5. (sauour) the meaning of the Apostle is this, (minde and affect) and in particular, let your thoughts and meditations, your care, your desire, your loue, and longing, be set on things aboue, (by things aboue) as before was shewed, we are to vnderstand the ioies and glory of heauen, and especially the heauenly life, that is made knowne to be in heauen, and all things belonging to it, as perfect knowledge of God, and of Christ, perfect loue of God and of our brethren, and a perfect conformi∣ty of minde and will to the will of God, (and not on things
which are on the earth) By things on the earth the Apostle meaneth things of this life, things that pertaine onely to the mainetenance of naturall life in this world, as meate, drinke, apparell, riche &c. euen all things whatsoeuer they be, seruing either for our necessity, or for our delight in this life onely,; therefore 1. Cor. 7.31. the Apostle shuts them vppe vnder one word, euen vnder the names of this world (they that vsed this world) meaning the things of this world, seruing for our our vse onely in this life, thus then wee are to concee the Apostles meaning in the words of this verse, as if he had thus spoken. Minde, and affect, let your meditations, thoughts, and musings, your care, your desire, your loue, and longing, be set on the ioies and glory of heauen, and especially, on that heauenly life that is made knowne to be in heauen, and on all things belonging to it, and pull away your mindes, and affections, your thought, your care, your de∣sire, and your loue, from all earthly things whatsoeuer, seruing either for necessity, or for delight in this life onely; now heere: First, wee are to marke, that our Apostle was not con∣tent to say (Seeke things aboue, &c.) endeauour and la∣bour by all good meanes to attaine them, but he addes to this, (set your affections on things which are aboue.) We must not only seeke the things that are aboue in hea∣uen, but wee must also minde and affect them.Hence, we are giuen to vnderstand thus much, that it is not enough for vs to seeke the things that are aboue, the things made knowne to be in heauen, but we must minde and affect them, our thoughts must runne vpon them, and our hearts must be lift vp aboue all earthly things, and set on things found at the right hand of God in heauen, thi∣ther must our care, thither must our desire our loue and longing be carried, for why? as our Sauiour hath taught vs, Math. 6.20. Our treasure must be in heauen, and there al∣so must our hearts be, yea certainely, as he saith in that place, If your treasure be in heauen, there will your hearts bee also, our hearts will follow our treasures. 1. Pet. 1.4. the
Apostle saith, (our inheritance) euen that which all true beleeuers looke to be possessed of (is in heauen) therefore it is meete that our minds should be there. Now for the reason of this duty,  we need seeke no fur∣ther then this very text, the Apostle saith, we are to seeke after heauenly things, and to giue all diligence to finde them; and that we shall neuer doe vnlesse we minde, and affect them, we know it in matters, and businesses of the world, what thing soeuer we minde and set our hearts vp∣on, that we follow earnestly, and withall our strength, so certainely, if our mindes and affections be vpon heauenly things, we shall with earnest endeauour seeke after them; therefore it is needefull that our mindes and affections bee set on things aboue. We see then our duty, let vs hereby examine our selues,  and if we duely examine our selues concerning this duty,Most men are defectiue in this dutie, they doe not mind and affect hea∣uenly things. I feare me the most of vs shall find our selues much wan∣ting, and farre short of that we ought to come vnto. Doe our thoughts euer runne on heauenly things? Are our mindes and affections fully set and fixed on them? Surely if wee deale truely with our selues, I doubt wee shall finde that the thoughts of most of vs are otherwise taken vp, and that our care, desire, loue, and longing, are spent on o∣ther things, to passe by such as manifestly discouer, that they minde nothing lesse, then things aboue, a man may iudge of their inwards, by the foame, and filth that comes from them, they foame out the folly of their owne hearts, in cursing, swearing, rayling, filthy speaking, and the like; to passe by them, I appeale to such as seeme to bee better minded, whether their thoughts, their care, their desire, their loue, and longing, be not rather spent on the things of this world, then on things aboue in heauen; certaine∣ly if we be not partiall to our selues, and blinded with our owne carnall selfe-loue, we must needes confesse it to bee so, in the most of vs; as it was said to Peter, Mark. 14.17. Thou art of Galile for thy speach is like. So I may iustly say
to many of vs, thou art of the world, thy speech is like, thou sauourest not the things of God, but the things of the world, thy speach bewraieth thee, thou art able to speake much, and to the purpose of the things of this world, but when thou commest to speake of heauen and heauenly things, thy tongue doth faulter, and cleaues to the roofe of thy mouth. Againe, we know that one that is in a strange Countrey, and minds homeward, he will euer be enquiring, and that wishingly, after the way that leadeth to his dwelling, now where is almost that man or woman that doth thus wish∣ingly enquire after heauen? nay surely, the way beeing pointed out vnto vs, the most of vs haue little, or no care to walke in it, and that is a plaine euidence, that our minds are not thitherward, our hearts and affections are not set on heauen and heauenly things; happily thou hast a good liking, and a little taste of the powers of the world to come as it is Heb. 6.5. and therewith thou art content, and dost please thy selfe; deceiue not thy selfe, that liking and taste may be in one that neuer shall bee saued; thou must haue more then a taste, euen a true, and sound affection set on things aboue. Thou wilt say, how shall I know that I haue more then a taste of them, that I haue a true and sound affection to them. By two things, first, if thou haue a care to vse all good  meanes, for the continuance, and confirmation of that af∣fection in thee. Secondly, if that minde bring foorth a loue to God for so great a mercy, in working that affection in thee, and that loue be expressed in duties of loue, both to God and men, then indeed thine heart is right within thee, and thy affection truely set on things aboue and this must bee in euery one of vs,Motiues to stirre vs vp to this dutie. and to stirre vs vp to this duty, consi∣der we. First, the comfort that Gods spirit doth worke in the
hearts of true beleeuers in this life, he works sometimes so great comfort in their hearts, as maks them vndergoe most exquisite torments, euen with singing. Againe, consider the comfort of a good conscience in  this life, though it be mingled with some feare: yet as Sa∣lomon saith, Prou. 15.15. It is a continuall feast. Oh then the ioy and comfort of the holy Ghost dwelling in vs in hea∣uen, and the peace and comfort of a good conscience there, where it shall be free from feare, must needes be in∣finite and vnspeakable: let then the consideration of the beginnings of heauenly comfort so sweete and excellent, euen in this life, raise vp our hearts aboue al earthly things, and stir vs vp to set our minds and affections on the things that are at the right hand of God in heauen. In the next place, in that the Apostle doth exhort (to set our affections on heauenly things.) We plainely see, that religion doth not take away and  abolish humane affections (as some haue foolishly thought) but doth onely order them,Religion doth not take a∣way and abo∣lish humane affections, but doth onely order them. and bring them in∣to subiection to the will of God; we are not taught by re∣ligion to put out affections, but to labour to haue them sanctified, and by grace mooued to a right obiect, with due measure and moderation, according to the nature of the obiect: we are taught in many places of Scripture, to hate euill and to loue good, to reioice with them that reioice, to be sorry with the afflicted, &c. And there be two reasons why affections are not abo∣lished, but onely ordered. The first is this, God himselfe planted them in the heart  of man in the first creation, they beeing nothing else but particular motions of his will, and therefore they are not to be taken away by religion; for religion is not to extin∣guish any power or motion of the minde or will, but one∣ly to remooue the corruption of it. Secondly, affections renued containe in them a great  part of holinesse and of the image of God, and being orde∣red
by grace carry vs forward to a notable high degree of holinesse. Hence it is that they are compared to strings of musical instruments, which being well tuned, and rightly moued make a sweete harmony: so affections ordered by grace, and mooued by the spirit, are the matter of many excel∣lent vertues, and therefore they are not to bee rooted out, but we are to labour to haue them rightly ordered. And seeing religion doth not abolish, but order affecti∣ons, we ought therefore to spie out the motions and incli∣nations of our hearts, and to labour that they may be san∣ctified,We must spie out the moti∣ons and incli∣nations of our hearts, and la∣bour to haue them sanctifi∣ed and ightly ordered. and mooued by grace, as that our anger and hatred may be against sinne, our loue may be to goodnesse, &c. And the rather let vs striue, that the motions of our hearts and willes may be thus sanctified, because beeing in their naturall condition, they carry vs with a violent course to the highest pitch of sinne: and hence it is, that they are cald motions of sinnes, Rom. 7.5. and they are the very fire and fuell of sinne; to insist in one particular, experi∣ence may teach, that the desire of mans heart not sanctifi∣ed, is commonly so set on the things of this world, as it cannot be satisfied, and if it be suffered to runne at large, it will carry a man headlong to the pit of perdition, 1. Tim. 6 9.10. They that will be rich, &c. Now desire is not to be rooted out, but to be ordered by grace, and turned ano∣ther way, and set on heauen, and heauenly things; and thus we are to deale with the motions of our hearts, wee are to labour to haue them sanctified, and rightly ordered, and know we that according to our affections, so shall wee profit both by the workes and word of God: many see the wonderfull workes of God,Note. and heare his word, with others, and yet profit not as others doe, because the Lord hath not giuen them the like good affections; when therefore thou seest the iudgements of God, on any place, or person, or hearest his word, pray that the Lord would fill thine heart with holy affections and the Lord so doing
without question: thou shalt profit by the same. Marke further that our Apostle to his exhortation (set your affections on things which are aboue) addes a dehortation from seting our affections on things which are on the earth. Hence it is cleere that we cannot mind and affect things  aboue, and the things on the earth both together,We cannot mind & affect things heauen¦ly and things earthly both togeher. it is not possible that our care, desire, loue and liking should be sete on thinges aboue and thinges on the earth both at one time, Phil. 3.19.20. the Apostle makes a flat opposition betweene minding earthly things, and hauing our conuer∣sation in heauen, as it becommeth true beleeuers: let no man then deceiue himselfe and say,  or thinke that he may minde or affect things aboue, and earthly things together,They decciue themselues who thinke they may ear∣nestly seeke after earthly things, and yet minde and affect things heauenly. it is as possible to looke vpward, and downeward both at once, yea, know wee that it is a dangerous thing by hot and earnest pursuit to seeke after earthly things, though it be by good and lawfull meanes, that greedy hunting after them, will make vs settle on our dregs, so as in time we shall looke for no other happines but in them. Indeed we may vse the world, and the things of the world, but it must bee according to the rule of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 7.31. as though we vsed them not, and so as they may help vs forward in our trauell towards heauen, and so as our harts be not ensnared with any thing in the world; yea we may vse the things of this world somtimes for delight, yet in our lawfull delitght in them,Note our chiefe ioy must be at the right hand of God in Heauen. And now to speake something that may tend to withdraw our hearts from the world and the things of the world, to which they are euen wedded, and will hardly heare of any diuorce, yet to this purpose consider,A motiue to withdraw our hearts from the world and the things of it. we only the condition of the things of this life, that they are things transitory, and of small continuance, this being well con∣sidered is of weight & able to disswade any one that is en∣dued but with common sence, from wedding his mind to thē, for who is it, but he that hath his eies shut vp, & cannot see things that differ, knowing that he hath but a short time to enioy
the things of this life, and the things themselues vani∣shing and flitting away as a shadow, that will make account of them as his owne, and promise himselfe any long time in them, it was the foolish conceit of the rich man, Luk. 12, 19. Soule thou hast much goods layd vp for many yeeres, liue at ease, eat, drinke, and take thy pastime, he thought hee had a perpetuity in his goods, but what was the answer of God to him, thou foole, &c. and indeed what greater folly? what more wilfull madnes can there be then this? for a man to giue his heart ouer to such things, as are shut vp in a vapour a shadow, a puffe of winde, a bubble, or (such is mans life) which when they continue the longest, are but as a spanne long, cut off by death, short and momentary; Oh then let not our soules (which we hope shall liue with the Lord, for euer) be so abased, as to be set on vanishing, and transitory things, but let them be raised vp to meditate, minde and affect the things that last for euer, euen the things found in Iesus Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his father in heauen. VER. 3. For yee are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. The first wordes of this verse, containe an argument to confirme the Apostles dehortation, in the last wordes of the second verse, (namely) from minding and affecting things on the earth, and the argument is from the con∣dition of the Colossians beleeuing in Christ (that they were dead) and it may thus bee framed, dead men haue no minde, nor further care for the things of this life, but yee are deade, therefore you ought not to minde them. Now to this argument, happily the Colossians might take exception, they might reply and say, are wee dead? why then wee are not to minde and affect things aboue, dead men minde nothing, the Apostle therefore preuents
this obiection, in the next words by further explication of his speech, letting them vnderstand that howsoeuer they were dead, yet not simply dead, but so as they had life, and hee sets downe what manner of life they had (name∣ly a life hid, yet are dead, and your life is hid) yet heereup∣on peraduenture the corrupt nature of man might further inferre, and say, is our life hid doth it not appeare, why then should we seeke and affect things that pertaine to that life that appeares not, and omit the things of this life? this also the Apostle doth meet withall, and to this hee answers in the words following, setting before them how this life was hid (namely with Christ.) Secondly in whom it was hid euen in God. And thirdly, the time when it should be fully reuealed,  verse the fourth, as if hee had sayd, howsoeuer, it is true, that your life is hid, yet no otherwise then Christ is nowe hid, and it is hid in God, who is a safe keeper of it, and in time it shall certainely bee reuealed; so then in this third verse, wee haue a reason yeelded, why the beleeuing Co∣lossians should not minde and affect things on the earth, because they were dead. Which is further explained, how farre foorth they were dead, euen so as notwithstanding they had life: and that life hidde, with the manner how, and in whome it was hidde (namely, with Christ in God.) Let vs now search out the meaning of the wordes of this verse (for yee are dead) that is with Christ, as wee haue it in the chapter before, verse the twentieth, you be∣ing one with Christ by faith are dead with him, that is,Interpreta∣tion. as partakers of the power of his death, and are as dead men in regarde of sinne, and of worldly happinesse standing in worldly pleasures, profits and honours, and such like, and your life) that is, your happy life begunne in this world, to bee made perfect in the life to come, that per∣fection of holinesse, and glory, that once yee shall haue both in your bodies and soules; and that I gather to be the
meaning of this worde (life) from the Apostles owne words, in the verse following, where hee sayth, that when Christ which is your life shall appeare, then shall ye also appeare ith him in glory. Euen in perfection of glory, and so hee doth expound this word (life) now hid, to be that glory that shall be reuealed at the comming of Christ, & that is fulnesse of happinesse and glory, wherewith the bodyes and soules of true beleeuers shall then bee inuested (is hid) that is not onely kept from the eyes of the world, who haue no sight of it at all, but in great measure from the eye of true beleeuers themselues, who are therefore sayd to walke by faith, and not by sight, 2. Cor. 5.7. (with Christ) that is aboue in heauen, where Christ is, and is hid as Christ is now hid, who is hid from the eyes of all that liue on the earth, hee sitting in fulnesse of glory at the right hand of his father, (in God) that is, in the hand of God, in his grace, mercy and power, for as it is sayd, Acts. 17.28 that in God wee liue, mooue, and haue our bee∣ing, our life, our moouing, and beeing in this world is in him, that is in his hand and power, so the life and glory that shall be bestowed on true beleeuers being (as the A∣postle sayth) hid in God, the meaning is, that it is layd vp in his gracious and powerfull hand: thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of the words of this verse as if the Apostle had sayd. For ye beleeuing in Christ, are partakers of the power of his death, and are as dead men in regard of sinne, and of worldly happinesse and your happy life, your perfecti∣on of holinesse, and glory, that once you shall haue both in your bodies and soules, is altogether hid from the eyes of the world and in great measure from your selues, euen as Christ now sitting at the right hand of his father, is hidde from the eies of men on the earth, and is layd vp in the gra∣cious and powerfull hand of God. Now here first we are to obserue, that as from hauing part with Christ in his resurrection, our Apostle in the first ver.
perswaded to seeke and affect things aboue, so now from their fellowship with Christ in his death, he disswades from minding and affecting earthly things, he reasons thus, you being partakers with Christ in his death, are as dead men in regard of sinne, and worldy happinesse, therefore doe not you minde and affect earthly things. Hence we may take vp this conclusion, that fellowship  with Christ in his death,Fellowship with Christ in his death is a∣ble to make vs as dead men in regard of loue and affe∣ction to the things of this life. the hauing of part with Christ in the power of his death, is able to make vs as dead men in re∣gard of our loue & affection to the things of this life, it will make our hearts as dead within vs, in regard of any affecti∣on to earthly things, though we vse them, & may lawfully vse them, yea if it bee abundance of outward things that God hath giuen vs, yet if we haue part with Christ in the power of his death, that will make vs that wee shall not set our hearts vpon them, but in the preparation of our harts, we shall be ready to forgoe all things wee enioy for Christ, and for the profession of the Gospell, if wee cannot holde them together, for as the Apostle sayth, Gal. 2.19. they that are Christs are crucified with Christ, and being crucified with him they haue crucified the flesh with the lusts therof & as it is Gal. 5.24. their affections are crucified, and dead in respect of sins, pleasures and the profits of this life, euen whatsoeuer is opposed to the kingdome of Christ, and to a new creature. Let this serue as a ground of triall to euery man, wee perswade our selues that Christ died for vs,  and that we haue part in his death to our comfort,If we feele not the power of Christ his death making vs as dead in regard of loue and affe∣ction to earth∣ly things, wee can haue no comfort in his death. heereby we may try it, if we finde Christ his death powerfull in vs, to the mortification of our owne wicked willes and carnall affections, that we are as dead men, in regard of loue and and affection to earthly things, then indeed wee haue fel∣lowship, and part with Christ in his death to our comfort, but if our hearts and mindes bee as quicke and ready, as liuely as euer they were to meditate and thinke of, to loue and desire earthly things, and as strongly carried after, and set on those things; whatsoeuer wee say or pretend, it
skils not, the truth is, we are neither partakers of the death of Christ, nor haue any liuely hope of a better life. Oh that wicked worldlings whose hearts are glued to the world, and to the things of this world, would but du∣ly consider this, that the setting of their hearts on the ho∣nours, pleasures, profites and preferments of this life is a plaine testimonie that they haue no part in the death of Christ; indeede it is not possible to be altogether voyd of all affection to the things of this life, so long as wee are in the body, such is our corruption, and the things themselues are needfull for the maintenance and wellbeing of the bo∣die in this world, yet take this with you, if wee bee dead with Christ, if wee haue part with him in the power of his death, certainely our hearts will euery day more and more be weaned, & withdrawn from the loue, and liking of the things of this earth, and more and more be set on things heauenly, and therefore it is a dangerous case, when men and women grow old, and in respect of their bodies are decrepit, decayed and halfe dead, and haue one foot as it were in the graue, if then their hearts bee more wedded to the world, and set on earthly things, and if then they bee more greedy of the things of this life, without question, that is a dangerous case, it is a signe that they neuer had part in the power of Christ his death, for that would make their affections together with their bodie, by little and lit∣tle, to die to the things of this world, and let vs know, that if we haue no part in the power of Christ his death, we can haue no comfort in the merit of it, Gal. 6.14, God for∣bid (sayth the Apostle) that I should reioyce, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, and marke what followes, whereby the world is crucified vnto mee, and I vnto the world: where he shewes plainely in the generall, that none can truely glory in the crosse of Christ, but only they who by the power of it are dead to the world, and the world to them, as for others that feele not that power, they can no more glory in the crosse of Christ, then a man may glory
of the victory his Prince hath gotten ouer enemies, him∣selfe in the meane time beeing a vassall, and slaue vnto them, let this bee thought on by as many as finde their hearts wholly or chiefely set on earthly thinges, and let it stirre vs vp neuer to rest till wee finde, and feele Christ his death powerfull in vs, to weane vs from the loue of the things of this life, yea, though wee haue abundance of them, and hold, and enioy them, yet let not our hearts bee set on them, the Papists say it is a state of perfection to haue nothing to doe with the things of this life, now that is but a fancy, it is rather a state of perfection,Note. or comming neere to perfection (for we are not to dreame of any ab∣solute perfection in this life) in the middest of the abun∣dance of the things of this life, not to haue our hearts set vpon them. The next thing we are to consider in this verse is in these words, (your life is hid.) Hence we are giuen to vnderstand thus much, that the happinesse, and glory,The happines and glory of true beleeuers prepared for thē in the life to come is al∣together hid from the eye of the world. the comfort and ioy vnspeakeable  and glorious as the Apostle Peter cals it, 1. Pet. 1.8. of true beleeuers begun in this life, and to be made perfect in the life to come, is a thing altogether hid from the eye of the world, the world hath no manner of sight nor apprehen∣sion, nor vnderstanding of it, no not so much as a glimps of the world sees the outside of a true beleeuer, his face, his countenance, his outward gesture and behauiour, and his visible state and condition in the world, but they neither see nor conceiue the beauty, and glorie that is within, as it is sayd of the Church: Psal. 45.13. She is all glorious with∣in, and that glory the world sees not, and as Eliphas sayth, Iob. 22.20. our substance is hid, men of the world may see the colour & outward skin of true beleeuers, but they can∣not diue into the substance of their happines, and comfort begun in this life, to be made perfect in the life to com. One reason of this is giuen by Saint Iohn. 1.3.1. name∣ly this, because the world knowes not God, behold (sayth
he) what loue the father hath shewed on vs that we should bee called the sonnes of God, for this cause the worlde knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him) it knowes not God to bee a grations father to his children, nor Gods dealing with his children, and therefore it knoweth not their adoption, their happinesse, and the inheritance hee hath prouided for them, and the comfort he hath begun in their heart, in this life, and will perfect in the life to come. Againe, true inward comfort in the heart, is a thing strange and vnknowen to men of the world, they are not acquainted with it, they neuer felt it in themselues, and therefore it is not possible, they should discerne or take knowledge of it in others. First therefore this may discouer vnto vs whence it is, that wicked prophane persons, doe hold the true seruice of God performed by true beleeuers a most vnprofitable thing,Whence it is that prophane persons doe hold the true seruice of God which true beleeuers yeeld vnto him a most vnprofitable thing. yea the greatest drudgery in the world, and the life of a true Christian, the most heauy dumpish and most vn∣comfortable life that possible can be, heere is the reason of it, they haue not eyes to see the comfort of that life, it is hid from them, and they iudge other men by themselues, they thinke no prison so irkesome as the Church, no toile more painefull then prayer, hearing the word, receiuing the Sacraments, they hold no bondage so greeuous, as re∣straint from sinfull and vngodly courses, yea, as the Apo∣stle Peter sayth. 1.4.4. it seemes strange to them, that true  beleeuers runne not to the same excesse of riot with them, therefore they thinke no misery so bitter,Comfort and encourage∣ment of true beleeuers a∣gainst the scorne and contempt that is cast vp∣on them by the wicked world. as sound and sin∣cere profession of the Gospell, because (indeed) they haue no apprehension of the comfort of that life. Againe, for further vse of this poynt, let the considera∣tion of it arme all true beleeuers against scorne and con∣tempt cast vpon them, by the wicked and prophane of the world, they are euer censuring true beleeuers, deriuing their profession, and insulting ouer their meane and mise∣rable condition (and as they thinke of it) & stick not to say
What difference (I pray you) is betweene them and vs, but onely this; we see they thriue not so well in the world, they are many waies crossed, yea, sometimes they say, they can speake by experience, themselues haue beene profes∣sors as forward as others, and yet yet neuer got good by it, as the Prophet brings in the wicked of his time quarrelling and saying, Mal. 3.14. It is in vaine to serue God. Alas poore soules, let them alone, let not this discourage any one that truely feares God, let vs consider that they haue no vnderstanding of the happinesse and comfort of true beleeuers; a sinner nnot discrne the happinesse of a true Christian, nor conceiue how God deales with him, he is a meere stranger to his ioy and comfort, the Manna hee feeds on is hidden, Reuel. 2.17. Therefore let not the mur∣muring, or the scorne of wicked and prophane persons, preuaile in the eares, or hearts or of any that haue vnder∣standing. One thing more note we from hence, namely this. That perfection of happinesse and holinesse, is in great measure hid from true beleeuers themselues,Perfection of happinesse & holinesse is in great part hid from true be∣leeuers them∣selues. though they haue the beginnings of it, yet the fulnesse of it doth not appeare to them, 1 Ioh. 3.2. Saint Iohn saith plainely, That now we are the sonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare what we shall be. And Rom. 8.23.24. We which haue the first fruits of the spirit, euen we doe sigh in our selues, waing for the adop∣tion, euen the redemption of our body. We ought therefore with patience to wait for the ac∣complishment of our happinesse and holinesse,  we are not to thinke (as the wicked doe) that there is no profit in ser∣uing the Lord,We are pati∣ently to waite for the accom¦plishment of our hapinesse and holinesse. vnlesse we haue present preferment in this world, our principal pay wil be in the life to come, we haue part in hand by grace in our soules, in this life, and the rest is behinde till the pay day in the world to come; yea, let all Gods children heerein comfort themselues, they groane vnder the burden of their sinnes, and feele the want of ho∣linesse, let them know that in this life,Note they shall neuer feele
holinesse, as they feele sinne; it is an excellent place to this purpose, the Apostle there saith, Gal. 5.5. That through the spirit we waite for the hope of righteousnesse through faith: that is, for full reuelation of righteousnesse imputed, and for the accomplishment of the effect of it (namely) sanctifica∣tion, we are to waite for it through faith; if wee haue the first fruits of the spirit (namely) an hatred of our owne sinne, a purpose of not sinning, and the true feare of God in our hearts; let vs comfort our selues in that, and waite for fulnesse of grace and holinesse in the life to come, as yet perfection of holinesse is hid from vs, in time it shal be reuealed, and we shall come vnto it. Come wee to the manner, how the life of true beleeuers is hid, expressed by the Apostle in these words (with Christ) that is no otherwise then Christ is now hid, who sits at the right hand of his father, and is hid from the bodily eies of all that liue on the earth: to omit that which hence may be gathered, that our happinesse shall not be hid for euer, but in time be reuealed, because it is hid as Christ is now hidde, who in time shall shew himselfe from heauen in glorie of that wee shall more fitly speake in the next verse. Obserue we from these words onely thus much. That the Lord Iesus is now in heauen hid from the bo∣dilie eies of all that liue on the earth,Christ now in heauen is hid from the bo∣dily eies of all that liue on the face of the earth. the Saints in heauen in their soules now see Christ as he is in fulnesse of glory, and in their soules they haue immediate fellowship with him, according to that wish of the Apostle, Phil. 1.23. and after the generall resurrection, they shall see him with their bodily eies likewise, but he is yet hid from vs now liuing in this world, we see him not with our bodily eies, for as the Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 5.6. While we are at home in the bo∣dy, we are absent from the Lord. He is absent from vs in his body, and we are absent from him, and we see him not, he is ascended into heauen, and as Peter saith Act. 3.21. Hea∣uen must containe him untill the time that all things be restored.
Christ hath beene seene of some whiles they liued heere in this world, as of Stephen,  Act. 7.55. and of Paul in his iourney. Act. 9. Let this be granted, that Christ was seene of some,  yet liuing in this world, yet wee must know their sight of Christ was extraordinarie; and againe it can neuer bee prooued that they saw him out of heauen, the text is plaine, that Stephen looked stedfastly into heauen, and that Christ also spake to Paul from heauen, from whence the glorious light shined and yet a learned Papist in a booke latelie published takes on him by warrant of that apparisi∣on of Christ to Paul Acts 9. to prooue that Christ his bo∣die (de facto) that is, actually, hath beene in two places at once, but hee can neuer from thence euince it, either by plaine euidence, or good consequent; doubtlesse that ap∣parision was from heauen, Christ still being in heauen, and it was extraordinarie, and we are to hold it for a truth, that Christ is now in heauen hid from the eies of all that liue on the earth: and let vs make this vse of it. Seeing it is so, that Christ is hid from our bodilie eie,  let vs labour to see him with a spirituall eie, euen with the eie of faith, as the Apostle Pet. 1. Epist. 1.8. saith,We must la∣bour to see Christ now hid from our bodily eies with a spiritu∣all eie of faith. Labour that we may beleeue in him though we see him not. Now because euerie one will thinke with himselfe, surely this lesson is soone learned, though I see not Christ with my bodilie eie, yet I doe eie, and looke on him by faith, and heerein the Deuill doth delude many a poore soule, making it thinke it doth eie Christ by faith, when indeed it doth not, that we be not therefore heerein deceiued. We must know that we are to eie Christ by faith,How we are to eie Christ by faith. as hee is set before vs to bee looked on in the word and Sacra∣ments, for so is Christ the proper obiect of faith, wee are to looke on him by faith as as a perfect mediator, God and man in one person, and so to eie the vertue and sufficiency of his meritorious obedience both actiue and passiue, e∣uen the merit both of his fulfilling of the Law in his life,
and of his suffering the cursed death of the Crosse, for this is Christ propounded, and set before vs to bee looked on in the word and Sacraments, many an ignorant person thinks hee doth eie Christ by faith, when hee hath one∣lie a generall and confused notion of Christ, hee liuing in the bosomc of the Church cannot choose but heare of Christ, but he hath no vnderstanding of the per∣sonall vnion of his Godhead and manhood, and hee is not able to distinguish betweene his actiue and passiue obedi∣ence, and he knowes not whence it is, that Christ his obe∣dience is of infinite merite and sufficiencie; well, thus are wee to eie Christ by faith, euen as a perfect media∣tor, God, and man, in one person; and so the infi∣nite value and merit of his obedience, both actiue and pa∣siue; and if we doe thus by faith eie Christ, without que∣stion, that is vnto vs a ground of liuely comfort, wee then see Christ, and in him vnspeakeable ioy and comfort, that curse of the Law, and condemnation remoued, our sinnes washed away in his bloud, and that wee in him haue right and title to all the comforts of the Saints of God in this life and for euer, and if we doe not thus see Christ to our com∣fort, certainely we shall one day see him to our euerlasting confusion. Come we now to the last words of this verse, wherein the Apostle doth expresse, in whom the happy life of true beleeuers is hid (namely) (in God) and before I come to that I chiefelie intend to stand on in handling of these words I hold it not amisse, vpon occasion of these words, to discouerA popish shift discouered. a shift that the Papists haue deuised to vphold their intercession of Saints, and their praiers to Saints de∣parted; they beeing pressed by vs after this manner, that to pray to them, is to ascribe vnto them, that which is proper to God alone, euen to know the hearts and in∣ward desires of men. They answer, that Saints in heauen do clearely behold God, and see him face to face, now (say they) God con∣taineth
all things in himselfe, yea the inward comfort that is in the hearts of true beleeuers in this life; and therefore, though Saints departed do not see the secrets of our hearts, as they are in our hearts, yet being present to the face of God, they doe behold in it all things, as it were in a most cleere glasse, this is their shift which indeed is a meere for∣gerie, and a vaine deuise of an idle braine, without all war∣rant of the word of God, wee finde it not in any place of Scripture, that the Saints in heauen, beholding God face to face, doe in him, as in a glasse see the comfort that is in the hearts of true beleeuers, which the Apostle here saith is in hid God, and other things said, or done on the earth, that conceit is contrarie to the Scripture which teacheth that God alone searcheth the hearts, and secret thoughts of men, and we finde that the Angels who he hold the face of God in heauen, are notwithstanding ignorant of many things, as of the wisdome of God, in calling and sauing the Gentiles, Ephes. 3.10. and of the day of Iudgement, and they know not the thoughts of mens hearts, vnlesse it please God by speciall dispensation to reueale them vnto them, the Lord vsing their ministrie for the good of his chosen, much lesse doe Saints departed know them, whom the Lord neuer vseth as ministring Spirits, as hee doth the good Angels, and if Saints departed did, or might, know things done or said heere on the earth, as well as God, yet it followes not, that therefore we should pray to them, ha∣uing neither commandement, nor promise, nor example in Scripture, to warrant such kinde of praier; wee see then that this is but a meere shift of the Papists to blinde the world withall, that the Saints in heauen behold the face of God, and in him see all things, and that therefore we may pray to them. Now in that the Apostle saith, that the life of true beleeuers is hid in God, wee are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That the happinesse and comfort of true beleeuers,
begunne in this life to be made perfect in the life to come,The happines and comfort of true belee∣uers is laid vp in the grace, mercie, and power of God. and laide vp in the gracious and powerfull hand of God; it is hid in his grace, mercy, and power, for indeed it rest∣eth in the gracious promise of God, by his free promise they haue right vnto it, and hold it, and as the Apostle Peter saith, 1. Epist. 1.5. They are kept by the power of God through faith vnto saluation. Their eternall happinesse is kept for them, and they kept for it, and both of them by the power of God. And hence it is that God is said to bee the God of consolation, Rom. 15.5. as indeed the foun∣taine and storehouse of all true comfort: and hence it is, that the Apostle saith, 1. Tim. 6.16. That he onely hath im∣mortality, and dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto. He onely hath immortall and eternall life of glory in him∣selfe by nature and doth giue it to whom he will, and hee will giue it in time to all true beleeuers. Now this is of excellent vse. First, hence we are taught, where we are to seeke, and to looke for life, breathing and true comfort in time of any distresse,Wee are to seeke and to looke for life and true com∣fort in all our distresses at the hand of God. euen at the hand of God who onely hath it in his keeping, it is neither men nor Angels that of themselues can giue it vnto vs, but on∣lie God▪ Whither will a man that needs anything goe, but where he knowes supply is to bee had? If hee neede but water he will goe to the Well or Conduit: so we in time of sickenesse or any other distresse, standing in neede of comfort, are to goe to God, in whose hand is laid vp the happinesse, and comfort of all his children, and wee are by earnest supplication and praier, to sue for it at his hand, and then doubtlesse (if we be in the number of those, to whom his promise belongs) we shall not faile to obtaine it, through his promise, the Lord is become a voluntarie debter vnto vs, and our comfort being laide vp in his promise, and wee suing to him according to his promise, and resting our selues on his promise, we cannot misse of it in time of neede, and wee are not to doubt of it; for God is faithfull who hath made the promise, Heb. 10.23.
If God can be vnfaithfull, then doubt of comfort in time of need, but that is vnpossible that God should bee vnfaith∣full, therefore make no question of it, but wee shall find it in time of neede: and consider further with thy selfe, dost thou beleeue there is eternall happinesse, and comfort in heauen, laid vp for thee in the hand of the Lord? and wilt thou then doubt whether there be comfort for thee in his hand in time of this life, and in this world, or no? Oh let it be farre from thee, remember that God is faithfull, as the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 10.13. and will not suffer thee to be tried aboue thy strength, but will either inable thee to beare thy triall with comfort, or giue thee deliuerance out of it as shall be best for his glory, and thy good. Againe, is it so that the happinesse, and comfort of true  beleeuers is laid vp in the gracious hand of God.The happines and comfort of tue belee∣uers is in a sure hand being laid vp in the glorious hand of God. Then let vs know that it is kept most safe and sure; at the first God trusted man with his owne happinesse, and hee wittingly and willingly lost it, but now it is kept in the hand of God, and therefore it is most safe, as the Apostle saith, 2. Tim. 1.12. Hee is able to keepe that which is committed vnto him, &c. Yea, the happinesse, and true comfort of true belee∣uers is so safely kept in the hand of God, that neither the fraude nor force of the world, or the Deuill without, not the flesh within, can depriue them of it, though the deuill and his instruments, maliciously purpose by their vexati∣ons, to make Gods children miserable, yet can they nor do it, they cannot come neere their happines, it is not only hid from their eies that they cannot see it, to hurt it, but it is hid in God, whom they neither can, nor dare assault; yea that which Gods children hold it by, is hid from them euen the hope of true beleeuers, as an Ancre is cast within the vaile of heauen, Heb. 6.19. If then wee haue in vs the beginnings of heauenly life and comfort, let vs assure our selues, we shall neuer bee depriued of it, the fulnesse and perfection of that comfort is laid vp in the powerfull hand of God, and nothing is able to wrest or wring it out of his
hand, indeed if it were committed to our trust, and left in our hands, to hold or to loose, wee had iust cause (as the Papists teach) to doubt of the holding of it, but wee must remember, it is laid vp in the gracious hand of God, euen in the promise of God, who cannot lie, and it is built one the eternall loue of God from which nothing can de∣uide vs, Rom. 8.39. and vpon the vnchangeable decree of God, that stands fast for euermore, and therefore the assurance of eternall happinesse wrought in the hearts of true beleeuers, is built on a rocke which neuer shall be sha∣ken. VER. 4. When Christ which is our life shall appeare, then shall yee also appeare with him in glory. In this Verse our Apostle makes knowne to the Colos∣sians beleeuing in Christ, the time when their happy life, now hid in God, shall be fully reuealed (namely) At the appearance of the Lord Iesus when Christ shall appeare; then saith the Apostle, Shall yee also appeare with him in glory. Then shall your happy life appeare, and so hee doth pre∣uent a secret demand the Colossians might haue made; for they might haue said, you tell vs our happy life is hidde with Christ in God, but when shall we haue that life, and when shall it bee manifested, our Apostle answers, when Christ shall appeare, then it shall be manifested. Now this is not barely expounded, that at the appearance of Christ, their happy life shall appeare, but it is further ampli∣fied. 1 First, by a description of Christ. That he is the life of true beleeuers, When Christ which is our life shall appeare. 2 And then by a description of their state and condi∣tion, in respect of that happinesse and glory, that then shal be giuen them. That they shall then be inuested with it, and appeare
whith Christ most glorious: Then shall yee also appeare with him in glorie. Wee see then, the Apostle heere makes knowne the  time when the happinesse and glory of true beleeuers, shall bee manifested (namely) When Christ shall ap∣peare. And hee describes Christ to bee the life of true belee∣uers. And he sets downe the state of true beleeuers, in respect  of that glory that then shall be giuen them, that they then shall bee possessed of it, and appeare with Christ in glo∣rie. Come we now to the words of this verse, and first of these words (When Christ which is our life shall appeare.Interpre∣tation. (When) the originall word heere translated (When) hath an indefinite signification, it properly signifies, whensoe∣uer, at what time soeuer, sooner, or latter: (our life) the Apostle said before, yee are dead, and your life &c. and it might seeme hee should haue so continued his speech in the second person (Yee) but heere he changeth his tearme and saith (our life) meaning the life of vs Iewes, and of you Gentiles, when Christ the life of all beleeuers both Iewes and Gentiles (life) the word (life) is put by a Meto∣nimy, by an vsuall manner of speach in Scripture, for the Author and matter of spirituall and heauenly life, for it is Christ that is the efficient cause of our spirituall life, and in him it consisteth, and thus himselfe saith, Iohn 11.25. I am the resurrrection, and the life. That is, I am the author both of this life, and the life to come, I raise vp the body from death to life, I quicken in this life by the life of grace, and I giue eternall life in the world to come. (Shall appeare) that is, shall shew himselfe from heauen in his glory, as it is, Math. 25.31. shall come the second time in glorie to iudge the world, and thus doth the Apostle plain∣lie expound himselfe, 2. Tim. 4.8. where he saith, Hence∣foorth is laid vp for me the Crowne of righteousnesse, which the
Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day: that is at the day of iudgement, and then he addes further, and not vnto me onely, but vnto all them also that loue his appearing: where we see he makes Christ his comming to iudgement and his appearing all one, thus then we are to vnderstand these words, as if the Apostle had said: Whensoeuer Christ who is the author, and matter of the spirituall life of all true beleeuers, both of Iewes and Gentiles, shall shew himselfe from heauen in his glory to iudge the world, thcn shall yee also appeare with him in glory. First obserue we heere that the Apostle speaking of the appearance of Christ to iudgement, he speakes indefinit∣ly he doth not define the time, he sets not downe any cer∣taine day, moneth, yeare, or age, when Christ shall ap∣peare to iudgement, but he saith whensoeuer Christ shall appeare. Hence we are plainely taught thus much. That the time of Christ his comming to iudgement is to vs vncertaine,The time of Christs com∣ming to iudge¦ment is to vs vncertaine. no man can set downe the certane time of his appearance, no man knowes certanly when it shall bee, and for this we haue Christ his owne warrant. Matth. 24.36. Of that day and houre knoweth no man. Yea, hee adds further, Mark 13.32. Of that day and houre knoweth no man no, not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the Sonne him∣selfe, saue the Father. Which may be vnderstood, either as Christ is man, or as he was then in the state of humiliation in the forme of a seruant, howsoeuer wee vnderstand it, hence it is cleare, that the day and time of Christ his ap∣pearance to iudgement is vncertaine, both to men and  Angels, neither men, nor Angels, can define the certaine time of his comming to Iudgement. First therefore, we are not curiously to search into the time of Christ his comming to iudgement,Wee are not curiously to search into the time of Christ his comming to iudgement. howsoeuer by the foregoing signes of it beeing fulfilled, and come to passe, we may know it not to be farre off: yet we are not
to take on vs to know the certaine day, and houre, no, not the moneth, yeere, or age when Christ will come to iudge∣ment, that is not reuealed in the Scripture, and it is curio∣sitie to search into it. Againe it is so that the signe of Christ his comming to  iudgemnt is to vs vncertaine; then we are to liue in con∣tinuall expectance of it,Wee are to liue in conti∣nuall expe∣ctance of Christ his comming to iudgement. Note. and to follow the counsell of Christ, Luke 2.34. Euen to take heede to ourselues, lest that day come vpon vs at vnawares. Where by the way obserue, that the day of iudgement is like to surprise and come vn∣awares on them, that are giuen ouer to sensuall pleasures, or drowned in the cares of this life, but in regard of the vncertaine time of Christ his comming to iudgement, it concernes vs euery day to looke for it, and to make ac∣count of euery present day, as of the day of his comming. For as one saith well, the last day is therefore vnknowne, that wee might bee ready euery day, and howsoeuer wee cannot exactly make account of Christ his comming to the generall iudgement, yet wee may well reckon on the Lord commings vnto vs by death, and of the day of our particular iudgement, we may well reckon of that not to be farre of, we see the yongest and strongest come as soone to the graue as the weakest, and most aged, and let vs know that as death leaues vs, so shall iudgement finde vs. Saul,Note. Iudas, and Kain, died long since desperatly, and the Lord at his comming, shall finde them in the same state; and so it will be with thee, in what state soeuer thou diest, so shall the Lord finde thee at his comming to Iudgement, there∣fore make ready for death, make account of it euery houre. How is that will some say? I answer,  looke what thou wouldest do at the houre of thy death, if now thou wert gasping for breth on thy death bed, or diddest see the Lord Iesus comming in the clouds, doe that very same thing euery day; lift vp thine heart, and labour to bee assured of thine owne saluation, and
whatsoeuer thou dost doe it with such zeale and feruency, with such feare, with such sincerity of inward affection, as if foorthwith thou wert to yeeld vp the Ghost, and pre∣sume not thou on length of daies, doe not thou indent and make a couenant with death, as the Prophet saith of the wicked, Isai. 28.15. putting death farre from thee, and so grow to a deadnesse and senselesse security in sinne, Matth. 24.39. Our Sauiour makes deadnesse of heart one signe of the last iudgement, and doubtlesse it is a signe of particular iudgement, iminent and hanging ouer thine head, when thou art carelesse, and dost put that far from thee, which may suddenly come vpon thee, Gen. 19.14. Wee read that when Lots friends fleered and laughed at Lot, and thought with themselues Lot told them but some idle dreame of his owne head, then was iudgement hard at hand, and the Scripture doth much runne on this point that the day of the Lord shall come euen as a thef in the night, 1. Thes. 5.2.3. Therefore take thou heede o this deadnesse of heart, put not that farre from thee which may shortly fall vpon thee, remember that the Lords comming, either to generall or particular iudgement is to thee vncertaine, thou knowest not when it shall bee: liue then in continuall expectation of it; waite thou and bee euery day ready for the appearing of the Lord Iesus. In the next place wee are to obserue that which the A∣postle heere addes by way of description of Christ, he saith not simply when Christ shall appeare, but when Christ our life shall appeare: hence we are giuen to vnder∣stand thus much: That Christ is the life of all true beleeuers, euen of all that looke for his appearance to their comfort,Christ is the life of all that looke for his appearance to their cmfort. hee is the author, and matter, of their spirituall life. Now for the right conceiuing of this point, and the further setling of it in our vnderstanding  are to consider, how Christ is the author, and matter, of the spirituall life of true belee∣uers;
and to this purpose know that Christ is the author of spiriuall life, as the roote of it, hauing it himselfe, and conueying it to all that beleeue in him; hence is he said to be the true vine, and they the branches, Iohn 15.1. A∣gaine, he is not onely the author of spirituall life, as is God the Father, and the holy Ghost, but he is the matter of it, and in him it consisteth, because he only is the propitiati∣on for sinne, 1. Iohn 2.2. He only is the expiatory sacri∣fice for sin the cause of death, and in him is perfect righ∣teousnesse to life eternall, euen to the Iustification of life as the Apostle speakes, Rom. 5.18. Now if it be asked how this spirituall life is conueied from Christ to them that beleeue. I answer,  by vertue of that true and neere vnion that is betweene Christ and his members, they being truely vni∣ted to him by the bond of his Spirit, and by faith, euen flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, (for so must wee be one with Christ) we must as himsefe saith, Iohn 6.53. Eat his flesh, and drinke his bloud, before we can haue life abiding in vs; true beleeuers beeing thus truely vnited to Christ, Christ by his Spirit doth communicate first himselfe to them, and then both the merit of his death for remission of their sinnes, and of his actiue obedience for their right to life and saluation, and withall the power of his Spirit to quicken them to the life of grace in this world, and to raise vppe their bodies to the life of glory in the day of iudgement. Thus then are we to conceiue this point, true beleeuers being truely and neerely vnited to Christ, by the bond of his spirit, and by faith, Christ liues in them as a root in the branches, and by his Spirit doth communicate to them, both himselfe and all his merits, for remission of their sins; and perfect iustification, and also the power of his spirit to quicken them to the life of grace heere, and to raise vp their dead bodies to life euerlasting, happinesse, and glo∣rie in the life to come. And this Saint Iohn teacheth plain∣lie,
1 Iohn 5.11.12. God (saith he) hath giuen to vs eternal life & this life is in his son: hee that hath the son hath life, and he that hath not the son of God hath not life: Where he sheweth plainely that in Christ is life eternall, and as many as are one with him, haue Christ himselfe, and hauing him they haue that life that is in him, Christ is the author, and mat∣ter of their spirituall life. Let this be thought on to this purpose; Is it so that Christ is the life of all true beleeuers, euen of all that looke for his comming, and appearance to their comfort?They deceiue themselues who looke that Christ shall appeare to their com∣forts and yet finde hm not their life. then thinke on it and deceiue not thy selfe, if thou finde not Christ thy life, neuer looke that hee shall appeare to thy comfort, the Apostle saith not, when Christ shall appeare then shall wee also appeare with him in glory, but when Christ our life shall appeare, &c. and wee are to consider it, and hence to take knowledge of it, that they speake foolishly, who say, if I be appointed to life and saluation, I shall come to it howsoeuer I liue, that is a meere delusion of Satan; as God hath appointed the end, so hath hee ap∣pointed the meanes and way to come to that end, Christ himselfe fled from Herod Math. 2.14. and yet was he ap∣pointed of God to liue his time, which neither Herod nor any other could preuent, therefore they reason foolishly that so speake, and know it for a truth that Christ must be thy life, Christ must be the matter of thy spirituall life, and must liue in thee, Gal. 2.20. or else neuer looke thou for life and glory by him. Happily some will say, how shall I know that Christ liues in me. Thou shalt know it by the working of his spirit in thee, where the spirit of Christ is, he workes a purpose, and an inclination of heart to obey God in all his commande∣ments, euen a delight in the Law of God, Rom. 7.22. and a minde and disposition like to Christ Phil. 2.5. cheerefully to doe the will of God, and as willingly to seeke Gods glory, and the good of our brethren, as to eate when wee
are hungry, and to drinke when wee are thirsty, and hee workes a loue to Christ for himselfe, and of the members of Christ, euen because they are his members: 1. Iohn. 3.14. We know that we are translated from death vnto life, be∣cause we loue the brethren. If these things be in thee in some measure, then indeede Christ is thy life, and shall one day appeare to thy comfort; yea, Christ beeing thy life, that life can neuer bee abolished, Christ died once, and now liues foreuer. Therefore hauing Christ thy life take this for thy comfort, thou canst not but liue eternally: but on the contrary, if the things before spoken of be wanting in thee, then certainly thou must looke for no comfort by Christ at his comming, thou art in death, and shalt abide in death, and die eternally, and be damned in hell. One thing more is offered vnto vs from these words, in that the Apostle saith, (When Christ which is our life shall ap∣peare:) We are taught. That Christ in time shall certainely appeare to iudge the world in power and great glorie,Doctr. 3. Christ shall in time certaine∣lie appeare to iudge the world in po∣wer & great glory. hee shall appeare both God and an of infinite glory, attended with his mighty Angels, 2 Thes. 1.7. His glory shall bee such that the pow∣ers of heauen shall be shaken, Math. 24.29. Yea, the hea∣uens shall passe passe away with a noise, and the elements shall melt with heate, &c. 2 Peter 3.10 Seeing therefore such shall be the glorious appearance of Christ at his com∣ming to iudgement, what manner of persons ought we to be in holy conuersation and godlinesse. This vse the Apostle Peter makes of it, 2 Pet. 3.11.  Wee liue now in those daies the Apostle speaks of in that Chap∣ter Verse 3.4. Wherein wicked men walke after their own lusts,We are to stand in con∣tinuall awe of Christ his glo∣rious com∣ming to iudge¦ment. and say, where is the promise of his comming &c. and make euen a mocke at the day of iudgement, and feare not the glorious appearance of Christ, and heerein they are worse then the Deuill, who trembles at the remembrance of that day: well one day they shall tremble and quake, and bee ouerwhelmed with horror, and when Christ shall appeare
in glorie not bee able to endure the fire of his wrath, let as many as loue the Lord Iesus shake off security, and stand in continuall awe of his glorious comming, let our hearts be now smitten with a reuerent feare of it, and let vs pre∣pare to meet the Lord at his comming, that wee may bee able to stand before him with ioy, and there lift vppe our head because our redemption shall be at hand. Come we now to the description of the state of true be∣leeuers in respect of that happinesse and glory which they shall haue at the appearance of Christ in these words (then shall ye also appeare with him in glory) where the Apo∣stle doth shew that true beleeuers shall then bee possessed of that glory, and shall appeare with Christ most glorious, (then) this word hath relation to the words immediately going before (yee) that is,Interpreta∣tion. yee beleeuers who haue Christ your life, and we are to vnderstand that word as spoken of the persons of true beleeuers, not of their soules alone se∣parate from their bodies, nor of their bodies alone, then shall ye in your bodies and soules (appeare) that is, be ma∣nifestly seene of men and Angels (with him) namely with Christ (in glory) that is, most glorious inuested with eter∣nall and vnspeakable glory, thus then conceiue wee these worde, as if the Apostle had sayd. Then at the appearance of Christ, shall ye bee mani∣festly seene with Christ, inuested in your bodies and soules with eternall and vnspeakable glory. Now first in that the Apostle sayth, that at the appea¦rance of Christ, true beleeuers shall appeare with him in glory, we may easily conclude. Doct. 4. The happines and glory of true beleeuers shall one day appeare and and be seene of men and Angels.That the happinesse and glory of true beleeuers shall not alwaies bee hid, but it shall one day appeare euen to the whole world, yea both men and Angels shall one day, namely, at the day of iudgement, see the happinesse and glory of true beleeuers, and be eye-witnesses of the same, for why? the Lord Iesus at that day shall shew himselfe to the sight of men and Angels, in endlesse Maiesty and glo∣ry
in his owne person, and he shall at that day come to bee glorified in his Saints, and to bee made maruellous in all them that beleeue, so speakes the Apostle in plaine termes, 2. Thess. 1.10. at his comming he shall not onely bee infi∣nitely glorious in his owne person, but he shall also be glo∣rified in his Saints, he glorifying them, and they appearing with him in glory, therein they shall shew foorth his grace, his power and his goodnesse, and that to the astonishment & admiration of all that shall looke vpon them, euen to the amazement of men and Angels, Rom. 8.19. the Apostle in saying, that the creature, that is, the whole frame of the world, waiteth when the sonnes of God shall be reuealed: tea∣cheth also this poynt, that there shall be a time of reuelati∣on, there shall come a day, when the glory of Gods chil∣dren shall be reuealed to all the world, the reason of this is plaine, namely this. Because there must be a time,  when euen the most wic∣ked shall iustifie the goodnesse and mercy of God, in his dealing towards his children, and be conuinced of folly in themselues, now that is not in this world heere they looke on the troubles of Gods children, but see not their com∣forts, they, behold their present condition in affliction, but discerne not their happinesse, and so account their life folly and madnesse, therefore there must be a time when the happinesse and glory of Gods children shall be openly reuealed, and set before the eies of all the world, that euen the most wicked may looke on it, and (will they nill they) iustifie the goodnesse of God towards his children,  and be conuinced of folly in themselues,Comfort to true beleeuers that their beauty and glory shall one day bee made manifest to the view of the whole world. and bee forced to con∣fesse and say, Oh we fooles, thought their life folly and madnesse, but now we see they are deare in the sight of the Lord, and haue their portion among his Saints. Now then let this bee laid vp in the hearts of all true be∣leeuers, as a ground of great comfort to them, let them consider, that howsoeuer their beauty and glory is in this world obscured and ouershadowed, and it is not seene of
the world, it lies hid from the world, either vnder afflicti∣on, or vnder that excellent grace of humilitie, which the world accounts basenesse they walking humbly before the Lord, that humility of theirs is as a cloud to hide away their glory from the eye of the world, yet let them be pa∣tient for a time, and let them consider that it shall not al∣waies be hid, but the time shall come, when it shall euident∣ly appeare, and bee open to the view of the whole world, yea, the time shall come that men and Angels shall see it with admiration, yea which is most sweet and comfortable to bee thought on, euen they that heere haue turned their glory into shame, as Dauid saith: Psal. 4.2. that is, haue reproached them for their holy and religious carriage, and cast that in their teeth as a reproach, and loaded them with odious and fowle names euen in respect of that, the day shall come when they shall see that which now they ac∣count their shame crowned with glory, and shall be forced to chang their note and sing, a new song, yea, confessing their owne folly shall crie out, and say, we fooles thought their life base and full of dishonour, and now behold their vnspeakable brightnesse and glory, let this be remembred as a matter of sweet comfort to all Gods children, yea, let this encourage them euen to be more vile, as Dauid sayd, 2. Sam. 6.22. when Michl mocked him for dancing before the arke, I will yet be more vile then thus, so let all Gods chil∣dren be more vile, that is, more low in their owne eies, and walke more humby before the Lord, and so bee more base (as the world esteemes of them) and the time shall come, when they shall be had in honour of those that now con∣temne them, yea, those that now despise them (if they re∣pent not of that sinne) at the comming of the Lord Iesus, shall see them in glory, and shall be forced to acknowledge their glory to their owne euerlasting shame and confu∣sion. Wee are in the next place to obserue, that the Apostle saith not, then shall your soules, or then shall your bodies
appeare with him in glory, but then shall yee, euen yee, in your bodies and soules appeere with Christ in glory, hence we are taught: That there shall not be a perfect consummation of the  glorie of true beleeuers before the day of iudgement, true beleeuers shall not haue full accomplishment of glorie, be∣fore the second comming of Christ,The glory of true beleeuers shall not haue full accom∣plishment till the second comming of Christ. then shall they in their bodies and soules appeare with Christ in glorie, though the Saints of God now in heauen be blessed, Reu. 14.13. yet they looke for the perfection of their glorie, when their bodies shall be glorified together, with their soules at the generall iudgement: much is giuen to true beleeuers when they are dissolued, and goe to Christ, but most of all shall bee giuen them when they shall bee restored, and Christ come to them as Saint Iohn sayth, 1.3.2. when hee shall ap∣peare they shall be like him: not onely in their soules, but in their bodies also, the text is plaine, Phil. 3.21. hee shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like vnto his glo∣rious body: and then their bodies and soules ioyned toge∣ther, and glorified together must needes euen in reason make a full waight and measure of glorie: Reu. 6.0. wee read that the foules vnder the altar: cry how long Lord: as indeede expecting, and earnestly desiring the last iudge∣ment, when Christ shall glorifie himfelfe in executing ven∣geance on the enemies of his Church, and giue all his members glorie, both in their bodies and soules, and ther∣fore the Saints in heauen are in expectation of greater glorie. If anie obiect  against this, the example of Enoch and Eliah, that they in their bodies are alreadie in heauen, and therefore haue a perfect consummation of their glorie, and looke not for anie greater measure of glorie. I answer,  it may be doubted whether their bodies be now in Heauen or no, some make question of it, and hold that their bodies are not now in heauen, but either that the Lord who tooke them away hath laid them vp in such meanes as
are hid from vs, as he hid the body of Moses that the Diuell looking for it could not finde it, but to leaue that to be di∣scussed by better iudgement, admit it to be true, that Enoch and Elias are now glorified in heauen in their bodies, yet we must know that these examples are extraordinary, the Lord tooke them vp into heauen, that they might bee types and figures of Christ his ascention, and to nourish hope of life eternall in the Church, both before the Law, and vnder the Lawe, and therefore they make not against this, that the Saints in heauen, are yet in hope and expe∣ctation of full fruition of the promised glory, and this  meetes with the opinion of the Papists, who are not con∣tent to say that the Saints in heauen are blessed, but they giue them a full possession of blessednes,Confutation of the opinion of the Papists touching the blessednes of the Saints in Heauen. yea, they affirme that they are as highly exalted in heauen as the Angelles, grounding on that saying of Christ, Mat. 22.30. whereas indeed if wee looke vpon that place, and consider it well, wee shall finde it rather makes against them, for it is sayd, That the Saints shall bee as the Angels of God in heauen, but when; in the resurrection, at the generall resurrection, and not before; and againe it is not sayd, that after the resurre∣ction they shall be in euery respect like to the Angels, for then they shall bee without bodies as the Angels bee, but they shall be as the Angels, in that then they haue no need nor vse of marriage, that is the meaning of our Sauiour in that place, and so it makes nothing for the purpose of our aduersaries, to prooue that the Saints now in heauen are as highly exalted in honour as the Angels, and we are not to suffer our selues by this to be driuen from the truth, that the Saints in heauen though they be blessed, yet haue not obtained perfect consummation of glory, but doe expect it to be giuen at the day of iudgement, yea, the first mem∣ber of Christ that died many hundred yeeres agoe, shall receiue fulnesse of glorie in bodie and soule, till the last member be ready. And vpon this ground wee may lawfully praie that the
Lord Iesus would hasten his comming to Iudgement,We may law∣fully pray that the second comming of Christ may be hastened. and make perfect the glory of his Saints in heauen, and earth; mistake not my meaning, I say not, that wee may pray for the dead, but we may pray that the Lord would make an ende of the daies of sinne, that hee would hasten the coming of Christ, that he would giue vs deliuerance from all the miseries of this life: Rom. 8.23. and in his good time (his kingdome of grace beeing finished) giue ful∣nesse of glorie to all his Saints both in their bodies and soules. Obserue wee further that the Apostle saith not, (then shall ye appeare in glory) (but then shall yee appeare with him (namely) with Christ in glory) Hereby we are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That as Christ, and his members cannot bee deuided  one from another; so Christ his glory,Christ his glo¦rie & the glo∣ry of his mem∣bers goe to∣gether. and the glory of his members cannot be disioined, nor put asunder when Christ shall appeare in his glory, then shall also all true be∣leeuers bee seene with him shining in vnspeakable glory, with the ful manifestation of the glory of Christ, shall goe a full manifestation of the glory of all his members. The reason of this is giuen in the place aforesaid, 2 Thessal. 1.10. Because the glorification of the Saints,  euen of all true beleeuers pertaines to the glory of Christ, and the one cannot be without the other. Now then, what an excellent comfort is this to as many  as finde themselues to haue part in Christ,Comfort to al that haue part in Christ they shall certaine∣lie appeare most glorious at the day of iudgement. no sooner shall Christ appeare in his but they also shall appeare with him most glorious, and indeed it cannot be otherwise, it is his will it should bee so, Iohn 17.24. that all his members should be with him where he is, and bee pertakers of his glory: can the head Christ Iesus raigne in endlesse glory, and his members be couered with shame and dishonour? It is not possible, remember it to thy comfort, if thou bee a member of Christ, his glory, and thy glory cannot bee
sundred, and know thou that it is as possible that Christ should not be glorious, as that thou shouldest not appeare in glory at the day of Iudgement. Now if any aske me what this glory shall be? I must answer  him, if I had the tong of men & Angels, I am not able to expresse it, the Apostle is faine to expresse it in generall tearmes, 2 Cor. 4.17. A most excellent, and an e∣ternall weight of glory. Yet certainly it shall not be equall to the glory of Christ, but like it, the text is plaine: 1. Iohn 3.2. When he shal appeare we shalbe like him. Phil. 3.21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may bee like vnto his most glorious body. The bodies of true beleeuers shal shine in glorie, like the glorious body of Christ, and they shall bee glorious in their measure according to his image, who is the God of glory, they shall then be decked and trimmed, as a Bride sutable, and fit for a most pure and glorious bridegroome, Reuel. 19.8. euen in the bright shining roabe of righteous∣nesse, and in most pure and perfect holinesse. Oh then, how ought this to affect our harts with a long∣ing desire after the comming of the Lord Iesus,Wee are ear∣nestly to long for Christ his comming to iudgement. that euen now we might see him comming in the cloudes; doe wee heare that no sooner Christ shal appeare, but we beleeuing in Christ shall appeare in glory like to him, and doe wee beleeue this? (If we beleeue it not, why come we to heare it) doe we then beleeue this to be true, and shall wee not long to see the truth of it? Indeed if that great glory spo∣ken of were vncertaine, or certaine glory but smal, it might be but small inducement to long after it; but seeing it is as sure that we shall haue glory as Christ himselfe the God of glory, and that an vnspeakeable weight of glory, shall not this quicken and stirre vp our spirits? Shall not this moue vs to long for the time when it shall bee reuealed? Surely if wee looke for our part of that eternall weight of glory, wee cannot but as feruently desire after it, and crie out with the Church, Reuel. 22.20. Come quickly Lord Iesus. And if thou hast not this longing in thee,Note. thine heart is
not right in thee, and if thy desire bee feeble, and weake, seeke to bee quickned, labour thou to haue a liuely hope to bee partaker of that glory that shall bee reuealed, and then thine heart shall be fild with aboundance of comfort, and thou shalt earnestly long for the appearance of the Lord Iesus. VER. 5. Mortifie therefore your members which are on the earth, fornication ncleanenesse, the in∣inordinate affection, euill concupiscence, and couetousnesse which is Idolatrie. Our Apostle hauing finished his exhortation, to seeke and affect things aboue, and vrged that on the Colossians, in the foure first verses, in this fift verse hee comes to his exhortation to Christian duties of the morall Law; and first he exhorts to duties required in the commandements of the second Table, from this verse to the end of the 15. and this exhortation stands on two parts. The first is to the mortification, and pulling away of such  vices and sins as are forbidden in the second Table, from this verse to the 12. And the second part is, to the putting on, and taking  to themselues such vertues as there are required, from verse 12. to the 16. Now the Apostles exhortation to the mortification of sinne, is againe two fold. The first is to the mortification of such sinnes as were  neere, and deare to themselues, and did properly belong to their owne pleasures and profits, and that is laid down, and vrged by certaine reasons in the 5.6.7. verses. The second is to the putting away of such sinnes as  did tend to the hurt of others, which likewise is pro∣pounded, and pressed by the Apostle in the 8.9.10. and 11. verses. To come then to this Verse, where the Apostle begins
his exhortation to the mortification of such sinnes as were deare to the Colossians, that this verse hath reference, and respect to precedent matter, it is cleare by the note of in∣ference (therefore) mortifie therefore. Now this inference is on this manner, the Apostle verse 4. laid before the Colossians, that at the appearance of Christ to iudgement, they beleeuing in Christ should cer∣tainly appeare with him in glory. Heereupon euen on this promise of glory, he doth inferre this exhortation. Morti∣fie therefore your members, &c. As if he had said you haue the promise of glory, and you certainely looke to be glo∣rified with Christ at his appearance, therefore you ought to labour, that (if it bee possible) you may bee found of him without spot of sinne, and to that end, you are to mortifie the body of sinne, and all the members of it; that is the dependance of this verse with that which goeth be∣fore. In this verse considered by it selfe, wee haue laid be∣fore vs. First, a generall exhortation to mortifie sinne, which sin is heere set downe by a comparison vnder the name of a body, and the members of a body. And it is further am∣plified by the qualitie of those members, that they are ter∣rene and earthly members. (Mortifie therefore your mem∣bers which are on the earth.) Then secondly, wee haue in this verse, a particular e∣numeration of those members, and especially of those members of sinne, that were rise among the Colossians, when the Apostle writ this Epistle, therefore hee saith, Mortifie your members, &c. And then comes to reckon them vp; fiue in number. (Namely)— Fornication. Ʋncleanenesse. Inordinate affection Euill Concupiscence. and Couetousnesse.
To which he addes by way of disswation, and to set out the ouglinesse of that sinne, that it is Idolatry. Come we to the words as they are laid downe by the Apostle, and first of the generall exhortation, Mortifie therefore your members which are on the earth. The word (Mortifie) is Metaphoricall,Interpre∣tation. it is borrowed from Chirurgions who when they must of necessitie cut off some part of a mans body (as in some diseases they must, then they vse to lay plasters to that part that is ill infected, and to bee cut off, to mortifie it, that is, to make it dead without sense and feeling, that it may be cut off with as lit∣tle paine to the party as may be, from this manner of dea∣ling is the word heere borrowed and taken, and the mea∣ning of the Apostle in saying, (Mortifie) is this, doe as Chirurgians doe in some cases, vse all good meanes to be∣nūme, to take away life from our earthly members to kill them, and to make them no more able to stirre then mem∣bers mortified; yea, no more then a dead karcasse, for so doth the originall word signifie. (Your members) that is, your sinnefull motions, lusts, and affections, for the cor∣ruption of nature is compared to a body, Chap. 2.11. and the motions, lusts, and affections, that arise from them, are as members of that monstrous body, and therefore are called members by the Apostle; and againe, they are said to be as members, because being not mortified they haue force in all the members of the body to bring foorth sinne, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 7.5. The motions of sinne haue force in our members to bring foorth fruit vnto death. Yea, those motions and lusts that issue out from naturall cor∣ruption, beeing not mortified, they runne through the whole body, and soule, and doe fill all the powers of the soule, and al the parts of the body with sin, and therefore they are called members (which are one the earth) that is earthly, which tend onely to-earthly pleasures, and shall
neuer be admitted into the kingdome of heauen as it is, Reuel. 21.27. Thus then, vnderstand we this exhortation, as if the A∣postle had said, doe you as Chyrurgians vse to doe, when they are of necessitie to cut off some member of a mans body, vse you all good meanes to benumme, yea, to kill, and to make dead your sinnefull motions, lusts, and affe∣ctions, which are as members of that body of natural cor∣ruption that is in you, and being not mortified haue force in all the powers of our soules, and in all the members of our bodies to bring foorth sinne, and tend onely to earth∣lie pleasures and profits, and shall neuer be admitted into the kingdome of heauen. Now heere, first obserue we the inference, and depen∣dance of this verse on the former, our Apostle hauing laid downe the certaine hope of glorie with Christ, that no sooner shall Christ appeare, but all that beleeue in him shall appeare with him in glory; we are to marke that hee presentlie subioines to this, the dutie of mortification, and saith, (Mortifie therefore your members, &c.) Hence we may take vp this point of doctrine. That hope of glory and mortification of sinne, must e∣uer goe together,Hope of glo∣rie and mor∣tification of sinne must euer goe to∣gether. the one of these must euer follow vpon the other, they must be vndeuided companions, as many as haue a certaine hope of glory in heauen, they must labour to quell, and kill the motions of sinnes in them∣selues. For why? that conclusion of speciall faith,The premises on which the conclusion of speciall faith is inferred. I shall bee saued, I certainly hope, and looke for glorie in heauen, is euer inferred on two other propositions. One is in the Scripture, and that is generall, (namely) this? Hee that repents, and forsakes his sinnes, and be∣leeues, and obeies the Gospell vnfainedly, shall bee sa∣ued. The other is the perpetuall, and constant testimony of conscience in such as are called (namely) this, I repent,
and forsake my sinnes, and I beleeue, and obey the Gos∣pell vnfainedly, on these two is euer that conclusion brought in. Therefore I shall bee saued, I doe assuredly looke for glorie in heauen; therefore (doubtlesse) mor∣tification of sinne, and hope of glory in heauen, must e∣uer goe together, they are not to be sundred. And let euerie one heereby examine himselfe,  and consider that this which I deliuer is a dutie.It is a vaine deceiuing hope of glory in heauen that is seuered frō mortification of sinne. Saint Iohn 1. epist. 3.3. deliuers positiuelie, and doth affirme it as a ge∣nerall truth that euery man that hath his hope in him pur∣geth himselfe. He saith in the verse before, wee know that when he shall appeare wee shall bee like him, and then hee brings in this generall proposition, Euery man that hath this hope in him, purgeth himselfe, euen as he is pure. That is, la∣bours to purge out all corruption of sinne, that he may be in some measure pure as Christ is pure. Let no man then flatter, and deceiue himselfe, with a vaine hope of heauenly glorie, for indeede it is but a vain and deceiuing hope that is seuered from mortification of sinne, if thou vndertake for the safetie of thy soule, and say, thou hopest to bee saued, and yet allow thy selfe in the pursuit of sinnefull pleasures and profits, euen seruing thine owne lust with delight, thou deceiuest thy selfe, thou hast no true hope of a better life after this life is ended; yea, I make no question of it, but I may iustlie appeale to thine owne conscience in this case, euen that will tell thee, that thou wallowing in sinne, and pleasing thy selfe in a course of sin, thou hast no certaine hope of comfort at the appearance of the Lord Iesus: thou that art a pro∣phane person, an epicure, a drunkard, and an vncleane person, or the like, and hast no care to mortifie sinne; doubtlesse thine owne heart can tell thee, that thou art so farre from taking comfort in remembrance of Christ his comming to iudgement, and wishing for his appearance, that thou art afraid of it, thou tremblest to think of it, thou thinkest if Christ shoul now come to iudgement, he should
come to trouble thee before the time, as the Deuils speake, Math. 28.29. What haue we to doe with thee, art thou come to torment vs before the time. I appeale to thine owne heart, whether this be not the verie thought of thine heart? with out question it is so in many; well let vs remember it, that hope of glorie in heauen, and mortification of sinne euer goe together, and he that hath that hope in him purgeth himselfe, and so farre as we haue preuailed in the mortifi∣cation of sinne, so farre we may be assured of a better life, and how farre we haue therein preuailed, may bee easilie knowne, because nothing is therein done without great re∣sistance of our corrupt and sinnefull nature. Let vs then heereby examine our selues touching our hope of glory in heauen. The next thing offered vnto vs in this exhortation is, the duty it selfe heere required by the Apostle (namely) mortification of sinne,True belee∣uers must la∣bour by all good meanes to mortifie sin in themselues. that true beleeuers labour by all good meanes to mortifie sinne, to benumme, and to make sinne dead in themselues. Now for the better conceiuing of this duty, I will first shew, 1 What mortification is. 2 Secondly, the meanes wee are to vse for the mor∣tifying of sinne. 3 And thrdly, the continuance of that dutie. First therefore, knowe that mortification is a worke of grace,What mortifi∣cation of sinne is. whereby we doe not onely curbe, and restraine the power and strength of our naturall corruption, and all the motions of it, but we abate, and weaken the strength of them, and by little and little doe kill and abolish the same. I say, a worke of grace, because it is not possible that na∣ture should euer goe about to mortifie sinne; nature doth neither see, nor feele corruption, but onely grace: againe, I say,Note. whereby we doe not onely restraine the power of our naturall corruption, and all the motions of it, for re∣straint of sinne, may be in some part in ciuill honest men,
endued onely with ciuill honesty, but wee abate the strength of sinne, and by little and little, doe kill and abo∣lish it; and thus is mortification set foorth to vs in many places of the Scripture, it is cald a mortifying of the olde man, Rom. 6.6. a crucifying of the flesh with the lusts and affections thereof. Gal. 5.24. If any aske how we shal know when the strength of na∣turall corruption is more then restrained,  euen weakned and abated in vs. I answer,  when it is not onely kept from breaking out into actull sinne, but the lusts that issue out of it are a bur∣den to vs, we hate and detest them, and growne vnder the burden of them, desiring to be deliuered from them as the Apostle cried out, Rom. 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death. Now the meanes whereby we may come thus to mor∣tifie sinne in vs are these.Means that are to be vsed to mortifie sin. The first is, faith applying to our selues Christ crucified,  faith whereby we beleeue that Christ was crucified for vs, and we crucified with Christ, Gal. 2.19. where this faith is, there is the power of Christ his death, euen that power that sustained Christ on the Crosse, to beare the guilt and punishment of our sinnes, and that power is also effectual to abolish the corruption of sinne in all his members, and it is indeed the power of his spirit, Rom. 8.13. The second meanes is a serious application of the word  of God, and especially of the comandements, and threat∣nings of God to our seuerall lusts and affections, hence is the word cald the sword of the Spirit, Ephes. 6.17. The third meanes is a carefull auoiding of all occasions  and meanes, that may stirrevp our corruptions, and the sinfull motions and lusts of our hearts. Iob saith, Iob 31.1. He made a couenant with his eies, &c. Now lastly,The continu∣ance of mor∣tification of sinne. we must know that this duty doth lye on vs till death, because the corruption of nature shall not bee vtterly vanquished, and abolished in any till death.
Thus then conceiue we this duty, we are by faith apply∣ing to our selues Christ crucified, and by serious applica∣tion of the commandements and threatnings of God to our seuerall lusts and affections, and by carefull auoidance of all occasions and meanes that may stirrevp our corrup∣tion, and the sinnefull motions and lusts of our hearts, to labor not only to bridle our naturall corruption and weak∣nesse, but to abate it, and this must be a continued action, we are to doe it so long as breath is in our bodies. Now this being so for the vse of it: First it may vnmaske and discouer many in the world, who thinke highly of themselues to be vnmortified persons,Many in the world disco∣uered to be vnmortified persons. are there not many who shrowd themselues vnder the couert of harmeles ho∣nesty? they deale truly, they do no bodie harme, they ab∣staine from all outragious behauiour (which I speake not against) but yet if they looke into themselues, they shall finde they cherish in their hearts naughty affections and damnable lusts of anger or pride, selfe-loue, selfe-conceit, couetousnesse, or the like, and these they neuer labour to suppresse and extinguish, no they nourish these with liking, and thinke themselues in very good case, in respect of their ciuill behauiour; well let such persons know that they are vnmortified, yea, take this with thee whosoeuer thou art, that doest blesse thy selfe in thy ciuill behauiour, and thinke on it, thy ciuill carriage without mortification of thy sinfull lusts and affections is no better in Gods sight then a glittering abomination, the like ciuill life was found in the verie Heathen, and it may be in one that neuer shall be saued, therefore thinke on it. And for further vse of this, let vs all be stirred vp to the practise of mortification,We are to practise the duty of mor∣tification. let vs labour not onelie to bridle our corruption, that it breake nor out, but to kill and to crucifie it, let vs neuer rest till we finde the first motions of it, a burden to vs, and that wee groane vnder that burden desiring to be deliuered, yea, let such as haue made some good proceeding in this duty still goe on, and more and
more mortifie the flesh with the lusts and affections of it, for euen the best haue hidden and vnknowen corruptions in them, as Dauid sayd, Psal. 19.12. and they must bee found out and mortified, and because we faile in this duty, the Lord himselfe sometimes takes the worke in hand,Note and he will crucifie our corruption by his chastisements, yea (if we obserue it) we shall finde, that the Lord sometimes will crosse vs euen in good courses for our secret corruption not mortified, as he ouerthrew the men of Israel, twice go∣ing to battell in a iust cause, and by the mouth of the Lord himselfe: Iudges 20. for their secret sinne, because they were not so humbled as they ought to haue beene, thus will the Lord deale with all that belong to him, let vs therefore, euen as many as haue begunne to mortifie sin, still goe on in that duty, labour we to finde out our lusts, yea the hidden corruption of our hearts, and by a true ap∣plication of Christ crucified to thine owne heart, by laying to it the commandements and threatnings of the word, and by carefull auoidance of all occasions, and means that may stirrevp thy corruption, labour to kill and crucifie sinne, and to this purpose remember the words of the A∣postle, Rom. 8.13. If ye liue after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye mortifie the deeds of the body by the spirit, ye shall liue: if wee please our selues in any corruption of the flesh, be it but an inward lust, and liue in it with pleasure, we shall die, but if we mortifie it, then we shall liue, mortification of sinne, is an infallible signe that we haue the spirit of life, and that we liue the life of grace in this world, and shall liue the life of glory heereafter. We are further to obserue how the Apostle heere sets out the obiect of mortification (namely) sinne, and the sinnefull motions of the heart, he saith not in plaine terms, mortifie your sinnefull motions, lusts and affections, but (mortifie your members) he cals their sinnefull motions, lusts and affections, their members, because indeed they are not onelie as members of that fowle bodie of our naturall cor∣ruption,
but because being not mortified, they haue force to bring forth sin in all the members of our bodies, & are to vs as our members. Hence we may raise two conclusions. The first is this, that sinnefull motions, lusts and affe∣ctions  not mortified, cleaue as neere to vs as the members of our bodies,Sinnefull lusts motions and affections not mortified, are as deare vnto vs as the mem∣bers of our bodies. and are as deare and neere to vs as anie of our members: hence it is that our Sauiour bids vs, Matth. 5.29. plucke out your right eye &c. not meaning that wee should do violence to our owne bodies, but that we should cut off, and cast from vs the dearest things we haue, if they cause vs to offend, and it may bee also vnderstood of that corruption and concupiscence that hath force in the eye and hand, which is therefore called by the name of the eie and hand, because it is as deare and tender vnto vs, as our eye or hand, Iob. 20.12 13. Zophar sets out this notablie, he saith, that wickednesse is sweet in the mouth of the wicked, he hides it vnder his tongue, hee fauours it, and will not forsake it, but keepes it close in his mouth. The reason of this is plaine (namely) this originall sinne and corruption hath taken hold of, and corrupted our ve∣ry nature, and the powers and faculties of our soules, so as we may truely say, that the nature, and the powers, and faculties of the soule of man are corrupted, nature and the powers of nature, and corruption cannot be seuered, and therefore it is, that the motions, lusts and affections that come from thence being not mortified, are as neere and deare vnto vs as the verie powers of our soules, or the parts and members of our bodies. First therefore this may teach vs how wee may come to know when our corrupt lusts and desires are mortified,How we may know when our corrupt lusts and de∣sires are mor∣tified. (namely) when they are not deare to vs, wee make not much of them, and they are not to vs as the members of our bodies, but as burdens, though they be in vs, and arise in our hearts, yet wee like them not, but euen hate and loath them, for indeed they may be in vs, yea, they may at some time bee violent in vs,Note. and ouercarrie vs to sinne,
and yet be in a measure mortified, it was Peters case, Gal. 2.12. he was ouercarried with his feare to withdraw him∣selfe from the Gentils, yet was Peter a man regenerate and mortified, and that sinne of his was a sinne of infirmity, for that indeed is a sinne of infirmity,What a sin of infirmity is. when a man regenerate carrying in his heart a purpose not to sinne, is notwithstan∣ding ouercarried by some great temptation, or violence of affection to sinne; euery wicked and prophane man will say, hee sinnes of infirmity, as the filthy fornicatour, the beastly drunkard, the common swearer, and the like, but it is not so, these persons sinne with all their hearts, and their sinne comes not from lust and affection, onely at sometime violent, but euer ruling and raigning in them, and so they sinne of purpose, not of infirmitie (but that by the way) let it be remembred, that the lusts and motions of sinne that are in vs, and doe sometimes ouercarry vs to sinne, are for all that in a measure mortified, when they are not deare vnto vs, but wee hate and detest them, and are wearie of them, and striue against them, and this I speake for the comfort of such as labour and groane vnde the bur∣den of their owne corruptions, yea, and sometimes are dri∣uen in respect of them, to make question of their state, whether they be the children of God or no, as sometimes this is their complaint, I desire in my heart to obey God, and to keepe faith and a good conscience in all things, but I finde that my nature is so wicked, and so re∣bellious, that I somtimes doubt I am not the child of God; well examine thy selfe by this, doest thou (finding thy re∣bellion) hate thy lust? doest thou euerie daie (humbling thy selfe before God) striue against it, and being ouercar∣ried by it to some sinne, doest thou recouer thy selfe by new repentance? if thou canst with good conscience say, thou doest this thou needst not to feare it, thou art a child of God, for marke what the Apostle sayth, Galat. 5.16. walke in the spirit, and yee shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, it is there made a priuiledge of Gods childe not to bee
altogether voide of the lusts of the flesh, but not to ful∣fill them, that is, not to accomplish them with loue, with pleasure, & with ful consent of will, if thou hate and detest the lusts that are in thee, if thou resist them and striue against them, if (being sometime ouercarried by them) thou recouer thy selfe by new, and speedy repen∣tance, certainely (remember it to thy comfort) they shall neuer be laid to thy charge, to thy condemnation. Againe is it so that our sinnefull motions, lusts, and af∣fections, not mortified, are as deare vnto vs, as the mem∣bers of our owne bodies, then let no man fancie to him∣selfe that he may at his owne time and pleasure mortifie, and kill any knowne corruption of his owne heart,It is a meere fancy that a man may when hee will mortifie the knowne cor∣ruption of his owne heart. it is a conceite running in the mindes of many, helped forward by strong delusion of Satan, that they may subdue, and ouercome their knowne sins and corruptions when they will, and they may at their pleasure ouercome their pride, their lust, their couetousnesse, and the like. Alas they are deceiued, they shall finde it will be as hard to do, as if they were to lay violent hands on their owne bodies, and to cut off a legge, or an arme, therefore let not any of our hearts be possessed with such deceiuing thoughts, Ierem. 23.23. Can the blacke-Moore change his skinne, or the Leopard his spots, then may they also doe good, that are accusto∣med to doe euill, the Prophet there shewes how hard a thing it is to breake of but a custome of sinne, euen as hard as to make a blacke Moore white, a thing in nature impos∣sible, now if custome which is but a second nature be so hard to be broken of, what may wee deeme nature it selfe to be, how hard a thing is it to abolish that corruption that is bred, and borne with vs, and is as deare vnto vs as any member of our bodies. Let no man then imagine that he can at his owne pleasure shake from him his olde sweet familiar sinne, and offer violence to his owne nature, and so pleasing himselfe in that fond and windy conceit, neglect the timely, and carefull vsing of the meanes of
mortification. Let vs so sone as euer we spie any corrupti∣on, any sinfull lust, or motion in our hearts, vse the meanes to kill the same, let vs not suffer it there to harbour, and rest, in hope heereafter to deale with it, and ouercome it, we shall finde worke enough at the first, and the longer we suffer it, the stronger and the more heard it will be to ouer∣master. Yea, let vs know, it is euen a iudgement of God vpon vs, if we suffer any known corruption in our hearts,Note. and vse not the meanes to mortifie it; for as there is no greater signe of Gods wrath, then when he suffers men to goe on, and thriue in sinne; so certainely it is his iudge∣ment vpon vs, when wee suffer a knowne sinne in our selues, and vse not the meanes to mortifie, and to ouer∣come it. Let vs therefore bee stirred vppe to a timely and carefull vsing of the meanes of mortification, so soone as euer we finde any sinne in our selues. The second conclusion may be thus gathered. In that the Apostle saith, (Mortifie your members. &c,) Meaning the sinnefull motions, lusts, and affections that are as the members of that monstrous body of sinne, and haue force in our members; hence wee may easily con∣clude thus much. That it is the inward lust, and corruption of the heart,  that doth infect all the members of the body with sinne,It is the in∣ward lust and corruption of the heart that infecteth all the members of the body with sinne. it is that which doth fill the eie with pride, and with adlu∣terie; so as the very looke of the eie is defiled, and the eie is full of Adultery: 2. Pet. 2.14. It is that which defileth the hand, and makes it lift vp to shed bloud, and by it the foote is defiled, and hastneth to mischiefe, by it the tongue is set on fire to blaspheme, to raile, to lie, and how∣soeuer the Apostle saith, Iam. 3.6. That the wicked tongue is set on fire of Hell, meaning by the Deuill, yet it makes not against this I now deliuer; because the Deuill could not vse the tongue of man, or any member of his body, as an instrument of sinne,Note. were it not for the corruption that is within man himselfe; the Deuill stirres vp that, and sends
that abroad into all the parts and members of the bodie. Math. 15.18. Our Sauiour teacheth plainely, that all de∣filement of man comes from within, euen from the heart, from the lust and corruption of the heart, that is the thing that doth defile the whole man. Now this being so, that from the lust and corruption of the heart, comes the infection and defilement of all the parts and members of the bodie with sinne: it behooues euerie one of vs to follow the counsell of Salomon, Prou. 4.2.3. To keepe our hearts with all diligence:We are chiefe∣lie to purge our hearts, & keepe them with all dili∣gence. and in the first place, to looke to the purging of our hearts from sinnefull motions, lusts, and affections: wouldest thou mortifie the lust, or pride that is in thine eie, thou must then labour to mortifie the lust that is in thy heart, which doth fil thine eie with lust, it is preposterous and in vaine to goe about to mortifie the sinne of thine hand, thy feet, &c. so long as thine her at is full of vnmortified motions and lusts, to in∣stance in one particular, it is to no purpose in respect of true mortification, to keepe backe thine hand from doing wrong to others, either by violence or fraude, if thou haue within thee the heart of Ahab, euen a secret liking of the goods of thy neighbour, tickling, and delighting thine heart, and causing thee to wish, Oh would such a house, or such a field were mine, for that rate of couetousnesse will at one time or other send foorth bitter fruits; looke therefore in the first place, to the mortification of the lust, and corruption of thine heart, if thou labour to mortifie the members of thy body, and not the members of that body of corruption that are in thee, which fill thine eies, thy hands, thy tongue, and all the members of thy body with sinne: the Lord may deale with thee proportiona∣blie, and iustly fasten his iudgement vpon thine heart, and giue thee vp to hardnesse and vnfeelingnesse of sinne; for it is iust with thee Lord wherein wee sinne, therein to pu∣nish vs. One thing yet remaines in this generall exhortation to
be considered (namely) the quality of the members of sinnes, that they are earthlie, we are to marke that the A∣postle saith not, which are hellish or deuillish, as he might, but which are earthly; he thought it sufficient to set out the vglinesse of sinfull motions, lusts, and affections, to say they are earthly. And indeed,Sinnefull mo∣tions of the heart are vgly and hatefull enough in that they are earthly. it is enough to make the sinnefull moti∣ons of our hearts vgly, and hatefull in the sight of God, and of good men; yea, in our owne eies, if wee bee chil∣dren of God, when wee finde they tend onely to earthly pleasures, it is enough to make vs hate and detest them, and desire to be freed from them, our Apostle could not speake of such motions in other men but with teares in his eies: Phil. 3.19. They minde earthly things: the motions of their mindes are earthly, and shall wee then speake and thinke of them in ourselues with delight? If we doe, wee are farre from the affection of the Apostle. And indeed,  when Gods children feele their hearts mo∣ued towards fornication, vncleanenesse, or the like, they thinke with themselues, these are but earthly and sensuall pleasures, and euen in that respect they labour to quel and kill such motions, and suffer them not to rest in their bo∣somes, because they are grosse and earthly,If we be Gods children wee cannot away with the sinnefull mo∣tions of our harts, because they are grosse and earthly. they cannot a∣way with them. Come we to the particular enumeration of the mem∣bers of sinne, which the Apostle exhorted the Colossians to mortifie, in the words following. (Namely) Fornication. Ʋncleanenesse. Inordinate affection Euill Concupiscence. and Couetousnesse. He reckons vp fiue particular sinnes, that are to be mor∣tified, the foure first are sinnes against the seuenth com∣mandement.
Fornication. Ʋncleanenesse. Inordinate affection. Euill Concupiscence. And the fifth is a sinne against the eighth. Couetousnesse. Before we come to speake of these sinnes, as they are laid downe in order; obserue the Apostles order, his ma∣ner of proceeding; from his generall exhortation to the mortification of sinne. He comes downe to particulars, he thought it not sufficient to say mortifie sinne, but hee de∣scendes to exhort to the mortification of such sins, as he knew were found among the Colossians, (as indeed, Forni∣cation was a sinne common among the Gentiles) and the Apostle doth bend his speach much against it in his other Epistles; yea we shall finde, he insisteth more largely, in condemning that sinne, then commonly hee doth, in any other sinne. Hence we are taught thus much. That sinne is not onely to be spoken against in general, but also in particular. Ministers and Preachers of the word are to bend their speach against particular sinnes,Preachers of the word are to speake a∣gainst particu∣lar sinnes. euen sinnes knowne to be amongst them, to whom they speake; and not onely to say, take heede of sinne, or flie from sinne, but to point out particular knowne sinnes that are found in them to whom they speake. Wee shall finde it to haue beene the practise of the Prophets and Teachers, from time to time. 2 Sam. 12.7. Nathan comes to Dauid, and tels him, He was the man, yea, he went further with him, and laid before him his particular sinne, and the greatnesse of it, bringing to his minde Gods mercy in his aduancement, his contempt of Gods goodnesse, and his closse and cunning dealing in committing his sinne from that verse to the 13. Thus Act. 2.23. the Apostle Peter tels the Iewes of their particular sinne, That they had crucified
Iesus of Nazareth, and to make them see the vglinesse of their sinne, he goes on, and sets before them the manner of Christ his apprehension, that they had taken him by the hands of wicked men, preordained as vessels of wrath to that purpose, and that they had crucified Iesus indeede, but that Iesus whom God had raised vppe from the dead, and by his right hand exalted to the highest heauens, and made both Lord and Christ. It were easie to shew this by many other examples, that the Preachers of the word, are not onely to deale against sinne in generall, but to descend to particulars, euen to sins known to bee in them to whom they speake. The reason is plaine, they are to labour to make men so to see sinne, that they may be humbled, and repent of it; and that will neuer bee effected by speaking against sinne in generall; euerie man will bee ready to put of that which is spoken in generall from himselfe to o∣thers, and therefore there must be a descending to parti∣cular sinnes knowne to be in them, to whom the Word is preached. First therefore, this giues warrant to the Ministers of  the word, to speake against particular known sinnes;Preachers of the Word haue warrant to speake a∣gainst particu∣lar sinnes. yea, it lies vpon vs that are Ministers as a dutie, we are to deale with sinne, as priuate men vse to speake of State-matters in generall termes, warily, and a farre of, lest they bee in∣tangled in their talke, but we are to strike at sinne in par∣ticular; yea, we are to discouer the peculiar vglinesse, and deformity of it, by the condition of the sinner, by the manner of doing it, and by circumstances of time, and plae, and if sinne be so set before such as are guilty, it will either by grace make their harts bleed for sorrow, as theirs did, Acts 2.37. or by corruption burst for anger as theirs did, Acts 7.54. Againe, is it so that the Preachers of the Word are to  deale against sinne not onely in generall, but in particular, then let no man thinke himselfe hrdly dealt withall, if
his particular knowne sinne,We are not to thinke them∣selues hardly dealt withall when their particular known sinnes are discouered by the prea∣ching of the word. be set before him in the prea∣ching of the word; it is commonly said, when a man re∣prooues a notorious sinne in any man, that he speakes a∣gainst that man, as if a man and his sin were al one, where∣as indeed the Preacher speakes not against the person, but against the sinne of the person, and if a man be somewhat vehement in speaking against a particular knowne sinne, according to the nature and quality of it, then he shall be charged with too much rigour, and he is too harsh and pe∣remptory, and that his words are not to bee borne; thus we manifest, and belch out the corruption of our owne hearts; yea, euen this is a particular sinne too common amongst many: we delight in such teachers, as come not neere vs, and in such as neuer touch our particular sinnes: if a man fill our heads with nouelties and strange conceits, he is the onely teacher for many of vs; as for him that comes home to our hearts, and sets our particular and per∣sonall sinnes before vs, we cannot away with him, we like not him but from the teeth outward. Let vs take know∣ledge of this to be the particular sinne of many of vs, and let vs be humbled for it; otherwise wee may iustly looke for the curse of God on our hearing, that as we delight in plausible nouelties, so the Lord in his iust iudgdment may suffer our heads to be fild with them, and keepe our hearts empty of all sauing comfort; yea, euen hide from vs the sweetnesse and comforts of his word. Come we now to speake of the sinnes heere reckoned vp by the Apostle that are to bee mortified, and first of these foure, Fornication. Ʋncleanenesse. Inordinate affection. Euill Concupiscence. Which are sinnes vnder one head, and all forbidden in the seuenth comandement, and of these I will not speake at large, for euery one of them might take vp a large dis∣course
but onely so much as is for the purpose of the pre∣sent text, which driues at the mortification of these sinnes. I will therefore: First, shew what these sinnes are seuerally, and the great∣nesse of them. And secondly, the meanes that are to bee vsed for the mortification of them, with application of the same. And after that, come to some generall doctrine that may be gathered from these words. First therefore know wee that (Fornication) is an out∣ward  breach of the seuenth commandement,What fornica∣tion is. and it is the carnall copulation of two single or vnmarried persons, e∣uen filthinesse committed by two persons vnmarried, and howsoeuer, this is not so great a sin as adultery, which is filthinesse committed betweene married persons, or at least one of them being married, yet is it a most greeuous sinne: 1. Corinth. 6. from verse 15. to the end,The greatnes of that sinne. our Apo∣stle doth there paynt out the greatnesse of it in liuely co∣lours, as that it takes the members of Christ, and makes them the members of an harlot, if defileth the body in more spe∣ciall manner then other sinnes, whence it is, that men and women are counted dishonest, if not only, yet chiefe∣ly for the sinne of fornication, it defileth the temple of the ho∣ly Ghost, and it prostituteth the bodies of men and women bought with a great price, euen the precious bloud of Christ, to most base and vile vses: adde to these the feare∣full effects and fruits of this sinne, which may also set out the greatnesse of it, it brings foorth a diseased bodie, a poore estate, and an ill name, yea, which is woorste of all, it makes both bodie and soule liable to the curse of God. 1. Corinth. 6.6. yea, not onely the body and soule of one, but of two at once, euen two at one time by this sin are enwrapped within compasse of Gods curse, and therefore doubtlesse fornication is a greeuous sinne.
Now the second sinne heere named is (vncleannesse)What vn∣cleannesse is. this sinne also is an outward breach of the seuenth comman∣dement, and by it we are to vnderstand, euerie actuall de∣filement of body against nature, as that of incest, with such as are within degrees forbidden, and laid foorth Leuit. 18. from verse 6. to the 18. and of other defilements which are more against nature, as that which is committed with another kinde, as with bruit beasts, expressely forbidden, Leuit. 18.23. or that which is committed with that sexe which is not for that naturall vse spoken of, Rom. 1.26.27. and was the sinne of Sodome, or that which is most vnna∣turall, and was in part the sinne of Onan, Gen. 38.9. now these defilements of the body are most foule and greeuous sinnes,The greatnes of that sinne. in that they are not onely against the Law of God, but against the verie light of nature, and be commonly pu∣nishments of some other horrible sinnes, and euer follow a very prophane and dead heart: Rom. 1.24. the Apostle sayth, when the Heathen turned the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man &c. God gaue them vppe to their hearts lusts: vnto vncleane∣nesse, &c. therefore all kinde of vncleannesse is a horrible sinne. What inordi∣nate affection is.The third sinne of the same kinde heere mentioned is the (inordinate affction) which is an inward breach of the seuenth commmandement, in the originall it is but one word , and heereby wee are to vnderstand the passion of lust, which boileth and burneth within, prouoking the bodie, and minde to vncleannesse, and this is that which the Apostle cals burning:The greatnes of this sinne. 1. Cor. 7.9. It is better to marry then to burne, that is, to haue within a continuall feruencie of lust, boiling and stirring to vncleannesse and fornicati∣on, and heerein may appeare the greatnesse of this sinne, in that it is a burning lust and affection, for being so, it not only hindereth good motions of the heart, but as fire doth consume all moisture of grace, yea where there is an heart enflamed, and burning with the passion of feruent lust,
that slame doth distract the minde, distemper the bodie, and disorder all holy actions, it is woorth marking that Peter saith, 2. Pet. 2.14. they that haue adulterous eyes, which are the messengers of that passion of lust, they cannot cease to sinne, therefore (without question) this inordinate affection, this passion of lust is a greeuous sinne. Now the last sinne of this kinde expressed,What euill concupi∣scence is. is Euill con∣cupiscence) which is also an inward breach of the seauenth commandement, and first the Apostle cals it (euill) to di∣stinguish it both from the desire of nature, of things seruing for the necessity of nature, as meat and drinke, which in it selfe is neither good nor ill, and also from the lust of the Spirit, spoken of Gal. 5.17. which is holy and good, and this euill concupiscence heere spoken of, is the inward motion of the heart to vncleannesse, with consent of will, it is the purpose and desire of the heart to any filthy act of adultery, called by our Sauiour the adultery of the heart: Matth. 5.28. he that looketh on a woman to lust after her,The greatnes of this sinne. that is, with a will and desire to her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart, now this is the mother and root of that burning lust, and they differ onely in degree one from another, this desire to any filthy acte of adul∣tery is the first degree of lust, and that passion of lust is a further degree, giuing no rest, but euer stirring to the com∣mitting of the filthy act of adultery, and therefore this desire of the heart to any filthy act of adulterie, beeing the mother of that feruent and boyling lust, and the grandmo∣ther of vncleannesse must needes be a great and a greeuous sinne. Hauing thus seene these sinnes what they are,Meanes that serue for the mortification of the forena∣med sinnes are foure. and the greatnesse of them, consider we in the next place, the spe∣ciall meanes that serue for the mortifying of them, which are chiefely these. First, the feare of God, that wee feare God in his word and commandement that forbids these sinnes, that feare will clense both the heart and body: Marriage indeed is a
meanes to auoide the act of filthinesse,Note. but it will not kill lust if this feare of God be wanting, this hath the promise, Eccles. 7.28. I finde more bitter then death, the woman whose heart is as nets and snares, and her hands as bands; he that is good before God, shall be deliuered from her, but the sinner shall bee taken by her. The second meanes is a true delight in the worde of God, and his holie ordinances, euerie man will haue his delight, if wee haue not spirituall delight, certainely, our hearts will be taken vp with fleshly and carnall delights, and therefore true delight in the word and ordinances of God is a speciall meanes to keepe out lust, Prou. 2.10. Salomon saith, when wisedome entreth into thine heart, and knowledge deligtheth thy soule, then verse 16. It shall deliuer thee from the strange woman, euen from the stranger that flattereth with her words. The third means is earnest praier to God, that he would purifie and purge our hearts, for he alone it is that must purge them from filthy lusts, and as one saith well, it is not possible that either that Christian, who is diligent in prayer should bee weake in grace to ouercome sinne, or that grace should abound where there is neglect of prayer. The fourth and last meanes is, auoidance of all things that stirre vp and nourish these lusts in our hearts, for take away food from the bodie, and it will languish and pine a∣way, so take away those things that stirre vp and nourish lust, and lust will be weakened and decay in vs, and those are, idlenesse, excesse in diet, curiosity, and excesse in trim∣ming the bodie with apparell, wanton speeches and ge∣stures, bad company and the like. Reproofe of such as vse not these meanes.If we now examine our selues by these means spoken of, it is to be feared we shall finde that many of vs are vnmor∣tified in respect of these sinnes, yea, euen such as will chal∣lenge to themselues that they are free from the filthie act of adultery, and not to stand on it, whether they feare the
Lord, or delight in his word, or vse prayer against these lusts, or no, doe not manie persons shew themselues vn∣mortified in regarde of these sinnes, in their light and wanton apparrell, in their newfangled and garish attire. They will say,  doe you know my heart whether I bee mortified or no. I answer thee, I take not on mee to know thine heart,  but by the fruits, can any thinke thee mortified to sinne within thine heart, when thou liuest to all vanitie and ex∣cesse without in thy body, must we iudge thee reformed in soule, who art vnreformed in body, and that thou art mortified to these sinnes, and yet regardest not the meanes of mortification, we haue no warrant so to thinke, & thou deceiuest thy selfe, if thou thinke thou art mortified to these sinnes. Now then that euerie one may be stirred vp carefully to vse the meanes that serue for the mortification of these sinnes. Let vs consider how farre they prouoke the Lord to wrath;A motiue to stirre vs vp to vse the means before spoken of. we shall finde they prouoke him not onelie to exe∣cute his vengeance on the parties themselues, that are guilty of them, giuing them vp in their soules to prophanenes, and plaguing them in their bodies, with fowle and filthie diseases, but they prouoke the Lord to execute his wrath on the place, and land where they liue, Leuit. 18.25. the Lord saith, the land is defiled by them, and shall vomit out her inhabitants, the words are of great vehemencie, and there∣fore our feare should be great, that wee prouoke not the Lord to such vengeance, wee ought to bee stirred vp to a carefull practise of the meanes, seruing for the mortifying of these sinnes. Come we to the third thing I propounded to stand vp∣on (namely) some generall doctrine, that may be gathered  from these words, and first in that the lust of fornication is to be mortified. We may gather.
That fornication is not a thing indifferent, or a matter of small moment,Fornication is not a thing in∣different or of smal moment and lightly to bee regarded, but it is a sinne, it is a breach of Gods Law, and that a great and fear∣full breach of it, this poynt I haue sufficiently made mani∣fest, onely remember that the Apostle in the 1. Corinth. 6. doth much insist on that, and condemnes it by many ar∣guments, and he cals it directly sinne, verse 18. Flee for∣nication, euery sinne that a man doth is without the bodie, but hee that committeth fornication sinneth against his owne bodie. Now thi wee are to holde for trueth, against whatsoe∣uer can bee said to the contrary, for indeede there is some∣thing sayd and obiected by some to the contrarie, euen against the plaine euidence of the worde, either in waie of extenuation of this sinne, or to prooue it to bee a thing indifferent. As first it is obiected, that the Lord bad Hosea the Pro∣phet Hos. 1.2. to take to him a wife of fornications, and there∣fore (say some) fornication is not simply euill, and in it selfe no sinne, for if it be (say they) then did the Lord com∣mand the Prophet to sinne. First, that can neuer be prooued to bee a historie, and a narration of a thing done, but a Propheticall vision. Againe, if wee grant it was a thing done, yet will it not follow thence, that the Lord commanded the Prophet to sinne, or that the Prophet sinned in so doing, because the Lord hath power to dispence with his Law, and may giue a speciall command for the doing of that which hee hath generally forbidden in his Law, and the Prophet beeing commanded might lawfully do it & not sin, yea, if he had not done it being commanded of the Lord he had sinned, as Abraham had sinned if he had not gone about to kill his sonne Isaac, being so commanded by the Lord, Gen 22. and the Israelites had sinned, if they had not spoiled the Aegyptians as they were commanded of the Lord, Exod. 11.2. though the fact of Abraham without the speciall commandement of the Lord, had beene murther, and the
fact of the Israelites had beene theft, therefore it makes no∣thing for the defence of fornication to prooue it no sinne▪ because the Prophet had a special commandement to take vnto him a wife of fornications. It is further obiected,  that fornication is reckoned vppe by the Apostles among things indifferent, Acts 15.29. the Apostles decreed that the Gentiles should abstaine from things offered to Idolles, and that that is strangled, which are things indifferent, and to these they ioyne fornication therefore say some, fornication is a thing indifferent. To this I answer,  it followes not that fornication is a thing indifferent, because it is ioyned with things indiffe∣rent in the decree of the Apostles, for their purpose was not in that decree to shew what things were indifferent, or what vnlawfull, but what things were most offensiue, and what thinges did chiefely trouble the churches, and offend the weake Iewes, and those were eating of bloud, and things strangled▪ and the fornication of the Gentiles; the Apostles afterward in their writings shew plainely their iudgement of those things, and wee finde they declare it lawfull to eat bloud and things strangled, but they simplie condemne fornication, therefore notwithstanding this, that fornication is reckoned vp with things indifferent, it remaines that fornication is in it selfe a sinne, yea a gree∣uous sinne. Therefore wickedly deale the Papists who tollerate and permit open whoredome,The wicked∣nesse of the Papists in tol∣lerating whoredome. the Pope alloweth the curte∣sants in Rome and other places at a rent to professe filthi∣nesse, yea, the Papists sticke not to say, and publish in their writings, that the stewes are for a common-wealth, and that in some persons fornication is better then marri∣age, which indeede is a doctrine of diuelles, and fetched from the pit of hell, what can bee more contradictorie to the Spirit of God, and to the plaine euidence of the Scripture. Oh but say they,  the stewes are tollerated for the a∣uoyding
of greater euills, as adulterie, incest, and the like. I answer them, cursed bee that remedie of sinne, that is sinne it selfe as Augustine sayth, God will not haue such a gaine to be recompenced with such a losse, and the Apo∣stle saith, Rom. 3.8. Some say, let vs doe ill, that good may come thereof, but marke what followes, their damnation is iust, euill must not be done, that good may come of it: we may see by this the shamelesse impudencie of the Papists, what wickednesse will not they defend, that so boldly plead for confessed filthinesse. But to come to our selues, is it so that fornication is simply euill,It ought to be farre from vs to account fornication but a trisling matter. and a greeuous sinne, then farre bee it from euerie one of vs to extenuate the matter, and to account of fornication but as a trifle, and as the world speakes, but a tricke of youth, shall wee esteeme that a trifle, and a tricke, that is repugnant to the eternall wisedome and iustice of God reuealed in his holy Word, that shuts out of the king∣dome of God, and opens hell mouth vpon vs, and makes vs subiect to the curse of God, to be euerlastingly tormen∣ted in bodie and soule in the fire of hell? farre bee it from euery one of vs, and certainely it is farre from all that haue any dramme of grace, and any conscience, or true feeling in them, they that esteeme fornication a small matter, and but a tricke of youth, the Diuell hath dulled their hearts, and that is come on them, the Prophet speakes of Hos. 4.11. whoredome, and wine, and new wine hath taken away their heart, euen their iudgement and vnderstanding, their con∣science and feeling; and therefore labour thou to esteeme of fornication, as it ought to bee esteemed, euen as a foule sinne and fearefull breach of Gods Law, and as a sinne that of it selfe brings foorth fearefull effects in this life, and in the life to come destruction of bodie and soule, and so account of the threatnings of God against it, as of cer∣taine executions, feare the plagues and iudgements de∣nounced against it, as presently to come, on the commit∣ting
of it, for if thou suffer Satan so farre to preuaile with thee, as to account fornication but a trifle, certainely then as it is, Prou. 7.22. thou wilt straight waies follow the har∣lot, as an oxe that goeth to the slaughter, and as a foole to the stockes for correction, not discerning whither thou goest, or what danger thou art like to fall into, therefore account of fornication as it is, and ought to bee accounted of, and learne to feare and auoyd it. In the next place obserue we, that the Apostle doth not only exhort to the mortification of lust, breaking out into the act of fornication or vncleannes, but to the mortifying also of the passion of lust, of inward burning, and of euill concupiscence, to the mortifying of the purpose, and de∣sire of the heart to any filthy acte of lust, hence wee may take vp this point. That wee are not onely to striue against the acte of  fornication or vncleannesse, but wee must also endeuour to subdue and ouercome the inward lust of our hearts,We must not onely striue a∣gainst the act of fornication but we must also labour to subdue the in∣ward lust of our hearts. wee must labour to stocke vppe the roote, and to drie vp the fountaine of all filthinesse, and euill concupiscence 1. Thessal. 4.3.4.5. the Apostle teacheth that our sancti∣fication according to the will of God standeth not onely in abstaining from the outward acte of fornication, but that euerie one of vs knowe howe to possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour, and not in the lust of concupi∣scence, that is, not in the inward burning lust, stirring vppe to filthinesse comming from euill concupiscence, as if hee had sayd, that is indeede true sanctification a∣greeable to the will of God, and pleasing to God, that is, throughout, outwardly in the bodie, keeping that pure and vndefiled, and inwardly in the heart, rooting out from thence, the lust of concupiscence, and therfore wee must not onely striue against the outward act of filthines, but labour to plucke vp the root, and to drie vp the foun∣taine of it. And there is reason for it,  for otherwise wee shall
labour but in vaine though we cut off the branches of lust; yet the root it selfe being still left in our hearts, certainely, they will spring and grow againe; therefore, in reason, we are not onely to abstaine from the act of filthynesse, but to mortifie the inward lusts of our hearts. And heerein many are much wanting if wee duly ex∣amine our selues in this behalfe,Reproofe of such as are wanting in this dutie. I am affraid many of our owne hearts will witnesse against vs, and condemne vs; doe not many, onely for their profit, or credits sake, either to auoide the danger of the Law of man, or shame of the world, or the like, abstaine from the act of fornication, and vncleannesse, and yet neuer striue against the inordi∣nate affection, and euill concupiscence, which they know to abound in their hearts, yea their owne hearts can tell them they nourish impure, and filthy lusts within, and yet they thinke all is well, so long as they are free from out∣ward filthynesse; yea, it may be some there bee, who are vnfit by reason of age, or debility of body, for the practise of (Fornication) who yet delight in seeing others wanton, and their hearts are tickled, and leape for ioy within them, when they see others runne madding after that sinne, in al wanton and vnseemely gestures, and they thinke that it is a matter of nothing, and they are in no danger at all in that respect: I feare me, that which I now speake sits neere ma∣ny persons, and they cannot auoid the dint of it, I appeale to their owne consciences, whether it bee not so with ma∣ny; and let such persons whose hearts are heerein guiltie, know, that they are farre from true mortification, and con∣sequently (as yet) farre from hope of saluation. There∣fore thinke on it it, whosoeuer thou art, that thinkest all is well, if thou abstaine from the act of fornication, or bee vnfit for the practise of of it, and yet doest harbour in thine heart known filthy lusts, and withal remember that thy in∣ward lust & concupiscence, is a breach of the commande∣ments of God, and that his eie doth see thy most secret fil∣thinesse, and will one day bring it to iudgement, Eccles. 12.
14. the eies of his glorie are so pure, as hee will not allow the least filthy conceit in thine heart, and therefore thinke it not sufficient to abstaine from the outward act of filthy∣nesse, but labour thou to mortifie, to kill, and crucifie the inward lust of thine heart, yea neuer rest vsing meanes to that purpose, till thine own conscience beare thee witnesse, thou hast in some good measure subdued and ouercome the same. One other general doctrine may be gathered from these words: In that the Apostle doth exhort to the mortifica∣tion of these sinnes, it shewes plainely. That wee by nature are prone to fall into them; and  herein is discouered vnto vs,So great is the corruption of nature that without Gods grace we are prone to vile monstrous, & vgly sinne. the great corruption of our nature, which without Gods grace is prone to such vile monstrous, and such vgly sinnes: I shewed the greatnesse of the corruption of nature in handling the 11. verse 2. Chap. in that it is a body of flesh; but heereby it may further appeare to vs, in that it shewes it selfe in so many foule sinnes of one kinde, and some of them so enormi∣ous, and monstrous, as they violate the very law of nature yea so great is the corruption of our nature, breaking out into these sinnes, that age will not abate the burning lust that issueth out from thence. May we not obserue it, that euen aged persons, whose bodies are decrepit and past the practise of vncleannesse, yet the fire of lust is still burning in their hearts, and lets loose their tongues to filthyinesse? Oh then the huge heape of corruption that is in our na∣ture; the Papists say, we aggrauate the filth of nature too much, O they stand on their pure naturals, but indeed the filth cannot be sufficiently spoken of, as one saith well,  an Angell cannot sufficiently point out the mysterie of sinne and filthinesse of nature.We are to take notice of the filthynesse of our nature, & to vse al good means to keep vs from soule and monstous sinne. Let vs take knowledge of it, and let it stirre vs vp to vse all good meanes, that may keepe vs from these sinnes, we haue the seed of al these sins within vs, and thinke not that age will mortifie thy lust, or that humane wit will keepe
thee from these sinnes, as some vse to say, Oh such a one is a iolly wise man, I maruell therefore, that he should so o∣uershoote himselfe, and fall into that sinne of fornication, implying thereby that humane wisdome is sufficient to keepe from filthynesse; no, no, thou art deceiued if thou so thinke. Dauid was no foole, and yet wee know hee fell into this sinne, yea consider it well, that Dauid when hee was somewhat growne in yeeres, and had also the remedy against it, yea, as those times suffered, many wiues, yet fell into the sinne of adulterie: therefore bee not thou secure, and thinke thy selfe safe, because thou art wise, or aged, or hast the remedy. No, no, thinke on the corruption of thy nature, and still vse all the good meanes that may keep thee from these sinnes. Labour thou to feare God in thine heart, and that his grace may sanctifie, and clense it from filthy lust, and when any vncleane conceit is cast into thy minde, speedily reiect it, bend thy minde another way, take in hand some businesse about which thou canst bee busie indeed, and call to God for strength, and then, no doubt, he will helpe thee to quench that fierie dart. Come wee now to the fift particular sinne, heere spe∣cified  (namely) Couetousnesse: (and Couetousnesse which is Idolatrie.) In speaking of this sinne, keeping my selfe still as neeere as I can, to the purpose of the Apostle. I will ob∣serue the order, I held in handling of the former sinnes. 1 As first, I will shew what Couetousnesse is. 2 Secondly, the greatnesse of that sinne. 3 Thirdly the meanes that are to be vsed for the mortification of it, with some application of the same. 5 And then come to some generall doctrine, that may be gathered from these words. First therefore, know wee, that (Couetousnesse) is an in∣ward breach of the eighth Commandement,What Coue∣tousnesse is it is the theft of the heart, as the Apostle Peter 2. epist. 2.14. saith of
wicked men, They haue hearts exercised with Couetousnesse. It may be thus brieflie described. It is an immoderate desire of hauing much, so the origi∣nall word heere vsed doth signifie, and wee are to vn∣derstand it, with a reference to outward riches. Now for the better conceiuing of the nature of this sin,  two questions are brieflie to be answered. First, it may bee demanded, whether there may bee a  moderate desire of outward wealth. Answere: there may,  for desire is a naturall affection and being towards any good thing, as riches are in them∣selues; it is lawfull, & good, when it is with due measure, and moderation, according to the nature of the thing de∣sired. Secondly it may be demanded: when is the desire of  outward wealth moderate? Answere:  when a man doth desire riches, as outward things and blessings, on the left hand, and not on the right, and doth desire onely such a measure of outward wealth, as the Lord in his wisdome knowes to bee meete and necessarie for him, both for the sustentation of nature, and the preseruation of his life, and for the maintenance of that lawfull state, condition, and dignitie in which hee is set. And this is warranted to vs by that praier of Agur, Prou. 30.8. Feede me with food conuenient for me: or with bread of my allowance; where we see that Agur praied to God, and desired of him that he might haue food of his allowance, (that is) the daily portion which God by his wisdome, and prouidence had cut out for him, both to sustaine his nature, and to further him in the seruice of God, and if we desire such a measure of outward riches, then is our desire moderate and lawful; and by this wee may further conceiue when our desire of riches is immo∣derate (namely) when we desire more outward wealth, then God sees necessarie for the preseruation of our liues, and the maintenance of our lawfull state, and condition,
and that immoderate desire of riches, is couetousnesse. The greatnes of this sinne.I might shew this to be a great sinne many waies, as that it is a sinne against God, a breach of his Law, it shuts out of the kingdom of God, but I will make it manifest by that which the Apostle doth heere subioine, that it is Idolatrie, adding to that one thing further. First therefore, Couetousnesse must needes bee a great sinne in that it is Idolatry, in that it is a spirituall Idolatry, and so not onely a sinne against the second Table, but a∣gainst the first also, in such sort, as he, or shee, that is pos∣sessed with it, is a spirituall Idolater, as the Apostle saith, Ephes. 5.5. which is said not onely in regard of the coue∣tous mans loue to riches, surpassing his loue to God (for so fornicators, and other sinners may also be said to be Ido∣laters) but in that respect which is more proper to this sin, which is, that couetous men put their trust in riches, which ought to be wholly put in God, and is a chiefe part of that holy and inward worship we owe vnto God. The ground of couetous∣nesse.For indeed the very ground of Couetousnesse, and of an insatiable desire of riches is this: men haue a false and foolish imagination, that wealth will bring some happi∣nesse, and that if they haue store of wealth, then they are in safty and happy case, and thereupon their desire of ri∣ches is inlarged, and they become exceeding greedy and insatiable, in desiring and seeking after them, and hauing abundance are still couetous, & so withdraw their hearts from the Lord, and trust to their riches, as to holdes most strong and mighty. Yea, many times couetous rich men so trust to their riches, as thereby in their conceit they secure themselues against calamities; they thinke themselues free from dan∣ger of famine, and many other afflictions; yea, we verifie this by a common speech of men, wee commonly vse to say of one that is wealthy. Oh, he cannot doe amisse, hee hath the world at will; as if we should say, hee is free from danger, no hurt can come to him, and this is vndoubtedly
true of all couetous persons, they make their goods their God, they place happinesse in them, and they rest on them as on a foundation most sure and stable, that which Iob saith in way of clearing himselfe, Iob 31.24. is doubtlesse true of all couetous persons, They make gold their hope, and say to the wedge of gold thou art my confidence. And hence it is that the Apostle requireth Timothy, 1. Tim. 6.17. to charge rich men that they trust not to their vncertaine riches, knowing that to be a common sinne of rich men, to trust to their riches, and thus is the couetous person an Idola∣ter, the Deuill setting vp in his heart, which ought to bee the Temple of God, the Idoll of riches, and so is co∣uetousnesse without question, a gteat and greeuous sinne. Yet in the second place, the greatnesse of this sinne will  further appeare to vs,The effects of couetousnesse if we consider the fearefull effects of it, 1. Timoth. 6.9. the Apostle saith, they that will be rich, they that haue an insatiable desire of riches, fall into temp∣tations, and suares, and into many foolish and noisome lusts, which drowne men in perdition and destruction, and Vers. 10. he shuts vp all in generall, that it is the very root of all euill, it is the mother of all mischiefe, which we are thus to vn∣derstand, that where this sinne of couetousnesse is, there sinne aboundeth: there is no euill that a couetous man will abstaine from, if it may further his gaine, neither will he willingly do any good that seemes contrary to his pro∣fit. Yea this sinne of couetousnesse it carries a man with a violent streame to sinne, euen against conscience; it made Ahab sicke till he had his desire, both Naboths vineyard, and his life; it set Iudas forward, against all sense, to sell his Master for thirtie peeces of siluer, and that after diuers admonitions; and whence come treacheries, and cruell murthers,, sometimes of Fathers and Mothers, but com∣monly from hence, the couetous hart is set on the booty, saying to it selfe, by this meanes, such an house, such land, or such a summe of money shall bee mine, and the heart
being set on that, it puts out all light of religion, of reason, and sometimes of nature it selfe. Yea further, which is worst of all, this sinne of couetousnesse, it brings a man or woman almost to an impossibilitie of repentance, and sal∣uation. It is almost impossible that a couetous person should be saued, Matth. 19.24. saith our Sauiour, It is easier for a Camel to goe through the eie of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God. (namely) A couetous rich man, the reason is giuen by our Sauiour in the expo∣sition of the Parable, Matth. 13.22. The couetous heart is taken vp with the cares of this world, and those choake the seed of the word, and hinder it from taking place in the heart, and so frustrate all meanes of repentance and saluation; and of this the Lord complained, Ezekiell 33.31. They come to thee (saith he) as people vse to come, and my people sit before thee, and heare thy words, but their heart go∣eth after couetousnesse. Their couteous hearts will not suffer them to profit by the preaching; therefore without que∣stion the sinne of couetousnesse, being such a roote of bit∣ternesse, and bringing foorth such cursed fruits must needes bee confessed in this respect also, to bee a great sinne. Meanes ser∣uing for the mortification of the sinne of couetousnesse are three. 1. Meanes.Come wee then to consider such meanes, for the mor∣tification of this foule sinne, the lust of couetousnesse. The speciall meanes that serue to that purpose, are chieflie three. The first is a due consideration of the insufficiency of riches in themselues, and of themselues to doe vs any good; for (as we haue heard) it is an imagination of some good, or happinesse to be found in riches, that sets the hart a worke to desire them excessiuely. Wee must therefore labour truely to vnderstand and consider the insufficien∣cy of them in themselues to do vs any good, that of them∣selues they are not able to doe vs good, as indeede they are not, our owne experience may teach vs so much; wee see sometimes a man pines away in the middest of plenty,
though he haue abundance of wealth, yet nothing is able to doe him good, vnlesse the Lord blesse it as a meanes of good vnto him, it is not all the wealth in the world; that of it selfe can helpe vs, or keepe away any iudgement of God from vs: Pro. 11.4. riches auaile not in the day of wrath: this we must labour to be perswaded of, and we shall finde it a notable meanes to expell out of our hearts the lust of co∣uetousnesse. The second means to this purpose is this: we are to con∣sider  that abundance of wealth giuen to vs vpon our gree∣dy and vnsatiable desire of it, is not only insufficient to do vs good, but hath the curse of God attending on it, for we sinned in so desiring it, and our sinnefull desire being sa∣tisfied, that abundance is giuen vnto vs in Gods wrath,Note. and not in his mercy, why then should we enlarge our hearts immoderately to desire wealth, which beeing giuen vpon that desire, hath the curse of God attending on it. The third meanes seruing for the mortification of the  lust of couetousnesse, is contentation, the holy Ghost saith, Hebr. 13.5. Let your conuersation bee without couetous∣nesse, and bee content with those things that yee haue) where hee makes an opposition betweene contentation and co∣uetousnesse. So that where contentation is, there can∣not bee couetousnesse. It is an excellent meanes to driue it out, wee must therefore labour for contentation, e∣uen to bee well pleased with that particular state, wherein the Lorde hath sette vs, and to esteeme it the best estate for vs, bee it better or bee it woorse, and to this end wee are to consider that nothing comes vn∣to vs, but by the good prouidence of God, and (wee bee∣ing his children) from the good and gracious hand of the Lord; and againe, that wee are lesse then the least of Gods mercies, as Iacob sayd, Genesis the thirty two, the tenth, that wee are vnworthie to drawe breath in the aire, and these thinges well considered, will settle our heartes with contentation, and will bee an excellent
meanes to root out the lust of couetousnesse. Hauing now seene this sinne of couetousnesse what it is, and the great∣nesse of it, that it is as the sin of idolatry, and that it brings foorth many fearefull effects, especially, that it brings al∣most an impossibilitie of repentance and saluation, it neer∣ly concernes euery one of vs, to look into our selues to see whether wee bee guilty of this sinne, or no? if we duly ex∣amine our selues,We are to ex∣amine our selues touch∣ing the sin of couetousnes. it is to bee feared that the most of our hearts will bee found infected with this sinne, our practise shewes it, what heauing and shouing is there for the things of this life? doe not such as be wealthy vse all meanes, both in buying and selling to keepe the poore still vnder? doe they not many times sweepe the market of a commodity, so that others that come after them, can finde nothing but the refuse, or be forced to buy at the worst hand? and what should I say of our fraudulent and deceitfull dealing, and our seeking and taking aduantage one against another for the enriching of our selues? doe not these things, and many more that might be brought, plainely shew that we are couetous. Obiect: I giue euery one his owne, and I take nothing but that the law giues me. This thou mayst doe, and yet be couetous, if thine hart be euer musing and thinking of riches, if it be thy greatest ioy when thou encreasest thy wealth, and thy greatest sor∣row when thou sufferest any losse in outward things, cer∣tainely thou art couetous; so that if we thorowly examine our selues, it is to bee feared that the most will bee found corrupted with this sinne of couetousnesse. Therefore we are to be stirred vp to vse the means, that serue for the mor∣tifying of it,Two motiues to stirre vs vp to vse meanes to mortifie the lust of co∣uetousnesse. and to this purpose consider wee onely two things. First this, thou mayest heare the word with ioy, and haue many good things in thee, yet if thine heart be pos∣sessed with couetousnesse, that will not suffer any grace to take rooting in thee, a croppe of corne will as soone thriue
on a waste mountaine, or in a thicke thornie hedge, as grace will growe in thine heart if that thou bee coue∣tous. Againe if thou care not for inward growth of grace, yet I am sure thou carest for the continuance of thy wealth, know therefore that couetousnesse will in time waste and consume it, one compares couetousnesse to a theefe, and sayth, it is in vaine for thee to locke vp thy riches, so long as thou hast within, the great theefe couetousnesse, and indeede the holy Ghost saith, Prou. 11.28. he that trusteth in his riches (as euery couetous person doth) hee shall fall: for besides his inability of standing, hee hath the hand of God to pursue him, and to push him downe, therefore cer∣tainely he shall fall, and his estate shall not continue, if not in his time, yet in his sonnes dayes, and wee shall finde it true, that hardly a third heire shall enioy the wealth of a couetous worldling, if then wee either regard the inwarde growth of grace, or the continuance of that welth we haue with comfort, let vs be stirred vppe to vse all good meanes seruing for the mortifying of the lust of couetousnesse, la∣bour thou rightly to consider the insufficiency of riches in themselues to doe thee good, and that riches being exces∣siuely desired, and so giuen vpon that desire they haue the curse of God attending vpon them, and withall, labour to bee contented with thy present estate, esteeming that the best estate for thee, as comming from the good proui∣dence of God, and that thou art lesse then any mercie of God vouchsafed vnto thee, that so thou mayest roote out of thine heart, the cursed lust of couetousnesse. Some generall doctrines remaine to bee gathered from these words. I will onely poynt at them. First, in that couetousnesse is heere condemned, we may gather. That hauing much is not condemned, but the immo∣derate  desire of hauing much, if God by his good hand cast
abundance of wealth on vs,The huing of much wealth is not vnlaw∣full, but the immoderate desire of ha∣uing much. wee neither desiring nor see∣king after it, wee may lawfully hold and vse it, wee finde many testimonies and examples in Scripture, warranting the hauing of much,) if God giue it) and the vsing of it, if wee vse it to Gods glory, and the good of our selues and others, and with moderation, not setting our hearts vpon it:  Psalm. 62.10. If riches encrease, sette not your heartes thereon.We are to moderate our desire of wealth and hauing much to vse it well. The second generall thing offered hence is this. Wee see heere, that there may bee idolatrie in respect of baser things then Saints or Angels,Idolatry may be in respect of baer things then Saints or Angels. and therefore that Popish distinction of  and  of worship and ser∣uice,  is but vaine and foolish, the Papists are not able to defend it. VER. 6. For the which things sakes, the wrath of God com∣meth on the children of disobedience. Confutation of a Popish distinction.Our Apostle hauing verse 5. laid before the Colossians his exhortation to mortifie sinne, and reckoned vp some particular sinnes, that they were to labour by all good meanes to mortifie in this sixth verse and in the seauenth following, he labours to strengthen his exhortation, and to vrge it vpon them, and that by two reasons. The first is layd downe in this sixth verse, and it is taken from the dangerous and fearefull effects, that the sinnes before specified bring foorth, namely this, that they draw downe the wrath of God on men, the reason may thus be framed, those sinnes that bring downe Gods wrath are to be mortified, but the sinnes before spoken of, bring downe the wrath of God, therfore they are to be mortified, & this reason is further enlarged, by expressing the persons on whom these sinnes bring downe the wrath of God (name∣ly) on the children of disobedience, and that is briefly the reference of this verse to the former,Interpre∣tation. and the summe of it. For the which things sakes &c. that is, for the which sinnes
sakes before spoken of (the wrath of God) by the wrath or anger of God, wee are to vnderstand the effects of his an∣ger, his punishments, plagues, and iudgements in this world, but especially the euerlasting torments in hell, for it is frequent and vsuall in Scripture, to put the anger, or wrath of God for the effects of his anger, Romans 2.5. the Apostle sayth, thou after thine hardnesse, and heart that cannot repent, heapest vppe wrath, that is, heapest vppe punishments, and iudgements, as it may plainely appeare in the words following, against the day of wrath, &c. that is, against the day of iudgement, when the Lorde shall execute his iust iudgement on the wicked, when the Lord Iesus shall say to them on the left hand, goe yee cursed into euerlasting fire, &c. (commeth) that is, certainely, and without all faile, seiseth and taketh hold on (the children of disobedience) this is a forme of speech often vsed in Scripture, it is an Hebraisme, and by it wee are to vnder∣stand such as are obstinate and wilfull in their disobedi∣ence, such as will not bee disswaded from sinne, nor yeeld to any diuine admonitions, that might draw them from sinne, but are as it were, made and framed of disobedi∣ence, and as it were, brought out of the wombe of will∣full rebellion, and therefore called children of disobedi∣ence, in one worde, by this manner of speech is meant, such as are disobedient, rebellious and refractarie in sinne, and will not yeelde to any good councell or admo∣nition, nor by any good meanes bee brought ro repen∣tance, thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of the Apostle, in the wordes of this verse, as if hee had sayd. For the which sinnes sakes before specified, the plagues, and iudgements of God in this life, and euerlasting tor∣ments in hell doe ceaze, and certainely take hold on such as are disobedient and rebellious, hard-hearted and impe∣nitent, and will not by any good meanes be brought to re∣pentance.
Now before we come to consider the matter of doctrin offered from the words themselues, obserue wee the argu∣ment of the Apostle, the reason he vseth to perswade to the mortifying of the sinnes before spoken of. Hee takes his argument from the effect of those sinnes, that these sinnes, and euery one of them not repented of, brings downe the wrath of God, and therefore they are to be mortified, the Apostle would haue the Colossians to consider the heauy wrath of God attending on those sinnes, and thereby to be mooued to the mortifytng of them, hence we may ga∣ther thus much. That a serious and due consideration of Gods wrath waiting on sinne,A serious consideration of Gods wrath that a∣bideth for sin euer goes be∣fore true re∣pentance for sinne. is a notable meanes to mooue men to re∣pentance, for mortification is one part of repentance, or I may thus deliuer the poynt grounded on this context, and other places of Scripture. A serious consideration of the heauy wrath of God and of our fearefull condemnation, that abideth for sinne, euer goes before true repentance for sinne. Neuer did any, nor shall any truely repent of any knowen sinne without a se∣rious consideration of the curse, and condemnation due to that sinne going before. The reason is plaine, true contrition of heart, must goe before true repentance,  these two may bee compared to the needle and the thred, contrition is as the needle pearcing the heart, and making way and entrance, then followes the thred of repentance, the heart must first bee humbled and broken for sinne, and then followes repen∣tance, now the heart is neuer truely humbled for sinne, till it be pressed with the greeuousnes of sinne, and the hea∣uy wrath of God due for the same, therefore certainely a serious consideration of the wrath of God against sinne, is euer the fore-runner of true repentance, wee may see it plainely in the example of the Iewes, Acts. 2.37. first they were pricked in their hearts, their hearts were com∣punct and wounded at the sight of their sinne, and of
the wrath of God due vnto it, and then in verse the 18, followes Peters councell, , repent, or amend your liues. This lets vs see,  that many deceiue themselues in respect of true repentance,Many deceiue themselues in respect of true repentance. they hold themselues truely repentant for their knowen sinnes, and will needs bee so accounted, and yet they can witnesse to themselues, that their hearts were neuer wounded with a consideration of Gods wrath, they neuer set themselues before the iudgement seat of the Lord, nor considered how greeuous a thing their sinne is, in the sight of God, and how displeasing to him, and what fearefull condemnation is due for the same. Happily they haue had a vanishing touch of heart for it, causing them to send foorth a naturall sigh or sob, and causing them to say they haue sinned, and they are sorrie for it, and they crie God mercie or the like, but their hearts were neuer truely pressed downe, and broken by the waight and burden of their sinnes, and with consideration of the fearefull wrath of God for the same. Out of question, I now speake that which manie of vs know to bee true in our selues, if wee deale truely with our selues, wee cannot denie it, let vs therefore not any longer deeeiue our selues, but learne this lesson, that a serious consideration of Gods heauie wrath due to sinne, euer goes before true repentance for sinne, and make vse of it, doest thou know thy sinne, and wouldest thou repent for it truely? then set thy selfe be∣fore the iudgement seat of God, and consider the greatnes of thy sinne, and what fearefull wrath and condemnation abideth thee for it, and let the law bee thy Schoolemaster, as the Apostle teacheth, Galath. 3.24. let it whippe and seourge thy naked conscience, shewing thee thy sinne, and the punishment due for the same, yea, neuer to rest till the consideration of thy sinne, and of the wrath of God, due to thy sinne, haue brought thee downe as it were to the gates of hell, and to an holy despaire in thy selfe, and then no doubt (if thou belong to God) Christ will
shew thee comfort, he will worke in thee true repentance, and giue thee strength against thy sinne, yea thou shalt be deliuered from the guilt and punishment of thy sinne, and from the power of it. Come wee now to the doctrine offered from the words themselues. First obserue wee in a word, briefely a different manner of speaking in Scripture,A different manner of speaking in Scripture. in respect of our holinesse, and sinne, wee reade heere, and in other places of Scripture, that for sinne comes wrath, but neuer shall we finde it said in Scripture, that for our holines, or good works comes life and saluation, the Apostle, Rom. 6.23. hauing sayd (that the wages of sinne is death) goes not on with his opposition, that the wages of righteousnesse is life, but hee changeth his tearmes, and sayeth, but the gift of God is eternall life. The reason is this, because sinne is perfectly euill, but our holinesse, or good workes, euen the best of them are good but in part: but I forbeare to speake further of that poynt. In that the Apostle sayth heere, that the sinnes before spoken of bring downe Gods wrath, no doubt his purpose was not onely to perswade the Colossians to mortifie them, but to worke in them a religious feare and care to auoyde them, for hauing the same sentence, Ephes. 5.6. and against the same sinnes, hee addes verse 7. bee  not therefore companions with them) the poynt hence offered is this.We are to feare and a∣uoyd all knowen sinne because of themselues they bring downe Gods wrath and iudgements vpon vs. We are to feare, & auoyd these, & all other known sins whatsoeuer, euen because of themselues they bring downe Gods wrath and iudgements, howsoeuer wee are princi∣pally to feare and auoyde sinne, euen because it is sinne, and displeasing to God, if there were no hell nor punish∣ment due vnto it, that is the true feare of Gods chil∣dren, yet wee may, and wee are in the second place, to feare sinne in respect of Gods wrath and iudge∣ments:
and hence it is, that the Apostle 2 Corinth. 5. ha∣uing made knowne, verse 10. That wee must all appeare be∣fore the iudgement seate of Christ. Verse 11. he saith, Know∣ing therefore the terrour of the Lord wee perswade men. Wee knowing how dreadfull shall bee the doome of wicked men at the day of iudgement, wee perswade men to auoid sinne; this feare was in uid, Psalm. 119.120. My flesh trembleth for feare of thee. Asid he addes further, I am a∣fraid of thy iudgements. Dauid had a religious feare of God, he feared God himselfe, he feared to offend him, and then in the second place hee stood in aw of his iudgements, and indeed such is the canker of our nature, that the most re∣generate haue neede to set before them the wrath and iudgements of God due to sinne, that euen in considera∣tion thereof they may be affraid of sinne. Let not then, such as truely feare God,  thinke them∣selues exempt from all feare of Gods wrath, and iudge∣ments,Gods childrē are not ex∣empt from all feare of Gods wrath and iudgements. though they are freed from the wrath of God by Christ, and doe feare God for his mercy, with a filiall and childe-like feare; yet that doth not exclude a feare of his iudgements to keepe vs from sinne, we are chieflie, and in the first place to feare and auoide sinne, euen because it is sinne, but in the second place, we are to feare the wrath of God against sinne; yea, wee are often, and diligently to ponder on the threatnings we finde in the Booke of God, against sinne, and to consider the execution of his wrath vpon impenitent sinners, and not to passe by the iudge∣ments of God, heard of, or seene in the world, but to lay them to heart, that thereby our hearts may bee still kept in the feare of God, and that wee may euer carry in vs, a reuerent awe of his great and glorious maiestie. Obserue wee further, that the Apostle heere speakes in the time present, he saith not, for which things sakes, the wrath of God hath come, or will come, but commeth; which implieth a continuall action, that the wrath of God ceaseth not to come on such, as liue in the sinnes before
named, or in any knowne sinne; yea, many times the wrath of God is on men liuing in this world, when they haue little or no apprehension of it; yea, therein is the wrath of God on them in most fearefull manner, in that they haue no sense nor feeling of it, striking them with blockishnesse and dulnesse of spirit, and hardnesse of hart, giuing them vp to a reprobate sorie so that hence we may conclude the certainty of Gods wrath. That his wrath faileth not to come on such as liue, and continue in knowne sinnes,Gods wrath faileth not to come on such as liue and continue in known sinnes. it is so certaine that the Lords wrath shall ceaze on them, that liue in knowne sinnes, as that they haue the earnest of it, and it hath already taken hold of them; and to this agreeth that speech of Christ, Iohn 3.36. He that beleeueth in the sonne hath euerlasting life, and he that obeieth not the sonne, shal not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. 2. Pet. 2.3. The Apostle saith, that the damnation of false teachers (sleepeth not) as if hee had said, their iudgement and damnation is comming, and shall certainely fall on them; and to that purpose our A∣postle speaks powerfully, Epes. 5.6. Let no man deceiue you with vaine wordes; for, for such things commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience, as if he had said, hap∣pily some will tell you, that fornicaiton &c. are no great sinnes, but humane slips and infirmities, and that they exclude not out of Gods kingdome, but let no man so de∣ceiue you, their wordes are but vaine, and deceitfull: learne you to know it for a certaine trueth, that for such things the wrath of God commeth vppon the children of disobedience. And for the vse of this, let it sinke into our hearts, and let vs be fully perswaded of it,We are, to be perswaded that Gods wrath shall certainly cōe on wicked and rebellious sin∣ners. that the wrath of God, his plagues and iudgements in this life, and fearefull torments in hell, shall most certainely come on wicked and rebel∣lious sinners, men are hardly brought to beleeue this, it will hardly sincke into their harts that their sinnes are so hainous as preachers would make them, and that Gods
iudgements doe so certainly abide for them; if they be∣leeue these things, would they liue in whoredome, drun∣kennesse, and other knowne sinnes as they doe? Would they liue in malice, and enuie? would they lie and slan∣der, raile, curse, and sweare, and commit all filthy abomi∣nations? Their liuing and pleasing themselues in these, and other like sinnes make it plaine, they beleeue not that Gods wrath certainly commeth on wicked and rebel∣lious sinners, they tremble not when Gods wrath and his iudgements are denounced. If one should now runne through the streets, and cry, fire, fire, our hearts would be suddenly smitten with feare; but let the Minister of God, stand, and crie, fire, fire, yea the fire of hell, which is kind∣led by the breath of the Lord, as the Prophet speakes, Isai 30.33. yet many of our hearts are nothing mooued, and that is a plaine euidence, we beleeue not that Gods wrath abideth for such sinnes? Well, let vs neuer rest till we bee fully perswaded of this, that so wee may seeke speedilie to make our peace with the Lord, and withall thinke on the greatnesse of his wrath: Nahum saith 1.6. before the face of his wrath none can abide, the mountaines tremble, the waters flee away, the rockes are rent in sunder, at the blast, or breath of his displeasure, and shall wee bee able to endure it? Thinke on it, and the Lord make vs wise to beleeue these things. Now, from this word (commeth) wherein the Apostle doth, as it it were, put a person on the wrath of God, and as it were, legs, and feet to walke vpon, I might shew that who by custome of sinne, and hardnesse of heart are so blockish that they see not Gods wrath in it selfe, shall one day without repentance so sensiblie see, and feele the same, as if it were a person doing execution on them, but that may be referd to the doctrine of the certainty of Gods wrath already deliuered: I passe by it and come to speake of the persons one whom the wrath of God commeth for the sinnes before named, and these are the children of dis∣obedience
(that is) as we haue heard, such as are obstinate in their sinnes, and will not yeeld to any good counsell or admonition, nor by any good meanes bee brought to re∣pentance. Obserue then, that the Apostle saith not, the wrath of God commeth on all whatsoeuer they bee that are guiltie of the sinnes before named, but he doth limit and bound his speach to the children of disobedience, the point hence offered is this. It is onely obstinacie in sinne that brings Gods wrath; It is not any of the sinnes before named,Onely obsti∣nacie in sinne brings Gods wrath. nor any other particular sinne whatsoeuer: but the lying in sin, and not repenting of it, that brings Gods wrath; when men, not∣withstanding all gracious admonitions, or fearefull threat∣nings, or other meanes that can be vsed, lie still in their sinne, and tie sinne to sinne, they make a way to Gods iudgement to fall vpon them, it is continuance in sinne without repentance that pulles downe the wrath of God. For why?  Gods mercie is greater then the greatest heape of sinne, and it is neither number, nor measure of sinne that doth condemne (for God might in iustice condemne for one only sinful thought) yet Gods mercie is promised, and belongs onely to repentant sinners; therefore it is not any particular sin, nor many sinnes together, but on∣lie obstinacy and continuance in sinne, liuing and dying in sinne without repentance, that brings iudgement and con∣demnation, euen the sinne against the holy Ghost is there∣fore vnpardonable, because it is impossible that they who fall into that sinne, should be renued by repentance, as the holy Ghost saith, Heb. 6.6. We reade Isay 1. that the Iewes were suncke deepe in rebellion, they were neither mooued by the Lord his benefits, nor by his punishments to amen∣dement, yet Ʋerse 16 the Prophet stirres them vp to re∣pentance, and saith, Wash you, make you cleane: take away the euill of your workes from before mine eies: cease to doe e∣uill. And then verse 18. Come now, and let vs reason together,
saith the Lord, though your sinnes were as crimson, they shall be made white as snow, though they were red like Skarlet they shall be as wooll: plainly teaching vs, that there is mercy with the Lord to true repentance for sinnes, how great soeuer they bee, and therefore it is a certaine truth that not any particular sinne, nor many sinnes, but onely continuance in sinne brings Gods wrath. Heere then for the vse of this, is a ground of exceeding  great comfort for such, as being guiltie of sin,Comfort for such as haue grace to re∣pent of their sinnes. haue grace to repent of it, such as being admonished of their sin are true∣lie humbled for it, as Dauid was, 2. Sa. 12. & as Iehoshaphat was, being told of his sin by Iehu, 2. Ch. 19.2. such as know∣ing their sin confesse, and bewaile it, turne from it, and for∣sake it, heere is comfort for them, they are not liable to the wrath of God for that sin; and if it be so, that after repen∣tance, they fal into the same againe of frailtie,Note. and against their purpose, yet if they recouer thēselues by repentance, and break of that sin by new, and speedy repentance, euen that sin committed after repentance, and againe repented of, makes them not subiect to Gods wrath; howsoeuer in∣deed such a sinne wil much weaken thy comfort, and thou shalt finde, thou hast iust cause to pray with Dauid, Psalm. 51.12. Restore to me the ioy of thy saluation. Yet certainelie take this for thy comfort, it shall neuer be laid to thy con∣demnation; for we may not imagine, that there is lesse mercy with the Lord who is the God of mercy, then hee requires of vs towards our brethren, now he hath enioined vs, Luke 17.4. That if a brother sin against vs seuen times in a day: which is not to be vnderstood of new offences only, but of all whatsoeuer, a certaine number being put for an vncertaine, euen all offences, or how often fallen into by frailtie, and seuen times turne againe vnto vs, and say, it repents me, wee must forgiue him, and shall the creature excell the creator in goodnesse and mercy? No, no, be as∣sured of it to thy comfort: if seuen times (that is) many times, thou sinne against God by frailtie, euen in the same
thing; and so often with weeping eies, and sobbing soule fall at his feet for mercie, there is grace, mercy, and par∣don with him to true repentance; but let no man heere∣upon presume, and turne this comfort into a licence to sinne, and wilfully heape sinne vpon sinne in hope of fu∣ture repentance; so doing, thou doest wrest, and peruert this comfort, and cast thy selfe vpon a dangerous point, for what knowest thou, whether euer thou shalt repent, or no; and take this with thee, though God haue promised mercie and forgiuenesse to true repentant sinners; yet he hath not promised repentance to euerie sinner, that euery one that sinnes shall repent, thou findest not that in any place of the Booke of God, therefore deceiue not thy selfe, take heede of such presumption and learne to make a right vse of the doctrine of comfort now deliuered; if thou haue grace to acknowledge thy knowne sinne, and to be trulie humbled for it, and to turne from it, though it haue beene often committed, yet there is mercie for thee with the Lord; yea sweete, and full of vnspeakeable comfort is it, that the Lord would haue his children so sure of the pardon of their sinnes, though they be many, whereof he giues them repentance, with a dislike, and true loathing of them, as he would haue it an article of their faith, so as they bee not sound Christians, if they beleeue not the remission of their sinnes, for which they are truely humbled; let not man sucke poison out of this sweetnes, and hence draw libertie to sinne, if he doe, he sauours this doctrine not to life and saluation, but to death, and to his  deeper damnation. Againe, is it so, that onely obstinacie in sinne brings Gods wrath, then it behoueth euerie one to take heede of obstinacie, and continuance in sin, and aboue all things in the world to auoid that as the greatest iudgement of God in this life:It concernes euerie one to take heede of obstinacie & continuance in sin, as the greatest iudge¦ment of God in this life. and to this end, wee are to take heede of custome in sinne, for custome in sinne takes away the sense and feeling of sinne, and many not obstinate in sin
at the first, yet yeelding to sinne, and continuing in it for a time, at length they become obstinate and hardned; yea, wee shall finde it a certaine truth,Note. that men first harden their owne hearts before the Lord come to harden them: they yeeld to sinne, and lie in sinne, and refuse to bee reformed, and then the Lord in his iust iudgement giues them ouer to sinne, and to the will of the De∣uill to bee ledde of him at his will, and then they become obstinate in their sinne. We read in the booke of Exodus (and it is woorth our marking) that Pharaoh many times hardened his owne heart before it bee said that the Lord hardened it, wee reade not that till Chap. 9.12. Therefore let euerie one of vs be admonished to take heede of continuing in any knowne sinne whatsoeuer it bee, learne thou to bee moo∣ued betimes, and often to bee mooued with conscience of thy known sinne, lest thou hardening thine own heart, the Lord also come to harden it, and then thy case is most fearefull, thou art then liable to the fearefull wrath of God in this life, and for euer in the life to come. Bcfore we leaue these words, one thing more is to bee obserued, and that is the Phrase, or forme of speech heere vsed by the Apostle, he saith not, on the reprobate, as hee might haue said, for onelie on them comes the eternall wrath of God: but hee saith, Or the children of disobedi∣ence? on such as are disobedient and rebellious in sinne, and will not by any good counsell, admonition, or other meanes be drawne from sinne: hence we are giuen to vn∣derstand thus much. That it is a fearefull thing to be wilfull in sinne,It is a feareful thing to bee wilfull in sin. still to  perseuere, and to goe one in sinne after many admoniti∣ons, and many threatnings vsed to the contrarie, to refuse all good admonitions, and threatnings against sinne; it is fearefull, it is a signe of reprobation, it is a signe that such persons as so doe, are appointed to euerlasting destructi∣on; vnderstand the point aright, I confesse there may bee
in the deare children of God a refusing, and a reiecting of the meanes of their good for a time, as they lying vnder some greeuous temptation, and despairing of Gods mercy for a time, may for a fitte refuse the meanes of comfort, and with Iob curse the day of their birth, and wish for death, Iob 3.11. Yea, the deare children of God may some∣times fall into sinne, whereof they are preadmonished, whereof they are warned afore to take heede; it was Da∣uids case, 2. Sam. 24. in numbring of the people, though hee was dutifully admonished by Ioab not to do it; yet he (pricked forward, with the pride of his owne heart) would needes in all haste haue the people numbred: and so the deare children of God may for a fit, through the violence of temptation, refuse good counsell, and the meanes of their good, and may notwithstanding forewarning, fall into sinne: therefore thus the point is to be conceiued of vs, that wilfullnesse in sinne, perseuerance, and going on in sinne, after many admonitions to the contrarie, is most dangerous, when it is with men as the Prophet speakes, Zachar. 7.11.12. That they refuse to hearken, and pull away the shoulder, and stoppe their eares, that they should not heare, and make their hearts as an Adamant stone &c. That is feare∣full, and that is more then a probable signe of their repro∣bation. And the reason is plaine, namely this, that is a resisting of the holy Ghost, as Stephen saith, Act. 7.51. a withstan∣ding of the Spirit of God in the ministrie of his messen∣gers, therefore that must needes bee a signe of reproba∣tion. Such then as after many admonitions, and threatnings, wilfully persist and perseuere in their knowne sinnes,Their case is fearefull who wilfully per∣sist in sin after many admo∣nitions to the contrary. may see in what fearefull state they stand; hast thou been often admonished of thy drunkennesse, thy whoredome, thy pride, thy swearing, thy Sabbath-breaking, or of any other sinne whatsoeuer? And dost thou still notwithstan∣ding such often admonition, wilfully perseuere, and con∣tinue
in thy sinne,; then know thou to thy terrour, that continuing of time in thy sinne seales vp vnto thee a feare∣full conclusion, it is more then probable, thou art in the state of reprobation, and in the number of such as shall be damned, thou art a childe of disobedience, and willfull re∣bellion, and therefore thou art not onely a childe of wrath as all are by nature, but it is more then likely, that thou shalt neuer be receiued to mercy, and that thou art a childe of perdition, and art now trotting apace towards hell, and shalt one day be fuell for the fire of hell, which is a fearefull condition to be thought on, euen with trembling, and if it be well considered, it is able to make thee (if hell haue not taken full possession of thee) to bethinke thy selfe of spee∣dy reformation, and therefore consider it, and let this ad∣monition now preuaile with thee to that purpose; if it do not, certainely, it shall one day bee a bill of enditement a∣gainst thee, to thy deeper condemnation, therfore thinke on it, and in time make vse of it. VER. 7. Wherein yee also walked once, when yee liued in them. In this verse our Apostle vseth another argument to enforce vppon the Colossians his exhortation to morti∣fie  the sinnes before named,The remem∣brance of our sinnes past, & now left, ought to worke in vs continuall sorrow for them, and a care more and more to mor∣tifie the lust of the flesh. the argument is from their former conuersation, that they in former times walked in those sinnes, and therefore nowe they ought to mor∣tifie them. Before wee come to stand on the words of this verse, consider wee this argument; In that the Apostle thus rea∣soneth, ye walked once in those sinnes, therefore now you are to mortifie them. Hence we are taught. That the remembrance of sinnes, wherein wee heereto∣fore liued, and nowe haue left, ought to profitte vs, it
must not be idle, but an effectuall argument to stirre vs vppe to the mortification of the flesh, it ought to worke in vs continuall sorrow for those sinnes, and a care more, and more, to kill and mortifie the lust and corruption of the flesh, Ephesians the fifth and the eighth, sayth the Apo∣stle, yee were once darkenesse, but are now light in the Lorde: walke as children of light. The argument there is the same that heere is vsed, that the remembrance of their former state, ought now to stirre them vp to a greater care of ho∣linesse. And thus ought it to bee with vs, and certainely, so it is withall Gods children. And therefore this may serue to warrant, and make good that position, that euen the sinnes of Gods children turne to their good,Gods children are bettered by their sinnes & to it ought to be with vs. they are bettered by their sinnes past, repented of and pardoned, the remembrance of them makes them more thankefull to God for his mercy, more humble and lowly in themselues, more milde and equall towards others, and more wary and circumspect ouer their liues, and stirres them to the mortifying of the flesh, heere∣by then trie thy selfe, if the remembrance of thy sinnes past be pleasing to thee, and thou canst take delight in the remembrance of them, that is a signe of a reprobate mind, and though thou beefreed from the practise of them, yet thou art not deliuered from the power of them, they are not yet repented of and pardoned, if thou wouldest bee sure that thy former sinnes are repented of and forgiuen, then labour thou for a sanctified remembrance of them, that thou mayst remember them with griefe and sorrow of heart, and be bettered by the remembrance of them, e∣uen thereby bee thou stirred vp to further mortification of the flesh, and to liue as much time as remaineth in the flesh, not after the lusts of men, but as the Apostle exhorts, 1. Pet. 4.2. after the will of God, and that will seale vppe to thy conscience assurance of the pardon of thy former sinne.
Come we now to stand on the words of this verse, they may be referred to two heads. 1 The first is an expressing of the former conuersation of the Colossians, in re∣spect of the sinnes before named, that they once in former times walked in those sinnes, wherein ye also walked once. 2 The second is, a specifying of time, when they walked in them, (namely) when they liued in them. Wheerein is also vnfolded the course of their walking in those sins namely, a life that was powerful in them, that when that life was powerful in them then they walked in those sinnes. I will open and vnfolde the sence and meaning of the wordes, (wherein) some render the wordes thus,Interpre∣tation. (among whom) with relation to the last words of the verse forego∣ing (the children of disobedience) but indeed it is more a∣greeable to the context, and to the argument, and purpose of the Apostle, to retaine this translation (wherin) with a reference to the sinnes before spoken of, and so the mea∣ning is in which sinne (ye also) that is, you Colossians now called as well as others (walked) this word is metaphoricall borrowed from passengers, or rather from such as walke in some place for pleasure and recreation, and so the Apostles meaning is, that they held on a course securely, and with delight in those sinnes (once) that is, sometimes heeretofore (when ye liued in them) heerein the Apostle hath respect to that which he hath often sayd before, that they were dead with Christ, and so his meaning in saying (when yee liued in them) is, when your naturall corruption as a kinde of life, gaue power and moouing for the exercise and practise of those sinnes, thus then briefely conceiue wee the mea∣ning
of the Apostle, in the words of this verse, as if hee had sayd. In which sinnes before named, you beleeuing Colossi∣ans, as well a others, held on your course securely heere∣tofore, euen when your naturall corruption was a liue in you, and gaue power, and moouing for the exercise and practise of those sinnes. The first thing heere to be marked is, that the Apostle sayth, that the Colossians also walked in the sinnes before named, signifying, that not onely the children of disobe∣dience, but euen they also as well as others before their cal∣ling, and conuersion walked in those sinnes? hence then we are taught. That the conuersation of Gods chosen, before their effectuall calling,The conuer∣sation of Gods chosen being yet vn∣called, differs not from the conuersation of the repro∣bate. differs not from the conuersation of the reprobate, it is as vicious as fowle, and as much defiled with sinne, as the life and conuersation of such as shall bee damned, Gods chosen beeing yet in their naturall state, walke on in sinne, and please themselues in the wayes of sinne, as much as they that are appointed to destruction, there is no difference betweene the life of the one and the other, till it please God by the powerfull woorke of his spirit and grace to make a separation and difference be∣tweene them, reade to this purpose, Ephes. 2.1..3. 1. Corinth. 6.11. Rom. 6.17.19. those places make this a cleare poynt. And the reason of it is manifest (namely) this, there is the same corruption of nature in the Elect and reprobate, and it is powerfull in them both, before effectuall calling,  and therefore before such calling, there is no difference betweene the conuersation of the one and the other.We may not iudge of the future and fi∣nall state of any man, by his present condition. On this ground then wee must learne to take heede, wee determine not of the finall state of any man, being as yet in his naturall state and condition, wee may not bee so bolde as to say, such a one is a reprobate, and a cast∣away; the life of Gods chosen before their calling
differs not from the life of the reprobate, therefore iudge not of the future and finall state of any man, by his present condition, wee may lawfully iudge a naturall and carnall man to bee so, and as yet to bee in a fearefull estate, e∣uen in the way to destruction, but to goe further then that, is to breake into Gods secret councell, what a na∣turall man may bee in after times, leaue that to the Lord. But I chiefely remember this doctrine to this end, to  stirre vp as many as are deliuered from their naturall con∣dition, to blesse God for that great benefit,Such as are deliuered from their na∣turall state, are to blesse God for that benefit. as many as are effectually called, are therein infinitely bound to magni∣fie the mercie of the Lord, before such calling, there was no difference betweene their life, and the life of the repro∣bate, they walkd on in the same broad way with them, they lay wallowing and pleasing themselues in the wayes of sin, and had no more minde to any thing that is good, then the vilest miscreant that liues in the world, and who hath made a difference between thee and a reprobate? who hath taken thee out of the way to hell, and set thy feete in the waye to life and saluation? only the Lord of his goodnesse, and by the power of his spirit and grace, and if thou well consider it, thou canst not be sufficiently thankefull to him for so great a mercy, when therefore thou doest see others (yet vncalled) pleasing themselues in a course of sinne, and powring out the rottennesse of their owne hearts and walking on the waies of sinne, thinke on it, and consider it, not to insult ouer them, but rather to pitty them, and thereby call to minde, what thou wast before the Lorde wrought on thee by his Spirit and grace, consider that thou seest in them, a liuely picture of thine owne former life, and meditate with thy selfe on this manner. Surely, such a one was I, so liued I once as these men now doe, I tooke as great pleasure in my sinne, as they now doe in theirs, and I ranne as fast towards hell as they now run; Oh then how much am I bound to the Lord for
his mercie towards me, who of his meere mercy hath tur∣ned my feete another way, and hath put a difference, and made a distinction betweene my life and theirs, what shall I render to the Lord for so great a mercy? this ought to be thy meditation in respect of thy effectuall calling, when thou seest others left still in their naturall state and con∣dition. Obserue in the next place, the word heere vsed (walked) wherein ye also walked, saith the Apostle, signifying that the Colossians before their calling, held on a continued course in their sinnes, securely with pleasure, as men walking and going in some pleasant way with delight. Heere then is layd before vs the property of such as are in their naturall condition they walke in sinne,Such as are in their naturall condition hold on a pur∣posed course in sin, and that with much delight in it. Obiect. Answ. they doe not simply sin, for fo do the most regenerate, but they hold a purposed course in sinne, and that with pleasure, and much delight. Happily some may say, such as are in their naturall con∣dition are dead in sinne, cap. 2.13. how then can they bee sayd to walke in sinne? is that possible? The answer is easie, these two things rightly conceiued may well stand together, there is no opposition betweene them, as there seemes to bee, for naturall men are sayd to be dead in sinne in respect of goodnesse, because they are so held vnder the power of sinne, as a dead man is vnder death, and haue no power at all to mooue towardes anie thing that is good. But they are said to walke in sinne, in respect of sinne, it selfe, and therein they haue liuely-hood and actiuitie, therein they haue not only a power to moue but doe actually mooue, stirre and exercise all the powers of their soules, and members of their bodies, wee are therefore to holde it for a trueth, that it is proper to men in their naturall condition to walke in sinne, to holde on a secure course in sinne with pleasure, such as are regene∣rate they fall sometimes into sinne, but it is one thing to fall into sinne, and another to walke in it, as it is one
thing of weakenesse to slippe, or fall into the mire, and another of purpose to walke in it, or to tumble in it after the manner of swine, or madde men, such is the diffe∣rence betweene the regenerate and vnregenerate,Difference betweene the regenerate & vnregenerate in respect of falling into sinne. the re∣generate of frailty, and against their purpose now and then fall into sinne, but such as are in their naturall condi∣tion, they hold on a continued course in sinne, they goe on with full purpose in sinne, and with pleasure adde sinne to sinne, and this the Apostle teacheth plainely, Ephes. 2.2.3. in his description of the naturall state of the Ephesi∣ans, he saith, they in their naturall condition walked in sinne, and then he shewes how, (namely) according to the course of this world, and after the maner of the children of dis∣obedience, in the lusts of their flesh, in fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others, and to this purpose speaks Iude, verse 18. they walke after their owne vngodly lusts: and then he shewes of whom he meaneth it, verse 19. euen of such as are fleshly, (that is meere naturall men, hauing not the spirit, hauing no dramme of sanctifying grace in them, noe doubt in speculation wee are well acquainted with this same poynt. Come we therefore to the vse of it. And first, this doctrine meetes with that errour of the  Papists, that a naturall man may prepare himselfe to re∣ceiue grace,That Popish errour confu∣ted, that a na∣turall man may prepare himselfe to re∣ceiue grace. wee shewed the follie of this conceit chap. 2.13. in that men by nature are dead in sinnes, it may hence also bee refuted, for how is it possible, that a man can pre∣pare himselfe to receiue grace, that is, running on with full purpose and consent of will another way, as euery na∣turall man is; it is as possible that a violent streame should suddainely turne backeward. If a man make himselfe readie to receiue grace, it must bee by his will, now the will of a naturall man is turned from God, and can follow nothing, but that which is euill and repugnant to Gods will, and therefore it is not possi∣ble,
that any naturall man should prepare himselfe to re∣ceiue grace. Let vs make vse of the poynt to our selues, and let vs consider the doctrine deliuered to this purpose,Triall of our selues, whe∣ther we be re∣generate or no. is it proper to men in their naturall condition, to walke in sinne, to holde on a course in sinne; then heereby exa∣mine thy selfe, heereby thou mayest know in what state thou standest, whether thou be regenerate, or as yet in thy naturall condition, if thou carrie in thee a constant pur∣pose not to sinne, and thy falling into sinne, is with a spi∣rituall striuing against it, and being fallen thou hast care to recouer thy selfe by speedy repentance, then comfort thy selfe, thou art regenerate, the seed of God is in thee, 1. Ioh. 3.9. but on the contrarie, if thou holde on a purposed course in sinne, if thou walke in it with delight, and sinne without any spirituall striuing against it, and adde sinne to sinne with pleasure, certainely thou art in thy naturall state, and hast no assurance of anie of the com∣forts of Gods children, I say without any spirituall striuing, and I woulde haue it obserued, I meane such striuing as is betweene the flesh and the spirit, betweene corruption and grace, for there may bee a striuing in a naturall man, betweene his naturall conscience, and his appetite, lust or affection, and heere wee may bee de∣ceiued. You will say, how shall wee know and discerne the one from the other. Answere, the difference is this, the striuing of natu∣rall conscience with lust, is a striuing betweene seue∣rall and distinct powers of the soule, but the striuing that is betweene corruption and grace, is in one and the same faculty, and power of the soule, the minde is car∣ried against it selfe, the will against it selfe, and a man may knowe hee hath this striuing in him, when
he doth not onelie in his iudgement disallow, but in his heart dislike that sinne, to which hee is naturally most in∣clined, when a man hath in him, not onely a checke of his conscience, but a true dislike in his heart of that sin, which his heart before loued, liked, and was most inclined vnto, when the heart is carried against it own liking, then is there a striuing betweene corruption and grace, for it must needes be a supernaturall power, and worke of grace that makes a man dislike, that which nature most liketh; heereby then trie thy selfe, if thou finde in thee this spiri∣tuall striuing against sinne, then doubtlesse thou art rege∣nerate, but if thy striuing that is in thee, bee onelie be∣tweene thy conscience, and thine appetite, lust, and affe∣ction, then certainelie thou art yet in the dregs of nature and art yet walking on in the way to hell, and so finding thy selfe, vse all good meanes to hasten out of that feare∣full condition. (When yee liued in them.) Obserue wee that the Apostle saith, that the Colossians walked in the sinnes before named (Whom they liued in them) when their naturall corruption, as a kinde of life, gaue power for the practise of them: hence wee plain∣lie see. That it is the life of our naturall corruption, that giues force to walke in sinne,The life and strength of naturall cor∣ruption is that which makes men walke in sinne. when our naturall corruption is liuely and strong in vs, then wee breake out into many foule actuall sinnes and transgressions. I hope this is a confessed truth, and for the vse of it, we must know that the cause of all sinne is in our selues,  our walking in sinne is from that life of corruption that is in our selues: Iames 1.14. Euery man is tempted,The cause therefore of all sin is in our selues. when hee is drawne away by his owne concupiscence. It is follie for thee to say as some doe, hauing runne on in a course of sinne a long time, and now happily being brought to some shame or punishment for it; woe to such a man, or such a wo∣man that euer I knew them: if I had not fallen into their
companie, I had neuer come to this; they might (indeed) be an occasion of thy sinne, and their sinne was great in so doing, but thine owne corruption caused thee to bee o∣uercome, and the cause of thy sinne resteth in thy selfe, and if we neuer saw ill example in all our life, yet our own hearts would teach vs to sinne; when therefore thou dost bewaile thy sinne wherein thou hast walked, looke thou goe downe to the roote of that, and all thy other sinnes, thy naturall corruption, and be humbled for that especial∣lie, as did Dauid, Psalm. 51. When he bewailed his adul∣terie, and murther, verse 5. hee went downe to the roote, and said, Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sinne hath my Mother conceiued me. Thus must wee doe in bewailing a∣ny knowne actuall sinne, for otherwise wee may bewaile our actuall known sinnes, through selfe-loue, feare of shame, or punishment, or the like, and so deceiue our selues therefore remember thou in bewailing thy actuall sinnes to goe downe to the cause of that, and all thy other sins, thy naturall corruption, and be chieflie humbled for that, and then no doubt thou shalt finde place to true repen∣tance, euen such repentance as goeth hand in hand with true faith, apprehending the merit of Christ his death for pardon of all thy sinnes. From these wordes a question may be mooued, in that the Apostle saith, they walked in sinne, when the life of corruption gaue power, and strength so to walk, the questi: on may be, whether after conuersion, and effectuall cal∣ling, naturall corruption be altogether dead, or no. The Papists answere affirmatiuely, that it is, but the truth is,Corruption of nature is not altoge∣ther dead in the regenerat, and why? it is not, it receiues a deadly wound at the first conuersion and effectuall calling, but it still remaines and brings foorth fruit till death: Rom. 6.12. Let not sin reigne in your mortall body, that yee should obey it in the lusts thereof: and the Lord will haue a remnant of naturall corruption to be in the most regenerate till death, that the sense of that, with griefe, and desire to bee loosed from it, may put
them in minde in what a miserable state they were when it was in full force in them, and so the spirituall life they haue gotten vnto them in Christ may be the sweeter, and that they may be stird vp to be more thankeful to God for the same. VER. 8. But now put yee away euen all these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnesse, cursed speaking, filthy speaking, out of your mouth. Our Apostle hauing exhorted the Colossians (as wee haue heard) to the mortification of such sinnes as did properly belong to their owne pleasures, and profits, propounding that exhortation, verse 5. and vrging it by two reasons in the 6. and 7. verses. In this eight verse hee comes to exhort them to the mortifying, and putting a∣way of such sinnes as did tend to the hurt of others, and this exhortation is propounded, pressed, and amplified by the Apostle in the 8.9.10. and 11. vers. That this 8. verse hath respect to that which went before, verse 7. it is plaine by the first words of it (But now) and the respect, and re∣ference is of the present time, and state of the Colossians to foregoing time, and to their former condition, whereby the Apostle takes occasion to presse on them his follow∣ing exhortation (namely) thus, that once in former times they walked in sinne, but now they ought to put it away. In this verse considered by it selfe, wee haue laid be∣fore  vs the Apostles exhortation, to put away sinne, ge∣nerally propounded, and amplified by speciall mention of the Colossians in these words (put ye away.) Then secondly, the Apostle comes to particular enu∣meration  of some sinnes which they were to put a∣way, and hee reckons vppe sixe in number, fiue in this verse
Wrath. Anger. Maliciousnesse. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. And one other in verse 9. (Lying) Lie not one to ano∣ther, &c. Come we to the words of this verse, and first of the ex∣hortation generally propounded in these words, (But now put yee away euen all these things.) Interpreta∣tion.(But now) In these words the Apostle (as wee haue heard) hath respect to that which went before, and his meaning is this, but now being conuerted, truely called, and wrought on by the spirit of God: (put away) The ori∣ginall word vsed by the Apostle hath many significations, it signifieth sometimes to lay vp, something to be vsed in times following, after the manner of Apothecaries, some∣times for a time to suspend, sometimes to abdicate, to re∣nounce, sometimes to put off, as we doe our apparell, and so it is translated, Ephes. 4.22. sometimes to cast away, so rendred, Heb. 12.1. and many other significations there be of this word, but one signification it hath, that doth most fitly agree to this place, and to the purpose of the Apostle, and that is, to put aside, or to put cleane out of sight, as we vse to doe the bodies of dead men, when wee burie them, and put them into their graues, to this the A∣postle doth heere allude, when he saith (put away) conti∣nuing in his similitude begun verse 5. Mortifie your sins, kill them, and then he goes on, and saith, put them aside, cleane out of sight, as dead bodies are when they are bu∣ried, and so his meaning is, deale with your sinnes, as you vse to deale with the dead bodies of men, burie them, put them cleane out of your sight, haue no more to doe with them, then the liuing vse to haue with the dead: (yee also) for so runnes the text in the originall (But now put away, yee also) that is, yee aswell as other true be∣leeuers
(all these things) Some render the words (as in∣deed they may) more generally (all things) howsoeuer they be translated, whether all things, or with limitation, all these things, the meaning is all sinnes, or all these sins heere specified. Thus then wee are to conceiue these words. (But now put away. &c.) as if the Apostle had said. But now being conuerted and truely called, put away cleane out of sight, and deale you with all these sinnes, as other true beleeuers doe, bury them, haue no more to do with them, then the liuing haue with the dead, let them be taken quite out of the way, let not any print, or memory of them remaine amongst you. Now heere, first, we are to marke, that the Apostle vr∣geth his exhortation by the circumstance of time, and of the condition of the Colossians now conuerted, and now truly beleeuing, that whereas before when they were in their naturall condition, they walked in sinne, now being conuerted, and beleeuing in Christ, they ought to mortifie, and to put away the sinnes, wherein before they walked; wee see then, the Apostle makes effectuall cal∣ling, a ground whereon to build his exhortation, hee held the Colossians truelie conuerted, and effectuallie cal∣led, and heereupon hee doth exhort them to put away  sinne.Such as are in their naturall condition hold on a course in sin and can doe nothing else, but such as are taken out of that conditiō can mooue themselues to doe good, & to mortifie, & to put away their own sins Hence we may gather a maine difference between such as are in their natuall condition, and such as are taken out of it, effectually called, and truelie regenerate; the one sort walke on in sinne, and can doe nothing but hold on a continued course in sinne, but the other, they are in a∣bled to stirre, and to moue themselues to do that which is truely good, and to mortifie, and to put away their owne sinnes; howsoeur, indeed, in the first act of conuersion, and regeneration men are meerelie passiue not able to moue, or to doe any thing tending thereunto; yet in the course of holinesse, after true conuersion, they are able to
mooue and doe that which is truely good, and to auoide euill; for true faith wrought in the heart by the spirit of God, doth alter and change the heart, and doth turne a man into a new creature, and conuersation, as the holy Ghost saith, Acts 15.9. Faith purifieth the heart: and the heart once purified, the whole man is altered and changed. And hereby then trie thy selfe, if thou find no alteration in thy selfe,A ground of triall whether we be effectu∣ally called, & haue faith, or no. but after long continuance of the vse of the meanes of thy calling, thou art now the same then was heeretofore, and thou hast not yet any power to mortifie, and to put away thy old sinne, thou maiest speake of faith, calling and conuersion, but indeed thou art but an vnprofitable babler, thou dost but misconster the Scripture, that speaks of faith, and calling, and interpret it after thine owne blind reason, and foolish fancie; if thou be effectually called, and truely regenerate, thou shalt find thine heart cleane changed, and farre otherwise disposed then in former times, thou shalt find that thou hast power to loue that which before thou couldst not but hate, and to delight in that which before thou diddest abhorre, and to hate that which before thou couldst not but loue; yea thou shalt finde thy soule set at libertie, and made able (though not perfectlie, by reason of the reliques of origi∣nall corruption) yet in some measure truelie to follow the will of God, and hereby trie and examine thy selfe. Wee are in the next place to marke, that the Apostle v∣seth this forme of speech (put away) as a further amplifi∣cation of the dutie of mortification, hee thought it not sufficient to say mortifie your sinnes, make them no more able to stirre and mooue then a dead man, but heere hee goes further, and saith, put away your sinnes, burie them, put them cleane out of sight, haue no more to doe with them then the liuing haue with the dead; from this en∣largement wee are plainely taught thus much. That to the mortifying of sinne, wee must adde the bu∣riall
of sinne; or more plainely thus, wee must goe on from one degree of mortification to another, and neuer rest vsing meanes, till our sinnes be truly mortified, and as it were a dead bodie buried, we must neuer rest till wee be sure that our sinne is truely mortified,We must goe from one de∣gree of mor∣tification to another and neuer rest till our sinne bee truly morti∣fied. as wee are sure that a man is truelie dead when he is buried: hence it is, that true beleeuers are said to be baptized, not onely into the death of Christ, but to be buried with him, Rom. 6.3.4. And this Epist. cap. 2.12. the Apostle saith, there was wrought in the Colossians by neemes of their coniunction with Christ, a spirituall death, and also a buriall with him; and this must euery true beleeuer labour to finde in him∣selfe, euen such a true mortification of sinne, as that his sinne, is as it were buried, and put cleane out of his sight, and that he hath no more to doe with it then a liuing bo∣die hath with the dead. And heerein many deceiue themselues,  they thinke themselues mortified and dead to sinne,Many deceiue themselues in thinking they are mortified because they abstaine from sōe sin which formerly they haue vsed. because they ab∣staine from some sinne which they haue heeretofore vsed, yea they thinke they are truely mortified, humbled, and repentant for their sinnes; if (as the Lord complaineth Isai. 58.5:) they afflict their soules for a day, and hang downe their heads as a bull rush, &c. If when they come to the Lords Table, they then put aside their sinnes for a time, though afterward they return to their former vomit, and wallowing in the mire, as the Apostle speakes, 2 Pet. 2 22. Thus doth the Deuill delude many in the world; let vs then know that it is no true repentance, to lay aside our sinne for a time, and afterward to take it vp againe, with as much pleasure as euer wee did: they that so thinke are blinded by the Deuill, and they deceiue their own soules, thou art not to thinke that thou art truely mortified, and dead to sinne, onelie because thou dost abstaine from this, or that sinne which thou hast vsed before, a bare ab∣staining from sinne will not assure thee that thou art true∣lie mortified, therein thou maiest be like one in a swowne,
or in a trance, that seemes to be dead, and yet is a liue, and life comes againe and shewes it selfe. Thou wilt say, but how shall I know, that I abstaining from the sinne which I haue heeretofore vsed, am indeede truly mortified. I answer thee, thou shalt thus know it, remember this as a true note of mortification in abstaining from that sin, if thou (hauing ability, and occasion offered for the pra∣ctise of it) doe notwitstanding abstaine from it, and that with a a detestation of it, euen because it is sinne, and dis∣pleasing to God, I say, if thou abstaine from it with an ab∣horring, and loathing of it, as the Apostle exhorts, Rom. 12 9. where the word vsed signifieth to hate with an extreame hatred, euen as we hate and detest hell; if thy abstaining from that sinne, bee with such detestation of it, then cer∣tainely thou art mortified, yea then thou art come to a no∣table degree of mortification, therein thou art like to God himselfe, who not onely dislikes sinne, but hates and ab∣horres it: Prouerb. 6.16. Yea, it is worthy obseruation, that the Lord hates not onely sinne,Note. but euen the mem∣ber that is made the instrument of sinne, as it followeth, vers. 17.18. (but that by the way) it is an infallible chara∣cter and signe of the true feare of God, if hauing abilitie to practise sinne, thou doe abstaine from the sinne thou hast heeretofore vsed in hatred of it, because it is sinne, and dis∣pleasing to God: Prou. 8.13. The feare of the Lord is to hate euill. Hereby then trie thy selfe in thy abstaining from sinne, thou shalt finde this a certaine rule, it will neuer de∣ceiue thee. Obserue wee further, that the Apostle saith, (put away yee also) that is, euen yee beleeuing Colossians, as well as other beleeuers; the Apostle stirres vp the Colos∣sians, to doe as other true beleeuing Christians did, to mor∣tifie, and to put away sinne, as others did that were trulie called. Hence we are put in minde of this dutie.
That true Christians ought to doe that which belongs  to all of that profession,Euery true beleeuer ought to con∣forme him∣selfe to other true beleeuers in all things pertaining to his holy pro∣fession. it is the part of euery true beleeuer to be conformable to other true beleeuers in all things that pertaine to that holy profession and calling, there be graces common to all Christians, as they are Christians, as know∣ledge, faith, hope, loue, &c. and all these must bee found in euery true beleeuer in some measure, and there be duties common to all Christians, as to deny themselues, to bee dead to sinne, to crucifie the flesh, to shew mutuall loue to their brethren, and euery true beleeuer must be a doer of these in some measure, and it is common to all Christans patiently to beare any affliction laid vpon them, for Christ and for the true profession of his Gospell, and thus the ho∣ly Ghost, vrgeth his exhortation: Hebr. 12.1. hauing ga∣thered a cloud of witnesses, he concludes, wherefore let vs also cast away euery thing that presseth downe, and the sinne that hangeth so fast on. Heereby I might stand to taxe and reproue such as will  needes bee held true Christians,Reproofe of such as will be held true Christians, and yet are nothing like them. and yet are no more like true beleeuers in their liues (then as wee vse to say) an ap∣ple is like to an oyster, they will needes bee like the best in hope, they say they hope to bee saued, as well as the best, and yet they differ not in life and conuersation from the worst, euen from such as shall be damned. But I desire ra∣ther to presse this duty on such, as are indeed true profes∣sors of the Gospell. Let them consider they are not to differ one from ano∣ther,  A true belee∣uer must not suffer any sin to cleaue vnto him, which he sees other true beleeuers haue put away from them. in doing or suffering things common to that holy profession, yea, they are to take heed they suffer not anie sinne to cleaue vnto them, which they see other true belee∣uers haue put away, art thou proud and selfe-conceited, & seest others humble and lowly? art thou couetous, & seest other professors out of loue with the things of this world? art thou cruell towards thy poore brethren, & seest others of tender bowels and full of mercy? oh let it shame thee & be stird vp by the example of others, that profes the gospell with
thy selfe to put away thy sinne, suffer not any sin to cleaue to the, which thou seest, other true beleeuers haue morti∣fied, and put away from them, labour thou to be like them in all holines & godly conuersation, set before thee the ex∣ample of such as are most godlie Paul set his example before Timoth. 2.3.10. and endeauor thou to be like them. One thing yet remaines to bee noted from these words, the Apostle sayth (all sinnes) or (all these things) the poynt is this. Wee must put from vs all sinnes, as Dauid saith, Psalm. 119.101.We must put from vs all sinne. I haue refrained my feet from euery euill way, Herod went to farre as hee did many things Iohn taught him, but still hee would keepe his brothers wife, so many men happily put away couetousnesse, and yet retaine drunkennesse,  some againe put away drunkennesse, and yet vse swearing,Reproofe of such as put a∣way one sin and retaine another. or false dealing, others put away swea∣ring, and yet keepe malice and slandering, euery one al∣most will haue his best pleasing sinne, but we must know, that one knowen sinne is able to defile the whole life, one dead flie marres the boxe of sweet oyntment, Eccles. 10.1. the Diuell will not much trouble vs if he hold vs entangled in any one sinne, that is enough to draw vs downe to hell, as a little leake in a ship not stopped, is enough in time to sinke the ship, and he that makes no conscience of one sin, is guilty of breaking the whole law, Iam. 2.10. therefore learne thou to make conscience of euery sinne whatsoeuer dispence not with any one, but bee thou carefull to morti∣fie, and put away euery sinne. Come we now to the Apostles particular enumeration, his reckoning vp of the sinnes, that are to be put away, ten∣ding to the hurt of others, in the words following.
Wrath. Anger. Maliciousnesse. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying. In this catalogue the Apostle reckons not vppe all that might haue beene remembred, but only some more com∣mon sins, and such as are most of all crosse and contrary to brotherly loue, the sinnes heere reckoned vp, are either Inward Or Outward Inward, are the three first: Wrath. Anger. Maliciousnesse. And the other three are outward. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying. And againe, the three first are sinnes against the sixth commandement. And the three other, are partly against the sixth, and partly against the ninth commandements: of these sinnes as they lie in order, the three first, Wrath, Anger, Maliciousnesse, are all sins vnder one head, they are inward breaches of the sixth commandement, and touching these sinnes. I will First shew what they are, with the greatnesse of them. Secondly, the means that are to be vsed for the putting of them away with some application. And then in the third place, come to some generall do∣ctrine, offered from this verse.
Wrath) by wrath in this place, we are to vnderstand the first sinnefull motion of the heart,Interpreta∣tion. against another person desiring reuenge or punishment stirred vp by some of∣fence committed. When a mans heart is stirred vp against another, through iniury or wrong done, or supposed to be done, to desire reuenge or punishment, then is there an∣ger or wrath in his heart,What wrath is. and this (anger) or (wrath) may be thus described, it is a corrupt and sinfull desire of re∣uenge, or punishment in respect of some offence, and that we misconceiue it not,Difference of anger and wrath two∣fold. I will stand a while to make it more plaine, by shewing a difference of anger and wrath. First we must know that (Anger) is a naturall affecti∣on, it was planted in our first Parents, in the first creation, yea, it was found in Christ himselfe who was without sinne, Mark. 3.5. hee looked round about on them ungodly, and therefore anger is not in it selfe a sinne, and alwayes sinnefull. Againe, we must know that anger is sometimes lawfull and good, yea sometimes not onely allowed, but required as Eue should haue beene angry with the serpent, and A∣dam with her, for tempting to sinne, and anger is then law∣full and good,Note when it is rightly conceiued, and directed to a right obiect (namely) against sinne (for as one sayth well) he that is not angry for sinne,When anger is good, and when it is not good. either knowes not sin (or hates it not as hee ought) anger therefore is lawfull, and good when it is rightly conceiued, and directed to a right obiect, and that with due measure; according to the nature of the obiect, and this I might shew by many exam∣ples in Scripture, as of Moses, of Phineas, of Elias, Dauid, Nehemiah, &c. yea, thus our Sauiour shewed himselfe an∣gry with Peter,Mat. 16.23. when he called him Diuell, and said to him, get thee behind me Satan, & by this we may easily conceiue on the contrary, what anger is corrupt and sinfull, namely, such as is rash and hastily conceiued without iust cause, or on euery trifling occasion,Mat. 5.22. whereof our Sauiour speakes,
whosoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, or the cause being iust, and weightie, such anger as is directed amisse, as either against the person, or against the offence onely, as it is an offence to man, as an iniurie, and wrong bringing hurt and dammage to men, and not as an offence to God, Daniel 3.19. And lastly, such anger as doth exceed mea∣sure, and is not according to the nature of the obiect, but is as great for a small offence as for a greater, and is an excessiue desire of reuenge, troubling the mind, & making it forget dutie to God, and men; for holy, and good anger doth euer quicken, & stir vp men to praier, and other good duties. Moses was very angry, Ex. 32.19. yet he praied ver. 31.32. and good anger is euer ioined with compassion o∣uer them that haue offended, & sorrow for their sin: so we read that Christ was angry & sorie Mar. 3.5. and then doth anger exceed measure when it so troubles the mind as men are put by these duties both to God, and to their brethren, we see then what corrupt and sinfull anger is. Now the greatnesse of this sinne may easily appeare,The greatnes of this sinne. it is reekoned vp among the works of the flesh, Gal. 5.20. it is euil in it selfe, and stird vp by the deuil, it is the murder of the heart, such murder as the heart is able to commit; yea it is the note, and fountaine of the murder of the tongue, and hand, for it not onely admitteth, and receiueth con∣tention, and strife, as a match receiueth fire, but it stirres it vp, and is as the bellows blowing the coales of contention Prou. 15.18. An angrie man stirreth vp strife, and of strife & contention comes murder, both of the tong & hand, yea all manner of euill works, Iam. 3.16. Therefore, doubt∣lesse, corrupt wrath and anger is a great sinne. The second sin here named is as the word is translated (anger) but indeed this word doth not expresse the force of the original, the originall word  signifieth,Interpre∣tation. a firie anger and it differs from the former only in degree; for this hot and firie anger,What firie an∣ger is. is onely a further degree of corrupt an∣ger, and it is an inflammation of the heart, and the
whole man, as when through anger the heart is heated, the bloud enflamed, and the whole man as it were set on fire, shewing it selfe in countenance, as it were by sparks of fire, slashing out of the eyes and nostrils, this also is a great sin,The greatnes of this sinne. and it must needs be so, in that it is a further degree of corrupt anger, but consider it in the effects, and wee shall finde it most odious, it is hurtfull euen to a mans owne bo∣dy many times, so enflaming the bloud that it brings a fe∣uer, yea some say, it being often and vsuall, it drieth vp & consumeth the radicall moisture, and causeth a consump∣tion, but much more odious is it in the fearefull effects of it towards others it makes a man dare to speake or doe he cares not what,Note euen to breake out into cursing, swearing, rayling, reuiling, &c. it is (as one sayth) the drunkennesse of the minde, a man in time of such inflamation, hath no regard to himselfe or others, no not to those whom hee ought to respect, we may see it in Iacobs sons, Simeon & Le∣ui, Gen. 34.30. in their heat they slew the Shechemites with∣out regard of any thing, they regarded not their fathers state in the land, and their owne in that country, that they were but strangers, and few in number, and that extreame danger might follow, both to their father, & to themselues fiery anger had so darkned their minds, that reason could haue no rule in them, for indeed, as one saith well, reason to a mind incensed with anger, is like a key to a lock that is nimbled, it can doe no good, yea, this fiery anger makes a man haste to dishonor God, & to wound, & kill both him∣selfe & others, therfore without question this is a great sin What malici∣ousnesse is.The 3. sin here set down, is (Maliciousnes) and this also is a sinne of the same kinde with the former, it is an inward breach of the sixth commandement, & it is yet a further de¦gree of corrupt anger, it is old and inueterate anger, or con∣tinuing wrath, it is anger or wrath, kept close in the heart, cloaked and couered for a time, with purpose to do hurt, and waiting for opportunity to do mischiefe, this was Cains anger against his brother Abel, Gen. 4. he lapped vp closely
in his bosom, a conceiued wrath and displeasure against his brother, & he couered it, & spake faire, to him ver. 8. come let vs go into the field, and when he had him there he slew him, and this also is a most odious and detestable sin,The greatnes of this sinne. not only because it is the daughter of such mothers, as wrath & anger but because it is a going on in sinne, and a sinne co∣loured ouer for a time, anger that cannot speake, is most wicked, but anger that can speake, and speake faire,Note. and meane ill, that is wickednesse it selfe, and so wee see what those sinnes are, and the greatnesse of them. Now consider we the speciall meanes, that are to be vsed for the mortifying and putting away of these sinnes,Meanes ser∣uing for the mortifying of these sinnes are foure. the speciall meanes are these. First, a serious and due consideration of our owne vile∣nes and sin, for many striue against anger and wrath, & the  more they striue, the more they fret, because they look not into their own harts and liues, and they consider not their own sins, & none are more violent, passionate and fiery a∣gainst others that offend them, then such as are most care∣les in the consideration of their owne sins and offences a∣gainst God, for the due consideration of our owne vilenes and sins, would coole our heat, & bee a notable meanes to turne the course of our anger against our selues for our sins & to work in vs that indignation the Apostle commends.1. Cor. 7.11. The second means is a due consideration of Gods pro∣uidence,  that nothing befals vs but by the prouidence of God, and wee being his children nothing but that which shal turne to our good, and such as wrong vs, are the instru∣ments of his good prouidence, for the exercise and triall of our patience, and if we be angry with them, surely, our an∣ger goes higher, and reacheth vp to God himselfe, this was Dauids consideration, 2. Sam. 16.10.11. Shemei curseth be∣cause the Lord hath bidden him to curse, and this is a notable meanes for the mortifying of the foolish passion of anger. The third means is, auoydance of alloccasions of vn∣lawfull  anger, as contentions, and as much as we can kee∣ping
keeping our selues from the company of contentious per∣sons, Pro. 22.24. make no frindship with an angry man, neither goe with the furious man, mistaking and misconstruing the words & actions of others, gaming, drunkennes, to whom is strife and quarrelling &c.Proo. 23.29. vers. 30. euen to them that tarry long at the wine, to them that goe to seeke mixt wine. The fourth meanes, and that most effectuall, is daily in∣uocation of Gods name, frequent and earnest prayer to the Lord, that hee of his mercy would vouchsafe, by his spirit to mortifie that corrupt & violent affection of vniust anger, for it is only the spirit of God that must order and gouern our harts, & keep vs from rash and vniust anger, & so we see the chiefe means that are to be vsed for the morti∣fying of these sins.Most men & women are vnmortified in respect of the forena∣med sinnes. Now if due triall and examination be made of men & women touching these sins, it is to be fea∣red that the most will be found such as are not mortified in respect of them, are there not many persons that are easily prouoked to anger at euery trifling occasion for the mo∣uing of a straw in comparison? doe not many direct their anger against the person, & not against the sin, & if they be angry for the offence, is it not only as its an offence to thē∣selus, not as an offence to God? let a seruant neglect his du¦ty, or do a thing crosse & vntowardly wherby he brings da∣mage to his master & presently his master or mistris are an∣gry with him, & mightily inrag'd, & they say they are angry for the fault of their seruant, but let the same seruant curse or swear break the sabboth, & then they are either nothing at all, or very little moued, & that is a plaine euidence they are angry for the offence, as it is an offence to themselues, & not as it is a sin against God, and is the number small of such as are incensed with anger, breaking out into cursing, swearing, raging, & most furious behauior, & are there not many that suffer anger to lodge in their harts, yea, do they not couer it for a time, and when opportunity serues, shew it forth? yea, some there be, that nothing will moue to put away their conceiued displeasure, no words, no deeds, no
good spoken, or done to them, can stir them one iot, they will not suffer their malice to be ouercome; such persons they are worse then prophane Esau,Gen. 33. wee read that he was ouercome by Iacobs kindenesse, and mooued to lay aside his malice, and wilt thou be worse then prophane Esau, a man noted for prophanenesse, and standing for a perpe∣tuall record, Heb. 12.16. for a prophane person? Then the conclusion will fall heauy on thee; prophane Esau shall rise vp one day in iudgement against thee, and condemne thee: thinke on it thou that art growne olde in thy malice, and wilt not be appeased; and let all those that find themselues guilty of these sins, (Wrath, anger,Eccles. 7.11. Two motiues to stirre vs vp to vse the meanes in mortifying the forenamed sinnes. ma∣liciousnes) be stird vp to a careful vse of the means that serue for the mortifying of them. It is said, That rash anger re∣steth in the bosome of fooles. It is an open proclamation of folly; such as are rashlie angrie, are fooles in print, and that in Gods booke: and consider we further these two things. First, wrathfull anger, and malice, lying in the heart, no good dutie can be done to God, or men. Iam. 1.19.  Be slow to wrath, saith the Apostle, and marke his reason, verse 20. The wrath of man doth not accomplishe the righteous∣nesse of God, as if he had said, in time of wrathful anger thou canst doe nothing that is good, and pleasing to God. 1. Tim. 2.8. I will that men pray euery where lifting vppe pure hands without wrath or doubting. The Apostle there giues vs to vnderstand, that if wrath be harboured in the heart the hands lift vppe in praier are not pure, they are defiled with bloud, as it is, Isai. 1.15. and our praier is abomina∣ble to the Lord: and thus it is in all other parts of Gods worship, in our hearing of the Word, in receiuing the Sa∣craments, &c. We can doe nothing pleasing to God, and with comfort to our selues. Secondly, consider that wrathfull anger, and malice,  makes a man a vassaile of Satan; yea, the Deuill chaseth an heart troubled with wrath to worke many mischiefes in. We read that Saul was a raging man, and the Lord
sent an euill spirit vpon him. And the Apostle to his ex∣hortation, Ephes. 4.16. Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath, subioines, Neither giue place to the Deuill. As if he had said, giue place to vniust anger, suffer it to lodge with thee, and then thou giuest place to the diuell, he be∣comes thy bedfellow, and thou art his slaue; if then wee would not make our selues vnfit to doe any good dutie, and vtterlie vnmeet to serue God in any acceptable sort, and if we would bee loath to bring our selues in bondage to Satan, let vs be stirred vp to vse all good meanes, ser∣uing to mortifie rash, vniust, anger, firie heat, and malice; Let vs often meditate on our owne vilenesse, and sinnes, and duelie consider Gods prouidence, that nothing comes vnto vs, but by the good prouidence of God, and let vs auoid all occasions of vniust anger, and pray vnto God that he would vouchsafe by his good spirit to order, and gouerne our hearts, and to keepe them from vniust anger, and then, no doubt, in time by Gods blessing on those meanes vsed, we shall be enabled to mortifie, and to put away from vs, wrath, anger, and malitiousnesse. Come wee now to speake of some generall doctrine offered vnto vs from these words. And first, in that the first motion of the heart desiring  reuenge, euen rash anger is to be mortified, and put away from vs, we may conclude. That rash anger is not (as the Papists terme it) a ve∣niall sinne (that is) a sinne (as some of their owne Writers describe veniall) not deseruing Hell,Rash anger is not a veniall sinne, that is veniall in the Popish sense. nor binding men to be so sorrie for it, but that it may be forgiuen by knocking the breast, going into a Church, sprinkling of holy water &c. But rash anger is a sinne in it selfe, and in it owne na∣ture deseruing eternall death, it is ranged by Christ him∣selfe, the best interpreter of the Lawe, vnder the sixth Commandement, as a breach of it. Matth. 5.21. Yee haue heard that it was said to them of old, thou shalt not kill, for who∣souer killeth, shall bee culpable of iudgement: verse 22. But
I say vnto you, whosoeuer is angrie with his brother vnaduised∣ly shall be culpable of iudgement: therefore it makes subiect to the curse of God, and eternall death, according to that of the Apostle, Galat. 3.10. Cursed is euery man that con∣tinueth not in al things that are written in the Booke of the Law to doe them. But the Papists thinke they haue sufficient ground for their conceit from that text Mat. 5.22.  because our Sauior saith onely in the last place, Whosoeuer shall say foole, shall be worthy to hee punished with hell fire. See, say the Papists, hee saith not, he that is angry with his brother vnaduisedly, is worthy to be punished with Hell fire, but in the last place, whosoeuer shall call his brother foole, therefore Hell fire is onely due to him that calles his brother foole, and so rash anger deserues not euerlasting damnation. I answere them,  the purpose of Christ in that place was not to shew that onely the last sinne there mentioned, deserues eternall damnation, but that euery one of these sinnes deserues it, beeing a transgression of the Law of God, yet in a different degree, that is the purpose of Christ in that place, to shew the different degree of eternall pu∣nishment due to euery one of those sinnes, according to the different degrees of the sinnes, and to this purpose he alludes to the formes of iudgement amongst men, and e∣specially among the Iewes. The naming then of Hell fire, onely in the last place, shewes not a diuers kinde of pu∣nishment from the rest, but a diuers degree, that a greater degree of punishment belongs to the last sinne, then to the two former, and so that text makes nothing for vpholding the opinion of the Papists. Obserue we further, that our apostle speaking of these inward sinnes, Wrath, Anger, Maliciousnesse, hee puts them downe in order, as they goe one beyond another in degree, as First, rash anger. Secondlie, hot and firie anger.
Thirdly, maliciousnesse, inueterate anger, or continu∣ing anger. Hence onely note we thus much. That sinne creepeth into the heart by steps, and by degrees,Sinne cree∣peth into the heart by steps and by de∣grees. it is the subtiltie of Satan to conuey sinne into the heart by little, and little, he makes not men malicious at the first, but by his secret vnmarked creeping into their hearts, he conueies into them, happily at the first, onely a conceit against such a person, and a misliking of him, that misliking hauing once entred, then hee hath gotten hold, and then he makes them displeased, and rashly an∣grie almost with euery thing, said, or done, by the party misliked; yea shortly after to be incensed with anger, and euen mad against the same partie, and in the ende, they meditating, and musing on a conceiued wrong done, or supposed to be done, hee makes them purpose to doe a mischiefe, yea to take delight in so purposing, and to thinke it good for them so to doe; no doubt, malicious persons may easilie obserue that their malice hath beene begotten, brought foorth, and growne to strength, by these steps. It is therefore the dutie of euery one of vs to checke the course of Satan at the first,Our dutie is to checke the course of Sa∣tan at the first. not to bee of an hastie spirit to be angry, not to suffer our selues suddenly, and on euery occasion to be stird vp to anger, lest the Deuill get within vs, and presse vs on to a further degree. It will be said, anger is a violent affection, and comes on a sudden, so that a man (especially, beeing prouoked by the wrath of others) cannot choose, but sometimes bee moued to wrath againe. To this I answer: we are therefore when we are quiet, and out of our angrie moode, often to cal to minde, and to thinke of the meanes that serue for the mortifying of that hastie passion, and to adde to them other holy meditati∣ons, and if at any time thou be ouercome of anger, yet re∣member the counsell of the Apostle, Ephes. 4.26. Let not
the Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath. Let it not lodge with thee, deale in this case as a man that hath drunke poyson, that as hee will vse meanes presently to cast it out, lest it spread into his bowels, and infect all the partes of his bodie: so doe not thou suffer rashe anger to rest in thy bo∣some, but vse all good meanes with speede to bee ridde of it; and in this case doe as Ionathan did, 1. Sam. 20.24. de∣part from him, or them, with whom thou art angrie, em∣ploy thy selfe some other way, about some thing thou canst bee most earnest, and thou shalt soone cease to bee angrie. Now follow the outward sinnes heere reckoned vp. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking, and Lying. And of these in order, as they are laid downe by the Apostle, the first is Cursed speaking. 1 I will first shewe, what is meant heere by Cursed speaking, and the greatnesse of that sinne, with some application. 2 Secondly, the meanes that are to bee vsed for the mortifying of it. 3 And then, come to some generall Do∣ctrine. First therfore, know that the word here translated (Cur∣sed speaking) signifieth blasphemy, or euil speaking,4 Interpreta∣tion. which though it be commonly vnderstood of speaking euill a∣gainst God; yet it signifieth aswell euill speaking against men, we finde the word so vsed, 1. Cor. 4.13. We are euill spoken off. And so is it to be taken in this place as may ap∣peare by the sinnes ioined with it, both going beefore and following after, beeing all of them against men. Now this euill speaking against men,What euill speaking is. may thus bee de∣scribed, it is a word, or speech, whereby the name or esti∣mation of another is hurt, blemished, or obscured, or at
least a word or speech, tending to the hurt and blemish of another. Two sorts of it.And of this euill speaking, there be 2. sorts. The first, is in the parties absence, and that is (backbiting)  which is a speaking ill of another in his absence, who is free from that ill, or speaking that ill, a man knowes by another, being absent, with hatred, and with purpose to hurt him (as Doeg did of Dauid) hee told Saul no more then the truth, but it was with a purpose to hurt him, 1. Sam. 22.9.10. and therein was Doeg a backbiter, and this backbiting is a sinne against the ninth Commande∣ment. The other sort of euill speaking, is in the parties pre∣sence, which is, reuiling, railing, and giuing vile termes to the parties face, though this sometimes is in the parties absence, and this is a breach of the sixth commandement. It is therefore, cursed, or euill speaking against men, when men speake any thing that doth hurt, and blemish, or tend to the hurt, or blemish of the good name of o∣thers, one, or more, either secretly in the parties ab∣sence, or openly in his presence to his face, by open railing, reuiling, and hard termes, yet we must know that hard termes, may sometimes bee vsed, and not bee cursed or euill speaking,Note. as when publike persons, or gouernours vse them, not in way of defamation, but in way of iust re¦proofe: so the Apostle cald the Galathians foolish, Gal. 3.1. our Sauiour the two disciples (foolish) Luk. 24.25. and Herod, Foxe, Luke 13.32. But hard termes vsed by priuate persons, such as haue no calling to passe their iudgement, and censure on others for knowne euill, come within com∣passe of cursed and euill speaking. The greatnes of this sinne.Now this sinne of cursed speaking, whether it be in se∣cret backbiting, or in open reuiling, or railing, is without question, a very great and greeuous sinne; for why? it e∣uer issueth out of a corrupt heart, it comes out from an heart that is full of gall, and bitternesse, euen inueterate
anger, malice, or enuy, that is the root and mother of it, it makes worthy to be punished with hell fire, as our Sa∣uiour hath taught most plainely, Math. 5.22. and if wee looke vpon it in the effects of it towards others, wee shall finde it most hatefull: for hence it is that this sinne of cur∣sed speaking is compared to a rasor that cuts most sharply, Psalm. 52.2. to the thrusting thorow of a sword, Pro. 12.18 to sharpe arrowes shot by a mighty arme, to Iuniper coales which burne most extreamely, and keepe fire very long: Psalm. 120.4. And indeed, neither rasor, nor sword, nor arrow, nor fire, piearceth so deepe, or wounds so incurable, as doth bitter and cursed speaking; for be∣sides the hurt it doth to a mans good name (whereby sometimes all his endeauours in his place and calling, are made frustrate, or of small effect, it many times so pro∣uoketh as no small mischiefe comes of it, many men be∣ing better able to endure any wrong done against their person, or goods, then against their name; yea, the chil∣dren of God can worst of all beare reproachfull words, whereby wicked men seeke to disgrace them,Note. and bring contempt on them, because their good name is euer ioy∣ned with Gods glorie, and if their good name bee im∣peached, they know so much is derogated from his glory, and therefore it must needs be confessed, that cursed spea∣king (bringing forth such foule, and fearefull effects) is a great and greeuous sinne. Now I desire that this great and foule sinne may bee thought on,This foule sin of cursed spea∣king is too common a∣mongst men. & that euery one of vs would learne to auoid it, and put it from vs; for it is two manifest, that euen this sinne also of cursed speaking is amongst vs; what more common then tale-bearing, whispering, and backbiting? Are there not many whose mouthes are full of bitter and venomous speeches? if they be but a little crossed, their mouthes runne ouer with all manner of railing, and cur∣sed speaking, vttering such termes as are not meete to bee named: surely such persons feare not the sentence of our
Sauiour, Matth. 5.22. He that cals his brother foole shall bee in danger of hell fire. They many times giue crosse termes (as damned rogue, dogges face, and the like,) it seemes Hell fire is not hotte enough for such persons, it must bee made hotter: and certainely without Gods great mercy, his curse shall bee doubled on such; yea, and are there not some who goe yet further, they breath out cursed speeches against others, and load them with vile termes, onely because they feare God, and make conscience of their waies, euen because they heare the word and reade the Scripture; and doe not many beltch out most spitefull speeches against them, and say, a yongue Saint, an old Deuill, you will to heauen quicke, you are full of the spirit, the Deuill is within you, with a number of like deuillish speaches, fetcht from the bottomles pit of Hell. I take no pleasure in remembring these things, I wish they that vse them tooke as little, and I wish also that sinne of cursed speaking, and in that height of it I Iaue spoken, were not amongst men, but it is too euident, it is, a man cannot passe the streets, but hee shall heare such cursed speeches. Meanes that serue for the putting away of this sinne are three.And therefore, now let vs consider some meanes that serue for the putting away of this sin; the speciall meanes seruing to that purpose are these. First we must labour for honest, and good hearts, for of  the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, and (as we haue heard) cursed speaking comes from a corrupt heart; wee must therefore labour to purge our hearts of malice and enuie, and to that end, thinke on the meanes before specified. Secondly, we are to set a watch before our mouthes, and to cast as it were, a bit or bridle vpon them, and as Iob saith (recounting his vprightnesse) Iob 31.30. Suffer not our mouthes to sin by wishing a curse vnto his soule, and as Dauid resolued with himselfe, Psalm. 39.1. I thought I will take heede to my waies that I sinne not with my tongue.
And the third meanes (which is that wherby these two  become effectuall) is earnest and hearty praier to God, for he alone it is, that must take away euill out of our hearts, and tame the tongue, which as Iames saith, 3.8. no man can tame, it is not in the power of man to tame it, we therefore must haue recourse to the Lord, and entreat him that hee would purge our hearts, and set a watch ouer our mouthes, that wee may, speake to his glory, and the good of men.Two motiues stirring vs vp to a carefull vse of these meanes. And so we see the speciall meanes that serue for the morti∣fying of this sinne also. Let vs be stirred vp to a carefulll vse of them, and to that purpose consider we these 2. things. First, all manner of vngodly and cursed speaking, is the  Diuels language, the tongue that so speakes, is set on fire of hell, Iam. 3.6. and it is an euidence, that the Diuell bears sway within, and sets the tongue a worke. Secondlie, consider that if thou reuile the children of  God, thou reuilest the spirit of God, 1. Peter 4.14. and will the Lord suffer himselfe to bee reuiled in his children? no, no, assure thy selfe such impietie cannot escape his pu∣nishing hand. But say some,  surely such as wrong vs are not the chil∣dren of God, they are such vile persons, as if we should rake hell, we could not find the like. I would bee answered of thee,  that thus pleadest for thy selfe to this question, are they worse then the Diuell him∣selfe, happily thou wilt say they are as bad, why yet heare what Iude hath taught thee by the example of Michael: ver. 9. Michael the Archangell, when he stroue against the Diuell, and disputed about the bodie of Moses, durst not blame him with cursed speaking, but sayd, the Lord rebuke thee, durst not Mi∣chael reuile the diuell, & wilt thou reuile thy brother? think vpon it, & take heed what thou doest, & for conclusion of this, if we would not make it cleere, both to our selues and others, that wee are far from being guided by the spirit of Christ, and that our hearts are possessed of the Diuell, and our tongues his instruments, if wee would not (happily)
reuile the spirit of God, and shoot out our arrowes of bitter words against heauen, which must needs fall on our selues and bring downe the vengeance of God vpon vs, let vs in the feare of God, be admonished to auoyd cursed speaking let vs be stirred vp to bee earnest with the Lord, entreating him to purge our hearts and to tame our tongues, and to bring them into order, that they may speake to his glory, and the good of our brethren, and though wee bee smitten with the tongue of others, and reuiled, yet that wee may not returne rebuke for rebuke, but contrariwise, blesse, knowing that we are thereunto called, that we should bee heires of blessing, as the Apostle saith, 1. Pet. 3.9. that so we may haue testimony and assurance to our owne soules, that we are heires of heauen, and are within compasse of Gods blessing, and shall be blessed of him in this life, and with euerlasting blessing at his right hand in heauen. Bitternesse in writing can∣not be iustifi∣ed though it be in defence of Gods cause.Now in that this sinne of cursed speaking is to be mor∣tified, and put away from vs, beeing a great and greeuous sinne, it followes by proportion, that cursed writing can∣not be iustified and defended, and that cannot but bee a great sinne, if anie man dip his pen in wormewood, and suffer it to drop downe gall and bitternesse in his writing, yea, though a man write in defence of Gods cause, and truth of religion against notorious heretickes, though they reuile him by their pens, yet he is to commit the iniu∣rie to God, and not to reuile them again, much lesse ought anie man to doe it, in defending his owne priuate cause by writing. We may hence further collect and gather, that if cursed speaking either in secret,Cursing and banning of o∣thers is a foule and fearefull sin and ought to be far from all that pro∣fesse Christ. or openly be a great sinne, and to be put away, then without question, much more is cursing, banning, and imprecation vsed against others, a great and greeuous sinne, if to reuile another, and to giue hard re∣proachfull termes bee a great sinne, then much greater sinne is it to vtter ill, wishing against him, as many gracelesse persons doe, as that a vengeance, or mis∣chiefe
may light vpon him, that must needes bee a most greeuous and fearefull sinne, and ought to bee farre from all that professe Christ, and that wee may see the ouglines of this sinne, know that cursing of others is an abuse, and profanation of an holy ordinance of God? for to curse is to pray against, and prayer ought not to bee vsed ey∣ther to fulfill our lust on such as offend vs, or for the hurt of any. Againe, by cursing men they take on them the office of God, they step vp into Gods chayre of iudgement. 1 For first they iudge the party, when they curse worthy punishment. 2 And they determine the punishment that shal befal him, & wish it may light vpon him 3 And further hee that curseth another, goes about as much as lies in him to make the Lord partaker with him in his sinne, for he being offended with the party, in a rage and violent passion desires the Lord to power some iudgement vpon him, and would haue the Lord bend down to satisfie his reuenge∣full desire, which is a fearefull height of im∣piety. Desire of reuenge is wicked, but to vse God in it, and as much as in thee is, to make him a party, or an executioner of thy rage, seeking and wishing that hee may curse and plague where thou wilt, he being all iustice, all mercy, and all goodnes it selfe. O what an encrease,  and what a mea∣sure of sinne is that, thinke on it whosoeuer thou art, that eyther through weakenesse yeelding to the rage of thy vn∣bridled affections, or through deepe and dead security hast thy mouth opened to curse and ban,Wee are to consider how fearefull a sin cursing is and learne to a∣uoid it. (which is a thing too common in the world) yea thinke on it seriously, that the cursing of others is a taking of Gods name in vaine, and then remember what is the state of such as take Gods name in vaine, euen fearefull and damnable, they stand guilty
before the iudgement seat of God, and the Lord who on∣lie doth iustifie and acquite his children, hath sayd, he will not hold and account them guiltlesse, and if the Lord will not acquite and discharge thee from thy sinne, who then shall be able to acquite and free thee from the damnation of hell, let it therefore settle and sinke into thy heart, what a fearefull and horrible sinne it is to curse and banne, and learne to auoyd it. Come wee to the next outwarde sinne heere named, namely, (filthy speaking) and in handling of this: I will 1 First, shew the sinne it selfe, and the greatnes of it, with examination touching the same. 2 Secondly, the meanes that serue for the mortify∣ing of it. 3 And then deduce some further doctrine that will follow vpon it, that this sinne is to be put away. For the first of these, know wee that this sinne of filthie speaking may thus be generally conceiued, it is a word or speech vttered that beseemes not Christian honesty, when men speake of things that may mooue blushing, in grosse and vnseemely termes, that in generall is filthy speaking. What filthy speaking is.But more especially, filthie speaking heere intended and meant, is any obscene, immodest, or vnchaste worde, or speech, the Apostle here meaneth, such vncleane & beastly words, as are wont to proceed out of the mouthes of vn∣cleane persons, and this the Apostle cals corrupt or rotten speech, Eph. 4.29. and Eph. 5.4. he reckons vp obscenity or filthinesse, among things not to be named, and this is a sinne against the seuenth commandement, and the great∣nesse of it may easily appear to vs, thus it is a breach of that commandement, not onely as a fruit of vncleannesse in such as vse it, but also is an entisement, and a prouocation to stirre vp others to vncleannesse:The greatnes of this sinne. and hence it is, that the Apostle in the place before cited, calles filthie speech, corrupt or rotten speech, comparing it to a corrupt, or rotten flesh, that not onely stinketh, and hath
happilie wormes engendered in it selfe, but is poisonfull and hurtfull to all that come neere it, and hence it is like∣wise, that the mouth (as in regard of all euill speech ge∣nerallie) so of this especiallie is compared to a peruerted mouth, Pro. 4.24. hauing as it were the vpper lip standing where the nether lip should stand, and contrariwise; yea, hence it is, that the mouth or throat is compared to an o∣pen sepulcher, Rom. 3.13. to an open graue, breathing & steeming vp most loathsom & filthie smels, and certainlie the greatnesse of this sinne is notablie expressed, in that it is called corrupt speech, for that shewes it is extreamly wic∣ked, and sinfull, the holy Ghost commonlie vseth that manner of speaking, to set out the exceeding greatnesse & foulnes of sin, as when men before the flood were extream¦lie wicked, and their liues stained with most foule sinnes, then the holie Ghost, Gen. 6.12. saith, all flesh had corrupt his way vpon the earth, and thus the Lord speakes of his peo∣ple: Zephaniah 3.7. that they corrupted all, &c. signifying that all were exceedingly wicked, therfore filthie speaking being rotten and corrupt speech, we may conclude that it is most wicked & abhominable, & this we are to consider, & think on, it is the fashion of the world to make small ac∣count of this sin, yea,Reproofe of such as are guilty of this sinne. wicked persons oftentimes boast of it, and make it the matter of their sport and merriment, and too many there be, that are delighted in ribald and filthie speaking, yea, they make it their repast and recreation, to vtter wanton speeches, to tell filthy tales, and to sing songs and sonnets, and ballads of loue, and lightnesse, and most abhominable filthinesse; yea, I may say to manie in this respect, as Christ said to the Pharises, in another case, Mat. 12.27. euen your children shall heerein bee witnesses against you, may not a man often heare it out of the mouthes of children, euen filthie speeches vttered by the mouthes of children? and that is a plaine euidence, that their Parents, and others with whom they liue cannot wash their hands, and cleere themselues of this sinne, since then the hearts
of many will tell them they are guilty of this sinne, let vs thinke on it, and consider the greatnesse of it, and if wee desire to bee freed from it, consider wee the meanes that serue to that purpose,Meanes ser∣uing for the mortification of this sinne are three. the speciall meanes tending to the mortifying of this sinne, are in effect the same with those, that serue for the mortifying of cursed speaking, as, First, we are to labour for chaste hearts, that our hearts  may be chaste, and purged of all filthy and vncleane lusts, if the heart be vncleane the tongue will be filthie, as a stin∣king breath argues rotten lungs and filthie inwards,Note. so fil∣thie rotten speech discouers a corrupt, and rotten heart, it is but a vaine speech of some, who say, though my speech be filthie, yet my heart is cleane, we must therefore labour by an holy feare of God, by sound and true delight in his word, and by other good meanes ro purge the heart of fil∣thie lusts. The second meanes is, to set a watch before our mouths Iob was neuer adulterer, yet made hee couenant with his eies, because he being cleane in heart, would giue no occa∣sion outwardly, so must we in respect of this sinne. The third meanes is also praier to God, that he would by his spirit purge our harts, and so order and gouerne our mouthes, that they may neuer be soiled with the dregs of filthie speaking. Motiues to stir vs vp to a carefull vse of these meanes.Now to stirre vs vp to a carefull vse of these meanes, be∣sides the greatnesse of this sinne (which no doubt is of waight to as many as feare God, to make conscience of so great a sinne) consider we what our Sauiour saith, Matth. 12.36. that of euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue account, at the day of iudgement, (that is) of euerie such word as brings no profit to men, nor honour to God, though it doe not directlie dishonour God, or hurt men, and if of euerie such word men must be accomptable at the day of iudgement, then certainelie much more for filthie wordes, if the trisler, and vaine babler, one that pow∣ers out words that bring no profit to himselfe, nor others,
shall not be able to stand before the iudge of all the world at the daie of iudgement, where shall the filthie speaker, whose words haue offended God, and as a pestilent breath haue brought much infection, and hurt to men, bee able to appeare: yea, I may safely speake, to thee that art a filthie speaker, and doest delight in filthie speaking, in the words of Christ himselfe, Matth. 23.33. how wilt thou escape the damnation of hell, surelie, without Gods vnspea∣kable mercie thou shalt not escape it, therefore thinke on thy sinne, and make no tush at it, but now while thou hast time be humbled for that which is past, and be stirred vp in the feare of God, to vse all good meanes that heereafter thou mayest be enabled through Gods blessing, vpon the meanes to put away from thee all immodest, rotten, and filthie speaking. Now in that this sinne of filthie speaking, or the speak∣ing  of filthinesse is a great sin,The acting of filthinesse as stage-players doe, is a most fearefull sinne. we may hence gather with∣out question, the acting of filthinesse is much more a sin, if to speake filthily bee a great sinne, then doubtlesse, farre greater sinne is it to acte filthinesse, to represent and set it out, not onelie by speech, but by gesture, and by conuey∣ances and deuices, as stage-plaies doe, for what are stage-plaies, but representations of the vices, and filthie sinnes of men in the world by speech and gesture?  and therefore much are they to bee condemned,Reproofe of them who make their children stage-players. who make or tend to make their children stage-plaiers, yea know it, that to make thy childe a stage-plaier, is to dedicate him to the Diuell, and to make him his instrument, and touching this, I will say no more then an ancient Diuine saith, plaiers behaui∣our polluteth all things, and of plaies he saith, they are the feasts of Satan, and the inuentions of the Diuell. Come wee to the last wordes of this verse, (out of your mouths) thogh these words may be referred both to cursed speaking, and to filthie speaking, yet (as I take it) they haue speciall relation to the latter of these, and therefore we find them added by the Apostle, Ephes. 4.29. Let no corrupt
communication proceed out of your mouth, the point hence of∣fered is this. That if filthinesse be conceiued in the heart, yet wee are not to suffer it to breake out of our mouthes,Though the heart con∣ceiue filthines yet the mouth must not vtter it. we are indeed as much as is possible to keepe our hearts free from all vn∣cleane conceits, but if they bee cast in by Satan, or arise from our owne corruption, wee are not to vtter them with our mouthes in the hearing of others. The reason is plaine, it is a further degree of sinne, to thinke ill is a sinne,  but to vtter that conceiued ill, is a fur∣ther degree of sinne,Reproofe of them who suffer their mouthes to vtter what filthinesse soe∣uer they con∣ceiue in their mindes. much therfore are they to blame, who belch out what filthinesse soeuer comes in their minde, and being told of it, plead for themselues, and say, I am a plain fellow, I am no hypocrite, I cannot dissemble, I must needs speake what I thinke, as if a man were an hypocrite that yeelds obedience to the word of God, what wilt thou answer, when this iniunction, of the Apostle (put away fil∣thy speaking out of your mouthes) shall bee laid before thee at the daie of iudgement, surely thou shalt then bee speech∣lesse, and haue nothing to answer, thine owne conscience shall then condemn thee, therfore think on it, and remem¦ber the hurt that comes by filthy speaking,Note. both to thy selfe and others, a filthy word is no sooner out of the mouth but it sends a stinke backe againe to thine owne heart, and makes it fowler then it was before, and manie times it doth dangerously infect others, yea, sometimes it strikes such a deepe wound into the soule of another, as no Phisi∣tian can heale, but onelie the holie Ghost, and no medicine can cure, but the bloud of Iesus Christ, and therefore if fil∣thy conceits arise in thine heart, there stifle them, suffer them not to breake out, and to be vttered by thy mouth, least so thou kindle a greater fire of lust, both in thine own bosome, and in the hearts of others, and withall a greater fire of Gods vengeance, both against thy selfe and others.
VER. 9. Lie not one to another, seeing that yee haue put off the old man with his workes. In this verse our Apostle addes the third outward sinne, that is to be put away (namely) Lying) and then hauing ended his enumeration of the sinnes that are to bee put away, he goes one to presse his exhortation by waight of reason in the words following: (Seeing that yee haue put off the old man with his workes) I will lay foorth this argu∣ment when we come to the handling of those words. Now touching this sinne of Lying, I will 1 First, shew what it is, and the greatnesse of it, with examination touching the same. 2 And secondly, the meanes that are to be vsed for the mortification of it. 3 And then come to some generall doctrine. First therefore, for the sinne it selfe, know wee that a lie is when a man speakes an vntruth wittingly, and willingly,What the sin of lying is. and with a purpose to deceiue; for there be three things that concurre in the making of a lie. 1 First, that the thing spoken befalse,Three things concurring in the making of a lie. and an vntruth, that is the very matter of euery lye. 2 Secondly, that hee that speakes it knowe it to bee false, and yet notwithstanding willingly speakes it. And heerein, we are to obserue a difference betweene speaking an vntruth and a lie;A difference betweene speaking an vntruth and a lie. for a man may speake an vntruth, and yet not lie, as when hee speakes that which is false, but thinking it to be true, though he erre and be de∣ceiued, yet hee speakes not against his knowledge, and so he speakes not a lie. 3 And the third thing in making of a lie is, that an vntruth be spoken with inten∣tion and purpose to deceiue.
And these three things euer meet together in a lie, and so a lie is a voluntary speaking of that a man knowes to be false with a minde, and purpose to deceiue; yet that wee misconceiue not this point, know that in speaking some things, one word or one thing may bee put for another, and yet no lie,Note. as it is in Metaphors, and other figuratiue speaches; yea sometimes a thing supposed, or fained may be vttered, and yet no lie, as it is in the Parables of holy Scripture, as that Iudg. 9.8. of the trees conferring toge∣ther; and that 2. Sam. 12. propounded by Nathan to Da∣uid of a rich man that had many sheepe, and a poore man that had but one, and diuers others, yea sometimes a man may speake something not contrary, but beside, or diuers from the truth, and yet not lie, as when parents would in∣sinuate to their children the hurt and danger of some place, as of a ditch or pit, they vse to tell them there is a Beare, or a Bulbegger to keepe them from that place, and that is a thing spoken not contrary, but diuers from the truth, and it is nothing else but an expressing of a concei∣ued danger in other termes, in words of terror, and feare, to keepe their children from it, and this may bee done without fault; for a lie is speaking of that is false, and contrarie to the truth willingly, and with an intention to deceiue,The greatnes of this sinne appeares by 4. things. and this is a sinne against the ninth Comman∣dement, and this may easilie appeare vnto vs to bee a great sinne. First, for that the Deuill, the author of euill indifferent∣ly,  is notwithstanding particularly cald a liar, and the au∣thor, or father of lies, Iohn 8.44. as if in a speciall, and pe∣culiar manner, lying proceeded from the Deuill. Secondly, lying cannot be a sinne of ignorance, but of an higher nature, euen of presumption, he that lyeth sinns not vpon meere ignorance (of which nature many other sinnes are) but against his knowledge, and consequent∣ly against his conscience, if his conscience be not dead, and past feeling.
And thirdly, lying is a great sinne, in that it is not onely  hurtfull to men ouertaken, and abused by it, but it also tends to the vtter ouerthrow of all humane societie, for what comfortable, or profitable societie can men haue to∣gether, if truth in speaking be banished from it? How shall a man know what to looke for, or what to trust to, or o∣therwise,  vnlesse men speake truth to one another. And it is further a plaine euidence of the greatnesse of this sinne, in that when a man hath told a lie, yet he would not seeme to haue tolde it, and why so? Nature it selfe teacheth him that to lie is euill, and a sinnefull of infamy, yea euen swaggerers, and ruffians, such as make no con∣science of any sinne, yet cannot endure to bee charged with a lie, they hold it so odious, that a man that giues them the lie, he must for it receiue the stabbe; therefore doubtlesse, the sinne of lying is most odious, and hatefull both of God and men, though but meere naturall men, and yet lying is a common sinne, and though euery man bee loath to be taken with a lie, yet it is a rare thing to find a man that makes conscience of a lie: what more com∣mon with men in buying, and selling,Lying is a common sin amongst men and trading toge∣ther then the sinne of lying? I feare me the most of our hearts will tell vs, wee haue many times this way faul∣ted, haue wee not many times said, in selling of our com∣modities it is good, yea very good, and no better to be had for money, when we knew it was nought, and worth little or nothing? Yea, to a lie, haue we not sometimes added an oath? which is most fearefull, and who is it almost that hath not bidden his seruant to lie? as to say, such a thing stood him in so much, when it did not? or that he was not in such a place, when he knew to the contrarie? and what more common with seruants then to doe as Gehazi the seruant of Elisha did, 2. King. 5.25. to cloak and smoth ouer a fault with a lie, which indeed is to wound themselues by sinne, and then to seeke to the Deuill for a medicine, no doubt I might yet instance in many other particulars,
our owne hearts will tell vs, that amongst many other sinnes wee are guilty also of this sinne of lying, and wee cannot cleare our selues of so foule a sinne.Two meanes seruing for the mortify∣ing of the sin of lying. Now the speciall meanes that serue for the mortifying of this sinne, are these two. Frist, we are to labour to carrie in vs, not only a consci∣ence  of speaking the truth, but of speaking the truth with∣out guile and without deceite, a conscience to speake the truth in our hearts, as the Psalmist saith, Psal. 15.2. that is, in sincerity, and in vprightnesse of heart; the Deuill may sometimes speake the truth,Note. but neuer without guile, hee spake the truth to Christ, Math 4.6. when he said, He will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time thou shouldst dash thy foote a∣gainst a stone: but it was guilefully deliuered, a materiall part of the text was suppressed, and the rest peruerted, to draw him to presumption; therefore labour thou to car∣ry in thee, a conscience of speaking the truth, and that in truth of heart, if thou giue so much way to thine own cor∣ruption, as to speake the truth guilefully, thou wilt in the end not sticke to vtter flat lies, and palpable vntruthes. The second meanes is this, thou art to carrie in thee an hatred of lying, not onely in thy selfe, but in all others it is made a note of a godlie man, Prou. 13.5. That he hates ly∣ing words, as well in others, as he forbeares to speake them himselfe; if thou fauour lying in others, thou wilt soone come to like it in thy selfe, and therefore a notable way to keepe it from thee, is to hate it both in thy selfe, and in o∣thers, and remember to this purpose what the holy Ghost saith. Reuel. 22.15. that not onely such as make lies, but such as loue them shall bee shutte out of the heauenlie Ie∣rusalem. Motiues stir∣ring vs vp to vse of these meanes.Now to stirre vs vp to a carefull vse of these meanes, and to make conscience to put away from vs this sinne of ly∣ing (besides this, that the reward of a liar is not to bee be∣leeued when he speakes the truth, common experience
shewes it, that one being once found in a lie is hardlie af∣ter that beleeued) besides this, consider wee these things. First, lying is a conformitie with the Deuill, nothing  makes men more like to Satan then lying, lying is the de∣uils mother tongue, and when men lie they are most like to him, and it is a marke of the Deuils childe. Secondly, euery liar in respect of his lying is a loathfull  person, yea abominable in the sight of God, the Text is plaine: Prou. 6.16.17. Prou. 12.22. The lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. Last of all consider we among whom liars are rancked  and their greeuous punishment, Reuel. 21.8. they are rec∣koned vp with the fearefull, and vnbeleeuing, and the a∣bominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and sor∣cerers, and Idolaters, and they must haue their portion with those their companions in the lake that burneth with fire and brimestone, if then wee would not make our selues most like to the Deuill, and be marked for his chil∣dren, if we would not be odious and abominable in Gods sight, and if wee would not make our selues liable to most greeuous punishment in the bottomlesse pit of Hell, with such as are most abominable; then let vs in the feare of God bee humbled for that sinne of lying that hath beene committed by vs heretofore, and let vs euer heereafter bee carefull to auoid it; let vs carrie in vs a conscience to speak the truth, and that in truth of heart without fraud, or guile, and let vs hate lying, both in our selues, and in others, and let our hearts bee taken vp with a feare of God in his holie Commandement that forbids this sinne of lying. Come we now to such general doctrine as is offered vn∣to vs from these words, (Lie not one to another.) First, we are to marke that the Apostle speakes indefi∣nitely, he saith not, vse not this, or that kinde of lying, but indefinitly, and lie not one to another. Hence we may conclude.
That all kind of lying is euill, and to bee auoided, and thus the Apostle speakes,All kinde of lying is euill and to be a∣uoided. Ephes. 4.25. Cast off lying, and speake truth euery man vnto his neighbour: And for better conceiuing of this conclusion, we must know that there are vsually made three kindes of lies. Lies be of 3. sorts.1 First, a pernicious lie, which tendeth to the hurt of another, either in his life, or in his goods, or in his good name. 2 Secondly, a pleasant lie made in merriment and sport. 3 Thirdly, an officious lie, when one tels a lie to doe another good, as to deliuer him from danger, or the like. Now there is not any of these sorts of lying, but it is euill, and to be put away from vs. And the reason is this, euery sort of lying is in it owne nature euill, and contrarie to the truth, and being euill in it owne nature, no circumstance, or respect whatsoeuer can make it good; a lie cannot be made good, though it haue respect to the sauing of a mans life: a man may not lie for the sauing of his life or the life of an other,Note no more then hee may commit adulterie, or doe any act that is simply euill for the same purpose; no surely, a man is not to lie, for the gaining of another mans soule; though a Captaiue vnder the Turke, not yet wonne to the faith, might be deliuered by a lie, yet in this case a man is not to lie to set him at libertie: the rule of the Apostle Rom. 3.8. stands firme, euill (that is) that which in it owne na∣ture is euill, may neuer be done, what good soeuer may come on it. Now some obiections are to be answered that are made against this doctrine, as, First, it may be said, that actions or speeches are to bee esteemed good, or euill in respect of their ends, as that is a good action, or speech that tends to a good end; and on the contrarie, that is a bad action, or speech that tends to
a bad end, and therefore some lie, as (namely) an officious lie made for a good ende, may be vsed. Answer, indeed actions, or speeches ciuill,  and indiffe∣rent are to bee esteemed good, or euill in respect of their ends, but not any action or speech in it owne nature good, or euill, not any action or speech commanded, or forbid∣den in the morall Law of God, and so no lie can bee made good, in respect of a good ende, being euill in it owne nature, and forbidden in the Lawe of God. It is a good speech of Augustine to this purpose, saith hee, there is no fact so ill, but may be defended, if it bee considered not in it owne nature, but onely in the ende to which it some∣times tendeth; that which is most ill may sometimes haue respect to a good end, but the ende makes not that good which is ill in it selfe. Some may further say, of two euils the lesse is to bee  chosen, now it may so fall out that a lie may be a lesse euil then that which will follow on the telling of it: for exam∣ple, a man by telling truth, may happily discouer an inno∣cent man that lies hid from another that seeks his life, and intends to kill him, and so hee may become a meanes of his murther, whereas if he should lie, and say he knows not where he is, hee might hinder the one from murde∣ring, and the other from being murthered, and therefore it seemes a lie in such a case may be admitted. Answer,  that rule of two euils the lesse is to be chosen, is to be vnderstood of such euils as are punishments, or in∣conueniences, not of such euils as are sinnes, no euill of sinne is to be admitted at all, neither will it stand good in the sight of God to escape a greater sinne by doing a lesse, there is no such necessitie that a man should commit sin, hee ought rather to choose to die then to sinne, that fact of Lot which was of this nature, Gen. 19.8 in offering his two daughters to be abused by the filthy Sodomites, though it were for the auoiding of a greater euill, yet it cannot be iustified, and in the example propounded, a man may
auoide both lying, and the discouering of him that lies hid, for he may either be silent, or say he knowes where he is, but hee will not discouer him, and this he is rather to doe then to lie, or to discouer him, though hee doe thereby expose himselfe to danger through the rage of him that  pursues his innocent brother. It is further obiected, we read that many holy men in Scripture haue lied, as Abraham, Iacob, and many o∣thers,  and therefore a man may sometimes lie. Answer, those lies of holy men are recorded in Scrip∣ture, not for approbation, and for our imitation that wee should doe the like, but as their falles and infirmities, and that their faults, and slidings must bee warnings to vs: as Augustine saith, the fall of the stronger must be a warning  to the weaker. Oh, but the Midwiues of Aegypt saued the male chil∣dren aliue, Exod. 1.19. and Rahab saued the spies, Iosh. 2.5. by lying,  and they are commended for so doing. Answer, againe, the things that they did are commen∣ded, not their manner of doing them, that which they did was a fruit of faith, and of the feare of God, but they fai∣led in the manner of doing it, and their lying is not appro∣ued, that was their sinne. Happilie some may further say, how can faith, and the feare of God, and a manifest sinne, stand together. Answer, faith, and the true feare of God, and a conti∣nuance in any knowne sinne cannot stand together, but faith, and the feare of God, and a manifest sinne of frailtie may well stand together:Wicked shifts of Papists to defend or to extenuate the sinne of lying. it remaines then still a truth, that all kind of lying is euill, and to bee put away from vs. I might bend the force of this doctrine against our aduersa∣ries the Papists, who teach, that euery kind of lie vsed in an oath is mortall sinne, but out of an oath, they say, a pernicious lie onely is mortall, and the officious, and ie∣sting lie, are veniall sinnes, that is, as they say, sinnes be∣sides the Law of God, and not contrarie to it, and especi∣ally
I might stand heere to shew the wickednesse of that new tricke of Equiuocation, whereby the Iesuites thinke it lawfull to delude our Magistrates beeing examined by them, with their ambiguous, & indeed lying answer,The like shift of the Fami∣lists. and such a tricke also that vnreasonable sect of the familie of loue hath taken vp, they vse so to winde away with obscure and intricate termes when they are examined, that their heresie can hardly be found out by their confession, but I leaue the further confutation of them to others that haue done it to very good purpose, and consider wee, that no kinde of lying can be defended,  no though it might be for the sauing of a mans life, and therefore without question,Reproofe of such as vse ly∣ing for their owne aduan∣tage. that kinde of lie hath no excuse or defence, which is too common in the world, when men lie for their owne profit, and for their owne aduantage and gaine, men commonly thinke that that gaine is sweet, and comes easily in, that is gotten by lying, but alas, what sweetnesse, or what comfort can there bee in that gaine that brings Gods curse with it, will thy gain (if it were) the gaining of the whole world, be able to counteruaile the high displeasure of God, or the losse of his fauor, together with the forfeiting of thine own saluation? Oh thinke on it, and learne to make conscience of lying, though thereby thou mightest gaine neuer so much, yea, if the case so stand, that thou must either lie or lose thy life, rather suffer thy life to be taken from thee, and that by most cruell torments, then to lie, and so sinne a∣gainst God: for what will it profit thee to prolong thy temporall life heere, and heereafter to lose life eternall, and to hazard the state of thy soule for euer? it is an excellent speech of Augustine (saith hee) thou wilt make a lie, least thou shouldest die, thou both liest and diest too, for while thou wouldest shunne one kinde of death which thou mayst deferre, but canst not take away; thou fal∣lest into two, first, dying in thy soule, and then afterward in thy bodie, and certainely so it is, therefore thinke on it, and consider it.
Obserue we in the next place, that our Apostle saith not barely (lie not) put away lying, but hee addes further (lie not one to another) and it is as if he had sayd, howsoeuer o∣thers are deceitfull in their words one to another, yet in any case doe not you beleeuing Colossians vse deceit, and lying one to another, from this amplification, we may fur∣ther gather thus much. That for one Christian to lie to another, is most odious, for beleeuers and professours of the same faith,It is most odi∣ous for one Christian to lie to another. to lie one to another, that is a great and greeuous sinne, and that this is the purpose of the Apostle, to teach this poynt by this addition, is cleare by his exhortation, Ephes. 4.25. where hee saith, cast off lying, and doth not onely amplifie that by the contrary, speake euery man truth, but hee addes further, that heere though he doth indifferent terms, vnto his neighbour, and this we find added by the Lord himselfe, speaking by his Prophet, Zecha. 8.16. These are the things that ye shall doe, speake yee the truth, not onely speake ye the truth, but speake yee euery man the truth vnto his neighbour, it is then a cleare point, that it is a great and greeuous sinne, for one Christian, and for one beleeuer to lie to an∣other. Now heere two questions offer themselues to bee dis∣cussed. The first is this, whether it be lawfull to lie to an Infidell, or to one not professing the same truth with vs. Answer, no, it is not lawfull, it is not any respect either of person or profession that can qualifie a lie to make it lawfull. Some obiect and say, that the Apostle in that place, E∣phes. 4.25. vseth this reason, why we should cast off lying, because wee are members one of another now (say they) Infidelles, and such as are of different religion from vs, are not members with vs of the same bodie, therefore it seemes, that to them wee may lawfully vse deceite and lying.
Answer,  that reason of the Apostle must be conceiued as proper to beleeuers & professors of the Gospell, as bin∣ding them more strictly to speake truth one to another, but it will not follow that heereby they haue liberty to lie to others, no, to lie is euill, and sinfull to whomsoeuer it bee, but to lie to our brethren, professours of the same trueth, with vs, being members of the same bodie, is more gree∣uous then to lie to others, that is the meaning of the A∣postle, and so his wordes make nothing for defence of lying to Infidelles, and to such as differ from vs in reli∣gion. The second question is this, whether it be lawfull some∣times  to suppresse the truth in part, and to conceale part of the truth one from another. To this I answer, it is not onely lawfull,  but sometimes expedient to conceale part of the truth one from another; so as it be without fraud or deceit, it is neuer lawfull to lie one to another, because that is a negatiue commandement and binds at all times, and to all times, but the other, speak the truth one to another, is an affirmatiue commande∣ment, and bindes indeede at all times, but not to all times, it may bee lawfull and expedient sometimes to conceale part of the truth one from another, as sometimes charity requires that wee couer a multitude of sinnes, 1 Pet. 4.8. and the sinnes we our selues haue committed in secret, it is lawfull and expedient to conceale one from another, and not to reueale them, vnlesse it bee at such times as they lie heauie on our consciences, and to such as may minister councell, ease and comfort vnto vs, otherwise it is lawfull to conceale them from others, because no man ought to bring infamie vpon himselfe, that is a greater sinne, then to bring infamie on others,Note as any crime a man commits against himselfe is more hainous then the same crime a∣gainst another. Many other particular cases I might lay downe wherein it is lawful, and expedient to suppresse and conceale the truth in part one from another.
But let this suffice for answere to these two que∣stions. Now for vse of this doctrine deliuered, is it so, that for Christians, beleeuers and professours of the same truth, to lie one to another is a great sinne,We that pro∣fesse our selues Christi∣ans ought to be farre from vsing deceit and lying one to another. then farre be it from e∣uery one of vs to vse deceit and lying one to another, we hold our selues to be true beleeuers, and we make profes∣sion of the same faith, and shall we be found deceitfull, and liers one to another? surely then we dishonour our pro∣fession, yea, we make it more then manifest, that wee haue no fellowship with God the father of truth, nor with Christ his sonne, who is trueth, nor with the holy Ghost, who is the Spirit of truth, remember we the Apostles reason, cast off lying, for yee are members one of another, true belee∣uers are members of that bodie whereof Christ is the head who is trueth it selfe, and in whose mouth no deceit was found, Isa. 52.9. it is therefore monstrous to bee found liers vnder such an head, and is it lesse then monstrous, and dangerous too for one member of the bodie to deceiue a∣nother? certainely no, if the eye should deceiue the foote would it not goe wrong both with it selfe, and with the whole bodie? and so is it in the mysticall bodie of Christ, if one member lie to another, and deceiue another. Let vs then remember that wee are members one of an∣ther, and therefore ought to loue as the members of one body, and if there be true loue in vs, we cannot lie, nor de∣ceiue one another. Come we now to that which followeth in this verse (see∣ing that ye haue put off the old man with his workes. Our Apostle hauing ended his enumeration of the sins that are to be put away, in these words he goes on to presse his former exhortation, tending to mortification, and hee doth heere further vrge the beleeuing Colossians to mor∣tifie, and to put away cleane out of sight the sinnes before named, by an argument taken from their regeneration, begunne, that seeing regeneration, was begunne in them,
they should goe on in the same, and mortifie and put a∣way their sinnes. Now this regeneration begunne is layd forth by the A∣postle in the parts of it, which are two. The first he cals a putting off the old man layd downe in this verse. The second, a putting on of the new, ver. 10. which put∣ting on of the new man, is further described in the words following to the end of verse 11. Come we to the words of this verse, wherein is expressed the first part of regeneration or sanctification (seeing that ye haue put off) the originall worde is  hauing put off, signifying that the beleeuing Colossians,Interpreta∣tion. had already begunne to put off the olde man, and this phrase or forme of speech (put off) is metaphoricall, it is borrowed from vncloathing the bodie, from stripping off the apparell, to signifie the manner of putting away, and abolishing of the olde man, that it is after the manner of putting off ap∣parell, and by the olde man in this place, wee are to vn∣derstand the corruption of nature deriued from our first Parents, which all of vs haue drawen from Adam, by naturall generation, it is vsuall in Scripture to set out this corruption vnder the name of the olde man, so cal∣ling it by the name of man, because it reacheth as farre as any power of part, as anie facultie or ability of the soule or body of man, and then giuing to it, that Epithite (olde) because it is as olde euen as Adam himselfe since his fall, and sucked out off his loines, and because it is in vs before the newe man, wee haue it in vs from our con∣ception and birth, wee receiue the new man afterward from Christ (with his workes) that is, with manifolde a∣ctuall transgressions proceeding from that corruption both in heart and life, thus then briefely conceiue these words. Seeing that ye haue already begun to put away and to a∣bolish the corruption of nature, spread ouer all the powers
of your soules, and parts of your bodies, deriued from the loines of your first Parents by naturall generation, with manifold actuall transgressions, issuing and proceeding from them. I thinke it meet heere to answer two questions. The first is this, it may be demanded when the Colossi∣ans begunne to put away the corruption of nature. Answer, euen when they first beleeued in Christ, for so it is with all true beleeuers, so soone as they begin by faith to be vnited to Christ, and to applie to themselues Christ crucified, they are partakers of that power of Christ, that sustained Christ on the crosse, euen the power of his Spirit, and that is effectuall to abolish sinne in them daily. The second question is, how farre foorth the beleeuing Colossians, had abolished the corruption of nature. Answer, though by the effectuall power of the spirit, they had abolished that corruption in all the powers of their soules, yet not wholly, but so as there was a remain∣der of it in all and euery facultie, and power of their foules which continued in them till death, though not imputed vnto them, these two things well conceiued helpe much to the true vnderstanding of the text. Now first obserue wee the argument heere vsed by the Apostle, he brings an argument from regeneration, or san∣ctification, begunne to vrge the beleeuing Colossians to put away wrath, anger maliciousnesse, and other sinnes be∣fore reckned vp, that seeing they had already begunne to put away the corruption of nature with the fruits of it, they should still goe on: hence wee are plainely taught thus much. That sanctification, or regeneration begunne, must be continued,Sanctification or regenerati∣on begunne must be con∣tinued. if the worke of regeneration be once begun in vs, we must labor to continue it, and daily more and more to be purged from sinne, and daily more and more to bee sanctified, yea, to feel the power of the spirit daily subduing pride, selfe-loue, vaine-glorie, enuy, couetousnesse, with
a number of such like euill affections, that are deepely rooted in our nature, it is the exhortation of the Apostle, 2. Corinth. 7.1. that wee cleanse our selues from all filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, and grow vp vnto full holinesse, in the feare of God: it is a point no doubt well knowen to vs in specu∣lation, that we are to goe on from one degree of sanctifica∣tion to another, from one measure of grace to another, and therefore I forbeare to enlarge the point. Yet we haue need to bee put in minde of it,  and to bee stirred vp to the practise of it, to that end consider we thus much, that if grace grow not in vs,Motiues stir∣ring vs vp to finde grace growing in vs and if wee goe not on from one measure of grace to another, certainely grace is not yet truely wrought in vs. Againe, howsoeuer the gift of regeneration, the Spirit of grace can neuer be vtterly extinguished and lost, yet wee falling away from the measure of grace receiued, wee therewith lose the comfort of that grace, and the feeling of that ioy wee were wont to finde in the same, and wee cannot recouer it without much sorrowe and griefe of heart. Let vs therefore remember the exhortation of the holy Ghost. Reuel. 22.11. he that is holy, let him bee more holy, let vs not content our selues, with the beginnings of grace and holinesse, but labour to goe on in holinesse, ex∣pressing the same in these words, the Lord hath prepared for vs to walke in, it will be a comfort to vs in this life, and through Gods mercy it shall bee rewarded with eternall glory in the life to come. Come we to the words themselues, and therein first ob∣serue that phrase and forme of speech (put off) wherein the Apostle sets downe the manner of abolishing the corrup∣tion of nature, that it is after the manner of vncloathing the body, wee had the same forme of speech, chap. 2.11. whence wee noted that the corruption of nature is not a substantiall thing as some haue imagined, nor a corruption of the substance of the soule, for then could not the soule be immortall, nor Christ haue taken mans nature without
sinne, but it is a corruption cleaning to the faculties, pow∣ers, and affections of the soule, and such as may be strip∣ped off by the powerfull worke of the spirit of God, this was manifested, and vse made of it, only heere take notice of one thing further from this manner of speaking, in that the corruption of nature, is as a garment in wrapping the soule as the apparell doth the body. We are giuen to vnderstand that men vnregenerate, and as yet in their naturall corruption,Vnregenerate persons are most odious and filthy in the sight of God. are most odious and fil∣thie persons in the sight of God, they appeare before him, in the vesture of filthinesse and corruption, vnregenerate persons though their bodyes bee clad in silkes and vel∣uets, and cloth of golde, yet in their soules, there is no∣thing to bee seene but most loathfull filthinesse, they are such as the Lord speakes of, Ezechiel, 16.6. polluted in their owne blood, and no Lazer, though as full of sores as Iob 2.7. from the soule of his foot, to the crowne of his head, is as loathsome in mans sight, as an vnregenerate person is, in respect of this naturall corruption in the sight of God, for in regard of that, the Lord cannot looke on him but bee offended, it carries in it a guiltinesse of Gods wrath as the Apostle sayth, Ephes. 2.5. vnregenerate persons are children of wrath, they haue in them the image and stamp of Satan, so as the Lord cannot beholde them but in wrath in regard of their corruption. And this ought to stirre vs vppe to consider, and to examine in what state wee stand,A ground of examination & triall of our selues in re∣spect of the coruption of nature. whether yet our soules be clothed in the lether coate of Adam, as Luther speakes, in the leprous and mortall garment of naturall corruption, or no, if our soules be yet clad in the filthy rags of nature, certainely, in respect of that, wee are most odious in the sight of God, howsoeuer our bodies are tricked and trim∣med, yet wee carrie about the stampe of Gods wrath in our soules, and as at all times, this is to bee thought on, so especially when wee come most neere to the pre∣sence
of God, as it were into his chamber of presence, as we doe when we come to the publike worship of God, then we come within compasse of the beautie of his face, Psalm. 27.4. Euen before the bright shining face of the Lord, shining in his ordinances. If we were to come into the presence of an earthly Prince, or some great man, we would doe as Ioseph did, Gen. 41.14. when hee was to goe before Pharoh, put of our old cloathes; we know wee are carefull to lay aside our old apparell, when we come into the publike assembly on the Sabbath day, and not to come in our old cloathes; and shal we be so carefull in re∣spect of the cloathing of our bodies, and bee altogether carelesse in respect of the vesture of our soules? Shall wee approach neere the glorious presence of God in our olde rotten ragges of nature? In our naturall blindnesse of minde, and hardnesse of heatt? Wee may doe so for a time, but certainely at length the Lord will finde vs out, and say to vs as it is. Matth. 22.12. Friend, how camest thou in hither, and hast not on a wedding garment. How wast thou so bold to come in hither, so neere my glorious presence in thy filthy ragges? And we shall then be speachlesse, and not haue a word to answer, and we shall heare that heauy doome, Binde him hand and foote, take him away, cast him into vtter darkenesse, for assuredly the Lord will be glorifi∣ed in all that come neere him, Leuit. 10.3. either to their good, and comfort which thou canst not looke for com∣ming in thy corruption, and sinnes, or in their confusion; therefore remember that thou labour by all good meanes to clense thine heart, and to sanctifie thy soule, and as much as possibly thou canst to put off the corruption, and filthinesse of it, when thou commest to compasse Gods altar, and to appeare before him in the publike as∣sembly. In the next place, obserue we, the Apostle sets downe the corruption of nature vnder the name of the old man, & so he cals it in other places: now hence I might stand to
shew the extention, and greatnesse of the corruption of nature, that it is extended and spread ouer all the powers of the soule, and all the parts and members of the bodie, and therefore cald the old man, signifying that a naturall man is nothing else, but as a man compounded of corrup∣tion, and that the corruption of nature is no light, and su∣perficiall thing: but of these things we haue spoken, Cap. 2.11. Onely one thing further I will hence obserue, and that is this. In that the corruption of nature is expressed vnder the name of the old man, we are giuen to know, That it is not in vs as a babe, it is no tender weak thing, as a little suckling,The corrup∣tion of nature is not in vs as a babe, or as a tender weak thing, but it is strong and powerfull in vs. but it is tough, and strong as a man growne in yeeres, yea it is strong and powerfull, euen in babes, and sucklings, such as yet hang at their mothers brest, though it shew not foorth the strength of it till after∣ward, and when it comes to exercise the force, it shewes it felfe no feeble and weake thing, but of exceeding great strength, carrying to sin with a violent course, as any occasion is offered; yea if it be not restrained it carrieth to extreame outrage in sinne, and hence it is called the Law of sinne, Rom. 7.23. because as a Lawe it doth exercise power ouer all the powers of the soule, and parts of the body; yea originall corruption is so strong in vs by nature that it takes occasion by that which should be a meanes to cure it, to breake out, and to shew it selfe more violent, as the Apostle shewes in his owne example Rom. 7.8.13. Now then, this being so, that the corruption of nature is in vs at the first, as tough, and strong as an olde man, let vs take heede wee suffer it not to growe to a greater strength in vs,We must take heede we suf∣fer not our corruption to grow to a greater strength. for then a thousand to one wee shall neuer be able to ouercome it, and this we doe if wee suffer it to continue in full strength not abated by mortification, if thou vse not the meanes to put off thy naturall blindnesse of minde, but still continue in it, thy minde will become more vncapable of any good instruction: Doe not many
aged persons finde this in themselues? Doe they not find such a dulnesse of minde in them, that they sometimes vt∣ter it in plaine termes, and say, they are too old to learne, as much as to say, they are too olde to bee good, their blindnesse is become inuincible; and is it not so in the na∣turall hardnesse of the heart? Is not that much increased by continuance in the same, by the suggestion of Satan, by ill counsell, ill company, by custome of sinne, and by the iust iudgement of God; so as the meanes of mollify∣ing the word, and iudgements of God, become meanes of further hardening? Too lamentable experience shewes this to be true, and therefore betimes grapple with that old man, thine owne corruption, and with speed vse the meanes that serue for the mortification of it; labour to beleeue in Christ crucified, apply to thy soule the word of God, the sword of the Spirit, for the cutting downe of that corruption, if thou suffer it to continue in thee, thou ioinest hands with the Deuill, and takest part with thine own cor∣ruption, thy greatest enemies, and dost fortifie them a∣gainst thy selfe, a thousand to one, to the vtter ouerthrow of thine owne soule. We finde heere further added that the beleeuing Colos∣sians had begunne to put off, together with the olde man, his workes, (that is) their manifold actuall sinnes issuing out from their naturall corruption. Now in that actuall sinnes are called (Workes) occasion is offered to examine, whether actual sinne haue a positiue nature and being, or no? But that point is more fit for the Schooles, onely know we thus much, that actuall sinne hath not a being as a creature, as a thing created of God, but onely as all other actions of men, or Angels, which haue their being in the doing, and cease with the ende of doing, and are no creatures. Againe, in that the Apostle cals actuall sinnes, (workes of the old man) occasion is giuen to shew, that actuall sinne is a worke not proceeding from God as it is euill, but from
our owne corruption, and from the Deuill, and therefore it is heere cald a worke of the old man, and in other places, the worke of the Deuill; indeed in actuall sinne the mo∣tion of the body or soule is from God, for in him we liue, moue, and haue our being, but the euilnesse of that moti∣on, by disposing, and applying of it otherwise then wee ought, is from the corruption that is in vs, stird vp by the Deuill, I will not further stand vpon these points. Wee are to marke that the Apostle doth conioine the putting off the old man, and the putting off of his works, and hence we may raise this conclusion. That the putting off the old man, and the putting off of his workes euer goe together,The abolish∣ment of the corruption of nature, and of the fruits of it, euer goe to∣gether. the abolishment of the corruption of nature, and the abolishment of the fruits of that corruption (namely) actuall sinnes issuing out from thence are vndeuided companions, they euer go together, Ephes. 4.22. Yea, looke in what measure the corruption of nature is abolished, and put away, and without doubt the fruits of it are in like measure abolished. Hence it is, that the abolishing of the corruption of nature, is cald a cruci∣fying of the flesh with the sinfull affections and lusts, Gal. 5.24. and a crucifying of the old man, and a destru∣ction of the body of sinne, together with a not seruing of sinne, and not giuing the members as instruments vnto sinne, Rom. 6.6.13. And hence it is, that true beleeuers are said to be dead to sinne, the corruption of nature bee∣ing as it were dead in them, and not bringing foorth the actions of sin, as it did when it was aliue, and in full force, and strength in them. And this may serue as a ground of triall to euery one, the corruption of nature it selfe is secret,Triall whe∣ther the cor∣ruption of na∣ture be aboli∣shed, or no? is by the fruits of it. and hidden, and not so easily discerned, whether it bee abolished, or no? Yet the workes of it are manifest, as the Apostle saith, Gal. 5.19. The works of the flesh are manifest: his meaning is, they are manifest, not onely to God, but euen to men that haue the light of reason, and naturall conscience;
therefore by the workes of it trie thy selfe, there is no bet∣ter warrant to thy conscience, that the old man is put off, then when thou findest his workes stripped off, it is a sure token that the corruption of nature is wounded in thee, and hath receiued a deadly blow, when it breakes not out into those actuall sinnes it was wont in former times, thou hauing still, strength, abilility, oportunity, and meanes of committing the same; yea though thy corruption be still working in thee, as it will bee till death, and sometimes preuaile in bringing foorth of sinne; yet it is a sure argu∣ment that it is wounded in thee, when thou goest vnto∣wardly, and like a bungler about sinne, and as the Apostle saith, Rom. 7.15. Dost not allow but hate that thou doest, but on the contraries, if the workes of the olde man bee found in thee, those manifest workes the Apostle reckons vp, Gal. 5.19. Adulterie. Fornication. Ʋncleanenesse. Wantonnesse, &c. or the like, if there be as the Apostle heere speakes. Wrath. Anger. Maliciousnesse in thy heart. Cursed speaking. Filthy speaking. Lying in thy mouth. And if thou commit any sinne with pleasure, cer∣tainelie the old man is yet liuely in thee, and is in full force and strength in thee, and thou art yet in the gall of bitternesse, and the band of iniquitie, therefore de∣ceiue not thy selfe, remember that the putting off the old man, and the putting off of his workes, euer goe together, put off the one, and put off the other, hold on the workes of the old man, and the old man is not put off, if thy life be defiled with sin, certainely thy heart is not cleane.
VER. 10. And haue put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him. Come we to the tenth verse, where the Apostle laieth foorth the other part of regeneration, or sanctification, be∣gun in the Colossians, in the first words of it: And haue put on the new.) Interpreta∣tion.The vnderstanding of the former words, will leade vs to the meaning of these, for heere the Apostle doth still continue his Metaphoricall speech begun in the verse be∣fore, (Put on) this phrase is taken from cloathing the bo∣die, from putting on of a garment, and to put on a gar∣ment (we know) is to couer the bodie with it, and to ap∣ply it to the body: so that heereby is ment that the belee∣uing Colossians had begun to couer themselues with the new man, and as neerely to apply him to themselues as a garment (by the new man) we are to vnderstand that which is contrary to the old man (namely) the image of God re∣newed in true beleeuers, as the Apostle heere expounds himselfe in the words following, (which is renewed) (that is) that new qualitie of inherent holinesse that is wrought by the Spirit of Christ in all his members, which is there∣fore called, 1 First, by the name of man because it also reacheth as farre as any power, or part of soule, or body. 2 And againe, it is cald the new man, be∣cause we haue it not by naturall birth but new birth, by regeneration after∣ward from Christ. Thus then we are to conceiue these wordes (And haue put on the new) as if the Apostle had said, And haue begun to couer, and to apply to your selues as a garment, the image of God, euen that new quality of
inherent holinesse, that is wrought by the spirit of Christ in all his members, both in their soules and bodies: the Papists would force out of this text, that the iustice,A note of the Papists wre∣sted from this text. or righteousnesse by which we stand iust in the sight of God, is a very quality and forme, inherent in the soule ador∣ning the same, and not onely Christ his righteousnesse im∣puted to true beleeuers, this is their note on this place, but it is most absurd, it is cleane besides the purpose of the A∣postle, he heere treats not at a of iustification, either in the sight of God, or men, but onely speakes of regenera∣tion, or sanctification, setting that out in the parts of it, his speech driues not at all to iustification, it seemes they are driuen to hard shifts when they seek to wrest this, and like places to fauour their deuise. Obserue we heere that the Apostle speaking of the re∣generation, or sanctification of the beleeuing Colossians, he sets it foorth in these 2. branches. 1 A putting off the old man. 2 And a putting on of the new. Hence we are taught thus much. That true regeneration,True sanctifi∣cation stnds both in aboli∣shing the cor∣ruption of nature, and also in a reno∣uation accor∣ding to Gods image. or sanctification standeth in these two things. 1 In abolishing the power of nature in all the powers of the soule, and in all the members of the bodie. 2 And also a renouation of them ac∣cording to the Image of God. And this we may finde also plainely taught by the A∣postle: Ephes. 4.22.23.24. That yee cast off concerning the conuersation in time past, the old man which is corrupt through the deceiuable lusts, and be renued in the spirit of the minde, and put on the new man which after God is created in righte∣ousnes and true holines. For indeed, these are the 2. essentiall parts of regeneration, or sanctification: mortification of the naturall corruption, and a viuification, or quickning by grace;Note. and howsoeuer these two may be distinguished
one from the other, yet they are neuer to be separated, and put asunder, if either of these two be wanting, there is no true regeneration, or sanctification. And therfore deceiue not thy selfe in respect of this ex∣cellent,We must bee carefull to ioine mortifi∣cation and vi∣uification to∣gether. and necessarie dutie of regeneration, or sanctifi∣cation, it is not enough for thee to put off the old man, but thou must also put on the new, it is not sufficient to morti∣fie the flesh, but thou must also bee quickened in the Spi∣rit. Happily some will say, this is a needlesse exhortation, for if the corruption of nature bee truely mortifyed, that mortification is wrought by the spirit of God, and if the spirit haue once wrought, that he also will renew in holi∣nesse after the image of God. Indeed it is true, if the spirit haue beene effectuall, to the putting off of the old man in any, he will also bee effe∣ctuall in him to the putting on of the new; yet some de∣ceiue themselues in respect of putting off of the old man, they thinke the spirit of God hath beene effectual in them to the putting off of the old man, when indeed it is not so, as when their corruption of nature is onely limited, or kept in by restraining grace, they are not naturally dispo∣sed, or inclined to some enormous sinne, they haue been ciuilly trained vp, and so they are brought to a kinde of harmelesnesse, and ciuilitie, and therein they please them∣selues, as if the spirit of God had been effectuall in them to the putting off of the old man, to such is my exhor∣tation directed; and we are euery one of vs to take heede of this deceit, for this indeed is to deceiue our own soules, if thou wouldest bee sure, that the spirit of God hath wrought in thee an abolishment, or a wounding of thy naturall corruption, then looke thou finde in thee an an∣swerable measure of holinesse, that is an infallible note that the spirit of God hath wrought in thee to the putting off of the old man, and that thou art truely regenerate, and sanctified. Doe not thou therefore content thy selfe
with thy abstaining from grosse sinnes, or with thy harm∣lesse disposition, and therein blesse thy selfe, but if thou wouldest haue the comfort of true sanctification sealed vp to thine owne soule, then neuer rest till thou finde a new quality of grace, and holinesse wrought in thee, and remember the wordes of the Holy Ghost, Hebrewes. 12.14. Without holinesse thou shalt neuer see God to thy com∣forte. The next thing we are to marke is the phrase heere vsed by the Apostle (put on) whereby he doth intimate vnto vs that inherent holinesse wrought in true beleeuers, is as a godly garment or glorious ornament, and beeing as a garment it is not essentiall, as some haue imagi∣ned, (but that onely by the way) hence wee may ga∣ther. That such as haue put on the new man, such as are  clad with the habit of inherent holinesse are glorious in the sight of God,Such as are clad with the habit of inhe∣rent holinesse are glorious in Gods sight. they are seene of him apparelled with that which is indeede gratious and pleasing in his sight, and though it be somewhat spotted by the flesh, as the best inherent holines is, yet it is accepted of him in his sonne, & that they are thus glorious the Apostle Peter hath made it most plaine 1. Peter. 4, 14. hee there saith, that the spirit of glory resteth on them, how then should they not bee most glorious, and the Prophet Isay speaking of them saith, Isay 4.5. that vpon all the glory shall be a defence) and thus also the Lord himselfe speaks of his people, Isay 43.4. thou wast pretious in my sight and honourable. Now the consideration of this ought to stirre vs vp to a speciall care of inward holinesse,  that our soules may be in∣uested with the new man, with the grace of sanctification,We are to bee stirred vp to a speciall care of inward ho∣linesse. that so the eye of the Lord may bee pleased in looking on vs, and we accepted through his sonne in his sight, it is the fashion of too many in the world, to spend much time, and to take great paines in trimming vp the body, yea some are afraid of nothing more then of inward grace
and holinesse, because it would crosse their pride, and for∣bid the nice dames of this age to make idols of their bo∣dies, and to bestow so much time in tricking themselues, with prancking and painting, they thinke not on that ex∣hortation of the Apostle, 1. Pet. 3.4. but let vs thinke on it, and remember it, that is the hid man of the heart, that is a thing much set by before God, and let vs take paines for that, and know it is not either strength of bodie, elo∣quence of tongue, sharpnesse of wit, beauty of face, or a∣ny other externall thing, or common gift of God, that is, pleasing vnto him vnlesse it be sanctified, labour therefore for holinesse and sanctification, that giues an honour to all inferiour gifts, and by that through Christ thou mayst appeare glorious, and most pleasing in the sight of the highest Maiesty, whom thou shouldest seeke to please a∣boue all the world. Note one thing further; In that the Apostle sets out in∣ward sanctification to be a putting on of the new man, we may conclude. That true sanctification is entire, it is in all the powers of the soule,True sanctifi∣cation is found in all the powers of the soule. it is a putting on of a perfect whole man with all his parts, and indeede if the spirit worke powerfully in vs, he workes on all the powers of the soule; sanctifying grace is neuer effectuall in one faculty, and not in ano∣ther. Therfore let no man thinke that he is truly sanctified, because happily he is enlightned,We are not to thinke our selues sancti∣fied because wee are en∣lightned. and hath a knowledge of the mysteries of the Gospell, when notwithstanding he is carried away with some inordinate lust and affection. Iu∣das was a man that had great knowledge, no question Christ taught him many good things, and hee taught o∣thers, yet was he a man vnsanctified, therefore deceiue not thy selfe, and remember that true sanctification is entire, euen of all the powers of the soule, and is in euery part and member of the body. Now come we to the words following (which is renued
in knowledge after the image of him that created him. Our Apostle hauing layd foorth the second part of re∣generation, or sanctification begunne in this life, to bee a putting on of the new man in these words, hee goes on further to describe the new man, and his description is con∣tinued to the end of the next verse. In that part of the description of the new man that is ex∣pressed in the words of this verse, wee haue these things layd before vs: 1. First, the generall frame, or making of the new man, that he is a man renued. 2. Secondly, wherein that renouation, or new making more specially consisteth, namely, in knowledge. 3. And thirdly, after what forme or fashion, in what manner he is renued in knowledge, and that is after the image of God, who is here set out to be the creator of him, wherin is also implied what kind of renouatiō it is, that it is a recreation, euen a new creation. Wee must stand a while to open the meaning of the words (which) that is,Interpreta∣tion. which new man (is renued) the A∣postle heere speakes of the time present, signifying a con∣tinuall action as if hee had sayd, which is begunne to be re∣nued, and is daily more and more renued, now the word both the originall, and the English word (renued) signifie (as we know) to make a thing new againe, to restore a thing antiquated and deformed to the ancient forme, and beau∣ty, and heere in the Apostle had an eye to that created ho∣linesse, that was in man before his fall, and so his meaning is, which new man is restored to his ancient forme, and beauty which he had in the state of innocency before the fall (in knowledge) or into knowledge, the word heere tran∣slated (knowledge) doth properly signifie acknowledge∣ment, and so the Apostles meaning is into an acknow∣ledgement, or into an effectuall knowledge of God, of his
will reuealed, and of that which is to bee knowne and ac∣knowledged of true beleeuers: after the image of him that created him (that is) after the image of God, and for the better vnderstanding of these words, wee must know that the image of God in man generally taken, is a conformity or likenesse of man to God, as Moses brings in the Lord speaking. Gen. 1.26. Let vs make man in our image according to our likenesse) and conformity, or likenesse to God stands in two things. In likenesse vnto him 1. In happinesse. 2. In holinesse. The first of those is not heere meant, but onely the se∣cond: for so the Apostle teacheth plainely: Ephes. 4.24. put on the new man, which after God (that is) in Gods image is created in righteousnesse, and true holinesse, so then this is the meaning of the Apostle, that the new man is renued in such manner as is effectuall to a conformity or likenesse with God in holinesse (that created him) those words inti∣mate thus much, that the new man is as a new creature of God, thus then we are to conceaue these words (which is renued in knowledge after the image of him that created him) as if the Apostle had said. Which new man is daily restored to his ancient forme and beauty euen into an acknowledgement of God, of his will reuealed, and of that which is to bee knowne and ac∣knowledged of euery true beleeuer, yea into a knowledge in such manner as is effectuall to a conformity or likenesse with God in holinesse, which new man the Lord hath fra∣med in you as a new creature. We are heere in the first place to marke, that the Apo∣stle in describing the new man, saith hee is a man renued, a man made new againe giuing vs to vnderstand. That the new man heer spoken of (that is) the quality of inherent holines, or the image of God, is not now simply
new, but was once made before,Inherent holi∣nesse or Gods image now in man was in man once be∣fore and is now renued in him. and was in man once be∣fore, as it was indeed in the first creation, and that beeing once made, and once in man before it was lost, as it was by the fall of man, these are things agreed vpon, euen be∣tweene vs and the Papists, though they dissent from vs in the manner of the being of Gods image in Adam, and say, it was in him meerly a supernaturall gift, and we on the contrarie, a naturall gift. I will not dispute that question, but rather answer another question arising from hence, in that the image of God was once in man, but lost by the fall of man, it may be demanded. How farre foorth the image of God touching holinesse,  was lost by the fall of Adam. Answer,  the image of God in respect of true knowledg & holines, was vtterly lost, yet some shadow of it is still re∣maining,Some shadow of Gods image is still remaining in man. there is a remnant of knowledge in the minde of man, there is a light of nature, and certaine generall moti∣ons of God, as that there is a God, and that he is a punisher of euill doers, and certaine motions of good and euill, right and wrong, equity and truth, the Apostle saith, Rom. 1.19.20. that the Heathen came to know Gods eternall power and Godhead by consideration of the creatures, their vnderstanding did gather by the sight of the crea∣tures, that there was a God, and a powerfull God, there is also a remnant of Gods image in the will and conscience of man, the Apostle sayth also. Rom. 2.15. the Gentiles did shew the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their consci∣ence also bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one ano∣ther, or excusing, so then there is a remainder of the image of God in man, yet that is not able to make man holy, no not in part, it is like to a dead childe, wherein happily a man may discerne the likenesse of the father, yet is it but a loathsome rotten carcasse, so it is in the image of God re∣maining in man, it is onely left as a monument of that image that once was in man, and to leaue men without ex¦cuse, Rom. 1.20.
And therefore let this bee the vse wee make of it, let vs learne that there is in all of vs by nature sufficient know∣ledge,  There is in e∣uery man by nature suffici∣ent knowledg to leaue him without ex∣cuse and to condemn him though not to make holy, and to saue vs, yet to leaue vs without excuse, and to condemne vs, do not thou think it will stand for a good plea at the day of iudgement, that thou neuer knewest letter, that which many ignorant per∣sons now plead for themselues, to excuse their grosse and wilfull ignorance, that forsooth they are not booke-lear∣ned, will not then stand them in steed, no, no, thou hast knowledge enough within thee to leaue thee inexcusable, at the day of iudgement, and then to make thy damnati∣on iust, the Lord will not then hold thee excused for thine ignorance, there is left in thee a light of nature sufficient to condemne thee, yea thou liuing in the bosome of the Church, and vnder the meanes of further inlightning, and thou not profiting by the meanes to thy illumination, and to the renouation of the image of God in thy minde in some measure, but going on in thy blindnes & ignorance, surely the more iust, & the deeper shal be thy condemnatiō The next thing we are to marke is this, that the Apostle saith the new man is a man renued in knowledge, that the new man is a man restored to his auncient forme, and beauty, first in knowledge, hence wee may take vp this conclusion. That the first thing wrought in such as are truly renued by the spirit of God, is illumination of mind, in renouati∣on according to the image of God,Illumination of mind is the first thing that is wrought in them that are truly renued according to Gods image. the spirit of God doth first inlighten the mind, and indue the minde with know∣ledge of God, of his will, and of all things that ought to bee knowne: Rom. 12.2. Our Apostle perswading the Romans to a transformation, and change, he doth instance in this, that is, and principally that they should be renued in their minds, be changed by the renuing of your mind, and so like∣wise Ephes. 4. hauing bidden the Ephesians cast off the old man, verse 23. hee saith, and bee renued in the spirit of your minds.
The reason of this, that in our renouation, the spirit doth first enlighten the minde, is plaine. Namely this, because illumination of the minde with true knowledge of God, of his will, and of things that ought to be knowen, is the beginning of all the rest of mans holinesse, and according to the measure of renued knowledge, there followes a measure of holinesse in all the faculties of the soule, and in the whole man. And let this be thought on, to this purpose,  is it so that illumination, enlightning of the minde with true know∣ledge,Where there is no know∣ledge of God nor of things needfull to be knowen there is no true ho∣linesse. is the first worke of the spirit, in such as are renued, certainely then where there is not knowledge of God, and of his will reuealed, and of things needfull to be knowen in some measure, there is no new man, no spirit, but onely the old man, and the flesh which cannot enter into Gods Kingdome, where there is no knowledge, but blindnesse and ignorance, there is no dram of true holinesse, ignorant persons may say (as they vse to doe, and sooth vp them∣selues, and stand at defiance with them that shall charge them to the contrary) that they loue God, they trust in him, and they feare him, but indeed they haue none of these things in them, it is not possible that a man should loue or feare God, or haue true hope and confidence in him, who knowes him not in his mercy, loue, goodnesse, truth, power, iustice, & in the rest of his attributes, these 2. things follow close one vpon another, & euer go together. 1. An ignorant minde, and 2. A sinnefull heart. And certainely, a man without knowledge, is euer a man without grace, I haue warrant from the Apostle so to speake, hee hath coupled them together, Ephes. 4.18. strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, ignorance makes men strangers from the life of God, ignorant persons haue no manner of spirituall life in them, let then the Papists mag∣nifie ignorance as a mother of deuotion, but let vs know, that to be in ignorance, is a gracelesse condition, and let it
cause as many as finde themselues in that state, to hasten out of it, it is a fearefull condition that ignorant persons are in, doest thou not yet know God, as he hath made himselfe known in his word, art thou not acquainted with his pro∣perties, with his actions and attributes, as with his truth, iu∣stice, power, mercy, and the like, as they are reuealed in his word? are these things strange vnto thee? certainely, then the spirit of God hath not yet begunne to worke in thee, thou hast yet no dramme of sanctifying grace, thou art yet in thy naturall state, and so vnder the wrath of God, and subiect to the curse of God, therefore if thou tender the good of thine owne soule, neuer rest till thou find thy selfe in some measure enlightned, and to that end, be dili∣gent in hearing, reading, and meditating, in the word of God, and vse all other meanes with care, and conscience that serue to that purpose. Heere further, in that the new man is renued, first, in knowledge; the question may bee, how farre foorth true beleeuers are renued, in respect of the knowledge of God, and of good things. Answer, onely in part, not perfectly in the time of this life, therefore the Apostle heere speaks in the time present, and to this agrees that 1. Cor. 13.9. We know in part, and this may serue to settle our mindes in regard of the mani∣fold doubts and controuersies that are in the Church and may teach vs not to maruell, though men of singular wits, deepe iudgement, great reading (admit that to bee sanctified) doe not see all truth, but haue their errours, we must remember that the spirit of God doth not renue mens mindes, or giue knowledge of God, and of good things perfectly in the time of this life, but so far forth only as is needfull for th good of Gods children. Obserue yet further, our Apostle saith, the new man is renued, in knowledge, or acknowledgement, in such man∣ner as is effectuall to a conformity, or likenesse with God in holiness. Hence we are taught.
That true illumination, and sanctified knowledge can∣not  be seuered from further holinesse in will, in affections,Sanctified knowledge cannot be se∣uered from further holi∣nesse. and indeed, in the whole man, and this is cleare from that place. Rom. 12.2. Be yee changed by the renuing of your minde, that yee may prooue what is the good will of God, and acceptable, and perfect, (that is) approue, loue, and obey the good will of God. And the reason of this is,  because the worke of Gods Spirit can neuer be frustrate, he neuer workes in vaine, but alwaies attaines the end of his working; now the ende of special illumination, and of sanctified knowledge wrought by the Spirit of God, is the restauration of the will to some measure of liberty in good things, and that there may bee a conformity to God, in holinesse in the whole man, and therefore true illumination can neuer bee seuered from further holinesse in the will, and in all other powers of the soule. Now happily some may demand,  what I meane by true illumination and sanctified knowledge, are not all these truly enlightned, who haue knowledge of the word of God wrought in them by the spirit of God. For answer to this, we must know,  that there are two sorts of knowledge of the word of God, and both wrought in the minde by the spirit of God. One generall, and Historicall which is onely a bare  conceiuing of the sense, and mening of the word, and such knowledge may be ioined with Atheisme, vnbeleefe, and sinne. The other is speciall, and experimentall knowledge,  and that is a particular acknowledgement, and perswasi∣on of the truth of the whole word of God, a beleeuing knowledge, and that cannot bee disioined from good af∣fections, it is not possible that any should in truth ac∣knowledge that God is true in his word, merciful, bounti∣full, and iust, and not be affected to him accordingly, and that is the knowledge I speake of.
And for vse of this point, hence take we notice whence it comes to passe, that many knowing much, yet answere not their knowledge in a measure of holinesse, heere is the reason, their knowledge is not sanctified,Many know much and yet answer not their know∣ledge in a measure of holinesse be∣cause their knowledge is not sanctifi∣ed. they know, but do not acknowledge the truth of Gods will reuealed, they are like hard vessels of stone, that hold sweet water, and yet are not sweetned by it, their mindes hold a fleeting knowledge of God, and of his will, but are not thereby bettered, and indeed, many times men by their generall knowledge become much more obstinate in sinne, then they that are altogether ignorant: why doth not our knowledge of Gods iudgements often senee, and of his mercies continued vnto vs, worke in vs a loathing of sin, and a loue of holinesse? Surely, heere is the cause our knowledge is a meere speculation, and not a feeling know∣ledge, we subscribe not in our hearts to the manifest truth of Gods iustice and mercy; we must therefore labour not onely to abound in knowledge, but in spirituall sense and feeling of that wee doe know, as we are taught, Phil. 1.9. Taste and see how gracious the Lord is, saith Dauid, Psalm. 348. Not onely see, and vnderstand the good∣nesse of God,Note. but taste, and feele the sweetnesse of his mercy. Illumination not sanctified may be in the repro∣bate, yea in the Deuill himselfe; therefore let vs labour for sanctified knowledge, and let vs pray to God that to∣gether with the knowledge of his will, he will giue vs the stength of his grace, that our illumination, and know∣ledge may be effectuall, and powerfull to worke in our wils, affections, and whole man, the like measure of holi∣nesse. Gods image mage in man standeth in a conformity with God in true know∣ledge and holinesse.Now further, in that the Apostle doth thus describe the new man, to bee a man renewed into acknowledge∣ment, euen to a conformity, and likenesse with God in holinesse, we may easily see what is the likenesse of God in man, wherein it consisteth (namely in conformity, and likenesse with God in true knowledge and holinesse. The
image of God consisteth not in the naturall substance, or faculties of the soule, or the abilities of it, (for then wicked men haue still the image of God in them, and the Lord sending their soules to hel he condemnes his owne image) but in spirituall gifts, in wisdome, and iustice, in true knowledge, holinesse, and righteousnesse, which were in man before the fall by creation, and now since the fall are wrought in man, euen in such as are renewed by grace, this text together with that Ephes. 4.24. makes this a cleare point; I onely note it in a word, to shew the weake∣nesse of that argument of the Papists, which they vse to bring from Gods image in man, to prooue it lawfull to make an image of God. For thus they reason,  man (say they) beares the image of God, but we may make the image of man,The weaknes of that popish argument frō Gods image in man to proue it law∣full to make an image of God, discoue∣red. therefore we may make the image of God: a meere shift if wee rightly vnderstand wherein the image of God consisteth, we shall easily see thorow this argument, and discerne it to bee but a cauill, for that wherein man is like to God is spirituall, and inuisible, and therefore cannot bee deciphered by a visible image. Oh, but (say they) though God the Father, or the ho∣ly Ghost cannot be pictured, yet God the Sonne,  he being not onely God, but man also, he may. I answer  them, there cannot possibly be made an image of whole Christ, for Christ is both God, and man, and the maine thing that makes him Christ, is his Godhead, which can no way be resembled, and so there cannot be made an image of Christ without leauing out that which chiefly makes him Christ (namely) his Godhead, if we desire to see a liuely image of Christ, and to see it to our comfort, let vs then looke on him in the preaching of the Gospell, and administation of the Sacraments: if there wee see him, we shall haue comfortable fellowship, and commu∣nion with him. Looke we yet a little further on this description, in that
the Apostle calles a renouation in knowledge, and true holinesse, a renouation after the image of God, or a reno∣uation to a likenesse with God, heereby is further disco∣uered. Who amongst men are most like to God, and what men do most of al resemble him (namely) such are most renued in knowledge, and in true holines,Such men as are most re∣newed in knowledge and true ho∣linesse, are most like to God. & righteousnes, we must vnderstand this of meere men; for Christ God and man, is in more speciall maner the image of his father, as we haue it, Cap. 1.15. He is the eternall Sonne of God, and so his most absolute and perfect essentiall image, and in him as he is God manifested in the flesh, God incarnate, doth God manifest himselfe to bee most wise, most iust, and mercifull; therefore I thus propound the point. That such amongst men, such as being meere men are most re∣newed in knowledge, and holinesse, are most like to God, and doe most resemble him, and the ground of this, may be that we finde. Rom. 8.29. Because they who are renued in knowledge, and holi∣nesse, are made most like to the image of Christ, and bee∣ing conformed, and made most like to him, who is the per∣fect image of God, they come most neere to a similitude and likenesse with God, though that place doe chiefelie driue at conformity with Christ, in suffering in this life, and so in glory in heauen; yet it may be also truely vnder∣stood of conformity with him in holinesse begun in this life, to be made perfect in the life to come, and so it proues the point in hand, that such as are most renewed in true knowledge, and true holinesse are most like to Christ, and therefore doe most resemble God. We find in the Scrip∣ture that the Magistrate is the image of God, in regard of his eminency and authority ouer others, and therefore al∣so hath the name of God put vpon him, Psalm. 82.1. God standeth in the assemblie of gods. And man is the image of God in regard of his superiority ouer the woman, and the whole family, 1. Cor. 11.7. Yet both that Image of God in
the magistrate, and that in the husband is but an image that is outward, it is rather, as I may say, in the garment, then in the bodie; the true and most liuely image of God in men in this life, is a renouation in knowledge and holinesse, and they that are most tenewed in true know∣ledge and holinesse, are most like to God. And this may serue to comfort, and cheere vp the hearts  of all such as are truely renewed in knowledge, and holi∣nesse,Comfort and encourage∣ment to such as are truely renued in knowledge and holinesse. and encourage them daily more to be renewed; for doubtlesse they that beare the Image of God in any mea¦sure are deare to the Lord, and the more they are renewed according to his image, the more deare are they to him, as children that most resemble their Father, are most deare to the Father, it is the greatest ioy and pleasure that a man can haue in any worldly thing to behold his owne image in his childe, and to looke on his owne fauour, and fashions, his owne countenance, and conditions in his childe: so the more a man resembleth God in holinesse, the more is hee beloued of God, and the more deare to him as being so much liker to him; yea there is no com∣parison betweene Gods delight in his children, and the de∣light that earthly parents take in their children, but onely for our vnderstanding it may thus bee deliuered; his loue to his children, and his delight in them exceeds the loue of earthly parents, as farre as God excels dust, and earth, sinne, and corruption. And hence it is, that Abraham is called the friend of God, Iam 2.23. The Lord was delighted with him, as one familiar friend is with another; and Dauid a man af∣ter Gods owne heart, Act. 13, 22. And the Saints at Rome beloued of God Rom. 1.7. Howsoeuer the goodnes and holinesse of Gods children doe not profit,Note. or pleasure the Lord (for he stands in no neede of it) yet is it pleasing to him, and not for the merit of it, but through Christ he is delighted in the righteousnesse of his children. Psalm. 147.11. And they that are most renewed in holinesse ac∣cording
to his image are most deare and precious in his sight, both in life and death. Let this then comfort such as are renewed in any measure according to Gods image, and incourage them to labour still more, and more to bee re∣nued. Againe, for a second vse of this point, is it so that such as are most renewed in true holinesse are most like to God,It is most dis∣pleasing to the Lord, when such as are most re∣nued in true holinesse are wronged or any way a∣bused. then certainely it must needes bee a thinge most displea∣sing to the Lord, to doe them violence, to offer them any indignity, or any way to abuse them; for that abuse rea∣cheth to God, whose image they beare, to abase any that carries about the least stamp of Gods image, is no doubt a great sinne, but to abuse them, in whom there is a liuely and large impression of it, in whom a man may discerne euident tokens of Gods image renewed, that is without question, a greeuous sinne, and highly displeasing to the Lord. We know if a man doe any way abuse the Kings picture, he doth hazard the losse of his life, and if one of∣fer violence to an Idolatrous image of Christ, yea of the Virgin Mary, or any other Saint among the Papists, hee exposeth himselfe to danger of death, and will the Lord suffer the wrong done to his Image appearing in his chil∣dren to escape vnpunished? No certainely it cannot bee, the Lord will one day punish such impietie most seuerely, and yet it is a common thing in the world, to offer, and to doe much wrong, and many indignities to such as beare the image of God; yea many times to reproach them e∣uen because they beare his image, and to lay that as a re∣proach before them, and in that respect to cast contempt on them, and to loade them with opprobrious termes. Surely, such persons as so doe, shew whose image they beare, euen the image of the world, and the image of the Deuill, and we are not to maruell at their manner of dea∣ling, 1. Iohn 3.13. Maruell not my brethren though the world hate you. And let them know, that they abusing such as carry about the image of God, that abuse resteth not on
the parties abused, happily poore men, or women, but it reacheth to heauen, euen to the Lord whose image it is, and they wrong such as are most precious in the sight of God, and as tender to him as the apple of his owne eye, Zach. 2.8. And will the Lord so long endure so tender a part as it were the apple of his eye to bee touched and wronged? No, no, assure thy selfe hee will not long suffer himselfe to be touched in that which is so tender, and pre∣cious to him, and thou shalt not long escape his punishing hand, thinke on it whosoeuer thou art that dost any way abuse such as are renewed in holinesse according to Gods image, and repent of that sinne. Yea, let vs euery one learne to esteeme highly of them  that are renewed according to the image of God,We are high∣lie to esteeme such as are re∣nued accor∣ding to Gods image. let vs hold them most deare to vs, that are most deare and pre∣cious in the sight of God; let vs therein follow the exam∣ple of Dauid, Psalm. 16.3. Let all our delight bee in the Saints that are on the earth; and in such should our de∣light be: for assuredly we loue not the Lord, vnlesse wee loue them that beare his image, and especially such as are most renewed according to his image, and that in speciall maner, ye seeke to doe them good, as occasion is offered aboue others. One thing yet remaines to be obserued in these words, the Apostle saith, the new man is created of God: hence it is most plaine. That the new man is Gods creature, he is not a thing pee∣ced,  but newly created, and the worke of his hand aone,The newe man is Gods creature, and the worke of his hand a∣lone. (for it is proper to him to create) and we are able to bring as little helpe to our renewing, as we did, or could doe to our first making. And this meets with that conceit of the Papists, who say, wee may dispose, and prepare our selues to receiue  grace: if it be absurd to say, we did help the Lord,Confutation of a Popish conceit. or could haue done, to create vs; as absurd, and false it is to say, wee can bring any helpe to our recreating and renewing,
as the Papists say. Their is a conceit also of some phantasticke spirits in the world that is met withall by this truth,Confutation of that fancy that the new man in the re∣generate is a participation of the very nature of God. that the newe man is Gods creature; some light braines there bee, who say, that the new man in the regenerate is a participation of the very nature of God, and that such as are regenerate are pertakers of the diuine essence of the Godhead, and they are deified; so they speake blasphemously, wee are to take heede of this delusion, such as hold this conceit bragge much of the Spirit, and of illumination, but in∣deed they are puffed vp with a spirit of giddinesse, and are deluded by the Deuill, this their conceit cannot stand with the truth of this text, that the new man is created of God, for to no creature doth God communicate his di∣uine essence. But happily they will obiect,  and say, that holinesse is essentiall in God and part of his nature, as are all his at∣tributes, there is nothing in him accidentall, and the holi∣nesse that is in the regenerate, come from the holinesse of God, and therefore it is part of his diuine essence. I answer,  though holinesse in the regenerate flow from the holinesse of God, yet is it not in them as a part of his nature, but in them a created gift, and a quality, or acci∣dentall thing: to make this plaine by that which is better knowne, wee know there is strength in many creatures in men, in bruite beasts, I might adde also in Deuils; now there is no strength in any creature, but it comes from the power of God, and shall we therefore say, that the strength in the creature is part of Gods essence and diuine nature: surely then we make not onely bruite beastes, but Deuils also partakers of Gods essence, and deified, which to say, or once to thinke, is more then monstrous blasphemy, we are to hold, that strength in God is essentiall and of his na∣ture, but the strength of the creature is a qualitie, and ac∣cidentall; and so is holinesse essentiall in God, and acci∣dentall in men.
They obiect  againe, that in Christ the fulnesse of the Godhead dwells, chap. 2.9. and wee receiue of his fulnesse. Iohn 1.16. Therefore wee are partakers of the diuine na∣ture to our regeneration. Answer.  In the one place it is expresly said, the fulnesse of the Godhead; in the other, the fulnesse of grace, Iohn 1. verse 14. therefore if they bee not wilfully blind they may see the weakenesse of that obiection. Obiect.  They say further, 2. Peter 1.4. the regenerate are said to be partakers of the godly nature. Answer,  the word is not  but  the Apo∣stle vseth not such a word, as doth signifie the godhead, or the essence of God, but words that may be rendred as they are (godly nature) and thereby is meant such a pretious and excellent gift of holinesse, as doth resemble the diuine vncreated holinesse of God. That is but your ghesse (say they) the holy Ghost speaks  plainely, and he is wiser then we. It is true,  and therefore his meaning is not presently conceiued, by looking on the bare words and letter of the text; but by comparing that with this our text, where the Apostle saith, the new man is created of God, and with o∣ther places of Scripture, wee may not make the spirit to speake contradictories; other obiections they make but these are the chiefe; I wish that such as haue beene tainted with this conceit, would but duly consider on what weak grounds it is built, and that they would in humility com∣pare one place of Scripture with another, and then no doubt, by the blessing of God, they may come to see and acknowledge their error.
VER. 11. Where is neither Grecian nor Iew, circumcision nor vncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: but Christ is all, and in all things. In this verse our Apostle goes on further to describe the new man, and heere he sets him out by the condition of the persons in whom the new man is found. 1 First, by shewing that in such as are renued according to Gods image: neither nation, not outward condition is any thing, and this the Apostle doth expresse in diuers particu∣lars, that where the new man is, there is nei∣ther Grecian nor Iew, their is neither circum∣cision nor vncircumcision, Barbarian, Scy∣thian, bond nor free. 2 Secondly, by shewing that in whome the new man is, Christ is all in all, in the last words of the verse, but Christ is all, and in all things. Now the occasion of this speech, that where the newe man is, there is neither Grecian nor Iew, &c. was this, cer∣taine false teachers sought to put it into the heads of the Colossians, that among such as were renued; there was great difference, some were better then others, and had pri∣uiledge aboue others, as that a Iew was better, and had pri∣uiledge aboue the Gentile, the circumcised aboue the vn∣circumcised, and that it was a great priuiledge to bee a Gre∣cian rather then a Barbarian, or Scythian and to bee a free man, rather then a seruant, heereupon the Apostle takes occasion to teach the contrary, that among such as are re∣nued in true holinesse there is no such matter, there is nei∣ther Grecian, nor Iew, circumcision, nor vncircumcision &c. but Christ is all and in all things. Interpreta∣tion.Come we to examine the words touching the sence and meaning of them (where) that is, where the new man is
where there is a renouation according to the image of God, there is neither Grecian not Iew &c. his meaning is not that among them there is a confusion of all conditions, and no difference of nation, or outward condition, but the diffe∣rences that be among men, either of nation, or outward cō∣dition, are nothing auailable to commend them to God, or to make them more or lesse pleasing in his sight, as the false teachers taught, that such as are renued are neither bet∣tered towards their true holinesse, iustification in the sight of God, and saluation, in that they are Iewes, circumcised or free men, nor hindered in that they are vncircumcised, Barbarians, Scythians, or bond men, and that this is the meaning of the Apostle, it may plainely appeare by that which he ads, that Christ is all, and in all things, for Christ is all in all to iustification, and saluation, and the meaning of those words (that Christ is all and in all things) is this, that Christ is to all true beleeuers, whether Grecians or Iewes, &c. all sufficient, euen in all things that pertaine to their iustification, and saluation, he being made to them, as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 1.30. Wisedome, and righteousnesse, & sanctification, and redemption. Now heere for further opening of the words, two questi∣ons  are to be answered, touching the differences heere ex∣pressed, as First it may be demanded, why the Apostle addes to Iew  circumcision, for Iew & circumcision seem to be both one. Answer,  the Iewes had a double prerogatiue, one of na∣tion, and another of sacrament, one in that they were of the seed of Abraham, or tribe of Iuda, and so they were cal∣led Iewes. The other in that they had the seale of the couenant, cir∣cumcision, by which they were distinguished from other people, and so called circumcision, and both these did false teachers magnifie, and therefore the Apostle doth expresse them both distinctly. Againe, it may bae demanded, why to Grecian the A∣postle
ads Barbarian and Scythian, seeing vnder the name Grecian,Rom. 2.9.10 is wont to be signified all the Gentiles, as appeares. Answer, the Grecians vsed to call all other nations, and especially such as were more rude (Barbarians) and among them they hold the Scythians most barbarous, the Apostle therefore addes Barbarian and Scythian to signifie that not the most barbarous amongst the Gentils conuerted and re∣nued in true holinesse, were lesse pleasing to God in respect of their rudenesse and inciuility, but were as pleasing to him as the Iewes or Grecians. Thus then we are to con∣ceiue the words of this verse, as if the Apostle had sayd. Where there is renouation according to Gods image, there no difference of nation, or naturall condition, bee it Grecian, Iew, Barbarian, Scythian &c. doth either helpe or hinder men as concerning their true holinesse, iustification in Gods sight, and their saluation; but to them of what na∣tion or condition soeuer, Christ is al-sufficient euen in all things that pertaine to their iustification and saluation. First let it be heere obserued of vs, that our Apostle doth not simply deny all difference and distinction of men, in regard of nation or outward condition, among such as are renued according to Gods image, and that among true Christians there is no difference nor distinction at all, in re∣spect of nation or outward condition; but that the differen∣ces that be amongst them are not auailable in regard of ho∣linesse, iustification and saluation; heere is no simple, but a respectiue deniall of these differences, of Grecians, Iewes, &c. this is to be obserued, that we may discerne how loose and vngrounded that conclusion is, that some would force from this, and the like places of Scripture (namely) this. That by this text and the like, is taken away all difference and distinction of men among Christians,The Anabap∣tisticalll fancy that all diffe∣rence and di∣stinction of men among Christians is taken away discouered. it is the conceit of the Anabaptists, that this and the like places of Scripture doe take away the distinction of Magistrate and subiect, master and seruant, and the like, and that there ought to be no such difference among Christians, as one to bee ouer o∣thers
and one to bee in subiection to another, but indeed, it is a meere fancy, this text rightly vnderstood, will not beare such a conclusion, and so to gather from hence, is to con∣tradict the plaine euidence of Scripture, in other places, Isay. 49.23. the Lord speaking of the conuersion of the Gentiles, and so of the Church vnder the Gospell, he saith, Kings shall bee thy nursing fathers, and Queenes shall bee thy nurses, and the Apostle, 1. Timoth. 2.2. biddes vs pray for Kings, and for all that are in authority, yea in this very chapter, the Apostle confirmeth the authority of superi∣ours, and teacheth subiection of inferiours, with the duties of both. But say they, Galath. 3.28. the Apostle sayth,  all belee∣uers are one in Christ, there is neither Iew nor Grecian &c. therefore there ought to bee no difference of men among Christians. Answer,  it is true, all beleeuers are one as they are mem∣bers of Christ, in respect of their spirituall state in Christ, and that is the meaning of the Apostle, but they are mem∣bers of some ciuill society in the world, and so not all one, but there is, and ought to be difference and distinction a∣mong them, if that were a good collection, beleeuers are all one in Christ, therefore there is no difference of Magi∣strate & subiect among them, by the same reason we might confound the sex of man and woman, for the Apostle saith in that place, there is neither male nor female, we see then that neither that, nor this text do any whit fauor that Ana∣baptistical fancy, that there is no distinction of men among Christians, but it is a truth to be receiued, that the Gospel, & Christian gouernment & pollicy, may well stand together.The Gospell, and Christian gouernment, and pollicy may well stand toge∣ther. Obserue we in the next place, that the Apostle here rec∣kons vp the most excellent differences amongst men, as the Grecian who did excell the Gentiles in humane wisedome, the Iewe to whome as the Apostle sayth, Romans the 9.4. appertained the adoption and the glory, and the couenants, and the giuing of the Law, & the seruice of God, & the promises,
circumcision, the profit whereof was much euery manner of way: Ro. 3.2. & outward freedom which is an excellent thing; and he saith that none of these are any thing auail∣able in such as are renued according to the image of God, to commend them to God, and to make them more holy and pleasing to him. Hence we may easily raise this con∣clusion. That no outward priuiledge, prerogatiue, dignity, or excellency whatsoeuer is of any account in the sight of God to make any one more holy or pleasing to God,No outward priuiledge, prerogatiue, or excellency is of any ac∣count in Gods sight to make any one more holy or more pleasing to God. it is not the greatest preheminence in the world, that i of any e∣steeme or worth, to commend a man in Gods sight, I might shew this by many particulars to insist in one or two, was it not a great priuiledge to be of Christ his kinred, in respect of bloud, no doubt it was more then to bee allied to the greatest Emperor in the world, & yet mark what our Saui∣our sayth of it. Mat. 12.48. who is my brother, and who are my brethren, as if he had sayd, what is that priuiledge to be my kinsmen by bloud? is that any thing woorth to make them more holy or pleasing to God? no, no, I tell you they are my brethren, and my mother, that do the will of my fa∣ther which is in heauen, alliance in faith is neerer and deerer to mee then that in the flesh, who euer had greater honour then was vouchsafed to the virgine Marie, to bee the mother of Christ, yet was all this nothing to com∣mend her to God, had she not borne Christ in her heart, as well as she bare him in her wombe, shee had neuer beene saued. Now the reason why outward priuiledges are of no e∣steeme in the sight of God, to commend any as more holy and pleasing to him is plaine, (namely) this, because they are carnall and temporall, and the things accounted of with God, are spirituall and eternall, euen things agreeable to the nature of God. Now then first this meets with an error of the Papists, who teach that some outward callings and actions com∣mend
men to God, as single life, fasting, and voluntary po∣uerty,  yea, they say,Confutation of the Papists teaching that some out∣ward callings and actions commend men to God. that virginity and single life is a state of perfection farre excelling marriage, and in it selfe of such dignity as it commends the person before the iudgement seat of God, and deserues Gods grace, full remission of sins, the kingdome of God, and life eternall, a doctrine not on∣ly blasphemous and full of contumely, and derogation from the bloud of Christ, but such as doth directly crosse that often repeated (and therfore most infallible) sentence of Scripture: that God is no accepter of persons, that he re∣gards no outward state, condition, or dignity in the world for what else is single life, but an outward state, or manner of life, and therefore admit it to be most excellent, yet of it selfe it cannot commend, or make any one more pleasing to God. Againe, for a second vse of this point, is it so that no out∣ward  priuiledge, dignity, or excellency, is of any account in Gods sight, nor doth make holy and pleasing to him, Oh then iudge not of Gods fauour by the outward fashion of the person of any man,We are not to iudge of Gods fauour by the out∣ward fashion of any mans person. deeme not such a man holy or highly fauoured of God, because hee is encreased in wealth, honoured in the world, or the like, doe not thou so iudge of thy selfe, think not highly of thy selfe in regard of birth, honour, wealth, fauour, or any outward excellencie whatsoeuer, it is not any of these or the like, that doth com∣mend thee to God, and make thee pleasing to him, thou art indeed to praise God for any excellency or preferment he hath vouchsafed vnto thee, and hauing assurance of Gods fauor in Christ, thou mayst lawfully enioy it, for God giues to his children, together with the outward blessing, ioy, in the fruition and vse of it, Eccl. 5.18.19. but yet take heed thou boast not thy selfe, and lift not vp thy selfe in that re∣spect with God, as if that outward good thing did make thee pleasing to God; no, no, remember it, it is not any outward preferment whatsoeuer, no, not in religion, that in it selfe makes thee holy and pleasing to God, it was the
conceit of the people of God in ancient time, that they were highly in Gods fauour, because they had Gods Temple, & his outward worship amongst them, Ier. 7.4. they cried out, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, & is it not the conceit of too many in our daies? do not many blesse themselues, and thinke themselues highly in Gods fauour, only because they haue beene baptized, and they enioy the ministrie of the word, & are made partakers of the outward Sacrament? Oh deceiue not thy selfe whosoeuer thou art, these things as they are onely outward priuiledges which thou enioyest, and happily others want, do not make thee holy and pleasing to God, or neerer to heauen, no thou maist haue & enioy these & perish, yea, they may be to thee seals of deeper condemnation, euer think on it, that it is not any outward priuiledge, no not in religion, that can of it self make thee pleasing to God, and therefore doe not lift vp thy selfe in regard of the fruition of outward priuiledges of religion, neue rest till thou haue further assurance of Gods fauour, then the enioyment, and outwatd vse of them. Obserue yet further, that the Apostle heere reckons vp the meanest differences amongst men (as vncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, who were most rude bond-seruants, who were not such as amongst vs serue for wages, or ap∣prentices, but bond slaues, which were wholly their ma∣sters, and reckoned as part of his goods Exod. 21.21. and he saith, none of these hinder such as are renued according to Gods image, as concerning holinesse, iustification in the sight of God, and saluation: hence then wee may take vp  this conclusion. No outward want or base∣nesse doth in it selfe make men lesse ho∣ly or lesse pleasing to God. Reason.That no outward want or meanes whatsoeuer, doth in it selfe hinder men in respect of holinesse, no basenesse, either of nation, or outward condition, doth in it selfe make men lesse holy, or lesse pleasing to God. And this is built on the same ground with the former conclusion. Because no outward thing is of any account with God to make more or lesse holy, and hence it is that the Apostle
doth cheere vp such as be of meaner condition, 1. Cor. 7.21.22. Art thou called being a seruant, care not for it. Let not that discourage thee, thou art as pleasing to God, as a freeman, For hee that is called in the Lord being a seruant, is the Lords freeman. I might adde to this other places of Scripture, but no doubt wee will easily yeelde this to be a truth. And the vse of it is that which the Apostle teacheth in the place before cited,  it serues for the comfort of such as be of meane condition in the world, it may teach them, not to bee deiected, and cast downe in regard of their meane, and poore condition, their hard condition (which is not in them to change) may happily depriue them of many priuiledges, and benefits belonging to this life, yet it nothing at all hindereth them in spirituall and heauen∣lie things. What dost thou then, thou art that poore, and despised in the world, what dost thou vexing thy selfe with consideration of thy meane estate? art thou renued ac∣cording to Gods image?Such as be of poore and meane condi∣tion in the world,,, are to be cheered vp in this, that their hand cō∣dition hinde∣reth them not in spirituall and heauenly things they being renew∣ed according to Gods image. then lift vp thine eies, and cheere vp thine heart, with the sight of that honour belongs to thee. I may safely tell thee, thou art as high in grace and fauour with God, as the greatest Monarch in the world. A sweete comfort for all poore and silly soules, on whom proud rufflers looke so bigge, as if they were not worthy to wipe their shooes: well, care not for their contempt, comfort thy selfe with this, if thou be renewed according to Gods image, thou art as high in Gods fauour, as the greatest in the world, and thinke on that to thy com∣fort. Now, heere a doubtA doubt. is to be answered, in that no excel∣lency, or meanes of outward condition is of any account with God, to make men more or lesse holy, and pleasing to God: some may doubt of this, and say, there is diffe∣rence of the workes of men renued, in regard of outward state and condition, as the worke of a Minister, or Magi∣strate is farre more excellent then the worke of a meane
Artificer, and the Lord hath promised, and will crowne some with a greater degree of glory in heauen then others, Daniel 12.3. They that turne many to righteousnesse shall shine as the starres for euer and euer. Therefore it may seeme that euen outward states, and conditions of men, are of some account with God. To this I answer,  it is true indeed, if we compare worke to worke, there is difference betwixt one worke, and an∣other: and no doubt there shall bee degrees of glory in heauen according to their kinds, but neither one worke nor other doth make men more accepted in the sight of God, the Lord in mercy hath promised, and will reward the works of true beleeuers, with different degrees of glorie, according to the kind and quality of them, but not any worke whatsoeuer, be it neuer so excellent, or by whomsoeuer it is done, doth make a man holy and accep∣ted of the Lord, and consequently no outward state is of account with him to make men accepted with him, or more or lesse to iustifie them in his sight. Now proceede wee to such other points of instruction as are hence offered vnto vs; marke wee further that the Apostle saith, where the new man is, where renouation is according to the image of God, there Christ is all, there Christ is al-sufficient, as concerning acceptation with God, and iustification in his sight. I might heere take occasion to shewe that all-sufficiency to iustification in Gods sight, euen to the iustification of such as are renewed in knowledge after the image of God, is onely found in Christ, and that there is not as the Papists teach, A first, iustification by Christ. And a second, by the workes of the regene∣rate. But this wee haue heeretofore touched, and it is not so proper to this place, but the point more agreeable to the purpose of the Apostle heere laid before vs, is this. We may plainely see that Christ is all-sufficient to such
as are renewed according to Gods Image, such as are re∣newd  in knowledge, and true holinesse, to them is Christ al-sufficient, to them is Christ the supplie of whatsoeuer can be wanting,Christ is all sufficient to them that are renued accor∣ding to Gods image supply∣ing to them whatsoeuer can bee wan∣ting, and ma∣king them ac∣cepted in Gods sight. if they be vncircumcised, Christ is circum∣cision to them; yea, a more excellent circumcision then the Iewes had; if they be Schythians, Christ is insteed of ciuility to them, and he is their perfect wisdome; if they be seruants, he is their perfect freedome; in a word, Christ is euery way sufficient to them that are sanctified, and re∣newed according to Gods image, to make them accepted and pleasing to the Lord, 1. Cor. 1.30. the Apostle saith, Yee are of him, (that is) of God, and his meaning is, ye are begotten of God, regenerate by his Spirit, and renewed, as may appeare by the same phrase, 1. Iohn 4 4. Yee are of God, and haue ouercome them, for greater is hee that is in you, then he that is in the world. Vnderstanding the Spirit of God; so then the Apostles meaning in saying (yee are of him) is this, yee are regenerate, and begotten anew of the Spirit of God in Christ Iesus, and then to this the A∣postle subioines who of God is made to vs, euen to vs that are so regenerate, and renewed; Wisdome, perfect holinesse, sanctification: and redemption. Heb. 10.14. The holy Ghost saith, That with one offering hath he consecrated for euer them that are sanctified) Christ hath consecrated, or (as the word is) perfected for euer them that are sanctified. A plaine proofe of this, that to them that are sanctified, and renued according to the image of God, Christ is all sufficient, and full perfection. Let this bee laid vp as a ground of excellent comfort in  the hearts of all such as are truely renued by the spirit of God, it onely serues to cheere vp the hearts of all such as are truely sanctified in any measure; they finde and feele in themselues great wants, and a world of imperfections,Comfort to such as are truly sanctifi∣ed against the feeling of great wants and imperfe∣ctions in themselues. and they many times sigh and grone vnder them, but let them not be too much deiected, let not the consideration of thy wants ouerwhelme thee, and swallow thee vp, art
thou in any measure renued according to Gods image? hath the spirit of God beene powerfull in thee, to the abo∣lishment of thy corruption, and to thy renouation in some measure renewing thee in knowledge, and true holinesse? Oh then, let not the sight of thy wants, and imperfections vtterly cast thee down; remember that thy renouation ac∣cording to Gods image doth giue thee assurance, that Christ is to thee al-sufficient; thou art indeed to labor, and striue to cast off thy wants, and infirmities, and dailie more and more to be renued in knowledge, and holines, the more thou art renewed, the more will be thy comfort & the greater thy assurance that Christ is to thee al-suffici∣ent, according to the exhortation of the Apostle, 2 Pet. 1.10. Giue diligence to make your calling, and election sure. But if thou finde thy selfe oppressed, and kept downe with the remainder of thy corruption, that thou canst not aspire to that perfection of holinesse thou desirest, let not that al∣together discourage thee, and put thee cleane out of heart, still striue thou forward, and withall raise vp thine heart with this comfort, that thy perfection is in Christ, and that Christ is to thee, perfect wisdome, holinesse, and righteousnesse, that he is to thee euery way sufficient to thy iustification, and saluation, yea that in him, and tho∣row him thy imperfect holinesse is accepted as well-plea∣sing to God, and shall one day bee crowned with glo∣rie. And as this doctrine is thus to bee thought on, to the comfort of such as find themselues truely renued accor∣ding to Gods image; so on the other side, let it bee con∣sidered by such as can witnesse with themselues (if they deale truely) that they are in no sort so renewed, but that still they carrie about the image of the old man, that they are still in their naturall state, and condition, they are to thinke on it to this purpose. Is it so that Christ is all in all, euen to the actuall iustifi∣cation of such as are renewed according to Gods image?
Then certainely to thee that are not so renewed, to thee that art in no measure sanctified, is Christ as yet nothing at all to thy comfort,To such as are in no mea¦sure sanctified Christ is as yet nothing at all to their comfort. I say, (as yet) what he may be heere∣after I leaue to the Lord. But as yet thou hast no assurance that Christ is any thing to thee to thy comfort, thou art yet as an infidell or heathen without Christ, and then marke how the Apostle sets out thy state, Ephes. 2.12. If thou be without Christ, Then art thou an aliant from the common wealth of Israel, thou hast no fellowship with Gods people, Thou art a stranger from the couenants of promise, and hast no hope, and art without God in the world: and say what thou wilt indeede, and truth, thou hast no true hope to bee saued. Wicked, and prophane persons com∣monlie beare themselues out in their sinnes, with this, I am a sinner indeed, but Christ his death is sufficient for all; it is true, Christ his death is sufficient for all, but you must know, it is not effectuall to all, but onely to such as are sanctifyed: the words are plaine, both heere, and in the place before cited, Hebrewes 10.14. Hee hath made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified. Such as are not renewed nor in no measure sanctified, to them Christ is nothing at all to their comfort; therefore goe not thou on blindfolded with that conceit, that Christ his death is sufficient for all. No, no, that is but the sophistrie of the Deuill, where no sanctification is, there is no assurance of iustification by Christ; remember it, and carrie it home with thee, Chirst is all-sufficient, not to euery one, but to such as are renewed according to Gods image; if thou be not so renewed thou hast no part in the merit of Christ, thinke on it thou prophane person, whosoeuer thou art, and let it shake thee out of thy carnall security, and stir thee vp neuer to rest till thou find thy selfe in some measure renewed, and sanctified. Some doe gather from hence, in that Christ is all in all, that they that haue Christ, haue all things, though they haue nothing else; and they that haue not Christ,They that haue Christ haue all things though they nothing else, and they that want Christ haue nothing though they haue all things.
haue nothing though they haue all things; which indeed is most true, and of most excellent vse, that they that haue Christ, no misery can make them miserable, and they finde more comfort in the least morsel of bread God giues them, then they that haue kingdomes at their command, and yet want Christ; but as I take it, this point is not so naturally gathered from hence, and therefore I only name it, and passe by it. Obserue we further, that the Apostle saith, Christ is all, and in all things (that is) as wee expounded it to all true beleeuers, he is all-sufficient to all true beleeuers, whether they be Graecians, or Iewes, &c. of what nation or outward estate soeuer they be. Heereby, first we may see, how that text is much abused by some, 1. Tim. 2.4. where the Apostle saith, That God will all men shall be saued.Note Is to be vnderstood not of all par∣ticular persons on the earth, but of all sorts and kindes of men; for the Apostle heere saith, that Christ is all to all, meaning all beleeuing Graecians, Iewes, &c. to men of all Nations, and conditions, and so hee teacheth how to ex∣pound that other place, That God would all men to be saued. Yea, heereby we may see that the Church of Christ is Catholike, it is vniuersall spread ouer all the world, it is not to bee drawne from the fellowship of all nations, to one citie of Rome, or a peece of Europe, as it is by the Papists, or as once it was by the Donatists, to a part of A∣phrica. But on these things I will not stand, the point more profitable hence offered is this. In that the Apostle saith, Christ is all to all, euen to all beleeuers renewed according to Gods Image whatsoeuer they be. Hence we may gather thus much. That the most holy haue need of Christ,The most ho∣lie haue neede of Christ. euen such as are most renewed in knowledge, and holinesse stand in need of Christ his righteousnesse, to make them and their best works, accepted of the Lord.
The reason  of this is plaine (namely) this, because the most holy, and the most renued, are but in part renewed in the time of this life, and their best workes are but im∣perfectly holy, they are not answerable to the strict rule of Gods iustice. Hence it was that Dauid praied, Psal. 119.76. That Gods mercy might comfort him according to his pro∣mise. He durst not stand to the rigour of his iustice, but he fled to his mercy: and Iob saith, Iob 9.3. If man, meaning a man that is holy, or at least, thinkes himselfe so, disputes with God, he cannot answer him one thing for a thousand. These and many other places of Scripture, make this a cleere point, that the most holy haue neede of Christ, to make them and their workes accepted of the Lord, Christ is all-sufficient to the most renewed. And let such as are in the greatest measure renewed, remember that though they bee neuer so holy, yet they stand in neede of the righteousnesse of Christ,Such as are in the greatest measure re∣nued accor∣ding to Gods image, must remember they stand in need of Christ his righteous∣nesse. and take heed of that hellish pride of the Papists, Pelagians, and Fa∣milists, who dreame of perfection in this life. Againe, is it so, that euen such as are most holy, haue neede of Christ. Oh then, how great need of Christ haue others, who are not renewed, who haue no manner of ho∣linesse in them, certainely they stand in exceeding great need of Christ, and yet commonlie they haue least appre∣hension,  and feeling of it.Such as haue no holinesse at all stand in exceeding great need of Christ, and yet commonly they feele not their want. Many will confesse that with∣out Christ all are miserable, yet few feele themselues to stand in such need of Christ as they do: a plaine euidence heereof it is, that thousands blesse themselues in a conceit of their owne goodnesse, that they are honest men, or wo∣men, they neuer bare malice to any, they euer dealt truly with all, and neuer did wrong to any: these indeede, are good things, but heerein manie applaud themselues ex∣ceedingly, and their owne hearts tell them, they are righ∣teous, and haue no need of Christ. Oh will some say,  wee cannot thinke such a wicked thought, that wee haue no need of Christ, why, wee con∣fesse
our selues to be sinners, and therefore wee acknow∣ledge we haue need of Christ. I answer  thee, happily thou dost confesse thy selfe to bee a sinner, yea a great sinner, but it is onely in grosse, and generall termes; seldome, or neuer wilt thou con∣fesse thy particular sinnes, and if thou bee conuinced of thy particular sinne, doest thou not then beginne to ex∣tenuate, and lessen it, and say, that a great sinne is a little sinne, and a little sinne is no sinne? Yea, dost thou not sometimes seeke to hide thy sinne vnder the colour of vertue? As that thy drunkennesse, is but good fellow∣ship, thy couetousnesse, but good husbandrie, thy pride in apparell (which now is growne to a great height) is but decency, and whatsoeuer thou puttest on, or how ga∣rish soeuer thy apparell be, it is but going according to thy calling, I appeale to our selues, whether it bee not so with many of vs? Now, what is this, I beseech you, but to say in our hearts, though with our mouthes we confesse, that we are sinners, yet in our hearts to say, wee haue no neede of Christ. Let vs therefore labour to cast out of our hearts this wicked thought, labour thou to feele thy selfe to stand in such great need of Christ, as thou doest, in respect of the greatnesse of thy sinnes, and empty thy selfe of all conceit of goodnesse in thy selfe, and remember that the most renewed according to Gods image, haue neede of Christ, and so become euen nothing in thy selfe, that thou maiest bee all in Christ Iesus, and that Christ may bee all in all in thee.
VER. 12. Now therefore as the Elect of God, holy, and belo∣ued; put on tender mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meeknesse, long suffering. Our Apostle hauing ended his exhortation to mortifi∣cation, and putting away of sinne, which exhortation was begunne, verse. 5. and continued hitherto: In this verse he comes to exhort the Colossians to the putting on, and ta∣king to themselues certaine particular vertues, and he holds on his exhortation heere begunne to the end of verse 15. and it may thus bee branched out, in regard of the vertues whereunto the Apostle exhorteth. 1 They are either such as hee exhorts vnto simply, verse 12.13. 2 Or by comparison, verse 14.15. 1 And againe, the first sort of vertues, hee sets downe particularly in this 12. verse. 2 And then shewes wherein they are to be de∣clared, verse 13. (namely) in forbearing one another, and forgiuing one another. To come to the handling of this 12. verse, first of all, the note of inference (therefore) shewes that this verse hath re∣lation to something foregoing, and indeed it hath respect, to that the Apostle sayd, verse 10. that they had put on the new man, and from thence, hee doth heere further exhort them, to put on (as it were) the parts of that new man, as if he had sayd, you haue already begunne to put on the new man, therfore you ought to put on all the parts of that new man, so is this verse inferred, as a conclusion on that, that they had put on the new man, & here the Apostle reckons vp certaine particulars, belonging to the new man, which they ought to put on, fiue in number.
1 Tender mercy. 2 Kindnesse. 3 Humblenesse of minde. 4 Meeknesse. 5 Long suffering. Now therfore put on tender mercy &c. and this exhor∣tation is not thus barely propounded, but it is backed and strengthened by an argument taken from a Decorum, in re∣gard of their excellent estate, and that expressed in three things, that they were. 1 Elect of God. 2 Holy. And 3 Beloued. And therefore it was meet and conuenient, that they should carry themselues answerable to such an excellent dignity, Now therefore (sayth the Apostle) as the Elect of God, holy and beloued &c. and so we see the dependance of this verse, on that which went before, together with the ge∣nerall matter contained in the same. Interpreta∣tion.Come wee to the words of it; In the originall the words runne thus, put on therefore as the Elect of God, &c. In that forme of speech (put on) the Apostle doth still continue his Metaphor, taken from clothing the body, comparing the vertues heere reckoned vp, to the parts of that glorious vesture of the new man, or to goodly ornaments belonging to it (as the Elect of God.) This form of speech (Elect of God) is something different, both in the originall and translation from that Titus 1.1. and that Romans. 8.33. and (as I take it) it comprehends more vnder it, and by (Elect of God) in this place, wee are to vnderstand not onely such as were chosen of God before the world was, euen from all eternity to life and saluation, but such as were also in time, by the preaching of the Gospell, called out and selected from the world, and effectually called to the knowledge of
Christ, and to beleeue in him, and to repent of their sinnes, for we finde (effectuall vocation) sometimes thus expres∣sed vnder the name of election, ye are a chosen, or Elect generation, and that he meanes thereby vocation,1. Pet. 2, 9. it is plaine in the end of that verse, that yee should shew foorth the vertues of him that hath called you out of darkenesse into his maruellous light, now this election in time (namely) effectuall vocati∣on is heere chiefly meant by the Apostle, when hee sayth (Elect of God) yet so also as hee doth comprehend vnder it, eternall election, and his meaning is, when he sayth (Elect of God) effectually called of God, being by him chosen to life and saluation, before the world was, (holy and beloued) that is, sanctified by grace, and beloued of God in Christ, thus then are these words to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had sayd. Now therefore seeing you haue begunne to put on the new man as a garment, still goe on, and put on the particu∣lar parts, and goodly ornaments, that appertain to that glo∣rious vesture, euen those excellent vertues of tender mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, meekenesse, and long suffering, as is fitting, and beseemes such as are effectually called of God, being by him chosen to life and saluation be∣fore the world was, and sanctified by his grace, and beloued of him in Christ. Let vs now descend to such points of doctrine, as are heere offered to our consideration. And first note wee the inference of this verse, on that which the Apostle had sayd before, that the Colossians had put on the new man, that they hauing put on the new man the Apostle here further exhorts them, to the putting on of these particular vertues of tender mercy, kindnesse, hum∣blenesse of minde, &c. Hence take we notice of thus much. That euery such as are renued in knowledge, and holi∣nesse  according to Gods image, haue need, notwithstan∣ding to bee stirred vp to particular duties, exhortation to
particular duties, of holinrsse is not needlesse, but very ne∣cessary euen to them that are most holy,Exhotation to particular duties of ho¦linesse, is not needlesse, e∣euen to them that are most holy. this is cleere from this context, and wee may further confirme it by other places of Scripture, Hebrewes the 6 and 9. the Authour of that Epistle saith, Wee haue perswaded our selues better things of you, euen such things as accompany saluation, and then verse 11.12. hee doth desire them, that they should euery one shew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope vnto the end, that they should not bee sloathfull, but fol¦lowers of them, which through faith and patience inherit the promises, 2. Peter 1. the Apostle hauing set before them, to whome hee writte, that the power of God, had giuen them all things, pertaining to life and godlinesse verse the third, yet verse the fifth, hee stirres them vppe to ioyne one vertue to another: Therefore giue all diligence thereunto, ioyne moreouer, vertue with your faith, and with ver∣tue, knowledge. Now the reason of this poynt is plaine (namely) this, such as are renued in knowledge and holinesse, haue in them indeed the seedes of all vertues, yet those seedes are much hindered, by the corruption of nature still remai∣ning in them from breaking out, that they cannot bring foorth fruits as they ought, and they haue need to bee hel∣ped forward, and as it were many times watered by the preaching of the Gospell, by admonition by exhortation, and by other good meanes, set apart to that purpose. And therefore for the vse of this in a word, let not such as haue the greatest measure of knowledge and holinesse, thinke it needlesse for them often to be excited and stirred vp, to holy duties,They that haue the greatest mea∣sure of know¦ledge and ho∣lines, must be content to b often stirred vp to holy duties. happily thou hast as much knowledge as he that is a teacher, yea thou art a teacher thy selfe, yet thy affections may bee wrought on, and helped forward in holinesse, by conference with others of meaner gifts, and priuate persons, & thou maiest be much furthered in com∣fort by them, as the Apostle shewes in his owne example
Romans. 1.12. for I long to see you, that I might bee comforted together with you, through our mutuall faith, both yours and mine, and therefore though thou doest abound in know∣ledge and holinesse, yet suffer thy selfe to be stirred vp to particular duties, euen in priuate, but especially in publike, and to that end consider, howsoeuer thou mayest profit much in knowledge and holines, by priuate reading and conference, yet through the mercifull dispensation of the Lord, much more by the publike ministry, and preaching of the word, that hath the promise and blessing belonging to it, and therefore make thou conscience to attend with diligence as oft as thou maist, on the publicke ministry of the word of Gods grace, as Peter called it, Acts 20.32. which is able to build thee further, and to giue thee an inheri∣tance among all them which are sanctified. Obserue in the next place that the Apostle heere exhor∣teth the Colossians to put on tender mercy, kindnes, hum∣blenes of mind, &c. as the elect of God, holy and beloued, that is, as it becommeth such as are effectually called, san∣ctified, and beloued of God in Christ, heere then we may plainely see. That there is, and ought to bee a Decorum proper to the  Elect of God, holy and beloued, that true beleeuers, cal∣led, sanctified, and beloued of God, in Christ, ought to car∣ry themselues as beseemes those that are called and sancti∣fied, and answerable to their holy and happy estate,True belee∣uers called, sanctified, and beloued of God in Christ ought to car∣ry themselues answerable to their holy and happy e∣state. there ought to be a difference between the affections and liues of true beleeuers, and the affections, and liues of others not yet called nor sanctified, which poynt is much beaten on, and often vrged in Scripture, and especially in the Epistles of Paul, Romans the 6. and 13. sayth the Apostle, Giue your selues vnto God, as they that are aliue, from the dead, and giue your members as weapons of righteousnes vnto God, Eph. 4.1. I therefore being prisoner in the Lord, pray you that yee walke worthy of the vocation whereunto yee are called, & verse 17. this I say therfore, and testifie in the Lord that ye henceforth
walke not as other Gentiles walke, in vanity of their mind, Phil. 2.15. the Apostle would haue true beleeuers so different from others, as that they should, as lights shine in the world, holding foorth the word of life, all which places manifest this point, that true beleeuers ought to carry themselues as beseems them in regard of their excellent estate, being cal∣led, sanctified, and beloued of God in Christ, and that there should be a manifest difference betweene them and others, not called, both in heart and life; and this hath not onely ground in the word of God, but it is also consonant and a∣greeable to reason, euen reason it selfe may teach, that such as are taken out from the corrupt state of the world, and ad∣uanced to the glorious liberty of Gods children sanctified, and beloued of God should demeane and carry themselues according to so great preferment, and to such an excellent condition. And this is to bee thought on by all such as are, or hold themselues to bee effectually called,True belee¦uers effectual∣ly called and sanctified, are to remember the excellen∣cy of their condition, and especially in time of temptation, to keep them from falling into any knowen sin. sanctified, and belo∣ued of God in Christ, they are to remember the honour, and dignity of that holy and happy condition, and thereby to be stirred vp to carry themselues accordingly, euer la∣boring to deck their soules inwardly with al the sanctifying graces of the spirit, and to shine foorth in their liues in all holinesse and godly conuersation, and when they are set vpon by Satan or the world without, or by their owne cor∣ruption within, enticing them to any knowen sinne, they are then to thinke on the honour of their high and holy calling, and thus to reason with themselues, shall I that am taken out of the corrupt wayes of this world, bee drawen backe againe to tread in the same path with them that are going towards hell? shall I that am sanctified, make my selfe like to such as are prophane, and walke after their owne lusts? shall I that am beloued of God, and within compasse of his speciall loue in Christ, by yeelding to this temptation, make my selfe worthy to bee hated of him? no, no, farre be it from mee, I am called of God, and I am
to walke worthy of my calling, I am sanctified, and I am not so to defile my selfe, I am beloued of God in Christ, & I will not so requite his vnspeakable loue to mee, this ought to bee the meditation of all such as are effectually called, sanctified and beloued of God in Christ, and let them re∣member that a knowen sinne in them, as pride, couetous∣nesse, or the like, not onely wounds their owne conscien∣ces, but it brings dishonour to God, and disgrace to their holy profession, it is a scandall to the weake,Note. a meanes to keepe backe some, not yet called, it giues aduantage to the obstinate, & opens the mouths of the enemies to the truth, and to prophane persons, to speake euill of their holy pro∣fession, these things they ought to thinke on, and so to en∣deauour to walke answerable to their holy calling. Obserue we further, that the Apostle ioines these three things, together. Elect of God. Holy. And Beloued. And he saith, these three were found in the Colossians, that they were Elect of God, holy and beloued, hence wee may gather thus much. That where Gods eternal election (for that as I shewed is  heere implied) hath gone before, there holinesse,Whom God hath from e∣uerlasting, chosen to life and saluation, them he will in time san∣ctifie, and to them he will in time make knowen his loue. and Gods loue manifested shall in time follow after, and in time they shall meete together, whom God hath elected to life and saluation before all times, they shall in time be sanctified, and made holy, and haue Gods loue in time manifested to them, euen shed abroad in their hearts, Romans 5.5. for howsoeuer such as are elected to life and saluation, are doubtlesse beloued of God before their calling, yet that his loue is secret, and not knowen to them, till they be cal∣led and sanctified.
On Gods eternall election, doth euer follow in time, holinesse, and Gods loue manifested, and these three shall in time meete together, and this the Apostle teacheth plain∣ly Ephes. 1.4. sayth he, God hath chosen vs before the foun∣dation of the world, that we should bee holy, and without blame before him in loue. 2. Thess. 2.13. hee sayth, God hath chosen you to saluation, through sanctisication of the spirit, and the faith of truth, whereunto hee called you by our Gospell, to obtaine the glory of our Lord Iesus Christ. This meetes with that wicked conceit of prophane per∣sons, who vse thus to speake, if wee be chosen and appoyn∣ted to life and saluation, vndoubtedly wee cannot perish howsoeuer wee liue,That wicked conceit, that if men be ap∣poynted, to saluation, they shall not perish howso∣euer they liue, ouerthrowen for Gods election is certaine and vn∣changeable, and therefore what need we endeauour to liue holily, and to doe any good works? Blasphemous mouth, and Prophane wretch, whosoeuer thou art, doest thou not see how thou seuerest those things which God hath conioy∣ned, and will haue in time to be found together, in all that shall be saued? thou must know that whom God hath cho∣sen to life and saluation from all eternity, them he hath al∣so appoynted in time to be holy,Note. yea, it is a certaine truth Gods eternall election doth worke in time in all his Elect, another election whereby they chuse him to be their God, and Gods eternall loue doth in time work in them another loue, wherby they loue God againe, 1. Ioh. 4.19. wee loue him, because he loued vs sirst, and therefore deceiue not thy selfe, as God hath appoynted to the end (namely) life and  saluation, so hath he appoynted to, the meanes, to bring to that end,Comfort for such as are truly sanctifi∣ed, their san∣ctification concludes certainly their election and saluation. and none come to be glorified, but such as were before elected, called, iustified, and sanctified, Rom. 8.30. thinke on it and remember it. Againe is it so, that on Gods eternall election euer fol∣lowes holinesse, then heere is comfort for such as are truly sanctified, they may hence gather and conclude, that they are in the number of Gods chosen, & such as shall be saued, the Deuil will suffer any man to say, he is one of Gods cho∣sen,
his sinnes are forgiuen, and hee hopes to bee saued; but would any man prooue it, and haue such proofe of it, as may silence the Deuill himselfe standing against it; let him then looke to the holinesse of his heart, and life, and if he bee able thence to inferre, and conclude his election, certainely hee hath learned an holy, and sound kinde of reasoning, and such as will neuer deceiue him, but minister comfort to him at all times; and though the Deuill roare, and tyrants rage, and breath out nothing but death and destruction against him, yet this will be his comfort, that hee is one of Gods chosen, and beloued of God, and therefore nothing can come to him to his hurt, but the Lord will turne all their malice, and mischiefe in∣tended to his owne glorie, and his good, which is a sweet comfort. What that forme of speech (put on) doth offer to our consideration, I haue heretofore shewed; only this much further we may profitably consider in the application of it to these particular vertues, tender mercy, kindnesse, humble∣nesse of minde, &c. That these vertues are as goodly ornaments, and pre∣cious Iewels, wherewith wee are to beautifie and adorne our soules,The goodlie ornaments and precious Iewels that doe most a∣dorne and beautifie Christians. this indeed is that cloathing of broidered gold, Psalm. 55.13. that will make thee glorious in the sight of God, his holy Angels, and all good men. As for that tricking vp of the body in newfangled attire, it makes thee but odious in the sight of God, and all good men; yea, it makes men, and women like to thy selfe scorne and con∣temne thee, yea point at thee, and say, there goes a proud foole,; therefore let all thy care, thy cost, and time bee spent in decking thy soule with the rich, and precious gemmes, and Iewels, that are heere reckoned vp by the Apostle. Now touching these particulars in generall, wee finde that they are all such as are required in the Commande∣ments of the second Table, as
Tender mercy. Kindnesse. Meekenesse, and Long-suffering. Are comprised vnder the sixth Commandement, and Humblenesse of minde: vnder the fifth and this is not to bee passed by without some obserua∣tion. We are to marke that the Apostle comming to exhort, to put on the particular parts of the new man; he doth thus insist on those parts of the new man, that belong to the second Table of the Commandements, he passeth by the duties of holinesse required in the first Table, (and though indeed, duties of holinesse, and righteous∣nesse doe euer goe together, and are to bee conioined in all that are truely sanctified, yet the Apostle here passeth by the duties of holinesse, and vrgeth the Colossians to the putting on of the duties of righteousnesse, to expresse their renouation, and sanctification in duties of loue, and mercie towards their brethren, our lesson hence is this. That our renouation, and sanctification must be expres∣sed, and must appeare, as in the duties of holinesse to∣wards God, so especially in the duties of loue, and mer∣cie towards men,;Our renouati∣on and san∣ctification must appeare, especially in the duties of loue and mer∣cie towards men. for howsoeuer sanctification, do chief∣lie consist in holinesse towards God, yet is it most of all manifested in the duties of righteousnesse towards men. Hence it is that our Apostle, Gal. 5.14. saith, That all the Law is fulfilled in this: thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, his meaning is true loue of men doth euer include true loue of God, and he that truly loues his neighbour, loues God also, and so is the loue of our neighbour said to be the fulfilling of the Law; and therefore it must needs be, that duties of loue to men, doe most of all manifest, and make knowne inward sanctification, Iam. 1.27. Pure religion, and vndefiled before God, euen the Father, is this, to
visit the fatherlesse and widowes, in their aduersitie, and for a man to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world. Why, might some say, pure religion,  and vndefiled in the sight of God who sees the heart is rather inward, and spirituall, consisting in faith, the feare of God, loue of God, trust in God, depending on his prouidence, and in worshipping him in spirit and truth, in a reuerent and ho∣lie vse of his holie ordinances, and in religious sanctifying of his Sabbaths. It is true indeed, pure religion doth chiefely stand in these things, but yet the power of it doth most appeare,  and shew forth it selfe in duties of loue to men; and that is the meaning of Iames when he saith, Pure religion, and vndefiled before God, &c. By this we may plainely see, that those men and wo∣men  which the Papists doe magnifie,Such as the Papists hold most holy & religious dis∣couered to haue no dram of true holi∣nesse in them. and esteeme the most holy, and most religious persons in the world, and as An∣gels amongst men; their Moncks, Nunnes, Friers, and such like, haue no dramme of true holinesse, and religion in them; true holinesse ought to shew it selfe, not onely in holie duties towards God, but in duties also of loue, and mercie towards men. Now they are tied, by their or∣der, to liue apart, from all societie of men, and to spend their daies in contemplation, in praier, and fasting for∣sooth, and not to haue any thing to doe with other men in the world, and therefore certainly there is not any iotte of true holinesse in them. Againe, by the doctrine deliuered, we may see that many  amongst vs deceiue themselues with a vain shadow of holi∣nes, for why?Such deceiue themselues who rest in the duties of Gods out∣ward worship and happily vnto thē adde harmelesse life, and goe no further. Do not many amongst vs content thēselues in hearing the word, receiuing the Sacraments, and hap∣pilie they adde to these an harmelesse life, they doe no hurt, alas, What is all this? What good doe they? Where is their tender mercy, their kindnesse, their meeke∣nesse, their long suffering? These things are not to bee found in them; it may be they professe, and say, I haue
enough for me, and mine, I will betake my selfe to a quiet life, I will not trouble my selfe with worldly cares, and businesses, I will goe to the Church, and serue God, and it may be, they do all these things, they serue God, in the outward duties of his worship, but still they are as coue∣tous, & as hard harted as euer they were, still as fierce, and as readie to be stird vp to wrath, and reuenge, and still as farre off from the duties of loue, and mercy, which can∣not be performed without cost, and charge, as euer before; Is this holinesse? Is this religion? Is this a seruice of God pleasing vnto him? No, no, deceiue not thy selfe, true ho∣linesse, and true religion is that which shewes it selfe, not onely in duties of holinesse towards God, but in duties of righteousnesse also towards men: and the true seruice of God is to loue, and serue him in seruing of men, in doing duties of loue and mercie to men. Thinke on it, and re∣member it, and let no day passe thee without some good worke of loue to thy brethren, no more then it doth with∣out praier, and other holie duties of Gods worship. Come we now to the paticulars heere vrged by the A∣postle; the first is, (Tender mercy. Interpreta∣tion.(Put on tender mercy) The originall words are, bowels of mercy, which is a Metonimicall forme of speech often v∣sed in Scripture, whereby is meant, pittie and compassion towards them, that are any way afflicted, or in any mi∣serie. And heere the Apostle doth vnderstand such a mea∣sure of pittie, and compassion as affecteth the very intrals, and bowels, making the bowels to dilate themselues, and (as it were) to open themselues, and to burne and yearne within. Heere then, not to speake of this vertue so much as  might be said of it, but onely so much as the words of the Apostle doe lead vs vnto. We are first of all taught, that we are to be tenderly af∣fected towards those that are any way afflicted;We are to bee tenderly affe∣cted towards them that be any way af∣flicted. we are to put one such pitty, and compassion towards them that
are in any distresse, as doth moue our hearts, towards them, and doth possesse our hearts, with a true touch and feeling of their miserie; yea, with as liuely a sense of it, as if we our selues were in the same case with them, this is cleare from this manner of speaking, (bowels of mercie) as may easily appeare by the vse of this phrase, in other places of Scripture, Gen. 43.30. It is said, that Iosephs af∣fection was so strongly mooued towards his brother Ben∣iamin, that his bowels were enflamed, and did burne within him. 1. King. 3.26. Wee read that one of the wo∣men that contended before Salomon about the liuing childe, was not able to endure that the childe should bee diuided,, because, saith the text, Her compassion was kind∣led, her bowels were mooued, and did yearne, and burne within her: and we may read of it in many other places, that the greatnesse and tendernesse of affection, is set out by moouing, and yearning of the bowels, and therefore this forme of speech (bowels of mercie) doth teach vs to put on such pittie, and compassion towards such as bee in distresse, as doth worke in vs a liuely sense and feeling of their miserie. And hence is it, that wee are exhorted to weepe with them that weepe, Rom. 12.15. and to remem∣ber them that are in bonds, as though wee were bound with them. Heb. 13.3. The reason,  and ground of this is plaine, wee are mem∣bers of one, and the same body, and the Lord hath laid it as a Law on the members, that if one member suffer, all suffer it. 1 Cor. 12.26. Now before we come to the application of this point,  a question is to bee answered: it may bee demaunded whether wee are to bee touched with a feeling compa∣ssion towardes them that suffer iust punishment for their euill deedes, when wee see Gods punishing hand on wicked persons for their euill doing, or no. Answere,  Wee are at all times to follow the rule
rule of Christian loue which teacheth vs to put on tender bowels, pitty, and comiseration towards all in distresse, being of the same nature with vs; yet with this difference, if they who are punished, suffer as blasphemers, or traitors, and for any offence directly against Gods glorie, the good estate of the Church, and religion, then we may be so far from pittying them, and sorrowing for them, and putting on tender bowels in regard of their sufferings, as wee may be glad, and reioice, not pleasing our selues in the smart of any be they neuer so wicked, but for other speciall cau∣ses, as First, for the manifestation of Gods iustice, because we loue God, and his glorie is deare vnto vs, wee may mag∣nifie, and praise his iustice in punishing such wicked per∣sons, according to that, Psalme 58.10.11. The righte∣ous shall reioice when he seeth the vengeance, &c. Secondly, in regard of others, who at their punishment may learne to feare, as it is said of the bands of Aram stric∣ken with blindnesse, that they come no more into the land of Israell, 2. King. 6.23. Thirdly, because the godly are bettered by their ex∣ample, they are thereby mooued to consider the corrup∣tion of nature, how farre it carries, if it be not abolished, or restrained, and so they are stird vp to a more narrow watch ouer their owne hearts and waies. To returne to our purpose, and to make vse of the do∣ctrine deliuered.It ought to be farre from vs to insult ouer them that bee be in distresse, and to sport our selues in their afflicti∣on. First, it beeing so that we are to put on tender bowels towards the afflicted, and to them that are in any misery: certainly, then it ought to bee farre from euery one of vs to insult ouer such, and to make our selues merrie with their affliction, as the manner of some is, to take aduan∣tage on the affliction and miserie of others, to deale hard∣ly with them, to adde affliction to affliction, and to heape one miserie vpon another, and it is most barbarous and brutish, and after the manner of the dogge to fall vpon
him that is downe, it argues exceeding hardnesse of heart; for the afflictions and miseries of our brethren are visible Sermons, moouing vs to pittie, and compassion, and things seene make deeper impression then things onely heard of, if we then seeing the miseries of our brethren be not moued with pittie towards them, but rather we insult ouer them, or we take aduantage thereby to deale hardly with them, it is an argument of extreame hardnesse of heart. Psalm. 69.26. They persecute him whom thou hast smitten. Therefore lay iniquity on iniquitie, and punish one sin with another, or adde punishment to punishment, which is an heauy crosse, and to be thought on by all such as insult ouer them that are in miserie, or take aduantage thereby to deale hardly with them. Againe, is it so that we are to be tenderly affected to∣wards  them that are any way afflicted:We are not to content our selues with verball pitty. yea so to bee affe∣cted towards them, that our inwards are to bee touched with a feeling of their misery. Surely then wee are not to content our selues with that pitty that is too common in the world, (namely verball pitty) a Lord helpe thee; or as Iames sets it out, Iam. 2.26. Goe thy waies, warme thy selfe, fill thy belly, &c. and yet supply nothing that is needfull; no, no, that is no feeling pitty, a feeling pitty (doubtlesse) will make both the tongue to speake, and the hands to minister that which may bring ease and comfort, and where there be bowels of mercy, there will bee euer a willingnesse, and readinesse to the workes of mercy. And therefore deceiue not thy selfe, if thou bee hardly drawne to any worke of mercy, and it must be pulled from thee as it were by maine strength, by many arguments, reasons, and many induce∣ments, thou hast no bowels of mercy, thou hast no feeling pitty in thee, and if no feeling pitty be in thee to the distres∣sed members of Christ, it seales vp to thee a fearefull con∣clusion, euen this, that thou art not of the same body with them, and that thou hast not yet felt the loue of God in thy breast, neither hast the loue of God dwelling in thee.
The text is plaine, 1. Iohn 3.17. Whosoeuer hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother haue need, and shutteth vp his bow∣els from him, or against him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him? Remember therefore for a conclusion of this, the ar∣gument heere vsed by the Apostle, hee wished the Colossi∣ans, as the elect of God, holy, and beloued of God, to put on tender mercy; so I say to thee, if thou wouldest be sure of thine owne election to life and saluation, if thou wouldst haue an infallible note of true holines, and if thou wouldst prooue it to the comfort of thine owne soule, that thou art beloued of God in Christ, then content not thy selfe with verball pitty, but put on bowels of mercy, let the knowne miserie of others enter into thine heart, and mooue thy bowels towards them, euen to minister ease and comfort as any occasion shall bee offered, and as the Lord shall inable thee. Heere further, in that the Apostle saith, put on bowels of mercy,Workes of mercy must proceed from an inward mouing and yearning of the bowels. we are taught, whence the works of mercy, and the comfort we minister to others, either in word or deed ought to proceed, (namely) from the inward moouing, and yearning of the bowels, from the heart tenderly affe∣cted towards them, to whom we doe any good, Isai. 58.10. The Prophet saith, if thou poure thy soule out to the hungrie. He requireth not onely a pouring out of food to the hungrie, but with the food a pouring out of the soule. 2. Cor. 9.7. As euery man wisheth in his heart, so let him giue, not grudgingly, or of necessitie. Let this gift come from the wish of his heart and that the Apostle there addes (for God loueth a cheerefull giuer) may be the reason and ground of this duty,  God loues cheerefulnesse in giuing, and re∣quires cheerefulnesse in all the workes of his seruice Rom. 12.8. and there can be no cheerefulnesse, vnlesse the work come from the inward affection of the heart, therefore e∣uery worke of mercy ought thence to proceed. euen from the inward moouing, and yearning of the bowels. And take we notice of this, and know that it is not a
worke of mercie pleasing to God, that comes either from ones superfluity, or from the importunity of them that are in distresse, or from example of others inuiting vs, or from a desire of praise or the like, much lesse that which is forced out from torture, or torment, to stop the mouth of a guilty conscience, as when wicked rich men lying on their death beddes, are forced thorow the gripes of a galled conscienceWorkes of mercy please not God, which come from super∣fluity, or from the importu∣nity of the di∣stressed, or from exam∣ple of others, or from desire of praise, and the like, or are forced out from the gripes of a galled consci∣ence. to giue some thing to charitable vses, no, no, beneficence acceptable to God comes onely from tendernesse of heart, and without that, all our bounty or shew of mercy whatso∣euer, is nothing worth; for the Lord lookes rather at the af∣fection, then at the outward action in all duties of loue and mercy, and heere is comfort for such as are of tender bow∣elles,comfort for such as be of tender bow∣els. though they be not able to doe any worke of mercy, art thou tenderly affected, towards the afflicted members of Christ? canst thou mourne with them when they mourn cannest thou praie for them when they are in distresse,  though thou bee not able to helpe them? assure thy selfe, thy affection is as pleasing to God, as if thou wert able, and didst indeed minister helpe vnto them, thinke on that to thy comfort. One thing yet remaines to bee noted, the Apostle saith, (bowelles of mercy) hee speakes in the plurall number, heer∣by teaching. That our mercies must bee of diuers kindes, according  to the sorts of miseries, and often repeated,Our mercies must be di∣uers & often repeated. according to the diuers subiects of miseries, or long continuance of them, It is not enough to minister outward comfort alone, or in∣ward alone, to him that is afflicted both in bodie and mind,  nor to enlarge our bowelles once to him whose afflictions continue, or to one or two, where there are many,How we faile in this duty. whose misery should open and affect our bowels. Now to the second vertue heere vrged by the Apostle, (kindnesse) put on kindnesse. This vertue extendeth & reacheth further then the former, for pittie and compassion is proper to those that are in
some affliction and miserie, but kindnesse goes further: It reacheth to all,What kind∣nesse is. whether in prosperity or aduersity, it is a sweet & louing disposition of the hart, and a courteous af∣fection to all, shewing it selfe in pleasing and good speech, it is an easines to be vsed & imploied for the good of others for so the originall word doth properly signifie, and we find it so vsed in other places of Scripture, saith our Sauiour, my yoke is easie the word is , and it may be rendred kind, my yoke is kind,Mat. 11.30. if saith the Apostle, yee haue tasted how bountifull the Lord is; it may be rendered, how sweet, or how kinde the Lord is,1. Pet. 2.3. and so in many other places that might bee cited. Heere then wee see what is required of vs, namely this, that we put on a sweet louing affection of hart  towards all, shewing it selfe in kind speech & countenance,We are to put on a swet lo∣uing affection of he art to∣wards all, shewing at selfe in kinde speech and countenance. that wee shew our selues affable and courteous to all, and tractable and easie to be imploied for the good of all; That is true kindnes and curtesie, & this we are required to shew one to another, Eph. 4.32. be ye courteous one to another, and tender harted, forgiuing one another, euen as God for Christs sake forgaue you, and Gal. 5.22. gentlenesse is rec∣koned vp among the fruits of the spirit. Now this vertue as it hath relation to the afflicted,How this ver∣tue is to be manifested to the afflicted. it is to bee manifested in yeelding comfort and refreshing to them, and standing by them to helpe them in time of need, and to do them good, Absolon could find it as a fault in Hushaie, that he went not with his friend Dauid in time of need, 2. Sam. 16.17. is this thy kindnes to thy friend? and as it hath respect to others not afflicted,And how to others not afflicted. it is to be expressed as before I haue shewed, in giuing good speech, and in shew∣ing good countenance, and in easinesse to bee vsed in any thing wherein wee may doe good to others: and this is to be considered of vs,  true kindnesse stands not in cap and knee,Discouery of counterfet kindnesse. in bowing and bending, and in outward ceremonies and complements, no, no, that is but the curtesie of the world, it is commonly seuered from good affection, yea, somtimes it is a maske of a wicked and ill affected hart, & a
worke of the flesh neyther is it to bee esteemed true kind∣nes that stands in practise of plausible behauior, as in drin∣king with the drunkard, which is counted a note of a kind nature, or when men make themselues popular and plea∣sing to others by giuing way to them in their sinfull cour∣ses, as in yeelding liberty to such as liue vnder them for all licentious and disordered manner of liuing, suffering them to sweare and swagger, and to be prophane without check and controlement: they that so doe are accounted kind, as ye shall heare some seruants say, oh such a man is a kinde master, doe his worke, and I warrant you then hee will let you do what you will, worke hard all the week, and he will let you run whether you list vpon the Sabbath day, is this true kindnes? is this a fruit of the Spirit? no, no, true Chri∣stian kindnes takes not away necessarie restraint, and cor∣rection but doth mittigate and moderate it, making it more easie to be borne; and profitable true kindnesse con∣sisteth in a tractable willingnesse, in a facilitie and easinesse to bee vsed onely in that wherein wee may doe good to o∣thers, yea in an easinesse to be imployed for the good of al, which is to be marked of vs, for wee may be deceiued with  the shadow of this vertue.We must take heed we bee not deceiued with the sha∣dow of this vertue. Many heathen men haue had, & manie meere naturall men may haue in them the counter∣fet of this vertue, they are kind to such as are kind to them, and friendlie to their friends, but true kindnesse must goe further, wee must therein be like God himselfe, his exam∣ple must wee follow Luke 6.35. hee is kinde vnto the vn∣kind, and to the euill, so are wee to bee kind to our ene∣mies and those that hate vs, and there must be in vs an easi∣nesse to bee vsed for the good of all whatsoeuer they bee, friends or foes, remember wee that. And now to stirre vs vp to the putting on of this excel∣lent vertue, consider with me these two things.Two Motiues stirring vs vp to put on kindnesse. First, true Christian kindnesse is a speciall meanes to winne the hearts of all vnto vs, hee that is truely kind, tra∣ctable,  and easie to bee vsed for the good of others, takes
the best way to knit the hearts of all especially of all good men vnto him, yea to seale vp to his owne soule an assu∣rance of Gods fauour and louing kindnesse, the shadow of this vertue in heathen men hath beene of that force that thereby they haue maruellouslie carried away the hearts of men, and hence it is that manie prophane and worldlie men doe much affect this vertue, or at least the shadow of it. Againe consider on the other side that whatsoeuer o∣ther good qualities a man hath, yet if he be of an vnkinde and churlish nature he shal neuer winne the hearts of men, nor euer preuaile in any worthy seruice, in Church, in common-wealth or family, a sower, cynicall, and churlish behauiour is distastfull to euerie one. How was Dauid gal∣led with Nabals churlish answere? hee endured with pati∣ence Sauls laying waite for his life, and Shemeies cursing of him, but he could not endure that answere of Nabal; and had not Abigail met him and perswaded him to the con∣trary, hee had not left to Nabal by the dawning of the day any of his house to pisse against the wall. If then we desire to be loued of all and especially of our brethren, all good men, yea to bee assured of Gods fauour and louing kindnesse towards vs, yea so to be loued of all men, as may be for our own good, and the good of others. Let vs put on a louing and kinde disposition of heart to∣wards our brethren, yea an easinesse and tractable willing∣nesse, as much as we are able to bee employed for the good of al, whether they be kind or vnkind to vs; and remember that this vertue of kindnesse is of most excellent vse in eue∣ry woorthy seruice either in Church, common-wealth or family, it winnes mens hearts to vs, and the hearts beeing wonn they are easily wrought on to any good purpose. Come we to the third vertue (humblenes of mind) put on (saith the Apostle) humblenesse of mind, touching this vertue know we That humblenesse of minde, is a meane and moderate
estimation of our selues, and of all the good gifts and gra∣ces we haue, either of body or minde. It hath a double relation,It hath a dou∣ble relation. either to God, and then it is an acknowledgement of our nothingnes (as I may so say) and that all we haue is from God, or it hath respect to men, and then it is an esteeming of others better then our selues, namely, such as are truely called, and Gods children, and this is the humblenesse of minde heere meant. Heere then first we see, wee are to carry in vs an humble  mind, a meane and moderate estimation of our selues in re∣spect of other men,We are to carry in vs, a meane and moderate e∣stimation of our selues in respect of o∣ther men. we are to esteem others better then our selues, and to this purpose the Apostle saith, Rom. 12.16. be not high minded, but make your selues equall to them of the lower sort, and yet more plainly, Phil. 2.3. let euery man in meeknes of mind, esteeme other better then himselfe: I might adde to these, other places of Scripture to shew that this is our duty, but I chuse rather to stirre vs vp to the practise of it, for it may be we will easily yeeld that this is our dutie, that wee ought euery man in humblenesse of minde, to esteeme o∣thers better then our selues. Yet this vertue is hard to obtaine,This vertue is hard to ob∣taine. it is contrary to nature it is agreeable to nature, to be proud of good things, as ap∣peares by Herod, Act. 12.13. and Saul, who was offended that Dauid was preferd before him in the song, 1. Sam. 18.7. Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand, yea, men are naturally proud of the shews of things that are not in them, of glosses and shadowes of good things, yea,Note. and sometimes when they know they are not in them, but claw∣backes and flatterers do ascribe to them, and therefore to stirre vs forward, in the practise of this duty, euen in hum∣blenesse of minde,Two mo∣tiues stirring vs vp to hum∣blenesse of minde. to esteeme others better then our selues, consider with me onely these two things. First, we may see many good things in others, which we  want, for God giues his graces not all to any one, least hee should haue matter of pride, but some to euery one, that none should be subiect to contempt, yea, we may somtimes see
those good things that be in vs in greater measure in others, then they be in vs. Againe, consider that wee are priuy to more sinne and corruption in our selues, then we can be in others. How many euill things are in vs, if wee search and ran∣sacke our owne hearts, which may worthily make vs hang down our heads, and esteem more basely of our selues then any other man can with any colour of reason speake or hinke of vs? let these things be duly considered, and they will helpe vs to hold downe our harts in humility, and take from vs all matter of lifting vp our selues aboue others; a∣way then with those vaine and foolish words, I am as good as thou. I am his better, and the like; awaie with such proud and loftie thoughts, and let vs put on this glorious orna∣ment of humilitie; let vs in humblenesse of minde euerie one esteeme another better then himselfe. Obserue we in the next place, the forme of speech heere vsed by the Apostle, he saith not, put on humility, but hum∣blenesse of minde, hence we are taught, That true humility is seated in the heart and mind,True humili∣ty is seated in the heart and minde. they indeed are truely humble, that are of humble hearts and mindes. And thus we read, that Dauid cleering himselfe of am∣bition, and protesting his humilitie before the Lord. Psal. 131.1. saith, mine heart is not haughty, first he beginnes with the lowlinesse of his heart, and then descends to protest his humble outward carriage, it is the exhortation of the Apo∣stle Peter 1. Pet. 5.5. deck your selues inwardly in lowlines of minde: for God resisteth the proud, & giueth grace vnto the humble, let your humilitie be inwardly in hart & mind. First this doth discouer to vs, that the Papists doe but bleare the eies of the world with a counterfet shew of humi∣litie,Popish humi∣lity is coun∣terfet. they would make the world beleeue that some among them are the most humble and mortified men aliue, in that forsooth they forfake lands and goods, and put on the ha∣bit of a poore monke or frier, but indeed there is no true hu∣mility
in them, for vnder their shew of humility, they nou∣rish in their hearts, the greatest pride that can be, euen a vain confidence in themselues, challenging to themselues a state of perfection. Againe, this doctrine, that true humility is seated in the  heart,The counter∣fet shew of humility that is in the world, disco∣uered. doth vncase and pull off the visor of humilty from the face of many in the world, who make a faire shew, & carry a faire pretext of humilitie, that forsooth they can be con∣tent to lay their hands vnder the feet of their brethren, to performe the basest office to the meanest, when indeed they meane nothing lesse, happilie they would lay their hands vnder their feet to supplant them, or as Absalon did. 2 Sa. 15.5. make themselues plausible and familiar to strengthen their hands in bad purposes, let such know, that as they put on the counterfet of so excellent a grace as humility, and varnish ouer their wicked intents with so faire a glosse, that their hypocrisie in this respect is the greater, and without repentance they shall receiue the reward of such as couer sinne with a lie, euen punishment double in proportion to that which is due to open offenders, for their sinne is dou∣bled and enfolded one within another, and their punish∣ment shall be answerable. It remaines that wee answere a popish cauillA popish ca∣uill. occasioned, from this, that we are to put on humblenesse of minde, they of that faction, cry out against vs and say; we be farre from humblenesse of minde, in that we hould certainty of salua∣tion by faith, say they, you are proud and presumptuous, & carry your selues too high vpon that excellent gift of faith, which indeed is a meere cauill, and heerein they deale most iniuriouslie with vs, they may if they will obserue that we build not certainetie of saluation vpon the gift of faith, or vpon the dignity of that gift, as they doe on the merit of works of grace, hauing (as they say) power giuen of Christ to merit, for that were arrogancie indeed, but we build as∣surance of saluation by faith, on the promise of God pro∣pounding mercy, remission of sinnes, iustification, life and
saluation, that by true faith, lay hold on the death and obe∣dience of his sonne incarnate, which is a rocke that neuer can be shaken, therfore we cannot be iustly taxed with pride and presumption, for holding certainty of saluation by faith apprehending the promise of mercy in the actiue and pas∣siue obedience of Christ. Now to the 4. vertue here vrged by the Apostle (meeknes) put on meeknes; touching this vertue, that we may rightly conceiue it, know we that meeknes in a generall acceptionWhat meek∣nesse is in a generall ac∣ception. of the word is a calmnes & quietnes of heart and minde, a settled & quiet disposition of mind; free from perturbation, when the mind is settled & quiet, free from passion & disor∣dered affections, then in a generall sence there is meeknes. Now this calm & quiet disposition of hart & mind hath a double relation,It hath a dou∣ble relation. either to God, and then it is a quiet and si∣lent subiection of our hearts to the will of God reuealed, though therein our wils be crossed, a meeke submission of our wils to Gods will reuealed, though neuer so contrarie vnto them, and to this Dauid exhorts, Ps. 4.4. examine your owne heart vpon your bed,What meek∣nesse is heere vnderstood. and bee still; and of this spoke the Prophet,, Esay 30.15. In quietnesse & in confidence shall be your strength, as if he had said, your strength must be exercised, not in striuing against, but in the enduring of Gods hand or it hath relation to men, and then it is a quiet & calme disposition of hart, as is neither prone to prouoke,  nor easily prouoked to anger, by anie iniurie, & this is the meeknes we are to vnderstand in this place, & not the other. Here then is required of vs, euen of as many as hold our selues, to be the Elect of God, that we put on calme & quiet spirits, that wee carry in vs such a disposition, as is neither prone to prouoke, nor soone prouoked to anger by any in∣iury,We are to put on calme and quiet spirits and wee must be so disposed as that wee neither be prone to pro∣uoke, nor soone prouo∣ked to anger by any iniury. and that is meeknes. We read 1. Pet. 3.4. that a meeke and quiet spirit are ioyned together, as indeed being one & the same thing, and we shall finde this dutie often vrged in Scripture, I referre you to the reading of Ephes. 4.2. Gal. 5.23. it is reckoned there among the fruites of the
spirit, and 2. Tim. 2.25. the Apostle teacheth Tymothy to instruct with meeknesse, them, that are contrarie minded, a worthy example of this wee haue in Moses, Numb. 12.3. who being much wronged by Aaron and Miriam, yet was meeke, and not stirred vp to anger; yea, he is there pro∣nounced, by the mouth of the Lord to bee a very meeke man, aboue all the men that were vpon the earth. Other examples and testimonies might be added, but these are su∣fficient to cleare it that this is our dutie, namely, that wee carrie in our bosomes, meeke and quiet spirits, and such a disposition of heart, as is neither prone to prouoke, nor soone stirred vp to anger.  Reproofe of such as are of hot, hastly spi∣rits, soone stirred vp to anger. Heere then come such to be taxed, and iustly to bee re∣prooued, that are of hot, hastie, and turbulent spirits, soon stirred vp to anger on euery trifling occasion. Now too many such vntaught and vntamed hearts be amongst vs. Are there not many that shew themselues of vnquiet and turbulent spirits, on the least occasion that may be? Yea, are there not some that if they haue but a conceit of a wrong offered, or done to them, if they but imagine such a thing, are so farre carried in their passion, and perturbation, that they shew themselues boistrous, and threaten to doe great matters? Happily thou wilt say, why? Doe not wrong me,  nor a∣ny way disgrace me, and I am as quiet as any in the world, you may liue quietly enough by me I warrant you, as long as you liue, but if you doe me iniurie, if you crosse me of my will, then you must beare with me, I am somewhat pas∣sionate, and I cannont endure that. Is it so, that thou canst not endure to bee wronged,  nor to haue thy will a little crossed? Where is then that Chri∣stian meekenesse that ought to bee in thee? Surely, of thine owne mouth may we iudge of thee, thou at as meeke as a Beare, or a Lyon, or as the Deuill himselfe, hee is quiet when hee hath his will, but if that bee cros∣sed, then hee rageth; and so is it with thee, as wee
we may gather by thine owne confession. Oh deceiue not thy selfe, true Christian meekenesse that ought to bee in euery childe of God, is a quietnesse and calmenesse of Spirit, when iniuries and wrongs are offered or done to him, and that is the thing thou must labour for, thou must put on such a disposition of heart, as is neither prone to prouoke, nor soone prouoked to anger by iniuries and wronges, and that being once obtained thou art of a meek and quiet spirit. 4. motiues stirring vs vp to meekenesseNow then, to stirre vs vp to the putting on of this excel∣lent vertue, consider we, First, the excellency of it, it is a vertue of great ac∣count, and a thing much set by in the sight of God. 1. Pet. 3.4. Secondly, it is a testimony that we are taught of Christ and haue his Spirit in vs, Matth. 11.29. Learne of mee (saith our Sauiour Christ) that I am meeke and lowly in heart, and yee shall finde rest vnto your soules. Thirdly, consider (amongst others) that one excellent  effect of this vertue recorded, Prouerb. 15.1. that it is of force, being expressed by soft and meeke words, not only to keepe wrath from breaking out, but also to cause wrath, yea firie wrath, being broken out, to returne and goe back againe. A worthy example heereof wee haue in Gedeon, Iudg. 8.2. who with a milde and meeke answer appeased the hot and sharpe words of the proud Ephramites a∣gainst him, so as they had not a word to reply, the text saith, vers. 3. Their spirits abated towards him. Consider further, that comfortable promise that is  made to such as are meeke, Matth. 5.5. That they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the meeke, for they shall in∣herite the earth: they shall haue possession of outward good things, so farre forth as it may stand with Gods glo∣rie, and their good. Yea so farre forth also, they shall bee hid in the day of the Lords wrath. Zephan. 2.3. They shall bee protected from danger, when the Lord doth execute
his iudgements in the world. If then we could be cloathed with such a garment, as is much set by in Gods sight, if wee would testifie it to our selues, and others, that wee haue receiued the Spirit of Christ, (and he that hath not his Spirit is none of his) if we would preuaile against that, which in force is able to withstand, euen the wrath and rage of sinfull man, and if we would haue assurance that we haue right and title to the comfortable promise of God, touching the fruition of the good things of this life, and protection from euill in the day of the Lords wrath, so farre as may bee for his glorie and our good: and in one word, if wee would bee truely glorious in this world, and haue assurance of euer∣lasting glory in the life to come. Then let vs learne of the King of glory, Christ Iesus, to be meeke and milde in spirit, and let vs put on such a disposition of heart, as is nei∣ther prone to prouoke, nor soone prouoked to anger. Come we to the last vertue heere vrged by the Apostle, (Long suffering.) Concerning this vertue, know we, that long sufferingWhat long suffering is. differs not from meekenesse in kind, but onely in degree, for it is nothing else but a further degree of meekenesse, and that we mistake it not; we must vnderstand, that this vertue also hath a double relation,It hath a dou∣ble relation. there is a long suffering in respect of God, and that is a continued quiet submissi∣on of our wils to Gods will, vnder a long continued affli∣ction, when the hand of God is long continued vpon vs, and we continue to subiect ourselues to it in pacience and silence, that is long suffering in respect of God, and that is cald long patience, Iames 5.7. And of that the Apostle speakes Cap 1.11. Strengthened with all might through his glorious power, vnto all patience, and long suffering, with ioyfulnesse. There is also a long suffering in respect of men, and that is the longsuffering heere meant. And it is a continued calmenesse and quietnes of minde
after many iniuries and wrongs offered,What long suffering is heere meant. or done by men, when a man being much, and often prouoked by iniuri∣ous words, or deeds, doth notwithstanding quietly passe them ouer, and put them vp, and is still quiet and calme, not prouoked to anger, then is he long suffering. Heere then we see, that we are to put on a further de∣gree of meekenesse, we are to be of meeke and quiet spirits though wee bee prouoked to anger, after many offences and iniuries offered, and done to vs,We are to bee of meeke and quiet spirits though we be often prouo∣ked to anger, and after ma∣ny inuries of∣fered & done vnto vs. it is our parts to bee of meeke minde, and not to be stirred vp to anger, I will not stand long to prooue this, being (as wee said) but a further degree of meekenesse, read onely, Gal. 5 22. this vertue is there reckoned vp among the fruits of the spirit, whereby we are knowne to be the children of God, 1 Cor. 13.4. It is reckoned as one, yea as the first of those excel∣lent properties of loue, that loue is long suffering, and in many other places that might be cited, we finde this ver∣tue commended to vs, and indeede, it is a vertue rare, and scarse to be found in this age of the world. Where is that man that doth quietly, and in silence passe by many iniuries and wrongs? Nay, we are so farre from long suffering,Reproofe of them that are far from long suffering. that we will now suffer nothing at all. Yea, some sticke not to say, they will carrie no coales: and others hold it a disgrace to them, to pocket, and put vp an iniurie, and say, shall I suffer my selfe to be made a foole, and so indeed to auoid the name of fooles they will doe the workes of fooles; for anger resteth in the bosome of fooles Eccles. 7.11. and many other reasonings of the flesh there bee against this worthy grace of long suffe∣ring. 2. motiues to stirre vs vp to long sufferingNow in a word to stirre vs vp to the putting on of this excellent vertue, consider we, First, that long suffering is one of the properties of God himselfe, he is slow to anger, and aboundant in good∣nesse and truth, Psa. 103.8. the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, slow to anger, and of great kindnesse.
Againe, consider the excellency of this vertue, many  waies set foorth vnto vs in the booke of God. As Pro∣uerbs 14.29. He that is slow to wrath is of great wisdome, and Prou. 15.18. It appeaseth strife. Prouerbs 16.32. He that is slow vnto anger, is better then the mighty man, and hee that ruleth his owne minde, is better then hee that winneth a Citie; no Conquerour so mightie as hee that subdues his owne passions. Prou. 19.11. The dis∣cretion of a man deferreth his anger, and his glory is to passe by an offence. Howsoeuer then the world esteemes long suffering a note of folly, and want of wisdome, yet let vs rest in the testimony of the holy Ghost, that it is true discretion and wisdome to put vp iniuries and to passe by offences. Let vs endeauour to adorne our selues with this good∣lie ornament of long suffering, which indeed declares true wisdome, is a note of true valour and strength: and (which is chiefely to bee remembred of vs) it makes vs like to God himselfe, and so brings comfort to our owne soules. Let vs thinke on these things, and bee heereby stirred vppe to the putting on of this excellent vertue. Now heere a scruple is to be remoued, in that the Apo∣stle saith, Put on long suffering, and he speakes indefinitely, not limiting his speech (as you see) to a long suffering of some kind of iniuries. Heereupon a doubt may rise. Some may say, why?A doubt. Some kinde of iniuries are such, as if wee suffer them but a little time, wee hazard the losse of our liues, and the vtter ouerthrow of our state, and therefore we doubt whe∣ther we are to be long suffering in respect of them, or no. For remouall of this doubt,  we must learne a difference of offences and wrongs. Some are light offences,Difference of offences and wrongs. such words and deeds as onely offend vs without any losse or hurt to vs, and these wee are to treade vnder our feete, and to passe by as though
they were neuer spoke nor done, and of those is that place to bee vnderstood, Prou. 19.11. It is a mans honour to passe by an offence. The second sort of offences there be that are more then offensiue (namely) such as bring some small hurt to our goods, life, or good names, and these we may take notice of by the example of Christ, Iohn 8.40. but withall wee must doe as he there did, put them vp, and belong suffe∣ring in respect of them. A third sort of iniuries there be that goe yet further, (namely) such as bring danger to our liues or estates, ei∣ther in our goods or bodies, and these wee may take no∣tice of, and we may seeke a lawfull remedy against them, sooner or latter, according to the knowne danger of them, yet so, as in our seeking a lawfull remedy against them, wee still carrie in vs meeke and quiet spirits, for euen in seeking a remedie against great iniuries, such as endanger our liues or states, we are to be long suffering (that is) of quiet spirits; we must take heed that we nourish not in vs a lust of reuenge, when wee seeke the righting of some great wrong, by lawfull and appointed meanes. The A∣postle hath taught vs, Rom. 12.19. that wee must not a∣uenge our selues, vengeance is the Lords right, and wee may not incroach on it, either by thought, word, or deed. VER. 13. Forbearing one another, and forgiuing one an∣other, if any haue a quarrell to another: euen as Christ forgaue you, euen so doe yee. In this Verse our Apostle comes to shew wherein the two last named vertues, (namely) meekenesse, and long∣suffering, are to be declared, & he sets down distinctly two things wherein they are to be expressed and manifested.
First, in forbearing one another. and Secondly, in forgiuing one another. And the second of these he doth further amplifie. First, by the matter of forgiuenesse, what wee ought to  forgiue one another, and that is matter of quarrell, gene∣rally propounded, If any man haue a quarrell to ano∣ther. Secondly, by an argument, enforcing such forgiue∣nesse,  taken from the example of Christ, wherein is also ex∣pressed the manner of forgiuenesse, that it ought to bee as Christ forgaue vs, Euen at Christ forgaue you, euen so doe yee. These be the heads and generall things contained in this verse▪ come wee to speake of them as they lie in order, and first, of Forbearing one another. Touching this we must know,Interpreta∣tion. that to forbeare is (accor∣ding to the nature of the word here vsed) with patience to suffer and tollerate such things in our brethren, as are trou∣blesome and greeuous vnto vs; for the proper obiect of tolerance or forbearance, is the vnpleasing disposition or behauiour of our brethren, their disposition and manners that are offensiue and greeuous to vs. And so the mea∣ning of the Apostle, when hee saith, Forbearing one ano∣ther, is, as if he had said, tollerating, or suffering with pa∣such things in one another as are offensiue to you, sup∣porting one another in loue, for so the word is rendred, Ephes. 4.2. Supporting or bearing one with another in such things as are found in your brethren troublesome, and greeuous vnto you. Heere then we may easily see,What forbea∣ring on ano∣ther is. what is the duty laid be∣fore vs, (namely) this, that wee are to manifest and ex∣presse our meekenesse and long suffering in a patient suf∣ferance, and tolleration of such things in our brethren as are troublesome and grieuous vnto vs, in a quiet bearing with their vnpleasing disposition, and manners; and that we be not deceiued in this duty, know wee more particu∣larly,
that our meekenesse ought to be expressed in tolle∣rating and bearing the infirmities and frailties of our bre∣thren, appearing in their outward actions, as their hasti∣nesse, slownesse, rashnesse, frowardnesse, or their passions and perturbations, appearing likewise in their actions on∣lie, so farreforth as they are displeasing vnto vs, or doe therein wrong vs. What things we are not to tolerate in o∣thers.We are not indeed to tollerate and suffer the open of∣fences and sinnes of men, but we are to admonish and re∣proue them for the same, keeping our selues within the compasse of our callings, yea if so be Gods glorie bee cald in question, or the saluation of men be like to be hindred, we are then for a time to lay aside meekenesse, and to put on seuerity. We read that Moses the meekest man on the earth, when hee saw the people of God worshiping the golden calfe, was so incensed with anger, that hee brake the two Tables in peeces beneath the mountaine, Exod. 32.19. hee tooke his sword, and together with the sonnes of Leui slew three thousand of the people the same day, as wee finde verse 28. Yea, Christ himselfe though hee would not breake a brused reede, yet when hee had to deale with the great corruption of the Scribes and Pha∣risies,  he denounced woe vpon woe, Mat. 23.13. So then the dutie is thus to be conceiued. Wee are to manifest our meekenesse, and our quiet suffering and bearing, with the infirmities of our brethren, as their hastinesse, slownesse, or other passions and per∣turbations, appearing in their actions, so farre foorth, as they are displeasing to vs:We are to ma∣nifest our meekenesse in our quiet bea∣ring with the infirmities of our brethren, and with their passions and perturbatiōs, so farre foorth as they are displeasing to vs. and this is it that wee are ex∣horted to, Ephes. 4.2. That wee support and beare vp one another in loue, in regard of infirmities. And Gal. 6.2. saith the Apostle, beare one anothers burden, meaning such things in our brethren as are like burdens, euen trou∣blesome and greeuous vnto vs. Now before wee come to presse this dutie, wee may heereby easily see, that such persons are farre from Chri∣stian
meekenesse, who will not forbeare their brethren in the least thing that may be.Such as will not forbeare their bre∣thren in the least thing, are farre from Christian meekenesse. Yea, some there bee, whose mouthes (publishing their owne shame) sticke not to say, I cannot forbeare, I must needs speake my minde, yea, some are growen so shameles as to say, I will not forbeare him, say what you can, and he shall haue as good as he brings, I can be as hot and as hasty as he for his life. Surely, they that thus speake, are farre from Christian meekenesse and long suffering, and as yet can haue no as∣surance that they are in the number of the Elect of God, and that they are beloued of God in Christ. Now then to stirre vs vp to the practise of the duty laid before vs.Motiues to stirre vs vp to this duty of forbearance, are three. Consider wee first the necessity of this duety of forbea∣rance, how needefull a thing it is, to beare with the infir∣mities of our brethren, and with their displeasing passions,  so farrefoorth as they are displeasing to vs; it is so necessa∣rie, and of so great vse and consequence, as without it wee cannot lead a quiet and comfortable life, in anie society, if one be as hot, as hasty, or as froward as another, there can bee no comfortable fellowshippe in anie societie, neither indeede where that is. can any society bee firme and du∣rable. And againe: Consider the benefit that comes by bearing with the  frailties of our brethren. We thereby many times turne a∣away much hurt from our selues and others, for as Salomon saith, Prou. 18.16. a fooles lippes come with strife, it is not so much the occasion giuen, as lippes that make strife, it is not so much the hastinesse of the one, as the hot reply of ano∣ther, that worketh a quarrellous contention, which by for∣bearance may bee auoyded, yea, wee bearing with our bre∣thren, sometimes for the present, may afterward (the pas∣sion once ouerpast) haue any reasonable contentment at their hands, yea sometimes by forbearing thy brother for
a time, thou maist shortly after haue him voluntari∣lie, and of his owne accord acknowledge his faults to thee. And consider further that the poore oft-times forbeare the rich, the subiects the magistrate, the base the No∣ble, eyther for feare of hurt or hope of some good, and ought not wee much more for conscience sake frame our selues to forbeare our brethren. For conclusion then of this point, if wee desire to liue a quiet and comfortable life in any society, if wee would turne away much hurt from our selues and others: if wee would shew that good conscience is as powerfull in vs, as the feare of hurt, or the hope of good is in others, to make vs doe that wee ought, then let vs in the feare of God bee stirred vp to manifest our meekenesse and long suffering in tollerating and bearing with the infirmities of our brethren, and their passions appearing in their actions so far forth as they are displeasing to vs. Before wee come to the second thing heere menti∣oned, obserue that the Apostle makes Christian for∣bearance a mutuall and reciprocall duety, hee saith, forbea∣ring one another mutually, or by course, giuing vs to vn∣derstand That euery one hath sometimes need to bee forborne,Euery one hath neede sometimes to bee forborne. euen the best haue need often times to bee supported and borne withall. For indeede the best haue not onely their infirmities in performance of holy dueties,  (and therefore wee finde that men of rare graces and great strength haue vsed the helpe of others to strengthen them as Moses vsed the helpe of Hur, a man farre inferiour to himselfe. Exo∣dus 17 12. But they haue in them such things as are troublesome, greeuous, and offensiue to their brethren, they are eyther too selfe-conceited, abounding in their owne sence, or som∣what hasty, or the like, and therefore haue need sometimes
to be borne withall, in which case a mutuall forbearing one of another is very necessary. Doest thou then see thy brother at this time too self-con∣ceited, a little hasty, or the like,  beare with that his infirmity now, and hee may happily beare with thee in the like case another time,Beare with the infirmity of thy bro∣ther now, and he may hap∣pily beare with thee in like case ano∣ther time. and beare thou with his dulnesse, and hee will beare with thy frowardnesse, beare thou with his hastinesse, and hee will beare with thy selfe-conceited∣nesse, &c. I passe on to the second thing, wherein meekenesse and long suffering, are to bee expressed (namely) in forgiuing one another. And concerning this first, know wee,Note. that forgiuenesse is more then forbearance, for a man may forbeare to re∣uenge an iniurie because hee wants power to doe it, or it is not expedient for him as yet, hee wanting opportunity or the like, and wee know God himselfe suffers the wicked reprobate, for a time to goe vnder his long sufferance, but hee forgiues them not their sinnes, so that forgiuenesse is more then forbearance, & that we may rightly conceiue it as it is here expressed, according to the proper signification of the word heere vsed by the Apostle,What it is to forgiue one another. know wee further that the forgiuing one another is a free remission, (for so the word signifies) a free remission of reuenge (that is) of requiting euill for euill, and of returning punishment in  way of requitall, for iniuries done to vs, either by thought,We are to ex∣presse our meeknesse, in remitting all reuenge for iniuries done vnto vs, in not requiting euill for euill, nor returning punishment in way of re∣quitall. word or deede, when wee neither carry in vs any hatred or purpose of reuenge for wrongs receiued, nor returne punishment in way of requitall for them, then wee for∣giue. Heere then we see the duty required of vs is this. That wee expresse and make knowen our meekenesse and long suffering, in remmitting all reuenge for iniuries done, in not requiting euill for euill, nor returning pu∣nishment for them in way of requitall, either by thought, worde or deede, for howsoeuer wee may (as before was
shewed) seeke and vse lawfull remedie against such iniuries as are dangerous to our liues, or estate, yet in the vse of it, we may not carry in vs a desire of reuenge, for that were to make the Magistrate an instrument of our malice, but wee must manifest our meekenesse and long suffering, in put∣ting away all hatred, and remitting all reuenge, either by thought word or deede, and that is true and right forgiue∣nesse one of another:True and right forgiue∣nesse one of another. And this duety the Lord doth often require at our hands, yea, our Sauiour Christ requires it should be done, if need be,Mat. 18.22. oftentimes, not seauen times, but seauenty times sea∣uenty times. And it is that, also we do make continuall profession of, and not only before men, but euen before the Lord him∣selfe forgiue vs our debts, as wee also forgiue our debters, we find this a cleere poynt,Mat. 6.12. Luk. 11.4. and often vrged in the Scrip∣ture. And the vse is the pressing of the practise of this duty,We are to practise this duty. & indeede the dutie of forgiuenesse is very needfull to bee vrged in this age, it is a thing wee are hardly drawen vnto, there bee many oppositions and reasonings of the flesh a¦gainst it,Carnall rea∣sonings a∣gainst it. as forsooth the matter is so greeuous and so foule, wee could forgiue any wrong, and our friends should en∣treat vs for any other thing but this: neuer remembring how great offences God forgiues vs, and if wee say, we haue deserued better at their hands,  that wrong vs, so doth God of vs, if we meant them no harme, no more doth God to vs, if we say, they are farre our inferiours, what are we (dust and ashes) compared to the Lord? if we say we haue often for∣giuen them with warning, to doe so no more, how much oftner hath the Lord forgiuen vs? A carnall di∣stinction.Some againe, being by order of friendes, or otherwise mooued to forgiue, happily they will forgiue the fault, but not forgette the matter, nor affect the person of∣fending them, but carry stil a purpose of reuenge,
therefore we haue need often and earnestly to be stirred vp to the practise of this duety, of forgiuing one another.Two mo∣tiues to stirre vs vp to for∣giue one another. And to that purpose, consider with mee these same two things. First, we haue heere layd before vs the example of Christ,  if we had onely the example of the holy Prophets or Apo∣stles and other holy seruants of God, ought wee not to bee moued by the example of so many worthy persons to for∣giue one another? how much more hauing the example of the sonne of God to draw vs to it. Againe, consider that forgiuenesse one of another is an vndoubted and infallible argument to perswade our con∣sciences,  that we likewise haue our sinnes remitted and for∣giuen, and without that wee not onely haue no such assu∣rance, but on the contrary haue iust cause to feare, that the Lord will pursue vs to the vtmost for our sinnes, according to that fearefull parable Matth. 18.24. to the end of the chapter. Now then lay these two things together. Consider, that Christ Iesus hee suffered and bare the in∣finite wrath of his father, euen all that was due to all, and e∣uery one of Gods chosen, it cost him the shedding of his dearest bloud to procure remission of our sinnes. Now we for our parts may forgiue one another, without either cost or paine, yea, we cannot doe it but with vnspea∣kable comfott, euen thereby assuring our owne hearts of the pardon and forgiuenesse of our owne sinnes; Oh then who is it that will not bee perswaded to such a duty, wher∣in Christ himselfe hath gone before him? it is a duety full of sweete comfort, thinke vppon it, and bee stirred vp (in the feare of God) by the example of Christ, and for thine owne comfort, to forgiue thy brother. put away all ha∣tred, and purpose of reuenge for iniuries receiued. goe not about to requite euill for euill, by thought, worde, or deed. Come we to the amplification of this duty, of forgiuing one
another, and first (as we sayd) it is further layd before vs, by the matter of forgiuenesse in these words (if any haue a quarrell to another) the matter of forgiuenesse, is matter of quarrell, the word (quarrell) is onely needefull heere to be explained, and touching that, know we that by (Quarrell) in this place, is meant any iust cause of complaint, when a man hath iust cause to complaine of some offence, of some iniurie or wrong offered or done to him by another, and so the meaning is briefely this, if any one haue iust cause to complaine of an iniury or wrong offered or done to him by another. Heere then obserue wee, that that the Apostle doeth limit forgiuenesse one of another to matter of quarrell, hee boundes our forgiuenesse one of another, vppon iust cause of complaint, on matter of offence, and of in∣iury, offered or done to vs by our brethren, this is to bee marked of vs, it giues some light for the vnderstanding of that, howe wee may bee sayd to remitte and forgiue the trespasses of our brethren,How we for∣giue the tres∣passes of our brethren. as wee are taught to pray, name∣ly, not as they are properly sinnes and transgressions of Gods Lawe, (for so the remission of them belongs onely to the Lord, and no man is able to doe it) but wee forgiue the trespasses of our brethren, as they giue to vs iust cause of complaint, as they are iniuries and wrongs, brin∣ging detriment and hurt to vs, either in bodie, goods, or good name, so men may remit without impeachment, or derogation from Gods glorie, a man doeth remitte the trespasses of his brethren, when hee doeth forgiue the iniury and harme rising from them to himselfe, toge∣ther with all the conceiued anger and malice for the same. Now in that the Apostle doth subioine to forgiuing one another, the matter of forgiuenesse in these termes (if anie man haue a quarrell to another) if anie man haue iust cause of complaint against another, we easily see thus much offered to our consideration.
That wee are to forgiue our brethen, euen  then when wee haue iust cause to complaine of them,We are then to forgiue our brethren, whē we haue iust cause of of∣fence and quarrell. in regard of some iniury or wrong offered, or done to vs by them, wee are then to forgiue, when we haue iust cause of offence and quarrell. We finde the question thus propounded by Peter, Mat. 18.21. Master howe often shall my brother sinne against mee, and I shall forgiue him, and Luk. 14.5. saith our Sa∣uiour, though thy brother sinne against thee, though thy brother offend thee, and thou haue iust cause of complaint against him seauen times in a day, and seauen times in a day turne againe to thee, saying, it repenteth me, thou shalt forgiue him, The reason and ground of this duty is very plain, name∣ly this. Then is the fit time for the exercise and shewing foorth of any practicall grace or vertue,  when there is matter offe∣red, and iust occasion giuen for the practise of it: for exam∣ple, when there is a triall of a mans patience, by some thing prouoking and stirring him vp to impatiency, then is the fit time for the exercise of his patience, when there is meanes and prouocation to ryot and excesse, then is the fit time for a man to shew himselfe sober and temperate, and so is it in this particular. Then is the fit time to shew foorth our meeknesse, in for∣giuing our brethren, when they offend and wrong vs, either in word or deed. Therefore wee are to forgiue one another,  euen then when wee haue iust cause to complaine on of another,Reproofe of such as regard not this duty, but plead against it. this duty is little regarded in the world; may wee not often heare it out of the mouthes of some, yea, they hold it a good plea, and sufficient defence for themselues (say they) may wee not serue him as he hath serued vs, and deale with him as he hath dealt with vs? and being reprooued for their
violence in speech and behauiour, expressing their canke∣red and reuengefull mindes, why (say they) iudge you of it, they dare appeale to the iudgement of him that re∣prooues them, haue wee not iust cause? haue wee not rea∣son for it, thus to bee mooued, and thus to speake, and thus to deale? wee woulde gladly bee quiet, but wee haue iust cause giuen vs to be thus vnquiet. See howe contrarie our corrupt reasoning of the flesh is, to the wisedome of the holy Ghost. Admit this, thou hast iust cause to be offended, to com∣plaine of thy brother, in regard of some iniurie done to thee, yet behold and consider how the holy Ghost hath cut off that which thy crooked and corrupt reason is readie thereuppon to inferre, that because thou hast iust cause, therefore thou mayest shew thy selfe violent and reuenge∣full; and carrie in thee a distempered minde, no, no, saith the holy Ghost, if thou haue a quarrell to thy brother, thou art to forgiue him, and then is the fit time to forgiue thy brother, when thou hast iust cause of offence giuen thee from him, thinke on it whosoeuer thou art, that art ready to followe the crooked rule of thine own reason, and remember that though thine owne wisedome tell thee that thou hauing iust cause of offence, thou mayest shewe thy selfe violent and reuengefull, yet the worde of God, by which one day thou shalt bee iudged, hath taught thee otherwise. And againe: Note.If thou alwaies deale with thy brother, as thou hast iust cause, surely, thou mayest looke the Lord will not remit any thing of the rigour of his iustice towards thee, and then thy case is most miserable, thou art then but a childe of perdition. Remember it, and bee stirred vppe euen then to for∣giue thy brother, when thou hast iust cause to com∣plaine of him, for some iniurie by him offered vnto thee.
Come wee now to the argument enforcing this dutie of forgiuing one another from the example of Christ in these wordes (Euen as Christ forgaue you, euen so doe yee. These wordes for the meaning of them neede not long to bee stood on,Interpreta∣tion. onely wee are to examine how Christ forgiueth vs; and touching that, know wee that Christ may be considered two waies. Either as a Medi∣diator God and man in one person, and so hee satisfi∣ed for our sinnes, and procured remission of the sinnes of all Gods chosen, and hee it is by whom, and tho∣row whom, or for whose sake, as the Apostle speakes, Ephesians 4.12. They haue forgiuenesse of sinnes. Or as God the Sonne, the second person in the Trinitie, of the same essence with the Father, and so doth hee pro∣perly forgiue sinnes, according to that assertion of the Pharisies, not denied by Christ, Marke 2.7. None can forgiue sinnes but God onely. So the meaning of the Apostle in saying, as Christ forgaue you, is, as if hee had said, as God in Christ for gaue you, which agrees with that, 2 Corinthians 5.19. God was in Christ and reconciled the world to him selfe, not imputing their sins vnto them. Now first, heere wee see the argument laide before vs, is from the example of Christ, that wee are to forgiue one another, as Christ hath forgiuen vs. I might hence take occasion to speake of our imitation of Christ in generall, but that is not so proper to this place: onely know wee thus much. That the actions of Christ are of three sorts.Christ his a∣ctions are of 3. sorts. First, such as are proper to his Godhead, as  to worke myracles, to forgiue sinnes, and the like, and these are to bee acknowledged of vs, to con∣firme our faith touching his Godhead, but not to be imi∣tated.In two sorts of actions we are not to i∣mitate Christ.
The second sort of the actions of Christ, are his works of mediation, as to satisfie for sinne, to make intercession for vs, and the like, and these likewise we are to acknow∣ledge, and beleeue to our comfort, but not to take vpon vs to imitate. A third sort of his actions be those, which Christ did as man vnder the Law, euen workes commanded in the Law of God, and in these indeed, we are to imitate Christ,Wherein wee are to imitate Christ. in obedience to the morall Law onely, are wee to follow Christ, and to treade in his steps. And therefore it is but a a fancie and dreame of the Papists, that we are to imitate ChristA Popist. fan∣cie touching imitation of Christ. in his 40. daies fast, it is but a vanishing speculation of their owne braines. I leaue them, and come to speake of that which is more proper to these words, and for concluding of the point; we are to consider these wordes, Euen as Christ forgaue you, euenso doe yee, together with that, Ephes. 4.32. For∣giuing one another, euen as God for Christs sake forgaue you: or this text as before we expounded it, As God in Christ for∣gaue you. Hence we may easily gather, That remission of sinnes once granted, remaines for∣euer,Remission of sinnes once granted, re∣maines for euer. it is vnchangeable. For why? God forgiues sinnes, and he forgiues in, and through Christ, euen for Christ his sake, remission of sins comes from Gods free grace and loue, and it comes in, and through the sonne of his loue, Cap. 1.13. and his loue in Christ neuer changeth, and therefore remission of sinnes is most certaine and vnchangeable. And this is a ground of sweet and excellent comfort to all such as haue the assurance of the pardon of their sinnes.Comfort to such as are as∣sured of the pardon of their sinnes. Hast thou any assurance of the pardon of thy sinnes? remember it then to thy comfort, that remission of sinnes comes from God, and it comes to thee thorow Christ, in whom he is well pleased, and that for euer; and there∣fore
the remission of thy sinnes remaines for euer. Yea, may some say, remission of sinnes once granted,  remaines for euer, and the assurance of it is full of sweete comfort, but we cannot come to the knowledge and assu∣rance of the remission of our sinnes. Indeed, the Papists doe so teach, and it is a reasoning of the flesh, often rising in the mindes of some. But for answer to it,  I will goe no further then this very text, if we cannot come and be assured that our sinnes are forgiuen, then the Apostles argument is not good, heere vrging vs to forgiuenesse one of another. For marke it, he perswades to forgiue one another as Christ hath forgiuen vs. Now how shall I forgiue my brother, as God in Chirst hath forgiuen me, if I cannot be sure of his mercy in the forgiuenesse of mine own sinnes? He that doubts, whe∣ther God in Christ hath forgiuen him, or no, how shall he apply himselfe therein to bee like to Christ? And how shall he finde and feele himselfe bound to forgiue his bre∣thren, as Christ hath forgiuen him? And therefore with∣out question, the example of Christ set before vs for imi∣tation, doth plainely teach that wee may be assured of it; that God in Christ hath forgiuen vs our sinnes, and ha∣uing such assureance we are to remember to our comfort, that forgiuenesse of sinnes once granted, it remaines for e∣uer, because Gods loue in Christ to his chosen neuer chan∣geth. Meditate heereupon to thy comfort, thou that hast any assurance of the pardon of thy sinnes. Marke further, that the Apostle doth not onely vrge vs to forgiue one another by the example of Christ, but hee doth also presse vpon vs to forgiue, as Christ hath forgiuen vs, (Euen as Christ forgaue you, euen so doe yee.) Which word (as) doth not import Equali tie, but Similitude. We are to forgiue one another as God in Christ hath forgiuen vs. I might heere runne into a large field, but I will onely point at some things briefe∣lie.
Hence we are taught. That our forgiuenesse one of another must bee free,We must free∣lie forgiue one another. we are not to forgiue vpon condition or consideration vp∣on the suite of friends, vpon the importunitie of the party or the like, but freely and without any by-respect, as God hath forgiuen vs, yea we are to be like to God, especially in this, in forgiuing the whole offence and iniurie. That which God forgiue, hee forgiues wholly and ne∣uer after imputes it, so are we to forgiue our brethren, not carrying a peece of an iniurie vnforgiuen, not reseruing in our mindes part of a wrong till afterward, If we so doe our case is most fearefull, and when we vse that petition,The fearefull state of such as doe not wholly for∣giue their bre∣thren disco∣uered. Forgiue vs our debts, as we also forgiue our deb∣tors, we most fearefully pray against our selues; dost thou open thy mouth, and call to the Lord to forgiue thee, as thou forgiuest thy brother, and dost thou reserue a peece of thy malice against thy brother? Surely thou dost be∣seech the Lord to reserue a part of his wrath against thee, and that is a fearefull thing, that thine owne mouth should so call for vengeance to be powred downe vpon thy selfe, the least part of his wrath is able to crush thee, & to presse thee downe to the bottome of hell. Thinke on it, and as thou desirest that the Lord should wholly forgiue thee, so do thou fully and wholy forgiue thy brother: let not thine owne tongue bee so dreadfully vsed against thy selfe. VER 14. And aboue all things put on loue which is the bond of perfection. Our Apostle hauing exhorted to tender mercy, &c. Verse 12. and shewed verse 13. wherein meekenesse and long suffering are to be expressed: in this 14. & 15. verses following, hee goes on further to exhort the Colossians two other vertues by comparison (namely to Loue in this verse, and to peace the fruit of loue in the verse following.
Heere therefore hee exhorts them to put on loue, and that not simply, but by a comparison with the forenamed vertues, euen to put on loue, as a more excellent and pre∣cious vertue then any before named, or as the vppermost, and so the fairest, richest, and most precious peece of the new cloathing, And aboue all these things, saith the Apostle, put on loue. Then hee doth further amplifie his exhortation by a description of loue, setting it out by the excellent vse of it, that it serues as a bond, that it is the bond of perfection; That is the generall matter of this verse. Come wee to examine the words touching the true sense and meaning of them (Aboue all these things) that is, aboue all these forenamed vertues, Put on loue.Interpreta∣tion. The Apostle doth heere still continue his Metaphor, taken from the cloathing of the bodie, and hee com∣pares loue to the vppermost garment, that it is to bee put on with, and aboue all the rest of the cloathing, and his meaning is with all other vertues, put on loue, and that principally, as the vppermost garment, and chiefest part of that glorious vesture of the newe man, and by loue we are to vnderstand, loue to our brethren, loue of one another, (which is the bond of perfection) the word heere translated (bond) signifieth not such a bond as doth tie one thing to another, but properly such a bond as doth cowple, conioine, binde, and vnite ma∣ny things together, and is to be rendred (couple, or con∣iunction) bond of perfection, that is, according to the true and naturall signification of that word (of integri∣ty) or as I may say, of wholenesse: for it signifieth the wholenesse of any body, either naturall, morall, or ciuill, when any body is a compleat and whole body, consisting of all the parts of it, then it is a perfect body. Now the integrity or wholenesse heere spoken of, is to bee vnderstood with relation, both to the vertues bee∣fore
spoken of, and to all other Christian vertues and duties that passe from man to man, which altogether make as it were one perfect body, and with relation to the body of the Church, consisting of diuers members, that loue is the couple, coniunction, and knitting together of all Christian vertues and duties of man to man, and ma∣king them as it were one perfect body, and conioining al∣so the members of the Church one to another, and ma∣king them on whole and perfect body, cowpling toge∣ther the members of the whole Church, yea conioining the members of euery particular Church, yea of euery society in the Church, that is the meaning of the Apostle when he saith, Loue is the bond of perfection. Thus then we are to conceiue his meaning in the words of this verse, as if he had said. And with these, and all other vertues and du∣ties that passe from man to man, put on loue one to another, as the most excellent part of that glori∣ous vesture of the new man, which loue doth v∣nite and knit together all Christian vertues and duties that passe from man to man, making them as one perfect body, and cowpling together all the members of the whole Church, yea, the members of euery particular Church and socie∣tie, and so perfecting the whole Church, ma∣king it a perfect body, and perfecting euery par∣ticular Church, yea, euery societie in the Church. Now, first note with mee in a word, that the Apostle doth heere exhort to put on Loue as a part of the new man. Hence it is cleare. That true Christian loue of our brethren is not in vs by nature, there is no inclination in vs by nature to loue
our brethren a right, no certainely,True Christi∣an loue of our brethren is not in vs by nature. true loue of our bre∣thren is a renewed affection, whereby wee are mooued to wish, speake, and doe well vnto them. It is reckoned as one of the fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. and 1. Tim. 1.5. The Apostle saith, it comes out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith vn∣fained; and indeed the will and affections must bee chan∣ged before there be any place for true loue. And this meets with that error of the Papists, who teach  that the first act of loue is in vs by nature,It is a Popish error that the first act of loue is in vs by nature. and that wee haue in vs by nature an inclination to loue both God and men, and that onely the second act, or exercise of loue is from grace. This is but their conceit, it cannot stand with the euidence and truth of the word of God in this text, and in many other places. And againe this teacheth vs, That wee can neuer loue our brethren truly and aright as we ought till we be changed and renued by the Spirit of God.Wee can ne∣uer loue our brethren as we ought, till we be renew∣ed by the Spi∣rit of God. A naturall man may loue others, in respect of the ho∣nour, profit, or pleasure hee receiues from them, or the Lord by his speciall prouidence may dispose the heart of a naturall man to affect others, yea, to doe good to them as it is said, Daniel 1.9. God brought Daniel into fauour and tender loue with the chiefe of the Eunuches, and Nebuchadnetzar shewed him great fauour and highly ad∣uanced him, Dan. 2.48. But a naturall man can neuer truely and aright affect others, and loue them in the Lord,Note. and as they beare his image, that is onely the worke of the Spirit of God; and therfore if we would truly loue and af∣fect our brethren, wee must labour to be renewed. Obserue in the next place, that the Apostle exhorts to put on loue, not simply, but by comparison, with the vertues foregoing, as a more excellent grace, then any of those forenamed, he saith (Put on loue aboue all) put on loue chiefely and principally, aboue all these.
Where first we see, that loue stands in comparison with such graces and vertues as haue relation to men, and haue their vse in Christian life and conuersation amongst men, that in respect of such graces and vertues, loue is to bee put on aboue them all, as a more excellent grace. Hence we are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That the excellency and preferment of loue aboue other graces, is in respect of such graces as haue relation to men,Loue is more exellent then any of those graces that haue relation to men. and haue vse in Christian life and conuersation a∣mong men; loue is not more excellent, neither is it heere nor any where else in Scripture, simply preferred aboue all graces whatsoeuer, (for in Gods sight and acceptation, faith excels it, not in any dignity in it selfe, but in respect of the obiect of it) so I say, loue is not more excellent then any other grace whatsoeuer, but its the chiefe grace and vertue in Christian life and conuersation, and more excellent then any of those graces that haue relation to men. This I note, in a word, to teach vs how we are to vnder∣stand it, when we finde loue so highly commended in the ScriptureHow wee are to vnderstand the high com∣mendation of loue in the Scripture. (namely) not as the forme and life of faith, as the Papists teach falsely and erroniously, but as the most excellent grace among those that haue relation to men, and haue vse in Christian life and conuersation. Obiect: Its preferred before faith, as a more excellent grace. 1 Cor. 13.13. Ans: Loue is there preferd before faith, not as a more excellent grace in it selfe, but in the vse of it, and that only in respect of men. Because it makes good workes done to men profitable to them, and referred to a right end in regard of men. And that is the meaning of the apostle. In that the Apostle doth exhort, to put on loue aboue all these, and other graces that haue relation to men, wee may easily see thus much laid before vs. That loue one of another is a most precious fruit of faith,
for faith worketh by loue, Gal. 5.6. and loue is the most ex∣cellent grace that comes from faith.Loue of our brethren is a most precious fruit of faith. And hence is it that the Apostle Peter 1. Pet. 4.8. agrees with our Apostle, and doth second him in his exhortation, and saith, aboue all things haue feruent loue among you, hee preferres loue before all other graces, and that iustly, for indeed without loue, what duties soeuer wee performe to our brethren are nothing worth as the Apostle shewes plainely and at large, 1. Cor. 13. and the Lord himself doth so account of loue to our brethren, that if a man were ready to come to his immediate worship, he is content that duty to him should rather be left vndone, then that the duty of loue (should be neglected to our brethren) as our Sauiour teacheth plainely, Mat. 5.23.24 if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thine offering before the altar, and go thy way, first bee reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. I might be large in setting forth the excellency of that worthy grace of loue one to a∣nother, but I chuse rather to seale the consideration of the excellency of it vppon our hearts, and to make vse of it to our selues, in that loue to our brethren is so excellent a grace. Wee must learne to esteeme it,  and to prize it aboue all other vertues that haue relation to men,We must esteeme loue to our bre∣thrē as a most excellent fruit of faith, a∣boue all other vertues that haue relation to men. and to breath after it as the most excellent fruit of faith, we are fallen into that age of the world our Sauiour foretold, Mat. 24.12. where∣in the loue of many is growne cold, and no doubt this a∣mongst others is one speciall reason of it, men haue not that hie esteem of loue to their brethrē as they ought, they account it not as the most excellent ornament, and to bee put on aboue all other vertues that haue relation to men, most men doe esteeme the loue of their bretheren but as a base thing, yea an argument of an abiect and base minde to put on loue with the properties and fruites of it mentioned, 1. Corinthians vers. 13. as not to disdaine
and not to bee prouoked to anger, yea are there not some who make the least account of it of any thing to beare true loue to their brethren? Happily they haue many other good qualities, they are sober, wise, iudicious and able to giue good counsell, but as for true loue to their bretheren, they haue no dram of that, and they make no reckoning of it, yea they esteeme it nothing to carry in their hearts the contrarie, euen hatred, malice, heart-bur∣ning against their brethren; too many such there bee in the world, and therefore we haue need to be taught this lesson, and often to heare of it, that wee are to esteeme loue of our brethren as the most excellent vertue amongest those that haue relation to men. Motiues to stir vs vp high∣ly to esteeme of loue to our brethren.And to settle this in our harts, let vs often thinke on that before spoken, that without loue all other vertues and du∣ties performed to men are nothing worth. 2. And againe, consider that our Sauiour makes it the very character, badge, & cognisance by which we may be knowne to be his disciples, Iohn 13.35. by this shall al men know that ye are my disciples, if ye loue one another, by this you shall make it cleare to the world that you are my disciples, let these things be often thought on, that the con∣sideration of them may work it into our hearts, euen high∣ly to esteem of loue, to account it as indeed it is that grace, amongst those that haue relation to men, that doth most grace and commend vs, and so to follow after loue, 1. Cor. 14.1. and to labour to put on loue aboue all other graces whatsoeuer. Marke further that the Apostle exhorts to put on loue aboue all those vertues before named. Hence wee are taught; That loue must bee as the cloathing of euery one of the graces before spoken of, yea of euery grace, ver∣tue, and duety that passeth from man to man, euery grace, vertue and duety of man to man must come from loue, and must be apparelled in the habit of loue.Euery grace, vertue & duty that passeth from man to man must come frō loue and must bee clothed in the habit of loue.
For why? the vertues before named,  and the like may bee in the Heathen, and were no doubt in many heathen men, they may be pittifull, kinde, modest, full of mercy, and many excellent vertues, and duties may proceed from some other roote, beside loue, the Apostle hath made it cleere, 1. Cor. 13. a man may speake as with the tongue of men and Angels, and not a word out of loue, hee may doe such things as shall bee rewarded at the day of iudgement, and yet not of loue. The vse then of this poynt is this. We are to looke that all our vertues that haue reference to men, bee clothed in the habit of loue to our brethren.  Wee must looke that all our ver∣tues that haue relation to men, be clo∣thed in the habit of loue to our bre∣thren. Two mo∣tiues to that purpose. Art thou pittifull, kinde &c. look that thy pitty and kind∣nesse bee cladde in the garment of loue, put on that aboue them all, and whatsoeuer good duty, thou doest in thy ge∣nerall or particular calling, let it bee done in loue, and to helpe vs forward in this duty, consider wee onely these two things. First, the graces heere named. and the like may in the vse of them be profitable to others without loue, but neuer will they be comfortable to thine owne soule. Againe, consider that many good duties bring not that fruit to others that they might, being not done in loue, be∣cause they want the blessing of God on them; for example, a maniustly corrects his childe or seruant, not in loue, and for the good of the childe or seruant, but out of his distem∣pered humour, respecting the satisfying of his owne ire∣full and furious minde, or hauing an eye onely to his owne profite, or the like, that duty is not blessed, to the child or seruant, but they still remaine as carelesse and retchlesse as euer they were before, I might instance in many other par∣culars, but to shut vppe all in a word, doest thou desire that thy pitty, thy kindnesse, and thy humblenesse of minde, should bee comfortable to thy selfe, and that duties done by thee should bring foorth fruite and profite, then looke that they all come from loue, and bee cloathed in the ha∣bit
of loue, & to end with the words of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 16.14. Let all your things bee done in loue, that so they may bring comfort to our selues, and wee may finde the blessing of God on them. In the description of loue to our brethren, in these words (which is the bond of perfection) we see an excellent vse of loue to men layd before vs,True Christi∣an loue to men, is as a bond, knit∣ting together the members of the Church and all Chri∣stian graces, vertues and duties, that passe from man to man. that it serues as a bond, knitting to∣gether the members of the Church, yea, knitting together all Christian graces, vertues and duties, that passe from man to man, making them as it were one perfect bodie, loue is the bond of that neare coniunction of the members of the Church one to another, and it is the bond of fellow∣ship and communion that is betweene them, it makes one member partaker of the graces and gifts of another, and that which is wanting in one member, is supplied by the vse of that grace and gift that is found in another thorow loue, and so loue serues as a bond, knitting together the mem∣bers of the Church, and knitting together all graces and gifts found in them, as into one bodie, fot howsoeuer the gifts and graces found in the members of the Church,Note. are all for the good of one another, and euery member hath right and title to them, and may challenge an interest in them all, there is not a grace or gift in any one member of the Church, but another that wants it, hath right to it, in the vse of it, as the Apostle teacheth plainely, 1. Corinth. 3.21.22. All things are yours, whether it be Paul, or A∣pollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death: whether they be things present, or things to come, euen all are yours, as if he had sayd, what gift or grace soeuer is bestowed on Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, you may challenge it as your owne in the vse of it, howsoeuer I say this is true, that what∣soeuer gift or grace is in one member of the Church, ano∣ther member that wants it, hath right to it, in the vse of it. Yet without loue, the gifts and graces that bee in the members of the Church, are not vsed for the good one of
another, the Apostle sayth, 1. Cor. 8.1, knowledge without loue puffeth vp, and it is true of other gifts of the like kind, arts, wisedome, &c. that without loue they are not vsed for the good of others, but it is loue that edifieth, it is loue that makes them profitable, and rightly applied, for the buil∣ding vppe of the body of Christ, and so loue both knits together the members of the Church, and makes the gra∣ces and gifts that are in the seuerall members profita∣ble. Yea, loue doth so conioyne the graces and gifts of the seuerall members in the vse of them, as if they were all in one man, and so makes as it were of seuerall graces and gifts a perfect bodie, Act. 4.32. it is there said that the multitude of beleeuers, were of one hart, which no doubt was through loue, they were so neerely conioyned by loue one to ano∣ther, as if there had beene but one heart and one soule in them all. And so without question, the gifts and graces that were in them seuerally, were by loue so knit together in the vse of them, as if they had beene all in one heart, and in one soule, and so by loue made as it were one perfect body: which is an excellent vse of true Christian loue to men. To draw this to some profitable vse. First know wee that there is an imputation commonly  cast on our Church by the Papists,A popish im∣putation commonly cast vpon our Church re∣mooued. that wee strippe true loue to our brethren, & the duties of loue, of all good vse in the Church of God, yea, that wee hold them vnprofitable and vnnecessary for Christians. And why so? Forsooth, because wee ascribe not to them the merit of our iustification in Gods sight, see the wilfull blindnesse of such as are deuoted to their owne pleasing conceit, they doate so much on the merit of loue and good workes, as they cannot (or at least will not) see anie other vse of them, but that which must needes shoulder out Gods grace and the merits of Christ, wee willingly acknow∣ledge
that profitable and necessarie vse of loue of others heere specified by the Apostle, that it serues as a bond of integritie or perfectnesse, euen to knit together the mem∣bers of the Church, and to make the gifts and graces that are in the members of the Church, as one perfect body, and in their vse as profitable as if they were all in one heart, and in one soule. How highly we esteeme of Christian loue and the duties of it.Yea, we esteeme of Christian loue, and the duties of it, as the beaten high way to eternall life, as testimonies of o∣bedience and thankefulnesse to God for his mercy, as illu∣strations of Gods glory, as meanes of much good to our brethren, as proper markes of true Christian profession, as necessary antecedents of the promised reward of eternall glory, as infallible euidences and proofes, of remission of sinnes, and fruits euer following a liuely, sound, and sa∣uing faith. Who then sees not, that most excellent and precious is the vse of loue, with as many amongst vs, as know and embrace the truth, and truely sauour the things of the spi∣rit of God, and therefore it is but a cauilling slander of our aduersaries, to say we depriue loue, and the fruits of it, of all good vse in the Church of God, and make no reckoning of them. For the vse of this poynt to our selues, is it so, that loue to our brethren is as a bond, knitting together the members  of the Church, and making the gifts and graces that are in them,It is for want of loue that men are di∣stracted and drawne asun∣der one from another. as one perfect body? It is then a plaine euidence, that it is for want of loue, when men are distracted, and some are carried one way, and some another, yea, it is want of loue, which makes vs amongst our selues so loose and so vncoupled one to an∣ther, that wee are as a body out of ioynt in many things, it is the want of loue, that makes vs start asunder one from another on euery trifling occasion. Wee are to acknowledge that, our want, and to bewaile it, and to stirre vs vppe to entertaine true loue, one to an∣other,
and where it is to encrease it. Consider I beseech you, this excellent vse of it,The excellent vse of loue to our brethren is to bee con∣sidered. that it serue to ioyne vs together as one man, true loue will make vs speak and think one thing, yea, it will make vs help one another, care one for another, comfort, councell, and encourage one another in good things, and to vse all the good gifts bestowed on vs, for the common good one of a∣nother, as if they were all in one man. And let vs know that any society without loue,Note. is but as a tottering wall of stones, cobbled vppe together, without morter or binding, and so easily shaken, and soone ruinate and throwen downe. And againe, remember that true loue to our brethren, is not onely taught by precept, but it is inwardly implanted in the hearts of all true beleeuers by the Spirit, as the Apostle saith, 1. Thess. 4.9. touching brotherly loue, yee neede not that I should write vnto you, as if hee had sayd, as naturall brethren (not degenerating and growing out of kinde) are taught by nature to loue one another, so you, to whom God harh giuen his spirit, are taught of God to loue one another. Let vs then besides the excellent vse of loue one to an∣ther, remember this, that as many as are true beleeuers haue learned of the spirit of God to loue one another, and if wee haue not learned this lesson, surely wee are not yet taught of the spirit of God, wee haue not yet receiued the spirit, and hauing not receiued his Spirit, wee are none of his. Obserue with me in the next place, that the Apostle cals loue (the bond of perfection) hee saith not put on loue, which is perfect, but which is the bond of perfection, hence wee  may easily see.True Christi∣an loue is not perfect in it selfe, but it is the bond of perfection. That loue that is in true beleeuers, and ought to be put on by them, is not perfect in it selfe, but the bond of it, true Christian loue in the members of Christ is not a perfection of loue
but it is the bond of perfection in the sence before shewed. This I note in a word, against the lying Sect of the fami∣ly of loue,Confutation of the con∣ceit of the Familists. (indeed the grosse abusers of loue) who beare themselues much on this text of the Apostle, and conclude that because the Apostle saith heere, loue is the bond of perfection, therefore there is a perfection of loue in the re∣generate in the time of this life. A meere deuice of their owne braine, this text will not warrant such a conclusion, it is farre from the meaning of the holy Ghost. Oh but say they, will you denie a perfection of loue, and holinesse in the regenerate in the time of this life. Why, the Scripture is pregnant and plaine for it, do we not read, 1. Ioh. 4.17. heerein is that loue perfect in vs, that we should haue boldnesse in the day of iudgement. And againe verse 18. there is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth out feare, for feare hath painfulnesse, and he that fea∣reth is not perfect in loue, Phil. 3.15. Let vs therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded. I answer them. First, it cannot be denied, but that there is a perfection of holinesse in the regenerate, in the time of this life, but both they and we must vnderstand what kind of perfection it is (namely) a perfection of parts, and not of degrees, or more plainely, there is in them that are truely regenerate, in the time of this life, measure of sanctity and holinesse in all the faculties of their soules, and in all the parts and mem∣bers of their bodies, yea, there bee in them the beginnings of all vertues, and the seeds of all graces, by which they en∣deauour to obey God in all his commandements, and so there is in them such an holinesse, as hath in it all the parts of perfect holinesse,Note. such as is seated in euery power of their soules, and in euerie part of their bodies, and that is a perfection of parts, but they haue not in them a
perfect measure and degree of any part of holinesse, nor an holinesse in any power of the soule, or part of the bo∣die, perfect in the measure of it, and so no perfection in degrees, for as the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 13.9. The most re∣generate know but in part, and therefore their loue, and other graces that are in them, are proportionable, they are but in part, not perfect in the time of this life. But for answer to that place, 1 Iohn 4.17. on which the  Familists beare themselues exceedingly. First, they can neuer euince and prooue it, that in that place by loue is meant that loue that is in vs, that loue wee beare either to God or man: but rather by loue is there meant Gods loue to vs that are true beleeuers, which is said to be perfect in vs, in regard of the effect of it, in re∣gard of the vse and comfort of it, shed abroad in our hearts, for Iohn saith, verse 16. Wee haue knowne, and beleeued the loue that God hath in vs, (or towards vs) and then he goes on still, (no doubt) speaking of the same loue, and saith, Heerein is that loue perfect in vs; but admit that Iohn there speakes of that loue that is in vs, either towards God or men, and hee calles it perfect loue, What then? Will it thereupon follow, that there is an absolute perfe∣ction of loue in the regenerate, in the time of this life, and such loue as hath no defect in it? No, no, their light braines deceiue them, if they so imagine. For by perfect loue vnderstanding it of that loue that is in vs, he meaneth such loue as is true, found, and vnfained, opposed to that which is hollow and hypocriticall, and thus wee finde the word (perfect) expounded Isai. 38.3. Where Hezekiah saith, Lord remember me now, how I haue walked bee∣fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, where we may easily see that by perfection of heart, hee vnderstandeth truth and sincerity of heart, and so in this place by per¦fect loue is meant sound, true, and vnfained loue, and such loue casteth out feare, euen all slauish feare. The Familists therefore cannot fasten it on this or any
other place of Scripture, that there is in the regenerate, in the time of this life, an absolute perfection of loue, wee are to renounce it as a phantasticall conceit of such as are deluded by the Spirit of error. There is yet another sect (I meane the Papists) who a∣buse this description of loue, and gather from it a false con∣clusion. They gather that because the Apostle saith, (Loue is the bond of perfection.) It is a false conclusion gathered frō hence by the Papists, that we are made perfect by loue, and iu∣stified by loue in Gods sight.That we are made perfect by loue, and iustified by loue in the sight of God. But this cannot stand with the true meaning of this de∣scription. Wee shewed beefore it is thus to bee concei∣ued. That loue serues as a bond to knit together all Christian vertues and duties that passe from man to man, as it were into one per∣fect body, its a bond of perfection in re∣spect of those vertues and duties that haue relation to men, and therefore it cannot bee rightly hence gathered, that loue is of vse to make perfect in the sight of God. That conclusion is built on a sandy foundation, and a misconstruction of the Text; but grant this vnto them which they are neuer able to prooue, that true beleeuers haue a perfect measure of loue, yet can it not iustifie them in the sight of God; for iustification in Gods sight stands, partly, in the remission of sinnes, and partly, in righteousnesse imputed, or as the Papists say, inherent righteousnesse. Now perfect loue in degree cannot procure remission of any one sinne, that is no part of Gods promise annexed to his couenant of workes, he saith not, doe this and thou shalt liue, and if thou doe it not, but breake my Law, by perfect loue thou shalt satisfie for that breach. No, no, the condition of perfect obedience in the morall Law pro∣pounded, once broken, there can be no compensation, or
satisfaction, but by punishment, either in the person of∣fending, or of some other in his steed; without question the actiue obedience of Christ was most exact and per∣fect, yet was not that perfect, legall, and meritorious obe∣dience of his sufficient to procure remission of sinnes, but hee must ouer and besides that, suffer death, euen the cur∣sed death of the Crosse, and beare in his body and soule, the extremitie of Gods wrath, beefore hee could satisfie Gods iustice for the sinnes of his chosen; and therefore it is said, hee bare our sinnes in his bodie on the tree, 1. Pet. 2.24. Wee may then safely stand on this against our ad∣uersaries, that it is not loue (admit it to bee most perfect) that can iustifie vs in the sight of God: because it cannot procure remission of the least sinne. VER. 15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which yee are called in one body, and be yee amiable. In this verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colos∣sians to an other vertue, namely to peace the fruit of loue, and to this also he exhorts, not simply, but by comparison, that they should haue peace in them, and that it should be as a ruler, and beare principall sway in them, and this exhortation he doth further amplifie, First, by the author, or kind of peace, that it ought to be the peace of God. And Secondly, by the proper seat where it ought to rule, namely, in their hearts. And his exhortation being thus propounded, hee doth further strengthen it, and vrge it on the Colossians by waight of argument, taken from the condition of their calling, that they were called to this peace, expressed more cleare∣lie in those words, (in one body) wherein also is implied an argument, to perswade them to it, that they were called
vnto it as members of one body. Last of all for the better entertainement and continuance of this peace, he requires of them that they should be amiable: and so the summe and substance of this verse is, 1 An exhortation to peace, and that, a peace of God, and that it ought to beare rule in their hearts. 2 Backed and strengthned by an argument taken from their calling, that they were called vnto it as members of one body. 3 And then further amplified, by requiring ano∣ther duty seruing for the continuance of that peace, that for the better entertainement and continuance of it, they should be amiable, or gratefull one to another. Come we to speake of the exhortation in these wordes. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Interpreta∣tion.By the peace of God, the Apostle meanes not that peace that God himselfe hath, and in which hee liueth, but that which he communicateth to vs; and that is twofold: the first is that peace we haue with God, arising from faith, tou∣ching our reconciliation with God, in, and thorow Christ, whereof the Apostle speakes, Rom. 5.1. Being iustified by faith wee haue peace towards God thorow our Lord Iesus Christ. And Philip. 4.7. The peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding, shall preserue your hearts and mindes in Christ Iesus, but this peace is not heere meant: the o∣ther peace, is that which wee haue, or ought to haue with men, namely, that concord and good agreement, com∣ming from loue, which we ought to haue one with ano∣ther; and of this the Apostle speakes in this place, as may easily appeare, both by the context, and by the scope and drift of the Apostle in this place. Now this peace is called the peace of God, because God is the author of it, both commanding it in his word, and working it in vs by his holy Spirit.
(Rule in your heart) The word heere translated (Rule) properly signifieth to rule after the manner of a Iudge, or an vmpire, it is taken from the custome of the heathen, who in their publike games of wrestling, or the like, had some who sate as Iudges, and did rule and order the run∣ners or wrestlers, and gaue to them that did best some re∣wards; and the Apostles meaning is, let the peace of God preuaile ouer all your euill affections, which stirre you vp to discord and dissention, and let it beare sway, and haue chiefe command of them all, and keepe them vnder. Thus then we are to conceiue the meaning of this ex∣hortation, as if the Apostle had said. And let that concord and good agreement com∣ming from loue, which you ought to haue one to another, commanded by God in his word, and wrought in you by his holy Spirit, haue the chiefe sway, and preuaile ouer all your euill affections, by which you are stird vp to discord and dissenti∣on, let it be as a commander ouer them all, and keepe them all in subiection. Now heere, first we are to marke, that the Apostle cals the peace to which he exhorts, being that peace that is, or ought to be amongst men, the peace of God, or Gods peace, (saith he) Let the peace of God, euen that peace that hath God the author, commander, and worker of it, rule in your hearts. Hence it is cleare. That true Christian peace, and good agreement a∣mongst men is, as well as true Christian loue, a worke of Gods spirit;e Christiā race is a fruit of Gods spirit. and indeed the Apostle reckons it vp amongs the fruites of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. And therefore men e not truely peaceable by nature, neither is their any rue peace, saue among such as are truely sanctified. Let it suffiice onely to haue named that in a word, the
point more cleare hence offered is this. The peace and agreement one with another, which we are to entertaine and embrace,The peace & agreement we hold one with another must be Gods peace, euen such a peace as is approued of by God in his word. must bee Gods peace, euen such a peace as hath God the author of it, such a peace as is commanded and approued of, by God in his word; and that we erre not in conceiuing this point, thinking that, a peace commanded and approued of God, which is not. Know we further more particularly, that the peace and agreement we are to hold and embrace with men, it must be ioined with truth of religion,Note. ☞ and with holinesse, it must bee a peace thus qualified, euen a peace going hand in hand with truth and holinesse. And hence it is, that the Apostle, Rom. 12.18. doth exhort to peace, not absolutely, but with condition of pos∣sibility. If it be possible (saith he) haue peace with all men. Where hee meanes not, a possibility of fact, as if hee had said, if it be possible, if it may bee done and brought to passe, if you may by any way, or meanes, haue peace with all, (for their is possibility of peace, vnlawfull) but hee meanes a possibility in respect of right and lawful∣nesse of fact; his meaning is, if it be possible, and so as you may lawfully, regarding good conscience, if you may haue it so, as may stand with holding true faith, and reli∣gion towards God, and so as you may still continue in the true feare of God, and holinesse, then haue peace with all, Heb. 12.14. saith the holy Ghost, follow peace with all men, and holinesse, without the which no man shall see the Lord. Where we see a manifest limitation of peace, wee must haue peace with all men,  but in holinesse, and in the Lord; and the reason of this is plaine, namely this; peace with en is not simply good, and euer good without excep∣tio, but then only, when it goes hand in hand with truth and linesse, then indeed it is Gods peace. First herefore, is it so that the peace wee are to holde
with men, must be ioined with truth of religion and holi∣nesse: we haue then good and sufficient warrant for our refusall of a pacification with the Papists in respect of re∣ligion,We haue suf∣ficient war∣rant for our refusall of a pacification with the Pa∣pists in respect of religion. wee haue good reason for it, not to make peace with them, nor to consent with them in regard of religi∣on, because peace with them in that respect, would not be Gods peace, the peace that is of God, must bee peace in truth and holinesse, and wee must remember that Christ, he is the way, the life, and the truth; and therefore to haue contention with such as hold not the truth in him, is no breach of peace. Isa. 59.4. We read that the Lord cals for contention, yea hee was angry that none would make dissention, in taking part with the truth. No man (saith he) contendeth for the truth. It is the opinion of some, that there might be a pacification betweene vs and the Pa∣pists in respect of religion, if there were on both sides but a little yeelding: its true indeede, by yeelding their is some likelihood, and a generall possibility, but no lawfull possibilitie of peace betweene vs, because (as they grant) there must be a yeelding on both sides, but that we may not admit on our part, because the religion wee holde and professe, is the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, grounded on the truth of the word of God, from which we may not swerue on haires breadth. Againe, it is so, that the peace we holde with men must  goe hand in hand with holinesse?Our peace with men and our agreemēt with them must not bee in prophane∣nesse and sin. Then take wee know∣ledge of it, that our peace and agreement with men must not be as commonly it is in the world, a peace and agree∣ment with them, in prophanesse and sinne, a drunken peace, commonly called, good fellowship. No, no, that is not a peace of God, but the Deuils peace, and wee are to be enemies, and at vtter defiance with such peace, wee haue Dauids example for it, Psal. 49.16. saith Dauid there; Who will rise vp with me against the wicked, or who will take my part against the workers of iniquitie. Where we see he vtters a voice of dissention, if euer there were any,
yea that which one calls the foame of dissention, Dauid is so farre from ioyning hands with the wicked in their sin, as that he proclaimes a partaking against them, and his example must we follow, it must befarre from vs to ioyne hands with the wicked and prophane men in their sinne, yea in respect of their wickednesse and prophanenesse, I dare be bold to affirme, we are to bee contentious with an holy contention, not with bitternes & brawling, as Ieremie cries out, Ier. 15.10. Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a contentious man, and a man that striueth with the whole earth, which was in respect of the wickednes of that time. Let then the world charge such, as in zeale to Gods glory, and in a Christian care to discharge the of∣fice of true friends doe reprooue others, happilie their neighbours for their grosse sinnes, and tell them of their swearing, cursing, and such like; let, I say, the world taxe them to be troublesome men, and busie bodies, and such as no man can liue in peace by, yet let them still goe on in that duty, and know its not onely lawfull, but their dutie, to contend with prophane persons, and in respect of their wickednesse, to be contentious with them: the peace wee are to hold with men, must be Gods peace, euen such as is ioined with holinesse and good conscience. Obserue we in the next place, the Apostle saith not, let the peace of God be in you, but let it rule in you: the du∣ty hence offered is soone gathered, namely this. The peace of God, an holy, and religious peace, must not onely haue place, but a principall place in vs, it must be a predomi∣nant and ruling peace. Now the word (Rule) as we know) is a word of relation, it hath respect to things ruled, and the things, an holy peace must rule and order, are our euill lusts and affecti∣ons, that stirre vs vp to discord, and dissention, as pride, enuie, couetousnesse, and the like, and so the dutie is thus to be conceiued.
We must carry in vs such a peace as is able to keep down  all our euill lusts and affections that stir vs vp to discordWe must car∣ry in vs such a peace, as is a∣ble to ouer∣rule all our e∣uill lusts and affections, stirring vs vp to discord. & dissention, wee must haue in vs a peace so strong and so powerfull, as neither pride, enuy, couetousnesse, nor any other euill lust or affection, shall be able to preuaile, or to breake out with any contention. And the reason & ground of this is giuen, Iam. 4.1. the Apostle there shewes by the contrary, that where peace doth not rule, there our euill lusts and affections,  breake out into iarres and dissentions, whence (saith he) are wars and contentions among you? are they not hence? euen of your lust, that fight in your members from your lusts, preuailing in your hearts, and vsing your members as weapons of discord and dissention? thereby implying that where peace is wanting, or doth not rule in mens harts there follow iarres, discords and dissentions. Teaching vs this duty. That peace ought so to rule and command our euill lusts, and affections, as they shall not be able to fight in our members, nor to breake out into iars and contentions. Now if this duty be duly considered we shall finde that  many are much defectiue in it.Reproofe of such as are de∣fectiue in this duty. Doe not the common brawles, and needelesse contentions that are amongest men, plainely shew it, that peace is not predominant in them? when men are at difference and contention one with another, are they not hardly drawen to peace or any agreement? as the common saying is, a Beare might as easily bee drawen to the stake, as many men to vnion and good agreement, when they are vrged vnto it, doth not then their pride, their enuie, or some other euill lust or affection worke within them, and so farre preuaile, as they will not bee perswaded to it? And what is this, but a plaine demonstration, that holy and religious peace bears no rule in them, but they are ouerruled by their owne euill lust and affections, and they fight in their mem∣bers.
Well let vs take notice of that which is amisse in vs, and  learne to refraine it, and neuer rest till we find such a peace wrought in vs,We must la∣bour to finde such a peace in vs, as is a∣ble to keepe vnder all our euill lusts and affections, how we may attain vnto it. as is able to keepe vnder all our euill lusts and affections, and to that end carrie in thee a loue and desire of peace, for they that haue no desire to it, can ne∣ueuer haue it to rule in them. And againe, search thine owne heart, and finde out that lust that is the chiefe cause of contention in thee, labour to dispossesse thine heart of that, and to stirre thee vp to this, remember onely this one thing. If peace and good agreement with men, rule not in thee, certainely thou hast no true peace with God, and if thou haue a settled peace of heart towards God, of neces∣sity thou must be at vnity and peace with men, this will e∣uer follow on the former. If then thou desire assurance of thy peace with God, la∣bour thou to get such a peace with men, as hath the com∣mand ouer all thy euill lusts and affections. The Apostle saith, let the peace of God rule in your hearts:The proper seat of true peace is the heart. Hence note we further, That the proper seat of holy peace is the hart, it is a smal thing to haue peace in our mouthes and tongues, when we haue warre in our hearts, for so may hypocrites, as the Prophet complained, Ierem. 9.8. yea, a man may be kept from discord and contention, outwardly by restraining grace, but if peace rule in the heart, that is a worke of Gods Spirit. Come we to the argument the Apostle doth here subioin to his exhortation, for the enforcing of it on the Colossi∣ans, together with the amplification of it in these words (to the which ye are called in one body) the argument as wee may easily see, is from the condition of the Colossians, that they were called to peace as the members of one bo∣dy, and therefore ought to entertaine it, and to haue it ru∣ling in their hearts.
The amplification is as we shewed, by requiring of them another duty seruing for the better entertainment and continuance of peace, namely, that to that end they should be Amiable or gratefull (to the which) that is to say,Interpreta∣tion. to which peace of God before spoken of (yee are called) that is to say, ye are bound by your calling, as you are Christi∣ans, and called to the profession of the Gospell, for when a man is sayd to be called to anie dutie, thereby is not on∣ly signified that it is lawfull for him to doe that dutie, but that by his calling hee is bound to the performance and practise of it (in one body) that is, as the members of one body, being gathered and knit together, by the spirit of God, as members of one bodie vnder one head, Christ Ie∣sus (and be ye amiable) that is, according to the true and proper signification of the word, be ye gratefull or thank∣full, which is not to bee vnderstood (as some would haue it) with relation to God, as if the meaning were, bee yee thankefull to God, for of that the Apostle speakes after∣ward verse 17. and heere he entreats of duties that passe from man to man, & are to be performed of man to man: it is therfore to be vnderstood with relation to men, be ye gratefull or thankfull one to another, as well in conferring as in requiring of benefits, thus then conceiue wee these words, as if the Apostle had sayd. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, for why, it is a duty you are bound to, as you are called to bee true pro∣fessours of the Gospell, gathered and knit together by the spirit of God, as members into one body, vnder one head Christ Iesus, and that you may better entertaine and continue this peace among you, be ye gratefull one to another, aswell in conferring, as in requiring of be∣nefits. First, we are heere to marke that the Apostle doth vrge peace on the Colossians, & perswade them to it, by an ar∣gument taken from their Christian calling, that they were called to it, in that they were Christians, and professors of
the Gospell, and therefore ought to haue it ruling in their hearts: whence we may easily see. That the remembrance, and confideration of our Chri∣stian calling and profession, ought to sway and preuaile with vs, to mooue vs to holy duties. This generally might be stood on, but wee haue often had occasion to speake of it, and therefore we will keepe to the particular heere vrged by the Apostle, hence then we are taught thus much. That Christians & professors of the Gospell, are bound to peace and good agreement one with another, by their calling & profession,Christians & professours of the Gospell, are bound to peace and god agree∣ment one with another, by their cal∣ling an pro∣fession. our calling & profession of the Go∣spel & Christianity, doth or should bind vs to the peace of God, an holy & religious peace, is a duty to which we are called, a duty that belongs to vs, in respect of our Christian calling & profession. For why. True beleeuing Christians & professors of the gospell, are called to be childrē of God, & hee is the God of peace, the author of holy peace, not of discord,  they are called the professors of the Gospell, and that is a word of glad tydings & peace, yea, it makes lambs of lyons, the Prophet, speaking of the fruits of the gospel, in the kingdom of Christ faith, The wolfe shall dwell with the lamb, & the leopard shall ly with the kid, & the calfe, & the ly∣on,Isa. 11.6. & the fat beast together, & a little childe shall bind them, meaning that in the kingdom of Christ, the gospell should make the most mighty, fearce & cruell, euen as lyons and wolues, & such like, put off their woluish & lionlike nature becom mild, gentle & peaceable, yea, true Christians are called by to haue interest and title in the couenant of grace which is also a couenant of peace, they are called to haue peace with God, and peace with their owne conscience, & therfore without questiō holy & religious peace with men is a duty to which they are bound, & belonging to them in respect of their Christian calling, and this being cleere, let vs think on it, to this purpose; is it so, that an holy & religi∣ous peace, with men is a duty that belongs to vs in respect of Christian calling? certainely, then it must needs follow
that such as are at iarre, discord, and dissention with o∣thers, offend against Christian calling, and not only neg∣lect  the duty of that calling, but goe directly against it,Such as are at iarre and discord with others, offend against Chri∣stian calling. ☜ and contrary to it, and so doing, their case and condition is most fearefull; such as do any thing either without the compasse of their particular and personall calling, or a∣gainst it sinne, greeuously, and bring themselues in danger of all Gods iudgements, for men haue assurance of Gods protection, onely so long as they keep themselues within the wayes of their callings, Psal. 91.11. if they goe out of them, they bereaue themselues of Gods protection, and lay themselues open to all his plagues and iudgements; yea, the text is plain, Mat. 24. that the Lord at the day of iudgement will deale seuerely with such as shall be found at his comming, either neglecting the duties of their cal∣lings, or doing contrary, verse 51. it is sayd, hee will then cut off the euill seruant, & giue him his portion with hypo∣crites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. If this be the case of such, as either neglect the duties of their per∣sonall callings, or doe the contrary, how fearefull then is the case of such as not onely neglect, but doe the contrary to the duty of their generall calling of Christianity and profession of the Gospell, which is more excellent then all particular callings? surely, wee must of force confesse their case to be most fearefull, art thou called to peace with men? is peace a duty that belongs to thee, in respect of thy Chri∣stian calling? doest thou not onely neglect that duty, but practise the contrary? art thou found at iarre, at discord and dissention with others? surely, then thou liest naked and o∣pē to all the fearfull strokes of Gods punishing hand in this life, and if the Lord should take thee away (as thou hast no assurance of thy life, one minute of an houre) if the Lord should take thee away in thy brawling and contention, then woe to thee, it had beene better for thee thou hadst neuer been borne, without the extraordinary & vnspeakable mer∣cy of God, thy body then fals to the ground, but thy soule
goes downe into hell. Oh that such as be at dissention and discord with others, had hearts to consider this, would they then goe on in their brawle and contentions? would they then carry them∣selues like lyons or beares, and happily please themselues, in their beastlike nature & behauior? I am perswaded if hell haue not taken full possession of them, they would not, this day, before to morrow, they would seek to be reconciled, & to haue peace with all men, therfore consider it seriously. That peace with men is a duty of thy calling, as thou art a Christian. And if thou be found in that which is contrary o it, in discord and dissention, thy case is most fearefull, & lets vs all consider, how vnworthy and vnbeseeming our high and excellent calling it is to giue our selues to conten∣tion and debate, let them that are not called to peace con∣tend and make debate, as for vs the condition of our cal∣ling will not beare it, either we must renounce contention, or else disclaime the calling of Christians. Marke wee further, the Apostle saith, not onely let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you are called, but hee addes further in one bodie, more clearely expres∣sing it, how they were called to peace (namely) as the mem∣bers  of one body, the point hence offered is this. Christians are to haue & to hold peace and good a∣greement one with another, as members of one and the same body.That Christians are to haue and to hold peace, concord and good agreement one with another, as members of one and the same bodie, for indeed they are one bodie in Christ, and euerie one, one anothers members, Rom. 12 5. We find this duty propounded in these termes, in many places of Scripture, Eph. 4.3. the Apostle hauing exhorted to keep the vnitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace, he ads this as one speciall reason and ground of it,  verse 4. there is one body and one spirit, euen as ye are called in one hope of your vocation, no doubt this duety is well knowen to most men in speculation, the Scripture is so plaine and plentifull in the manifestation and proofe of it: and there∣fore for the vse of it.
Let it serue as a ground of further exhortation to peace & good agreement one with another,  The conside∣ration of this, that we are members of one body, ought to bee most effectu∣all to moue vs to good a∣greement one with another many reasons might be brought to mooue vs heereunto, as our coniunction in one nature, country, place, habitation, law, liberty, and religion, all which are of great waight, to mooue vs to haue peace & good agreement, but aboue all, this is of greatest waight, & most effectuall, that we are members of one body, for the very light and order of nature, teacheth the members of the same body, to be at peace one with another, what member of the body falleth out or disagreeth with another, no man yet euer hated his owne flesh, Eph. 5.29, we cannot giue in∣stance or example of any, well in his wits, that did euer hate or hurt his owne body, or that any one member of a mans body, was at iarre and discord with another: if then the consideration of this, that we are members of one and the same body, moue vs not to liue in peace and good agree∣ment, it will conuince vs of sinne against the light of nature, yea more, euen of sin against the light of grace, in that the holy Ghost hath reuealed it to vs, that we are knit together by one spirit, one faith, and one hope of saluation, let then the consideration of our neere vnion into one body, vnder one head, Christ Iesus, mooue vs to peace and good agree∣ment, if it do not, surely it argues we are none of the mem∣bers of that body. Now here a question  comes to be answe∣red, in that the Apostle saith, we are called to peace in one body, as members of one body vnder one head, Christ Ie∣sus, it may be demaunded whether wee may haue peace with such as are enemies to the Church, and so (as farre as we can conceiue) as yet not members with vs of the same body, nor vnder the same head Christ Iesus, but are vnder Antichrist: this question was in part answered before,  but for more full answer to it, know we, that there is a twofold peace, a peace in respect of ciuill affaires, or a peace in re∣spect of religion, the first of these we may haue with the eni∣mies of the Church, yea, in respect of ciuill busines, we may make a league or couenant of peace with them, as Abraham
did with Abimelech, Gen. 21.32. Isaac with Abimelech, Gen. 29.31. but in respect of religiō, we may not make peace with the enemies of the Church, for that were to ioine light and darknes, truth & falshood, which can neuer stand together. Come we to the last thing here required of the Colossians (and be ye amiable) I wil not handle this as a duty stāding by it selfe, but as here it stands in relation to peace, being here required by the Apostle, as a means of better entertainment & continuance of peace, & so the point hence offred, is this. That an effectuall meanes, either to procure and pur∣chase peace and concord,An effectuall meanes either to procure peace, where it is not, or to continue it where it is, is gratifying one another by mutuall benefit. where it it is not, or to continue it where it is, is gratifying, and pleasuring one another by mutuall benefits, by conferring and requiting of benefits. This will best appeare by particulars, as it is a notable meanes either to procure or to continue peace by sending gifts & presents one to another, they commonly preuaile whersoeuer, or which way soeuer they go. A singular exam¦ple we haue in the gifts and presents that Iacob sent to Esau, he saith, he sent thē, that he might find fauor in his sight for the procuring of peace, & agreement between them, as gifts of pacification, & the Lord gaue a blessing to that end; so likewise lending one another mony, houshold stuffe, and things needfull,  accompanying each other in our iournies, as the Elders of Ephesus did Paul to the ship,Our mony & other out∣ward good things are not onely to be put to neces∣sary vses, but also to be vsed for procurement and continu∣ance of peace and good a∣greement with one an∣other. Act. 20.30. in∣uiting one another to our tables and such like, are notable meanes, both to procure & to continue peace and good a∣grement, we read Iude Epist. verse 12. that Christians in the Apostles daies, had their loue feasts, which were for the te∣stfying and continuance of their loue and vnity. The vse of this, teacheth vs not only the lawfulnes of these things, that we may lawfully send presents one to another, but it teacheth an excellent vse that is to be made of our mo¦ny, & other such things, that they are giuen vs, not only for our necessity, & to prouide vs food, or to shew our liberality but also to win & keep the good affection of our brethren, & for procuring continuance of peace & concord with thē
and let vs look that among other vses, we make this one principal vse of our riches, & outward good things, & abi∣lities; worldly goods cōmonly part friends, as they did Ia∣cob & Laban, Ge. 31. thorow our corruptiō they are means of strife and disagreement, and the very matter of the greatest cotention; but they that so vse them (as one saith well) the time will come when they shall wish, they had neuer gone further then the shouell, or spade. We must so vse them, as they may bee meanes of peace and concord, and then, no doubt, we shall find the blessing of God vp∣on them, and comfort in the vse of them, when wee stand in most need of comfort. VER 16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you plente∣ously in all wisdome, teaching and admoni∣shing your owne selues, in Psalmes, and Hymnes of spirituall songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. The Apostle from verse, 5. of this Chapter to this 16. verse hath exhorted the Colossians, both to the mortifying, and putting away of such vices and sinnes, as are forbid∣den in the second Table of the Commandements and to the putting on, and taking to themselues such vertues as are there required: and hauing ended that his exhortati∣on; In this 16. verse, and in this 17. vers. following, he ex∣horts them to the duties of the first Table, as to diligent study of the word of God, to inuocation, and calling on God in the name of Christ, and to thankesgiuing. This verse for the dependance of it, hath reference and respect to matter foregoing, on this manner. The Apostle hauing exhorted the Colossians plentifully to sanctification, aswell in putting off the old man with his workes, as in putting on the newe man with his parts. To the end they might do these things, in this vers. he ex∣horts them to a familiar acquaintance of the word of God. That, to that end they should haue the word of God as a
domesticke, as a dweller with them, and familiar vnto them. In this verse considered by it selfe, we haue these things laid before vs. First, the Apostle doth exhort the Colossians, that the word of Christ should be a dweller among them. And that he doth further amplifie both by the measure of the word, that ought to dwell with them, indefinitely propounded, that it ought to be a plentifull measure. And also by the manner of the dwelling of it, that it dwell with them in all wisdome, Let the the word of Christ dwell in you plentifully in all wisdome. After this, the Apostle doth presse vpon the Colossians the vse of the word of Christ dwelling among them, that they ought to make a double vse of it, euen thereby to teach, and to admonish, both themselues and others: tea∣ching and admonishing your owne selues. And he expresseth some particulars wherein they should teach and admonish themselues, and others, (namely) in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs. Wherein is also implied, how farre foorth the word of Christ should bee familiar to them, (namely) so farre foorth as it should serue for the matter of their mirth, that when they had occasion to reioice, they should be able to sing out of the word of God, Psalmes, and hymnes, and spi∣rituall songs, and hauing made mention of Psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, the matter of their mirth. Hee setteth downe further the manner how they should vse them, as that for the generall, they should sing them, and in speciall, with grace in their hearts, and to the Lord, Singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. So then the summe of this verse is, The argumēt of the verse.An exhortation to the Colossians, to haue a plentifull measure of the word of Christ, familiar to them, and so as they should bee able wisely to
vse it for the instruction and admonition of them∣selues and others; yea, to make vse of it in their mirth shewing foorth their mirth in singing af∣ter an holy manner, in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, singing with a grace in their hearts to the Lord. Come we to the words of this verse, and first of these words (Let the words of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisdome.) The word of Christ doth in speciall signifie the Gospel, the doctrine of grace and reconciliation with God in, and thorow Christ. But heere it is to be taken in a larger sense and significa∣tion, euen for the whole written word of God,Interpreta∣tion. that being giuen by inspiration of God, 2 Tim. 3.16. and profitable to the vses heere limited, and specified, to teach and to ad∣monish. Now the whole Scripture is called the word of Christ, both because he is the author of it, for hee it was that spake by Moses, and the Prophets, it was the Lord Christ that sent Isaiah the Prophet, as may plainly appeare by conference of Isaiah, 6.9.10. and Ioh. 12.40.41. and so he sent other Prophets successiuely time after time: and because he is the matter and ende of the whole Scripture, Iohn 5.46. Moses wrot of him, as Gen. 3.15. and in the ceremony of the Paschall Lambe, in the type of the Taber∣nacle, the Arke, all Sacrifices, the brasen Serpent; yea, the whole Scripture propounds Christ to vs the onely media∣tor and Sauiour, and to him is the whole Scripture refer∣red as the end of it, Rom. 10.4. He is the end of the Law, &c. And againe, Gal. 3.24. The Law was our Scholemaster to bring vs to Christ, and doth leade vs to Christ; and for these reasons is it that the whole Scripture is called the word of Christ, (dwell) the word heere translated (dwell) properly signifies to inhabite, or dwell as a domesticke, as one of the same house,; it is a Metaphor taken from such as dwell vnder one and the same roofe with vs, who
who are best knowne to vs, and most familiar with vs, and the Apostles meaning is, that the word of God should bee as well knowne and familiar to vs, as he or shee that dwels with vs in one and the same house, (in you) that is, amongst you; let it dwell amongst you, and bee familiar to you, (plenteously) that is, in aboundance and great measure, (in all wisdome) that is, in true and sound wisdome; it is vsuall in Scripture to put the note of vniuersalitie (all) to sig∣nifie excellency, perfection, truth, and soundnesse. And the wisdome heere spoken of, is not the wisdome of the word it selfe, but the wisdome that ought to bee in them, to whom the word is familiar; and the Apostles meaning is, that they should be wise in the vnderstanding and vse of the word, being familiar to them, that they should wisely vnderstand it, and wisely vse it. Thus then wee are to conceiue these wordes, as if the Apostle had said. Let a plentifull measure of the written word of God be as familiar,Meaning of the text. and well knowne to you, as a dweller with you in one and the same house, so as in true wisdome you both vnderstand it, and vse it. Obseru.Wee are heere to marke first of all, that the Apostle ha∣uing exhorted the Colossians, to the mortification, and to the putting away of sundrie vices,Vers. 5. as fornication, vnclean∣nesse, the inordinate affection, euill concupiscence, and couetousnesse which is Idolatry, and to the putting on and practise of many vertues, as tender mercy, kindnesse humblenesse of minde,Vers. 12.13.14.15 meekenesse, long suffering, for∣bearing one another, and forgiuing one another, and a∣boue all, loue, which is the bond of perfection and peace. He now comes to exhort them to haue the word of God familiar to them, as a meanes to make them able to pra∣ctise
that, to which he hath hitherto exhorted. And hence we may take this conclusion. That the onely effectual meanes seruing for the morti∣fication and putting away of sinne, and for the putting on,The onely ef∣fectual means seruing for the mortification of sinne, and for the putting on and pra∣ctise of vertue, is the word of God. and practise of vertue, is the word of God, no other thing is able to make vs truely to abstaine from sinne, and to practise vertue, but onely the word of God. Morall precepts of Philosophers and wise men, a good name, good company, good education, good examples, and such like, though they be excellent things, and of ex∣cellent vse, yet they are not able to doe this, to make vs truly to mortifie sinne, and put on, and practise vertue, on∣lie the word of God is able to doe that. And hence it is, that our Sauiour praying for his Apostles, and all other that should beleeue in him, thorow their teaching: hee saith, Ioh. 17.17. Sanctifie them with the truth, thy word is truth. And Ioh. 15.3. Yee are cleane (saith hee) thorow the word which I haue spoken vnto you. Psalm. 119.9. Dauid hauing propounded the question; wherewithal shal a young man redresse his way, as if hee had said, where∣with shall a man most vnbrideled, vntamed, and vnrefor∣med, come to be bridled, tamed, and reformed: hee pre∣sently answers himselfe, euen by no other thing, but by the word of God, which is a plaine proofe of this point, that the word of God is the onely powerfull meanes that serues for the purging out, and putting away of sinne, and for the putting on and practise of ver∣tue. The reasons of this are plaine. First, onely the word of God pierceth into the hearts of  men, from whence all actions good and bad proceede, Heb. 4.12. Secondly, nothing is able to make that which is spoken  to vs effectuall, but the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God worketh by the word, and therefore its the word of God, that is onely an effectuall meanes of the mortifica∣tion
of sinne, and of the putting on and practise of ho∣linesse. Hence it appeares plainely, wee may easily see it, that the Papists are no such friends to good workes as they would make the world beleeue,The Papists are no such friends to good works as they would make men be∣leeue. they pretend that they are most zealous of good works, and such friends to holinesse of life, as none are like them, and they cry out against vs as enemies of good workes; but indeed, if we duely consi∣der the matter, we shall finde none greater enemies to good works, and true holines then they, insomuch as they take order that there may bee no familiarity or acquain∣tance betwixt the people, and the word of God; for they straitly forbid the people to read the word of God, or to haue it in their mother tongue: it is the word of God that is the onely effectuall meanes to worke true mortification and holinesse, and will they barre the people from that, and yet pretend that they are the onely friends and fauou∣rers of good workes? Is any so simple that sees not their deceit? And who cannot easily discerne, that their pra∣ctise is in flat opposition, and contrariety to their word? I leaue them, and for vse of the point to our selues. Is it so, that the word of God is the onely effectuall meanes to worke true mortification and holinesse of life?If a man would be sure that he is tru∣ly mortified, and made tru∣lie holy, hee must looke that the word of God hath wrought it in him. Then if thou desire to haue sinne truely mortified in thee, and to be renued, and to bee made truely holy (without which, thou shalt neuer see God to thy comfort) neuer rest till thou bee sure that the word of God hath wrought in thee a mortification of thy sinne, and a measure of holi∣nesse; thou maist come to haue a shew of mortification, and holinesse, by other meanes, but true mortification and holinesse is onely wrought in thee by the word of God; and therefore neuer rest till thou finde that the word of God hath beene powerfull in thee to that pur∣pose. Happily thou wilt say, how shall I know that the word of God, hath been thus powerfull in me to the mortifica∣tion
of my sinne, and to worke holinesse in me? I abstaine from sinnes, yea, I can name particular sinnes to which heretofore I haue yeelded, but now I abstaine from them, am not I then mortified? Answer:  Thou shalt know it, especially by two things: First, if thou camest to the sight of thy sinnes by the Law of God, Rom. 3.20. By the the Law commeth the knowledge of sinne. And Secondly, by the affection both to the Lawe, and to thy sinne, if thou loue the Law of God, euen because it discouereth thy sinne, and the more it discouereth thy sinne, the more thou louest it, as Dauid did, Psalm. 119.143. And if thou hate thy sinne principally, because God hates and forbids it, and not in any sinister respect. These are sure notes that the word of God hath beene effectuall to worke in thee a mortification of thy sinne, and neuer rest till thou finde these things in thy selfe. The next thing wee haue to marke is, that the Apostle calles the written word of God, the word of Christ) Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenteously, &c. Hence it is plaine that Christ speakes to vs in the writ∣ten  word; yea, Christ speakes to vs in any doctrine,Christ speakes to vs in the written word of God, and in euery do∣ctrine there expressed, or there gathe∣red by neces∣sarie conse∣quent. either plainely expressed in the written word of God, or thence gathered by necessary and good consequent, that doctrin so expressed, or so gathered, is the word of Christ; our Sauiour saith, Luke 10.16. to the 70. Disciples, hee that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you, despi∣seth me. The meaning is not; Whosoeuer heareth man called to teach, heares me simply, whatsoeuer he teacheth, but so long as man teacheth Gods word. And that appeares planely, Iohn 14.26. Where Christ promiseth, that his Spirit shold suggest, and bring all things to the mindes of hi Disciples, and their followers; and he addes, which he had told and taught them, and not any new doctrine and reuelations. So long then as the Do∣ctrine
is either plainely expressed in the written word of God, or thence gathered by good and necessarie conse∣quent, it is the word of Christ, and so to be heard and re∣ceiued of vs as the word of Iesus Christ. This I note to shew the vanity of some phantasticke spi∣rits, who bragge much of illumination of the Spirit, and depend on their reuelations, beside the written word of God,The vanity of such as rest vpon reuela∣tions, besides the written word of God, discouered. thou must know, whosoueuer thou art, that thy re∣uelation besides the written word of God, is not the tea∣ching of Christ, nor suggested by his spirit, but by the spi∣rit of error, euen of the Deuill, and the word and doctrine of Christ, is the doctrine, either expressed, or agreeable to the written word of God. It is worth our marking, that the Apostle calles his prea∣ching, the ministration of the Spirit, 2. Cor. 3.8. to teach vs, that the word and Spirit euer goe together, the Spirit shineth in the word, and the word is powerfull by the Spi∣rit, and wee must be taught of God, but it must bee by the word, and therefore deceiue not thy selfe by any new vi∣sion or reuelation, besides the written word of God. Marke we further, the Apostle exhortes that the word of God should be as one dwelling with vs vnder the same roofe, as familiar to vs, as a home-dweller. Hence ariseth this duty. That the word of God must not onely bee knowne to vs abroad,We must bee as well ac∣quainted with the word of God, as with an home-dweller. as one that we meete sometimes in publike, but as one of our owne house; we must bee as well acquainted with the word of God, as with one that doth dwell, and conuerse with vs euery day, and lodge with vs euery night, that as wee knowe one with whom wee are familiarly ac∣quainted, not only by face, and can call him by his name, but we know him inwardly, and wee are acquainted with his nature and disposition, and with the very purpose of his heart, so wee must bee acquainted with the word of God. Not onely knowing the face and sentence of the Scrip∣ture,
but the inward purpose and meaning of the holy Ghost in it, especially in the plaine places of it, and such as containe things needefull to bee knowen to saluation, Pro. 7.3. Salomon exhorts vs to bind the instructions of wis∣dome and her commandements, vpon our fingers, and write them vpon the table of our hearts, to haue them e∣uen at our fingers ends, and verse 4. say vnto wisedome, thou art my sister, and call vnderstanding thy kinswoman, bee as familiar with the wisedome of God reuealed in his word, as with thine owne sister, 2. Tim. 3.15. Paul saith, Ti∣mothy knew the holy scriptures of a childe, and therefore doubtlesse they were very familiar to him. And must the word of God be thus familiar to vs, euen  as one of our owne house.The Papists deale iniuri∣ously with their people, in forbidding them to looke into the word of God. How iniuriously then deale the Papists in not suffring their people to haue an insight into it? they say, the people are not without speciall licence to looke into the word of God, but they must receiue all things from their teachers on their bare wordes, not rea∣soning or asking any question more then the horse asketh his rider why he turnes him this way or that way, but sim∣plie obeying. Now what is this, but directly to crosse and contradict the spirit of God? but they obiect  the reading of the Scrip∣ture by the common people, is many times hurtfull, they peruert it, and thence come errours and dangerous opini∣ons? a poore silly shift. Some thorow their owne corruption abuse the rea∣ding of the Scripture,  shall wee therefore take away the right vse of it? the worde preached, by mans corrupti∣on, to some is an occasion of deeper damnation, shall wee therefore condemne or take away the preaching of the word? That is a deceitfull kinde of reasoning.
Let vs further apply the duty to our selues, is it so, that the word of God must bee as familiar to vs,Reproofe of them to whō the word of God is a stranger. as one of our owne house? then thousands in the world, come within compasse of iust reproofe, are there not thousands to whom the word of God, is as a stranger? they know no more the voyce annd face of it, then of any they neuer saw before, they are ignorant not onely of the sentences of Scripture, but euen of the examples of it, which of all things are most easie, yea, of the principal and fundamentall poynts taught in each booke, a fault that cannot sufficiently bee taxed especially in these dayes, and let ignorant persons take knowledge of it, and learne to reforme it, and neuer rest thou till thou bee familiarly acquainted with the word of God, and to that end bee diligent in hearing, reading and meditating in the word of God, and ioyne thereunto con∣ference and prayer, content not thy selfe to meete with the word in publike, but bee acquainted with it at home, turne ouer the leaues of the booke of God in thine owne house, yea, take away sometime from the workes of thy calling to bestow in reading of the Scripture. I cannot read. Then get others that can, to reade to thee, and with greater diligence attend to it. Motiues to stir vs to vp a diligent rea∣ding and at∣tending to the word of God.And to stirre thee vp to this duety, consider onely these two things. First, there is no true comfort to bee found in anything in time of trouble, but in the word of God, Psalme the 119. and 50. Dauid sayth. it was his comfort in trouble, if men in trouble bee not able to comfort themselues out of the worde of God, either they wring their handes, teare their haire and despaire, or else they doe vse some vnlawfull meanes, for indeede if men knowe not God in his worde, they knowe not his mercy, truth, loue, and goodnesse, and what comfort can they then finde in their troubles?
Againe, consider that prayer brings a feeling, and the sacraments a confirming onely of that comfort thou hast in the worde, if thou haue no comfort in the word pray∣er brings no feeling, nor the sacraments a confirmation, of any thing but iudgement and damnation, yea, know it for a truth, the Apostle hath sayd it, Rom. the 2. & 16. thou shalt one day be iudged by the word, and if the word of Christ acquite thee, Christ will acquite thee, and if his worde condemne thee, certainely thou shalt neuer be saued, And therefore thinke on these things, if thou desire to find comfort in thy trouble, if thou wouldest haue prayer bring feeling, and the sacraments a confirming of comfort to thee, and if thou wouldest stand before the iudgement seat of Christ, at his comming, with comfort, then make the word of God thy friend and familiar. True friends will draw neere to comfort vs in distresse, when strangers will flie from vs, and if the worde bee a stranger to thee, and thou to it, what shall bee able to comfort thee? surely nothing, and therefore neuer rest till thou bee familiarly acquainted with the word of God, post it not from thee to schollers and Diuines, no, no, if thou look for comfort in life, in death, in the day of iudg∣ment: labour thou in plentifull measure to be acquainted with the word of God. And touching the measure of the word that ought to be familiar to vs expressed in the word (plenteously) only note we thus much, our Apostle saith not, let the word of Christ dwell fully or wholly, neither yet let a such a portion, such a quantity or measure of the word dwell with you, and no more, but he speakes indefinitely, and saith, let the word of Christ dwel in you plenteously, be familiarly acquainted with a plenteous measure of the word of Christ not expressing how much. Heereby teaching vs. That howsoeuer wee cannot come to a familiar ac∣quaintance
with the whole word of God, that is not pos∣sible  in the time of this life, neither are wee bound vpon hazard of saluation to vnderstand the sence of euery place of Scripture) yet are wee not to content our selues with a limited portion, or with a stinted measure of knowledge in Gods booke,Though we cannot be fa∣miliarly ac∣quainted with the whole word of God yet we must not content our selues with a stinted measure of knowledge in Gods booke. and thinke that when wee haue gotten so much knowledge in the word, wee haue then enough and then set downe our rest, no, we must labour by diligent reading, hearing, and other good meanes, to come to as much knowledge in Gods booke as possibly wee can, the more holy knowledge wee haue in that,  the more shall we see and know Gods loue to vs, and the more shall our hearts be enflamed with true loue to God againe,We must goe on from one measure of knowledge to another. and the better stored with other sancti∣fying graces of the spirit, yea, the more and greater will be our comfort in any time of need. The next thing that comes to bee considered, is the manner how wee are to bee familiarly acquainted with a plenteous measure of the worde of God, namely in (all wis∣dome) (that is) so as in true wisedome, we both vnderstand it, and vse it. Where first note we. That we may come to vnderstand the word of God, e∣uen truely and wisely to vnderstand it,Wee may come to a true and wise vn∣derstanding of the word of God. else this exhortati∣on of the Apostle had beene vaine. Indeede the worde beeing a lanthorne to our feete, and a light vnto our pathes, Psalme 119.105. and spea∣king to vs as to children, Hebr. 12.5, that is easily plain∣ly and familiarly, wee may doubtlesse come to the vnder∣standing of it, yea, the simplest man or woman may come to bee instructed out of the word of God in all poynts of faith and manners needefull to bee knowen to his or her owne saluation Psame 19.7. the testimonies of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisdome vnto the simple, & Psal. 119, 130 the entrance into thy words, sheweth light, & giues under∣standing to the simple, for howsoeuer it cannot be denied, but
there are many things in Scripture hard to bee vnder∣stood, yet whatsoeuer is necessary to bee knowen is plainely set foorth in the Scripture, and easie to bee vn∣derstood of such as with care and conscience vse the meanes. The Papists lay an hardnes and obscurity on the Scrip∣ture,Confutation of the Papists, laying an hard¦nesse and ob∣scurity on the Scripture. and hold that the Scripture, in what language soeuer,  is obscure and hard to bee vnderstood, not onely of the vnlearned, but of the learned also, and that they knowe not when they haue the right vnderstanding of it, which indeede is a most iniurious, and an vnthankefull conceit towards God himselfe, hath the Lord giuen vs his writ∣ten word, wrapped vppe in such cloudes of obscurity, and such doubtfull speech, as it is not possible to know when we haue the true sence of it? no, no, there is no such matter and it is a most wicked thing so to imagine, it had beene farre better then, that no Scripture had beene written at all. There is no doubt, but the Lord purposing to reueale his will to man by the Scripture, hath caused them to bee written in such sort, as man may without any iust cause of doubting vnderstand them aright, at least so much of them as is needfull to be knowen to saluation, that being the ve∣ry end on Gods part, in writing of them as appears plainly, Ioh. 20.31. These things are written that ye might beleeue, that Ie∣sus is the Christ the SON of GOD, and that in belee∣uing yee might haue life. Now the duty which these words (in all wisedome) doe charge vpon vs, is this. We must looke that our familiar acquaintance with a plentifull measure of the word, be in true and sound wise∣dome,Our familiar acquaintance with a plenti∣full measure of Gods word must be in true & sound wisedome. we must be wise both in the vnderstanding and vse of the word, if wee bee able to carrie in minde, and remember many sentences or examples of Scripture, which we haue heard or read, & they are familiar vnto vs,
we must looke that we wisely vnderstand them, and wise∣ly vse them. And if you aske mee wherein stands that wise vnder∣standing,  and wise vse of the sentences of Scripture, and the things we are able to remember out of the word I answer,  in two things. First in a right vnderstanding of them. And secondly, in a right vse of them. As a man is said to bee wise and well seene in any art, when hee is able not onely to repeare the rules of that art, but hee doeth rightly vnderstand them, and can make a right vse of them, so wee are wise in the vnderstanding, and wife in the vse of the sentences, examples, and rules of Scripture, that are familiar to vs, when wee rightly con∣ceiue them, and rightly apply them, when wee vnder∣stand them according to the true meaning of the Holy Ghost, and when we make a right and good vse of them, and are bettered by them, and especially in two re∣spects. First, when we thereby enforme and build vp our selues in things most important, and of greatest waight concer∣ning vs, as wee are Christians, as in faith, the feare of God, loue to God and men, and true comfort both in life and death, and to that end make choice, and spend most time in the studie of such places, and sentences of Scripture, as serue most to that purpose. And secondly, when we thereby enforme our selues in things and duties that most concerne vs and our particular callings. The reason and ground of this duty is, because howso∣euer the word bee in it selfe, the will and wisdome of God reuealed, yet to vs it is not so, being by vs misvnderstood, or vsed amisse, that is onely the good and profitable word of God to vs, that is of vs rightly vnderstood, and rightly vsed, especially so vsed, as that thereby were enforme our selues in things most important, and in duties that most
concerne vs in particular, and therefore wee must be wise in vnderstanding the word aright, and in vsing it aright, especially to enforme vs both in things that concerne our eternall good, and to make vs wise to saluation. 2. Timoth. 3.15. and to enforme vs in our particular and personall dueties, 2. Timoth. 2. wee finde that the Apo∣stle hauing exhorted Timothy to bee constant in vndergo∣ing the labours of his ministry, and in bearing the trou∣bles and afflictions attending on it, verse the seauenth, he sayth, consider what I say, and the Lord giue thee vnder∣standing in all things, as if hee had sayd, heare not these things without consideration, vnderstand mee aright, and the Lord giue thee, that thou mayest both rightly vnderstand, and make a right vse of the things I haue now spoken, that concerne thee for thine owne good, in thy place and calling, 1. Timoth. 1.1.4. Paul biddes Timothy command some that they giue not heede to Genealogies, which sayth hee are endlesse, and breed rather questions then godly edifying, which is by faith. Teaching vs plainely, that when wee looke into the book of God, wee are to make a difference of things,Note and not to spende much time and studie in things of lesse importance, but rather to labour that we may wisely vn∣derstand, and make vse of things that tend to our edifica∣tion and comfort, and so to be wise in the right vnderstan∣ding and vse of the word, being familiar to vs, as we may be bettered by it in things most waighty, and such as con∣cerne vs in particular. Now this duty rightly conceiued, serues to checke and  reproue sundrie sorts of menReproofe of sundry sorts of men. in the world, as namely, all such as abuse the words and sayings of holy Scripture, to make themselues and others merrie, such as make iests of Scripture phrase, such as adulterate and make merchan∣dize of the word of God, 2. Corinth 2, 17. thereby see∣king their owne aduancement in the world, and their owne gaine, such as turne it to Allegories, or such as per∣uert
and wrest it for the maintenance of any errour, and of that sort there be thousands in the world: in reproofe of these I will not stand, but consider we this duty, as it may with more profit concerne our selues; and if we duly con∣sider it, wee shall finde there bee two sorts of men that are thereby iustly to be taxed.Two sorts of men iustly ta∣xed. First, some there be that are acquainted with many pla∣ces of Scripture, they can be plentifull in quotation, and in citing of them, but it is, either for their owne delight, in some curious question, tending rather to strife then to edi∣fication, or for the holding of some false conceit of their owne, as that there is an absolute perfection of holinesse in time of this life, that the Sabboth is ceremoniall, or such like. Againe, some there bee, and those are more common, that are very expert in the duties of other men, and when they heare or read of them, they can say, there is a good lesson for such a one, but as for the things that concerne themselues, either for the information of their iudgements or for the good ordering of their liues, they haue little or no care to be acquainted with them. Is this to bee wise in the vnderstanding and vse of the word? no, no, if the worde were familiar to thee in true wisedome, thou wouldest rather informe thy selfe in those things that most concerne thy selfe, and thine owne place and calling, then in the duties of others, yea thou wouldst  esteeme those the best sermons wherein thou art most ef∣fually taught such things, and therefore remember this duty, thou must be wise in the vnderstanding and vse of the word,We must re∣member this, that we are to be wise in the vnderstan∣ding and vse of the word of God, to the bettering of vs. so as thou mayst be bettered by it in things most important, and such as most concerne thee in particular. Now heere happily some may say. I desire to bee wise in the vnderstanding and vse of the word, euen to bee bettered by it in things most waighty, and concerning my selfe in particular, but how shall I come to that true wisedome?
I answer thee, the meanes to come to it,3. meanes to come to a wise vnder∣standing & vse of the word of God. are especially these. First, thou must bring with thee to the reading or hea∣ring of the word the feare of God, for to them that feare him will the Lord reueale his secret, and his coue∣nant, to giue them vnderstanding, Psalme 25.14. the  feare of God is the beginning of wisdome, Prouerbs 9.10. Secondly, thou must bring with thee an humble minde  laying aside all conceit of thine owne wit, bee it neuer so great; for if thou trust to thine owne wit, thou wilt then seeke to thrust a sense and meaning on the Scrip∣ture,Note. and not suffer thy minde and iudgement to bee informed by it, Psalm. 119.130. The enterance into thy words sheweth light, and giueth vnderstanding to the simple, that is, not to such as haue no wit, nor discretion at all, but such as are lowly in their owne eies, and a∣base the pride of their owne wit, to the wisdome of Gods Spirit, and thou must euer make one place of Scripture agree with an other, for there is a sweet con∣sent of Scripture with Scripture; therefore reade not one sentence alone, but the whole context and compare the like places with it. The last and chiefe meanes, is praier to the Lord, that  he would open the eies of thy minde, and giue thee the Spirit of wisdome. Dauid a man according to Gods owne heart praied at least 10. Psalm. 119. for the teaching of God in the vnderstanding of his Law, much more ought we to doe so. And if thou bee carefull to vse these meanes then no doubt, thou shalt be wise in the vnderstanding and vse of the word, and be bettered by it in things that concerne thy good in this life, and for euer in the life to come. And to stirre thee vp to the practise of this duty, know thus much. There is no comfort (as wee heard) in-time of trou∣ble
but in the word. Now the word of comfort, the sen∣tences of Scripture full of sweet comfort, which thou art able to repeate, is no comfort to thee, vnlesse thou be wise in the vnderstanding and vse of it, for as one saith well, the word of God foolishly vnderstood,Note. is not the word of God to him that so vnderstands it, and therefore bring thou to the hearing, or reading of the word of God, true feare of God in thine heart, lay aside all proud conceit of thine owne wit; bee carefull to make one place of Scripture a∣gree with another, and haue recourse to God by praier, that he would open thy vnderstanding and wit, and then doubtlesse thou shalt haue the word of God familiar to thee in true and sound wisdome, and then shalt thou wise∣lie vnderstand it, and make true vse of it. Come we to the vse of the words, dwelling with vs plen∣teously, heere vrged by the Apostle in these words (teaching and admonishing your owne selues.) Interpre∣tation.(Teaching) that is, instructing, or informing the minde in knowledge, (admonishing) that is, reproouing for that which is amisse in life and conuersation, (your owne selues) the word may be expounded one another mutually, and so the meaning is briefely this, Informing one another mutually in know∣ledge, and reprouing one another for things amisse in life and conuersation. The point hence offered is this. It is not the Ministers office alone to teach and admo∣nish,To teach and to admonish blongs not to Ministers alone, but e∣uen to all that professe Christ. though his especially, and in peculiar sort it belong to him; but its the duty of all that professe Christ, they are to teach and admonish one another, as occasion is of∣fered. Hebrewes 5.12. The author of that Epistle saith, for the time, they ought to haue beene teachers. 1 Thes. 5.14. Admonish them that are vnruely. If we read, Iohn . from verse 35. to 45. we shall finde many examples of this kind; Iohn taught Andrew, and another of his Disciples: An∣drew
instructed Peter; likewise Iesus, Philip; and Philip, Nathaniel. And so it is cleare, that we ought to teach and admonish one another; yea, priuate persons may some∣times instruct teachers in some things in priuate: examples we haue, Act. 18.26. Poore Aquila and Priscilla instru∣cted eloquent Apollos: the text saith, Whom when Aqui∣la and Priscilla had heard they tooke him vnto them, and expounded vnto him the way of God more perfectly, we see then our dutie. Now this duty is little thought on, or practised. Where is almost that man or woman that hath care  to teach, or admonish their brethren, as occasion is offered,Reproofe of such as care not to teach and admonish others vpon iust occasion. the most haue no care to teach or admonish them, that be vnder their charge, much lesse others: well this is our dutie, and learne we to make conscience of it. Againe, is this a duty of priuate persons, to teach and  admonish one an other? Certainly then,Wee are to profit by the teaching and admonition of priuate per∣sons. when this dutie is performed to thee by a priuate person, thou art to profit by it, say not thou as commonly prophane persons vse to say, when thou art iustly admonished of some sin by a pri∣uate person, who made him a teacher? And what haue you to doe to controle me? Doe not so put a stumbling block in thine owne way; know that a priuate person admoni∣shing, and reprouing thee for sinne, iustly, and in the spi∣rit of meekenesse, he is called to it, and it is God that in him reprooues thee, and it is thy duty to suffer thy selfe to bee admonished by him, as from the mouth of God, and therefore doe not lightly regard his admonition, but labour to profit by it, as thou wilt one day answer the contempt of it, beefore him that shall iudge both the quicke and the deade. When God calles by any meanes, doe not thou stubbornely disobey, and cast away thine owne soule. Come we to the particulars heere expressed, wherein wee are to teach and admonish one another, (namely) by Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, together with the
manner, how we are to vse them, as that (for the generall) they are to be song, and for the speciall manner, with grace in our hearts to the Lord. Touching the difference of these three, Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, not to trouble you with varie∣tie of opinions, this is the most receiued distinction of them. Interpreta∣tion.That by Psalmes, wee are to vnderstand holy songs in generall of what argument soeuer written, whether pec∣catorie, and containing matter of petition to God for good things, or deprecatory, containing matter of petition, for turning away of euill things, or Consolatory, containing matter of comfort, or whatsoeuer, which were wont to be sung to God, and sounded out aswell with instrument, as with voice. And by Hymnes are meant, speciall songs of praise to God, thankesgiuings to God for benefits receiued. And by Spirituall songs are signified, certaine speciall hymnes containing the praises of God for his noble acts, for his great and wonderfull workes, which were wont to be song onely with the voice; and such were the songs of Moses, Exod. 15. of Deborah, and Barack, Iudg. 5. and di∣uers such there bee in the Booke of Psalmes, which are therefore called songs, and not Psalmes. The Apostle addes (Spirituall) thereby vnderstanding such songs, as proceede from the Spirit, and are framed by the Spirit, as (namely) such as are, either already recorded in the word, or composed according to the word, containing spirituall and heauenly matter. (Singing) what that is we know, vttering them with a loud tuned, and artificial voice (with a grace in your hearts) (that is) with vnderstan∣ding and feeling hearts, 1 Cor. 14.15. saith the Apostle, I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing with the vnderstanding also, with mindes vnderstanding what is sung, and with hearts full of heauenly ioy, stirred vp and affected accor∣ding to the matter that is sung (to the Lord) that is, to
the praise and glory of God, therin yeelding obdience to God, and with acknowledgement of all praise, honour, and glory to be due to him. Thus then conceiue we the Apostles meaning, as if hee had said, In holy songs to God of what argument soeuer, in songs of praise to God for benefits receiued, and in songs for his great and wonderfull works, those songs being already either pēned by the spi∣rit of God, and found in the Book of God, or fra∣med according to the word, containing spirituall & heauenly matter, singing and sounding them foorth by the voice, both with vnderstanding, what is sung, and with hearts full of heauenly ioy, and affected according to the matter that is sung to the praise and glory of God. Now first, wee are heere to marke that the Apostle, vn∣to teaching and admonishing one another, hee presently subioines in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, not li∣miting the dutie of teaching and admonishing onely to Psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, but pressing that duty vpon the Colossians when they had occasion to bee meery, and did expresse their mirth by any good meanes, that euen then they should teach and admonish one ano∣ther. Our lesson hence is this. That the duty of teaching and admonishing one ano∣ther, the dutie of edifying our brethren, is not to bee ne∣glected in time of our mirth,The duty of edifying one another is not to be negle∣cted in time of our mirth. when wee haue occasion to reioice for the blessings of God, and to shew forth our ioy, by singing or playing on an instrument, or otherwise. to expresse it by lawfull meanes; wee are then euen in our mirth, and ioy, and meerie meetings to glorifie God,  and edifie our brethren. For if that be a truth (as it must needes be) being spo∣ken
by the truth it selfe Mat. 12.36. that of euery idle word men must giue account, then doubtlesse of their idle and vnprofitable singing, and meery-making, not tending to the profit of men, nor the honour of God. And againe, it being the Lord that makes vs glad, and puts cheerefullnesse into our hearts, Act. 14.17. There is reason that he and his children should haue the chiefe, and as it were, the first fruits of the same, and therefore wee are to be mindefull of this duty, euen in our mirth wee are to edifie and doe good to our brethren. A dutie little thought on, and little regarded; nay, most men thinke they are neuer meery,This dutie much negle∣cted amongst men. vnlesse they either sit in the assembly of the mockers, as the Prophet speaks, and which he disclaimed in himselfe, Ierem. 15.17. I sate not in the assembly of the mockers. Vnlesse it bee, either in scoffing, and mocking, and taunting of others; or else they breake out into prophane and vncleane speaches, songs, and daunces, which hurt both themselues and o∣thers, and if happily one of better temper, and more grace tell them, its good to bee meery and wise, or that such mirth as they vse is not fitting; What shall be heare from them but this, or the like speech? He is a precise and me∣lancholie foole, and what doth he in their company, they come together to make meery, and why should they not bee meery, hee disturbes them, and heereupon most men thinke, and sticke not to say it, they cannot bee meerie in the company of a Minister, (if he be not a prophane per∣son) or in the company of one fearing God. Now if these bee our thoughts, wee must learne to re∣forme them,Wee are to practise this dutie. and knowe it is our dutie, euen in our mirth to thinke on the edification of our brethren, and that duty is not to be omitted when we are most meery. A motiue stir∣ring vp vnto it.And that we may bee stirred vp to the practise of it, re∣member we that one day we shall come to be accountable for our mirth, aswell as for other things, and in this respect I may say to thee, whosoeuer thou art, that in thy mirth
dost let thine heart loose to any kind of mirth, and thy mirth tendes altogether to the dishonour of God, and of∣fence of his children, as Salomon doth to the young man, Eccles. 11.9. Goe too, reioice and bee meery, let thine heart cheere thee, follow the waies of thine owne heart, in thy meery-making, lay aside the remembrance of God, and of all goodnesse, but know thou that for all these things, a time will come, wherein thou shalt come to bee accountant and answerable for all these things, before the iudge of all the world; therefore thinke on it, and take heede how thou doest demeane thy selfe in time of thy mirth. The next thing obseruable in these words is, that the Apostle saith, not onely in Psalmes, but he addes further, in Hymnes, and Spirituall songs. Where, note wee, that the Lord in great mercy,Obseru. hath prouided, euen for the wearisomnesse of our nature, if we had beene tyed to one of these sorts of spirituall exerci∣ses, though it were that which we are most fit for, yet such is our nature, wee should haue growne dull and weary of it; the Lord therefore in mercie, hath giuen vs variety, that when wee are wearie of one, wee may take another in hand, but on that I will not further stand. Hence we are plainely taught. That we may lawfully shew foorth our ioy and mirth in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall songs,We may law∣fully shew forth our ioy in singing Psalmes and hymnes, and spiritual songs and we may lawfully make choise of Psalmes and spiritual songs so as they fit our present occasions. its lawfull for vs (the Lord hauing giuen vs occasion) to sing Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, and the Lord hauing gi∣uen vs variety of Psalmes, hymnes, and spirituall songs, wee may lawfully make choise of Psalmes and spirituall songs, and sometimes sing one, and sometimes another; yea, its our dutie to make choise of such Psalmes as are most fitting our present occasion, as we may and ought to come to God, as occasion is offered, with petitions of diuers sorts, with requests, intercessions, deprecatiōs, complaints, &c. as the Apostle hath taught vs. 1. Tim. 2.1. so we may
and ought to come to him with Psalmes and Spirituall songs of diuers arguments, fitting present occasions. Touching the lawfulnesse of singing Psalmes, I hope, we doubt not, we haue Christ his owne example to warrant it, Mark. 14.26. And the example of Paul and Silas, Act. 16.25. & we haue the Apostle Iames his precept, Ia. 5.13. Is any meery, let him sing Psalmes. But for our choise that we are to sing Psalmes according to present occasion, be∣sides the euidence of this text, reade Psalm. 33.3. Dauid there bids vs sing to the Lord a new song; and againe, he repeates the same, Psalm. 96.1. and Reuel. 5.9. The 24. Elders sung a new song. Happily some may say, if wee must sing new songs to God, how then are Dauids Psalmes fit for vs to sing. Answ: Euen Dauids Psalmes are new to vs, when wee make choise of such as are according to our new and pre∣sent occasions, and when we sing them with new affecti∣ons; for then though the words be old, yet the song is new to vs, in the motions and affections of our hearts, and therefore we are to make choise of such Psalmes as fit our present occasion, and to sing them with new affections, I grant indeed, its lawfull at times, which wee set apart to that purpose, to sing the Psalmes of Dauid from the first to the last, one after another in order, but yet if the Lord offer new and present occasion, wee are then to make choise of a Psalme fitting the same. This discouers to vs a notorious wrong the Papists doe the people,A wrong which the Pa∣pists doe to the people discouered. for they restraine and limit the dutie of sing∣ing Psalmes and spirituall songs only to certaine orders of men, and hold it a great offence and sinne for the com∣mon sort of people to sing a Psalme to the Lord; yea, they compell the people vnder them, to abiure the vse of Psalmes, which is a most wicked and iniurious thing. Let vs remember howsoeuer we may sing the Psalmes of Dauid, yet we are not to sing them hand ouer head,
neuer considering what are most fit to bee sung,We are not to sing Psalmes without re∣gard of pre∣sent occasions and without new affecti∣ons. as most doe, especially in priuate, thou must make choice of such a Psalme as is most proper and fit for the present occasion, and sing it with new affections, and to that end thou art to call to minde, and consider the new benefits and blessings, the Lord hath vouchsafed to his Church, to the place where thou liuest, or to thee in particular, & as the Lord doth renue his graces and mercies, either towards his Church, or thy selfe, doe thou renue thy praises to him a∣gaine, and that in singing such Psalmes as are fit for the magnifying of his name for these mercies, and though the Psalme or song bee olde in regard of the words and matter of it, yet let it be as a new song to thee in regarde of the motions and affections of thine heart, yea, some∣times when thou art most merry, and hast occasion of great ioy, in respect of some outward blessing, as happi∣ly the marriage of thy sonne or daughter, or the like, then make thou choyce, not onely of a Psalme where∣in thou mayest praise God for that mercie,Note. but at such a time as that, it will bee good for thee to sing also such a Psalme as may serue to temper and moderate thy ioy. Namely, such a Psalme as containes matter of griefe and sorrow, thereby both to put thee in minde, what was or may bee in thee, and also, to season thy ioy, with the remembrance of the sorrow of Gods Saints. that is al∣so fitting in respect of thy selfe, and thus thou art to bee wise in matter of choyce of the Psalmes thou singest, for doubtlesse, to sing Psalmes without wise discretion and choice, and without new affection, when wee haue new and present occasions, is a profanation of them, and a ta∣king of Gods name in vaine, and what belongs to them that so do? thou art able to remember the Lord will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine, and if the Lord will not who shall then free thee from guiltinesse and sinne?
Marke wee further, the Apostle saith, in Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall songs, singing them with a grace in in your hearts vnto the Lord. Where we may plainely see that the matter of our sing∣ing (if wee sing a ditty) must bee either such songs as are already made,The matter of our singing (if it be a ditty) must be either songs already found in the word of God, or such as are composed ac∣cording to the word. and found in the word of God, or such as are composed according to the worde, it is lawfull for vs to sing other songs besides Psalmes, but our songs must bee spirituall, that is, such as are composed according to the word of God, and containe spirituall matter. Hence it is, that the Apostle, before his exhortation, in effect the same with this Ephes. 5.19. he sets these words verse the 18. bee not drunken with wine, wherein is ex∣cesse, but bee fulfilled with the spirit, as if hee had sayd, as drunkards when they are full of wine and strong drinke then they vse to belch and bellow out, according to the folly and rottennesse of their stinking hearts, carnall and filthy songs, and rimes, so looke that thou bee fulfilled with the Spirit, that from the motion of the Spirit, you may sing songs sutable to such a moouer, containing mat∣ter spirituall and heauenly. Let the matter of your songs bee spirituall, and indeede there is reason for this, because the end of our singing must bee to stirre vp spirituall ioy, that wee may with spi∣rituall alacrity and cheerefulnesse goe about good duties, therefore doubtlesse the matter of our singing must bee either such songs as are found in the word of God, or com∣posed according to the word containing spirituall matter. This therefore meets with all obscene, ribald and filthy songs and sonnets,All obscene ribald, and filthy songs condemned. which are too common in the world, all amorous ballads of loue and lightnesse, that containe matter of filthinesse, and sauour of nothing but the flesh, they are heere condemned, and if the vse of them, then certainly, the buying and selling of them is vtterly vnlaw∣full,Note. yea, they are more fit for Sodome and the stewes, then for a Christian common-wealth, yet they are com∣monly
bought and sold, and people run after them with greedinesse, and what is their plea forsooth, they must needes haue something to passe away the time, and to make them merry, alas poore soules, their mirth in such things, is but as the mirth of poore prisoners, who happi∣ly are frolicke ouer night, and the next day are brought foorth to iudgement, are arraigned, condemned, and shortly after come to bee executed: if thou wilt needes be merry, let the matter of thy mirth bee spirituall, make thy selfe merry in singing Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall songs, that mirth will bring sound and lasting comfort, whereas in the middest of the other mirth, the heart is many times heauie, and the end of that mirth is heauinesse, yea,Prou. 14.13. the songs and laughter of fooles (and such are all they that delight in filthy ribald songs) it is (as the Preacher saith, Eccles. 7.8.) but as the noyse of thornes vnder the pot: it makes a crackling and blaze for a short time, and it is suddenly gone. oh then, let the matter of thy singing be such as may stirre vp spi∣rituall ioy in thee, and bring forth such comfort as may last for euer. In that the Apostle saith in Psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs singing with a grace in your hearts vnto the Lord, further note we That as the voice and tongue is one speciall instrument and meanes to glorifie God,Note. and ought so to be vsed at all times, so chiefly in singing of Psalmes. But I passe from that, and come to consider the maner of our singing in these words (with a grace in your hearts to the Lord) where first we are taught. That in singing Psalms and hymnes and spirituall songs,  our hearts must goe with our voices and tongues,In singing of Psalmes and spiritual songs our hearts must goe with our voyces. our sin∣ging must not be only with the voice, or rise only from the throat, but it must proceed from the depth of the heart, we must sing Psalmes and holy songs with vnderstanding, and with an holy feeling in our hearts, our hearts must
bee cheerefull in singing, euen possessed with heauenly ioy, and affected according to the matter that wee doe sing. And for further clearing of this, that the exhortation of Dauid Psal. 33. serues directly, where hee sayth, sing cheerefully with a loud voyce, as if he had sayd, sing not on∣ly with a loud tuned voyce, but with inward affection and cheerefulnesse of heart, and that also of the Apostle, Eph. 5.19. speaking to your selues in Psalmes, and hymnes, & spirituall songs, singing, and making melodie to the Lord, in your hearss, the word translated (making melody) signi∣fieth making musicke as with a sweet instrument, thereby plainely teaching vs that when we sing Psalms there must be as well musicke in our hearts as in our mouthes, yea the chiefest melody must be in our hearts, our hearts must haue a gracious and sweet feeling of that wee sing, and it must affect our soules with spirituall pleasure and de∣light. For why? most of the Psalmes are meditations, and therefore our hearts ought to bee exercised in them accor∣dingly, when we sing them our hearts must be full of hea∣uenly meditations meditating and thinking on the mat∣ter of them. But a more generallmore gene∣rall. reason and ground of this duety is this, it is in singing of Psalmes as it is in praying, for many times Psalmes and prayer haue the same matter, and dif∣er onely in manner of vttering Now in vocall prayer there must bee a lifting vp of the heart, together with the voyce whence it was that Hezekiah bid Isaiah lift vp his prayer to God. 2. King. 19 4. And if the heart be not lifted vp, together with the voyce, and mooued according to the matter of the prayer, surely the prayer is but lippe labour, whereof the Lord complaines, Isai. 29.13. So it ought to be in singing of Psalmes, the heart must bee stirred vp and ffected according to the matter that is sung, else is the sin∣ging but lippe labour and displeasing to God, and this
condemnes that manner of singing, commonly vsed a∣mong the Papists (namely) their singing in a strange and  vnknowen tongue,Singing in an vnknowen tongue, and that manner of singing of Psalms, wher∣in the words and sentences are broken and deuided, is not iustifi∣able. for how can the heart bee affected with, and according to the matter that is not vnderstood? it is not possible, yea, this condemnes that manner of singing Psalmes, wherein the wordes and sentences are broken and deuided, and one sillable or word is runne vpon, with so many diuisions, as the sence is darkened, and the singing onely feedes the eare with a pleasing tune, but it fits not the heart with any good affection that manner of singing, though it be of Psalmes and spiri∣tuall songs, seruing onely for the tickling and delight of the eare, cannot be iustifiable by the word of God. Againe, is it so, that in singing of Psalmes, our hearts must goe with our voyces, & our harts must haue in them a gracious feeling of that wee sing, and according to the matter bee stirred vp and affected, when we sing Psalmes, and must there be a melodie in our hearts, aswell as in our mouthes. Oh then take we notice of it, that for the most part our  singing of Psalmes, is not as it ought to bee,Our failing in in the manner of singing of Psalmes, dis∣couered. doe not wee many times, when wee are singing of Psalmes, either in priuate or publique, thinke of nothing lesse, then of the matter wee sing; are not our hearts, euen then wandering after our eyes? yea, are they not many times ranging and rouing abroad, and farre remooued from it? and how bee our hearts affected in time of our singing, to instance in some particulars. Doest thou when thou singest, I lift mine heart to thee, my God and guide most iust, Psal. 25. Doest thou then lift vp thine heart and soule to the Lord in heauen? or rather, are not thy thoughts depressed and kept downe by earthly cogitations, and thou hast not so much as a thought of that glorious Maiesty? and when thou singest out of the 19. Psalme.
That the hony and the hony-combe are not so sweet as the Law of God, art thou so affected toward the word & commandements of God? I feare mee in the most of vs, there is no such matter, we sing and sound it out that the word is most sweet and precious, but in the meane time, our hearts haue no feeling of the sweetnesse of it, is this to sing Psalmes, with a grace our hearts? no, no, such man∣ner of singing is rather gracelesse. And we must learne to reforme it, and remember thou whensoeuer thou singest a Psalme,Our hearts must be full of heauenly ioy, and affected according to the matter of our singing, when we sing Psalmes. thine heart must goe with thy mouth, and thine heart must be full of heauenly ioy, and stirred vppe and affected according to the matter thou singest, and if it be not so, surely, then thy singing is but lip-labour, and highly displeasing to God: that thou mayest therefore sing with grace in thine heart; come to that holy exercise prepared, be able to say with Dauid, Psal. 57.7. my heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared, I will sing and giue praise. And it thou aske me when thy heart is prepared. I answer, when the assurance of thy sinne pardoned, the perswasion of Gods fauour towards thee, the hatred of sin, the loue of the life to come, and the like, doe stirre thee vp to the singing of Psalmes, and looke that thine heart bee thus turned and and prepared, that thy singing may come from the inward affection of thine heart, as the chie∣fest instrument of that heauenly musicke, and know wee this, when men are not affected according to the matter that is sung,Motiues to stirre vs vp to this duty. nor haue their hearts full of heauenly ioy in singing of Psalmes, it argues plainely their hearts are not right within them. And againe, as verball praiers thorough the iust iudge∣ment of God bring men to great blockishnesse, so vocall singing, singing onely with the voice and not with the heart will in time bring an exceeding deadnesse and dul∣nesse on men, that they shall sing onely vpon custome and fashion, without any feeling at all, and therefore la∣bour
thou to prepare thine heart, and to set thy heart in tune, when thou art to sing Psalmes, that so thou mayest sing with a grace in thine heart, euen with surpassing hea∣uenly delight, and that thine heart may bee mooued and affected, according to the matter which thou singest. The next thing heere required by the Apostle in our singing Psalmes is: That it bee to the Lord, singing with a grace in your  hearts to the Lord, so then our singing of Psalmes and spi∣rituall songs must bee onely to the praise and glory of God,Our singing of Psalmes & spirituall songs must be onely to the praise and glo∣ry of God. Reasons euen with reuerence to his great and glorious Ma∣iestie, and with acknowledgement of all honour and praise to bee due to him alone, for why, singing of Psalms is a speciall part of Gods worship, and therefore may not be yeelded to any other but the Lord alone. And againe, to haue Psalmes sung to him, is a speciall part of the Lords glory, which hee will not communi∣cate to any creature, man or Angel, no, not to the humani∣ty of Christ, though that bee exalted farre aboue the An∣gels, howsoeuer indeede it is true, that wee may sing Psalmes to Christ, and call on him in prayer, yet our singing and praying to him, must bee as hee is ,Note. God and man in one person, his humanity is not to bee worshipped with religious worshippe, for it selfe, or by it selfe, because by it selfe it is a creature, but as it is personally vnited to the God-head, and as it is part of that person which is, true God, so the humanity of Christ is to bee worshipped with one and the same worshippe, that the God-head is as appeares plainely, Hebrewes the first and the sixth, it is there sayd, that the Angelles must worshippe the first begotten sonne of God, brought into the world, that is, Christ God and man, (but that by the way.) Hence it is cleare that no part of religious worshippe is to be giuen to the humanity of Christ apart and seuered from his God-head, and therefore Psalmes are not to bee
sing to his humanity alone, and if not to the humanity of Christ, then much lesse to any other creature, and it prooues it strongly that our singing of Psalmes must bee directed to the Lorde and to his praise and glorie a∣lone. And heerein are our aduersaries the Papists iustly to be taxed,The Papists taxed for sin∣ging songs of praise to the Virgin Mary. as in praying so in singing they offend, little regar∣ding to keepe within compasse of this duty, in their masse booke wee finde they haue songs of praise to the Virgin Marie, in which they blasphemously call her their media∣trix, and say she is placed in the throne with God the Fa∣ther, and that shee raignes with God, yea they sing to her that shee is the mother of grace, the fountaine of mercy, with a number of like praises that they sing to her most wickedly, and most blasphemously; for there is no meere creature either in heauen or in earth worthy to bee ioyned with God, and to haue any part of diuine worship, such as is singing of Psalmes, and spirituall songs, hee is God ouer all, and hee alone is to bee magnified and praised for euer. And for the vse of this to our selues, we must remember to whome the singing of Psalmes must be directed (name∣ly) to the Lord,Wee must re∣member to di∣rect our sin∣ging of Psalms to the praise of God. say thou with Moses, Exodus 15. I will sing vnto the Lord, who is the fountaine of all the good things I enioy, when thou hast occasion to reioyce for some blessing of God vouchsafed vnto thee, and to shew forth thy ioy by singing of Psalmes, then sing not to thy selfe, that is, in thy singing haue not respect neither looke thou to thine owne wit or paynes, as if thine owne wit or paines had beene the onely cause of that blessing, nor yet to thy friends and meanes, to thy fortune, to thy bagge or baggage, nor to any other thing, let no creature robbe God of his right, sing thou to the Lord, and direct thy singing to him alone, euen to the praise and glorie of his name alone, who alone is the author and giuer of euerie good gift.
One thing in generall may bee further gathered from these words, (In Psalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord) (namely this) it is cleare by this text. That the exercise of singing is lawful if it be both for matter and manner, as the Apostle hath heere set downe, if the matter be a Psalme, or a Hymne, or a Spirituall song, and if it bee with grace in our hearts to the praise of God, then no question of it, singing is lawfull. Hence by proportion we may gather, that playing vp∣on an instrument of musicke is also lawfull; yea, the har∣mony of many musicall instruments together, is a law∣full thing; if it be rightly vsed,Playing vpon an instrument of musicke, & the harmony of many mu∣sicall instru¦ments toge∣ther, is a law∣full thing if it be rightly v∣sed. and as it ought to bee, and that it is lawfull, the excellent vse of it makes it manifest, its of vse to stirre vp spirituall ioy and cheerefulnesse in the heart. Wee reade 2 King. 3.15. that when that great Pro∣phet Elisha saw his minde, thorow the zeale to Gods glo∣rie troubled in respect of the King of Israel, he called for a minstrel, and so by meanes of his playing his minde was refreshed, and the heat and zeale of his affection was stir∣red vp to speake the word of God And hence it is, that we vse to sing a Psalme before the Sermon,Note. it is not a mat∣ter of complement to grace the action, but to stirre vp our hearts more cheerefully to speake, and heare the word of God; and therefore, doubtlesse, musicke either in singing, or playing on instruments, being of such excellent vse, is a lawfull thing and may be vsed, if it be rightly vsed, and that wee are especially to looke vnto, that wee vse it a∣right. Some may say, how is that,  when doe wee rightly vse it? I answer,Answ. The right vse of Musicke. when we vse it to a right end, with moderation and in due season, when we vse it to stirre vp spirituall ioy, & to make vs more fit to glorifie God, and to walke in our callings, and when we vse it moderately, not making of a
recreation an occupation, not playing to play, (that is) not suffering our hearts to bee stollen away, and snared in the pleasure of our musicke, and when we vse it seasonably, not vsing it when we should be otherwise exercised, as in praier, in hearing the word, in meditating on that we haue heard. And in these respects, if we duly examine our selues, we shall finde that most of vs are faulty,Reproofe of those that a∣buse musicke. and iustly to bee re∣proued; it is (no doubt) with many of vs, as it was with the people in Amos his time, Amos 6.5. They make Da∣uid their defence for musicke abused; yea, doe not many vse musicke, not to stirre vp spirituall ioy, but to stirre vp their wanton lusts, tripping and dauncing after their mu∣sick wantonly, and immodestly; yea, and that excessiuely, euen spending whole daies and nights, and that in Ta∣uerns, and like places? Yea, doe not many thus vse it on the Sabbath day? What is more common then at our weddings on the Sabbath day, to doe as the people did, Exod. 32.6. To eat and drinke, and to rise vp and play, and then to attend to our musicke, and to dally and daunce? Yea, some thinke they may lawfully doe it when the pub∣like exercise is done, then they think they may follow their dauncing and gaming: but know thou whosoeuer thou art, that so doing, thou keepest a day, not to the Lord, but to the Deuill, and thou dost then more dishonor God and hurt thy selfe, then in any day of the weeke besides; remember it therfore, that thou maiest lawully vse musick if thou rightly vse it; if thou vse it to a right end, to stir vp spiritual ioy with moderation and in due time and season; & if thou faile in one or more of these circumstances thou dost abuse it, and shalt one day answer for the abuse of it; yea, without repentance the Lord will iudge thee, as that euill seruant, Matth. 24 49. who is there said, to eate and drinke with the drunken, its lawfull to eat and drinke, but if men eat and drinke with the drunken (that is) excessiue∣lie abusing their meate and drinke, they shall receiue an heauy doome, so if thou abuse thy musicke, which may be
lawfully vsed, without repentance for that sinne, thy por∣tion shall be with hypocrites. VER. 17. And whatsoeuer ye shall doe in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing thankes to God, euen the Father by him. In this verse the Apostle goes on to exhort the Colossians to other duties of the first Table of the commandements; as to inuocation, and calling vpon God, and to thankesgi∣uing in this exhortation, he commends to them a generall rule, reaching to all things not specified before, as if hee had said, because it were infinit to write to you of all things particularly, take this that I now set before you, as a gene∣rall rule of al your sayings, & doings whatsoeuer: here then the Apostle doth vrge on the Colossians, this generall. That whatsoeuer they did, they shold do it in the name of Christ who is described by his title Lord, & by his name (Iesus) & withall the Apostle doth specifie and expresse more parti∣cularly what hee meanes by that generall, all whatsoeuer they should do (namely) all words and all deedes whatsoe∣uer (saith he) ye shall doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus, and he there staies not, but he fur∣ther requires of them, that their sayings and doings should be with thankes to God (giuing thanks to God) and that is in∣larged, by shewing how God is to be conceiued of them in their giuing of thanks to him (namely) not only as the cre∣ator of al things, but as a father, and then by whom as their mediator they should present and offer vp their thanks to God in the last words, by him (namely) by Christ, and so the summe and substance of this verse is an exhortation. To say and do all tings whatsoeuer in the name of Christ, with thankes to God the Father, thorow him the only me∣diator betweene God and vs. The parts of this exhortation are these two. First, that whatsoeuer we shall doe in word or deed, we do it in the name of the Lord Iesus.
Secondly, whatsoeuer is done of vs, wee giue thankes to God by Christ. Come we to the first of these: And whatsoeuer yee shall doe in word or deede, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus, (that is) what businesse soeuer yee shall enterprise, what matter soeuer yee shall enter vpon, and take in hand to performe. For the word (doe is heere extended by the Apostle,Interpre∣tation. as we see, both to word and deed, and therefore wee are to con∣ceiue his meaning largely, and generally, (in word, or deede) that is, either in speech or action, (doe all) doe all those businesses and matters in the name of the Lord Iesus. It may bee said, sometimes men take in hand wicked workes, are they to doe them in the name of the Lord Iesus? Answ: The Apostles meaning is not that wee should doe wicked workes in the name of the Lord Iesus, but that wee should onely doe such things as may bee done in his name, and that the things wee take in hand, either in speach or action, be lawfull and good, such as may bee done, and then that wee doe them in the name of the Lord Iesus. (In the name of the Lord Iesus) This forme of speech hath many acceptions in Scripture, I will not stand to re∣member them. Heere it doth imply thus much, that what businesse or matter soeuer wee enterprise, wee take it in hand, with inuocation, with calling on God in the name, and mediation of Christ, and that is cleare by the words following, that we are to giue thankes to God the Father by him, (that is) in his name and mediation as appeares plainely Ephes. 5.20. Thus then conceiue wee the Apo∣stles meaning in these words. (And whatsoeuer yee shall doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus.) As if hee had said, The meaning of the text.What matter or businesse soeuer you enterprise, and take in hand, either in speach, or action, let
it bee such as you enter vpon with praier, and when you enter vpon it and take it in hand, looke that your enterprising of it bee with inuocation and calling vpon God in the name of Christ. Now first obserue we that the Apostle,Obseru. heere sets before vs a generall rule according to which, whatsoeuer matter, or businesse wee take in hand, either in speech, or action, must bee framed, that whatsoeuer wee doe in word, or deede, wee must doe it in the name of Christ, euen with calling vpon God in his name. Hence presseth this point. That all matters, businesses, and workes wee take in  hand, either in speech, or action,Euery worke and businesse wee take in hand in speech or actiō, must be such as we may present before the Lord in praier Reasons. they must bee such as wee may present and set before the Lord in praier, they must bee such as wee may craue the Lord his di∣rection, his assistance, and his blessing in, and vpon them thorow Christ, and whatsoeuer worke or businesse, wee may not commend to God in praier, that we may not say, or doe. For why? there is no matter, businesse or worke we may take in hand, but that we haue either expresse warrant for,  or at least approbation for it in the word of God, and a promise of a blessing, either direct, or by good conse∣quent to bee gathered, belonging to it; and therefore there is no matter, or businesse wee may enter vppon, but that wee may by faith, (resting on the Comman∣dement and promise of God) commend to God in praier. And againe, euen in matters of businesses of this world,  we must carrie our selues, not onely iustly, but religiously, saying and doing all we say or doe, as in the presence of al∣mighty God, as the Lord said to Abraham, Gen. 17.1. I am God al-sufficient, walke before mee, and bee thou vpright, and therefore, doubtlesse, all matters, busi∣nesses, and workes wee take in hand, either in speech,
or action, must bee such as wee may set before the eye of the Lord, and offer and present to him in praier, cra∣uing his direction in them, and his blessing vpon them in the name of Christ; it were easie to make this further manifest. But for the vse,  let it bee laid vp in our hearts, and re∣membred,When we go about any matter, or bu∣sinesse we are to consider whether wee may comend it to God in praier, or no, & according∣lie to doe it, or leaue it vn∣done. and whensoeuer thou goest about any matter, or busines, learn then thus to debate, & thus to think with thy selfe; is this thing that I goe now about such as I may commend to the Lord in praier? May this that I am a∣bout, be said, or may this be done in the name of the Lord Iesus, euen with thy calling on God in his name? Surely then, I may take it in hand with cheerfulnes and comfort; but on the other side, is this I am now about to do, such a thing, as I dare not set before the Lord in praier, nor call on him for a blessing in the name of Christ, or at least, I doubt, whether I may so doe, or no? Surely then its good for me to forbeare, and to take heede how I aduenture on it. Oh that men would thus think and reason with them∣selues, when they are about to take in hand any thing, ei∣ther in speech or action, no doubt it would bee a notable meanes to keep them from doing many things they doe amisse, would men if this were thought on and remem∣bred, would they then take vpon them by their speech to giue false euidence and testimony, against an innocent, or to make a lie for the defence of a guilty person? Would they then enter on their businesse, and take in hand workes of their callings on the Sabbath day? with many other things that might be reckoned vp: but these are to common amongst men, and therefore I instance in them, would men, I say, take in hand to doe these and many like things, if they did remember, they are to take in hand nothing, either in speech or action, but that they may doe in the name of Christ, and may commend to the Lord in praier, in, and thorow him? Surely no, if they had any
dramme of the feare of God, they would not, and therfore remember this as a rule of excellent vse to guide thee in all things, thou takest in hand, either in speech or action, that which thou maiest take in hand, either to speake, or doe; it must be such as thou maiest doe in the name of Christ, and commend to God in his name: and if the thing thou art about to speake, or doe, bee such, then goe on with boldnesse, if it be not, take heede how thou doest it; and howsoeuer it may bring thee in worldly profit, yet because thou canst not commend thy worke to the Lord in praier, thou canst not looke for a blessing on that profit, but ra∣ther, indeed, the curse of God vpon it; yea, without thy repentance and Gods great mercy towards thee, thou shalt finde the curse of God vpon that, and that beeing laid to the rest of thy goods, euen vpon all that euer thou hast, Habac. 2.9. And therefore euer remember this, that all matters and workes thou takest in hand must bee such, as thou maiest commend to God in praier, and say, the Lord for his Christ sake blesse them, and giue good successe vn∣to them. The next thing that offers it selfe to our consideration, as a duty laid before vs in this generall rule, is this. All our waies and works ought to bee enterd into with praier, when we enterprise, and take in hand any businesse, either in speech or action, wee must call on God in the name of Christ, for a blessing vpon it. Looke on the example of Abrahams seruant, Gen. 24.12.  He praied that the Lord would send him good speed,All our waies and works are to be taken in hand with praier. and haue mercy on his master Abraham. And Ruth 2.4. Boaz praied for his reapers, for that salutation of his (the Lord be with you) was, no doubt, a lifting vp of his heart with his voice, that the Lord would strengthen and blesse their labours. And Act. 20.36. We find that Paul before hee tooke shipping, kneeled downe and praied. And by these examples and many more that might be brought to this purpose, wee are plainely taught.
That wee are to take in hand the labours and workes of our callings with praier, if oportunity serue not to make a set praier at the beginning af euery worke, yet at least, euen in the worke we are to lift vp our hearts to the Lord, when wee are labouring and sweering, and in the middest of our greatest imploiment. And the reasons of this are manifest. First, without the blessing of God all our labours are vaine. Psalm. 127.1.2. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it, and it is in vaine to rise earely, and to lie downe late, and to eat the bread of sor∣row. Therefore we are to call vpon God for a blessing vpon them. Againe, by praier our labours are sanctified, howsoeuer they may be lawful worke and warranted by the word, and so good in their kind, and in themselues, yet to vs they are not sanctified without praier. That which the Apostle saith of the creatures, 1 Tim. 4.5. is also true of the workes of our lawfull callings, they are sanctified by the word and praier. First, therefore, this serues to checke and reproue such  as labour in their callings,Reproofe of such as care not to sancti∣fie their la∣bours by praier. and are very sedulous and pain∣full in their worke, they toile, and moile but they haue no care to sanctifie their labours, and to call on God for a blessing vpon them. Doe not many of vs rise earely, and so soone as euer they are vp, they fall to their worke, and continue at it till they are wearie, and then lie downe, ne∣uer calling on God before, nor giuing thankes after? Is this a labour in our callings pleasing to God? No, no, if thou so thinke thou art deceiued, thou must know that la∣bour and toile, though it be in a lawfull calling is not sim∣ply good, and a thing wherein God is pleased (for wicked men may doe it) but labour sanctified is the labour that the Lord liketh, and will blesse; and withall remember that thou labouring and working, and yet hauing no care
to call on God for a blessing on thy labours, thou labou∣rest not in the name of the Lord Iesus. Thou wilt say, in whose name then? Surely in thine own name, euen in confidence of thine owne strength, and thou art one of those Iames speakes of chapter the 4.13. that say, to day wee will doe such or such a thing, such a peece of businesse we will dispatch this day, but neuer lift vp their hearts to the Lord, desiring him to inable them to doe it, and so doing, it is a bolde presumption in thee, and one time or other, cannot e∣scape the punishing hand of God, and therefore take heed of it, and euer remember that thou must enter on thy la∣bours with prayer, at least euery morning call thou to God for a blessing on all thy labours that day, and in the heat of thy worke, when thou art most earnest about it, still now and then lift vp thine heart in prayer. Againe, is it so, that when wee take in hand the ordi∣nary workes of our callings, wee are to call vpon God in  the name of Iesus Christ for a blessing, then doubtlesse much more ought wee so to doe, when wee enter on the holy duties of Gods worshippe,If we may not enter on the workes of or∣dinary cal∣lings, without prayer in them, much lesse on the duties of Gods wor∣ship. as to heare the worde, to receiue the Sacraments, and the like: and heerein the most of vs are much faulty and iustly to bee blamed, doe not most men and women, either come from their beddes or from some ordinary businesse to the Church, neuer caring to call vpon God for a blessing on that holy busi∣nesse. Well, let vs know that so doing, though the workes of hearing the worde, receiuing the Sacraments, bee holy in themselues, yet they are not sanctified vnto vs, and howsoeuer wee renounce the opinion of the Papists, tou∣ching opus operatum, yet indeede wee doe as they doe, wee rest in the worke done, yea, wee comming to the Church without calling vpon God before wee come, we come not in the name of God, but in our own names, and can we then look for a blessing? Surely no, but rather for
a curse, and that our hearing of the word should turne to our deeper condemnation, and therefore especially re∣member when thou commest to do the work of the Lord in his immediate worship and seruice, that then thou call on God in the name of Christ for a blessing, that it aboue all other things may be sanctified vnto thee. Now the Apostle saith (whatsoeuer ye doe) and then addes (in word or deed) it is cleere. That euen speech is sometimes a work, as the speech of the Magistrate, or of the Minister. And therefore no light matter as some esteeme it, but vpon that I will not stand, neither will I enter to speake of the poynt of mediation in whose name wee are to pray till we come to the last wordes of this verse (by him) only one thing we are to mark that the Apostle sayth not (by the name of Christ) though by his name many great workes may bee done, but in the name of the Lord Iesus, no doubt hee thus spake vpon purpose to teach vs thus much. That wee must bee able to doe all our workes in the name of Christ with comfort, and so as they may bee in his mediation accepted,We must bee able to doe all our workes in the name of Christ with comfort, and so as they may be in his me∣diation accep∣ted. for indeed men may do great workes by the name of Christ, and yet finde no comfort in the doing of them, they may by his name prophesie, and cast out diuels, and doe many great workes, Matth. the seauenth and twenty two, and yet finde no comfort, nay they may (notwithstanding these great workes) goe to hell. Therefore if wee woulde finde comfort in our labors wee must doe them in the mediation of Christ, and so as wee are sure they are accepted in and thorow him. How is that may some say? When wee haue part in the merit of Christ by faith, then our labours and all the good things wee doe are ac∣cepted in him, and there is comfort in the doing of them: whereas otherwise, if wee haue no part in the me∣rit
of Christ, the best words wee doe or can doe,  though it bee the winning of soules, haue no comfort in them, they may bring comfort and good to others, but neuer will they bring comfort to our owne soules, therefore la∣bour thou to haue part in the merit of Christ,We must la∣bour to haue part in the merit of Christ, that our workes may be ac∣cepted in and thorow him. and neuer rest till by faith thou doest apprehend his merit, and ap∣ply it to thy selfe, and then thy workes and good thinges thou doest will bee pleasing to God, and in and thorow the mediation of Christ, thou shalt finde comfort in the doing of them. Come wee to the second part of the Apostles exhorta∣tion heere vrged, namely this, that whatsoeuer is done of vs, either in word or deede, wee giue thankes to God by Christ (giuing thanks to God euen the father by him) giuing thankes to God, that is, with ioy and gladnesse of heart, magnifying and praising God, with a true and serious acknowledgement of his goodnesse and mercy,Interpreta∣tion. opening your mouthes to render thankes and praise to him (euen the father) in the originall it is (and the father) the coniun∣ction (and) doth not heere note diuersity of person, but is put to declare how God is to bee conceiued of vs in our giuing thankes vnto him, namely, as our father in Christ his sonne, in whom hee hath loued vs, and made vs accep∣ted in his sight, Ephes. 1.6. and of his fathers loue to∣wards vs in him, hath bestowed on vs, that for which wee giue thankes, and many other benefits (by him) that is by Christ, as your mediatour and in his name, Ephes. 5.20. this then is the meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had sayd more largely thus.
With ioy and gladnesse of heart, and with a seri∣ous acknowledgement of the goodnesse of God,The meaning of the text. opening your mouths to magnifie and to render thankes to him as to your good and gratious Fa∣ther in Christ, offering vppe your praise and thankesgiuing by Christ, as your Mediatour e∣uen in his name, and thorow him alone. Now first heere wee may plainely see this duty layd before vs. That as wee are to enter on our workes and businesses, and to begin what matter soeuer we take in hand, either in speech or action with prayer, so wee are to end the same with thankes-giuing,As we are to beginne our works and bu∣sinesses with prayer, so wee must end them with thankesgiuing. it is not enough for vs to come to to God before our worke, crauing his direction and bles∣sing in and vpon the same, but we must come to him after it is ended with thankesgiuing, hauing then our hearts en∣larged, and our mouthes filled with praise and thankes∣giuing to him. And for this also wee haue example in the Scripture, Gen. 24. Abrahams seruant not onely prayed before his iourney verse the twelfth, but verse the twenty seuen, hee gaue thankes to the Lord, for that hee had giuen him good successe in his iourney, and hee sayd, blessed bee the Lord God of my Master Abraham, which hath not withdrawen his mercy, and his truth from my master, 2. Chron. 20. wee haue a notable example to this purpose we there finde that when a a great army came against Ie∣hoshaphat and his people, and they were to goe out and to meet them, and to fight against them, that good King & the people, not only humbled themselues before they went out, and Iehoshaphat made an excellent prayer, from verse the sixth, to the end of the twelfth, but also
afterwards when the Lorde had giuen them a maruel∣lous victorie ouer their enemies, then they blessed the Lord, and gaue thankes to him for the same, verse 26. they assembled themselues in the valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the Lord, saith the text, and verse 28 they came againe to Ierusalem with viols and with harpes, and with trumpet euen vnto the house of the Lord; and to these might be added other examples teaching vs the same thing, that wee are not onely to enter vpon our workes, and beginne them with prayer, but that wee must also end them with thankesgiuing to God, with cheerefulnes of heart, opening our mouthes to magnifie the name of the Lorde, for the same the reasons of this duetie are these. First, because God is the principall agent in euerie  good worke and businesse done by vs, wee are but as tooles and instruments in his hand, and therefore of of right, praise and thankes belongs to him for the doing of it. And againe, because thankesgiuing must euer reach as  farre as petition, what wee make petition and request for at the hand of the Lorde; the same wee are to giue thankes for: so hath the Apostle taught vs, Philippi∣ans 4. verse 6. In all things let your requests bee shew∣ed vnto God in praier and supplication, with giuing of thankes, hee extends the one as farre as the other, and therefore as wee beginne our worke and businesse with prayer, so wee must ende it with thankesgiuing, alwaies praising God for his mercy and blessing, in and vpon the same. Obiection. Happily some may say,  but what if the Lorde crosse vs in our lawfull workes begunne in the name of Christ, and taken in hand with prayer, and we haue not good successe in our busines, are wee then to blesse God and to giue him thanks? I answer, we are euen then to giue thankes to the Lord,
for howsoeuer the successe answer not our desire and ex∣pectation, and so in seeming, and in our conceit is not good, yet if we be in Christ, certainly it is good, and for the best to vs: The Lord sees it would not be good for vs to prosper in that businesse, and hee in his wise prouidence will so dispose it as it shal be to our good according to that Romanes 8.28. All things worke together for the best vn∣to them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpose, and the Lord doth sometimes crosse vs in some good businesse and with prayer taken in hand, to humble vs for something wherein we haue failed and not done as we ought, as happily wee haue not prayed with feruency of spirit, as wee ought, but coldly or customari∣ly, or the like, and therfore howsoeuer the successe of our labours taken in hand with prayer bee not answerable to our desire and expectation, yet notwithstanding that, wee are to blesse God for it, and still it remaines our duety, that what worke or businesse soeuer wee take in hand, ei∣ther in speech or action with praier, wee are likewise at the end of the same, to open our mouthes in praise and thankesgiuing to God, wee must not onely doe all our workes in the name of Christ, but wee must doe them also with giuing thankes to God in his name. Now in this duty most of vs are farre short and much  wanting. Especially if the Lord crosse vs neuer so little in any businesse wee take in hand,Many faile in this duty espe∣cially if the Lord crosse them but a lit∣tle in any bu∣sinesse they take in hand. if things wee take in hand, succeede not according to our desire, what shall wee then heare from many of vs, giuing thankes to God? Nay ra∣ther, muttering and murmuring, yea, sometimes cur∣sing and banning, and wishing a plague or a mischiefe to light on the thing or person by whose meanes wee are crossed, this is too common amongest vs, now what is this but to bee displeased with the worke of Gods proui∣dence, and indeede to mumure against God himselfe, thy duty is to beginne thy businesse with prayer, and how∣soeuer
it succeede, though contrarie to thy desire, yet to blesse God, and with ioy and gladnesse of heart to giue him thankes, and remember if thou belong to Christ, thou hast reason so to doe, for then thou beeing crossed, the Lord sees it good, thou shouldest be so, and hee will dispose it to thy good. Oh but this is hard to flesh and bloud? It is true: But thou hast more in thee then flesh and bloud, euen the Spirit and grace, else is that crosse a curse vnto thee; but to go on in the application of this duty, if we duly ex∣amine our selues, and call our selues to a strict account, I feare mee, the most of vs will bee wanting in this duety of thankfulnesse, euen then when our labours succeed well, and we prosper in them according to our desire, where is almost the man or the woman to be found that giues true thankes to God for the same? Happily wee doe it for forme or fashion in some few wordes, as I praise God for my good successe this day in my businesse, but where is our thankesgiuing to God with a serious meditation and due acknowledgement of his goodnesse and mercy? where is that affection of Dauid, opening the mouth wide in magnifying the name of God, as Dauid did, 1. Chronicles the twenty nine? reade the place from the first verse to the end of the thirteenth, verse the eleuenth hee sayth, Thine oh Lord is greatnesse and power, and glorie. and victorie, and praise, for all that is in the hea∣uen, and in the earth is thine, thine is the kingdome, Oh Lord, and thou excellest as head ouer all, &c. See, hee could not finde wordes sufficient to set out the affection of his heart, where is this manner of thankesgiuing to bee found? Surely it is rare and hard, to be found amongst men in these daies; well, to stirre vs vp to helpe forward in this duty, I might vrge the excellency of it, being a peculiar exercise of the Angels in heauen.
But consider wee onely these two things. First, if wee haue not our mouthes opened aswell in hearty thankesgiuing to God after our labours (howsoe∣uer the successe be) as before to call on him for a blessing vpon them.We are to pra∣ctise the duty of thankesgi∣uing to God, after our la∣bours and workes. Motiues to stir vs vp vnto it. Surely, it argues our hearts are not sound within vs, for an hypocrite may desire and pray for a good thing, and pray for it from the bottome of his heart, and yet haue no good and godly desire, but a desire of selfe-loue, but hee can neuer giue true and hearty thanks to God for any blessing receiued,Note. he may fumble out out some wordes of thankesgiuing, but he can neuer truely and heartily praise God. And if wee then haue not our mouthes filled with hearty thankes-giuing vnto God, after that our la∣bours are ended, it is an euident argument our hearts are but hollow, and there is no soundnesse of grace in them. And againe: Consider that thankes and praise is neuer truely gi∣uen to God for any mercy or blessing, but thorowe Gods mercy it brings downe another mercy, and a further blessing. Looke on the example of the leper, Luke the seauen∣teenth, hee returning and giuing thankes to Christ for his clensing, had also his sinnes forgiuen, as wee may ga∣ther by those words verse 19. Goe thy way, thy faith hath made the whole. If then wee would make it cleere, to the comfort of our owne hearts, that our hearts are not hollow, but that there is soundnesse of grace in them, and if wee would haue mercie after mercie, and one blessing after another, thorow Gods mercy descending downe vpon vs; let vs then bee stirred vp, not onely to come to God in prayer, when we take in hand our workes and businesses, but also
to come to him after with our hearts enlarged, and our mouthes opened, and full of true praise and thankesgiuing to God. The next thing that offers it selfe to our consideration, is from these wordes (euen the Father.) Whence we are taught thus much. That our giuing thankes to God must be to him, as to  our gracious father in Christ,Our thanks∣giuing to God must bee to him, as to our gracious fa∣ther in Christ. when the Lord hath vouch∣safed to vs any good thing, or blessing, we must be able to giue him thankes for it, as for a blessing, comming to vs from his fatherly loue in Christ, as a blessing comming to vs in, and thorow his Sonne Christ Iesus, wee must bee a∣ble to vse the Apostles forme of praise and thankesgiuing, Esphesians 1.3. Blessed bee God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath blessed vs with all spiritu∣all blessing: in heauenly things in Christ with Spiri∣tuall, yea with this or that temporall blessiing in Christ Iesus. Men commonly thinke it enough, if they can say, I thank the Lord, he hath giuen me such and such a good thing, though they be not able to say, such and such good things in Christ. Now there is no comfort in such thankesgiuing, the very heathen might goe so farre. Wee must bee able to giue thankes to God for bles∣sings vouchsafed to vs,  as comming to vs from God our gracious Father in Christ,We must la∣bour to know and be assured that God is our father in Christ, that wee so giue him thankes for good things vouch∣safed vnto vs. A motiue thereunto. as tokens and pledges of his loue, in the Sonne of his loue Christ IESVS; and this wee shall neuer doe, till wee know that God is our Father in Christ, and wee haue his Spirit bea∣ring witnesse with our Spirits, that wee are his chil∣dren; and therefore wee are neuer to rest till wee come to that knowledge, and that assurance; to giue thankes to GOD the Father of our Lord IESVS Christ, for any blessing, or good thing vouchsafed to
vs onely as a blessing and good thing in it selfe, and not to vs in Christ, is so farre from being comfortable, as indeed, it doth rather bring in discomfort; it giues thee to vnder∣stand that, that good thing is giuen, to leaue thee without excuse, and for further increase of thy condemnation, and therefore neuer rest till thou be able to blesse God, and to giue him thankes for good things vouchsafed to thee from his good and gracious hand, in, and thorow Christ. The last thing remaines, which this verse doth offer to our consideration, touching the point of mediation, in whose name we are to come to God in praier, and thanks∣giuing,Wee are to come to God in praier and thankesgiuing onely in the name and me∣diation of Christ. and that is cleare by this text, that in Christ his Sonne alone wee are to pray and giue thankes vnto God, wee must doe all things in the name of Christ, and giue thankes to God by him, I will further proue this by some reasons. First, he alone must be our mediator and intercessor be∣tweene God and vs, who is able to take away sinnes that hinders vs from comming to God, but Christ only is able to doe that, Heb. 7.25. Hee is able perfectly to saue them that come vnto God by him, seeing he euer liueth to make intercession for them; and hence it is that redemption and mediation are ioined together, 1 Tim. 2.5.6. Therefore Christ onely is our Mediator, and in his name alone must we pray, and giue thankes to God. Secondly, he in whose name wee must pray and giue thankes to God, must be able not onely to remooue sinne, death, and all punishment from vs, but to procure righte∣ousnesse, life and fauour the of God towards vs, for we are taught to come to God, as to a Father, and not a Iudge, and to say, our Father, but Christ onely doth this, Gal. 4.5. therefore he alone must be our Mediator. Thirdly, we are commanded in the word of God, to pray in the name of Christ, Iohn 16.24 and no where in the name of any other. Therefore in his name alone must
we pray, and giue thankes to God. Fourthly, hee must bee our Mediator in whose name  wee haue promise to bee heard, but in Christ onely wee haue this promise. Iohn 14.13.14. If yee shall aske any thing in my name, I will doe it. 2 Cor. 1.20. In him all the promises of God are yea, and Amen, (that is) are con∣firmed, and fulfilled; therefore in his name alone must we come to God in praier and thankesgiuing. Happily some will obiect, that which wee finde,  Rom. 8.26. The Spirit it selfe helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray as we ought, but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes which cannot be expressed. I haue heeretofore answered this (but in a word to re∣member it) the Apostles meaning is,  that the Spirit doth breath into our hearts such motions, whereby wee call on God earnestly with sighes that cannot be expressed, for so it followeth; and therefore, notwithstanding this, it re∣maines a truth, that in Christ his name alone wee are to pray, and giue thankes to God. And this we are to hold against our aduersaries,  the Pa∣pists, who set vp other Mediators betweene God and vs, as Angels and Saints;Confutation of the media∣tion of An∣gels, & Saints held by the Papists. yea, they haue found out a newe distinction for this point, that forsooth, Christ is the Me∣diator of redemption, but the Saints of Intercession; wherein they robbe Christ of a great part of his honour belonging to his Priesthood; for Christ hath not onely by his one sufficient sacrifice, of himselfe consecrated them that are sanctified, Heb. 10.14. but also sits at the right hand of his Father, to make request for them. Rom. 8.34. Christ his Priesthood is euerlasting. Heb. 7.24. There∣fore his intercession is perpetuall. The Papists alledge some places of Scripture to proue their mediation of Angels and Saints,  but they are either Propheticall visions, or Hypotheticall sentences, senten∣ces conditionall, as that, Ier. 15.1. Though Moses and Sa∣muel stood before me, yet mine affection could not bee
toward this people (that is) if Moses, Samuel, and the like, I will not stand to remember them, onely that which they bring to proue that we may plead our owne worthy∣nesse in praier, and desire to be heard for our owne good works I wil briefly answer, to this purpose they alledge the example of Dauid, Psalm. 86.2. Preserue thou my soule for I am mercifull: Oh God, saue thy seruant that trusteth in thee. And of Hezekiah 2. King. 20.3. I beseech thee O Lord, remember now, how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and haue done that which is good in thy sight. Heereupon they conclude that we may pray to God in consideration of our owne good workes. I answer them, Dauid and Hezekiah in the places cited, did not pleade the merit of their righteousnesse,  but one∣lie testifie that they were the children of God regenerate, and such men to whom God had promised to bee good and gracious, they did onely assure themselues that Gods promise of helpe and deliuerance belonged to them in particular, because they were of that number spoken of, Psalm. 34.15. And thus farre we may vse the benefit of good conscience, and our owne integritie (namely) to confirme vs in the promises of God made to his children, but wee must euer remember to come to God in praier,Note. and thankesgiuing, in the name and merit of Christ a∣lone. Now to the 18. Verse.
VER. 17. Wiues submit yourselues vnto your husbands, as it is comelie in the Lord. The Apostle hauing absolued the first part of this Chapter containing an exhortation to all Christians, ge∣nerally as they are Christians and professors of the Gos∣pel, from the first verse hitherto in this 18. verse. Hee enters on the second part of it, and hee con∣tinues that to the 2. verse of the 4. Chapter,The second part of this Chapter. and this part is a comprehension of certaine speciall duties of Chri∣stians they stand in relation one to another in some par∣ticular state, or condition of life; it containes speciall exhortations addressed to certaine sorts of persons,The Apostles order in this part of the Chapter. and particularly, and (namely) to all the ordinarie parts of a familie, both inferiours, and superiours. And therein the Apostle holds this order. First, hee exhorts to the duties of those that are more  neerely and straitly tyed one to another, as to the duties of husbands, and wiues, parents, and children. And then to the duties of those who are lesse straitly ti∣ed  one to another, as masters, and seruants: and thorow∣out he begins with the duty of inferiours, as wiues, chil∣dren, seruants, and then comes to the duties of superiors, husbands, parents, and masters. Heere therefore, first the Apostle begins with the duty of wiues, and saith, Wiues submit your selues vnto your hus∣bands as it is comely in the Lord. And in this verse we haue these things in generall laid before vs. First, an exhortatiō to wiues, to submit themselus to their husbands and that generally, or indefinitely propounded. Secondly, an argument to backe and strengthen that  exhortation, taken from the decorum, comelinesse, and decencie of it, that it is a comely and decent thing for them so to doe. And then,
Thirdly, the manner of their subiection, or a limitation of that dutie of their subiection, that it must bee in the Lord, in the last words, in the Lord. (Submit your selues) The word properly signifieth, be ordered,Interpre∣tation. or placed in order vnder another, the meaning is according to your inferiour order and place, subiect your selues, it is the same word with that, Rom. 13.1. (To your husbands) the words are to your owne husbands, as it is comely, or as it is meet, and as it beseemes you (in the Lord) the meaning of that forme of speech, is thus much, so farre foorth as it may stand with the true feare of God, and with your obedience to his will, so as you may still hold piety, and good conscience towards God, as wee may gather by the same phrase, 1 Cor. 7.39. Or thus, in things lawfull, and agreeable to the will of the Lord. Thus then, conceiue wee the exhortation of the Apo∣stle, as if he had said, Wiues according to your inferiour order and place,The meaning of the text. subiect your selues to your owne Husbands suffer your selues to be ordered by them, as it is meet, and beseemes you, so farre foorth as may stand with the true feare of God, and obedience to his will in things lawfull, and agreeable to the will of God. Come we now to the matter of the doctrine; and first obserue we,Obseru. that the Apostle hauing exhorted to generall duties that concerne all Christians, as they are Christi∣ans; he there staies not, but comes now to exhort to spe∣ciall duties, that concerne certaine sorts of persons parti∣cularly; hee comes to exhort to the duties that concerne Christians in their personall estates, and conditions of life. Hence we are taught thus much. That it is not enough for a Christian to carry him∣selfe
well, and as a Christian in the generall duties of a Christian, but hee must also behaue himselfe Christianly in the speciall duties of his speciall calling.A Christian must not only carrie him∣selfe well in the generall duties of Chri∣stianity, but also in the spe∣ciall duties of his speciall calling. Its not suffici∣ent for a Christian to be of good conuersation abroad, but his behauiour must be also good and such as it ought to be at home. And hence it is that the holy Ghost directs his exhorta∣tion to seuerall sorts of persons (especially in the family) to carrie themselues holily and iustly, not onely heere, but in other places of Scripture, as Ephes. 5. & 6. 1 Pet. 2. and 3. Tit. 2. And the reasons of this are manifest, First, euery Christian hauing two callings: one general  to be a Christian, and the other speciall, as to bee an hus∣band, a wife, a father, &c. and both these of God, it be∣hooues him that he carry himselfe well, both in the one, and in the other, if he will approue himselfe to God. And againe, euery Christian besides his gene∣rall  standing, in which hee is to withstand the com∣mon enemy, and to set himselfe against temptati∣ons to sinne common to him with others, hee hath his peculiar place and standing appointed him by the Lord, in which he is to bend his force, and to striue against temp¦tations to sinne proper to that place, such temptations as are laid against him in that his peculiar place and calling, and it is meet that he shew himselfe faithfull in them both, that both in his generall and peculiar calling, he withstand temptations to sinne, and therefore a Christian must not onely carrie himselfe well in the generall duties of a Chri∣stian, but he must also demeane himselfe as a Christian in the duties of his particular state and condition of life. They therefore are iustly to bee blamed and reprooued  who happily make a faire shew of good conuersation in their generall calling,Reproofe of those who carrie them∣selues well in shew in their generall cal∣ling, and yet faile in the duties of their speciall cal∣ling. and yet carrie themselues badly in their speciall, they who would faine seeme to bee good Christians abroad, and yet behaue themselues wretched∣lie
at home, too many such there be in the world. For ex∣ample, look vpon a people assembled to heare the word of God, and you shall see, there is almost no man or woman amongst them but they carrie themselues reuerently, all, and euery one almost is a like reuerent and attentiue in hearing the word, and euery one almost, seemes to make conscience of that generall dutie in the Church, but goe home with many of them to their houses, and looke into their conuersation at home, and there you shall easily see they make no conscience of their speciall duties, of duties that concerne them in their particular state and conditi∣on of life, there you shall see either the wife refusing to subiect her selfe to her husband, or the husband bitter to his wife, the children stubborne and disobedient to their parents, or the parents too indulgent, or too rigorous to∣wards their children; seruants refractarie and carelesse in their duties, or masters vniust and vnequall in their dea∣lings toward their seruants; yea, in some houses you shal see all parts out of order, both husband, wife, and all the rest, neglecting the duties of their particular place and standing. And againe, are there not some who carry themselues in Christian duties, which they owe to men; well, and without exception towards most men abroad in publike, but towards them, to whom they stand in some speciall relation, wretchedly, and wickedly? As the wife carries her selfe well, and in some tolerable sort towards all, saue to her husband, and the husband demeanes himselfe well, and giues some content to all saue his wife, and so in other relations. Now consider we this, is this to carrie our selues as Christians ought to doe? No, no, this is but the forme of godlinesse without the power of it, as the apostle calles it, 2 Tim. 3.5. this is but meere hypocrisie; is it like thou behauest thy selfe well (for conscience sake) towards them to whom thou owest but a generall duty, and not to those
to those to whom besides the generall thou art tied with a speciall bond? no, no, it is but for thy credit, or thy pro∣fit, thou disguisest thy selfe abroad; for such a one thou art indeede, as thou art at home, there is the principall proofe and triall of thee what thou art, and euer remem∣ber this; it is not enough for a Christian to carry him∣selfe in generall dueties as a Christian, but hee must al∣so carry himselfe well in the speciall dueties of his parti∣cular place and calling, and the practise of the one with∣out the other is but hypocrisie, and it is worth our mar∣king, that the holy Ghost doth heere single out the due∣ties and conditions of men and women seuerally, and hee speakes to wiues apart, and to husbands apart &c. there∣by to leaue vs without all excuse: if wee bee not confor∣mable euen in our particular dueties in this or that state or condition of life, for that which is spoken to al (such is our corruption) wee commonly put it off, as if it were spo∣ken to none, but this wee cannot so passe ouer; no, no, not so much as with any colourable excuse, that may satisfie our owne sinfull corruption and ill iudging con∣science. Obserue further that the Apostle in setting downe the speciall duties of seuerall sorts of persons, hee begins first with the inferiours, as first hee teacheth the duety of wiues and then of Husbands &c. and this order hee obserues in other places, heereby teaching vs. That when wee are to deale with persons of seue∣rall  estates and conditions and to informe them in their duties, wee are rather to beginne with the inferiours then with the superiours,When we are to inform per∣sons of seue∣rall conditiōs in their duties we are rather to begin with the inferiours then the supe∣periours. as when wee are to make peace betweene the inferiour and superiour, as ser∣uants and Masters: wee are first to beginne with the infe∣riour, the seruant shewing him his fault, and letting him see his duetie, and then in the second place with the su∣periour for so much the fifth commaundement tea∣cheth vs.
The Lord doth there directly teach the inferiour his duty, and the superiour by implication, but on that I will not further stand. Come wee to the speciall duety heere vrged, namely, the duty of wiues, that they bee subiect to their hus∣bands, in handling this duety, I will obserue this order keeping as neere as can bee,The order obserued in handling the duty of wiues which is the third doctrin. within compasse of the Apo∣stles words. First, I will shew what this subiection is. Secondly, wherein it doth consist. Thirdly, the generalitie of it, touching the persons whom it concernes. Fourthly, how farre foorth it is to bee yeelded, and then after some particular examination touching the practise of this duty, I will vse some motiues to stirre vppe them whom it concernes to the perfourmance of it. What the wiues subie∣ction is.First therefore know we, that this subiection is an hum∣ble, a ready and willing minde in the wife, yeelding to the gouernment of her husband, as to the ordinance of God; for indeede so hath the Lord ordained, that the wife should bee subiect to her husband, Gen. 3.16. thy desire shall be to thine husband, and this subiection must be of an humble and ready minde, our present text makes it cleare, in that the Apostle sayth, wiues submit your selues which is as much as if hee had sayd, bee not constrained, to it, but of a ready minde, of your owne accord, euen willingly subiect your selues to the gouernement of your husbands, acknowledging the ordinance of God, and resting in it, and this also is taught, Ephes. 5.22. where the Apostle sayth, wiues submit your selues vnto your husbands, as vnto the Lord, that is, not as to man, and to the eye outward, or by constraint, but sincerely, and from your hearts as to the Lord himselfe, the hus∣band being in Gods stead, and verse 24. in that hee saith, wiues are to bee in subiection to their husbands as the
Church is to Christ, he plainely teacheth that their subie∣ction must bee of a ready and willing minde for the Church, the true spouse of Christ is subiect to Christ wil∣lingly, sincerely, and from the heart. Now this humble, ready, and willing subiection of the wife to her husband, doth consist in two things, namely, in reuerence, and in obedience,The subie∣ction of rhe wife to her husband is in two things, in reuerence and obedience. the wiues subiection to her husband, must bee in a reuerent awe of her husband, & in obedience to him, we find it so branched out in the word of God, Eph. 5.33. saith the Apostle, let the wife see that she feare her husband (that is) she must carry in her minde a reuerent opinion of her husband, & in her heart a reuerent awe and feare to offend him, acknowledge him as her head, and so her feare towards her husband must not be a slauish feare but a feare of loue such as is from the bodie to the head, and from the Church to Christ, euen of a louing affection fearing to of∣fend her husband in any thing, and shewing foorth that, her inward louing feare, by outward meeknesse and lowli∣nesse in her speech, countenance, and all her behauiour towards him. And againe, her subiection to her husband must bee in obedience to him, doing what hee giues in charge to bee done, and forbearing to doe that hee forbiddes, wee find that both these were in Sara towards Abraham, her hus∣band, 1. Pet. 3.6. Sara obeyed Abraham, and called him Sir, the Apostle propounds her example to bee follow∣ed of all Christian wiues, they are to carrie in their hearts a reuerent aw of their husbands, shewing it forth in al meek∣nesse of speech and gesture, and they are to yeeld obedi∣ence to them in word and deed. Now the extent of the wiues subiection,The duty of subiection in the wife to her husband rea∣cheth to all wiues whatso∣euer they be. the third thing that I propounded to speake of, is implied in the first words of this verse (Wiues) in that the Apostle speakes generally and indefinitely, and saith, wiues subiect your selues to your husbands, hee giues vs to vnderstand. That this duty of subiection is generall and common,
and reacheth to all wiues, high or low, rich or poore, no∣ble or base, and there is no exemption of any wife what∣soeuer she be, from this duty of subiection to her husband, though the wife bee very wise, and more fit to gouerne, and the husband of meaner parts and weaker iudgement, if hee haue any vse of reason at all, if hee bee not a man franticke or madde, one altogether bereft of the vse of reason; if hee be so, then doubtlesse the wife is not bound to subiect her selfe to his gouernement, but rather to take on her to bee his guide and his gouernour, for the power of gouernment beeing taken away, subiection depending on it, ceaseth; but if hee haue the vse of reason, bee it but in a small measure, shee is not exempt from subiection, though shee bee neuer so wise, if shee bee a wife, shee must bee subiect, shee must yeeld reuerence and obedience to her husband, vnlesse shee will shake off the yoke the Lord hath layd on her necke, and breake in sunder the cords of Gods holy ordinance. Concerning the fourth thing, namely, how far foorth subiection is to be yeelded by the wife to her husband,How farre foorth subie∣ction is to bee yeelded by the wife to her husband. e∣specially in that branch of it namely, obedience, it is laid before vs in the last words of this ver. (in the Lord) cōsidred together with the last words of Eph. 5.24. so let wiues be to their husbands in euery thing that generall is heere li∣mited, & we are to vnderstand that these words put toge-thus, that the wife is to bee subiect and obedient to her husband in euery thing in the Lord (that is) in euerie thing honest and lawfull, in euery thing commanded by the husband, not contrary or different from the word of God, the wife is to yeelde obedience, but if husbands command their wiues vnlawful things, therin they are not to bee subiect nor obedient to them; Luke the fourteenth and twenty six, hee that loueth father or mother, or wife, or children; and so of the husband, she that loues her hus∣band more then Christ, and in obeying her husband dis¦obeyes Christ, is not his disciple, but if the husband com∣mand
his Wife any indifferent or lawfull thing shee is to yeeld obedience without gainesaying, though it bee neuer so crosse and contrary to her owne minde; as if her husband say to her, I will not haue thee thus or thus attired, but thus or thus (not commanding any new fangled or who∣rish attire, but such as is comely) shee is to conforme her selfe to his mind, and if he bid further, goe to such a place, whether she may lawfully go, (being not to a play-house or the like) though she haue no minde to goe, or if he bid her tarry at home when she hath a minde to bee abroade, if she cannot perswade him to the contrary: in these things she is to obey him, for indeede in these things the com∣maundements of the husband hath Gods stampe set on them, and if in these things and such like things the wife disobey, shee rebels against God himselfe. Now if wiues do examine themselues by this that hath beene saide,  I feare mee most wiues will bee found farre short, and much wanting in their duety towards their husbands, to come a little to the triall, dost thou willing∣ly, sincerely, and from thy heart yeeld due reuerence to thy husband?Particular ex∣amination of wiues tou∣ching their duty towards their husbāds, and their fai∣lings therein discouered. Dost thou carry in thine heart a louing awe and feare towards him as to thy head and gouernour, set ouer thee by the Lord, fearing to offend him in any thing eyther by speech or gesture? I feare mee if most wiues an∣swer these questions truely, their answer must be negatiue, and they must needs confesse they doe not. The vnreue∣rent behauiour of many wiues towards their husbands is too palpable, are there not some who care not to shew themselues in the sight of all that looke on them so farre from yeelding reuerence to their husbands, as they sticke not to scoffe and scorne them, to tush and puffe at them, and to cut them vp short in words? yea some there bee who care not to breake out into grosse termes and bitter words against their husbands, yea, which is most fearefull sometimes to curse their husbands, whom they should re∣uerence and feare.
My husband is a froward frampell man, and he alwaies begins with me. Bee it so, that is his fault, yet that is no excuse for thee, thou art to beare his frowardnesse as thy crosse with patience, and not thereby to be driuen from thine owne dutie. Now for the second branch of subiection (obedience) are there not many wiues as much wanting in that as in the former? surely yes, it is too euident. Some there be, who sticke not to vtter it, that they will doe this or that, yea sometimes they binde it with an oath, they will doe it, let their husbands say what they can to the contrary, or they will not doe that hee would haue them (being a thing lawfull) though hee would neuer so faine; to insist in one particular, are there not some wiues, who if their husbands bid them leaue of this or that apparell, as too fine or costly in the matter, or too garish in the manner, will presently answer him they will not? yea, some are so shamelesse, as to answer in this manner, let him say or doe what hee can, I will haue it so, thus, and many wayes besides, wiues discouer the rebellion of their hearts, in vnreuerent and vndutifull behauiour towards their husbands, yea, they are hardly drawen to this duety of subiection, it is an hard matter to perswade them to it, because the wife is yoke-fellow with her husband, and neerely knit to him, euen one flesh with him, and there∣fore many wiues thinke it vnreasonable, and too much laid on them, in that they are inioined to be subiect to their husbands.Foure mo∣tiues to per∣swade wiues to performe their duty to their hus∣bands. Now then to perswade with them to yeeld to this duty, let them consider onely these things. First, such wiues as refuse to subiect themselues to their husbands, inuert the order of nature, it is as if the bodie should refuse to be guided by the head. Secondly, they breake the ordinance of God, yea, a most ancient ordinance of God, for euen in mans inno∣cency,
before the fall was, woman by Gods ordinance sub∣iect to her husband with pleasure, and if thou bee not nowe subiect to thine husband, thou breakest the cords of Gods ordinance, and pretend what thou wilt, that thou art subiect to other superiours and gouernours, in∣deede and truth there is no such thing in thee, but an in∣tolerable pride, swelling against all superiority as occasion serues, for how canst thou stoop vnder other yokes, and yet wilt not bow downe thy necke to this, of all other the most ancient and the most easie. Thirdly, consider the Apostles wordes in this place, that it is a comely thing for the wife to bee subiect to her husband, and the want of this or the contrary to it, is an vncomely and vnseemely thing, seest thou a woman not subiect to her husband? shee is an vncomely and loath∣some creature in the sight of God, though her face be ne∣uer so faire, her beauty is but as a ring of gold in a swines snout, Prou. 11.22. Last of all, the want of subiection in the wife to her hus∣band, is as the want of teaching in a Minister, and the want of iustice in a Magistrate, it is a blot and blemish to all her other good qualities and vertues bee they neuer so excellent, admit shee bee descreete, chaste, sober, &c. yet if shee bee not subiect to her husband, shee causeth the worde of God to bee ill spoken of, Tit. 2.5. and that makes all her other good qualities nothing woorth, it brings a blot on them all, seeme shee neuer so religious, if shee bee not subiect to her husband, shee hath but a shew of religion without the power of it. Let all Christian wiues thinke on these things, it is not so light a matter as many women thinke, to bee vnreue∣rent and vndutifull towardes their husbands, thereby they preuert the order of nature, they vioiate the ordi∣nance of God, they make themselues odious in the sight of God, they blemish all the good things that are in them, yea, thereby they make it plaine, that their religion is but a
shew without substance, it will neuer yeeld them sound comfort, bee thou therefore thou wife (whosoeuer thou art) stirred vp in the feare of God, to yeeld subiection to thy husband, lay aside all reasonings of the flesh to the contrary, labor thou to subdue al thy rebellious thoughts, and neuer rest till thou bee able with a willing minde, to shew thy selfe reuerent towards thine husband, and obe∣dient to him in all lawfull things, and remember who it is that requires this duty, at thine hands, euen the Lord, who hath made thee of nothing, redeemed thee (if thou belong to him) with the bloud of his owne deare Sonne, and preserued thee from thy birth, giuing thee foode, rayment, and all good things, and let these mooue thee to become obedient to his voyce, and hee saying to thee, wife submit thy selfe to thine husband, let thine heart answer him, I am content to doe thy will O Lord, yea, thy Law is within mine heart to doe it, and then doubtlesse thou shalt he a woman much set by before God, 1. Pet. 3.4. and many blessings shall come on thee, and ouertake thee. VER. 19. Husbands loue your wiues, and bee not bitter vnto them. In this verse the Apostle sets before vs the duty of hus∣bands towards their wiues, namely this, that husbands ought to loue their wiues, which is set downe by way of exhortation, and that indefinitely, husbands whatso∣euer yee bee, loue your wiues, and this exhortation is further amplified by a disswasion from the contrarie, that husbands should not bee vnlouing or vnkinde to their wiues, which is expressed vnder a comparison, the Apostle comparing the vnkindnesse of the hus∣band towardes his wife, to bitter things, he saith, be not
bitter vnto them (Husbands loue your wiues) that is, carry in your hearts a kind and louing affection towards them, and shew it foorth both in word and deed,Interpreta∣tion. (and be not bit∣ter vnto them) that is, be not to your wiues as bitter things are to the taste, be not vnpleasant and harsh in your beha∣uiour towards them, vse no hard and rigorous dealing to your wiues, either in word or deed, take heede your loue turne not into gall and bitternesse towards them. Now first, let it be heere obserued of vs that our Apo∣stle hauing taught wiues in the former verse, to submit themselues to their husbands, and now comming in this verse to speake to husbands, hee speakes not to them as it may seeme, hee ought to haue spoken; for hauing said, Wiues submit your selues to your husbands, it may seeme hee should heere haue saide, as most answerable and cor∣respondent to his former speech, Husbands rule ouer your wiues, and exercise your authoritie ouer them; for rule and subiection are correlatiues and correspondent one to another, not subiection and loue; yet the Apostle thus speakes not, but hee being guided by the Spirit of God speakes thus; Husbands loue your wiues, and bee not bitter vnto them. Hee thought it more fitte to teach hus∣bands their duty, then to put them in minde of their po∣wer, and to let them vnderstand how to vse their power o∣uer their wiues well, and as they ought, then to stirre them vp to the exercise of it, hee knowing husbands ready e∣nough to vse their power and authority ouer their wiues, thought it more meete to informe them how to vse it aright, and in holy manner, then to stirre them vp  to the vse of it. Heereby plainely teaching vs thus much. That husbands are especially to looke that they vse their power and authoritie ouer their wiues well, and in a right manner,Husbands are especially to bee carefull to vse their power & au∣thority ouer teir wiues well and in a right manner. they are to bee most carefull for this, that the rule and gouernement of their wiues put into their handes, bee vsed as it ought to bee;
its lawfull indeed, for husbands to rule and gouerne their wiues put in subiection vnto them, but the practise of that rule and gouernement must bee seasoned with loue and sweetnesse. And hence it is that howsoeuer by implication, its cleare from many places of Scripture, that the husband hath power and authority giuen him ouer his wife, and he may vse it; yet, we neuer finde it directly said, husbands rule ouer your wiues, or husbands exercise authority ouer your wiues, but we finde it often said, husbands loue your wiues, and giue honour to them as to the weaker vessels; thereby teaching, and vrging the manner of husbands rule and gouernment, and therefore husbands are especially to looke to that, and the reason of it is manifest, (name∣lie) this. It is the hardest thing that can bee, for a man to carry himselfe wel, and as he ought, in any place of eminency, or in any degree of preferment and superiority, such is the corruption of our nature, that if a man bee aduanced and preferred aboue others, in any place or degree, his heart is commonly lift vp in him, and exalted aboue measure, and he cannot vse his preferment, but with tyranny and do∣mineering ouer such as are vnder him: let a man bee pre∣ferd, and set in any place of gouernment, though but o∣uer his owne wife, his owne children, his owne seruants, yea but ouer bruit beasts, as to be but a sheepe keeper, and without the sanctifyng grace of Gods Spirit, he will dis¦couer the bitternesse of his heart, hee will exercise rigour and tyranny ouer them; and therefore husbands are especially to looke to this, that their preferrement and superiority ouer their wiues, be rightly vsed, they are to labour to haue their harts sanctified by the spirit of Christ, that they may vse the power and authority ouer their wiues, that is put into their hands, in holy manner as it ought to be vsed. And this serues to reproue such husbands as vse rigour
and tyranny in the rule and gouernment of their wiues;Reprofe of such husbands as vse rigour and tyranny in the gouern∣ment of their wiues. happily some may take occasion thorow their owne cor∣ruption, vpon that doctrine, touching the subiection of wiues, to play the tyrants ouer their wiues, and because wiues are to subiect themselues to their husbands, and are to yeeld them reuerence and obedience; heereupon they may happily thinke, that they may tyrannize ouer their wiues, and carry themselues as Lions in their owne hou∣ses: but let them know, whosoeuer they bee, that thinke they may so doe, they discouer their owne weakenesse, and their want of right vnderstanding and iudgement, and they sauour the doctrine of the Apostle to death, and not to life. And now learne, whosoeuer thou art, that howsoeuer thy wife is to subiect her selfe to thy rule and gouernement, yet thou maist not thereupon take occasion to domineere and tyrannize ouer her; no, no, thou must especially looke to this, that thy superiority and dominion ouer thy wife be rightly vsed, laborur thou to haue thine heart sanctified in thy preferrement aboue thy wife, that it may be vsed in holy manner, euen in loue, and that it may be void of all rigour and bitternesse, and if it bee not so v∣sed, assuredly, without repentance, that preferrement of thine shall one day stand in iudgement against thee, and shall arggauate and increase thy condemnation. I come to the duty it selfe heere vrged by the Apostle,The order obserued in handling the duty of hus∣bands, which is the second doct. (namely) this, that husbands are to loue their wiues. Touching this duty, I will shew. 1 First, what this loue that ought to bee in the hus∣band is. 2 Secondly, wherein it consisteth. 3 Thirdly, the extent of it touching the persons. 4 And fourthly, the measure and condition of it. And then after these things laid a little nearer to our selues, I will vse some motiues to stirre vp to the practise of this dutie. First, therefore know wee, that this loue is, a chaste
affection in the heart of the husband,What the loue of the husbād to his wife is. whereby hee is so v∣nited and knit to his wife, as hee doth rest contented with her, and speakes her good by all good meanes, without subiection, in, and for the Lord; I say, a chaste affection; to distinguish it from vnchast loue, and wanton lust; for the loue of the husband to his wife must be, as the loue of Christ to his Church, Ephes. 5 25. And Christ his loue to his Church is most chaste; that which is added, that this loue doth so vnite the husband to his wife, as hee doth rest contented with her, and seekes her good by all good meanes; wee shall shew that, in expressing wherein it consisteth, but that this must be without subie∣ction its cleare, in that the husband is the wiues head, E∣phes. 5.23. and that it must bee in the Lord, and for the Lord, (that is) so as may stand with the feare of God in o∣bedience to his particular Commandement, binding eue∣rie man to loue his wife in speciall manner, wee cannot doubt of that. The loue of the husband to his wife stands in loue to her body and loue to her soule.I come therefore to the second thing, (namely) to shew wherein this loue consisteth: and forth at there be two es∣sentiall parts of the wife, her body, and her soule, the hus∣bands loue consists in them both, and for the husbands loue to the body of his wife, that consists in two things, in contentation and preseruation. The husband must content himselfe with the loue of his owne wife onely: we finde that particularly com∣manded, Prou. 5.18.19. Let thy fountaine be blessed, and re∣ioice with the wife of thy youth. Verse 19. Let her bee as the lo∣uing Hinde, and pleasant Roe, let her breasts satisfie thee at all times, and delight in her loue continually. And secondly, the husband must preferre the bodie of his wife, by cheerishing, gouerning, and defending of her, and these three are so conioined, and linked one within another, as they are not to bee sundered; for to cheerish and not to gouerne, is foolish cockering; to gouerne, and not to cheerish, is austerity; to cheerish, and gouerne, and
not to defend, is to make the wife no better then a slaue, nay, worse then a bruit beast, for men will cheerish, order, and they will also defend, and shelter their sheepe, and oxen, from iniurie of weather, and shall then any of these things be denied to the wife? No, no, men are to nourish and cherish their wiues, as their owne flesh, Ephes. 5.29. They must (as they are able) prouide meate, drinke, ap∣parell, and all things needfull for them, and prouision be∣ing made, they must so order and dispose all things, as there be no excesse in any thing, and they must also shield them, as much as they can, from all iniurie and wrong, both at home, and abroad. Now, for the husbands loue to the soule of his wife that stands especially in two things. The first is, that which we are taught, 1 Pet. 3.7. That he dwell with his wife as a man of knowledge: the husband being the wiues head ought to be more eminent, and to appeare aboue her in wisdome, iudgement, and discretion, and the feare of God, and according to his height and measure in those good things, to bend downe, and to apply him∣selfe, either to implant the same, or to increase them, being already implanted in his wife. Husbands sometimes complaine that their wiues are vnruly, and carrie not themselues as they ought towards them, when indeed, the fault is from themselues, because they should dwell with them, as men of wisdome, and knowledge, and doe not; its as if the head which hath the guiding of the body, should leade it thorow briers, and thornes, and cause it to bee scratched, and then complaine that the armes, or legges, did ake, or smart; for the husband is the wiues head, and should wisely lead her, and goe in and out before her. The second thing wherein stands the husbands loue to the soule of his wife is comprised vnder a generall duty, Philip. 2.2. the husband is to carrie an equall minde to∣wards his wife, and that is, especially in bearing with her
frailties and infirmities, as with her hastinesse, or slownesse, her importunity, and such like; The Apostle Peter in the place before cited, saith, Let the husband giue honour vnto the woman as vnto the weaker vessell; let him in∣treat her with mildnesse, and gentlenesse, bearing with her naturall weakenesse and infimities, and if shee fall by oc∣casion into any fault (except Adulterie, which is the bane of wedlocke) let him labour by all kinde and gentle meanes, to reclaime her, considering himselfe, as the Apo∣stle saith, Gal. 6.1. that he also may bee tempted, and fall into the like sinne. The dutie of loue in the husband to the wife rea∣cheth to all husbands.For the third thing, the extent of this duty touching the persons whom it concernes, that is implied in the first words of this verse (Husbands.) In that the Apostle saith indefinitely, Husbands loue your wiues, not bounding the duty on husbands of this or that order, or condition; he would haue vs vnderstand that this duty is also generall, and reacheth to all husbands, hie and low, rich and poore, none excepted, though the husband bee a King, or the greatest man in the earth, if hee bee an husband hee must carrie in his heart a chaste affection toward his wife, hee must loue both her body and soule, content himselfe with her loue onely, cheerish, gouerne, and defend her, dwell with her as a man of knowledge, and beare with her na∣turall frailties, and infirmities. The husband must loue his wife as much as himselfe, & with as hearty and true loue as he loues himselfe.Now for the measure of the husbands loue, the fourth thing I propounded to speake of, that is taught by the Apostle, Ephes. 5.33. Let euery one loue his wife, euen as him∣selfe: the husband must loue his wife as much as him∣selfe, and with as hearty and true loue, as hee doth him∣selfe, hee need not seeke farre for a patterne of the loue he is to beare to his wife, or a fit example for his imitati∣on; let him but looke into his owne heart, and there hee shall find loue to himselfe drawne out in liuely red letters, euen in his owne blood, and that is the patterne accor-to which hee must proportion his loue to his wife; the
husband must consider what good, he in his heart wish∣eth to his owne bodie and soule, and what harme hee la∣boureth to auoide, and the same good must hee heartilie wish to the soule and body of his wife, and the same harme must he labour to keepe from her; as it is abomina∣ble to haue two measures in one shop, one to buie, with a greater, and another, to sell withall, and that a lesse, Prou. 20.10. So is it for a man to haue two measures of loue in his breast, one a greater, by which hee loues himselfe, and another a lesse, by which he loues his wife, there must bee the same true measure and condition of loue, in the heart of the husband, both towards himselfe, and towards his wife. Now to lay these things a little neerer to our selues,  if husbands try and examine themselues by these things deliuered, where is the man that can cleare himselfe, and truely say, hee hath not failed in his dutie towards his wife?Particular ex∣amination of husbands touching their dutie to their wiues, and their failings in that respect discouered. No doubt, euen they that make conscience of their duty, and endeauour most of all to performe it, must needs confesse, that in some thing or other they haue failed, but not to speake of them that faile of infirmity, and against their purpose; are there not some who haue, and daily doe faile grossely, and please themselues in their sinfull failing and declining from their dutie towards their wiues? The number of such is too great in the world. Are there not some who carry in their hearts not only a wanton and brutish lust towards their wiues, which continues but for a time, and afterwards turnes as Ammons loue did, 2. Sam. 13.15. into extreame hatred. Are not some, who content not themselues with the loue of their owne wiues, but fol∣low after strange flesh, and delight to embrace the bosome of a stranger? Is it not too manifest that there bee some husbands so farre from cheerishing their wiues, and proui∣ding things needfull for them, as whatsoeuer they get, they spend in vaine, and vnthrifty company, in the Ale-house, or the like place, and let wife and children starue at home.
And alas, how many husbands bee there, that dwell not with their wiues as men of knowledge, are not able to go∣uerne their wiues with any good discretion, but are foo∣lish heads, and cannot goe wisely in and out before them? How many, againe, be there, that cannot beare with the frailties of their wiues, but if the wife bee hasty, the hus∣band is as hot; if shee be rash, he is as heady, and intem∣perate? And many other waies doe husbands faile in their duties towards their wiues. Well, husbands must be hum∣led for their failings past, and learne now to make consci∣ence of their duty; carry in thine heart a chaste affecti∣on towards thy wife, content thy selfe with her loue, cheerish, gouerne, and defend her, as much as thou art a∣ble,3. Motiues to perswade husbands to performe their duty to their wiues. dwell with her as a man of knowledge, beare with her naturall fraileties, and infirmities, and let thy loue bee as much, and as hearty towards thy wife, as towards thy selfe. And to helpe thee forward in this duty, consider, First, that thy wife is thine owne selfe, Mat. 19.5. and in louing her, thou louest thy selfe, Ephes. 2.25. And secondly, consider that as the Lord would haue the neare vnion of Christ and his Church set before vs in the coniunction of man and wife in marriage; so hee would haue the loue of Christ to his Church, to bee repre∣sented in the loue of the husband to his wife; and there∣fore if the husband loue not his wife, it is, as much as in him is, to denie that Christ loues his Church, and the thought of that is blasphemous. And further, consider that thy wife is committed to thee in trust, by her parents and friends; yea, shee hath committed her selfe to thee, as a partner with thee, in weale and woe; yea, the Lord hath committed her to thee in trust, for her good, and hath giuen thee power to gouerne her, and thou must one day, stand before him to giue an account how thou hast carried thy selfe towards her.
If then thou beare any loue to thy selfe, if thou wouldest not (as much as in thee is) denie that Christ loues his Church, and so shew that Christ his loue hath not yet warmed thine heart, and if thou wouldest not be found vnfaithfull to the Lord, who hath committed thy wife to thee for her good, and is able and will (without repentance) punish thy breach of trust in hell fire, then be thou stirred vp in the feare of God to loue thy wife as thy selfe, looke what good thou doest wish in thine heart to thy selfe, wish the same to thy wife, dwell with her as a man of knowledge; frame thy selfe to beare with her naturall infirmities, and knowe withall thus much, that loue in the husband and feare in the wife, are the sinewes of a well ordered house, and they make a sweet hamonie, if loue and feare harbour vnder one roofe and lodge in one bed, they make a blessed consent, and good agreement, and if loue bee wanting in the husband, bitternesse is the wiues portion, as the Apostle heere saith, and if feare bee wanting in the wife, it were better for the husband to dwell in a corner of the house toppe, then with such a woman in a wide house, Prou. 21.19. therefore let both husband and wife make conscience of their duties one to another. There is one thing further to bee obserued in this verse. We may obserue, that the Apostle makes loue in the husband to his wife, and vnkind, hard, & rigorous dealing with her, opposite and contrary one to another, yea, as  contrarie as sweet and bitter, he saith, husbands loue your wiues,Vnkinde and hard dealing with the wife, either in word or deed, can∣not stand with that loue that ought to be in the husband to his wife. and be not bitter vnto them. Whence it is cleare, that vnkinde and hard dealing with the wife, either in word or deede, cannot stand with that loue the Holy Ghost heere requires of husbands, bitternesse and sweetenesse can neuer meete together in one and the same subiect, no more can hard dealing and loue bee found in one and the same husband, if
the husband bee rigorus and bitter to his wife, hee is voyd of that loue and sweetnesse that ought to be in him, and therefore it cannot bee,  that there is any dramme of true loue to the wife in that husband, who is violent and monstrous in his dealing with her, who doth beate and bunch his wife,Reproofe of such husbands as are violent in their dea∣ling with their wiues, and doe beate and bunch them. and with extreame violence mis-vse her, that manner of dealing cannot stand with loue to the wife, the husband that so deales with his wife is a monster amongst men, and fitter to liue in Bedlem then in a ciuill society: for indeede it is the part of a madde man to strike his owne flesh, as hee doth who strikes his owne wife. Oh but say some, what if the wife be extreamely out of order, and no other meanes will breake her stout sto∣macke and bring her into order? I answer  thee: Hast thou vsed all other good meanes, seruing to that purpose? hast thou admonished her, sharpely reprooued her, as Iob did his wife, Iob 2 10. yet so as thy admonition and reprofe hath been without bitternes and passion, and with a mercifull heart towards her, and so as shee might perceiue thou soughtest her good, and not to ease thy selfe on her? hast thou so done? commonly this obiecti∣on comes from men that neuer vse any other good meanes, but onely in their violent passion of anger (which is a madnesse for the time) or in their drunken fit strike their wiues vpon the least occasion, yea, sometimes without any occsion at all, but bee it so, thou hast vsed all other meanes, yet thou mayst iustly doubt, whether stri∣king of thy wife, be a lawfull & good meanes or no, thou findest no expresse warrant for it in the booke of God, as thou doest for smiting thy childe with the rodde, Pro∣uerbs 23.14. and in many other places, and for buffetting of thy seruant, 1. Peter 2.20. but for striking of thy wifeNo warrant in Scripture for striking of the wife. thou hast no such expresse warrant in the word of God, but grant this, that a man may strike his wife, as hee may
cut and launce his owne flesh in the time of some great extreamity, when no other meanes will serue, hee hath a sore on his arme or legge, that of necessity must bee cut and launced, and a man in this case may cut or launce his owne flesh, yet bee thou as hardly drawen to strike thy wife, as a man in that ease would bee to cut or launce his owne flesh, euen in the greatest extremity will a man hardly bee drawen to cut or launce his owne flesh, not one amongst ten thousand can finde in his heart to doe it himselfe, and with his owne hand, hee will hardly suffer another to doe it, it will grinde and greeue him to suffer it to bee done by another, bee thou as hardly drawen to strike thy wife, nay rather forbeare to doe it▪ because thou canst not finde that as a meanes sanctified of God, to worke any good vpon thy wife; and let all husbands that are bitter to their wiues in this kinde, and in their passion do strike them, know, that they beare no true loue to their wiues, they are monsters amongst men, yea, they are o∣dious in the sight both of God and men. VER. 20. Children obey your Parents in all things for that is well-pleasing to the Lord. The Apostle doth heere vrge vpon children, their spe∣ciall duty towards their Parents, and that is obedience, he exhorts them to it, propounding his exhortation indefi∣nitely, in these words, (Children obey your Parents) then he sets downe how farre foorth they are to obey them, (namely) in all things, and hee doth further strengthen and presse his exhortation by force of argument, taken from
the Lords good liking of childrens obedience to their Pa∣rents, that such obedience is pleasing, yea, exceeding acceptable, and highlie well pleasing vnto the Lorde, these are the generall things contained in this same verse. Come wee to the wordes of it, (Children) the word children in Scripture hath many acceptions, I will not stand to remember them, heere it signifies, such as are children by naturall generation,Interpre∣tation. begotten and borne of naturall Parents, and by (Parents) wee are heere to vn∣derstand Parents by nature, Parents in respect of naturall procreation (obey) the originall worde heere vsed doth properly signifie to listen or hearken to another, as the in∣feriour doth to the superiour, the meaning is, to bend downe your eares, and encline your hearts, and yeelde vnto, & obey the sayings and doings of your Parents, that concerne you, euen that which they say or doe to you (in all things) wee are to expound these words, by those Eph. 6.1. children obey your Parents in the Lord, and so the meaning is in all things honest, lawfull and agreeable to the word of God (for that is wel pleasing to the Lord (that is) such obedience is exceeding well pleasing, and in high degree acceptable vnto the Lord, thus then conceiue wee the Apostles meaning in this verse, as if hee had said. You that are children by naturall generation bend downe both inwardlie and outwardly to yeeld obedience to that which is saide or done to you by your naturall Parents, and yeelde to them intire obedience, obey them in all things honest and lawfull, for such obedience is exceeding honest and pleasing to the Lord.
Now first of all, the speciall duty heere vrged vpon chil∣dren  comes to bee considered, and touching that duty,The speciall duty of chil∣dren to their Parents, is o∣bedience. I will still holde my former methode and order in hand∣ling of it. First, I will shewe what this obedience heere requi∣red is. Secondly, wherein it consisteth.The order obserued in handling this duty. Thirdly, the extent touching the persons that are to yeeld it. Fourthlie, how farre foorth it is to bee yeelded by children to their Parents, and then after some application of things deliuered, I will bring some motiues to stirre vp children to the practise of it.Childrens o∣bedience to their Parents described. First therefore knowe that this obedience is a volunta∣ry and heartie yeelding (so farre foorth as children are a∣ble) to the voyce and willes of their Parents, a yeelding from the heart willingly (as they are able) to that which is said by Parents to children, and by Parents, willed to bee done or suffered of their children. I say a voluntary and hearty yeelding, for that is the condition of all true sound and sincere obedience both to God and man, and so it ought to bee qualified, if it be forced, it is no true obedi∣ence, it is then but as the obedience of Deuils and repro∣bates, who, will they, nill they, are subiect to the will of God, yea both doe and suffer what the diuine prouidence hath appointed, and if it be a yeelding with grudging, mur∣muring, or the least repining, it is no sound obedience, and therefore childrens obedience to their parents must be a voluntary and hearty yeelding (as they are able) to that which is said and willed by them to be done or suffe∣red of their children. Now this willing and hearty yeelding of children vn∣to the voice and will of their parents, standeth in two things.Childrens o∣bedience to their Parents, stands in two things. First in a cheerful yeelding to that which parents teach, counsell, & command, though the things commanded be
neuer so base or painefull Prou. 1.8. My sonne saith Sa∣lomon, heare thy fathers instruction, and forsake not thy mothers teaching, and that children are to yeelde to the commandements of their parents, it is cleere from the generall, that euery soule is to bee subiect vnto the high∣er powers, Romans the thirteenth and first, parents haue their authority from God, and as they are parents they beare Gods image, and their commandements, not con∣trarying the word of God, carry the print of Gods com∣mandements. Secondly, the yeelding of children to their Parents stands in a quiet and patient suffering of that which Pa∣rents inflict and lay vppon them in worde or deede, bee it admonition, reproofe or correction, yea, though the correction bee with iust cause, or more excessiue then it ought to bee, Prouerbs the thirteenth and first, A wise sonne will obey the instruction of his father, but a scorner will heare no rebuke, Prouerbs 15.5. A foole despiseth his fathers instruction, but hee that regardeth correcti∣on is prudent, Hebrewes the twelfth and ninth, wee haue had the fathers of our bodies which corrected vs, and wee gaue them reuerence. And againe, Parents are bound, yea, it is a duty lying on them to rebuke and correct the children offending, and therefore it is a duty of children to submit themselues to their rebukes and chasticements: that is one part of their obedience. Now the extent of obedience to Parents, touching the persons that are to yeelde it, is implied in the first worde (children) the Apostle speaking heere also without limi∣tation, not saying children that are yoong, children that are vnmarried,All children without ex∣eption are to yeeld obedi∣ence to their Parents. or that liue in their fathers house, or yee sonnes or yee daughters, but yee children, indefinitely, hee giue vs to vnderstand that this duty of obedience to Parents, belongs to all children whatsoeuer, and it is nei∣ther age, nor place, nor condition that exempteth sonnes
or daughters, from yeelding obedience to their Pa∣rents. Heere therfore by the way are the Papists iustly to be taxed as the Pharisies were,Popish do∣ctrine touch∣ing childrens wiues directly contrary to Gods word. Mat. 15.6. they make the cō∣mandements of God of no authority touching childrens obedience to their Parents, by their owne inuention, for they hold and teach that in case of vowing, a Mayd once out of her nonage, that is (say they) at twelue yeeres old or aboue, may vowe her selfe a Nunne; and a yoong man out of his nonage, likewise (say they) at fourteene yeeres or aboue may vowe himselfe a Monke with con∣sent of Parents, yea, directly contrary to the expresse will and commandement of Parents, this is a diuellish do∣ctrine, and directly contrary to the expresse comman∣dement of God; a childe, sonne or daughter, is not ex∣empt from obedienee to Parents at anie age, and wee finde it directly sayd, numbers 30.6. that the father may make voyd the vow of his child, thogh pertaining to Gods worship, much more a vow made without warrant of the word of God, nothing at all pertaining to his worship, but rather irreligious and tending to the dishonour of God. Yet heere two questions are to be resolued. First, whether the son being a Magistrate, and the fa∣ther none, or inferiour vnto him, ought to obey his father. Answer:  in things that concerne not that place, the son ought to obey his father. And againe: In things that may further him in the execution of his office, the sonne is also to obey his father, thus did Mo∣ses, Exodus the eighteenth and twenty foure verse, the text saith, hee obeyed the voice of his father in Law, and did all that hee said, but if the father councell or com∣mand any thing against that place and office, then the son is not to obey him.
A second question is this, whether a good childe is to obey a wicked father. Answer, a good childe is to obey a wicked father as hee is a father, not as hee is a wicked man and commandes wicked things, for a difference is to bee made betweene the office and calling of a father, and the person that bears that office, and a good childe is to obey his wicked father, as he beares the office of a father, for so hee beares the i∣mage of God, but not as a wicked person commanding wicked things. Now the fourth thing propounded to bee spoken of, namely, how farre foorth obedience is to be yeelded by children to their parents.How farre foorth chil∣dren are to obey their Parents. That is layd before vs in these wordes (in all things) vn∣derstanding them as before they were expounded, name∣ly) in all things honest and lawfull, and agreeable to the word of God, children are so farre foorth to obey their earthly Parents, as may stand with their obedience to God their heauenly father, if parents would pull their children from God, from his trueth or from their obedi∣ence to him, children are then to shake off naturall affe∣ction, and as one saith well, they are to reserue to the Fa∣ther of Spirits, holinesse and freedome of soule, but if Parents command their children things lawfull or indif∣ferent, therein they are (as they are able) to yeeld obe∣dience, though the things commanded bee most paine∣full Philip. 2.8. the Apostle sayth, Christ was obedient to his father to the death, yea, to the most painefull and ig∣nominious death of the crosse. Now heere also comes a question to bee answered, it may bee demanded, whether a childe that is marriagea∣ble, if the father command him or her to marrie, is to obey him? Parents indeed haue power to dispose their children in
marriage, and they are not to marry without their con∣sent; and the Father commanding the childe to marry, the child is to obey two things concurring with the com∣mandement of the Father. First if the child be willing. Secondly, if the Father command the child only thus farre (namely) to marry with a person thus, or thus well quallified, as with one of honest life and conuersation with one of sound religion, as Isaac commanded Iacob, Gen 28 1.2. and not with this, or that particular person, the child hauing no minde there to match, if these two thing meet with the commandement of the Father, then doubtlesse, the child is to obey his commandement. Now if children trie themselues by the thing deliue¦red,  alas how far short and defectiue shall they find them∣selues in duty towards their parents?Childrens failings in their dutie to their parents, discouered. Where is the child to be found, that yeelds to that which is said, or done by his parents willingly? Doe not many children doe that which they are bidden, with a backward looke, with mur∣muring, whispering, and much repining? Doe not some except against it, as too base, or to painfull? And are there not many children who cleaue to their owne will and wis∣dome and thinke they knowe well enough how to carry themselues, and so despise the counsell of their parents, especially in matters of marriage, & calling, and things of greatest moment? Where is the child that doth quietly and patiently beare the rebukes and chastisements of his pa∣rents? Doe not many children in that respect, euen oppose against their parents, and resist them, especially if they be growne to any strength and yeeres? Yea, some thinke that when they are growne to yeeres, when in∣deed, they ought to bee most obedient, that then they ought not to bee so much as once rebuked by their parents for any fault, then carnall reason teacheth them to say, they are fooles that will digest reproofes and checkes, and suffer themselues to bee censured, yea
they shall haue others to put it into their heades, that they are now past children, will you bee thus vsed? Will you beare this? Why, you are now 21. yeeres old, you are past a childe, and heereupon many children take heart to themselues to be stubborne, and disobedient to their parents, and many waies besides these, doe children shew themselues vndutifull, and disobedient to their parents. Well, thou art a child, examine thy selfe by that which hath beene deliuered, and finding thy selfe wanting in o∣bedience to thy parents,3 motiues to stirre vp chil∣dren to yeeld obeidience to their parents bee humbled for it, and now knowing thy dutie, learne to make conscience of it. And that thou maiest bee stird vp so to doe, consider these three things. First, nature it selfe teacheth vs, that our parents hauing taken, and happily still taking so great paines, and cares for vs, and hauing shewed, and still shewing so great loue to vs, should haue this recompence in all honest and law∣full things to be obeied, and if thou yeelde not obedience vnto them, thou goest against the Law and light of nature, and canst thou then perswade thy selfe thou standest in grace? That thou hast grace or standest in the fauour of God? Wilt thou say, thou standest in the state of grace, and yet wilt not doe that which nature requires of thee? If thou doe, thou deceiuest thy selfe. Againe, disobedience to parents is highly displeasing, to God, we find an heauy iudgement threatned against it, Prou. 30.17. The eye that mocketh his Father, and despiseth the instruction of his Mother, let the rauens of the valley picke it out, and the young Eagles eat it. The meaning is, let such a one come to some vntimely death, and let his body be cast out vnburied, and bee deuoured and eaten vp of the beasts of the field, and the foules of the aire; yea, disobe∣dience to Parents seales vp the fearefull wrath, and heauy displeasure of God. 1 Sam. 2.25. The text saith, Notwith∣standing they obeyed not the voice of their Father, be∣cause the Lord would slay them, the Lord was angrie
with the Sonnes of Ely for their wickednesse, and was pur∣posed to slay them, and in his iust iudgement hee made their disobedience to their Father a punishment of their former sins, and meanes to bring downe his heauy wrath vpon them. And last of all, consider the Apostles argument, obe∣dience  to parents is well-pleasing to the Lord, in obeying thy parents thou shalt doe a thing not onely pleasing to thy parents, but greatly liked and accepted of the Lord himselfe, and his approbation is better then the approba∣tion of all the world; thy obedience to thy Parents shall be as a comely ornament, Prou. 1.9. it will grace and beau∣tifie thine heart and life, in such sort, as thou shalt seeme a∣miable both to God and men; if then thou wouldest not make it cleare to the discomfort of thine owne soule, that thou art not yet in the state of grace; if thou wouldest not seale it vp that the Lord is highly displeased with thee, and hath a purpose to destroy thee; and if on the con∣trary thou wouldest doe that which is exceeding pleasing to the Lord, then be thou stird vp, of what age or sexe so∣euer thou art, to yeeld obedience to thy parents in all ho∣nest and lawfull things; euen willingly yeeld thou to that which they say, or doe to thee, and quietly and patiently submit thy selfe to their rebukes, admonitions and cha∣sticements. Hauing thus seene the speciall dutie heere vrged vppon children, let vs proceede to some other things that yet remaine to bee obserued in this verse, and in the next place, its not to bee passed by without obseruation, that the Apostle saith not, children obey your Fathers on∣lie, or children obey your Mothers alone, but hee vseth a word common to both, and saith, obey your parents, as  if he had said, obey both him that hath begotten you, and her that hath borne you. We see then that obedience is required of children to both their parents, children are to yeeld obedience,Children are to yeeld obe∣dience both to father and mother. both
to Father and Mother, the first Commandement expres∣lie saith, honour thy Father and thy Mother. And Prou. 10.1. expresse mention is made of the Mother aswell as of the Father, A wise Sonne maketh a glad Father, but a foo∣lish Sonne is an heauinesse to his Mother. So againe, Prou. 15.20. A wise sonne reioiceth the Father, but a foolish man despi∣seth his mother. We find it expressely commanded by the Lord, that children should feare both Father and Mother, Leuit. 19.3. Yea, there the Mother is put before the Fa∣ther: Yee shall feare euery man his mother and his father, saith the Lord. Touching the practise of this duty, wee haue an example without all exception, euen of Christ himselfe, Luke 2.51. Its there said, He came downe from Ierusalem to Nazaret, and was subiect, or obedient to his Father and mother. Now this serues to discouer the wickednesse and sinne of such children as pretend to yeelde, and happily doe yeeld obedience to their Fathers, and yet notwithstan∣ding, make small account of their Mothers,The wicked∣nesse of chil∣dren who yeld obediēce to their Fa∣thers, but lightly regard their mothers, discouered. and lightly regard their commandements, or their chastisements, in word or deed; this is the fault of many gracelesse children and of sonnes especially; and especially, when they be∣ginne to grow to yeeres, then they seeing and noting the mothers infirmities, the weakenesse of their sexe, and how vnable they are to punish them for their disobedience, and their inferiour authority in the familie, and chiefely in this, that they haue little or nothing to doe in disposing of lands or goods, they easily grow to some contempt, or at least, neglect of duty and obedience to theit mothers: but let all children that haue any care to please God, set against all these things Gods Commandement, that bindes them to yeeld obedience to their Mothers, aswell as to their Fa∣thers, and know it for a truth, thou dost not yeeld obedi∣ence to thy Father for conscience towards God, but in some other sinister and by-respect, because he can reward thy obedience, or punish thy contempt, if thou yeeld it
not also to thy mother; and withall remember that obe∣dience to thy parents, not to thy father alone or mo∣ther alone, but to both Father and mother is the obedience that pleaseth God, if thou thinke to please God by obeying the one, and denying obedience to the other, thou decei∣uest thy selfe, and if these things moue thee not to this du∣tie, yet at least consider with thy selfe, the great paines of thy Mother, peculiar to her, what it cost her in thy brea∣ding, bearing, and bringing foorth, shee bare thee in her wombe with much sorrow and griefe, and at last, with great paine and danger brought thee foorth, and beeing brought foorth, her paines and care intending of thee, far surpassed the paines and care of thy Father, and it may bee her loue was euer greater towards thee, then the loue of thy Father, and ought not these things to preuaile with thee, to yeeld her reuerence and obedience, as well as to thy Father? If they doe not, surely it argues, thou art ei∣ther exceeding blockish and void of vnderstanding, or else altogether vnnaturall to thy mother. Now, heere happily it may bee demanded,  to which of the Parents the child is most bound? Whether the child be more bound to the Father or to the Mother? For answer to this, we must know there be three things that a child doth owe to his Parents, (namely) reuerence, obedience, and releefe and maintenance, if the Parents be in any want: and the third and last of these,The vnnatu∣ralnesse of children who denie reliefe to their poore and distrssed, and helpelesse Parents. the very light of nature teacheth, (and by the way to touch it) If a child denie to succour and releeue (according to his power) the poore, old, distressed, and helplesse Father or Mother, he is worse then some bruit creatures: its said of the Storks that when they are olde they keepe the nest continually, and their young birds (by the instinct of nature) prouide for them, and feed them till they die. Thinke on this, thou that thinkest thy poore Father, or mother, a burden and a clog to thee, and thinkest euery day a yeere till they bee dead, art thou woorse then an vnreasonable creature?
and canst thou then thinke there is any grace in thee? Certainly no, it cannot bee that there is any dramme of grace in the heart of that childe who denies reliefe to his poore helpelesse parents, yea, who spares it not from his owne backe, and from his own belly, to releeue his poore old Father or Mother (but that by the way.) Now to the question propounded, I answer, that reue∣rence is equally to bee yeelded, to the Father and to the Mother, as they are parents, but if any personall gift, or grace of wisdome, or vertue bee more eminent, and ap∣peare in the one, then in the other, bee it in the Father, or in the Mother, in that respect more honour is there to bee yeelded touching reliefe and maintenance, that is also e∣qually to be yeelded to the poore Father and to the poore Mother, they beeing both one, they are to bee fed at one table, and no difference to bee made betweene them in that repect, but concerning obedience, because man is the head of the woman, and master of the familie, that is rather to be giuen to the commandement of the fa∣ther then of the mother, if the father and mother com∣mand diuers, or contrary things. Some may further demand, whether obedience is to be yeelded to the Father, or Mother in law? Answer: It is, euen as to there naturall parents; wee haue the example of Moses, Exod. 18.24. Ruth to Naomi, her mother in law, Ruth 3.5. Yea, Christ our Sauiour was obedient to his supposed Father, Luke 2.51. And the Pro∣phet Micah 7.6. reckons it vp among the great sins of his time, that the daughter in law rose vp against her mother in law; therefore doubtlesse, children are to yeeld obedi∣ence, not onely to their naturall parents, but also to their fathers in law, and to their step-mothers. Obserue we further that the Apostle vrging children to yeelde obedience to their parents; hee saith, Children obey your Parents in all things, for that is well-pleasing vnto the Lord: that thing (namely) obedience to parents is wel-pleasing
to the Lord. Hence comes a question to be discussed, (namely) this,  whether obedience to Parents, yeelded by children vn∣beleeuing, and vnregenerate, bee well-pleasing to God, or no? To this I answer:  Obedience to Parents yeelded by children vnbeleeuing and vnregenerate, as it is their per∣sonall obedience, and considered in the concrete that is together with their persons, and as comming from them its not pleasing to God: for as the Apostle saith, Rom. 8.8. They that are in the flesh cannot please God: and it is a true rule, that the person must first please God,Note. before his per∣sonall actions, as they are his actions can be pleasing vnto him, but as that obedience is an action, and a duty conside∣red in the abstract that is by it selfe apart from the person, its pleasing to God, because its a thing commanded of God, and simply good in it selfe, in it owne nature, as is hearing of the word, praying and such like, as these things considered in themselues, and by themselues are good, and pleasing to God, though not as they come from vn∣regenerate and vnbeleeuing persons, so is obedience to Parents, yet know we thus much further, that howsoeuer obedience to Parents, yeelded by children vnbeleeuing, as it is their personall obedience, cannot please God; yet no doubt, the Lord of his exceeding bounty doth some∣times vouchsafe temporall good things, and blessings,Note. e∣uen to such obedience.Note. Such is the rich goodnesse of our good and gracious God, as of his aboundant mercy, hee doth sometimes giue outward blessings, euen to the ciuill obedience and outward good carriage of hypocrites and vnbeleeuers. Will we see some examples of it? No doubt Iehu King of Israel was but a carnall man, he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboham who made Israel to sinn; yet because he diligently executed that which was right in the eies of the Lord in some things, the Lord promised him that his
posteritie to the fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel, 2. King, 10.30. Ezechiel 29.30. Wee finde that Aegypt is promised to Nebuchadnetzar, King of Babel, (a man without question vnbeleeuing) for his seruice a∣gainst Tyrus. Oh then the exeeeding rich bounty of the Lord our God. How ought this to stirre vp children to yeelde obedi∣ence to their parents? That is a thing to which the Lord no doubt, will sometimes of his rich bounty, vouchafe temporall blessings, though it bee performed by children vnbeleeuing, Therefore this ought to stirre vp all children to this dutie, and if thou bee a childe within Gods coue∣nant, and a true beleeuing member of Christ, let it most of all encourage thee to yeeld obedience to thy Parents, and euer remember thou to thy comfort, that if the Lord carrie his eie of bounty towards them that are without, and strangers from his fold, much more will he of his rich mercie, reward thee that art one of his owne chosen, and a sheepe of his owne pasture: thinke on it, and remem∣ber it. Consider wee yet further, the ground of the Apostles reason in this place; he saith, Children obey your Parents in all things, for that is wel-pleasing to the Lord: What is the ground of this? How knew the Apostle that Obedience to Parents is a thing well-pleasing to God? Surely, hee knew it from the Commandement of God, because such obedience is commanded in the 5. Commandement, and he knew it to be in an high degree well-pleasing to God, because that comandement is as the Apostle saith, Eph. 6.2. The first Commandement (namely) of those that concerne our duty to men, and the first Commandement with promise, with a speciall promise annexed to it, that thy daies may bee prolonged vpon the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee. Hence it was that our Apostle knew this duty of obedience to parents to be wel-pleasing, yea, better pleasing to God then any other dutie of the
seconde Table, and this reason thus considered with these groundes of it dooth affoord vnto vs this conclu∣sion. That Gods good lykinge of any thinge, is to bee ga∣thered from his will reuealed,Gods good li∣king of any thing, is to be gathered frō his will reuea∣led. we must gather the good li∣king, and aprobation of the Lorde, that hee likes, and that hee approues, this or that thing, from his word. For in deede, what hee willeth in his worde, that hee liketh, his will there reuealed being the rule of all our ho∣linesse and goodnes: nothing done by vs, is holy & good & pleasing to him, but that which he there willeth. And hence it is, that the Apostle puts them together. Ro. 12.2. that wee may proue what is the good will of God, and ac∣ceptable and perfect, what God willeth, being good be∣cause hee wils it, and being willed by him and soe good, is also acceptable and pleasing to him. Micha. 6.6.7. The prophet bringes in man thus demaundinge, where-with shall I come before the Lord, and how shall I bowe my selfe before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, and calues of a yeere old? will the Lorde be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand riuers of oyle? shall I giue my first borne, for my trans∣gression: euen the fruite of my body, for the sinne of my soule? will these thinges please the Lord? and then vers. 8. The prophet answeres, hee hath shewed thee ô man what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee; sure∣ly to doe iustlie, and to loue mercie, and to humble thy selfe to walke with thy God: as if hee had saide, that which the LORD hath shewed, and reuealed to thee to bee good, and that which hee requires of thee in his word, that is the thing that is pleasing to him. Now then is it soe that the LORDES good li∣kinge, and approbation of any thinge, & that hee likes this or that, and is pleased with it, is to bee gathered from his will reuealed. I might then apply this to discouer the folly of the
Papists, who thinke they doe things highly pleasing to God, yea, meriting at his hands and deseruing heauen, when they doe things that can finde no footing in the word of God, and are not grounded on any commande∣ment or example or promise in the word of God, but are meerely Idolatrous and superstitious, but not to spend time in shewing their folly. Consider wee the doctrine as it may concerne vs to this purpose,A direction touching things done pleasing to God. it may serue to guide vs that we be not deceiued, touching things done pleasing to God, wee are not to conclude things to bee pleasing to God from our owne fancie and our owne opinion, because wee conceiue and think them to be liked of God and pleasing vnto him, but from the word and promise of God, manie deceiue them∣selues in this respect, they thinke they doe things highly well pleasing to God, and such as hee doth greatly like and approoue of, when indeede and truth there is no such matter, for example, doe not many thinke that their true and iust dealing with men, their giuing euerie man his owne, and the like things done by them, are things ex∣ceeding well pleasing to the Lord, though those deedes come not from anie sanctified heart, nor from the roote of a sound iustifying faith, nor yet are done with anie re∣gard of Gods glorie? Doe not manie thus thinke? it is too euident, they do, and in respect of doing such things, they thinke they are greatlie in Gods fauour, indeed it cannot bee denied, but that such things for the substance of them, and considered in themselues, & by themselues are grounded on the com∣mandements of God, but thou must further know that they must also bee done in such manner as the word hath prescribed, they must proceed frō faith purging thine hart from the naturall corruption of it, & they must be done in loue to God,Heb. 11.6. Rom. 14.23. & with respect of his glory, els its vnpossible they should please God, & therfore do not thou gather & conclude that God is well pleased, with the things thou
doest only because the things done are good in thēselues, if thou doe, thou deceauest tby selfe, thou gatherest Gods acceptance & good liking only from thine owne fancy, & the deuill and thine owne corrupt heart deceiue thee, and thus are many thousands deceiued, it was Pauls case be∣fore his conuersion, when hee was in the worst case, hee thought himselfe in the best, and before he knew the mea∣ning of the law, he made no doubt but hee was aliue, but when hee saw the sence and strict iustice of the commaun∣dement hee found sinne aliue in him, and himselfe dead, and so thousands in the world beeing as yet in their natu∣rall corruption, thinke they doe things highly pleasing to God, but alas they deceiue themselues, and therefore if thou tender thine owne good, take thou heed of it,Rom. 7 9.10. and remember that thou must not onely doe good things, that is, things warranted by the word of God, but in that man∣ner that the word hath prescribed with an heart purged by faith, with a loue to God, and a due respect to his glory, that thou maist gather Gods good liking and approbati∣on of things done by thee, and if it be otherwise with thee, surely the good things done by thee are hatefull to God, and they bring in the end but euerlasting death vpon thy soule. VER. 21. Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, least they be discouraged. In this verse the Apostle comming particularly to speak to parents touching their duty towards their children, he sets down what he requires of them by way of prohibition or dehortation, hee forbids that, and dehorts them from that wherein commonly parents are faulty, & wherin they many times offend, and that is immoderate seuerity and rigorous dealing with their children which is expressed by the effect it commonlie works in children, that it stirs
them vp to anger, and the Apostle doth direct his dehor∣tation, specially to fathers, and saith, Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, because if either of the Parents of∣fend in rigour towards their children, it is commonly the father, the mother, more vsually offending on the con∣trarie part, by too much indulgence and tendernesse, ther∣fore the Apostle saith, Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, and this prohibition or dehortation, hee doth fur∣ther strengthen by an argument taken from the dange∣rous euent of immoderate seuerity and rigour of Parents towards their children, namely their deiection of minde, their discouragement, least (saith the Apostle) they be dis∣couraged, & so the sum & substance of this ver, is a dehor∣tation vsed to Parents, especially to fathers, disswading them from rigour towards their children, and from hard vsage of them for feare of their discouragement. By fathers wee are heere to vnderstand naturall Pa∣rents,Interpreta∣tion. both fathers and mothers, though the Apostle (for the reason before yeelded, doth thus direct his dehortati∣on, the word here rendered (prouoke not to anger) properly signifies to exasperate, & to stir vp to anger by disgraceful termes, and by contumelious speeches, but wee are to take it in a larger sence and signification according to that Ephes. 6.4 Where in our English translation, wee haue in effect the same words, that here we find, but in the ori∣ginall, there is a differēt word vsed by the Apostle  a word reaching further, and comprehending more vn∣der it, signifying to irritate or to stirre vp to anger any way, to giue children any occasion of anger, and that vn∣iust and sinnefull anger, euen such as is spoken of E∣phes. 4.25. let not the sunne go downe vpon your wrath, the word is there also , (that is) vniust and sinne∣full anger, so then that word in the Ephesians, and this considered together, the meaning is, fathers doe not ex∣asperate and stirre vppe your children any way either by worde or deede to vniust and sinnefull anger, or rather
thus, vse no hard and rigorous dealing with your chil∣dren, whereby they may haue occasion to bee stirred vp to vniust and sinnefull anger, least they bee discouraged, (that is) least they bee deiected and cast downe in their mindes, and put out of all heart (for so the word signifies) least they bee put out of all courage, and comfort, and e∣uen despaire of doing any thing pleasing vnto you. Thus then wee are to conceiue the Apostles meaning in the words of this verse, as if he had sayd. You that are naturall Parents, and especially you fathers, doe not you abuse your fatherly au∣thority ouer your children, doe not you any way exasperate and stirre vp your children to anger, vse not you any hard and rigorous dealing to∣wards them, whereby they may haue occasion to be stirred vp to vniust and sinnefull anger; least you so doing, your childrens mindes bee deie∣cted in them, and they put clean out of hart, and lose all courage and comfort, and euen de∣spaire of doing any thing pleasing vnto you. I might heere note that of Parents, which before wee obserued of husbands, verse the nineteenth, that Parents also are prone to abuse their authority ouer their chil∣dren, and therefore the Apostle thought it most fit, to checke that pronenesse, and to warne Parents, especially, and aboue all things, to auoyd rigour and immoderate se∣uerity towards their children,Note. and indeede it is the com∣mon fault of all superiours (if they bee not sanctified) to abuse their authority, and to exercise rigour and tyranny ouer such as be vnder them: but I will not stand on that, hauing already handled it: Heere we may see it plainelie laid before vs.
That Parents are not to bee rigorous in their dealing with their children,Parents must take heed of rigorous dea∣ling with their children. they are not to vse any immoderate seuerity towards them. And this is cleare, both from this text, and that also, E∣phes. 6.4. The reason  and ground of it, is also manifest (namely) this extreame rigour and immoderate seuerity in any su∣periour towards the inferiour, is a fault and a sinne, inferi∣ours are to be held within compasse of their duty and o∣bedience, rather by loue then by feare, rather by lenity and mildnesse, then by rigour and seuerity: and if Parents bee extreame rigorous towards their children, their sinne is greater then the sinne of other hord dealing superiours, because they are more neerely bound to their children, their children beeing parts of themselues, hauing issued out of their owne loynes, therefore Parents ought least of any other to bee extreamely rigorous, and immoderately seuere towards their children but not to stay in the gene∣rall which may happily bee misconceiued, know wee, that hard and extreame rigorous dealing of Parents to∣wards their children, stands chiefely in these three things,Rigorous dea∣ling of Pa∣rents with their children is in 3. things. Either in commanding their children vniust or vnrea∣sonable things, when they seeing the pliablenesse of their  childrens mindes, that they are willing and ready to doe any thing at their command, doe lay more on them then  is fit, or command them to doe that which is vniust and sinnefull. Or secondly, in giuing them hard words rating reuiling, and miscalling them, and reproaching them for  euery thing they doe. Or thirdly, in striking or beating them either without iust cause, or excessiuely more then the cause requires, correcting them at their pleasure, saith the Authour to the Hebrewes, chap. 12.10. in their passi∣on and rage, many times (as we vse to say) without either rhime or reason. Parents are not to be extreeme rigorous towards their children in any of these three kindes, wee haue example of all these three in wicked Saul, hee was a
wicked man, and he added this to the measure of his sinne he abused his fatherly authority in all these three things, 1. Sam. 20. from verse 30. to the end of the 33. wee finde that Saul in his rage commanded Ionathan his sonne a most vniust thing, euen to bring Dauid to him, that hee might kill him, and what could bee more vniust, that a kind friend should bring his deare friend, and that an in∣nocent man should deliuer another innocent party into the hands of his malicious enemy that ment to shedde his bloud? yea he reuiled him verse 30. he called him the son of the wicked and rebellious woman, the son of an impu∣dent whore, in plaine termes, bastard, and hee went yet further, verse 33. hee cast a speare at him to hit him, with a purpose to kill him, this manner of rigorous dealing of a wicked and wretched father towards his sonne, hath the Scripture recorded to teach all Parents to auoyd the like, and that they seeing the rigorous dealing of a father to∣wards his childe pointed out in the booke of God, as one of the great sinnes of wicked Saul, might take notice of it, that it ought to bee farre from all those that would not be like so wicked a father, and what Parents soeuer make a∣ny conscience of their duty, ought to bee farre from ex∣treame rigour and immoderate seuerity, towardes their children, either in their commands, or in their reproofes, or their corrections. Now heerein many Parents are faulty,  some there bee who are iustly to bee taxed, as highly offending in this kinde, who command their children vnreasonable things,Reproofe of Parents dea∣ling rigorou∣sly with their children. euen things beyond their ability and strength, and if such things bee not done, abridge them of their meate and drinke, and of things needefull, and do not some Parents load their children with most odious and fowle names, calling them rogues, rascals, and filthy carrions, dogges, and the like. Yea, (which is strange) specially in the mother, some∣times calling the childe (Whore-sonne) if the childe bee
the sonne of an whore, what is then the mother; yet see how some Parents, rather then they will want a foule (by-name) for their childe, will not sticke to lay a blot on themselues, and are there not some, who in beating their children are extreamely rigorous, and handle them as if they were no better then dogges? Nay surelie, one of tender bowels, would not so vse his dogge as some Pa∣rents in their rage vse (or rather abuse) their children, yea, I wish there were not some who doe vaunt of their rigour and seueritie, and say, they will make them knowe that they are their Parents, these things are too common in the world. Well, let such as know themselues faultie in these things, bee humbled for that which is past, and hence∣foorth learne to know, that it is a great and greeuous sinne in thee whosoeuer thou art to be extreamely rigorous and seuere in thy dealing with thy children, either in requi∣ring things aboue the strength of thy childe, or in thy censuring of him, either in word or deede, and doe not thou thinke with thy selfe, what skils it, what matter is it if I deale with my childe as I list? am not I his father, and must not hee, will hee nill hee, bee subiect to mee, and to my authority? it is true, indeede thy childe is to bee sub∣iect to thy power and authority. If thou command him some vniust and vnlawfull thing, howsoeuer thy childe is not to obey thee in do∣ing of that, yet if thou adde further rigour, and fall vp∣on him, and beate him for not doing of it, thy childe is not to mutter or murmure against thee, and if hee bee stirred vppe to any impatience, that is his fault, yet thou must know that thy power and authority ouer thy childe is limited also,Two things to be conside∣red of Parents who deale ri∣gorously with their children thou maist not vse it after thine own plea∣sure, and bee rigorous and outragious in thy dealing with thy childe, if thou bee, surelie thou art an vn∣naturall Parent, thou sinnest against the light of na∣ture
euen bruit beasts will loue their younge ones, and vse them louinglie, and if nature require this at thy hand, what then should grace worke in thine heart? Thinke on it, and withall remember the Apostles argument in this place, thy hard and iniurious dealing with thy child, will dull and discourage him, it cannot otherwise choose, be∣cause thou art so neerely bound to thy child, and thy child to thee; when the child shall consider, it is my Father, or my mother, who should doe mee most good, that deales thus hardly with me, and doth me most ill: Oh, it is a great discouragement to the childe, it takes from the childe all courage to any good dutie, either in thy seruice, or in the seruice of God, and therefore take heede of it. Happilie some will say,  are not children offending to bee censured, and corrected by their Parents, and com∣mitting some great offence, are they not to be dealt with∣all accordinglie. Yes doubtlesse, they are,  yet Parents are wiselie to con∣sider the nature and qualitie of the childes offence, and to proportion their censure and correction as neere as they can answerable to the same. As it is a fault for Parents to be too rigorous to their children,It is a fault in Parents to bee to indulgent to their chil∣dren. so on the other side it is also a fault in them to bee too remisse, and too indulgent, and too much to tender and cocker them, this was Dauids fault, 1. Kin. 1.6. the text saith, He would not displease Ado∣niah his Sonne from his childhood, to say, why hast thou done so? And this is the fault of too manie Parents in these daies, and especiallie of manie foolish mothers, who so dandle their children, and are so vainelie pleased with them, that euen their faults also please them; they delight to heare them sweare, and to missecall others; this is to let loose the reines of fatherlie authoritie, and to lay the bridle on the neckes of their children, and so doing, they make them wantons, and dissolute persons, and as much as in them is, bring the curse of God vpon their children.
Censure and correction of children is necessary, for as Salomon saith, Prou. 22.15. Foolishnesse is bound in the heart of a childe, but the rodd of correction shall driue it away from him; there is a bundle of frowardnesse, stubbornesse, va∣nity, and wickednesse, bound vp in the heart of a child; Iob 11.12. A man new borne is like a wilde Asse colt, but the rod of correction shall driue it away from him. It is therefore Salomons counsell, Prou. 23.13.14. Withhold not correcti∣on from the child, If thou smite him with the rod, he shall not die thou shalt smite him with the rodde, and shalt deliuer his soule from hell. Parents therefore are to correct their children offending, and if they doe not, they sinne; but they must take heed their censure and correction bee not extreame, and vnmeasurable, they must looke to the measure of it, that they exceede not measure in it, and that it may bee such as may profit their children.3. Rules to be obserued in correcting of children. And to that purpose, these rules are fit to bee thought vpon, and obserued. First, thy child deseruing correction, doe not thou flie vpon him in a passion, that bewraies more then brutish af∣fection, but seriously consider with thy selfe, the nature and qualitie of the offence, and how often, or seldome thy childe hath so offended, and accordinly fit thy correction as neere as thou canst. Secondly, correct thy childe with compassion in thine heart, euen with yearning bowels in the doing of it, con∣sider with thy selfe, that happily the frowarnesse, or curst∣nesse, and particular euill qualitie that is found in thy child hath been transmitted and conuaied from thee vnto him, and thou correcting thy childe, dost but punish thine owne sinne in thy childe; thinke with thy selfe, shall I thus punish mine owne sinne, and that in my childe? Shall I thus prosecute the corruption that I haue conuaid to my childe? Thirdly, let the chastisement of thy child be with a lif∣ting vp of thine heart to God in praier, that he hee would
giue thee a wise heart to giue correction, and thy childe a soft heart to receiue it with patience, and to profitte by it. And if these rules be obserued of thee in the correcting of thy childe, doubtlesse thou shalt doe it with mildnesse, and without rigour, and thou shalt doe it with profit to thy child, and with comfort to thy selfe; yea, thy child in such manner corrected will giue pleasures to thy soule, Prou. 29.17. Hee will vtter such gracious speaches, doe such righteous deeds, and haue such comely gestures, and pra∣ctise such obedience and thankfullnesse towards thee, as shall much delight thy soule; therefore remember the rules propounded. Marke we further, the Apostle laieth downe his prohi∣bition in these termes: Prouoke not your children to anger: Where we see, that howsoeuer children are not to be pro∣uoked to vniust anger, and if they bee, they cannot ex∣cuse themselues, that they are thereunto prouoked, yet Parents are not to giue them occasion of such anger; Pa∣rents are not to stirre them vp to it by their rigorus dealing with them. Hence we may raise this generall truth. Though no euill spring but from an euill roote, nor is∣sue  out but from an euill fountaine; yet, men are not to prouoke and stirre vp others to euill,Though eue∣ry euill doe spring from an euill root, yet men sinne in prouoking others to euil. nor to giue them oc∣casion to it; for although man can excuse himselfe by say∣ing, I was prouoked to ths or that euill, yet is not hee without his sinne, but many times his sinne is the greater, as our Sauiour said to Pilate, Ioh 19.11. Who hath prouo∣ked and stird vp another to euill For that is (indeed) to lay a stumbling blocke before another, and a fearefull woe is denounced against euerie one by whom offences come, Math. 18.7. Woe be vnto the world because of offences,  for it must needes bee that offences shall come, but woe bee to that man by whom the offence commeth, who giues the occasion of offence.
Reproofe of such as de∣light to stirre vp others to sinne, and the greatnesse of that sinne discouered.This serues to discouer the sinne of such as vse to pro∣uoke the cholericke to anger, the drunkard to excesse in drinking, the contentious person to quarrelling and take pleasure, and make themselues sport in stirring vp others to sinne; thou must know, whosoeuer thou art, that in so doing thou makest thy selfe guiltie of great sinne; for in so doing thou seruest the Deuils turne, thou art his instru∣ment, yea thou takest on thee the Deuils trade, and that is the worst trade in the world; its his trade and manner to spie out to what sinne men are most naturally incli∣ned, and there to assault them, and wilt thou bee like the Deuill? Againe, consider with thy selfe, with what conscience canst thou be a meanes to draw others into temptation, whereas the Lord requires thee to pray for thy selfe and others, Leade vs not into temptation? And remember thou the punishment of the Serpent, Gen. 3.14. for beeing an instrument of the Deuill in tempting our first Parents; if the naturall Serpent was so plagued for beeing an instru∣ment of the Deuill in his temptation, vnknowingly, what shall become of thee, if thou applie thy wit, thy tongue, and heart, to doe him seruice in this kinde? Surely, as thou art the Deuils instrument, and like him in thy pra∣ctise, so thou maiest iustly looke one day to bee like him in punishment: and if they that turne many to righte∣ousnesse, shall one day shine as the starres for euer and e∣uer, Dan 12.3. Then surelie, thou that turnest many from righteousnesse, and stirrest them vp to sinne, shalt bee as blacke as the blacknesse of Hell, and to thee as Iude speakes verse 13. is reserued the blackenesse of darke∣nesse for euer. Thinke on it, and know it is not so small a matter, as its commonly thought to bee, to make others drunke, or stirre then to any sinne. One thing further, may be briefly noted from this verse (namely) this, that the Apostle would not haue childrens mindes discouraged, Fathers prouoke not your chidren to an∣ger,
least they be discouraged, saith the Apostle, hee would not haue their mindes daunted and cast downe in them. Hence we are taught. That Parents are chiefely to take heede of doing any  thing that may daunt the minds of their children, and dis∣courage them, and make them that they haue no heart to do good things,Parents must take great heed of doing any thing that daunt the minds of their children and discourage them from good things. they are rather to encourage, and to hear∣ten them to euery good dutie; yea, if parents espie but a∣ny good minde, and good inclination in their children, if they discerne but any seed of grace, or good gift, spring∣ing vp in their minds or hearts, if they perceiue any prone∣nesse in them to religion, any desire after some speciall good calling, as happily to the Ministry, or the like, they are to cheerish it, and according to their power, they are to vse all good meanes that it may be increased, at least to water that tender budde with the drops of sweet counsell, and with the word of comfort and encouragement, and to send vp to heauen by praier, that the Lord would warm it by his spirit, and raine downe his blessing vpon it, that it may grow to some ripenesse. They are altogether vnworthy the name of parents,  who grieue at the good graces of their children,Reproofe of such Parents as grieue at the good gra∣ces of their children. and restraine them from all meanes whereby they might attaine to fur∣ther increase of them. Good Parents, and they haue any soundnesse of grace in their owne hearts, will be glad and much reioice to see the lest begining of grace in their chil¦dren, they delight to see grace in any other whosoeuer, but most of all appearing in their owne children,Note. and they wil carefully vse al good meanes that serue for the increase of it, and they will euer encourage and hearten on their children in euery good duty.
VER. 22. Seruants bee obedient vnto them that are your Masters, according to the flesh, in all things, not with eye seruice, as men-plea∣sers, but in singlenesse of heart, fearing God. The Apostle hauing laid downe the speciall duties of those in the Family, who are more neerely tied one to an∣other. Now he comes to the duties of such as are lesse bound one to another, (namely) to the duties of Masters and Seruants, and following his former order, he beginnes with the dutie of seruants, and the condition of seruants being harder then any other, he sets downe their dutie in more words then any of the rest. First exhorting to it in the 22. and 23. verses, and then strengthning his exhortation by force of argu∣ment, vers. 24.25. In this 22. verse, wee haue two things in generall laid be∣fore vs. First, the duty of seruants generally propounded by way of exhortation in these words. Seruants be obedient vn∣to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, in al things, and then the manner of their obedience in the words fol∣lowing, Not with eye-seruice, as men-pleasers, but in singlenes of heart, fearing God. Touching the exhortation to the du∣tie more particularly the Apostle doth first propound it, and exhort to it indefinitely, Seruants be obedient to your ma∣sters) and then he amplifies his exhortation both by de∣scribing their masters, that they are their masters accor∣ding to the flesh, and by setting downe how farre foorth obedience is to bee yeelded vnto them, (namely) in all things: Seruants be obedient vnto them that are your Masters according to the flesh, in all things. Let vs first examine the words of this exhortation tou∣ching
the sense and meaning of them. (Seruants) In the time of the Apostle when hee writ this Epistle,Interpre∣tation. such were properlie cald (Seruants) as were taken in warre, and kept in bondage, or such as were bought with money, and indeed slaues to their masters, but wee are to take the word in a larger sense, for seruants of any sort whosoeuer, euen such as our seruants are, who serue for wages, or as Aprentices, (be obedient) the original word heere vsed is the same we had, verse 20. and the mea∣ning is the same; Seruants listen and hearken to your ma∣sters, and yeeld to them, and obey them in that they say, or doe to you, (according to the flesh) these words haue re∣lation to the word (Masters) Masters according to the flesh, and the meaning is, to your masters who haue pow∣er onely ouer your bodies and not ouer your soules and consciences (in all things) that is, in all things your masters say, or doe to you, being things honest and law∣full, for so much is implied in that masters haue power onely ouer the bodies of their seruants, and not ouer their soules, so as if the master command his seruant any thing against the libertie of a good conscience, he is not therein to be obeyed. Thus then wee are to conceiue the meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had said. You that are seruants of any sort whatsoeuer, doe you yeelde to that which is said, or done to you by your Masters, who haue power ouer your bodies, but not ouer your soules and consciences, yeelde to them entire obedience, obey them in all things, honest and lawfull. Now heere, first, the speciall dutie of obedience due  from seruants to their Masters, comes to bee considered,Seruants are bound to yeeld obedi∣ence to their masters. and touching that, I will shew first what that obedience is.
The order obserued in handling that obedienceSecondly, wherein it consisteth. Thirdly, the persons whom it concernes. And fourthly, how farre foorth it is to bee yeelded by seruants to their Masters; then after some particular exa∣mination, I will adde some motiues to stirre vp seruants to this duty. What the o∣bedience of seruants to their masters is.First therefore know, that this obedience is a willing, and cheerefull yeelding of seruants to the voice and will of their masters, euen a cheerefull yeelding to that which is said to them of their masters, and willed by their masters to be done or suffered of them. Seruants obe∣diēce to their masters is in two things.And this willing and cheerefull yeelding of seruants to the voice and will of their masters stands in two things. First, in a cheereful doing of things commanded by their  masters, though the things commanded, be neuer so base, or neuer so laborious, and painefull, Luke 17.7. Christ sets downe this clearely, ween he saith, Which of you is it that hauing a seruant plowing, or feeding cattell, would say vn∣to him by and by, when he were come from the field, goe, and sit downe at table: as if hee had said, if a seruant that hath beene toiling all the day long in following the plow, or the like labour, at night when he comes home wearie and hungrie, be commanded by his master a further seruice, hee is not to refuse to doe it, he is still to doe what his ma∣ster commands him. Secondly, the yeelding of a seruant to the will of his master is in a meeke and patient bearing of that rebuke, or correction that is laid on him by his master, yea, though the correction be without iust cause, or vnreasonable, and more excessiue then it ought to be. 1. Pet. 2.18. Seruants saith the Apostle, be subiect to your Masters with all feare, not onely to the good and courteous, but also to the froward, euen to such as are froward, crabbed, and peruerse, and wrongfully buffet you, for so it followes, vers. 20.21. For what praise is it, if when ye bee buffeted for your faults yee take it patiently? but and if yee doe well, yee suffer wrong and take
it patiently, this is acceptable to God. Seruants are in silence to suffer the checks and rebukes of their masters, not answering againe as it is Tit. 2.9. not muttering or murmuring, not giuing one word for another, and they are patiently to beare that correction that is laid on them by their masters, though it bee vniust or excessiue, and therefore say not then, being a seruant, when thou art vniustly corrected, I deserue not to bee so roughly dealt withall, but remember thou deseruest more at Gods hand for some other sinne, and the hand of thy master is but the instrument of God, for the punish∣ment or correction of that other sinne which is in thee. Now for the persons whom this duty concernes,The duty of obedience to masters con∣cernes all ser∣uants whatso∣euer they be. that is layd downe in the first word (Seruants) the Apostle heere also not limiting this duetie to seruants, of this or that sort, but saying indefinitely (seruants) wee are gi∣uen to vnderstand that the duetie belongs to all ser∣uants, whether they bee bound to their masters, or serue for wages, or howsoeuer, say not thou, I am but a Iour∣ney man, or I am but hired for a day, or my master is my brother, my vncle, or my kinsman, and therefore I am not bound to such duety and obedience as others, no, no, remember that Iacob serued his vncle Laban Genesis the twentie nine. If thou bee a seruant, to whomsoeuer, or for how long or how short a time, thou art bound to yeelde obedience to him that is thy master, both wil∣lingly, dooing what hee commaundes thee, and pa∣tiently suffering what hee laies on thee, either in word or deed. Forth the fourth thing,A seruant must obey his master in all things honest and lwfull. how farre foorth this duty is to bee yeelded by seruants to their masters, that is ex∣pressed in these wordes (in all things) thou art a ser∣uant, thou must yeelde obedience to thy Master not in some thinges, such as are most easie, or doe best a∣gree with thine owne fancie, dooing what likes thee,
but thou art to doe what things soeuer pleaseth thy ma∣ster, Tit. 2.9. what he will haue thee doe, being not con∣trary to the word of God, beeing things honest and law∣full, indeede if thy master command thee to lie, to sweare, or the like, thou art not therein to yeelde to his commandement, but in all indifferent and lawfull things, obedience must be yeelded by the seruant to his master. Now if seruants trie themselues by that which hath beene deliuered,Triall of ser∣uants touch∣ing their duty of obedience to their Ma∣sters, and their failings therin discouered. out of question most seruants will, finde themselues farre short of that duty they owe to their masters. It is a general complaint that seruants were neuer worse then now in these daies, and indeede scarse one seruant of a thousand makes conscience of that obedience that is due to his master, where is almost the seruant to bee found that yeeldes willing and cheerefull obedience to the voice and will of his Master, or Mistresse, or Dame, for the worde (Masters) is to bee vnderstood of both? where is that seruant that willingly doth that which is commanded by his Master, or Mistresse or Dame, and with meekenesse and patience beares that rebuke or cor∣rection they lay on him or her? Nay, doe not many seruants, beeing bidden doe one thing doe another, and euen what they list themselues? and if they bee rebuked are they not ready to reply? doe they not answer againe, and giue one hard word for another? are they not some∣times as lowd as their masters? and if they be corrected doe they not many times take the staffe by the end, and resist? yea, do they not sometimes curse their Master or Mistresse, or Dame, and wish a plague or mischiefe to light on him, or her, or on the hand that strikes them? those thinges and manie other of like sort, are too common with seruants, and are matters of iust complaint in the mouthes of most gouernours of fami∣lies.
Well, let all seruants now call themselues to a strict ac∣count, and examine themselues touching this duty of o∣bedience towardes their masters by that which hath beene said, and finding that thou hast heeretofore failed, bee humbled for thy failing, thy disobedience to thy ma∣ster is one of thy great sinnes, and till thou bee humbled for that, thou hast no true repentance. Therefore this day before to morrow bee humbled for that, and learne henceforwarde to make conscience of yeelding due obedience, to thy Master.2. Motiues to stirre vp ser¦uants to yeeld obedience to their Masters. And to help thee forward, consider with mee that so long as thou art disobedient to thy master, thou cannest  doe no good dutie of Gods worshippe either pleasing to God, or with comfort to thine owne soule, thou cannest not pray with comfort, heare the word, or receiue the sa∣craments with comfort, for why? thou liuest in a mani∣fest breach of Gods commandement, yea, thou causest his name to be euill spoken off, 1. Timoth. 6.1. how then cannest thou doe any thing either pleasing to God or comfortable to thine owne conscience? it is not possi∣ble. Againe, consider that thy master is but thy master ac∣according  to the flesh, he hath power onlie ouer thy body, but there is a master in heauen who hath power ouer both bodie and soule, and if thou pull thy necke from vnder the yoake of thy earthlie Master, and refuse to yeelde o∣bedience to him in thy bodie, happilie because he is an hard master, know that so doing thou bringest both thy bodie and soule vnder the yoke of Gods wrath, who hath power to destroie them both, eternallie in hell fire, bee therefore better aduised, and if thou desire to doe duties of Gods worship, pleasing to God, and with comfort to thy selfe, if thou wouldest not, by easing thy selfe (as thou thinkst) by withdrawing thy neck from vnder the yoke of this earthly master, (who can onlie deale hardlie with thy bodie) bring thy selfe vnder the heauie yoke of the wrath
of God, who can and will without thy true repentance, destroy both bodie and soule in the fire of hell, then in the feare of God, bee thou stirred vp to yeeld willing and cheerefull obedience to thy Master, do that thou art com∣manded, bee it neuer so base or laborious, beeing a thing lawfull, and suffer with meekenesse and patience that re∣buke and correction that is laid on thee by thy Master, and if thy Master correct thee vniustly, consider thou that it is the Lords will thou shouldest be vnder so sharpe a ma∣ster, and hee calls thee to suffer a little for his sake, who gaue his owne sonne to suffer so much for thee, if thou be∣long to Christ, therefore submit thy selfe and beare it qui∣etly, and lay aside all reasonings of the flesh that rise vp to the contrarie. As happilie thou wilt say, I could be content to beare rebukes and correction too at the hands of my master, if he were a man of anie account or reckoning in the world, were hee a magistrate or a minister, or some other man, but alas my master is a poore sillie man, one of the poorest in the place where he dwels, and therefore I cannot so well digest his rebukes, and so patientlie take correction at his hand. Take thou heed of this kind of reasoning, this comes from the suggestion of Satan, and from thine owne cor∣ruption, and know it for a truth, that be thy master neuer so poore, hee hath as much authoritie ouer thee, as the greatest man hath ouer his seruant, his pouerty doth no∣thing detract from his authoritie ouer thee, neither ought it to lessen thine obedience to him, and therefore make conscience of it to yeeld obedience to thy master, bee hee neuer so poore, or of neuer so meane condition in the world. And so much of the speciall dutie of seruants here laid before vs. One thing yet remaines to be obserued in these words namelie the description of masters; they are masters ac∣cording to the flesh, that is, such as haue full power
onely ouer the bodies, and not ouer the soules of their seruants, heere is then matter of comfort for seruants that are vnder hard and cruell masters,Comfort for seruants that are vnder cru∣ell masters. thy cruell master is but Master ouer thy body, hee can but exercise his cruelty ouer that, hee can neuer hurt thy soule, and hee can vse his power ouer thee, but during the time of this fraile and mortall life, in the graue the seruant is free from his ma∣ster, Iob. 3.19. Yea, if thou bee a seruant fearing God, and thy master a carnall man, heere is comfort for thee, thy master hath onely power ouer thy body, the chiefe part, thy soule and conscience are free, yea, freer then the soule of thy ma∣ster, for hee is a seruant to sinne,Note. but thou art the Lordes free-man, 1. Cor. 7.22. but the point espccially heere of∣fered is this. That the master hath not authority ouer the soule,  and conscience of his seruant, hee hath not power to im∣pose any new thing on his soule and conscience, any thing not warranted by the word of God,Masters haue not authority ouer the souls and conscien∣ces of their seruants to impose any thing vpon them not war∣ranted by the word of God. no, the master is not to command the body of his seruant so as may hinder the liberty of good conscience, as to command his seruant to attend him at a masse or some idolatrous seruice, if the master so command his seruant, he is not to obey him, as the Apostle saith, 1. Corinth. 7.23. we are bought with a price, be not the seruants of men, the Apostle there sim∣ply forbiddes not seruice to men, (for that were to con∣tradict himselfe in other places) but seruice and obedience to men in things not commanded by God, not warran∣ted in the word of God, a subiection of our willes in the case of religion to the will and pleasure of men, it is there∣fore a prophane speech to say, I will bee of what religion my master will haue me,  if hee will haue mee to bee a Pro∣testant, I will bee one, if a Papist, so I will bee,Reproofe of such seruants as pin their re∣ligion on their masters sleeue. that is to subiect thy soule to thy Master, whereas indeede, hee is but master ouer thy bodie, thy master according to the flesh.
A Popish Obiection.Indeed saith the Papist, (heere hee takes hold) secular masters and secular gouernours, be it Prince, or whosoe∣uer, they haue nothing to doe in matter of religion to im∣pose any new thing on their inferiours, they are but ma∣sters according to the flesh, but the Pope and his cleargie, beeing spirituall Masters, Masters in spirituall thinges, they may impose what they thinke meete on their in∣feriours. I answer them in a word, it is a meere deuice of their owne braine, to make a distinction of masters, according the flesh and spirituall masters, wee finde no such distin∣ction of masters in the word of God, the Apostle addes this note of difference (masters according to the flesh) to distinguish earthly masters, from our one onely Ma∣ster in Heauen, Christ Iesus, the onely Master of his Church, the house of God, and therefore this is but a Po∣pish fancy, that some are secular masters, and some are spi∣rituall masters, and that they may impose on their inferi∣ours what they thinke meete, this cannot stand with the truth of the word of God. Come wee to the second generall layd downe in this verse, (namely) the manner of obedience due from ser∣uants to their masters, in these words (not with eye ser∣uice as men pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart fearing God) wee see heere the Apostle sets downe both what manner of obedience seruants ought to yeelde to their masters, and the contrary to it, commanding the one, and forbidding the other, and he beginnes with the contrarie, which he cals eye-seruice, and tels seruants they are not to obey their masters with eye seruice, and least his speech should be mistaken and misconstrued in forbidding eye seruice, he further shewes what manner of eie seruice, hee forbids, namely, such as commonly come from men pleasers, from such as onely seeke to please men. Not with eye seruice (saith the Apostle) as men plea∣sers, and then hee comes to the right manner of obedi∣ence
thar seruants are to yeeld their masters, shewing that it ought ro bee contrary to that eie seruice, euen single or simple hearted obedience, euen such seruice as is done in singlenesse and simplicitie of heart, and hee doth further discouer the root of that, whence such single hearted ser∣uice springeth, (namely) from the feare of God. But in singlenesse of hert fearing God, and that is the generall re∣solution of the second part of this verse, setting downe the manner of obedience that servants owe to their Ma∣sters. Let vs cleare the words touching the true sence and meaning of them (with eye seruice) the originall word is in the plurall number,Interpre∣tation. (not with eye seruices) the meaning is not with duties of obedience performed to the eie, not doing the duties and things commanded by your ma∣sters, onely in the sight and presence of your masters onely when they are present and looke on you, or may come to the knowledge of that you doe, and if they turne their backes, or the things you doe shall neuer come to their knowledge, or at least you so imagine, then you either sit idle, or slacke your labour, or doe worse, as men pleasers, that is, as those who onely care to satisfie men, and to giue them contentment for the time, and haue no further respect (but in singlenesse and simplicitie heart (for so is the worde) the single or simple heart in Scrip∣ture, is vsuallie opposed to a double, hypocriticall, and deceitefull heart, and by it is meanr a sound, honest, and sincere heart, and the meaning of the Apostle is this. But dooing seruice to your Masters, in the simplicitie and truth of your hearts, without any manner of fraud or dissembling, euen from the sinceritie of your hearts, yeelding to your masters, sound, true, and faith∣full seruice, (fearing God) (that is) carrying in your hearts as the ground of such sincere and faithfull seruice, a reue. rent awe and holy feare of the great and glorious Maiestie of God, euen out of a holie loue to him, in regard of his
mercie, and of a reuerent loue of him, in respect of his iudgements and fearing to offend him in any thing. Thus then conceiue wee these words (not with eye-seruice, as men pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart fearing God) as if the Apostle had more largely spoken thus. Not doing the duties and things commanded by your masters onely, when your masters are pre∣sent, and looke on you, or may come to the know∣ledge of that you doe, at othertimes being idle or remisse, in your businesse, or doing amisse, as those who onely care to please men, and to giue them contentment and looke no further; but doe you euen from the sincerity of your hearts, yeeld to your Masters, sound, true and faithfull obe∣dience and seruice, euer carrying in your hearts a reuerent awe and holy feare of God, euen of a true loue to him for his mercie, and of a reuer∣rent awe of him in respect of his iudgements, fea∣ring to offend him in any thing. Now first from these wordes, expressing the manner of that obedience and seruice that is due from seruants to their Masters, seruants are further taught. That they must not onely yeelde obedience to their masters & do thē seruice, but they must do it in such man∣ner as it ought to bee done, and in speciall, their obedi∣ence and seruice must bee qualified as the Apostle hath heere expressed, it must not bee eye-seruice, obedience to the eye of the masters, but single hearted seruice and sincere, comming from the feare of God, seruants must yeelde to their masters true and faithfull obedi∣ence, they must doe them seruice truely and faith∣fully
aswell in the absence of their masters as in their pre∣sence, aswell when their masters cannot looke on them, or happily take account of their seruice, beeing imploi∣ed in other affaires farre distant from them, as when their masters stand ouer them and behold euery thing they doe. Sinceritie and faithfulnesse is required of seruants in  doing seruice to their masters, in all places, and at all times of imploiment, in any businesse of their master.Sincerity and faithfulnesse is required of seruants in do¦ing seruice to ther masters in all places, and at al times and in euery businesse of their masters. And further to prooue this, besides the euidence of this text, read Tit. 2.10. The Apostle there requires it in plaine termes, that seruants shew all good faithfulnesse to their masters, that they shew their sinceritie of heart in al things, for that (as I take it) is the meaning of the Apostle, when he saith (all good faithfulnesse) as if hee had said, seruants shew forth sound and sincere faithfulnesse in all your o∣bedience, and in all your seruices done to your masters, not to spend time in prouing the generall, but rather to make it manifest in the speciall branches of it: wee must know there be two things wherein that true and faithful seruice that seruants are to yeeld to their masters, especi¦ally consisteth (namely) in diligence, and in a care of their masters good. Seruants are to yeelde faithfull obedience to their ma∣sters,The things wherein the faithfull ser∣uice of seruāts consisteth. First, in a diligent performance of that busines they are set about by their masters, aswell in their absence as in their presence, not idling and loitering, and trifling out the time when their masters eie is from them; but at all times, doing that businesse whereabout they are im∣ploied, with the vttermost strength of their minde and body, or both, according to the quallity of the bu∣sinesse. And secondly, in a care of their masters good, and pro∣fit, and his lawful aduantage, not pilfring any of the bene∣fit of their labours to their owne vse, without the consent
of their masters, nor riotously and wastefully mispending their masters meate, drinke, or any of his goods, but be∣ing as carefull and as thriftie for their masters and their families as they would be for themselues and their fami∣lies, and that also aswell in the absence as in the presence of their Masters. Wil we see some examples of true and faithful seruice in both these kindes. Looke vpon Ioseph, Genes. 39. hee no doubt was diligent in the workes of his masters seruice, as we may gather by the Lords blessing on his labours, hee was also carefull of his masters goods, insomuch as the text saith verse 6. That his master left all that he had in Io∣sephs hand, and tooke account of nothing that was with him, and verse 8. That his master knew not what he had in the house with him, but committed al that he had to his hand. But most excellent and memorable in this kind, is the example of Iacob, Gene. 31. vers. 38. to ende of verse 40. This 20. yeeres, saith Iacob, haue I beene with thee, thine ewes & thy goats haue not cast their young, and the rams of the flocke haue I not eaten. Verse 39. Whatsoeuer was torne of beasts I brought it not to thee, but made it good my selfe, of mine hand didst thou require it, were it stollen by day, or stollen by night. There was his faithfull care for the the goods of his Master, he was so farre from pil∣fring any thing from his master, as hee made good that which was lost, and for his paines and diligence, hee saith, That hee was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and his sleepe departed from him. Heere is indeed an example of single hearted, and faithful seruice yeelded by a seruant to his master; let all seruants looke on this example, and consider it, and if they duly consi¦der it, and thereby examine their owne practise, no doubt it will conuince most seruants of vnfaithfulnesse towards their masters. If most of our seruants compare their manner of seruice
done to their masters, with this right line of true seruice,The vnfaith¦fulnesse of seruants in doing ser∣uice to their masters dis∣couered. it will discouer the wickednes of their hearts, & they must needs acknowledge they swerue far from the right maner of seruice they ought to yeeld to their masters; Doe not many seruants in their masters presence seeme to be very diligent and painefull, yea, carefull too for the good of their masters, and that their worke may be for his best ad∣uantage, and euery way seeme to yeeld to him true and faithfull seruice, but if once hee turne his backe to them, then they loiter & trislle out the time and care not which end goes forward; yea if they can hide their negligence and fraude, though it be by a lie, as Gehazi did, 2. King. 5.25. They care not, its the complaint of many masters, and no doubt a iust complaint, that their seruants wili doe little, or nothing, longer then they looke vpon them; yea that some of their seruants, if they looke not narrowly to them, will bee filtching, and steale from them, and con∣uert their goods to their owne vse, or wastefully mispend them; It not this the manner of seruice that many ser∣uants yeeld to their masters? Surely, if they deale truely with themselues, they must needes confesse it to bee so: Well, know it thou seruant, whosoeuer thou art, that this manner of seruice is but eye-seruice, this is not single, but double hearted and hypocriticall seruice; thou plaiest the hypocrite with thy master, and will the Lord suffer thee to goe vnpunished? No, no, assure thy selfe the Lord doth hate and abhorre hypocrisie in euery thing. Thou maist happily please thy selfe, and giue ease to thy selfe in thy negligence and idlenesse, or in thy pilfring and drawing things from thy master to thy selfe, but withall thou bringest woe to thy conscience, and the curse of God on thine owne soule; yea, so long as thou art a seruant one∣lie to the eie of thy master, and art vnfaithfull in his ser∣uice, thou eatest not thine owne bread, thou liuest thee∣uishly, though thou steale none of thy masters goods, and being idle, and in his absence neglecting his busines,
thou stealest away thy labour from him, which is as due to thy master as any of his goods; and therefore let euery seruant be admonished in the feare of God, to take heede of yeelding onely eye seruice to his master, and if thou wouldest not be guilty of hypocrisie and theft; two foule sinnes bringing fearefull iudgements, be thou stird vp, e∣uen in singlenesse of heart, to doe seruice to thy master, truelie and faithfullie; be as diligent and painefull in thy masters businesses, and as carefull of his lawfull profit, and best aduantage in his absence, as in his presence, and as well when he is many miles from thee, as when he is pre∣sent and lookes on thee, and take heede of the sinne of wicked Ziba, 2. Sam. 16.3. He was very vnfaithfull to his master: consider his example, and learne to auoide his sinne. Obserue we in the next place that the Apostle makes an opposition betweene eye-seruice pleasing to men, and singlenesse of heart. Whence it is cleare. That a seruant may doe seruice contenting the eye of his master,Note. and pleasing to him, and yet with a double and deceitfull heart; and though the Master bee a continuall beholder of the conuersation of his seruant, and his eye al∣waies on his seruice, yet he is not euery way a competent iudge of his good or ill seruice, for his seruant may doe seruice to his eie, and pleasing to him, and yet carrie in his breast a dissembling heart. Yea the point is generall. A man may doe good du∣ties, so as men cannot except against them, and yet with a double & hy∣pocriticall heart.A man may doe good duties contenting the eie of man, and pleasing to man, and yet with a double and hy∣pocriticall heart. Our Sauiour shewes it plainely, Matth. 6. That men may fast, and pray, &c. and in so doing, please men, and get their applause and commendation, and yet bee hypo∣crites and doe those things not in truth and sinceritie of heart, but in meere hypocrisie and with double hearts;
and the reason  of it is cleare (namely) this Nature can put on the counterfet and semblance of grace and make that seeme to men a gracious work which is done without any dramme of sanctifying grace in the heart. This must teach vs not to content our selues with the good liking and approbation of men,  touching any good dutie done by vs, we are not to thinke wee doe good du∣ties as we ought, because the things done are glorious in the eies of men, and men like and approue of them;Wee must not not rest in the good liking of men touching good duies done by vs, but labour to approue our hearts to the Lord in the doing of them no, no, we must gage our owne hearts in the doing of good duties, and looke that they bee done of vs in singlenesse and sincerity of heart, we may seeme to doe many good∣lie things before men, which men may applaud and high∣ly approue, and we may be thought petty Angels, and as it were dropt out of heauen, and yet be impoisoned at our hearts with vaine glorie, and hypocrisie, and the like; and therefore thinke not, thou dost good duties as they ought to bee done, vnlesse thine owne conscience (being instru∣cted by the word of God) beare thee witnesse, thou dost them in singlenesse and sincerity of thine heart, euer look to that in the doing of good duties; and assure thy selfe, if thine owne conscience witnesse against thee in the doing of any good dutie, that thou dost it in hpocrisie, or with desire of vaine glory, though all the world commend thee for it, yet the Lord hath no delight in thee, and if thine owne heart condemne thee, as Iohn saith, 1. Epist. 3.20. God is greater then thine heart, and much more will hee condemne thee; and therefore it concernes thee to looke to thine owne heart, and to the sincerity and vprightnesse of it in the doing of euerie good dutie. Marke we further, the Apostle saith not onely, with eye-seruice, but addes to it (as men-pleasers.) Hence a question may be moued (namely) this, Whe∣ther it be vtterly vnlawfull to please men?
Answer:  No, the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 10.33. that he pleased all men in all things, not seeking his owne profit, but the profit of many that they might bee saued. And Rom. 15.2. it is his precept, Let euery man please his neigh∣bour in that which is good to edification, and therefore it is not simply vnlawfull to please men. But that we may vnderstand how it is lawfull to please men and how it is not:How it is law¦full to please men, and how it is not. know we it is not lawfull to please men in sinne, and in euill things; and againe, its not law∣full to please men in good things, resting onely in the pleasing of them, and contenting our selues onely in their good liking, but its lawfull to please men in good things, and for their good; so did the Apostle in the places before cited, and in his precept, hee saith, Let euery man please his neighbour in that is good to edification; and againe, it is lawfull to please men in good things, so as wee rest not in the pleasing of them, but ayme also and that chiefely, at the pleasing of God. The last thing offered vnto vs in this verse, is from the last words of it, (fearing God) where the Apostle making the feare of God the roote of single hearted seruice vnder∣stand we thus much. That all good and faithfull seruice done by seruants to their masters, comes from the true feare of God,The good & faithfull ser∣uice that ser∣uants doe to their masters comes from the feare of God. that is the roote and fountaine of it; it was the feare of God that made Iacob and Ioseph so faithfull in doing seruice to their masters. And indeed, where the feare of God is truely grafted in the heart, it will cause men to make conscience of euerie sinne, and where that is wanting, as Abraham concluded,  Gen. 20.11. there no conscience is made of the greatest sinne.If thou woul∣dest be a faith¦full seruant, get Gods feare into thine heart. Wouldest thou then bee an obedient seruant, yeelding seruice to thy master in singlenesse of thine heart, then en∣deauour thou to haue thine heart seasoned with Gods grace and feare.
And againe for masters, dost thou desire a faithfull ser∣uant,  then seeke out such a one as feares God,If thou woul∣dest haue a faithfull ser∣uant, get one truly fearing God. Dauid pro∣fessed he would seeke such an one, Psalm. 101.6. Mine eies shall be vnto the faithfull of the Land that they dwel with me, he that walketh in a perfect way hee shall serue me; and if thou wouldest haue seruants that are vnder thee true and faithfull, then endeauour thou and vse all good meanes to worke the feare of God in their hearts, they are iustly plagued with bad seruants, that care not whether their seruants be religious, or no, no more then for their Oxe or Horse; so that like one of them they bee able and willing to doe their worke; its the complaint of men sometimes, such a one is a very good seruant for paines taking, hee will worke hard, but hee is nimble fin∣gred, he will be pilfring now and then. Now,Note. heere is the cause of it, he wants the feare of God, he is vnfaithfull to God, how then can he be faithfull to men. Labour therefore to plant the feare of God in thy ser∣uant, and then doubtlesse he will doe thee true and faith∣full seruice; yea, then the blessing of God will bee vpon his seruice, and happily on all thou hast for his sake, as it is said, Genes. 39.45. The Lord blessed the Aegyptians house for Iosephs sake; godlinesse is gainefull euen in ser∣uants, and therefore bring thy seruant to the hearing of the word preached, examine him afterwards, instruct him, and giue him good example, and by all other good meanes, draw him to feare God, and thorow Gods bles∣sing, that being once wrought in his heart, thou shalt haue him a good and faithfull seruant.
VER. 23. And whatsoeuer yee doe, doe it hartily, as to the Lord, and not vnto man. The duty of Seruants towards their Masters beeing very hard, and withall no lesse needfull for seruants to per∣forme, the Apostle dwels somewhat longer on it, then on the dutie of any other particular condition of life. Heere therefore in this 23. verse, hee still goes on in his exhortation to the duty of seruants, and doth further lay before them this generall, reaching to all their actions and businesses done in the seruice of their masters, that whatsoeuer they doe therein, they should doe it heartily, and then hee shewes them the meanes, how they may come to doe so, (namely) by doing it as to the Lord, and not vnto men, as if he had said: I exhort you to doe what action or businesse soeuer you doe in the seruice of your masters heartily; and would you know how you may so doe? Heere is the way, whatsoeuer yee performe in the seruice of your masters doe it as a deede and seruice to the Lord, and not vnto men. Interpreta∣tion.(Whatsoeuer yee doe) (that is) what thing, action, worke, or businesse soeuer yee doe in the seruice of your masters, for the Apostle heere speakes of the workes of seruants, as they are seruants, and those are the workes of their Ma∣sters, and that his meaning is so, the word following makes it cleere  worke it, so the word properly sig∣nifies (heartily) the originall word signifies, from the ve∣ry soule, the meaning is, doe it from the heart with good will, so doth the Apostle expound himselfe, Ephes. 6.7. doing the will of God from the heart (saith hee) verse 6. and then verse 7. With good will seruing the Lord and not men, so the one doth expound the other, (as to the Lord and not vnto men) For the vnderstanding of these words, we must know, that euery Master, as he is a Master, hath
his authoritie from God. Rom. 13.1. And hee beares the image of God in his authoritie, and power ouer his seruants; and it is the will of God, that the Master should be ouer his seruant, and commaund him; and that the ser∣uant, should bee vnder his Master, and bee commaunded by him, and obey him. And so the commaundement of the Master (not contrarie to the word of God) carries the stampe of Gods commaundement, and the seruant in o∣baying that, obayes the will of the Lord. These thinges rightly vnderstood, will help vs to the vnderstandinge of these wordes, (as to the Lord, and not vnto men) and shewe that they are thus to bee conceiued; as therin principally seruing the Lord, and not men: or thus, as therin doinge seruice, not simply and barely to men alone, but in them to the Lord, and therin obaying his will. The Master as hee is a Master, bearing the image of God, and standing in the Lordes stead: his commaundement being not contrarie to the worde of GOD, bearing the stampe of Gods com∣maundement. Come wee to the matter of instruction, hence of∣fered: and first, heere wee see, that seruantes are further taught. That they must doe all their workes, in the seruice of their masters, from the heart willinglie:Seruants must doe the workes of their Masters, from their hearts wil∣lingly. whatsoeuer they doe in the seruice of their Masters, bee it greate or small, bee it pleasinge, or displeasinge to themselues, they must doe it from their verie heart and soule. Howsoeuer the seruantes soule be free, and the Master hath not power ouer it: Yet the beginninge of all good seruice, from seruantes to their Masters, is in the heart, and soule: and from thence it must come, and this is not onely cleare from this text, but also from that Ephes. 6.6. Where the Apostle saith to seruantes: bee obedient to your Masters, not as men-pleasers, but as the ser∣uantes of Christ, doinge the will of GOD from the heart.
And the reason and ground of this, is that generall truth that it is no true seruice or obedience either to God or men, that is not willinglie performed, there is a neede full worke of the heart and soule in euerie seruice and du∣tie done, whether to God or men, and if the dutie done, bee either forced or done with a grudging heart, it is no  sound part of obedience, and therefore let all seruants ex∣amine and take account of their owne hearts, in doing the worke, of their masters seruice,Seruants are to examine their hearts in doing the works of their masters. and looke thou doe euery worke thou art set about by thy master willinglie, and from thy very heart and soule, and lay aside all grud∣ging and repining, too common a thing with many ser∣uants, especially if the worke be any whit laborious and wearisome, then many seruants goe about it with an ill will, and with a secret repining in their hearts, and as wee vse to say, as if they had neither life nor soule, take thou heede of this, and know that howsoeuer thy worke so done may bring profit and benefit to thy master, and thou maiest thinke that sufficient, as some stick not to say, haue I not done your worke, and what would you haue more? yet indeed that is not enough, if so be thou desire comfort in thy doing of seruice to thy master, howsoeuer I say, thy deed done may bring profit to thy master, yet beeing done vnwillingly, it will neuer being comfort to thine owne soule, thy worke done vnwillingly, is no more plea∣sing to God then the deede of thy masters horse or oxe; And the application of this may be generall, if wee doe  any good worke or dutie, be it in the immediate worship of God vnwillingly,Good duties done vnwil∣lingly yeeld no comfort to the doer. or after the manner of loaden heauie hearted and drowsie professours, surelie, there is no com∣fort to bee found in the dooing of it, for indeede it is not the dooing, but the readie and cheerefull doing of Gods will, that pleaseth him which wee daily praie for; hee lookes rather to the heart, and to the motion and affecti∣on of the heart in doing any thing then to the thing it selfe, yet so as the thing done bee agreeable to his will,
and a good duty commanded in his word, if any super∣stitious thing bee done it is not pleasing to him, though it be done from the verie heart and soule, and with the grea∣test good intention, and with the greatest deuotion that may bee, the Lord then regards not the heart, and motion of it, but in doing of any good duty, hee rather looks to the heart, and to the affection of the doer then to the thing done, and onely that good dutie is pleasing to him, which is done heartily, euen from the very heart and soule, 1. Corinth. 9.17. and therefore take heede thou be not possessed with a spirit of slumber in doing of anie good thing, that is the character and badge of a carnall and drowsie professour, but labour thou to haue thy heart quickened by grace, that whatsoeuer good thing thou doest either in the immediate worshippe of God, or to thy brethren, thou must doe it with alacritie and cheereful∣nesse and from the very heart roote, as the Apostle speaks Phillippians the first and the eighth, for that is onlie plea∣sing to God. The next thing that comes to be considered is this, the Apostle hauing said to seruants, whatsoeuer ye doe in the seruice of your masters, doe it heartilie, hee addes further (as the meanes whereby they may come to doe so, this consideration, that in doing seruice to their masters, they doe it not barelie to men alone, but in them to the Lord, their masters (as they are masters) bearing the image of God, standing in his steed. Hence seruants are taught. That they must discern the image of God in their ma∣sters,  that they may do willing & hartySeruants must discerne Gods image in their masters that they may serue them willingly and heartily. seruice vnto them, they must consider that their masters are in Gods roome to them, and stand in Christ his stead, as his vicegerents in the familie, and they commanding anie lawfull thing, it is Christ that commands it. Hence it is that the Apostle doth exhort seruants Eph. 6.5.6. to be obedient to their masters as vnto Christ, and
as the seruants of Christ, but heere happily some may say, are wicked and vngodly men,  vnbeleeuers and such as are not members of Christ, being masters in Christ his stead to their seruants? can they that are not members of Christ be in the stead of Christ. Yea, euen they aswell as other masters, who are Godly, religious, and the members of Christ, for we must know that masters stand in the stead of Christ, and bearing the image of God, not as they are good or bad, or thus or thus qualified, bur as they are masters, and haue power & authoritie ouer their seruants, for so they are designed of the Lord to that office, and haue their power from him, and it is his will and ordinance, that they should be aboue their seruants in place and authoritie, and that their ser∣uants, should be vnder and in subection to them, therfore euerie master howsoeuer qualified, yet as hee is a master, hee beares the image of God, and stands in Christ his stead to his seruant 1. Tim. 6.1. saith the Apostle, let as manie seruants as are vnder the yoke, count their masters wor∣thy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrin be not euill spoken of, the Apostle there speakes to seruants that had infidell and vnbeleeuing masters, as may appeare by that he addes ver. 2 And they which haue beleeuing masters &c. there implying that before he spoke to such as had vnbeleeuing masters, & yet he would haue them that had such masters, not to cast off all regard of them, because they were Infidels, but to discerne in them the image of God, and as they were masters, that they stood in Christ his stead, & so to yeeld thē reuerence & obedience, & thus ought all seruants to do, they must discerne the image of God in their masters, and that their masters are in Christ his stead to them, as the ground of all due reuerence, and of all hearty obedience to their masters, and therfore thou that art a seruant looke not thou so much on the out∣ward habit or condition of thy master, nor yet on his qua∣litie good or bad, (though I confesse good things in the master, as holy knowledge & the feare of God appearing in
are to be loued and reuerenced) but yet as thou art his seruant looke not so much at them as at the image of God in his authority and power ouer thee, discerne thou that and let thine eye bee euer vpon that, and that no doubt will be a meanes to make thee doe whatsoeuer thou doest in thy Masters seruice heartily and willinglie, and from thy very heart and soule, as to the Lord himselfe, and not to thy master alone; manie seruants carry themselues rudelie and vnreuerently towards their Masters, as if they were their companions rather then their inferiours, not shew∣ing any token of subiection, not standing bare to their ma∣sters, not bowing vnto them, nor rising vp before them, yea euen in the publique assemblie many of them stand cheeke by cheeke with their Masters, with their hats on their heads, which is vnreuerent behauiour in an high degree. Now heere is the cause of it, they discerne not the i∣mage  of God in their Masters,Reproofe of such seruants as discern not Gods image in their ma∣sters, and ther∣upon faile in their duties towards thē. they looke onelie at the outward appearance of them, which happilie is poore and meane, indeed if rich Masters, or Masters of great place in the world did beare the image of God and poore Masters the image of an Angell or some meaner creature, it were some thing, but thou maist know that thy Master be hee neuer so poore or meane, as hee is a Master beares the i∣mage of God as well as the richest master in the world. Againe, many seruants happilie doe that which they are commaunded by their Masters, but if the thing com∣maunded a little crosse their humour and displease them,Note. they doe it vntowardlie, and with very ill will, and what is the cause of this? whence comes this? surelie from hence; they discerne not the image of God in their Master, they consider not their Masters commanding them any lawfull thing, it is the Lord Iesus in them that commaundeth it, wouldest thou goe vntowardly, and with ill will about thy businesse if the Lord Iesus that hath redeemed thy soule from hell (if thou belong to him) and shall one day come
with glory to iudge the world, were in thy masters place and stead, and did command thee to doe? Oh no, thou wilt say, I would bee most readie and willing to doe anie thing, were it neuer so hard that he should command me, why then consider that thy master stands in the roome of Christ Iesus, and thy master commanding any lawfull  thing, it is hee that commands it in thy master, and if this be duly thought on, and settled in thy mind, no doubt it will make thee doe whatsoeuer thou doest in the seruice of thy master, willingly and heartily; yea, that euery one of vs may yeeld willing subiection and hearty obedience to our superiours, wee must discerne the image of God in them, and consider that they haue their authority and power ouer vs from the Lord,That euery one may yeeld willing subiection and hearty obedi∣ence to his su∣periours, hee must discerne Gods image in their autho∣rity & power. and as they are our gouer∣nours, do stand in the Lords stead to vs. Thus did Dauid discerne in wicked Saul, when he called him the Lords annoynted, 1. Sam. 26.9. and this indeed is the ground of all willing and heartie subiection of anie inferiour to his superiour, then wee shall willingly and heartily doe whatsoeuer lawfull thing is enioyned by our superiours, when wee haue an eie to the image of God in them, and looke on them as standing in Gods stead, and that the o∣bedience and subiection wee yeelde to them, is yeelded not to men alone, but in them to the Lord: yea, to reach out this a little further there is neuer a one of vs, but wee are bound to doe seruice one to another, in duties of loue and mercie, as occasion is offered. Note.Now then consider we, that in doing duties of loue and mercie to our brethren, wee doe them not to men alone, but in them to the Lord Iesus, so himselfe saith plainely, Matth. 25.40. and that will make vs doe them, heartily and willingly. What is the pull-backe? what commonly makes men vnwilling to doe good duties of loue and mercy to their brethren? surely they looke onely at the outward habit or quality of the person, & their own flesh teaching them to
say within themselues, what? shall I be seruiceable to such a base fellow, to one so sordide, so meane, and so ill de∣seruing of mee? these are the thoughts and reasonings suggested by the flesh, and that thou maiest bee able to quell and ouercome them, learne thou to looke thorow them, and to espie vnder the base and meane condition of thy brother a more excellent person, and that in doing a duty of loue and mercie to thy brother, thou doest it not to him alone, but in him to the Lord Iesus: If men did duly consider this, that it is the Lord Iesus to whom they doe dueties of loue and mercie in their brethren, would it not put spirits into them, and make them doe them willinglie and cheerefullie? no doubt it would, and euer will, in all that haue anie true feeling of the comforts in Christ. And therefore euer consider thou to whom the duetie of loue and mercie, is principallie done, euen to the Lord Iesus in thy brother, and that will make thee doe it hear∣tily and from thy very soule, as to the Lord, and not to man alone. Note wee one thing further the Apostle saith to ser∣uants: whatsoeuer yee doe in the seruice of your masters, do that as to the Lord. Hence it is cleare that the meanest thing a seruant doth  in the seruice of his Master is a seruice done vnto the LordThe meanest thing a seruant doth in the seruice of his master is a seruice done vnto the Lord. a seruant in doing the meanest seruice to his Master serues tht Lord as the Apostle saith plainely in the next verse, for ye serue the Lord Christ: heere is a matter of great com∣fort for seruants imploied in mean offices vnder their ma∣sters,Comfort for seruants that are imployed in meane offi∣ces vnder their masters. art thou imploied in thy masters kitchin, as a kitchin boy or mayd? doest thou sweepe the house, wipe shooes,  or performe anie meane office, in the seruice of thy ma∣ster? remember thou to thy comfort, that in so doing thou seruest the Lord, and know that the Lord hath put thee in that office, and submit thy selfe to his will, and serue thy master in it cheerefullie, and with good conscience,
and then though thy imployment and seruice bee base in the eie of the world, yet it is not base in the sight of God, hee esteemes it as good seruice done to himselfe, hee re∣gards it, and will one daie in mercie reward it, and thinke on this to thy comfort. VER. 24. Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receiue the re∣ward of the inheritance: for ye serue the Lord Christ. In this verse the Apostle comes to strengthen his exhor∣tation touching the duetie of seruants before deliuered, and to presse seruants to the practise of it by force of ar∣gument, and to that purpose he heere vseth an argument taken from the rich reward, as it were the wages and hire thereof, which is no lesse then the inheritance of eternall life, which true beleuing seruants shall receiue at the hands of the Lord, as if he had said, be encouraged yeeld obedi∣ence to your masters, and to serue them in singlenesse of heart, and whatsoeuer ye doe in their seruice, doe it hear∣tilie for of the Lord yee shall receiue the reward of the in∣heritance, and this argument the Apostle doth further am∣plifie, first, by their owne certaine knowledge and assu∣rance of it, that they shall receiue such a reward, knowing (saith hee) that yee shall receiue it. And secondlie, by a reason why they are to looke for so great reward at the hands of God; because that in seruing their masters, they serue their Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and hee takes their seruice as done to himselfe, and therefore he (doubt∣lesse) will paie them their reward, and giue them that re∣ward that he hath promised to all his faithful seruants, and so wee see the generall things that are contained in this verse.Interpre∣tation. (Knowing) that is, not by guesse or coniecture, but
certainely, Knowing, you doing your dutie being assured of it, your knowledge being grounded on the promise of God, who is faithfull and iust to performe it (the reward of the inheritance) (that is) eternall life and saluation in Gods kindome of glory. Now that is called both a reward and an inheri∣tance. First, a reward, both by way of similitude, because it is giuen as wages is wont to be giuen to workemen, and la∣bourers at the end of their labours, when their worke is finished, then commonly they receiue their hire and wa∣ges; so when Gods children haue finished their course, and passed thorow the labours and miseries of this life, they receiue eternall life. Whence it is that the Apostle Pe∣ter, 1 Epist. 1.9. saith; They receiue the end of their faith, euen the saluation of their soules. And in this similitude, and resemblance is eternall life cald a reward, and also, be∣cause beeing promised by God to his children, it is duely and iustly rendred to them vpon his promise. And secondly, eternall life is cald an inheritance, be∣cause it belonges, and is, and shall bee giuen to Gods chil∣dren euen to such as are his adopted children in Christ, who hauing receiued the adoption of sons, are the heires of God thorow Christ, as we haue it, Gal. 4.7. and as the A∣postle saith, Rom. 8.17. Being children are also heires, euen the heires of God, and heires annexed with Christ, yea ioint heires with Christ the naturall Son of God, of whose body they are members, and so are heires of saluation, as it is Heb. 1.14. and life eternal is their proper inheritance, and therefore so called in this, and in many other places of Scripture, (For you serue the Lord Christ) that is, in seruing of your masters, you serue not them alone, but in them the Lord Christ, your masters standing in his steede, and the Lord Iesus Christ taks your seruice as done to himself, thus then we are to conceiue the meaning of the Apostle in the words of this verse, as if he had said.
You Seruant doe as faithfull and hearty seruice to your Masters, as you would doe to the Lord, certainly knowing and being assured of it, that you (doing your dutie) when you haue gone thorow the labours of this life, of the Lord yee shall receiue eternall life, and saluation in his kingdome of glory, as the promised reward due to all his faithfull seruants which is an inheri∣tance that he will bestow on you as on his adopted children in Christ, for in seruing of your masters, you serue the Lord Iesus Christ, and hee takes your seruice as done to himselfe. First, we are heere to marke, that the Apostle doth en∣courage seruants to be obedient to their masters, and to serue them in singlenesse of heart, doing euery thing in the seruice of them, as to the Lord, by an argument from the rich reward of their seruice, that of the Lord they shall receiue no lesse then the reward of eternall life. Hence then we may conclude. That Seruants in doing seruice to their Masters may haue an eie to the reward of eternall life;Seruants may haue an eie to the reward of eternall life in doing seruice to their ma∣sters. the Apostle set∣ting this place before them, as an encouragement, that they shall receiue the reward of eternall inheritance; they (doubtlesse) may looke vp to it, and haue respect to it in doing good seruice to their masters. And this is grounded vpon that generall, that in doing good duties, men of any calling or condition may lawful∣ly haue respect to the recompence of eternall reward, as it is expressely said that Moses had, Heb. 11.26. And hence it is that eternall life is proposed and set before vs in the Scriptures, as a price, and as a garland, or crowne, 1 Cor. 9.24.25. And being so resembled, men may haue an eye to it in the performance of good duties. Yet so as they doe not good duties onely, or prin∣cipally
in respect of that reward, we are chiefely to respect Gods glorie and the discharge of our dutie in doing of good duties, and then secondarily, we may minde and respect the recompence of eter∣nall life. And therefore thus may seruants doe, in doing seruice to their Masters, in doing of it, they are principally to minde Gods glory, and the discharge of a good conscience in doing their dutie, and yet therein also may they haue an eie to the promised reward of eternall life, and salua∣tion. And this being so, seruants are (indeed) in doing ser∣uice to their Masters,Seruants are to haue an eie to the great reward of e∣ternall life for their encou∣ragement in doing seruice to their Ma∣sters. to haue an eye to that great reward of eternall life, laid vp and prouided for all those that keepe faith and a good conscience in doing the duties that concerne them, they are to looke vp to that, and euer to fixe the eies of their mindes on it, and that (no doubt) will further and encourage them to doe true and faithfull seruice to their masters; and whatsoeuer they doe in their seruice, to doe it hartily as to the Lord; seruants are of∣tentimes discouraged from doing such seruice as is requi∣red at their hands, from the smallnesse and slendernesse of their wages and reward: and though happily, they re∣ceiue asmuch as was couenanted and agreed vpon, be∣twixt them and their masters, yet because it is but little or they thinke it to little, therefore they take liberty to themselues to neglect their dutie, and to doe but little, and sticke not to say (as the common saying is) if you will mend my wages, I will mend my pace, or to say, what if the seruice I doe be not altogether such as it ought to be, yet it is answerable to the wages I receiue, such seruants as thus speake, and doe, they shew plainely they looke onely to the hand of man, and no higher, and in so do∣ing they deale most foolishly; for they looking onely to the reward they receiue from men, and doing seruice (as they thinke) answerable thereunto, what doe they but
euen depriue themselues of that rich reward, good and faithfull seruants, shall receiue at the hands of the Lord, in comparison whereof, all that seruants doe, or can re∣ceiue from man, be it a thousand pound a day, is not to bee esteemed worth a rush, and therefore looke not thou to the slendernesse of the wages thou receiuest of thy ma∣ster, but let thine eie be euer on the greatnesse of that re∣ward that is yet behinde, no lesse then a kingdome, Math. 25.34. and no lesse then the riches of thy heauenly Ma∣ster, verse 21. A reward infinitely surpassing any seruice thou art able to performe and that (no douht) will make thee lay aside all reasonings of the flesh, as that thy wages are but slender, or thy master is a man, either not deser∣uing a good seruant, or without conscience to reward him, and the like, and it will make thee true and faithfull in the seruice of thy master and to doe whatsoeuer thou dost in his seruice heartily and cheerefully, because thou lookest further then the hand of thy Master, and seest a rich and incomparable reward reserued for thee in a better hand, euen in the hand of him who is able, and will also in his good time bestow it on thee, euer looke thou vp to that rich reward that is laide vp in heauen for all good and faithfull seruants: and consider thou that the Lord of his mercy will crowne thy poore seruice done to thy ma∣ster with no lesse then a kingdome, and with the ioies of his owne euerlasting kingdome; and without question, the consideration of that, will cause thee to passe thorow all difficulties suggested by thine owne flesh, and will en∣courage thee to serue thy master in singlenesse of heart doing whatsoeuer thou doest in his seruice heartily and cheerefully. In the next place wee are to marke the Apostles first amplification of his argument in the wordes of this verse? (Knowing) Hee saith not barely, for of the Lord, he shall receiue the reward of the inheritance, but knowing it, you beleeuing seruants doing your dutie as
you ought in your place and calling, being thereby assu∣red of it, that of the Lord yee shall receiue the reward of the inheritance. Hence we may raise this conclusion. That doing of the duty that ought to be done in any  place or calling faithfully, and with good conscience, it giues assurance to beleeuers that they shall be partakers of eternall life.Faithfull and conscionable doing of du∣ties that ought to bee done doth as∣sure beleeuers of eternal life. The Apostle here saith to beleeuing seruants, be obedi∣ent to your masters, doe you your duty as you ought, cer∣tainely knowing that so doing, yee shall receiue the re∣ward of the inheritance of the Lord. Hereupon we may gather. That by faithfull and conscionable doing of that dutie that ought to be done in any particular place or calling, true beleeuers may certainly know, and be assured that of the Lord they shall receiue the reward of eternall life, and this doth the Apostle further shew in his own exāple most plainely, 2 Tim. 4. where he saith to Timothy vers. 5. Do the worke of an Euangelist, make thy ministry fullie knowne, then hee addes vers. 6. for I am now ready to bee offered, and the time of my departing is at hand; as if he had said, doe thou Timothy that which becomes thee in thy place and calling, faithfully and with conscience, for I haue so done in my place and calling; I haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith, and done my duty faithfully and conscionably, and stood against all opposition to the con∣trary, and now I am ready to be offered and to depart this life: and then marke what he is bold heereupon to inferre and to affirme, verse 8. Henceforth (saith hee) is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day, as if he had said, I haue finished my course and done my duty in my place and calling, and heereby I know, and am assured, that hence foorth is laide vp for mee a crowne of righteous∣nesse.
A plaine proofe of this. That by faithfull and conscionable doing of the duty that ought to be done in any particular place and calling, true beleeuers may be assured that the reward of eternall life belongs vnto them, and that they in time shall re∣ceiue it. And the reason and ground of this is. Because true beleeuers are not onely assured by the infallible testi∣monie of the Spirit of God after an vnspeakable man∣ner bearing witnesse with their spirits that they are the children of God, Rom. 8.16. and so as children, haue right to the eternall inheritance in heauen, but they are also assured of it by the fruits of the Spirit, 1. Iohn 3.14. Wee know we are translated from death vnto life, because we loue the brethren. Loue of the brethren, a fruit of the Spirit, giues assurance of translation from death to life, that men are set out of the state of nature which is dead∣ly, and are now in the state of grace. Now loue to our brethren shewes it selfe and is manife∣sted in doing good to them, as in the generall calling, as we are Christians so in our particular place and calling, in family, Church or Common-wealth, when wee in that particular place and calling, doe the best good wee can to our brethren, we manifest our true loue to them, which is a fruit of the spirit; and therefore, heereupon it must needs follow that by faithfull and conscionable doing of the dutie that concernes true beleeuers in their particular place and calling, by doing it in singlenesse of heart, in o∣bedience to the Commandement of God, with a sincere respect to Gods glory, and the good of their brethren, they may come to certaine knowledge, and assurance, that of the Lord they shall receiue the reward of eternall life,  and this being a cleare point. Confutation of that Popish doctrine that men in this life can onely haue a good hope and no certaine assu∣rance of their saluation.First, it meetes with that desperate and diuellish do∣ctrine of the Papists, who teach their followers euer to stand in doubt of their saluation, and tell them they can
neuer come to anie certaine knowledge and assurance, but at the best, may onelie haue a good hope of it, whereas in∣deed a good and sound hope such as the Apostle speakes of Rom. 5.5. that makes not ashamed euer comes from faith, and faith is a certaine perswasion resting on the free grace and promise of God, and so they confound them∣selues in their owne speech: but being pressed with this and the like places (knowing that of the Lord ye shall re∣ceiue the reward of inheritance, and we know we are tran∣slated from death vnto life because wee loue the bre∣thren. What is their answere forsooth (knowing) heere and in such like places say they signifies a knowledge by signe & by coniecture and not a certaine knowledge,A Popish ca∣uill confuted. which is a meere shift, for the worde is the same with that 1. Iohn 5.20. Where Iohn saith, wee know that the sonne of God is come. Now (I hope) they will not say that our knowledge of Christ his incarnation, and comming in the flesh, is a knowledge by guesse and by coniecture, but a certaine knowledge, they will say they know and beleeue it cer∣tainelie. Now the originall word there, is the same with this heere, and therefore as well in this, as in that place, it signifies a certaine knowledge. Oh but saith the Papist we cannot haue certaine know∣ledge that the reward of eternall life belongs to vs by do∣ing the good dueties the Lord requires of vs because wee may perhaps not haue done them so well as we ought,  we are fraile creatures and wee may haue failed in the man∣ner of doing them, and therefore thereupon wee can haue no certaine knowledge. Indeede if our knowledge and assurance of the reward of eternall life were built on the perfection of good duties done by vs,  we could neuer haue any certaine knowledge of it, but true beleeuers doing good duties in singlenesse and sincerity of heart, in obedience to the Commande∣ment of God, therein seeking Gods glory, and the good
of their brethren, are thereby assured that the promised reward belongs to them, their assurance not resting on the dignity or perfection of their workes, but on Gods free and gracious promise, who hath freely promised in Christ to reward the poore endeauours, and ser∣uice of his children, with the reward of eternall life; and therefore this still remaines a truth, that true beleeuers by faithfull and conscionable doing the duties that concerne them in their particular place and calling, may come to certaine knowledge, that the reward of eternall life belongs to them. And let this be laid vp in the hearts of all true beleeuers as a ground of excellent comfort,A ground of comfort and encourage∣ment to true beleeuers to doe good du∣ties. its not a doctrine of pre∣sumption as the Papists taxt it, but of great comfort and incouragement, euen to hearten vs to the doing of euery good duty, indeede if it were vncertaine, happily we might obtaine the crowne, and happily misse of it, we should haue no heart to seeke after it; but now since it is so that wee beleeuing in Christ, and doing good duties faithfully, and with conscience, may thereby come to a certaine knowledge, that we shall obtaine it: it is a nota∣ble comfort and encouragement to vs, and let all seruants therefore (to them is the encouragement here particular∣ly intended) let them (I say, and all others of what calling or condition soeuer they be, consider how they wrong themselues in the neglect or carelesse doing of good du∣ties that concerne them, they thereby depriue them∣selues of sweet comfort. Art thou a true beleeuer? and dost thou perswade thy selfe that thou dost tru∣ly beleeue in Christ, doe then the duties that concerne thee in thy place and calling faithfully, and with a good conscience, and thou shalt thereby make knowne vnto thy selfe and others, that thy faith is no fancy, and seale vp to thy soule a sweet comfort that the promised reward of eternall life belongs to thee, thou shalt not serue God
in vaine, as the wicked thinke and speake, Malac the 3. and 14. true beleeuers serue not the Lorde for naught, no, no, of the Lord they shall receiue a rich reward, as the wicked heaping sinne vppon sinne, treasure vppe wrath vppon wrath, Romans the second and the fifth, so true be∣leeuers dooing one good dutie after another, lay vppe treasures for themselues in Heauen, Matthew the sixth and the twentieth, euen one degree of glorie vppon ano∣ther: and therefore let vs bee stirred vp with faithfulnesse, and good conscience, to doe the duties that concerne vs in our particular places & callings as the Apostle exhorts,1. Cor. 15.58. bee abundant alwaies in doing holy and good duties, for∣asmuch as wee know certainely that our labour is not in vaine in the Lord. The next thing that comes to bee considered in this verse is this, the Apostle calles eternall life the rewarde of inheritance, he saith, that true beleeuing seruants, shall of the Lorde, receiue the rewarde of the inheritance, and therein hee teacheth two thinges, I will speake of them in order. The first is this. That howsoeuer true beleeuing seruants bee mens bond-men, yet are they the Lords free-men, and howso∣euer they doe seruice to men, yet they are notwithstan∣ding the children of God, and the Lord doth account them not as seruants, but as children,Though true beleeuing ser∣uants be mens bond-men, yet they are the Lords free men, and the Lord accounts them as chil∣dren. for inheritance (as we know) belongs, and is giuen to children, and not to seruants, & that this is a truth, besides this text we haue e∣uidence for it in many other places, 1. Cor. 7.22. the Apo∣stle applying his speech to the comfort of seruants and bond-men, tels them that though they continue seruants yet being in Christ, their case is good, for he that is called in the Lord, being a seruant, is the Lords free-man. 1. Cor. 12.13. the Apostle saith, by one Spirit all beleeuers are baptized into one bodie, they are mēbers of the same my∣stical body of Christ, whether bond or free, & so the adop∣ted sons
and daughters of God, the reason of this is plaine (name∣ly) this. True beleeuing seruants (as they are beleeuers) differ not from other beleeuers, but are all one with them in Christ, as the Apostle saith, Galathians the third and the twenty eight, there is neither bond nor free, but all are one in him, in him they are equall with others in respect of iustification in the sight of God, in respect of adopti∣on to bee the children of God, and in that respect their particular outward difference, as that they are seruants, is not regarded, as either any helpe or hinderance vnto them, as they are beleeuers, as they are in Christ, they are Abrahams seede, and heires by promise, Galathians the third and the twenty nine, they are the children of God, and heires of all the blessings of God in this life, and in the life to come. And therefore true beleeuing seruants (though they be seruants to men) yet for all that they are the children of God, and the Lord doth so esteeme them, as his adopted sonnes and daughters in Christ. Let all true beleeuing seruants lay vppe this trueth in their hearts,  as a ground of sweete comfort vnto them, they may happily at sometime through their owne weakenesse,Comfort for true beleeuing seruants a∣gainst the consideration of their hard and base con∣dition. bee somewhat discouraged, and their minds may bee something cast downe in them, when they looke on their outwarde estate (and as flesh and bloud esteemes it) their harde condition in the world, as that they are not as manie others are, sui iuris, they are not their owne men, but are in subiection vnder others, and at the becke, at the call and command of others, and their condition is seruile and base. But what doest thou troubling and vexing thy selfe with the consideration of thy meane condition amongst men? art thou a true beleeuer? doest thou truelie be∣leeue in Iesus Christ? then sette thy thoughts on that honour thou art called vnto, thou art then the adopted
sonne or daughter of God, fellowe heire with the sonne of the Lorde, and king of heauen; and thou hast right to all the comfortes, of his children in this life: and to his euerlasting inheritance, in his kingdome of glorie. And though thou beest but a seruant to men, yet euen thy seruitude, is sweetned vnto thee, and thou art more then a seruant to the LORD: thou art his sonne through Christ: and therefore thinke on it to thy comfort. Indeede, if thou that art a seruant, bee not a true be∣leeuer, but as yet in thy naturall condition; thou art then in a miserable seruitude: thou art then not onely a seruant to man, but a seruant to sinne, a slaue to the Diuell, and thy seruitude is accursed to thee: and therefore hasten (as much as thou canst) out of that fearefull seruitude, and neuer rest, till thou bee sure thou doest truely beleeue in Christ; and once truely beleeuing in him, it is not thy outward condition (bee it neuer soe base) that can hin∣der thee from beeing the sonne of God. Thou art then his adopted childe, in, and through Christ: and then thou art within compasse, of his speciall loue and fa∣uour, and hast right to all the comfortes of his children, both in this life, and in the life to come. Nowe, the seconde thinge the Apostle teacheth  vs, in callinge eternall life, the reward of inheritance is this. That eternall life, though it bee a reward, yet it is not a rewarde giuen of merite, but of mercie:Eternall life being a re∣ward: is a re∣ward, not of merite, but of mercie. it is a reward freely giuen, and not deserued, being a matter of inheritance. For wee knowe, an inheritance is freelie giuen by the father, to the childe, and not deserued by any me∣rite of welldoinge: it is giuen by the father to the childe, of the meere loue of the father; and it may be it was prouided for him, beefore hee was borne, or beefore hee coulde doe any thinge for it: and soe our Sauiour speakes playnelie of the heauenlie inhe∣ritance.
Matthewe 25.34. In herite the kingdome prepared for you, from the foundations of the world. And euery man that knowes any thinge, knowes thus much, that an earthly inheritance, amongst men, is not giuen to the seruant, who (happilie) hath done some∣thinge, and helped his master, in gettinge, or keeping of it. But it is giuen to the childe, who (it may bee) is soe farre from doeing any thinge, to the purchasinge of it, as that yet hee is an infant, and a suckling. And soe eternall life beeing called, the rewarde of inheritance; wee are thereby giuen to vnderstande, that it is giuen to GODS children, not on any desart of theirs: but freely. Romans. 6.23. It is worth our mar∣kinge, that the Apostle hauinge saide, the wages of sinne, is death. Hee goes not on (as the Rhemists themselues on that place confesse) as the sequell of the speach re∣quired. Hee saith not on the contrarie, the wages or rewarde of holinesse, is eternall life: but hee changeth his tearmes, and saith; but eternall life, is the gift of GOD. A plaine proofe, that eternall life, is not giuen on merite, or desart: but freely of the free grace of GOD: it is the free gift of GOD. And the reason of this, is not onely want of pro∣portion,  beetweene that which wee doe, or can doe, and eternall life. But, because the LORD alone will haue all the glory, of the saluation of his chosen: hee will not haue man to haue any part of that glorie. And therefore the Apostle saith: Ephesians. 2.9. By grace yee are saued through faith, not of workes, least any man should boast himselfe, least any should glorie, that hee bringes any thing to the procurement, of his owne saluation. Wee see then the poynte is prooued. That eternall life, though it bee a rewarde, yet it is not a rewarde, of merite, but of mercie: a rewarde
freely giuen, not deserued by any thing done by vs. First, this serues to confute and ouerthrow the opini∣on  of the Papists,Confutation of the opinion of the Papists touching the merit of workes. who teach that eternall life is properly the reward of good workes, and giuen to them that are first iustified by Christ not gratis and freely but as wages due to their good works, on their desert, and for the merit of them, yea, that God hath set foorth heauen to sale, for our workes, wee finde these very wordes in their writings yea, some of them write thus, that a supernaturall worke, proceeding from grace within it selfe, and of it owne na∣ture hath a proportion, and condignitie with the reward, and sufficient value to bee woorth the same, a doctrine most wicked, and full of derogation from Gods glory, and besides the errour in the foundation of it, supposing a double iustification in the sight of God, which they are neuer able to prooue by the worde of God, it cannot stand with the doctrine now deliuered, and prooued out of the worde of God, for if eternall life bee a reward free∣ly giuen, then not on the desert and dignitie, of any thing done by vs, free gift and due deserued debt cannot stand together. Oh but saith the Papist,  the Apostles worde in this place is  a word that signifies retribution, a ren∣dring one for another, and the English worde (rewarde) supposeth a former pleasure, that is rewarded, otherwise it were to bee called a gift and not a rewarde, and the Greeke and Latine worde  and (mercyes) rather signifie a mans hyre and wages then a gift or a re∣ward. I answer them. The originall word heere vsed, and the Latine and  English word, doe indeed suppose something done, and they haue relation to somthing done that is rewarded, but what then, doth that proue that the reward is giuen for the merit of the thing done? because it is giuen in respect of somthing done, doth it therupon follow, that it is giuen
for the worth and dignitie of it? nothing lesse, they are ne∣uer able thence to euince it, thar is but a loose and disioyn∣ted conclusion. And againe, the Apostle heere not onely vseth the word  or (reward) but hee ioynes to it (of inheri∣tance) thereby giuing vs to vnderstand that the retribu∣tion of heauenly inheritance, is not the rewarde meri∣ted, but the reward promised and freely giuen to Gods children. They further replie and say, the text is plaine Hebr. 6.10. that heauen is the reward merited by good workes, in so much as the authour of that Epistle saith, God should bee vniust if hee rendered not heauen for the same, for God (saith hee) is not vnrighteous that hee should forget your worke and labour of loue, which ye shewed towards his name, in that yee haue ministred vnto the Saints, and yet minister? Answ: In that text there is no such matter, that God should bee vniust if hee rewarded not heauen for the me∣rit of good workes, that can neuer bee thence concluded by anie good forme of reasoning; Indeede God should bee vniust if hee kept not his promise, which is to reward the good workes of true beleeuers, hee hauing freely pro∣mised in Christ to reward the workes of his children, hee hath bound himselfe by his promise to reward them, and if hee should forget so to doe (which is impossible) then hee should bee vniust. And hence it is, that the authour of that Epistle saith, God is not vnrighteous, that hee should forget your worke and labour of loue &c. and so that place makes nothing for the opinion of the Papists, that eternall life is giuen as a rewarde for the meritte of good workes; but it still remaines a trueth, that eternall life is the rewarde of mercie and not of me∣rit. And this being so, that eternal life is a reward of inheri∣tance freely giuen to Gods children.
Wee must looke that wee make title to it, noe other  way, but onely as wee are GODS children: onely as wee are the adopted sonnes, and daughters of GOD in Christ.We must make title to life eternall, only as we are Gods adopted children in Christ. Say not thou (as commonly blinde, and igno∣rant people vse to say) I knowe I must loue GOD aboue all, and my neighbour as my selfe: and if I doe my good will, soe to doe; God will bee mercifull to mee, and I shall goe to heauen: that is to lay claime to heauen as a seruant, not as a sonne: thou must say, when thou hast done all thinges commaunded thee, thou art an vnprofitable ser∣uant. Luke 17.10. Yea, saith the Papist, (heere he puts in his absurd glosse) say soe for humillities sake; though indeede wee are not vnprofitable: a poore shift and a sottish. Wee are taught to say for humillities sake indeed,A popish ca∣uill answered. that wee are vnprofitable seruantes, but not against the truth. Doth our Sauiour teach vs to say, that which is not true, for humillities sake? when hee bids vs say, wee are vnpro∣fitable seruantes. Noe, (without question) hee doth not; wee are to say soe, and in soe saying, wee speake the truth. Wee deserue noe good thinge, by our best workes, at the handes of God: wee are euer to renounce all merrite of our owne workes, and to challenge, or lay claime to hea∣uen, onely, as we are children of God, adopted in Christ, by whose merite wee are justified; and by whose spirite we are sanctified. And yet, we are not heervpon to cast off all care, of doeing good workes: though wee are to dis∣claime, all merite of good workes; yet wee are not to lay a side, the care of doeing of them. Noe, wee are to expresse our thankefullnesse to God, for his mercie, by all holy obedience. If wee are to bee thankefull to GOD, for euerie bitte of breade, wee put into our mouthes (as it is our dutie) because it is the free gift of GOD: and the vse and comforte we finde in it, comes from the blessing of God, then much more are wee to bee thankefull to GOD, for
making vs, that were by nature children of the Diuell, his owne children by adoption, yea sonnes ane heires, euen ioynt heires with Christ his naturall sonne, of that euerlasting inheritance in his owne Kingdome of glo∣rie. And therefore thinke not that now, because wee may not lay claime to life eternall, for the merit of our owne good workes, therefore wee may neglect them, no, no, if thou be a childe of God, the spirit of God will be power∣full in thee to another purpose, then the consideration of thy title by grace to the inheritance in heauen, will make thee say as Dauid did, 2. Samuel the second and the eighteeenth, Lord who am I that thou shouldest thinke of mee, and choose mee, and make mee thy childe by adoption, and giue mee title to thy heauenlie Kingdome, what shall I render vnto thee for this thine vnspeakeable mercie towardes mee, and thou wilt then studdy to shew thy selfe thankefull to God for his mercie in all holie obedience in doing all good duties that con∣cerne thee, and therefore deceiue not thy selfe, if thou feele not this working in thy selfe, thou hast not the spirit of God, and if thou haue not his spirit thou art none of his and if thou bee not his childe, thou hast noe right nor title to his heauenlie inheritance, for onely as wee are sonnes and daughters of God in Christ Iesus, haue wee right to the rewarde of euerlasting inheri∣tance. The second amplification of the argument is in the last wordes (for yee serue the Lorde Christ) this is a rea∣son why seruants are to looke for the reward of inheri∣tance, because that in seruing their Masters, they doe serue the Lorde, yea, hee takes their seruice as done to himselfe. Heere is then comfort and assurance to all true belee∣uing seruants dooing their duetie to their MastersComfort for true beleeuing seruants doing their duty to their masters. that they shall receiue the rewarde of inheritance at the
handes of the Lord for they serue him, and it is iust and equall, that hee to whom the seruice is performed, should pay them their wages, and this the Lord will neuer deny, his word is past from him, his promise is out, and there∣fore doubt not of it, if thou beleeue in Christ, and doe thy dutie to thy Master, the Lord will certainly re∣turne thy good seruice into thy bosome, with his bles∣sing in this life, and will also giue thee the reward of e∣ternall inheritance in the life to come, thinke on it to thy comfort. VER. 25. But hee that doth wrong shall receiue for the wrong that hee hath done, and there is no respect of persons. In this Verse, the Apostle brings a second argument to strengthen and enforce his exhortation touching the dutie of Seruants, and hee doth hearten and encourage them to doe their dutie, and to goe on in the doing of it, by an argument of comfort against the iniuries and wrongs done to them, form a generall sentence; That wrongs done shall one day bee redressed, and that the wrong doer shall receiue for the wrong hee hath done; the LORD will one day repay it with deserued pu∣nishment. In which argument hee preuents a secret obiecti∣on. For happily Seruants (especially in the daies of the A∣postle, when they were bought, and sould, and hard∣lie vsed) might say vnto him; you tell vs that we be∣leeuing in Chirst and doing our duty to our Masters, there is a rich reward abiding for vs, and that of the Lord wee shall receiue the reward of inheritance.
But alas our present condition is intollerable, wee are hardly intreated, and we sustaine great wrong and iniurie, this the Apostle meets withall in this argument, and tels them to their comfort, that one day their wrongs shall be righted, and there will come a time when the Lord will punish the wrong doer, and giue him his iust desert. And this argument is further amplified by the proper∣ty of the Lord in giuing iudgement (namely) this, that he is a righteous and impartiall iudge, not respecting any mans person; in the last words, and there is no respect of persons. And so the summe and substance of this verse is a gene∣rall ground of comfort to all that are oppressed, and suf∣fer wrong, heere particularly applied to seruants, suffering wrong at the hands of their Masters, that one day the Lord will take their cause into his hand, and giue the wrong doer his iust deserued punishment, and that with∣out partiallitie. Come we to the words as they are laid downe by the Apostle. And first of the argument. Interpre∣tation.(But he that doth wrong shall receiue for the wrong that hee hath done) That is, hee that deales vniustly with another (for the word properlie signifieth) He that doth hurt, or harme another, or others; and the Apostle puts these two together, 1 Cor. 6.8. Yee your selues doe wrong, and doe harme, and that to your brethren; and so the meaning is, he that doth hurt, or harme another, or others, in person, goods, or good name: (shall receiue) meaning from the Lord, or from the hand of the Lord. (For the worng that he hath done) the words are (the wrong hee hath done) it is a Metonimicall speech, putting downe the efficient cause for the effect, the meaning is, iust punishment for the wrong done. Thus then briefely conceiue wee these words, as if the Apostle had said.
But he that doth hurt or harme another in per∣son goods, or good name, shall receiue from the hand of the Lord, iust punishment for the same. Now heere in the first place marke wee the argument the Apostle vseth, hauing in the verse before encouraged true beleeuing seruants to doe their dutie to their masters by an argument from the rich reward they shall receiue: heere he addes further encouragement and comfort vn∣to them by an argument from the punishment of such as wrong them, that such as wrong them shall receiue from the Lord iust punishment. In the first place hee comforts them from the rich grace and mercie of the Lord in rewarding their well∣doing. In the second, from his iustice in punishing wrong-doers. Heere then note we. That to true beleeuing Seruants, and indeed, to all true  beleeuers, doing their duties in their places and callings,Both Gods mercy and iu∣stice are com∣fortable to true beleeuers doing their duties in their places and callings. both Gods mercie and also his iustice are comfortable; It is a comfort to Gods children keeping faith, and a good conscience, to consider, that the Lord is both a gracious, a free, and a liberall rewarder of well-doers, and that hee is also a iust auenger and punisher of wrong-doers; Gods children many times finde sweetnesse in the considerati∣on of the iustice of God, I say, many times, not alwaies, yea in the remembrance of his wrath, and iudgements a∣gainst euill doers. Dauid speakes plainely to this purpose, Psalm. 119.52. I remember thy iudgements of olde, O Lord, and haue beene comforted: Hee was staid vp and comfor∣ted in time of his oppression and trouble, by considering the Lords iustice manifested in executing iudgement a∣gainst the wicked; and thus it is with all Gods children,
they with comforte many times consider and remember the iustice of God and his wrath and iudgement on euill doers, and the reason is this. Thereby they know and are assured that the Lord will not suffer the rod of the wicked to rest on them, and that as the Apostle saith, 2. Thes. 1.6. it is a righteous thing with God, it stands with his iustice to recompence tribulation to them that trouble his children, and to them that are troubled, rest and refreshing. Heere is then a manifest difference betweene the chil∣dren of God, and the wicked, there is nothing in God but it is comfortable to his children; euen the consideration of his iustice and that he is a punisher of euill doers is ma∣ny times full of sweetnes to them, but on the contrary the wicked cannot abide at any time to thinke on Gods iusticeDifference be∣tweene Gods children and the wicked when they thinke vpon Gods iustice. and that he is a iust iudge, and punisher of euill doers; no, no, they put the iustice and iudgements of God as far out of their mindes as possibly they can, and they frame to themselues a God all of mercy, and indeede an idoll God; and heereby trie thy selfe, if thou finde that it is euen dreadfull to thee to thinke of Gods iustice and wrath, and that he is a punisher of euill doers, and thou dost labour to stifle all thought and consideration of that, and thou art euer harping on his mercy, and dost frame to thy selfe a God all of mercy, and couldest wish that God were made all of mercy, it is a foule argument thy heart is not right within thee, and therefore remember and thinke on this, that Gods children many times find comfort euen in the consideration of the iustice of God, and that hee is a iust punisher of euill doers, & neuer rest till thou also, at some∣time or other find comfort therein, yea that thou canst with comfort thinke on the iust iudgement that shall bee giuen by the iudge of all the world at his comming, and canst euen wish and pray for that day, and with comfort cry out, as it is Reuelat. 22.20. come Lord Iesus, come quicklie.
Consider wee in the next place the matter of the Apo∣stles argument, hee saith, Hee that doth wrong shall receiue for the wrong that he hath done at the hand of God, iust pu∣nishment. Heere then we see it plainely laid before vs. That the Lord will certainely punish wrong doers,  The Lord wil certainely pu∣nish wrong-doers. such as wrong their brethren, and any way oppresse them, shall not escape the punishing hand of GOD, the LORD will not suffer them that wrong their bre∣thren (except they repent) to goe vnpunished, but they shall certainely receiue iust punishment from his hand. Wee finde Deuter. 32.35. the Lord saith, vengeance, and recompence of wrong from him, is so certaine, as it is laid vp in store with him and sealed vp among his trea∣sures, Prouerb. 22.22.23. saith Salomon, Rob not the poore because he is poore, neither oppresse the afflicted in iudgement. For the Lord will defend their cause, and spoile the soule of those that spoile them. Pro. 23.10. Remoue not the auncient bounds, and enter not into the feld of the Fatherlesse. Vers. 11. For he that redeemed them is mighty: he will defend their cause against thee. 1 Thessal. 4.6. The Apostle exhorts, that no man oppresse, or defraude his brother in any matter, and he giues this reason, for the Lord is the auenger of all such things. And indeed, the reason  and ground of this is, the truth and mercy of God, the Lord is as iust, and as true in his threatnings, as in his promises, and no lesse righte∣ous in recompencing vengeance to euill doers, then in his free and liberall rewarding of well-doers. Let this then strike a terror into the hearts of all  wrong doers,Terror to all wrong-doers. euen into the hearts of all that any way wrong their brethren, of which sort there bee many in the world. Doe not many of our hearts tell vs we are guilty of do∣ing wrong to our brethren?
No doubt the conscience of most men can tell them, they haue done wrong to their brethren, on way or other, ei∣ther in their persons by hard vsage, or in their goods by violence, or fraud, or in their good names, by backbiting, and slandering, and the like, and it may bee more waies then one; well, consider thou, that for the wrong thou hast done, or dost, to thy brethren, there is punishment and vengeance laide vp in the hands of the Lord for thee, and it is laid vp in a sure hand, euen in the hand of him, who will be sure to finde thee out, and vnlesse thou in time doe truely humble thy selfe, and repent, will bee sure to poure it downe vpon thee, and thou shalt not escape it; and thinke not, because (happily) thou art a man of place, and power, and thy poore vnderling oppressed and wronged by thee, dare not complaine, or open his mouth to men against thee, therefore thy ease is good e∣nough: no, no, howsoeuer the poore worme troden vp∣on, dare not open his mouth, yet the sinne it selfe opens a wide mouth against thee, it cries loud, and makes a loude crie in the eare of the Lord, Isai. 5.7. I looked for iudge∣ment, but behold oppression, for righteousnesse, and behold a crying. Oppression and wrong-doing is a crying sinne, and it will neuer rest till it bring downe iudgements, sometimes it brings downe visible iudgements in this life, though not alwaies, 2 Pet. 2 9. The Lord reserues the vniust vnto the day of iudgement to be punished; Yea, though the Lord re∣gard not the persons, or praiers of wicked men oppressed, and iniuriously dealt withall, yet hee many times, regards their cause, and hee heares their oppression and wrong crying to him, and will punish the wrong-doer. Yea, know wee yet further, that though wrong done by thee, be forgiuen by the partie, and hee praies for thee as Ste∣phen did, Act. 7 60. Lord lay not this sinne to their charge, yet till thou thy selfe bee truely humbled and repent of thy sinne, thou standest liable to punishment, the Lords
iustice will not suffer wrong to escape vnreuenged: thinke on this thou that art guilty of wrong doing heeretofore, and let euery one of vs euer heereafter take heede of so foule a sinne. Againe, is it so that the Lord will punish wrong doers,  and not suffer them to escape his punishing hand, heere is then a sweet comfort for such as are wronged any way, and can haue no releefe nor remedy at the hands of men,Comfort for such as are wronged and can find no reliefe nr re∣medy at the hands of men they must remember that howsoeuer men regard them not, nor haue any care to see their wrongs righted, yet the Lord that sees all things, he sees them, and hee re∣gards them, and he will one day reuenge them. Art thou a child of God that art wronged?Note. heere is then double comfort for thee, thy well-doing shall re∣ceiue reward, and thy suffering wronges shall finde a re∣uenge, and therfore thou aboue al other, possesse thy soule in patience, commit thy cause to him that iudgeth iustly, and take heed thou neuer goe about to auenge thy selfe, it is the Apostles exhortation, Rom. 12.19. Dearely beloued, auenge not your selues, but giue place vnto wrath: for it is written, vengeance is mine I will repay, saith the Lord: and it is built on this very ground, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, if thou seeke to auenge thy selfe, thou incroachest on the Lords right, and then thou wrongest thy selfe, and prouokest the Lord to displeasure against thy selfe. May I not seeke remedy and redresse of my wrongs at the handes of the Magistrate, and at the hands of such as are set in place to right wrongs? Yes: (doubtlesse) thou maiest for great wronges,  such as endanger thy life, or state, thou maiest seeke redresse at the hands of the Magistrate; but yet in seeking law∣full remedy, remember still thou carry a meeke minde, be farre from all desire of reuenge, and if thou finde no redresse at the hand of the Magistrate, but thou art fur∣ther wronged and oppressed to the losse of goods, yea of life it selfe, yet still commit thy cause to the Lord, and
the reuenge of it to him, and hee (doubtlesse) will giue the wrong-doer (if hee continue in his sinne) his iust deserued punishment, bee he neuer so great, or mighty, a sweete comfort for all poore wormes oppressed by the mightie men of the world. Art thou a seruant (for to thee did the Apostle chieflie intend this comfort) and art thou wronged by an heard dealing master? Remember thou, God sees thy wrong, and he will one day auenge thy wrong, if thou commit it to him in godly patience, indeed if thou take on thee to a∣uenge thy wrong thy selfe, thou dost then loose the be∣nefit of Gods regard, and thou shalt surely taste of his rod for so offending. But if thou in patience possesse thy soule, and commend thy cause to him, certainely the Lord will one day set thee at liberty, auenge thy cause, and ren∣der vengeance into the bosome of those that wrong thee. Come wee to the amplification of the Apostles argu∣ment in the last word of the verse, (And there is no respect of persons.) Wherein hee sets downe the propertie of the Lord in giuing iudgement, that hee is a iust and most im∣partiall iudge, and that with the Lord there is no respect of persons, for so the sentence is to bee supplied, as wee haue it expressely set downe, Rom. 2.11. Ephes. 6.9. and in many other places. Interpreta∣tion.(And there is no respect of persons.) The words proper∣lie signifie no respect of face, or of outward appearance, for the originall word () signifies the face, or out∣ward shew, we finde it so rendred, 2 Cor. 5.12. Which re∣ioice in the face and not in the heart; and so by the word (person) we are to vnderstand the outward quality, or the outward state, and condition of man, euen that in man which is conspicuous, and to bee discerned by others, which doth commonly make him more, or lesse esteemed amongst men as country, sexe, state of life, as that he is a Father, a Master, a Seruant, &c. riches, pouertie, wis∣dome,
learning &c. and not to respect the person in iudge∣ment, is not to bee mooued, or carried thorow any par∣tiall affection towardes any, or from anie, in regard of his outward quality and condition, either to spare anie, be∣cause of his dignity and preserment aboue others in the world, or to pitty another because of his inferioritie and low estate amongst men, but to giue iust iudgement ac∣cording to the cause and workes of euery one: thus then conceiue we the meaning of these words, as if the Apostle had spoken more largely thus. And in giuing of iudgement there is no regard with the Lord of the outward quality or state of any man, hee will not spare any in respect of his outward dignitie and state in the world, neither will hee pitty any in regard of his meane quality and condition amongst men, but hee will iudge euerie one, high or low, rich or poore, vprightly according to his workes.. First, heere wee see plainely layd before vs, the absolute righteousnesse of the Lord in giuing iudgement, that hee will giue iust iudgement to euery one, not regarding the outward appearance or condition of the person whatsoe∣uer, to peruert iudgement. And hence it is, that the Apostle cals the last iudge∣ment,  the declaration of the iust iudgement of God,God will giue iust iudg∣ment to euery one, not re∣garding the outward con∣dition of the person. Rom. 2.5. and then hee goes on further to shew the iustice of God in giuing iudgement, that hee will reward euerie man according to his workes (that is) to them which by continuance in well doing, seeke glory, and honour, and immortallitie, eternall life, &c. and hee giues this selfe same reason of it, vers. 11. for there is no respect of per∣sons with God, and this vprightnesse in giuing iudgement
Without partiallitie, is signified by the white Throne, spoken of Reuel. 20.11. For the white coulour in scrip∣ture, is vsed to represent purity, and glorie: and in that place, it signifies, that the Iudge, shall giue most just, and vncorrupt judgement, and free from all spotte of par∣tiallitie. And the reason of this is manifest (namely) this, the most holy, and glorious majestie of God, is free from all sinister,  and corrupt affection. Hee is most just and pure, yea, justice & puritie it selfe: and those things which often times, carry earthly Iudges awry, & cause them to swarue in judgement, and to respect persons, are not found in the Lord: earthly Iudges many times respect persons, and are partiall, for feare of the mightie, or for loue of friends, or hatred of enimies, or the like. Nowe these corrupt af∣fections, are not in the Lorde, and therefore hee will cer∣tainely, giue just judgement, not sparinge or pittying any, in respect of outwarde quallitie, or condition. Iob. 34.19. Hee accepteth not the persons of Princes, and re∣gardeth not the rich, more then the poore: for they bee all the worke of his hands. But against this, happily, some may object, and say. Wee reade Matthewe 11.22. our Sauiour saith, it shalbe easier for Tyrus and Sydon, at the day of judgement, then for them of Corazin and Bethsaida. And againe, for the land of Sodome, then for Capernaum, at the day of judg¦ment: vers. 24. and hee giues this reason of it. Because many greate workes were done, in those places: their out∣ward condition was better, in regarde of their outwarde meanes of repentance. Capernaum, was lift vp to heauen, in regarde of the preaching of Christ, and his workinge of miracles there. And againe, Luke. 12.47.48. hee saith, the seruant that knewe his Masters will, and prepa∣red not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shallbe beaten with many stripes: but he that knewe it not, and yet did committe thinges worthie of stripes, shallbee
beaten with few stripes. Where wee see (may some say) iudgement shall be giuen according as men doing things worthie stripes are quallified, either with knowledge or ignorance, and therefore it may seeme, that the Lord at the day of iudgement will respect persons, and regard the outward quality and condition of men. For answer to this,  wee must know that indeede some qualities or outward conditions doe aggrauate or lessen sinne, and doe make it greater or lesse, as (no doubt) the Ministers sinne is greater in respect of his calling, thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe? thou that preachest a man should not steale, doest thou steale, Rom. 2.21. the Magistrates sinne is greater in regard of his place and authority, hee hauing charge of the Law, and being keeper of both the tables of Gods Law, thorow breaking the Law, doth more in that respect dishonour God, and the priuate mans sinne is distended and made greater, by the common good meanes, and personall good gifts God hath vouchsafed him, and iudgement, and punishment without repentance is like to bee answe∣rable, the Lord will giue iudgement and punishment ac∣cording to the sinne, and reward a greater or lesser de∣gree of punishment, as the sinne is greater or lesse, in respect of the quality and condition of the impenitent sinner. But what then, is the Lord an accepter of persons in iudgement? nothing lesse, for to accept persons in iudge∣ment, is thorow a corrupt and partiall affection, in re∣spect of the person, to peruert iudgement, and to giue wrong and vniust iudgement. Now the LORD is farre from this,What it is to accept persons in iudgement. in giuing and awarding greater or lesse punishment, as the sinne is greater or lesse, not onely in the kinde or nature of the sinne it selfe, but in regarde of the qualitie or condi∣tion of the sinner. Therein the Lord deales most iustly, and is farre from
all touch of partiality, hee is not mooued by the quality or condition of the person to spare or pittie any vniustly, but hee will giue iust and proportionable iudgement and punishment to euerie one, liuing and dying in sinne, ac∣cording as his sinne shall bee, euen greater or lesse, and yet euer iust in regard of his qualitie and condition, and so it still remaines a truth, that the Lord will giue iust iudgement to euery one, and not accept any mans person in regard of his outward quality and condition to peruert iudgement. Let this then in the first place teach euery one of vs to take heede how wee rest on any outward quality or con∣dition, as able to stand vs in steade, in the great daie of Gods iudgement,We must take heed we rest not vpon any outward con∣dition, as able to stand vs in stead in the day of iudge¦ment. yea, or as a meanes to mooue the LORD to spare vs, or to pitty vs, and not to award iust sentence and iudgement against vs for our sinnes. Is there any so vnwise, as to thinke that his outwarde state and condition in the world, shall doe him any good when hee comes to stand before the the tribunall and iudgement seat of the Lord? I make no question but euen all that bee of any yeeres and discretion, hauing liued in the bosome of the Church, and a long time vnder the meanes of knoweledge, are conuinced in conscience of this truth, & will confesse it to bee a truth, that at the day of iudgement, no outward state or condition shall stand any man in stead, to free him from the iust iudgement of the Lord, and that the Lord will not then regard the rich more then the poore, nor the great men and Prince, more then the meanest Subiect. But yet I must tell you there be two sorts of people that (notwithstanding this confession) presume the Lord will deale fauorably with thē in respect of outward things the one
sort are carnall professours, and the other are ignorant persons, for the first of these, doe not many persons think that because they are borne and brought vp in the bosome of the Church, they haue beene baptized and made par∣takers of the holy ordinances of God▪ therefore the Lord will bee mercifull vnto them, and not giue sentence of condemnation against them, they shall neuer come into the iudgement of condemnation, though their hearts and liues abound with fowle sinnes. And againe: Doe not many ignorant persons thinke that the Lord will hold them excused, and not deale with them accor∣ding to their sinnes in respect of their ignorance? euen because they are ignorant, therefore the Lord will hold them excused? indeede ignorance that is not voluntarie, shall excuse not altogether from sinne, but from so great sinne, but ignorance wilfull and affected, such as is the ignorance of them who liue vnder the meanes of know∣ledge, doth rather aggrauate and encrease sinne, then any thing mitigate or lessen it. And therefore deceiue not thy selfe, and let euery one take heede how hee presumes that the Lord will bee fa∣uourable to him, and hold him excused, because hee hath the outward calling of a Christian, or because hee is igno∣rant, remember this, that the Lord is no accepter of per∣sons, he in giuing iudgement will not spare, nor pitty thee in respect of thy outward quality or condition, no, no, that shall then stand thee in no stead, vnlesse it bee to heape vp iudgement vppon thee, and neuer rest thou, till thou be sure that thou art a liuely member of Iesus Christ, in him alone thou shalt bee accepted, and be able to stand  with comfort before the Lord,Comfort for poore soules oppres∣sed by great men in the world. at his comming to iudge∣ment. Againe is it so, that the Lorde at the daie of iudge∣ment, will giue iust iudgement, not accepting anie mans person whatsoeuer, nor regarding the outwad
state of any man, heee is then further comfort for poore soules oppressed by great men in the world, the Lord will not onely one day punish their oppressours (vnlesse they repent for their oppression and wrong, but he will doe it without all partiality, and without all respect of persons, their greatnesse shall not stand them in stead to beare off the stroake of the Lords punishing hand; no, no, they shall appeare before the Lord as naked and voyd of all great∣nesse, as the poorest man in the world; let all that suffer wrong and hard measure at the hands of great ones, think on that to their comfort. In that the Apostle saith, the Lord is no accepter of persons in iudgement, this pointeth out the duetie of all those that beare the image of God in any publike place of authoritie either in Church or Common-wealth, they are to bee like to the Lord in iudging without respect of persons,Such as beare Gods image in any place of authority, are to b like the Lord in udg∣ing without respect of per∣sons. as the Prophet saith, Isai. 28.17. they must laie iudgement to the rule, and righteousnesse to the ballance, they must heae causes indifferently, and determine them equally, examining them (as it were) by line and square (as the Mason or Carpenter doth his worke) they must beware of fauouring the great ones for their greatnesse, which is to decline on the left hand, and of pitying, and in pittie fauouring the part of the poore, and meaner sort, in respect of their low degree, and howsoeuer that may be thought a vertue, euen by men wise and well minded, yet that it is a fault and sinne, the text is plaine Exod. 23.3, Leuit. 19.15. wee there finde it expresselie forbidden, to respect the poore man in his cause or question of strife, and thus farre may this concerne vs, wee are called some∣times to vmpire and iudge of matters of difference be∣tweene parties, and therein we must take heede we be not corruptly carried with any partiall affection in respect of the qualitie of any party to iudge amisse. Wee must looke to the cause, and lay aside all sinister
respect of persons, yea, euerie one of vs are to be guided by this rule in iudging of sinne,We are to iudge of sinne without re∣spect of per∣sons, and therein many are faulty. it is the fault of the most to iudge that to bee sinne in some, which they deeme not so in others; for example, manie will iudge and condemn that as couetousnesse, or pride, or garishnesse, setting out the lightnesse and vanitie of their minde in strangers, which they will not so iudge and so condemne, if it bee found in their owne neare friendes, as in wife, childe, father, mother, kinsmen, and such like, as though diuer∣sity of subiect could make the selfe same thing a sinne in some, and not in other some, and yet thus it is with many in the world; and what is this, but as Iames saith chap. 2.4. to bee partiall in our selues and iudges of euill thoughts, that is, iudges ill affected, carrying in vs, peruerse and crooked thoughts, and iudging in respect of persons; thou must iudge sinne to bee sinne, and condemne it though it bee neuer so neerely resident and found in thy dearest friends, and if thou doe not so,Note. surely thou hast neither a true dislike and hatred of sinne, nor a true loue of thy friendes, for a true dislike of sinne will make thee dislike it wheresoeuer it is found, and hee loues his friend true∣ly, that hath learned to loue him or her spiritually, and cannot abide sinne in the party loued without some sea∣sonable admonition and reproofe. And therefore, if wee would not shewe it, that wee haue no true dislike of sinne, euen because it is sinne, and displeasing to God, nor anie true loue of our friendes (which wee woulde bee loth that anie shoulde thinke of vs.) Let vs learne to iudge and condemne sinne in whom∣soeuer it is found, without respect of persons, yea, iudge and condemne a sinne to bee as great a sinne in thy nee∣rest friende, as in anie other whosoeuer, and that will seale vppe sweete comfort to thy soule, that thou hast thee spiritte of God in thee, transforming thee,
into the image of God, & as that thou art like the Lord in this worlde, so thou shalt bee like to the image of his sonne Iesus Christ, in the world to come. Amen. VERITAS FILIA TEMPORIS
THE FOVRTH CHAPTER. VERSE I. Yee Masters, doe vnto your Seruants that which is iust and equall, knowing that yee also haue a Master in heauen. IN this first verse of this Chapter, the Apostle doth still continue his exhortation, begunne verse the 18. of the foregoing Chap∣ter, containing speciall dutes of Christians, as they stand in relation one to another, in some particular state and condition of life, and hauing before pro∣pounded, and vrged the dutie of Seruants towards their Masters. Heere hee sets downe on the other side, the dutie of Masters towards their Seruants; and he tels Masters, here be two things required of them towards their seruants; as (namely) that they doe to their seruants.
That which is iust. And That which is equall. And these two things, the Apostle doth vrge on Ma∣sters by way of exhortation, generally propounded in these words (Yee Masters doe to your Seruants that which is equall.) And then hee strengthens this exhortation, and moues masters to the doing of these two things, by force of argument, and that taken from their subiection to an higher Lord and Master. That they are not absolute Masters, and subiect to none, but that they also haue a Master aboue them, to whose censure they are subiect, and to whom they must one day yeeld an account (as of all their doings) so of their dealings with their Seruants. And this argument the Apostle doth amplifie. First, by their own knowledge, (or at least, they ought to know, and consider it) Knowing (saith the Apostle) that yee also haue a Master. And then, by setting downe what Master it is they haue aboue them (namely) not an earthly, but an hea∣uenly Master And so the generall things before vs in this Verse, are these two. First, a generall exhortation to Masters to doe to their seruants, that which is iust and equall. Secondly, a reason to strengthen that exhortation, and to presse these duties on them (namely) this, because Masters know (or at least, ought to know) that they are not absolute Masters, and subiect to none, but haue also an heauenly Lord and Master aboue them, to whose cen∣sure they are subiect, and to whom they must one day render an account. Of these two things in order. Interpre∣tation.What we are to vnderstand by Masters and Seruants we heard before in the 22. Verse of the foregoing Chap∣ter, (namely) such as are masters according to the flesh,
and such are seruants for wages, terme of yeeres, or how∣soeuer. (Doe) the word properly signifies, exhibite, or yeeld▪ (that which is iust) that is, that you are bound vnto, and of right ought to yeeld vnto them, and cannot deny them, vnlesse you deale vniustlie with them; (and equall) that is, that which is meet and fit for you to yeeld to them euen that which it beseemeth you to yeeld to them, in regard of equity, piety, and a good conscience. Thus then conceiue the meaning of this exhortation. You that are Masters according to the flesh, yeeld to your Seruants, that you are bound vnto, and of right ought to yeelde vnto them, vnlesse you will doe them wrong, and deale vniustly with them, and that also that becommeth you to yeeld to them, e∣uen in equity, piety, and good conscience. Now, first the duty of Masters towards their seruantsThe dutie of masters to∣wards their seruants. heere expressed comes to be further considered. In handling of it, I will first lay foorth the particulars wherein the iust dealing of Masters towards their seruants consisteth. First, the particular things which Masters are of right  to yeeld to their Seruants. Secondly, the speciall things wherein stands their e∣quall  dealing with their seruants; and what bee the par∣ticulars that Masters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equi∣tie and good conscience. Thirdly, I will shew the extent of the dutie touching  the persons, (namely) who bee the Masters that are to deale iustly and conscionably with their Seruants. And then after some examination, I will bring some  motiues to stirre them vp whom this dutie concernes to the practise of it. First therefore, know we, that Masters are of right to yeeld to their seruants three things, their iust dealing with their Seruants stands in three things.The iust dea∣ling of masters with their ser∣uants stands in 3. things.
First, in requiring of them, not onely lawfull things, but things proportionable to their power and strength. For as the Master must looke, that none of his seruants be idle, so he must see that none of them bee oppressed; if either of these things come to passe, that the Seruant bee ouerburdened, or idle, it is a fault in the Master, and hee dealeth not iustly with his Seruant. Salomon saith, A righ∣teous man, a iust dealing man, regardeth the life of his beast,Prou. 12.10. hee will not load his poore dumbe beast, with too heauie burdens, but hee regardeth the life and strength of it: Much more ought a master to regard the life and strength of his seruant, and accordingly to proportion out his businesse and worke. Secondly, Masters are of right to yeeld to their Ser∣uants prouision of meate, drinke, and cloathing, or com∣petent wages to prouide the same, and that they haue their meate, drinke, and wages in due season; for that, the law of God, the law of nature, and the law of nations, and cu∣stome among all men; yea, among the very heathen re∣quires: and it is a iust thing, Seruants being men like to their Masters in flesh and blood, they must bee sustained by earthly things, for their labours sake, and therefore our Sauior saith, the workman is worthy of his meate (that is) of all necessaries for the maintenance of this life. In the description of a good huswife wee reade,Mat. 10.10. that shee riseth whiles it is yet night, and giueth the portion to her hous∣hold, and the ordinarie to her maides; though shee raise vp her seruants betimes to worke,Prou. 31.15. yet shee is not cruell toward them, but giues them their foode in due season. Shee feares not the snow for her family, for all her fami∣ly is cloathed with Scarlet,21. or with double, &c. shee prouides warme and thicke cloathes for her seruants that they may be defended against the extremity of cold. Thirdly, masters are of right to yeeld to their seruants, iust censure and correction for their faults, they must not censure and correct them without iust cause, or exces∣siuely,
but they must proportion out their admonitions, rebukes, and chastisments, according to the offences of their seruants, and to that ende, they must wisely consi∣der the nature and qualitie of the offence, and of light, and small offences, and little ouersightes, not to tak notice. Giue not eare to all the words that men speake,Eccles. 7.23. lest thou heare thy seruant cursing thee. This reason is giuen of it. For often times thine heart knoweth that thou hast cursed others:Vers. 24. thine owne heart can tell thee, thou hast spoken as bad words against thy betters, and if the fault bee greater, deseruing admonition, or rebuke, or correction, to measure it out according to the nature and qualitie of it; hee must also consider, how often, or seldome, the Seruant hath fallen into that fault, and whether hee will bee bettered by word onely, or no, and if hee finde, that hee will not bee chastised with words alone, Though hee vnderstand, yet will not answer, as it is Prouerb. 29.19. then to vse further chastisement. And hee must euer take heede of passion in time of his censure, that he neither rebuke nor correct his seruant in rage and passion, for that will certainely carry him be∣yond iust measure, but hee must doe it in compassion euen mourning in his heart for the sinne of his seruant, with desire to helpe him out of it. And these three things spoken of are the particu∣lars, that Masters are of right to yeelde to their Ser∣uants. Now in the second place, the speciall things that Ma∣sters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equity and consci∣ence, are these three.There be 3. speciall things that masters are to yeeld to Seruants in e∣quity & con∣science. That is, First, moderate rest from their labours, lawfull recrea∣tion, without which seruants cannot continue with any  cheerefulnesse in the duties of their callings; and hence it is often said in the Lawe that thy seruant and hand∣maide may rest as well as thou.Exod. 23.12. Deut. 5.14. Especially Ma∣sters
are bound in equity and eonscience to giue their ser∣uants liberty to sanctifie the Sabbath, and to keep an holy rest to the Lord on his day, both publikely and priuate∣ly; for they being created and redeemed as well as their masters, are as highly endebted to the seruice and wor∣ship of God as their Masters, this is plainely expressed in the fourth Commandement. The second speciall thing that masters are to yeeld to their Seruants in equitie and conscience, is a supply of things needfull (according to their ability) in time of their seruāts sicknes, when the seruant is vnder the hand of God by sickenesse, the master must prouide (as he is able) all good meanes that serue for his health and recouery, and that he may haue good vsage in time of his weakenesse, and not cast him off at large, as the Amalakite did the poore Aegiptian,1. Sam. 30.13. being sicke in the field. And the Master may not defraude his seruant when he is sicke, of things need∣full, neither may he abridge him of any part of his wages, for the time of his sickenesse; because the seruant is not then restrained from working by his owne negligence, but by the hand of God, and it may bee, hath gotten his sickenesse by his faithfull paines taking in his masters ser∣uice; and therefore his master in equitie is bound to re∣leeue him with things needefull, and to giue him his full wages agreed on betweene them at the first. The last speciall thinge that Masters are to yeelde, to their seruants in conscience, is, according to their power, some further recompence, ouer and aboue their wages, when they depart from them, according to the good and long seruice they haue done them. Deut. 15.13.14.The Lord commanded, that when there was a manu∣mission, a free sendinge out of seruantes: they should not let them goe away emptie, but that they should giue them a liberall reward, of that the Lord had blessed them withall, by their seruice. Howsoeuer, that lawe was one of the judicialls belonging to the Iewes regiment: yet the e∣quitie
of it, is perpetuall, and belonges to vs, and to our posteritie for euer. And wee see then what are the speciall thinges, that Masters are to yeeld to their seruants, in equi∣tie and conscience. Nowe, for the third thing propounded (namely) who bee the Masters, that are to deale thus justlie, and consci∣onablie, with their seruants,All masters are to deale iustly & con∣scionably with their ser∣uants. that is laide downe in the first word (Masters) The Apostle speaking indefinitely, hee giues vs to vnderstand, that this dutie belonges to all Ma∣sters whatsoeuer, without exception, of what state, calling, or condition soeuer they be: and let not any man thinke that his greatnesse in place and calling, or his meane con∣condition can dispence, with the neglect of any of the forenamed particulars. And let all masters trie and exa∣mine themselues touching the duties deliuered, and lay their practise to the rule: and if they so doe, where is the Master to be found that can cleare himselfe, and can iust∣ly say, hee hath not failed in his dutie towards his ser¦uants: and to passe by them that faile of infirmitie,Reproofe of such masters as faile in du∣tie towards their seruants. and a∣gainst their purpose, are there not many Masters that faile wittingly and willingly? Are there not some who are so farre from yeelding that which is iust and right to their seruants, as that many waies they wrong them with hard and cruell seruices, with burdens too heauy, with stripes too many, and which is barbarous, and sauoureth of cru∣eltie, pinch them in their foode? Doe they not (as we vse to say) both backe-beate them, and belly-beate them? And are there not some who are euer finding fault with e∣uerie trifling ouersight? and if the fault bee greater, are there not some who are so farre from considering the na∣ture and qualitie of the offence, and from griefe and com∣passion in correcting, as they fall on their seruants in a rage and violent passion, rate him, and beate him most vnrea∣sonably? And if we looke to things that are to be yeelded to seruants in equity and conscience, how doe many Ma∣sters therein come short of their dutie? Doe they not de∣nie
their Seruants moderate rest and correction, vnlesse on the Lords day when they should bee otherwise exerci∣sed? Then they can be content their seruants should haue free libertie to recreate themselues, wherein it doth more harme to their soules, then good to their bodies. And do not some Masters abridge their seruants of libertie to san∣ctifie the Sabbath? yea, doe they not of a couetous minde compell their Seruants, happily well minded, euen against their wils to breake the Sabbath, and to doe the ordinarie workes of their callings? And is not a vsuall thing for Masters to cause their seruants, almost euery Sabbath to tarrie at home, to dresse meate, and to make readie their dinners, and so indeede, they eate the flesh, and drinke the bloud of their Seruants? And are there not many Masters, who are so farre from recompencing the good seruice of their seruants with some thing ouer and aboue their wages, as many times they stay their wages for their siknesse, or for something they pretend, they haue lost, or some damage they receiued by them? Where is almost a Master that doth carefully prouide things needefull for his seruants in time of sickenesse? Nay, doe not many Masters murmurre and grudge at it, that the poore sicke seruant eats and drinkes, and doth nothing but spend and burden the family, and if they can by any meanes, they will packe him out of the house, and if once they get him out, neuer after regard him; these and the like, are the dea∣lings of many masters, and gouernours towards their seruants. Therefore thou being a Master trie thy selfe by the things now laid before thee,Masters are to try themselues by the things before deli∣uered. that finding thy selfe defe∣ctiue and short of that dutie thou oughtest to performe to thy seruants; bee humble for that sinne, it is a sinne a∣gainst thy personall calling, and therefore a greeuous sin, and so long as thou doest liue in that sinne thou canst haue no true peace in thine owne conscience, nor any assurance of Gods speciall potection ouer thee.
Therefore humble thy selfe, and betimes repent of that sinne, and now knowing thy duty, learne euer heereafter to make conscience of it; and to helpe thee forward, con∣sider further these three things.Three mo∣tiues to stirre vp masters to deale iustly & equally with their seruants. First know that if a master deale vniustly or vnequally with his seruants, hee doth exceedingly prouoke the Lord to anger and heauie displeasure against him: vniust or vnequall dealing with seruants is a crying sinne, it calles for vengeance. Beholde the hire of the labou∣rers (who are seruants for the time) which haue rea∣ped your fieldes (which is of you kept backe by fraud) crieth,Iam. 5.4. it maketh a lowd crie in the eares of the Lord of hoasts. We finde a fearefull threatning denounced against this sinne. The King Zedekiah and the people, had made a couenant to proclaime liberty,Iere. 34. from 8. ver. to 17. that euerie man should let his seruant goe free, and euery man his hand-maid, which was an Ebrue or an Ebruesse, and that none should serue himselfe of them, and they afterward repented, and caused the seruants and the hand-maids whom they had let goe free, to returne and hold them in subiection as seruants and hand-maids, ver. 11. Then followeth the threatning & a fearfull speech, vers 17. ye haue not obeyed mee, in proclai∣ming freedome euery man to his brother and euery man to his neighbour, behold I proclaime a liberty for you saith the Lord to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you a terror to all the kingdomes of the earth. An heauie sentence, and to be thought on with trembling of all that deale vniustly and vnconscionably with their seruants, in deed vniust dealing with seruants is a sin so displeasing to the Lord, as in some case it is not sufficient for a master to be humbled for that sinne, and to make confession and ac∣knowledgement of it to God, though with salt teares, and much griefe of heart, but hee must also make some sa∣tisfaction to his seruant, Exodus 21.26.27. wee finde that a Master for pulling out his poore seruants eye
or smiting out his tooth, must not content himselfe with saying I am sorry for it. Or being truely greeued for it, but he must giue his seruant his libertie and freedome for it,Note. for the rule is true, wrong in deede must be recompenced indeed with some reall recompence, otherwise the Lord accepts not of any humiliation for it, which is a thing little thought on by manie masters, who in their rage, beat their seruants or cast things at them, euen what comes next to hand, to the wounding or laming of them, and then thinke it enough to say, I am sorry, I was too rash, I wish, I had not done it, I pray God forgiue me, or the like, but alasse, that is not sufficient, thou must know the Lord accepts not thy con∣fession and humiliation for that sinne, vnlesse thou make some satisfaction to thy poore seruant, for his hurt or maime receiued by thee. Therefore doubtlesse vniust dealing with seruants, is a great and greeuous sinne, farre greater then some conceiue it. Againe, vniust dealing with seruants is a plaine eui∣dence of the want of Gods feare, Leuit. 25.43. Thou shalt not rule ouer thy brother being thine hired seruant cruelly, but  shalt feare thy God. Where we see an opposition betweene hard and cruell vsage of seruants, and the feare of God. If the people of God vnder the Law, dealt cruelly with their brethren be∣ing their seruants, they shewed plainely they had no feare of God in them, and the reason is giuen verse 42. because they were the Lords seruants, whom hee brought out of the land of Aegypt. And is it not a more plaine euidence of the want of Gods feare, cruelly and vniustly to deale with seruants vnder the Gospell brought and bought out of spirituall Aegypt, and the bondage of sinne and Satan by Christ, and redeemed with his precious bloud, aswell as our selues, without question it is. Last of all, consider what Iob saith, 31.13. hee prote∣steth
he did not contemne the iudgement of his seruant, and of his maide, when they did contend with him, and thinke themselues ill entreated by him. Marke his reason verse 14.15. Hee that made mee in the wombe, hath hee not made him, and if I should deale vniustly or cruellie with them; What then shall I doe when God standeth vp? and when he shall visit me, what shall I answer? as if hee had sayd, if I wrong my poore seruants, how shall I stand before him that is Lord and master of vs both? and how shall I come to him, and call on him with comfort, when his hand shall bee on mee, and when hee shall visit mee with anie affliction? a reason of waight and to be throughly con∣sidered. Wee see by this, if a master deale vniustlie or cruellie with his seruants, hee shall bee at his wits end, and not know what to doe, nor how with anie comfort to looke vp to the Lord, and call on him when the Lord stands vp against him, and visits him with anie trouble, especially if the Lord crosse him, by the vndutifull or vnconscionable dealing of his seruant, as it is iust with the Lord so to doe, the master hauing dealt hardly with his seruant, either pressed him with too heauie burdens, pinched him in his food, cruellie corrected him, or anie waie wronged him, it is iust with the Lord that such a master, some∣times suffers punishment at the hands of his seruant, and is crossed by the vndutifull and vnconscionable dealing of his seruant; yea, sometimes smitten with that seruants tongue, the seruant telling abroad to his shame and discre∣dit his hard vsage, and it may be adding some thing to it, as that he hath not a good meales meat in a yeere, or the like: When an vniust and cruell master, is thus crossed and smitten, he cannot appeale to the Lord, and haue recourse to him, and pray to him, that he would release him from that crosse; his owne vniust and vnconscionable dealing with his seruant, sets a barre betweene him and heauen, and he cannot praie to the Lord with comfort.
If then thou that art a Master, wouldest not exceed∣ingly prouoke the Lord to anger against thee, and com∣mitte a crying sinne, a sinne calling for vengeance, and for which the Lorde will not accept thy humilliation without some satisfaction to thy poore seruant. If thou wouldst not make it euident, that thou hast no true feare of God in thee: if thou wouldst not set a bar betweene thee and heauen, and not bee able to pray to the Lorde, with comfort or any assurance of release, when the Lord doth visite thee with any affliction; especially when thou art crossed by the vndutifull, and vnconscionable dealinge of thy seruant, and smitten by the tongue of thy seruant, and happilie wronged by him. Then in the feare of God bee admonished to yeeld to euery one of thy seruantes, that which is just and equall: require of them things proportionable to their strength, giue them foode and raimente, or competent wages, to prouide them, and that in due time; haue care to measure out to them, just censure and correction for their faultes; yeeld them moderate rest from their labours, and lawfull re∣creation, and in time of their sicknesse prouide (as thou art able) all good meanes that serues for their health and recouerie, and that they haue good vsage in time of their weakenesse; and giue them also according to thy pow∣er, some further recompence ouer and aboue their wages, at their departure, according to the good and long seruice they haue done thee; and if thou make conscience of these thinges, doubtles the Lord will blesse thee in thy seruants, and blesse their labours to thee. And if thou bee crossed by the vndutifull or vnconscionable dealing of thy ser∣uant, yet thou maist haue recourse to the Lord with com∣fort: powre out thy complaint into his bosome, and hee will heere thy prayers. One thing more may be gathered from this exhortati∣on of the Apostle, considered together with some thinge goeing before.
Wee are to marke that the Apostle hauing saide in the chapter before, that seruantes truely beleeuing in Christ, and doeing their dutie to their Masters, as they ought: in singlenesse of heart; they shall receiue of the Lord, the reward of euerlastinge inheritance: the LORD doth esteeme them as his sons and heires, of his eternall king∣dome of glorie, and will rewarde them as his sonnes and heires. Yet heere hee exhorts Masters, to deale justly with them, and to yeeld vnto them, meate, drinke, and thei just wages: and heere Masters are bound, and of right, ought to giue their seruants these things: and seruants may lawfully receiue, & injoy them, and still looke for the pro∣mised reward of eternal life, the point hence arising is this. That right and title to heauenly inheritance, doth not  hinder,Right and ti∣tle to heauen∣ly inheritance doth not hin∣der any one from hauing part in the outward good things of this life. nor bar any one for hauinge part in the outwarde good thinges of this life, that is a child of God, and joint heire with Christ of the kingdome of heauen, may not∣withstanding, haue, hold, injoy, and posses wordly things, euen those thinges it pleaseth the Lord to giue him, in his place and calling: and yet certainely looke for the promi∣sed reward of eternall life. It is a fancy and dreame of the Papists, which they thrust on their followers, that to lacke propriety in worldly goods, and willfully to refuse the possession of them, shall haue reward in heauen aboue o∣ther states of life: a true beleeuing seruant doeing his du∣tie in his place and calling, and receiuinge his wages from his master, holding and vsing it as he ought:  shall doubt∣lesse receiue of the Lord,Confutation of a Popish fancy. the reward of euerlastinge inhe∣ritance, when such proud Popish votaries, who willfullie refuse to posses any wordly goods vpon conceit of greater perfection: and indeed refuse labour, and all other good excersises and liue on the sweat of other mens browes: shal∣be shutte out of heauen, and throwne downe to hell. Come we to the second generall thing laid down in this verse (namely) the reason, the Apostle vseth to perswade all masters, to yeeld to their seruants that which is just and
equall, taken from their subiection to an higher master, amplified by their owne knowledge of it, or that they ought to know it, and by setting downe what master it is (namely) not an earthly but an heauenly master (knowing) the word is the same we had verse 24 chap. 3.Interpre∣tation. and so to be expounded (knowing) that is, certainely knowing (yee also) that is, euen yee as well as your seruants (haue a ma∣ster) that is, haue one aboue you, who as a master hath power and authority ouer you, to call you to an account for things done or left vndone, to whom you must yeeld a reckoning and account, as of all other things, so of your dealing with your seruants (in Heauen) the meaning of that amplification is not that they haue a Lord and ma∣ster in Heauen, locally circumscribed as the Epicure thinkes, Iob 22.14. but the meaning is a great, mightie, and most powerfull Lord and Master, euen the Almighty Lord of Heauen and earth, who is heere sayd to bee in heauen, because he is most glorious and most powerfull, able to punish offendours most seuerely, and as the Apo∣stle sayth, Rom. 1.18. to reueale and manifest his wrath against them from heauen, euen to poure and to raine downe his iudgements on them, as a mighty storme that fals with violence from heauen on the earth. Thus then conceiue wee the words, as if the Apostle had sayd. Certainely knowing that your selues as well as your seruants haue one aboue you, as a master, that hath power and authority ouer you, to call you to an account for your dea∣lings with your seruants, euen the Almighty Lord of Heauen and earth, who is most glo∣rious, mighty and powerfull, able to punish you (if you offend) most seuerely, and to throw downe his iudgements on you, as a mighty storme from heauen.
We are heere first to marke and consider the argument of the Apostle: he reasons thus with Masters, ye Masters yeeld to your seruants that which is iust and equall, for you your selues are vnder another, you haue one as a ma∣ster aboue you, who hath power and authoritie to call you to accompt for your dealings, and to punish you if you deale vniustly and vnconscionably with your seruants, where wee see the Apostle perswades masters to doe their duetie to their seruants by an argument from their subie∣ction to an higher Lord and Master, who sits aboue them as a Soueraigne Lord, hauing poure to call them to an ac∣count and to punish them for their neglect of dutie, or a∣nie abuse of their authority, and they are to consider it. Hence we may gather this conclusion. That a speciall meanes to keepe masters, and indeede  men in anie place of eminencie and superioritie in good order, and to make them carefull of their dutie,If masters and all superiours contnually remember that they haue a supreame heauenly Lord and ma∣ster aboue them, it is a notable means to make them conscionable and carefull in doing their duty. Iob 31.21. and to do it as they ought, is for them to haue an eye vpward and e∣uer to looke, and to fixe their eyes on a soueraigne Lord that is aboue their Masters & all superiours, men in any place aboue others are euer to carry in mind and remem∣ber that they haue a supreame heauenly Lord and master aboue them, to whose censure they are subiect, and to whom they must one daie render an account of all their dealings, & they shall finde it will be a notable meanes to worke in them a conscience of their duty, and to make them euer carefull to do it aright, we haue a worthy exam∣ple of this in Iob, he cleeres himselfe (being in place aboue others) from abusing his power & authority, to the wrong of anie poore helplesse person vnder him, and he wisheth that if he lift vp his hand aganst the fatherlesse, that is, v∣sed his power and authoritie against the fatherlesse, when he might help him in the gate that is in the place of iustice that his arme might fall from his shoulder,22. and be broken from the bone, and marke his reason what moued him to take such heede of abusing his authority and to abstaine
from doing wrong, and dealing vniustly with any? surely this, he had his eye euer vpward, his eye, euen the eye of his minde, was euer on the great and glorious Maiesty of the Lord,23. he knew and remembred that he had a Lord a∣boue him, and if he did wrong to his inferiours, hee was subiect to his punishing hand, as himselfe saith verse 23. for Gods punishment was fearefull vnto mee, and I could not be deliuered from his highnesse, we read Gen. 50.19 that Ioseph reasoned thus, with his brethren fearing (their father being now dead) that hee would haue payd them againe all the euill which they had done to him, & came vnto him, and craued pardon of him, and sayd, wee pray thee forgiue the trespasse of the seruants of thy fathers God,Vers. 17. Ioseph made them this answer, Feare not, for am not I vnder God? as if he had sayd, do not think that I will deale with you as you doe imagine and take on me (now I haue power) to vse my power to that end, to requite the wrong you haue done to me, no, no, my brethren, I know I am subiect to an higher power, I am vnder God and I haue mine eye on that great and mightie Lord that is a∣boue me, and therefore feare no such matter; a plaine e∣uidence and proofe of this point that it is an excellent meanes to keepe masters and all superiours in order, and from dealing vniustly and vnconscionably with their in∣feriours, euen to lift vp their eyes and to look vpward and to remember that they haue a supream Lord aboue them to whose censure they are subiect, and to whom they must one day giue an account. The reasons of this is plaine. First, that the looking vpward, and euer hauing an eye  to that great & mighty Lord that is aboue them, wil work in them a reuerent awe and feare of his glorious maiesty, and that feare will temper and season their courage, and cause them to carrie in them a conscience of dooing right, and keepe them from dooing wrong to anie. And,
Secondly, it will worke in them humility, an humble minde, and humble carriage, and not suffer their mindes to swell, nor to bee lift vp in them aboue their brethren,Deut 17.20. which the Lord would not haue in the King himselfe; which swelling indeed is the cause of scorne and contempt and of oppression and wrong. Heereby then wee may see, whence it comes to passe  that many Masters, and other superiours abuse their power and authority,Whnce it is that Masters and other Superiours a∣buse their po∣wer and au∣thority. and make no conscience of dea∣ling iustlie and conscionably with their seruants and in∣feriours, they feare not to wring them and wrong them, and to deale hardly with them in many respects, heere is one speciall cause of it, they looke not vpward, they haue not an eie and due regard to that great Lord that is aboue them. Would Masters and other Superiours if they had an eie to heauen, if they did behold the high and glorious Maiestie that sits aboue them, with vengeance in his hand to bee throwne downe vpon them, if they deale vniust∣lie and vnconscionably with their Seruants; would they then, as sometimes they doe, not care to doe open wrong to their Seruants, that all men see, and crie shame vp∣pon? Or would they couertly and cunningly wrong them, happily vnder colour of law and iustice, equity and conscience? As Iesabel dealt with Naboth, 1 King. 21. Certainely no, if they had any sparke of grace in them, they would not, but many Masters and Superiours looke only downward, and their eie is only on the poore seruant, and such as are vnder them, and thence comes much vniust and vnconscionable dealing towards them, and that makes them swell and lift vp themselues aboue them, and their owne corruption helped forward by the Deuill, teacheth them to thinke and say with them∣selues. What? Am not I a man of place and authoritie? am not I in this or that office?
Yea, to say as it is Psalm. 12 4. Who is Lord ouer me? Who shall checke and controle me for my dealing with my ser∣uant, or my inferiour? Who hath any thing to doe with it? with many like speeches. And therefore thou that art a master, or in any place of superiority aboue others,Masters and other Superi∣ours are to haue an eie to that great and glorious Lord that is aboue them. euer lift thou vp thine eie, and looke vppe to that great and glorious Lord that is aboue thee, and remember that he hath power ouer thee, to call thee to an account, and to censure thee, yea to throw both bodie and soule into Hell for sinne, and it will be a nota∣ble curbe to thee, and hold thee backe from vniust and vn∣conscionable dealing with any that is vnder thy power, and withall remember, that in respect of thy power and authority, thou bearest the image of God, and wilt thou blot and blemish that, and abuse that to worke iniustice and to doe wrong? certainely that sinne cannot escape the sharpe punishing hand of God. Come we to the amplification of the Apostles argu∣ment in the word (Knowing) that is, certainely knowing, being perswaded of it as a certaine truth, where we see, the Apostle speaketh to Masters among the Colossians, as to men certainely knowing, and nothing doubting, but that they had a master aboue them in heauen; the Apostle made no question, but that it was a knowne truth, where∣of Masters among the Colossians were assured, and fully perswaded: and he doth enlarge his argument, and fur∣ther presse this duty on them from their owne knowledge of this, that they had a Master aboue them, as if hee had said. Yee Masters doe that which is iust and e∣quall to your seruants, forasmuch as you are not ignorant, but you certainely know it, that you haue one aboue you as a Master, that hath power and authority ouer you, to call you to an account for your dealings with your seruants.
Hecne we gather thus much. That certaine knowledge of the truth of that which is brought in way of argument to perswade to any dutie,Certaine knowledge of the truth of an argument either of per∣swasion, or of disswasion, is of great force to preuaile with them in whom that knowledge is. or to diswade from any sinne, is of great waight and force to preuaile with them in whom that knowledge is; when a man can say to any person or persons, doe this, for you know how you are bound to doe it, or what will follow the doing of it, or auoide that, for you know the danger of it, it giues great aduantage for the seating and setling of that perswasion, or diswasion on the hearts of them to whom it is directed. Hence it is that our Apostle doth often vse this kinde of enforcement, either to presse some dutie, or to disswade from some sinne, that they to whom he writ knew this or that, as 1. Cor. 6. We haue example of it in many verses, as verse 2. Doe not yee know that the Saints shall iudge the World? Verse 9. Know yee not that the vnrighteous shall not inherite the kingdome of God? and in many other verses of that Chapter. Ephes. 5.5. He vseth the same kind of am∣plification; For this yee know that no Whooremonger, &c. And hither I might bring many other places, wherein the same enforcement and amplification is vsed, being indeede of great force to settle an argument on the hearts of them to whom it is directed, and the reason is plaine, (namely) this. The minde and iudgement beeing conuinced of the truth of an argument,  the will and affections are more ea∣sily wrought on by the same, and more easily moued to embrace or refuse, and consequently, the whole man to practise or decline, according to the drift and purpose of it. Now this serues to discouer the exceeding hardnesse,The excee∣ding hardnes and searednes of many mens hearts disco∣uered. and (as I may say) the searednesse of of the hearts of ma∣ny in the world, who will not be perswaded to that which is good, or disswaded from that which is euill, though they know that to be most true, yea, truth it selfe, that is
brought as an argument to worke on them; as let this vndeniable agument be brought to disswade the swearer, the drunkard, or any other prophane person from his sinne; that one day he must appeare before Gods iudge∣ment seat and come to iudgement for his sinne, and it moues him nothing at all, no, though it be sharpened and driuen downe with this enforcement, that hee knowes it to be true and his owne conscience tels him so, yet the edge of it is many times turned backe, and blunted on the hardnesse of his heart. Wilt thou say thou swearer, thou drunkard, or thou prophane person, whosoeuer thou art, that thou knowest not this, or thou art not perswaded of the truth of it, that thou must one day come to iudgement for thy sinne? Why there is one within thee, euen thine own conscience will tell thee the contrary. Some knowledge of a iudge∣ment to come is implanted in nature: the very heathen in the darkenesse of nature had some glimmering light of it, and therefore set vp Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, as iudges in Hell. And hence it is, that euen meere naturall and carnall men, though they sinne in a corner, no eye of man looking vpon them, yet they tremble and are afraid, and the word of God is pregnant and plentifull to this purpose, and it hath often sounded in our eares, and therefore thou canst not plead ignorance, that thou knowest it not, and yet wil not thy knowledge of the truth of this argument (thou knowing it to be true from the light of nature, and from the word of God) worke on thee, and disswade thee from thy sinne? Oh then thou must needes confesse thou hast a most hard and benummed heart, and that is the greatest plague that can befall any in this life, that is greater then the ten plagues of Aegipt, and therefore now take notice of thy fearefull condition, and with speed hasten out of it, and take this with thee, and thinke on it, if thy knowledge of this truth that there is a Lord aboue, and a iudge of all
the world, who will one day bring thee to iudgement for thy sinne, doe not now preuaile with thee to disswade thee from thy sinne, thou shalt one day finde and seele the truth of it, yea, thou shalt seele the waight of his wrath to thy eternall woe and confusion for euer. The Apostle addes (in heauen) a master in heauen (that is) a most glorious, mighty, and powerfull Master. Hence it is cleare. That Masters and all Superiours haue a most mightie and powerfull Lord and Master ouer them,Masters and all Superiours haue a most mightie and powerfull Lord and ma∣ster ouer thē. therefore they are to serue him in feare,They are to serue that Lord in feare. and to reioice vnto him with re∣uerence, Psal. 2.11. And to feare the stroake of his hand it must needes be an heauie stroake that comes from the highest heauens. The greatest man in the world, can fetch his blow but from his head; his crowne,  his power and au∣thority, which is only to kil the bodie; but the stroak of the Lords hand comes downe from heauen, yea, from aboue all heauens, and if it light on thee it killes both body and soule, it strikes thee downe to hell, and therefore take heed of it. Note we in a word thus much further that the Lord is said to be in heauen,How the Lord is said to be in hea∣uen. not because he is there circumscribed, but because he is most mighty and powerfull. Heereby is mette with the foolish opinion of some blind people,The foolish opinion of ig∣norant people met withall. who thinke that God sits in heauen like an old man, with a Crowne on his head, and a Scepter in his hand: and this must teach vs, when we come before the Lord, to pray vn∣to him, to heare his word, or the like,Note. to come with al reue∣rence and feare, this is the argument of the Preacher, Eccl. 5.1. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to vtter any thing before God: for God is in the heauens and thou art on the earth, let thy words be few. We must take heed of lightnesse and vnseemely behauiour in the presence of God.
VER. 2. Continue in praier, and watch in the same with thankesgiuing. I haue not yet laid foorth the parts of this Chapter, though I haue handled the first verse of it, because (in∣deede) the first verse of this Chapter belongs to foregoing matter, being a continuance of the Apostles exhortation to speciall duties that concerne Christians, and so rather to be reserued to the former Chapter then to this. The parts of this Chapter.But now for the generall resolution of this Chapter, into the parts of it, leauing that verse as belonging to the third Chapter. Know we that it containes in generall two things. First, a regression, and a returne made by the Apostle, from speciall duties of Christians to generall, and that by way of exhortation, from the beginning of the 2. verse to the 7. And Secondly, the conclusion of this whole Epistle from verse 7. to the end of the Chapter.The conclusi∣on of this Epi∣stle subdiui∣ded. Now the conclusion containes in it these more speciall branches. First, a declaration of the Apostles owne loue, and care of the Colossians, by sending certaine Messengers vnto them,. vers. 7.8.9. Secondly, a declaration of the loue of others towards, them, both by their salutations sent to them, and by their praiers for them in the 10.11.12.13.14. Thirdly, a setting downe of some speciall things the A∣postle willed the Colossians to doe, and should cause to be done, both to the Church of Laodicea, and to some par∣ticular persons in the 15.16.17. verses, and Lastly, the shutting vppe of the Epistle with the Apo∣stles owne salutation, and his prayer to God for them, with a short precept interlaced between these two things▪ verse 18.
Now then the first generall (as we said) is a regression,The first ge∣nerall part of this Chapter subdiuided. a turning from speciall to generall duties, the Apostle ex∣horting thereunto in 2.3.4.5.6. verses, and his exhortati∣on is twofold, and may thus be branched out. First, an exhortation to prayer and thanksgiuing in 2.3.4. verses. Secondly, to a wife cariage and behauior towards them  that are without in the 5. and 6. verses. For the first of these the Apostle doth exhort to prayer and thanksgiuing, both for themselues and for others ge∣nerally vers. 2. and then also for him and Timothy in parti∣cular, expressing what he would haue them to aske of God for them in verses 3.4. Come we then to his general exhortation in the second verse, (Continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanks∣giuing) where we haue the Apostles exhortation to prayer, not barely propounded, but amplified by two qualities which he requireth in prayer, (namely) continuance and watchfulnesse; he exhorts to prayer, and that continuall and earnest, (continue in prayer and watchfulnesse in the same) and then to ioyne to prayer thanksgiuing. Continue (that is) go on, perseuer,Interpreta∣tion. and be incessant (in prayer) the word translated prayer, in this place doth pro∣perly signifie adoration, or an humble entreaty for any thing at the feete of another, when a man doth prostrate and humble himselfe at the feet of another and intreat for some thing at his hands, and so this worde is heere to bee taken in a large sence and signification (namely) for any humble and holy request made and offered vp to God by faith in the name of Christ, for things needfull, either for our selues, or others, the word (praier) in this place, is to be taken as comprehending vnder it both request made to God, for good things for our selues, properly called peti∣tion, and request made for the auoiding, or remouing of euill from our selues, called supplication, or deprecation, and also request made for the good of others, or the tur∣ning
away of euill from others, called intercession, as they are distinguished by the Apostle, 1 Tim. 2.1. I exhort there∣fore, that first of all supplications, praiers, intercessions, and gi∣uing of thankes be made for all men. (And watch in the same) The meaning of these words is, and bee feruent in that holy excercise of Praier, let it bee performed of you with earnest intention of soule and bo∣die, for watchfulnesse (as we know) is opposed to drowsi∣nesse, and sleepinesse; and so heere, being applied to prai∣er, is opposed to a cold, carelesse, drowsie, and sluggish performance of that dutie: (with thankesgiuing) that is, with returning praise, and thankes to God, for good things receiued, whether they bee obtained by your re∣quests, or freely bestowed vpon you, without, or aboue your supplication. Thus then conceiue we the meaning of the Apostle in the words of this verse, as if he had said. Perseuere, and be incessant in making and offering vp to God by faith, in the name of Christ, humble, and holy requests for things needfull, both for your selues and others, and be feruent in that holy exercise, perfor∣ming it, with earnest intention, both of heart, minde, and body, and returne praise for good things receiued, whether they be giuen vpon your request, or freely bestowed vpon you, without, or aboue your suppli∣cations. Wee are heere to marke, that our Apostle hauing laide before the Colossians, many excellent duties, both gene∣rall and speciall, both common to all Christians, and pro∣per to some in their particular state and condition of life, he now exhorts them to praier. Our lesson hence is this.
Although teaching and exhortation bee singular and notable meanes to frame vs to godlinesse and righteous∣nesse  of life, yet ought prayer also to bee adioyned to them. It is not enough for vs to heare, and to be enformed of duties that concerne vs, both as we are Christians, and in our particular states and conditions of life, and to be stir∣red vp to the practise of them, but to that enformation and incitement, prayer must be added,It is not suffi∣cient to be in∣formed what duties con∣cerne vs both in generall & particular, & to be stirred vp to the pra∣ctise of them, but to that in∣formation & incitement prayer must be added. both publike and priuate, for why? as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 3.6. I haue planted, Apollos watered, but God gaue the increase: so then neither is hee that planteth, any thinge, neither hee that wate∣reth, but God that giueth the increase. Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God giues the increase, and at his hand it must be sought for, by earnest prayer; the Lorde that hath promised a blessing to his ordinance, hath appointed prayer to be the meanes to drawe it downe to vs, and ha∣uing commaunded vs to heare him speakinge to vs in his word, hee hath appointed that wee should seeke to him in prayer, to make his word effectuall vnto vs. And the reason  of this is, that wee finde 1. Cor. 2.10 it is onely the spirit of God, which searcheth the deepe thinges of God, and as no man knoweth the thinges of a man, saue the spirit of a man which is in him: so no man knowes the things of God, but the spirit of God, no man knowes the meaning of the Lord in his word, vnlesse the Lord giue him his spirit, to open and declare it to him: The outwarde teaching by the worde must bee secon∣ded by the inwarde teaching of the spirit of God, other∣wise it will be vnprofitable, yea hurtfull, and a sauour of death to death, yea, though the spirit ef God doe enligh∣ten the minde, and giue vnderstanding of the comforts of the word, (as hee doth sometimes, euen to wicked men and reprobates) yet if hee worke not further then that, there is no faith in the heart to beleeue those comforts with comfort.
And though the spirit giue knowledge of duties that concerne men both in generall and speciall, yet if hee doe not also bend the will and affections, and frame the whole man to an holy obedience, certainely there will follow no conscionable practise of those dutie. Now the spirit is to be sought for by praier, and to the prayer of faith the promise is mde, that by it we shall ob∣taine the holy Ghost, Luke 11.13. if you which are euill can giue good gifts vnto your chidren, how much more shall your heauenly father giue the holy Ghost to them that desire him. And therefore (doubtlesse) to teaching and exhortation out of the word, that they may be effe∣ctuall, prayer must bee added, both publique and pri∣uate. This then (for the vse  of it) giues mee iust occasion to reprooue many persons who haue no manner of care nor conscience in them of this duty,Reproofe of them who adde not prayer to their hearing of the word of God. many there be, who re so farre from adding praier to that which they haue heard taught, and to which they haue beene exhorted out of the word of God, as they neuer so much as once thinke on things deliuered; if once they get out of the Church the things spoken are to them as though they had neuer heard them. They suffer the Diuell to steale the seed out of their hearts, and to take vp their mindes with other thoughts, yea, if (happily) some doe a little thinke or speake of things they haue heard, and will freely confesse that Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but God giues the encrease. Yet where is almost the man or wo∣man, that doe so humble themselues in prayer, and pri∣uately call on God to make the things they haue heard profitable to them, and to worke in them faith and holie obedience, such a man or woman is rare for to bee found. What? doest thou dreame of anie strength in thy selfe, to beleeue or to doe the things thou hast heard out of the word of God? Art thou so vnacquainted with the corrup∣tion
of thine owne heart? that is a grosse blindnesse in∣deede, and if thou so thinke, thou shalt neuer doe anie good dutie made knowen to thee out of Gods worde: good duties are discouered to thee out of the worde of God, that thou mayest see thine owne weakenesse and wants, and bewaile them, and humbly beseech the Lord, aswell to make thee obedient to his will, as to reueale to thee the rule of life. And for want of this, because men doe not adde pri∣uate praier to that which hath beene taught, and to which they haue beene exhorted, it comes to passe that the word is vnfruitfull and vnprofitable to them, though both generall and speciall duties haue beene layd before them, and they haue beene stirred vppe to the practise of them, yet most men are still in their sinnes, and as vnreformed as euer they were, and heere is the cause of it, to teach∣ing and stirring vppe to their duties, they neuer added prayer, they neuer humbly besought the LORD, as hee had outwardly taught rhem their dueties by prea∣ching, so hee would inwardly teach them by his ho∣ly Spirit, and worke in them a conscience of their due∣ties. Well, consider (I beseech you) it is a fearefull thing when the holy ordinances of God haue no power with vs, when they are not effectuall to our good, and that comes to passe for want of earnest prayer to God, as∣well in priuate as in publique for a blessing vppon them. Yea, hence it is, that oft times the LORD doeth powre downe a curse vppon men, and they are made woorse by the holy thinges which they haue hearde and therefore learne we euer heereafter, to teaching and exhortation to adde prayer. Yea, let such as make conscience to meditate and con∣ferre on the word heard, ioyne to their meditation and conference earnest and hearty praier, it was Dauids pra∣ctise
to meditate in the Law of God continually, Psal. 119.97. verse, and that he sanctified his meditation by praier, it is cleare Psal. 19 14. let the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength and my redeemer, and therefore thinke not because thou art a man fearing God, and thou makest conscience to medi∣tate on the word heard, and thou doest rightly conceiue of thinges deliuered, therefore thou needest not adde praier to thy meditation; no, no, the more godly thou art, the more need hast thou to praie, because Satan wil be bu∣siest against thee, & thou art the readiest to bee puffed vp with a conceit of thy knowledge & remembrance of holy things therfore do not thou forget to ioine to thy hearing to thy meditation & conference, earnest & humble praier. Nowe touching the Apostles exhortation to prayer, much might be sayd of praier in generall, but I hold that not so pertinent to the purpose of the Apostle, I will ra∣ther speake of the qualities heere required to bee in prayer. First therefore the Apostle requires continuance and perseuerance in praier,We are to continue and perseuere in prayer. that wee continue and perseuere in calling on the name of the Lord in praier, and pray continually, and this the Scripture much exhorteth vnto, 1. Thessal. 5.17. Pray continually, Ephesians 6.18. Pray alwaies with all manner of praier and supplication in the Spirit, Luke 18.1. Our Sauiour spake a Parable vn∣to them, to this end, that they ought alwaies to pray, and not to waxe faint, and this I might further prooue by many examples, and make it cleare that wee are not to thinke the exercise of prayer, needlesse or vnseasonable at any time. The reason  is plaine, praier is to bee vsed as oft as oc∣casion is offered, nowe all times minister occasion of praier, for what time is it, wherein wee ought not to praie that the LORDS name may bee sanctified, his Kingdome erected, his will performed, our necessities
supplied, our sinnes remitted, we supported in temptati∣on and deliuered from euill? And if wee haue all things that heart can wish, belon∣ging both to bodie and soule, yet wee haue neede to craue Gods blessing on them, that they may doe vs good. All times therefore ministring occasion of prayer, wee are to pray continually. If this bee so, may some say,  then no time is to bee giuen to the preseruation of life, and to follow the workes of our callings, this was the errour of some verie an∣tient. To answer  it, so as wee may avoyd this errour, and yet preserue the true meaning of the Scripture, know we that the exercise of prayer is twofold, ordinarie and extraordi∣narie. Ordinarie, to bee vsed daily: Extraordinarie, at some times, as occasions requires, as for the auoyding or remo∣uing of some great affliction, or heauie iudgement, or for the obtaining of some needefull grace or temporall bles∣sing, and for the performance of this, a man may for a time omit the workes of his calling, and giue himselfe whollie to prayer, but ordinarie praier, that may stand with the performance of all dueties belonging to a mans calling, a man may both serue God by ordinarie prayer, & that continuallie, & do whatsoeuer his calling (though it bee most laborious) doth require, and that this may be conceiued. Know we further. That ordtnarie prayer is either set and solemne, in am∣ple manner to be performed, and that vpon set and certen occasions, as at the beginning of workes, at the receiuing of the creatures of God, at our going to rest at night, or it is sudden and short, called Eiaculation of heart (that is) a secret and suddaine lifting vp of the heart vpon any occasion; and this kinde of ordinarie praier may be vsed
in the midst of necessarie businesse, it doth neither hinder it, nor is hindred by it. Thus wee see how wee may pray continually, ei∣ther by set, or by suddaine prayer, and yet not omit the dueties of our callings, nor the preseruation of life. Now then to perswade to this duty, to which wee are hardlie drawen:Reproofe of such as pray by fits and starts, and of such as either breake he vse of that exer∣cise, or sel∣dome vse it. and hence it is, that some pray onely by fits and starts, only in time of some affliction, when the hand of God is on them, or when their consciences are a little touched with the point of the spirituall sword, the word of God, and some there bee, who heeretofore haue vsed praier in their houses, and now haue either altogether left off that exercise, or seldome vse it, and so indeed shew themselues to be hypocrites, Iob doth so brand them, Iob. 27.10. will the hypocrite call vpon God at all times or continually; as if hee had sayd, certainely no, hee will not. Two motiues to stirre vs vp to ontinu∣ce nd per∣ uernce in praier.Now then to perswade vs to the practise of this duetie: consider the necessitie of it, and the sweete and comforta∣ble fruits of it. For the necessitie of it, to passe by our owne wants of bodie, and soule, which (if we feele) will bring vs on our knees, there is a necessitie lying vpon vs in regard of Gods commandement, praier being a speciall branch of his wor∣ship required in his word, and his will is, that this com∣mandement should be as well kept as any other, and con∣demnation will befall vs, as well for the neglect of this, as of anie other? And for the fruits of praier,The excellent fruits of praier they are ma∣nie and great. Praier as a meanes (not as a meritorious cause not by merit and worthinesse in it selfe but by faith in the promise) as a meanes (I say) it obtaines remission of sinnes, it turnes awaie all euils as punishments; and sup∣plies all wants, it doth sanctifie and giue an holie vse of all the good things we enioy, and without which wee are v∣surpers, and doe wickedly abuse Gods blessings. For all
things are sanctisied to our vse by the word and praier, 1. Tim. 4 4. Yea further, praier giues strength to faith, hope, and o∣ther graces of Gods spirit. And is it impossible (saith one) that either that Christian who is diligent in praier, should bee weake in faith and other graces, or that grace should abound where there is a neglect of praier, Matth. 26.41. watch and pray (saith Christ) that ye enter not into temp∣tation, as if he had said, be vigilant and carefull in the per∣formance of this dutie, that you may bee strong in faith, able to quench the fierie darts of the Diuell, and to with∣stand the force of temptation to sinne. And hence it is that one saith, praie, and sinne if thou canst, noting how speciall a preseruatiue praier is against temptation, if in time of temptation, we flie to God in the praier of faith, for strength and assistance, we shall ei∣ther haue the temptation remooued, or receiue the an∣swer made to Paul, 2. Cor. 12.9. my grace is sufficient for thee. Oh then seeing such precious fruits come from praier, let vs bee stirred vp to a continuall vse of it, and to hold on a constant and continued course in the practise of it, not onelie publiquelie in the congregation, but priuatelie in our houses, with our families, that so wee may become familiar, and as it were better acquainted with the Lord, for in praier we haue some familiar fellowship with God. Let vs therefore haue recourse to the LORD by praier, that by it, as a meanes, wee may obtaine par∣don of sinne, freedome from all euilles, supplie of all wants, and further strength and encrease of all graces. Wee are to take notice of one thing further comprised vnder this first qualitie of continuance and perseuerance in praier, for indeede the word heere rendered (continue) signifieth not onelie continuance in regard of time, but instancie and importunitie, and it is so translated by some, and that truelie, be instant in prayer.
So that hence we are taught. That wee must not onely pray continually in regard of time,We must after an holy man∣ner be instant and importu∣nate with God in prayer. but wee must bee instant and importunate with the Lord in praier, with an holie instancie and importunitie, wee must not onely hold on a constant and continued course in prayer, but we must also sollicite the Lord often, for the same things, if our requests bee not granted, wee must pray for the same needfull things againe and againe, till he Lord answer vs graciously, heare our prayers, haue mercy, and helpe vs with such things as wee craue at his hands, or something proportionable, and this our Sauiour hath taught vs by the example of a man that comes to borrow bread of his friend at mid-night, Luke 11.8. I say vnto you, though hee would not arise and giue him because hee is his friend, yet doubtlesse, because of his importunitie, hee would rise and giue him as ma∣nie as hee needed. So saith Christ, aske and it shall bee giuen you, not onely aske but seeke, neither there rest, but knocke, and and this also is taught by the Parable of the widdow and wicked iudge, who feared not God, nor reuerenced man Luke 18.1.5. and the reasons why wee must bee instant in prayer, and after an holy manner importunate, and euen bold suiters of God, asking and crauing the same needefull things (as yet not granted) againe and againe are two. First, to shew our earnest and hearty desire of the things wee pray for, comming from a true inward feeling of the want of them, that wee heartily desire them as things most profitable, and good for vs, and therefore will not suffer the Lord as it were, to rest till he grant them vn∣to vs. Secondlie, to shewe our patient dependance on Gods good pleasure, that wee beleeue the promises of God, not onely touching the substance of them, but also in regarde of the circumstance of time, that wee waite
and depend on the LORD, not onely in the mat∣ter of his promise, but also in respect of his owne good time appointed for the accomplishment of it, and that wee are not such, as if wee bee not heard at the first, will fling away in a chafe, as men vse, who hauing re∣ceiued repulse and deniall, say they will neuer open their mouthes more in the matter, they will not bee so much beholding to them to whom they sue, that wee may shew our selues farre from this impatient behaui∣our, and that wee are not such as prescribe when the LORD shall heare and grant our requests, but that wee in patience depend vppon him, wee must (our lawefull requests beeing not yet granted) still con∣tinue to sollicite and importune the LORD in our praier. Many there bee who are iustly taxed as failing in this duty. Some there bee that will prescribe to the Lord when hee shall heare them, and are impatient of any delay;Reproofe of them who ei∣heir prescribe to the Lord, when be shall heare their praiers, or are impatient if their requests be not speedi∣lie graned. yea, bee there not some, who, if the Lord doe not heare them, nor and answer them according to their de∣sire, after once or twice calling vpon him, and asking of some needefull thing at his handes, euen secretly shrinke from the LORD, and say in their hearts, as the King of Israels messenger said, 2 King. 6.33. Should I attend on the Lord any longer? Their practise shewes it plainely: for let the hand of God be vpon them, and let them be vnder any affliction, in their bodies, children, or goods, and what doe they? Happily at the first they seeke and sue to the LORD by praier, themselues, and desire others to pray for them, but if comfort and deliuerance come not when they would haue it; Doe they still continue seeking and suing to the LORD? Are they impotunate suiters, in patience waiting for the Lords answere? Nothing lesse. They fall from seeking to the Lord, euen to seeke to the
Deuill and his instruments, to Witches, Wizards, and such like: Surely such persons shew they haue no true faith in the promise of God, they trust not God on his word for comfort in this life. And it is certaine (say what they will) they trust him not for comfort in the life to come, and for the saluation of their soules; yea, euen the deare chil∣dren of God doe sometimes faile in this dutie, and shew their infirmitie in this kind,Note. Gods children are somtimes impatient, if the Lord de∣ferre to grant their requests. when they liuing vnder some great affliction, powre out their suits to the Lord for ease, comfort, and deliuerance, and the Lord seemes to haue a deafe eare, and after some good space of time, their re∣quests are not granted, what shall yee heare sometimes from them? Surely this, or the like speech, sauouring too much of their owne weakenesse, alas, I haue many times called on God, and made my humble suit vnto him for comfort, but as yet, I finde none, or the Lord seemes to hide his face from me: and as the Prophet saith, Lament. 3.8. When I crie and shout, hee shuts out my praier? What would you haue mee to doe? Shall I still continue pray∣ing? I feare mee, the Lord is angrie with mee. Thus doe the deare children of God, sometimes discouer their weak∣nesse. 2. Things are to be conside∣red to make vs instant and importunate with God in praier.And wee must learne to strengthen our selues against it, and if thy lawfull request bee not granted after many times calling vpon God, yet doe thou still persist in prai∣er, and comfort thy selfe with the consideration of these things. First know, that the Lords delay to grant thy request,  is not a token of his anger, if so bee hee giue thee perseue∣rance in praier, if the Lord giue thee grace still to persist in praier, and still to sue to him, he deferring to grant thy request, that perseuerance is a more excellent gift and greater mercy, then the thing thou suest for, it is exceeding pleasing to the Lord. Againe, consider it is the Lords manner, many times to deferre to grant the request of his children, and that
for the speciall good of his children.4. Reasons why the Lord doth deferre to grant the requests of his children. As first, that by deferring hee may trie their hope, and exercise their faith, that he may see whether they thorow∣lie beleeue his promise, and will depend on his good∣nesse, euen then when hee seemes to hide his face from them: thus dealt Christ with the Canaanitish woman,  Matth, 15. from 22. verse to thy 28. First, she cried, Haue mercy on me oh Lord, the sonne of Dauid, my daughter is miserably vexed with a Deuill, hee answered not a word, made as though hee heard not. Secondly, his Disciples besought him for her, then hee  answered (cutting them short) hee was not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. Yet shee came againe, worshipped him, and said, Lord helpe me; hee repelled her againe with this; It is not good to take the childrens bread and to cast it to whelpes: hee cald her dog, a bitter repulse, yet shee still persisted in praier; and then he an∣swers, O woman, great is thy faith, bee it vnto thee as thou desirest. Secondly, the Lord sometimes deferreth to grant gifts sought by praier, that when they are giuen, they may be more welcome to vs. Thirdly, that his benefits should be esteemed of, more  reuerently, and not regarded as things of course. And last of all, that our feruency in praier might in∣crease. Thus the Lord dealt with Moses, Exod. 32. The Lord  purposed to spare his people, and not to destroy them, yet when Moses praied for them he seemed not to regard his praier. Nay, he said to him, vers. 10. Let mee a∣lone that my wrath may waxe hotte against them, for I will consume them; this was to enflame the affection of Moses, to make him more instant for the safety of the peo∣ple, as (indeede) hee was, verse 11. O Lord (saith hee) why doth thy wrath waxe hot against thy people which
thou hast brought out of the land of Aegypt. Thus we see that repulse must not discourage vs from perseuerance and importunity in praier, no, no, if thy lawfull request be not granted after many times praying, know it is for one of these 4. causes before spoken of: and withall remember, if the Lord giue thee grace to perse∣uere in praier, hee deferring to grant thy request, that is a more excellent gift then the thing thou suest for, and exceeding pleasing to God; and therefore let not thine owne corruption preuaile with thee, and cause thee to cease calling on God, because he seemes not to heare thee for a time, thinke not that the Lord is therefore angry with thee, that is but thine owne weakenesse, still persist in praier, and the Lord in his appointed time will heare thee, and giue thee that thou callest for, or some thing proportionable, euen that which shall be most for his glo∣rie, and thine owne comfort. Come we to the second qualitie heere required in praier (watch in the same.) The second thing our Apostle requires in praier, is watchfulnesse, (that is) feruency, that the holy exercise of praier bee performed with earnest intention of heart, minde and body,We must bee feruent in praier, and pray with earnest inten∣tion of hearts, minde, and body. it is not inough that we pray, and that we continue and perseuere in praier, vnlesse wee bee also watchfull and feruent in praier, and therefore our Apostle heere ioines these two together; Continue in praier, and watch in the same: So likewise Ephes. 6.18. requiring that wee should vse our Spirituall armor with all praier and supplication vpon all occasions, in, or by the Spirit, he ad∣deth, and watching thereunto withall perseuerance and supplication. And 1. Pet. 4.7. saith the Apostle, Bee yee therefore sober, and watching in praier; and that praier must be feruent. The reason and ground of it, is the Commandement of God, who hath inioined vs, to feare, loue, and serue him, with all our heart, soule, and strength, hee requires
vehemency and feruency in all duties both towards him∣selfe and towards men, therefore praier being an excellent seruice of God, it ought to be feruent, and to be powred out with earnest intention, both of soule and body. Hence it is called, a powring out of the soule, 1 Sam. 1.15. and of the heart, Psalm, 42.4. And indeed, the heart and in∣ward soule is the chiefe seate of feruency in praier, howso∣euer feruency in praier bee for the most part, expressed by outward signes and gestures of the body, as by shedding of teares, by lowdnesse of voice, by bowing or prostrating of the body, by lifting vp the hands, eies, and such like, yet sometimes, no doubt, there may bee a feruent praier made to God,Note. where these signes and gestures are wan∣ting, as in case of extreame weakenesse of body, when the body through rage, or extremity of sickenesse is ex∣ceedingly weakened, the senses decaied, speach taken a∣way; so that the heart and minde are the chiefe seat of fer∣uency in praier, they especially are to be carried to a quick and ready performance of the duty of praier, and to bee watchfull and attentiue in it, yet so, as (out of the case before specified) that feruency be expressed, by outward signes and gestures of the bodie, the exercise of praier must be performed with earnest intention both of soule & body. Heere then I might iustly taxe many Popish praiers, as lip-labour and displeasing to God,Many popish praiers lip-la∣bour and dis∣pleasing to God. as their praier in an vn∣knowne tongue, their numbring of praiers on their beads vttered without any sincere affection of the heart, and their mumbling vp their praiers in their canonicall houres, &c. But I leaue them, and come to our selues: Is it so,  that praier must be feruent, and that the holy exercise of inuocation must be performed with earnest intention of soule and body. What then shall wee say of such, as haue no sooner kneeled downe and lifted vp hands and eies towards hea∣uen (and some doe scarsely so much) but foorthwith,Reproofe of such as are drowsie and sluggish in praier, or pray onely of cu∣stome & for fashion sake. as if they were a sleepe, or in a heauie slumber, they hau
forgotten before whom they haue presented themselues, and what is the thing they haue in hand. Others hauing begunne well, by and by forget themselues, and suffer their drowsie mindes to bee carried to some other thing, and as if they were in a slumber speake many times they know not what, or at least they consider not what. And doe not many come before the Lord, both in publike and priuate, and call on him onely of custome, and for fashion sake, and so vtter out a cold and sluggish praier? These things are too common amongst men. Well, I beseech you to consider things aright, would any man thus behaue himselfe in making his petition to a Prince, a mortall man, and that for trash and transitorie things? Surely, if he had any vnderstanding in him, hee would not, and shall we then be so heauy, and drowsie, so cold and carelesse in supplicating, and making petition to the King of Kings, for things of greatest waight and moment? Doe we thinke to obtaine any mercy or good things at the hands of God by a sluggish and drowsie prai∣er, vttered with yawning, halfe sleeping and halfe waking? No certainely, we shall not, as the praier of faith (if it bee feruent) is an excellent seruice to God, and exceeding plea∣sing to him, and o great force to bring downe many bles∣ings from the Lord, Iam. 5.16. So on the other side, cold, sluggish, and drowsie praier, and a praier only of custome and fashion, cannot choose but bee highly displeasing to the Lord, and a meanes to pull downe his curse; for the more excellent the seruice is, and the more acceptable to God: the more shamefull a thing it is, and the more dis∣pleasing to God, to performe it slothfully and drowsily. and therefore take heed thou doe not so performe it. La∣bour thou to be feruent in praier and to put vp thy suppli∣cations and suites to the Lord with earnest intention of soule and body. And to that end vse helpes, as thou wouldest vse means to keepe the body waking, if thou wert to attend some
waighty businesse in the night:3. Things helpefull to make vs watchfull and feruent in praier. so in the holy businesse of praier, vse meanes to keepe thy minde and thy heart waking, that they may be watchfull and earnestly intend that businesse And to that purpose, First, call to minde and remember before whom thou  dost present thy selfe in praier, euen before that great and glorious maiestie, the Lord, before whom the Angels co∣uer their faces, Isai. 6.2. Secondly, bring with thee a feeling of thy wants, euen  those things thou praiest for. And thirdly, feare iust repulse, that the Lord may iust∣lie  shut out thy praiers in respect of thy cold and carelesse calling vpon him. And if thou carefully vse these, and the like helpes, doubtlesse thou shalt find them excellent meanes to rowse thee vp in praier, and to quicken thee to a feruent calling vpon the Lord, and to make thy heart and minde earnest∣ly intent on that holy businesse, and then thy praier will bee a meanes of many blessings, and much comfort vn∣to thee. The Apostle addes (with thanksgiuing) I spake of the point of thankesgiuing, Cap. 3.17. and therefore will not now stand vpon it, onely note we, that the Apostle would haue praier and thankesgiuing ioined together. Hee saith not Continue in praier, and watch in the same, and giue thanks, as if they were things to be done at seuerall times, But con∣tinue in praier, and watch in the same with thankesgiuing. Hence we may gather thus much. That euen then when we haue cause to pray, wee haue also cause to blesse the Lord,When wee haue cause to pray, we haue cause also to blesse the Lord. and to praise him, when wee are vnder some crosse or affliction, and haue cause to call on the lord for ease, and comfort, and deliuerance, e∣uen then also, haue we cause to open our mouthes to mag∣nify and praise the name of the Lord. And hence it is that our Apostle, 1 Thess. 5.18. exhorts vs to giue thankes in
all things. It is a common corruption amongst men, that the fee∣ling of some present euil and affliction it steales from them the remembrance of other mercies and blessings,Reproofe of them who are so apprehen∣siue of their present affliction as they forget Gods mercies vouchsafed vnto them. and it seales vp their mouthes that thy cannot blesse the Lord for them as they ought; let a man haue cause to blesse God for many good things, yet if hee bee crossed in any one thing, that crosse commonly takes away the remem∣brance of these good things, and he forgets to blesse the Lord for them. This is a great corruption, wee must learne to auoide it, and know, that euen then, when wee (lying vnder the hand of God) haue cause to pray, for ease, comfort, and deliuerance. We haue also cause to giue thanks to the Lord, for ma∣ny good things, for (happily) in thy affliction the Lord giues thee patience, and inward comfort; and this is cer∣taine, that in any affliction that befalles thee, the Lord deales not with thee according to thy deserts, for hee might plunge thee into the pit of Hell for thy sinnes, and if hee mittigate of that iustice, and more easily correct thee; thanke him and blesse his name for that mercy, and bee not onely feruent in crauing ease and comfort at his hands, in time of thy affliction, but at the same time remember (as thou hast iust cause) to bee also as for∣ward in giuing thankes to the LOKD for mercies re∣eeiued.
VER. 3. Praying also for vs, that God may open vn∣to vs the doore of vtterance to speake the mysterie of Christ: Wherefore I am also in bonds. In this verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colossi∣ans to pray for him and Timothie in particular, and reque∣steth them together with themselues to remember him and Timothy in their praiers, (praying also for vs) and then he expresseth what hee would haue them to aske of God for them, namely, the gift of speech and vtterance, vnder a borrowed and metaphoricall speech, in these wordes, (that God may open vnto vs the dore of vtterance) and withall he sets downe for what purpose they would haue that gift of vtterance bestowed on them, euen for the publishing and declaration of the Gospell, which (by way of com∣mendation) the Apostle cals the mysterie of Christ (to speak the mysterie of Christ) and he further shewes the excellencie of the Gospell by his sufferings for it, that for the Gospels sake, hee doubted not to expose himselfe to trouble, and was in bonds for it, (Wherefore I am also in bondes) and then hee further requires their prayers for himselfe more specially that such a gift of vtterance might bee giuen vnto him as was fit for the publishing of the Gospell, both in regarde of the excellencie thereof, and of the spe∣ciall trust of Apostleshippe committed to him verse the fourth, that I may vtter it as it becommeth me to speake, these are the generall thinges contained in these two verses. Come we to speake of them in order. And first the Apostles request made to the Colossians comes to bee considered, hee requesting their prayers for himselfe and Timothie (praying also for vs) there
is no hardnesse in the words, for the sence of them, the meaning of them is this. Remember mee and Timothie, together with your selues in your prayers, commending your selues to the LORD in your holy petitions & supplications, and vs also together with your selues. Now then wee are first to marke and consider that our Apostle requesting the prayers of the Colossians for him∣sefe and Timothy, did thereby signifie that hee and Ti∣mothy stood in nede of their prayers, and what was hee and Timothie? surely men endued with a great measure of knowledge and grace, and men of excellent gifts, Paul (no doubt) a chosen vessell of God,Act. 9.15. was a man of rare gifts, and adorned with excellent knowledge, wisedome, courage, humilitie, and manie other worthie graces of Gods spirit, and of Timothy, hee witnesseth 2. Timoth. 3.14.15. that hee had knowen the Scriptures of a childe, and was perswaded of the things hee had learned of him, yet these men request the prayers of the Colossians, and thereby implie that their prayers were indeede neede. full for them, and that they stood in neede of their prayers. Hence then we are taught thus much. The best and the most holy haue neede of the prayers of others.That euen the best haue neede of the prayers of others, men that haue the greatest measure of sanctification, knowledge, and gifts, and are in great fauour with the LORD; notwithstanding haue neede of the prayers of others for them: And hence it is that our Apostle not on∣ly heere, but in many other places doth request the prai∣ers of others for himselfe, Rom. 15.30. he entreateth the Romans earnestly, euen for the Lord Iesus Christ his
sake, and for the loue of the spirit, that they would striue with him, by prayers to God for him, Ephes. 6.19. he de∣sires them of that Church that they would make suppli∣cation for all Saints, not onely for the weaker sort, but also for the strongest, and for him in particular, that vtte∣rance might bee giuen vnto him, that he might open his mouth boldly, to publish the secret of the Gospell, 2. Thessal. 3.1. Furthermore brethren (saith the Apostle) pray for vs, that the word of the Lord may haue free pas∣sage, and bee glorified as it is with you. Thus doeth our Apostle often recommend himselfe to the prayers of o∣thers, and thereby plainely shew, that he conceiued, and would haue others to vnderstand, that he stood in need of other mens praiers. The reason  why men of greatest gifts and grace stand in need of other mens prayers are these. First, because howsoeuer they haue receiued much, yet  they still want, not onely some graces that are found in o∣thers, but in the measure and degree of those which them∣selues haue receiued, euen those graces and good gifts they haue receiued may bee further encreased, and there∣fore they stand in neede of the prayers of others to that purpose. Secondly, they are in danger through their owne corruption to swell, and to bee lifted vppe aboue their  brethren, in respect of their good giftes receiued, and therefore also haue neede of the prayers of o∣thers. Thirdly, the Diuell is most busie against them that are more emminent then others in grace and sanctifi∣cation,  hee labours by might and maine, to ouerthrow them, knowing well, that the fall of such commonly carries many others with it, and that God is more disho∣noured by their fall, then by the fall of many others, and therefore euen the best, and such as are endued with the
greatest measure of grace, haue neede to be helped by the prayers of others. Let no man then thinke himselfe so excellent and so farre aduanced aboue others in knowledge, or any grace whatsoeuer,No man is to k himselfe  xcellent in nowledge, or ny other ce as that he hath no mind of other mens praiers. as that hee hath no neede of other mens prai∣ers, if anie so thinke, hee deceiues himselfe in his owne proude conceit, and his owne heart deceiues him: if a man haue the spirit of grace, and prayer, and bee able to pray for others, and can boldely goe to the throne of grace, and his calling bee to pray for others, (hee beeing a Minister) yet hee must know that himselfe also hath neede of other mens prayers, it is not a matter of com∣plement and forme onely for a Minister, and one that is endued with an excellent gift of prayer, sometimes to recommend himselfe to the prayers of the people, no, no, hee ought to doe it, hee must consider that the force of prayer is not from the dignitie of the persons that make it,Note. but from faith in the promise, and though they that praie for him, bee farre inferiour to him in knowledge, and other excellent giftes, yet beeing manie, and ioy∣ning together in the prayer of faith, as one man, their prayers are of great force with the LORD, hee hath made a gracious promise to them, Matthew the eigh∣teenth, nineteenth and twentieth; If two of you (sayth our Sauiour) shall agree in earth vpon anie thing, whatso∣euer they shall desire, it shall be giuen them of my father which is in heauen. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. Acts 12. Wee finde that earnest prayer, beeing made by the Church to GOD, for Peter, when hee was im∣prisoned by Herod, the LORD sent his Angell and de∣liuered him. And therefore let none of vs thinke it is a matter onely of forme, or a needelesse thing for a Minister, or one that hath excellent giftes, and happilie a notable gift
of prayer himselfe, to craue the prayers of others; hee hath neede so to doe, euen in the time of his greatest strength, and in time of sickenesse, or some greate danger hee ought to require the assistance of others in prayer, and to put himselfe on the publique pray∣ers of the Church; and if the best, and such as are endued with excellent giftes, haue neede of other mens prayers, certainelie, then they much more that are of meaner gifts, and haue lesse measure of grace. Nowe before wee come to the next poynt, it is not amisse to discouer an errour of the Papists; from this and the like places of Scripture, our aduersaries the Papists would gather warrant for their inuocation of Saints de∣parted. And thus they reason. Saint Paul here and in other places desireth the prayers of others liuing on the face of the earth, & entreats them to pray for him: therefore (say they) much more may we desire the praiers of Saints departed,A Popish ar∣gument for inuocation of Saints depar∣ted. and now in glotie, and praie them to praie for vs. A weake and sillie ground, it followeth not,  that be∣cause wee may request the liuing to pray for vs, therefore wee may desire the dead and Saints departed so to doe, when wee answer them, that wee haue commandement, for one liuing man to praie for another, wee finde ex∣presse warrant in the word of God, that one liuing man may request the prayers of another, but no commande∣ment nor warrant for vs to desire the prayers of men de∣parted. What is there replie? Forsooth (say they) wee neede no commandement to praie, or desire others to praie for vs,Reply of the Papists. but it is sufficient to know their credit with God, and willingnesse to entreat for vs, when they are therunto requested,  see I beseech you how shameles these men are, in vnderpropping their bold and
vngrounded affections when they can finde noe warrant for them in the booke of God: then (forsooth) they sticke not to say wee need none, and they fly to other shiftes and speculations of their owne, would a man think that a man of learning (as they will be accounted) would euer breath and publish such rotten stuffe? why? themselues make in∣uocation of Saynts, a part of religious worship, and call it , yea they call on Saints departed, as mediators betweene God and themselues: and needs there no com∣maundement nor expresse warrant out of the worde for things so waighty? surely none, but men that care not what they vtter, would auouch it; but it is an vsuall thinge with our aduersaries thus to deale. In the next place, wee are to marke, that our Apostle hauing made knowne to the Colossians, that hee allwaies prayed for them. Chap. 1.3. Heere hee desires them to pray for him, and for Timothie: hence wee may ga∣ther thus much That it is a mutuall and reciprocall dutie, that ought to bee yeelded, from the Minister to the people, and from the people to the Minister, to pray one for another, Mnster and the peo∣ple ought mutually to pray one for another. as the Minister is bound to pray for the people, so a∣gaine are the people bound to pray for the Minister: and this is not onelie cleare by the euidence of this text, but also from other places beefore cyted, where∣in the Apostle requires to bee helped by the prayers of o∣ther Churches. And indeede there is greate reason  why the peo∣ple ought to pray for their Ministers, especially such as are faithfull. Because such Ministers are the leaders of GODS people that are in Armes againste the Prince of darkenesse, and his instrumentes the worlde without, and the fleshe within; and in that regarde, meete with many sharpe assaultes, and the people are so deeply interessed in them as that their fall is of∣ten tymes the ruine of them-selues, and the cast∣ing
downe of the Ministers is the ouerthrowe of the people, the Ministers are their sheepheardes, and if they bee smitten, the people are commonly like silly sheepe scattered abroade, they are as the watch-men of a castle or cittie, and if they bee either blinded or corrupted the citie or castle may easilie bee surprized by the enemie, by these and manie other names of similitude giuen to mini∣sters in Scripture, euerie man may see what cause the peo∣ple haue to seeke to sustaine and strengthen them by their praiers, and that they ought to striue in praier to God for them continuallie. Wee see then what we ought to doe touching this par∣ticular. Let vs duely consider it,  and learne to put this dutie in practise, men sometimes complaine of the defects and wants that are found in those that serue in that waightie calling of the Ministry,We must not rest in seeing the wants of our ministers, but wee must pray that the Lord would remoue them, and make sup∣plie of that which is wan∣ting vnto them. but fewe there bee, that seeke supplie to their wants, and strength to their weakenesse, by their often and feruent praier to God in their be∣halfe. No doubt thou maiest (if thou wilt bee curious) spie manie wants and imperfections, in the best and most faithfull Ministers, and if thou so doe, rest not in seeing and complaining of them, but vse that same meanes which the LORD hath put in thy power for the redresse of them, and praie to the LORD that hee woulde re∣mooue them, and giue supplie of that which is wanting, that is their duetie, and if thou be one that doest praie for the Minister, remember to praie for him chiefelie for his workes sake, euen in respect of the word of comfort hee brings to thee,In what re∣spect the peo∣ple are to pray for their Mi∣nister. (happilie) manie praie for the Minister in regard hee is a quiet man, and not contentious, and his outward carriage giues them contentment, (which indeed are things commendable) and men are to blesse God for these things, and pray for a Minister endued with them, but looke that thou doe as the Apostle hath taught thee
1. Thess. 5.13. Haue the Minister in singular loue for his workes sake, and testifie thy loue in praying for him, chiefelie for his workes sake, and for the worde sake; and pray thou that the LORD would more and more, fit and enable him to the worke of his ministrie, and that the LORD would open his mouth to speake to thy profit and comfort, and know that it is one great cause that men finde no sweetenesse in the comforts deliuered by the Minister, because they praie not for the Minister, that the LORD would open his mouth to speake to their com∣fort, and therefore doe thou (when thou commest to heare a faithfull Minister) praie to the Lord that he would direct his heart, and open his mouth, that hee may speake to thy good, and thy comfort, and to take this as a sure rule. Note.The best waie to finde comfort in our friendes is to praie for them, so certainelie the best waie to finde com∣fort by the Minister, is to praie for him, and therefore bee carefull to practise this duetie, and praie to the Lord that hee would moe and more fit and enable his Minister to the worke of his calling and that hee would giue him strength, courage and power, to stand against men and diuels, that seeke by force and subtiltie, to daunt and dis∣courage him, or to driue him awaie, or to hold him backe from the faithfull discharge of his ministrie, and whenso∣euer thou commest to heare him lift vp thy heart to the Lord for him, that the Lord would so guide his heart and tongue by his Spirit, that he may speake to thy profit and comfort, and then doubtlesse thou shall finde much good by his teaching. Marke wee further, that in this request of the Apo∣stle, hee saith not barelie praying for vs, but praying also for vs, praying for vs together with your owne selues. Heere then wee doe plainelie see, that in praying for our selues, wee must remember others, as mem∣bers
of one and the same body with vs: this pointe I haue heeretofore handled, and therefore I now onely name it. And know we thus much briefely. In that the Apostle saith, praying for vs, together with your selues; wee may gather that he that will pray for another, must pray for himselfe,He that will pray for ano∣ther must bee able to pray for himselfe. and hee must bee able to pray for himselfe, and if thou canst not pray for thy selfe, how canst thou pray for another. Wicked, prophane, and loose persons,  vse it as a com∣mon argument, to perswade others to doe that which they request at their hands, that they will pray for them,Reproofe of such as pro∣mise to pray for others, be∣ing not able to pray for themselues. doe this or that for me (say they) and I will pray for you, being indeed not able to pray for themselues, with comfort for as Salomon saith, Pro. 28.9. He that turneth a∣way his eare from hearing the Lawe, euen his praier shall bee abominable. Hee that is hardned in his sinnes, and willingly, and wittingly, turnes away his eare, from knowing or obeying the will of God, reuealed in his word, he cannot pray for himselfe with comfort, his praier doth incense the Lord to further wrath against himselfe, and how then can hee pray for another with comfort? doubtlesse hee cannot, and therefore labour thou to bee able to pray; and to put vp the praier of faith for thy selfe, otherwise neuer thinke that thou art able to pray for an∣other. Come wee to speake of the second generall thing laid downe in this verse (namely) the thing the Apostle did wish the Colossians to aske and craue of the LORD in their praiers for him and Timothy, expressed in these words, That GOD may open vnto vs the dore of vtterance, hee entreateth the Colossians to pray for him and Ti∣mothy, and he tels them what hee would haue them to aske of GOD for them (namely) this, That GOD might open vnto them the doore of vtte∣rance.
Interpre∣tation.That forme and phrase of speech (the dore of vtterance) in this place is a Metaphoricall and borrowed speach vsed by way of similitude, wherein the Apostle compareth the mouth, the instrument of speech, and vtterance, vnto a dore, or gate, of it selfe shut, which none is able to set o∣pen, but the Lord; indeed the word (doore) vsed Meta∣phorically, and by way of similitude, is sometimes put to signifie occasion, as Paul saith, 1 Cor. 16.9. A great doore and effectuall is opened vnto me, (that is) a great oportunity or occasion of preaching, and spreading of the Gospell is offered vnto me, but heere being put with the addition (of vtterance or speach) we are to vnderstand by it the mouth, the instrument of speech, which is as the dore or passage of speech, and the opening of that doore, which is onely from the Lord, as the Apostle heere saith, (that God may open unto vs the word of vtterance) doth imply two things. First, a giuing of a power and abilitie of speaking, and of vtterance, all naturall impediments beeing remooued; and taken away, a facultie to speake and vtter things with∣out any impediment, and a giuing of liberty of speech and vtterance without any outward let or hinderance. Thus then wee are to vnderstand these words, as if the Apostle had said; Pray for mee and Timotheus, that the Lord (who is onely able) would vouchsafe to set open our mouthes, that of themselues are shut, and not able to vtter a word, and that hee would make them as open gates and dores, thorow which speach and vtterance may passe, that our mouthes may be able to speake and vtter foorth things without any naturall impediment, and that they may speake freely without any outward let or hin∣derance. First, heere consider we, what it is that the Apostle de∣sired the Colossians to pray for that the Lord would giue to him, and Tymothy, (namely) this, that God would o∣pen to them the dore of vtterance, that hee would giue
them ability, and liberty of speech, and vtterance to preach the Gospell of Christ; he desires them not to pray that the Lord would giue them power to worke miracles, that they might be able to heale the sicke, or the like, but that they would pray, that the dore of vtterance might be opened to them. Hence then we may easily see. That an open doore of vtterance, a mouth able to  speake, and vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell, is most needfull for the Lords Minister,A mouth able to vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell is absolutely needfull for the Lords Mi∣nister. yea it is a thing of abso∣lute necessitie, without which, none can be a good Mini∣ster; let a man haue neuer so much learning, and know∣ledge in his head, yet if hee want ability, conueniently and with some grace to vtter, and expresse the same, hee is not fit for that holy function, and for the seruice of the Ministrie of the Gospell. Malak. 2.7. The Prophet said in time of the old Testament, That the Priests lips should pre∣serue knowledge, it should not be onely in his head, but in his lips, and they should seeke the Law at his mouth, and his mouth should be able to vtter it. And he giues this reason of it; For he is the Messenger  of the Lord of hostes: and if that reason were then good, as doubtlesse it was, then must it needes bee now much more a good reason, to proue that the lips of the Minister of the Gospell ought to preserue knowledge, and that his mouth should bee able to vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell, because he is the Ambassador of Christ, 2 Cor. 5 20. And being the Ambassador of the Lord to his peo∣ple, it followeth necessarily that he must be able and apt to deliuer his ambassage vnto them. Againe, the people attaine their faith ordinarily by hea∣ring,  Rom. 10.17. Faith is by hearing, and therefore it must needes be, that the Minister must be able by speaking, to beget faith in them, and to confirme the same, as the A∣postle speakes plainely, Verse 14. How shall they heare without a Preacher, without one to open and to vtter forth
to them the doctrine of the Gospell. And hence it is, that the Apostle in the description of one that is to be chosen to that great office of the Mini∣strie, requireth chiefly, that he be apt to teach, 1 Tim. 3.2. It is then a cleare point, that an open doore of vtterance, a mouth able to vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell, is a thing most requisite, and ought to be found in some mea∣sure in euery Minister of the Gospell. How then can they bee held sufficient Ministers of the Gospell,Dumbe Mini∣sters are insuf∣ficient mini∣sters of the Gospell. who are altogether destitute of the gift of vtte∣rance, are dumbe and cannot speake, and haue no manner of abilitie to vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell? Ad∣mitte they haue all the vertues and good properties that can commend a man in the world besides, yet wanting this they want that which is most needfull, yea absolutely needefull, without which they cannot be fit for the worke of the Ministrie; yet many such haue crept into that cal∣calling, and still lurke in the Church, and it being a mat∣ter of such great and absolute necessitie to vtter foorth the secrets of the Gospell. Wee for our parts, are to blesse God for his mercy to∣wards any people,Wee are to blesse God for giuing a mini∣ster to a peo∣ple able and fit to publish the secrets of the Gospel, & to pitty them tha want such a minister. where we see a Minister set ouer them that hath knowledge and a competent gift of vtterance fit for the publishing of the Gospel, and conscience to vse it, the Lord hath visited that people with a speciall fa∣uour. And we are to pitty that people to whom the Lord hath denied that mercy, and suffered them to liue vnder a Minister that hath no manner of abilitie that way: there case is pitifull indeed, for howsoeuer Christ hath done suf∣ficient for the saluation of all the world, yet they want the ordinarie meanes whereby the benefit of redemption might be applied to them, and so their case is lamentable, happily they see it not, and in that respect it is more pitti∣full, and we are to put on tender bowels, and in pittie and compassion toward them, to pray to the Lord as our Sa∣uiour hath taught vs, Matth. 9.38. that hee would send
to them such workemen, as for knowledge, vtterance, and other gifts are both fit, able, and willing also, to make knowne, and to open vnto them the secrets and sweete comforts of the Gospell. In the next place in that the Apostle doth intreate the Colossians to pray for him and Timothy, that the Lord would set open their mouthes, and that hee would make them able to vtter the secrets of the Gospell. We are further taught. That GOD onely doth open the doore of vtte∣rance,  hee onely giues ability and libertie of speach;God onely giues abilitie and liberty of speech. not onely the knowledge of holy things, and of the Myste∣ries of Christ, but euen words to vtter them is from the Lord. Let a man haue neuer so much knowledge, and be as full of good matter, as was Elihu, Iob 32.18. Yet vnlesse the Lord put words into his mouth, hee shall bee dumbe and not able to vtter it, Exod. 4.11.12. Wee finde that Moses pleading his infirmity, and that hee was not elo∣quent, but a man of slow speech, and slow of tongue, the Lord said vnto him, who hath giuen the mouth? As hee had said, dost thou not consider, that I onely giue ability and power to speake, to whom I will, and that I take it away at my pleasure? Therefore goe thy way, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach thee what thou shalt say. Psalm. 51.14. Dauid intreating the Lord to deliuer him from bloud, hee promiseth that his tongue should sing ioifully of his righteousnesse. Yet in the next verse, as if hee had forgot himselfe, and not said well, in say∣ing, my tongue shall sing ioifully of thy righteousnesse; hee makes his prayer to the LORD, that hee would open his lippes, that his mouth might speake to his praise. Plainely shewing. That though the LORD should, according to his
request, giue him the matter of praise, and thankesgiuing, and he should conceiue it in his minde, yea put matter in∣to his mouth; yet, vnlesse the Lord did adde a further grace and mercy, euen to open his lips, he should not bee able to vtter it. And the reason of this is, that wee finde, Act. 17.28. In the Lord wee liue, moue, and haue our being; euery motion of soule and bodie, (as it is a motion) is from the Lord; without his helpe and assistance we are not able to mooue the least finger to the doing of any outward ciuill thing, and therefore much more doth he alone vnlose the strings of our tongues, and giue ability and liberty of speach to vtter foorth holy things, and the mysteries of the Gos∣pell. Confutation of free will as the Papists teach it.Hence I might take occasion to shew the errour of the Papists, the patrons and defenders of free will, who teach a freedome of will, euen in the will it selfe, and of it selfe in spiriuall things; but if euery mo∣tion of body and soule be from the Lord, and wee are not able to moue any faculy of the one, or part of the other, but as we are helped and assisted by the Lord, then there can be no freedome of wll, in the will it selfe, and by it selfe, in ciuill good things; indeed, we willingly acknow∣ledge a liberty of will, to will spirituall good in the state of grace, after regeneraton; yet not a liberty in the will it selfe, but by the continuall assisting grace of God, the will truely changed and renued, hath freedome to will that which is good, yet not by it selfe, but by the continu∣all  assistance of Gods grace. A Minister of the word that knowes holy things and hath thought vpon them must intreate the Lord to enable him to vtter them.Now is it so, that God onely doth open the dore of vt∣terance▪ and that a man hauing neuer so much knowledge cannot vtter it vnlesse God open his mouth. Surely then, the Minister of the word must not rest in his knowledge and meditation, but hee must humbly craue it of the Lord, that he may be able to vtter the holy things he hath thought vpon.
And heere (by the way to touch it) if the Minister of the word cannot vtter the holy things he hath studied and thought vpon; vnlesse the Lord giue him vtterance, how then is it possible, that one being not a Minister, nor euer cald on to that office should be able to vtter them?A Minister of the word be∣ing not able to vtter the holy things he hath studied & thought vp on, vnles God giue him vtte∣rance, much lesse can o∣thers that are no Ministers be able to do it. How can one that comes from a manuary trade to Preach (as it is sometimes among Brownists.) How (I pray you) can such a man thinke, that hee shall bee able to vtter holy things, and to speake as a Minister in a Congregation, or in a meeting of Christians. Obiect: The Lord can enable him so to speake, I grant it, that is without question, the Lord can, but whether he will or no, thereof I make some doubt, and I haue reason for it, because indeede, such an one doth thrust himselfe into an office to which he is not cald, and therefore cannot pray to the Lord to open to him the doore of vtterance, to speake as a Minister with any assu∣rance te be heard. Admit this,  (which happely will bee further obiected) that such a man hath the allowance of them that ioine with him, hee thinkes himselfe able, and they allow him, and designe him to the office of teaching. What then, is he therefore rightly called to that office?  I doubt of that also, because hee cannot ordinarily haue that abilitie, and those gifts that are necessarie for the fur∣nishing of an ordinarie Minister of the Gospell, he being brought vp to a Mechanicall trade, and so wanting the helpe of Arts and tongues, cannot ordinarily haue the gift of true interpretation of Scripture, and right diuiding of the word, in a publike meeting of Christians, which is a matter of great difficultie, and of the greatest learning. The Lord (if he please) can giue gifts extraordinarily, but (as one saith well) at the first comming of the Gospell, the Lord did stirre vp simple men extraordinarily, when the Vniuersities were the greatest enemies of Religion; but now hauing restored to vs the plenty of Canaan, we must
know that the date of extraordinarie calling is expired, and therefore such a man as comes suddenly from a manuary trade to preach the word, cannot looke that the LORD should open to him the doore of vtterance to publish the secrets of the Gospell. No, no, a Minister of the Gos∣pell, lawfully called, and fitted for that office, must craue it at the Lords hands, that hee may bee able to vtter the secrets of the Gospell. Prou. 16 1. The preparations of the heart are in man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. The meaning is, that a man may haue, as it were, whole armies of thoughts in his minde, and those by long medi∣tation orderly disposed, yet the vttermost of his minde is, as God shall open his mouth, he cannot vtter aright any part of that matter he hath thought on, vnlesse the Lord giue him the gift of vtterance, and at his hands it must be thought for. Againe, is it so, that God onely doth open the dore of vtterance, and he onely giues ability and liberty of speach to his Ministers? Then wee may easily conceiue, where wee are to seeke and sue for abilitie and libertie of speech, to the Ministers of the Gospell, euen at the hands of the LordAbility and liberty of speech to the minister of the Gospell, must be sought for at the hands of the Lord. by earnest and heartie praier, who onely it is, that must giue it, and withall it behooues vs to take heede wee prouoke not the Lord to shut vp that door of vtterance: for as it is, Reuel. 3 7. If he open none can shut, and if he shut none can open. Now we by our sinnes prouoke the Lord to locke vp the dore of vtterance, euen to take away, either abilitie or libertie of speech from his Ministers, when men walke not worthy the Gospell, Phil. 1.27. They iustly pro∣uoke the Lord, either to send foolish teachers, or to stop the mouths of such as are wise and able to diuide the word of God aright, and not to suffer them to speake any more in his name to them. If the Minister haue the dore of vt∣terance,Note. and haue his mouth opened to tell thee of thy sinnes, and the danger of them, and thou hast not a dore of vterance, thou wilt not suffer the word to enter into
thine heart and to worke in thee a reformation, but thou doest still please thy selfe in thy sinnes, and in following the lusts of thyne owne heart. What doest thou? surelie prouoke the Lord either by death, or some other way to silence the Minister, and to stop his mouth: therefore consider it, and if we desire abilitie and libertie of speech, to the Ministers of the Gospell: let vs heartily and ear∣nestly, sue for it at the Lords handes, let vs take heede, wee prouoke him not by our sinnes to take away these thinges from them: if wee humbly seeke for it, that the Lord would open the dore of vtterance to his Ministers; and if wee open our owne hearts, and suffer the word of GOD to enter into them, then (doubtlesse) where the dore is opened, the LORD will open it wyder, and hold it open, maugre the malice of the Diuell and all the power of Hell. Note wee one thinge further; Paul (noe doubt) had the dore of vtterance opened to him; hee had abillitie, and some libertie to vtter the secrets of the Gospell, though he was a prisoner, as appeares Act. 28.31. and yet heere he desires the Colossians to pray, that God would open vnto him the dore of vtterance: hence we may gather. That a man that hath the gift of vtterance ought, not  withstanding, to pray, and to desire others to pray for the continuance and increase of that gift,He that hath the gift of vt∣terance, ought to pray and to intreat others to pray for the continuance nd increase o that gift. that the LORD would continnue it to him and more and more in∣crease it. If a man haue his house full of foode, and prouision laid vp for a whole yeare, yea for many yeares, yet he must still pray: giue vs this day our dayly bread; and still pray that the Lord would giue him the vse of those things, and giue them power and strength to doe him good. So if a man bee stronge to followe his labour, and bee neuer so able to doe the workes of his callinge; yet hee must still craue strength and assistance from the Lord, that the LORD would blesse his strength and giue
him the right vse of it, and continue it to him. Now this is a thing either not knowne or little regarded of many. They rush vpon the workes of their callings pre∣suming on their owne strength,Reproofe of those who rush vpon the works of their callings presu∣ming on their own strength. the Lord therefore doth sometimes blow vpon their strength and suddenly turnes it to weakenesse. Hauing now handled the matter which the Apostle in∣treated the Colossians to pray for, in the behalfe of him∣selfe and Timothy, come wee to the end and purpose for which hee desired that ability and liberty might be giuen them in these words (to speake the myst ry of Christ) the A∣postle desired that the dore of vtterance might be opened to him and Timothy, for the publishing and preaching of the Gospell, the excellency whereof hee sets out by two ar∣guments. First, by the high and heauenly matter of it containing in it heauenly mysteries of Christ, and Secondly, by the worth of it in respect of the greatest affliction, that it is a doctrine so excellent, as it is worth the suffering for, to the losse of liberty; yea and life too, if the professors of it be thereunto called, and the Apostle saith that hee for the professing and preaching of the Gospell, doubted not to expose himselfe to trouble, and to bee bound with chaines as an euill doer, and so by his owne suffring for it, he proues the excellency of it, in these words (wherefore I am also in bonds.) Interpre∣tation.Let vs first clear the words touching the sence and mea∣ning of them (to speake) that is, to publish, declare; and by speech to make knowne (the mystery of Christ) that is, the doctrine of the Gospell, for so the Apostle cals it, Ephe∣sians 6.19. The secret of the Gospell. Now the Gospell i called the mysterie of Christ because Christ is the sub∣subiect matter of it, and hee is the very substance of the Gospell, the Gospell containing in it the doctrine of Christ his incarnation and offices, his humiliation, his ex∣atation, his humanity, his diuinity, his office of me∣diation,
and all things concerning the life and death of Christ. And againe: The Gospell is called a mystery, because it is wonderfull deepe, secret and vnsearchable, such an excellent, and withall, such an hidden thing, as the vnderstanding and knowledge of it cannot be attained by anie wit of man, no nor of Angels, who are therefore said to stoope downe to look into the maruellous work of redemption, and the se∣crets of the Gospell, 1. Pet. 1.12. (Wherefore I am also in bonds) these words haue no difficultie in them, the mea∣ning of them is briefly this, for which excellent doctrine of the Gospell I also suffer restraint of my liberty, and am imprisoned and bound in prison. In the first place obserue we heere that our Apostle de∣sired abilitie and libertie of vtterance to bee giuen to him and Timethie, for this end and purpose, that they might publish and declare, and by speaking make knowen the doctrine of the Gospell, they desired not that gift for their owne praise, that they might seeme learned, (for without the gift of vtterance, a mans learning lies hid as a Iewell in a darke place) or for their owne profitte, that they might bee more liberally rewarded by the Church, but that they might by speech vtter foorth, and declare the secrets of the Gospell, heere then iust occasion is giuen to shew that the gift of vtterance bestowed on a Minister of the Gospell both ought to bee vsed, and not to bee as a talent hid and wrapped vp in a napkin, and that it ought to bee vsed to a right end, not to his owne praise, nor his owne profit, but to the publishing of the secrets of the Gospell, so as may be most for the glorie of God, and the good of his people, but on these things I will not stand, let it suffice onely to haue named them. In that the Apostle desires the gift of speech to speake the mystery of Christ, and by speech to make knowen the doctrine of the Gospell.
We may easily see, that spaeking or preaching of the word by the tongue of man, iustified and prooued to vs, Verbum vocale, (as it is called) a publishing, a making knowen of the doctrine of the word by the voyce of man,The preach∣ing of the word, by the tongue and voice of man, thereunto cal∣led, is a thing lawfull and necessarie. is warranted, it is a thing that may and ought to bee vsed, yea, it is a matter of necessity, it is needfull, that the do∣ctrine of the word be made knowen by the speech of man as may easily be prooued. For as the Apostle saith, Rom. 1.10. the Gospell is the  power of God to saluation, but to whom? to euerie one generally without exception of anie? no, but to euery one that beleeueth, so doth the Apostle limit that power, and how is faith wrought by the bare letter and sentence of the Gospell, recorded in the written word? no, but by the Gospell preached, Rom. 10.14. How shall they beleeue without a Preacher, for the wor∣king of faith the Gospell must bee heard, and not onely heard by the bare repetition of the sentence of it, but heard preached (that is) the secret mysteries of it opened, and applyed by the voyce and speech of man called to that office. And there is yet further reason for it, namely this, the sentence of the Gospell is generall, the promises of life, and saluation, are indefinitely propounded in the written word, whosoeuer beleeues in the sonne of God shall bee saued, &c. and they are aboue the reach of naturall vnder∣standing, such as naturall reason cannot comprehend, and generals, of that nature must needes bee vnprofita∣ble, if they bee not vnfolded and applied, and therefore it is needefull that the doctrine of the Gospell should bee published and made knowen by the preaching of men called to that function, and the Lord hath ordained that men called to teach the Gospell, should by speaking vtter foorth the secrets of it, and in his name should expound and applie the same to the persons of their hearers parti∣cularly.
First this crosseth the foolish conceit of the Anabaptists and familists who hould that the publique ministerie and  teaching of the worde by the voice and speech of man is needelesse,The opinion of Anabap∣tists and Fa∣milists who denie the tea∣ching of the word by the ministrie of man, ouer∣throwen. they alleadge for defence of their opinion that of Iere. 31.34. where the Prophet foretels that in the time of the Gospell, vnder the new Testament, men should no more teach euery man his neighbour and e∣uery man his brother, saying, know the Lord, but they should all know him from the least of them vnto the grea∣test of them. Therfore (say they) teaching now by the voice of man  is needlesse. Answer, the Prophets meaning is,  that Gods elect in the time of the new Testament sheuld not onely be taught by the outward mistery and speech of man, but inwardly al∣so by the Spirit of God, as appeares in the verse before, I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall bee my people. Oh but saith the Familist,  if that be the meaning of the Prophet, then saint Iohn 1. Ioh. 2.27. hath shewed it to bee needlesse to be taught by the voyce of man. The annoin∣ting (saith he) (that is) the Spirit which ye haue receiued of him dwelleth in you, and yee need not that any man teach you. Againe, the meaning of Saint Iohn is,  that the elect ha∣uing receiued the spirit need not that any man shold teach them to discerne truth taught, from errour and deceit, but are inwardly taught by the Spirit, and haue their mindes enlightned, and their iudgements cleered, to discerne be∣tweene trueth and errour, and that this is his meaning, it is cleerely affirmed in the verse before, these things haue I written vnto you concerning them that doe de∣ceiue you, and so (notwithstanding these exceptions bee made) it remaineth a trueth, that it is very need∣full that the doctrine of the written word of God be made
knowen by the speech of man called to speake, and that by vtterance and speech it be opened and applyed to the hearers for their instruction and comfort. And let this serue to order our conceit and estimation, touching the speaking of the worde,Wee are to e∣steeme the preaching of the word by the voice of man called to that office, not a thing needlesse or arbitrary, but an holy ordi∣nance of God by the voyce and tongue of man, called to that office. Let vs not thinke and esteeme it as a needelesse thing, or a matter arbitrarie, left to our choyce to heare, or not to heare at our pleasure, it is most needefull for the wor∣king of sauing knowledge and faith, and learne thou to account it as the ordinance of God to that purpose, and if thou know not GOD as hee hath made himselfe known in his Worde, thou knowest him not to thy com∣fort. Now thou canst not know GOD, as hee is reuealed in his word ordinarily, but by his word opened and ap∣plied by the speech of man called to that office, and therefore bee not thou either so vnthankefull to God for his mercie in appointing man like to thy selfe, to teach thee, or so iniurious to thy selfe, as lightly to regard the word spoken to thee, by the ministry of man. Now this is a thing wherof the Ministers of the word, haue iust cause to complaine in this decrepit and wicked age of the world, some thinke they know as much as hee that speakes can tell them, and men now (for the most part) if they come to heare the worde preached, make small reckoning of the doctrine of the worde, made knowen to them by the speech of man called to that office, especially of the doctrine of the Law, if their sinnes bee discouered, and the danger wherein they are by rea∣son of their sinnes, and the iudgements due to their sinne bee denounced against them, they thinke those are but the wordes of men, the wordes of their Preachers, and no such thing shall come vnto them, and they blesse themselues in their owne hearts, and still goe on in their sinne.
Now then seeing the speaking of the word is so light∣ly regarded, and vocall speaking doth so little good, wee may iustly looke, that the Lord should cause that to cease, and now come amongst vs with reall sermons, euen his plagues and iudgements, the heauens seeme to threaten iudgement that they shall bee as brasse, and the earth as iron. Let vs therefore be warned in time, whilest the word is yet sounding in our eares, by the voice of man, to make more account of it, let vs esteeme and reuerence the spea∣king of the word by the ministrie of man, as the ordinance of God, and make conscience of yeelding obedience vnto it, least the Lord seeing our light regard of that soft and fa∣miliar voice of man, hee take that from vs, and send out his fearefull thundering voyce of iudgement, that seeing wee refuse to yeelde our selues flexible to the one, wee may bee broken and crushed, and shattered in pceccs by the other. In the next place, let it bee obserued that the doctrine of the Gospell containing the doctrine of Christ his incar∣nation and offices, his life and death, is heere called the ministrie of Christ, a doctrine deepe and secret, farre a∣boue the reach of mans witte and vnderstanding, the consideration of this doth offer vnto vs this conclu∣sion. That it is no easie mattet truely to vnderstand, know  and beleeue the doctrine of the Gospell,It is no easie matter truely to vnderstand and beleeue the doctrin of the Gospell. a man cannot easilie come to haue knowledge, and faith in the secrets of the Gospell, in the doctrine of Christ his incarnation; his office of mediation, his two natures, personall vnion of them, and other things needefull to bee knowen and beleeued. And hence it is that the Apostle saith, 1. Timoth. 3.16. without controuersie, the doctrine of godlinesse, that is, the Gospell containing matter of Christ his person and offices, that doctrine is not onely a mysterie, but a great
mysterie, and an exceeding profoundnesse and depth, and that without all question or controuersie, the word signi∣fieth by all mens confession, that is an axiome or trueth, held and confessed of all, that the doctrine touching Christ his person and offices, is not easily conceiued, no not by the best naturall wits, it were easie to giue instance in particulars, 1. Corinth. 1.23. Wee preach Christ cruci∣fied, to the Iewes a stumbling blocke, and vnto the Gre∣cians foolishnesse (saith the Apostle) Act. 17.15. The Athenians, the wisest of the Heathen, and the wisest a∣mong the Philosophers, when Paul preached to them Ie∣sus, and the resurrection, they sayd he was a babler, a tri∣fler or setter foorth of strange gods. The reason  of this is plaine, namely this. There is no feede of the doctrine of Christ in nature, the morall Law was written in nature before the fall, and since there is some remnants of it in vs, Rom. 2.15. the Gentiles shew the effect of the Law written in their hearts their consciences also bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one another or excusing. But the doctrine of Iesus Christ incarnate, the media∣tour of the new testament, is aboue the reach of nature created, much more of nature corrupted. And therefore it is no easie matter truely to know and  beleeue the secrets of the Gospell, and this serues to wipe away a vile slander throwen vppon our Church by the Papists.A slnder trowen vpon our Church by the Papists remooued. They say wee teach an easie way to saluation, in that we say to men according to the doctrine of the Gos∣pell, repent and beleeue in Christ, and thou shalt be saued, behold (saith the Papist) an easie way to be saued; is it so? can it bee an easie thing for a man by faith to appre- Christ and his merittes, and to apply them to himselfe to his comfort, and yet bee an hard matter for a man, truely to know, vnderstand and beleeue the doctrine of Christ? can one of these bee hard and the other easie, it is not possible, and therefore it is a meere slander cast vp∣on
vs by the Papists that wee teach an easie way to saluation, rather (indeed) they teach an easie way to sal∣uation by implicite faith. But let vs further thinke on the doctrine deliuered to this purpose, is it so, that it is no easie matter to know and beleeue the doctrine of Christ because there is no seed of it in nature? Then deceiue not thy selfe, thinke not that thou dost  truely beleeue in Christ to thy comfort,A faith easily has is no true faith, & here∣in many de∣ceiue them∣selues. when thou hast onely such a faith as may be easily had, a faith conceiued without any hardnes, a faith conceiued only by tradition which (indeed) is the faith of the greatest number in the world, they hauing beene borne and bred, and brought vp in the bosome of the Church, and hauing heard it deliuered in the Church, that Iesus Christ came into the world, tooke our nature vpon him, and in that nature suf∣fered death vpon the crosse, and gaue himselfe a ransome for all men: thereupon they conceiue in minde a motion, and a bare conceit, that Christ is their Sauiour, and they can repeate all the Articles of the Creed, and presently (as they imagine) stedfastly beleeue them, neuer finding any hardnesse, or any vnbeliefe in their hearts, in respect of ane one article. If thy faith in Christ be such a faith, it is no true faith. If thou neuer yet felt the mighty and po∣werfull word of God, or the working of his mightie power as the Apostle speakes Ephesians 1.19. Working in thee vnderstanding and faith in the Gospell, and in the doctrine of Christ, certainely thou hast no true faith but a fancy. The doctrine of CHRIST his incarnation and Offices, is a doctrine full of great mysteries which cannot bee comprehended without much hardnesse, and striuing against naturall vnbeliefe, and knowe for a truth, that thou dost neuer beleeue the Gospell to thy comfort, till thou canst say, with a true feeling of thine owne weakenenesse, and want of faith, as hee said in the
Gospell, Lord I beleeue, Lord helpe mine vnbeleefe. A faith easily conceiued without feeling any hardnesse and strug∣gling against vnbeleefe, is but a loose imagination, in time of triall, either temptation, or great affliction, that faith will faile thee, it is a faith of nature, and reason, and not of the Spirit, and when nature and reason faile that can∣not stand. Therefore deceiue not thy selfe, neuer rest till thou finde in thee a faith conceiued, by the vse of the meanes, hearing of the word preached, meditation, praier, and such like, and wrought in thee by a supernaturall power, ouermastring thy naturall hardnesse, and vnbeliefe, thou maiet bee sure, that a faith so wrought, is a faith of Gods Spirit, and that faith will neuer faile, the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against it. From the doctrine deliuered we may further gather; Whence it comes to passe that men of finest wits, and greatest learning, yet erre in the doctrine of Christ his in∣carnation, and off ces,Whence it is that men of excellent wits and greatest learning doe notwithstan∣ding erre in the doctrin of Christ his in∣carnation and offices. and are not able rightly to con∣ceiue them, and they are as a sealed Booke vnto them, Isai. 29.11. Euen from hence, these things are deepe my∣steries, the true knowledge of them cannot bee reached by the best wit in the world, it is onely the Spirit of God, that must open, and reueale them; and if the Lord haue vouchsafed that mercy to thee, and giuen thee a true vn∣derstanding of them, thou being a simple poore man or woman; Oh blesse his name for that great mercy, he hath vouchsafed that to thee, which he hath denied to thou∣sands besides, as good as thou by nature; yea, to many liuing vnder the same meanes with thee, therefore thou hast great cause to blesse God for his mercy, and to say with Christ, Matth. 11.25. I thanke thee oh Father, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of vnderstanding, and hast ope∣ned them vnto babes, to mee a poore silly creature, and simple man, or woman; yea, let thy heart, tongue and
life, expresse and set foorth the great mercy of God to∣wards thee in that respect. Come we to the matter of doctrine offered from the second argument, heere setting out the excellency of the Gospell (namely) the Apostles suffering for it, expressed in the last wordes of this verse (wherefore or for which I am also in bonds.) Now in that the Apostle saith that the doctrine of the Gospell is not onely a doctrine full of high and hidden mysteries, and in that respect an excellent doctrine, but that for it also he refused not to suffer imprisonment, and losse of his liberty, and in that regard also a doctrine of great excellency and dignity we may esily conceiue. That the sufferings of such as professe the Gospell,The excellen∣cie of the gos∣pell appeares clearely tho∣row the suffe∣rings of such as trulie professe it. bee they Ministers, or others, the afflictions that are throwne vpon true professors of the Gospell, for the profession, of it, are so farre from beeing an argument against the worthinesse of the doctrine of the Gospell, as that they much cleere, and strongly prooue the excellency of the same, euen through the sufferings of the true professors of the Gospell, doth the excellency of the same ap∣peare, For why? Therein appeare plainely, the power,  the vertue, and the glory of the Gospell, that it is a most pow∣erfull and glorious doctrine. Were it not so, were not the Gospell full of power to vphold the professors of it in the time of their sufferings, doubtlesse they would not suffer for it, with such boldnesse, confidence, and con∣stancy as they doe, sometimes to the shedding of their bloud, and losse of their liues; and were there not a glo∣rie in the Gospell to ouershaddowe the shame of it, and were not men well assured of the excellency of the do∣ctrine of the Gospell, for which they suffer; without que∣stion, they would neuer so cheerefully, and with reioicing (as they doe) endure for it the extreamest torments that their persecutors can deuise to lay vpon them, and there∣fore
we may safely say that the sufferings of such as pro∣fesse the Gospell, euen their suffering for the Gospels sake, doe much cleare and manifest the excellency of the gos∣pell, and shew foorth the glory of it, and tend much to the aduancement of it. The Apostle affirmes it plainely, Philip. 1.12. That the things hee suffered for the Gospell, his afflictions, his bonds, had turned rather to the confir∣mation and aduancement of the Gospell, then other∣wise. Now then, is it so, that the afflictions of the Ministers and others, for the Gospels sake, set out the dignitie and excellency of it? See then, how that which the Deuill thinke will be a meanes to disgrace the Gospell, and the profession of it, the Lord turnes to a meanes to bring glo∣rie to it.That which the deull thinkes will be a meanes to disgrace the Gospell the Lord tunes to bee a meanes to bring glory to it. The Gospell being most repugnant to the ty∣ranny of Satan, the manners of the wicked world, and the corruption of our sinfull flesh, the Deuill and his instru∣ments bestirre themselues against it, and pursue the pro∣fessors of it, with many indignities and much hard mea∣sure, thinking thereby to make the Gospell it selfe odious, and to bring the profession of it into contempt and dis∣grace; but altogether in vaine, the more they labour by afflicting the professors of the Gospel, to disgrace the Gos∣pell and the profession of it, the more doe they cleare the excellency and glory, both of the Gospell, and of the true profession of it, and such as haue their eies opened by the Spirit of God, are able euen through the afflictions of the professors of the Gospell, to see and discerne that excellen∣cie and glory; indeed carnall, and worldly minded men, see no manner of beauty nor glory at all in the Gospell, and the profession of it, being vnder many sufferings, they hold the sincere profession of the Gospell base, and con∣temptible, and why so? Because as it is Act. 28.22. that waies euerie where spoken against, because it lies vnder many nicknames, and reproachfull tearmes, but if thine eies be opened by the spirit of God, thou seest euen tho∣row
those reproches and disgracefull termes, a glorious  lustre, and bright shining glory of that holy profession,Men looke not vpon the true profes∣sion of the Gospel with a right eie till they see the beauty of it thorow ma∣ny and great afflictions. and thou dost not looke on the true profession of the Gos∣spell with a right eie, with an eie opened and cleared by the Spirit of God, till thou see the beauty and glory of it, lying vnder many and great afflctions and sufferings, the more the world seekes to disgrace the Gospell, and the true professors of it, the more the glorie of it appeares, the brighter it shines, and if thou see it not, thou lookest on it with a carnal eie, and there is no more comfort of the Gos∣pell belonging to thee, then to one that is carnall, and therefore if thou wouldest find the comfort that belongs to a true professor of the Gospell, neuer rest till thou be able to see, and discerne the excellency, and glorie of the Gospell, and the sincere profession of it, manifested, and made cleare by the suffering of true professors, yea neuer rest till thou bee, not onely, not discouraged, but as the Apostle said of some in his time, Phil. 1.14 more embold∣ned and heartned to go on in a constant profession of the Gospell, by the sufferings of others for the same. Let not the indignities and reproches throwne on the true pro∣fessors of the Gospell make thee more out of heart, and more out of loue with the profession of the Gospell, if they doe, thy heart is not right within thee. In the next place obserue wee that the Apostle making mention of his sufferings, and in particular, of his impri∣sonment, hee specifieth the cause of it, he tels the Colos∣sians, hee was in prison and bonds, and that not for any misdemeanor, for any crime committed, by him deser∣uing bonds, but for the heauenly doctrine of the Gos∣pell, that his professing and preaching the Gospell, was the cause wherefore he was imprisoned, and that for it hee was in bonds. Whence we are taught thus much. That of the same kinde of calamities, and sufferings
ha befall the godly, and the vngodly, of the same kinde of suffering, that befall the children of God, and the wicked. There be different causes, though the calamities and sufferings, that are inflicted on men, as imprisonment, banishishment, sundry kindes of torments, and death, are common to the godly with the vngodly, and light on them both: yet the causes for which they suffer are diffe∣rent;Though the godly and the wicked many times suffer the same things, yet the cuses for which they suffer, are much diffe∣rent. the wicked they are punished for their wickednesse, and for their offences, but the godly, they are pressed by the wicked with many vexations, euen for their piety and religion, and so though they suffer the same things, yet not for the same cause. Wee may see it in many examples, Gen. 39.20. Wee read that Ioseph was imprisoned in the place where the Kings prisoners lay bound, and in the 40. Chapter verse 3. We finde also that Pharaohs two officers his chiefe Butler, and his Baker were cast into the same prison where Ioseph was, and so both Ioseph and they suf∣fered the same imprisonment, but the causes of their im∣prisonment were much different one from the other; Io∣seph he was put in prison at the false and slanderous accu∣sation of his mistresse, indeede the true cause was his refu∣sall to commit folly with her, and to sinne against God. But Pharaohs Officers were committed for their offences against their Lord and King, and iustly for their deserts. Wee haue example of this also in Christ and the two theeues that were crucified with him, both Christ and they were in the same condemnation, as one of the theeues said, Luk. 23.40. (that is) in the same iudgement, they suffered the same punishment, yet how different the cause of their suffering was, from the cause of Christ, wee know well, and one of the theeues did acknowledge it, verse 41. We are (indeed) saith hee, righteously heere, but this man hath done nothing amisse. This then is manifest that howsoeuer the godly and wicked bee vnder the same troubles, the same pressures,
and vexations, the godly are imprisoned and so are the wicked, yet not for the same cause, the godly they suffer vniustly, and for a good cause, the wicked they suffer iust∣lie, and for their euill doing. And this serueth. First, to iustifie and cleare that common receiued sen∣tence. Not the punishment, but the cause is that which makes the Martyr.That sentence justified, that not the punish¦ment but the cause makes the Martyr. He that suffers the same torments, and the same tortures that holy Martyrs doe, is not therefore a Martyr; no, no, it is the cause for which a man suffers that makes him a Martyr. A man may suffer some things that holy men of God doe, and yet be a wicked man, and suffer for his euill do∣ing, and this is the very case of Popish Martyrs.The case of popish Mar∣tyrs. The Pa∣pists, they canonize some for Saints, and register them for Martyrs, who haue suffered death for no lesse then monstrous treason against their Prince. Oh,  but say some (Catholikes) suffer imprisonment and death too, for their conscience, and for religion, and what say you to them? Are not they holy men and Mar∣tyrs? Surely no,  we tell them they must proue they suffer for conscience rightly informed, and for Orthodoxall sound and true religion, else can they not challenge the name of holy men and Martyrs. Now this they are neuer able to doe, their persecuted Catholikes (as they call them) suffer for superstition, and Antichristian heresie, and therefore cannot bee truly held as holy men and martyrs. But for the vse of this point to our selues,I is rash judg∣ment to con∣dem men for troublesome prsons, onely because they suffer neuer examining the cause of their suffering. is it so that how∣soeuer the godly and the wicked, both lye vnder the same trouble, and the same suffering; yet if for different causes: the one for sinne, the other for pyetie and religion, and for a good cause. Surely, then it must needs bee weake and
rash judgement, by and by to censure and condemne them for troublesome persons that suffer, neuer examining the cause for which they suffer: that cannot chuse but bee headdy and vntimely judgement, and we must take heede of it. And this must further teach euery one of vs, if wee suffer any thinge at the handes of men, to looke to the cause of our suffering; in thy suffering, look that the cause it be good, and not euill, as Peter hath exhorted. 1 Pet. 4.15. Let none of you suffer as an euill doer: stand not thou on thy suffering, a wicked man may suffer the same,  that a godly man doeth; but on thy suffering for a good cause,If we suffer a∣ny thing at the hands of men, we must look to the cause of our suffe∣ing, that we suffer for wel-doing. some men being justly smytten with the tongue of others, and hardly spoken of and that justly, they lying vnder an hard censure, and yet just; for their pride, their couetousnesse, their vncleanenesse, their faithlesse dea∣lings in couenantes, their defrauding, their circumuent∣ing, and goeing beyond others in barganing, and the like. What doe they? and how doe they commonly shift off the matter? oh (say they) men speake ill of me; but say all what they will, or can, I care not for it, better men then I haue beene ill spoken off: Christ himselfe had scarse a good word, when he was heere on the earth: it is true in∣deed, good men, and Christ, haue beene ill spoken off. But did Christ, and good men deserue it? did they euer prouoke others to it by their ill deeds? thou wilt say noe. Why then, doest thou not see what a deceiuing argument thou vsest? Good men and Christ, haue suffered in this kind: the hauey beene ill spoken off, I now suffer hard and ill speaches, and therefore I passe not for them, why? but thou thy selfe knowest, Christ and good men deserued not to bee ill spoken off; they haue beene ill spoken off vn∣iustly for well-doing, but thou iustly, for ill-doing, wilt thou then shrowd thy selfe vnder the example of Christ, and of good men, in regard of thy suffering? Thou de∣ceiuest thy selfe, if thou be ill spoken of, and thine owne conscience tell thee thou deseruest it, thinke not to shift
off the matter, and to finde comfort in saying Christ, and good men, haue beene ill spoken of, no, no, though they that speake ill of thee, and reuile thee, sin in so doing: yet there is no comfort in thy suffering. Indeed if thou bee ill spoken of vnjustly, or for a good cause; there is comfort in that suffering: some say some times, oh, if I had deserued such hard speeches, it would neuer grieue me. Thou speak∣est foolishly, if thou haddest deserued them, then were ther just cause of griefe: but not deseruinge them, there is noe cause of griefe at all, but rather of comfort, and rejoyceing, and therefore in thy suffering in this or any other kinde, e∣uer looke thou to the cause of thy suffering: if thou suffer justly, then bee humbled and repent of thy sinne, other wise the Lord will charge it more fully vppon thee, at the last day: if vnjustly, or for a good cause, with meekenes, and patience, possesse thy soule, and rejoyce, in that thou art partaker of Christ his sufferinges. 1. Peter. 4.13. And if thou bee rayled on for pyetie, and for religion (as hee sayeth) Verse 14. there is a blessinge belong∣ing to thee, and through thy sides they strike the spirit of glory. Obserue yet further, in that the Apostle was impriso∣ned for the Gospel, wee are playnelie taught. That for the Gospels sake, and for the true profession  of the same, wee must bee also ready to suffer imprison∣ment, and losse of libertie, yea, and losse of life too, if wee bee called vnto it. If then the case so stand, as wee must either loose our liues, or forsake the true profession of the Gospel.We must be ready to suffer losse of liberty and of life al∣so, if we be called vnto it, for the true profession of the Gospel. Luke. 14.20. saith our Sauiour: if a∣ny man come to mee, and hate not his father and mo∣ther, and wife, and children, and bretheren, and sist∣ers, yea and his owne life also: that is incomparison of mee, and of my Gospel; hee cannot bee my disciple. Therefore in the preparation of our heartes, wee must e∣uer bee readie to suffer any torture, or torment
for the Gospels sake, if the Lord vouchsafe vs that honor, and we be thereunto called. Now then is this a truth? ought true professours of the Gospell to be ready to lay downe their liues for the truth of the Gospell,  oh then how farre short are many in the world from such preparation?The failings of men in this particular du∣ty discouered. how know you that may some say? surely it is easily knowen, and I can easily make it plaine, are not many in the worlde, so wedded to the sensuall pleasures and profits in the world, as they will not forsake them, for the keeping of faith and a good conscience, they will not forsake any sensuall pleasure, or any vnlawfull gaine that comes in, for the keeping of faith and a good conscience, and can wee then thinke that such persons are prepared to forsake wife, children, house and land, and to suffer the losse of their liues by fire or sword if time of triall should come for the Gospels sake? no, no, there is no such matter, if the Gospell haue not beene powerfull in thee, and wrought in thee a deniall of vn∣godlinesse and worldly lusts, certainely thou art not pre∣pared to lay downe thy life for it, therefore deceiue not thy selfe, thou must be prepared to suffer imprisonment, & losse of libertie for the Gospels sake, if time of trial come vnto thee, and how soone it may come thou knowest not, and if it come, and thou bee not then prepared, a thou∣sand to one (without the extraordinarie mercie of God) thou wilt shrinke from Christ, and from the truth of his Gospell, and then woe bee to thee, Christ will deny thee, and be ashamed of thee, when hee shall come in his glory, Luke 9.26. therefore neuer rest till thou bee prepared to lay downe thy life for the Gospels sake, and to that end, neuer rest till the Gospell haue wrought powerfully in thee, a deniall of vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and taught thee to liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Tit. 2.12. and then (doubtlesse) thou art prepared to suffer any thing that shall bee layd vpon thee for the Gospels sake, and if the time of triall come vppon
thee, thou shalt be able (thorow Gods grace assisting thee) to seale thy profession of the Gospell with thy dearest bloud. VER. 4. That I may vtter it, as it becommeth mee to speake. In this verse the Apostle requires the praiers of the Co∣lossians for himselfe, more particularly, that they would lift vp their prayers to God for him more specially, that he being now in prison, and suffering for the Gospell, might with boldnesse, and all corrupt feare set apart, be able to vtter forth the secrets of the Gospell (that I may vtter) and withall, he sets downe in what manner he desired that he might vtter it, namely, in such manner as was meete and fit for him to speake. That I may vtter it the word (it) hath relation to that which went before (namely) the mystery of the doctrine of the Gospell,Interpre∣tation. and the word heere rendred (vtter) signi∣fies to manifest, and to make plaine, and cleare, that I may discouer and lay open the secrets of it, that I may make manifest, plaine and cleere, that deepe and hidden doctrine of the Gospell as it becommeth me to speake, or as I ought to speake, for so the words are translated, Eph. 6.20. which wordes are not to bee taken as some haue taught as a reason of that which goeth before drawen from the necessitie of dutie, as if the Apostles meaning were that I may vtter the doctrine of the Gospell, because I ought to speake it, and because I am bound by necessitie of dutie: but as expressing the manner, in what manner, he desired that he might vtter it, as if hee had sayd; that I may vtter it in such manner as I ought, and as it becom∣meth
mee, and this Decorum and manner of speaking must bee vnderstood as hauing a double relation, both to the excellency of the doctrine of the Gospell it selfe, and to the office and calling of the Apostle. The Apostle heere meant such a manner of speaking as was meet and fit, both in regard of the excellency of the Gospell, and of that trust or Apostleship that was reposed in him, thus then wee are to conceiue the wordes of this verse, as if the Apostle had sayd. I entreat you to pray for mee more specially beeing a prisoner, that I may bee able by speech to manifest and make plaine that deepe and hid∣den doctrine of the Gospell, in such manner of speaking, as is meete and fit, both in regard of the excellencie of the Gospell it selfe, and of that trust of Apostleshippe that is reposed in mee. Now here it is not to be passed by without obseruation, that the Apostle entreated the praiers of the Colossians for himselfe more speciallie, that hee being now in trou∣ble for the Gospell, in prison and in bonds, for the preach∣ing of it, they would he mindfull of him, and recommend him to God in their praiers, especially and aboue others, that now in time of his triall hee might bee strengthened, and not shrinke backe for feare, nor by any sinister and corrupt affection, bee diuerted, and turned aside from a sound and sincere vtterance and manifestation of the truth of the Gospell, but that he might vtter it, and de∣liuer it as it ought to be deliuered; Hence wee may note briefely. That howsoeuer we are to recommend all, both Mini∣sters and other professors of the Gospell to God by praier, yet
espe∣cially those that are in trouble, those that suffer imprison∣ment  or in any other kinde, for the truth of the Gospel;We are espe∣cially to re∣member in our prayers, those that suf∣fer for the truth of the Gospel. we are to remember them in our prayers especially, yea as the Apostle saith, Rom. 15.30. to striue and to be most ea∣nest and instant in prayer to God for them: and there is great reason for it. Because indeed in time of suffering, and tryall, the Di∣uell will be most busie, both by inward suggestions,  and by outward assaults, both of terrours, and flatteryes; and that corruption of nature that is least in the dearest Saints of God; will then bee workinge, and howsoeuer in time of calme: many men hold on a constant course in the pro∣fession of the Gospel, and liue vnblameably in the sight of men, yet many times their weakenes, and sometimes their hipocrysie, shewes it selfe when the storme of persecution is risen, and they are tossed with the winde of trouble; and therefore our part is in praying for others, to remember them in our prayers especially, that are vnder the tryall, and suffer imprisonment, or in any kinde for the truth of the Gospel. We are to pray to the Lord, that hee would vouchsafe to them such wisdome, Christian carriage, and boldnesse, meekenes, patience, constancie, and euery need∣full grace, and such a measure of needfull grace, as they may be able both to speake, doe, and suffer, in such sort as God may be gloryfied,How we are to practise this duty. the truth of the Gospel maintain∣ed without impeachment, and their owne soules comfort∣ed: and on the former ground, such as are in trouble must learne not to be secure,Men that are in trouble must not be secure, but must be earn∣est with God themselues & intreate others also to pray for them that they may bee strengthned. in time of tryall vpon confidence of their owne gifts. Admit a mans gifts were not inferiour to the holy Apostle Paul; yet such a man being in trouble for the Gospels sake, ought in feare and humillity to call on God for strength, and to intreate others likewise, to do the same, in his behalfe: but let it suffice to haue poynted at these things offered to vs from the circumstance of the person of the Apostle, his & condition at that time being a prisoner. Now touching the matter of this verse, we are in the next
place to marke, that the Apostle doth heere desire to bee helped by the prayers of the Colossians, that they would pray for him in particular, that he might vtter foorth and make manifest the mystery of Christ. He heere changeth the terme, in the verse before hee vsed the word (speake) but heere he saith, that I may vtter it, that I may manifest and make plaine. Whence wee are giuen to vnderstand thu much. That the speaking of the mystery of Christ, the preach∣ing  of the Gospell, ought to bee a manifestation of the se∣crets of it, the Minister in preaching of the Gospell, must manifest & make plaine the doctrin of it, and there ought to be a perspicuity and plaines in the ministrie of the word,There ought to be a perspi∣cuity and plainensse in the preachin of the word. yea, the word ought to be deliuered in such euidence and plainenesse, as the meanest capacitie may bee able to con∣ceiue and to vnderstand it, and as if Iesus Christ crucified, were pictured and painted out before the eies of men, as the Apostle sayd by way of reproofe to the Galathians, Gal. 3.1. O foolish Galathians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, to whom Iesus Christ before was described in your sight, and among you cru∣cified, as if hee had sayd, to whom haue I preached the doctrin of the Gospell in such euidence and plainnesse, as if Christ had beene painted out before your eyes, and had beene crucified among you, and you had seene his bloud distilling from his hands and side. And hence it is: That our Apostle calle his preaching of the Gospell, a declaration, or a manifestation of the trueth, for so the word signifieth, 2 Cor. 4.2. in declaration of the truth, we approoue our selues to euery mans conscience in the ight of God. The reason of this truth is plaine, namely this. The end of the preaching of the Gospell is to bring men to knowledge and faith in Christ, that they may come to know Christ and him crucified, and may beleeue
in him to their comfort and saluation. Now this cannot be effected, this end cannot be attained vnlesse men rightly conceiue and vnderstand the doctrin of Christ, therefore it must be deliuered in such euidence and plainenesse as they may conceiue and vnderstand it. That manner of preaching therefore cannot bee iusti∣fied, that is full of obscuritie,  wherein the doctrine is wrap∣ped vp in such words and sentences, as are aboue the reach and vnderstanding of the hearers,Preaching that is full of obscuity, and aboue the vn∣derstanding o the hearers cannot bee iu∣iustified. wherein there is a mix∣ture of speech, and intermingling of Latine and Greeke with Engish, before hearers that are vnlearned, and how∣soeuer some in way of defence of it, say, that kind of prea∣ching is learned, indeed and truth, there is no such matter, only that teacher shewes learning, that shewes men Christ, he is the learned preacher that is able rightly to vnfolde the mysterie of Christ, and to manifest the secrets of the Gospell, and so to paint out Christ before the people, as they may (as it were) see him crucified and glorified, and that life that flowes out of his bloud, and the comforts that are treasured vp in him; And againe must the doctrine of the Gospell bee deli∣uered  in such plaine termes, as men of the meanest capaci∣ty may be able to vnderstand: oh then take heed thou ex∣cept not against the doctrine of the word for the plaine∣nesse of deliuerie, if the doctrine bee sound and true, it is but a cauill of the flesh, and no iust excption to say, it is deliuered in plaine, easie and familiar termes,We must not except against the doctrin of the word be∣cause it is deli∣uered in plain, easie and fa∣miliar termes. and yet ma∣nie there be in the world that haue no great liking of the truth of the doctrine deluered, euen because it is tende∣red vnto them, in a familiar plainenesse and simplicitie; they haue itchng eares. 2. Tim. 4 3. they delight to heare things deliuered in more loftie and glorious termes, sure∣ly such persons shew the vanitie and weakenesse of their vnderstanding, and the vnsoundnes of their iudgements. Why shouldest thou except against or dislike the trueth deliuered in plaine and easie termes? art thou offended
with the Lord, for dealing plainely with thee? whence comes that exception and dislike? consider thou whence it comes, and thou shall finde it comes from thine owne corruption, helped forward by strong delusion of the ene∣my of thy saluation, for thou exceptest against that which may bee most for thy good, and likest that which many times turnes to thy hurt, the Lord (iustly punishing the va∣nity of thy mind, & the pride of thine hart) suffers thee to sucke in poison and dangerous errours, lying hid vnder lofty and goodly words, which thou vnderstandest not, & therefore take thou heed of excepting against the doctrin deliuered in plainnesse of words, if thou heare the truth of the word plainly deliuerd, be so far from excepting against it, as euen therfore blesse God for his mercy, that vouch∣safes to discouer to thee the truth of his word so familiarly remembring that speech of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14.22. strange tongs are for a signe, euen a iudegement and pu∣nishment sent of God to them that beleeue not, therefore take heed thou neither except against, nor dislike of the doctrine of the word, for the plainenesse of it, the plainer and the more familiarly the word is deliuered to thee in the publike ministry, the greater token and signe is it of Gods louing kindnesse and fauour towards thee, and yet know we, that this perspicuity and plainnesse in preach∣ing  of the word, must not be rude, rusticke and vnseemly, and therefore the Apostle addes in this verse,The Minister of the word must lay open the doctrine of the word, in such man∣ner as is suta∣ble both to the excellency of the matter, and to the dignity also of his wne cal∣ling. as it becom∣meth mee to speake. And so the next poynt of doctrine laid downe in this verse is this. The Ministers care and study must be, not only in plain & familiar termes to declare & speak the Gospell of Iesus Christ, but also so to speake it, as it ought to be declared; the Minister must not only haue care to manifest, and to lay open the doctrine of the word, but he must looke also that he do it in such manner as is meet, both according to the excellency of the matter, & dignity of his own calling, & that trust that is reposed in him, 1. Pet. 4.11. if any man
speak (saith the Apostle) that is, in the publike Ministrie of the word, let him speak, not only the words of God, but as the wordes of God, as it becomes him to speake, such words, we finde that the Minister of the Gospell is graced with many excellent titles, hee is called the messenger and ambassador of Christ, he is stiled with the name of Angel, Reuel. 2. & Cap. 3. Hee is said to bee the Lords Steward put in trust by him, 1. Cor. 4.1. all which teach him that he must deliuer the message of his Lord and Master, with due regard of the dignity of his message, and answerable to that trust that is reposed in him.2. particulars required in the right hand¦ling of the word of God. Not to stand on the generall: the particulars of this duty, are many, but especially these two. First, the Minister must looke, that he vtter foorth and declare the doctine of the word purely, and powerfully;  for the word of God is pure, and must be purely thought on, and purely deliuered, without mixture of mens deui∣ses, or mens authorities. Secondly, it must also be deliuered as the Apostle saith,  1. Cor. 2.4. In plaine euidence and demonstration of the Spirit, (that is) in such sort as sinne may thereby be rebu∣ked, the conscience rifled, and iudged, and the secret cor∣ruption of the heart made manifest, and that it may bee a meanes) by Gods blessing vpon it) to instill the grace of faith, and repentance, and holy obedience into the hearts of the hearers, yea the word must bee deliuered with such euidence of the spirit, as the hearers may discerne the po∣wer, the presence, and the maiesty of God in the preaching of it, and be forced to say in plain termes without question God is in the Preacher, 1 Cor. 14 25. that is the right maner of handling the word of God, when the preachers of it shew not words but power, as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 4.20. Now this doctrine might be applied to reproue sundry sorts of teachers,Sundrie sorts of teachers, briefly taxed. as (namely) such as deliuer the word of God in the intising words of mans wisdome, spirituall things in a carnal manner. Secondly, such as mingle the word with their own, and
other mens deuises, to make their doctrine haue the more applause, then which, what can bee more vnworthy? as the Lord saith by his Prophet Ier. 23.28. What is chaffe to the wheate? Thirdly, such as for want of paines, or study, deliuer the word, either in termes vnfit to teach, or perswade, or without order, and so not easie to bee learned, and re∣membred, and so wihout power, as it hath no point to pearce the hearts of the hearers, these, and many other, come within the compasse of iust reproofe by the doctine deliuered. But let vs thinke on it to this purpose; Is it so that the Minister must not only manifest the doctrine of the word, but he must deliuer it purely, and powerfully; yea, with such euidence and demonstration of the Spirit, as the word spoken by him may iudge the conscience, and search the secret corners of the heart; and as the Holy Ghost saith, Heb. 4.12. Enter thorow, euen the deuiding asunder of the soule and the spirit, and of the ioints and the marrow, and discouer the thoughts of the heart, and be a meanes to worke grace in the hearers? Oh then, as the Apostle saith, 2. Cor. 2.16. Who is suf∣ficient for these things?It is a very hard matter to preach the word of God aright. It is no easie matter to preach the word; Men thinke the Ministers of the worde of God speake whatsoeuer comes into their mindes; it is not so, if they speake the word as it ought to be spoken, no, no, Preaching of the word of God requires great labour, stu∣die, meditation, and praier, and the Minister must not onely bee earnest in praier himselfe, but after the example of the Apostle in this place, he must request others to pray for him, that he may vtter the Doctrine of the Gospell as it becommeth him to vtter it; did Paul who was guided by the Spirit of God, and had the infallible assistance of the Spirit (being an Apostle) desire to be praied for, that hee might vtter the doctrine of the Gospell as it became him to speake?
How geat cause then haue wee that are but ordinarie Ministers to desire the praiers of the Church, we are much more to craue the praiers of Gods people, and they are to helpe vs with their praiers; One saith well, consider that it is the easiest thing to heare, and it is the painefullest thing to preach the Gospel▪ aright; therefore pray thou that the Minister may vtter the doctrine of the word, as it becommeth him to speake, that he may deliuer it in such euidence, and plainenesse, and with al such purity and powerfulnesse, as it ought to bee deliuered, and then doubtlesse, through Gods blessing vpon it, thou shalt find it a meanes discouering the secret corruption of thine heart, and working sauing knowledge in thee. Yea, thou shalt find the doctrine of the word so deliuered, or meanes confirming and strengthning grace in thee, and making thee certaine of Gods grace in Christ; yea, making thee reioice in Gods presence in this life, and at the day of iudge¦ment to stand before him with ioy, therefore be minde∣full of this duty. VER. 5. Walke wisely toward them that are without, and redeeme the time. The Apostle in this verse proceedes to his second ge∣nerall exhortation, wherein hee exhorts the Colossians to carry themselues wisely toward them that are without, and this he doth generally in this verse, that they carry themselues wisely in all things, and then that they carrie themselues wisely in one particular, (namely) in the wise vsage of their speech, verse 6. His generall exhortation in this verse is first propoun∣ded. Walke wisely towards them that are with∣out. And then, more particularly declared, how they may
so doe in the last words (namely) By redeeming the time. (And redeeme the time.) First therefore of the generall exhortation, (Walke wisely toward them that are without.) Interpre∣tation.(Walke) That is, liue, carry your selues in life and con∣uersation, both in your words and deeds; the word (Walke) is often so vsed in the Scripture. (Wisely) or as the word is (in wisdome, or with wisedome) the meaning is, with good discretion, with religious heede, and circumspecti∣on, as the Apostle saith, Ephes. 5.15. Take heede that yee walke cicumspectly, not as fooles, but as wise. Christian dis∣cretion, what it is.Now Christian discretion, and an holy warinesse is vsed in life and conuersation, when in euery thing, said, or done, there is regard had of the end of the speach, or action, that the word or deed, be to the glory of God, and the good of others, and that it be without giuing aduan∣tage of iust exception against it, or any iust cause of of∣fence; that is (indeede) true Christian wisdome in life and conuersation: (toward them) that is, among them, or hauing any dealing with them (that are without) by those that are without, we are to vnderstand all vnbeleeuers, all that are out of the Church, or without Christ, as Ephes. 2.12. Whether such as haue not heard of Christ, as Infidels and Pagans, or such as haue heard the doctrine of the Gospell, and yet haue not receiued it, but still continue in their naturall hardnesse, and vnbeleefe. Thus then are we to conceiue these words, Walke wisely toward them that are without. As if the Apostle had said. Carrie your selues in life and conuersation, both in your words, and deedes, with Christian wis∣wisdome and discretion, with an holy warinesse, and circumspection, looke that in euery thing, said, or done by you, there bee regard had of a right ende, euen Gods glory, and the good of
others, and let your behauiour bee without iust cause of exception, or offence to them that are vnbeleeuers, of what sort soeuer they be, you li∣uing among them, as necessitie requires, or ha∣uing businsses and dealings with them. The dutie heere laid before vs, comes to bee conside∣red in the first place. And it may thus be conceiued. That true beleeuers, such as truely professe the Gospell,  are to carry themselues wisely, with good discretion,True belee∣uers must bee wise in their behauiour & dealings with the wicked & vnbeleeuers, and take heed that they giue them no iust cause of excep¦tion or of∣fence. with warinesse, and circumspection, euen toward them that are without, in their walking among the wicked, and vn∣beleeuers, and in their dealings with them, they must haue a wise regard of their behauiour, they must looke that e∣uery thing, said, or done by them, be to Gods glory, and (if it be possible) a meanes to worke good vpon the wic∣ked, and that it be without iust cause of exception, and of∣fence, I say, without iust cause of exception, and offence; for many times the wicked take exception against the ho∣lie religious and godly behauiour of true beleeuers, and are offended at it, 1 Pet. 4.4. And as the Prophet saith, Hosea 14.10. The wicked stumble, and fall in the waies of God; but that is offence taken, not giuen. True be∣leeuers, and professors of the Gospell must be wise in their behauiour, and take heede they giue not any iust cause of exception, or offence, and that not onely to their weake brethren, but euen to the wicked and vnbeleeuing. And hence it is, that the Apostle doth exhort vs, Rom. 12.17. To procure things honest in the sight of all men (that is) wordes and deeds, not onely lawfull, and agreeable to the rule of honesty, and goodnes, & the will of God reuealed in his word, but such also as giue no iust offence to any, as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 10.32. Giue none offence, neither to the Iewes, nor to the Grecians, nor to the Church of God: neither to the Church, nor to those that
are without the Church, 1. Thess. 4.11.12. the Apostle ex∣horted them of that Church, that they should study to be quiet, and to meddle with their owne businesse, and to worke with their owne hands; to this ende, that they might behaue themselues honestly, (or as the word signi∣fieth) decently towards them that are without, euen in the sight of vnbeleeuers. Wee see then there ought to be a Christian wisdome, a godly warinesse, and circumspection in such as are true beleeuers, that in their behauiour among the wicked, they giue them no iust aduantage, either to except against, or to be offended with any thing, said, or done by them. And the reason of this duty is this. The life and behauiour of true beleeuers, ought to bee a visible confutation of the manners of the wicked, that when they looke vpon it, they may bee checked and re∣proued, thereby made to see how they ought to behaue themselues, and may glorifie God in the day of the visita∣tion, 1. Pet. 2.12. And therefore it ought to be far from be∣ing like to the wicked life of vnbeleeuers, in any respect, that so it may giue them no iust cause of exception, and of stumbling at it. Now then, to applie this, I may say to many professors in this case,Many profes∣sors of the Gospell iustly taxed for be∣hauing them∣selues vnwise∣lie in the sight of the wicked and prophane as the Apostle said to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6.7. There is vtterly a fault among you. There is in many professors of the Gospel too great a yeelding to their own corrupt affections, some that make profession of the Gos∣pell, carrie themselues not as wise, but as fooles, in the sight of the wicked, and vngodly, and as Michal said to Dauid 2 Sam. 6.20. they vncouer themselues in the eies of carnall minded men, as a foole vncouers himselfe, they shew themselues enuious, couetous, selfe-conceited, con∣tentious one with another, censorious and such like, e∣uen in the sight of the wicked, that they are able iustlie to taxe them with these and the like faults. Oh remember thou hast taken on thee the profession
of the Gospell, and wouldest beare the name of a true Christian, thou must walke wisely euen towards them that are without; in thy whole carriage in thy words and deedes, thou must haue regard to the right ende, Gods glory, and the good of others, and thou must take heede thou giue no iust cause of exception or offence, by any thing thou saiest, or doest, no not to the wicked, and vn∣beleeuing; yea, thou must be so wise in thy carriage, and thy behauiour among them,Note. as that sometimes thou must forbeare the doing of some lawfull thing so farre as may stand with the keeping of faith and a good conscience; if so be, thou in thy Christian wisdome and discretion per∣ceiue, that the doing of it will hinder some great good that may otherwise be done. We haue example of this in Paul, Acts 19.10. Hee was full two yeeres in Ephesus an Idolatrous Citie, and saw their Idolatrous worship of Diana, yet all that while hee kept silence, and spake not a word in particular against Di∣ana, as he might haue done, onely in generall termes hee said, as it is in the speach of Demetrius verse 26. That they were no gods which were made with hands. And this did Paul forbeare to doe, that hee might doe some good in that Citie by preaching of the Gospell, which could not haue beene suffered if he had spoken against Diana in particular. And thus must thou that art a true professour of the Gospell doe sometimes, and let it neuer bee iustly said of thee, that wouldest carrie the name of a true Christian,3. Things are to be conside∣red, seruing, to stirre vp true professors of the Gospell to carrie them∣selues wisely in the sight of the wicked. that thou art as couetous, as vnquiet, once angrie, as hard to be appeased, as mercilesse, as ready to catch, as idle, as censorious, and iudgeing, as those that make no professi∣on at all, let none of these things, or the like, bee truely affirmed of thee, let not the wicked bee able iustly to charge them vpon thee. And to that end consider. First, that if thou carrie thy selfe so vnwisely, and so
with∣out Christian discretion, as thou giuest iust cause of ex∣ception, or offence, thou dost expose thy selfe to the ma∣lice of the wicked, and (as it were) inclose thy selfe with∣in their hands, and if the wicked bee so bold, as that they will assault the names of the harmelesse, with obtrectati∣ons, and slanders, how will they insult ouer thee, hauing iust aduantage against thee? Againe, consider that by thy euill and vnwise behaui∣our in the sight of the wicked, thou dost not onely expose thy selfe to contempt, but euen the Gospell it selfe, which thou dost professe, to scorne and reproach; and through thy vnwise behauiour the name of God is blasphemed, and these among the wicked, of whom there remained any hope, are cast further of, and left without all hope to be recouered. Thus speakes the Lord by his Prophet Eze∣kiel 36.20. and the Apostle cites it, Rom. 2.24. And remember further, that thou bearing the name of a true Christian, by thy godly, wise, and warie conuersa∣tion among the wicked, God is glorified, 1 Pet. 2.12. the doctrine of God our Sauiour is adorned, Tit. 2.10. and many times vnbeleeuers are wrought vpon, and wonne as the Apostle saith in one particular; Let wiues bee sub∣iect to their husbands, that euen they which obey not the word, may bee wonne by the conuersation of the wiues. Oh then, thou that dost, or wouldest carry the name of a true Christian, bee thou carefull to walke wisely toward them that are without, let thy words and deeds be ordered by Christian wisdome, in all thy speaches, and actious, haue an eie to Gods glory, and the good of others, and take thou diligent heed, that nothing be said, or done by thee, that may giue iust aduantage to the wicked to speak euill of thee, and to throw disgrace vpon thy holy pro∣fession. In the next place, wee are to marke, that the Apostle saith not, Walke wisely with them, but toward them that are without; it is one thing to walke with vnbeleeuers, and
another to walke toward them, there is great difference betweene these two: to walke with anie, is to walke as they do,Note. & to hold on the same kind & course of life that they doe, but to walke toward others, is to liue among them, and as occasion is offered, to haue businesse and dealing with them. Hence then we may gather thus much. That howsoeuer we are not to walke with the wicked,  wee are not to doe as they doe, nor to follow their trade and manner of life, yet wee may liue among them, and haue businesse, trading and dealing with them, as occasi∣on is offered, howsoeuer, wee are to eschew the corrupti∣ons and bad manners of the wicked, yet wee are not alto∣gether to auoyd all manner of dealing with them,Though we are to eschew the corrupti∣ons and bad manners of the wicked, yet we are not to auoyd all mnner of dealng with them. the A∣postle hath taught vs, Phillip. 2.15. that wee are to liue blamelesse and pure, and the sonnes of God without re∣buke, but where? apart from all wicked and vngodly men? no, in the midst of a naughty and crooked nation, among whom we ought to shine as lights, and that in the world, euen in the throng of wicked men, and vnbeleeuers. The Lord will haue his children to liue among the wicked, as Lot did in Sodome. Reasons why the Lord will haue his chil∣dren liue a∣mong the wicked. First that they may spend their time, their strength, and all their abilities of body and mind, for the common good of all, as the Apostle saith, 1. Pet. 4.10. let euery man as he hath receiued the gift, minister the same to another, as good disposers, of the manifold grace of God. Secondly, for the exercise of their faith, their wisdome, and other graces that are in them, and for the triall of their strength in striuing against sinne, that their faith and o∣ther graces may bee exercised, and that they may bee tried what is in them, whether they will cleaue to the Lord with a perfect heart, or bee carried aside with the corruption of the worlde, for that is indeede true re∣sistance of sinne, and victorie ouer it most victorious, when wee conflicting and grappling with manie occa∣sions
and allurements to it, striue against it, and ouercome it, and he is truelie good, who is good among such as bee euill, if Ioseph had not beene tempted to folly by his Mi∣stresse, his chastity had not beene so great and glorious. The Lord therefore will haue vs liue in the world, a∣mong the wicked of the world, in the middest of manie meanes and prouocations to euill, that the strength of Gods grace that is in vs, may bee knowen, and this do∣ctrine might bee applied to shew the error of some of an∣cient time,  and of some of our time, who refuse to liue in any fellowshippe with notorious sinnefull men,Some briefly taxed, who refuse to liue in anie fellow∣ship with no∣torious sinne∣full men. and I might heereby shew the errour of the Monkes and Vota∣ries among the Papists, who thinke it a state of perfection to liue like droanes fatting themselues in a cloyster, apart from all societie of men, but I rather chuse to shew the li∣mitation of this truth that it bee not misconceiued of vs, and touching the limits of it, know wee that it is thus confined. We may liue among the wicked, only as we stand in some relation with them,The Godly may liue a∣mong the wicked only as they stand in some relati∣on with them & as we are conioyned with them by some bond of nature, of office, of place or habitation, for the corruption of men must not driue vs from our stati∣on and from performance of Christian duties that con∣cerne vs in our places and callings, as the Lord hath cal∣led euerie one,Note. so let him walke, 1. Cor. 7.17. And againe, wee may haue dealing with the wicked, onely as iust occasion is offered,The Godly may haue dea∣lings with the wicked onely as iust occasi∣on is offered. we may not hand ouer head, liue with all sort of wicked persons, and carelesly thrust our selues into anie wicked companie, and thinke as the foolish Familists doe, or as Drunkards and Epi∣cures doe, that it is no matter into what companie wee come, we haue no warrant for that: And there is great danger in so doing, there is no disease so contagious, nor sickenesse so infectious, as is the ill behauior of the wic∣ked, if we sort our selues with them, and there is no age, sexe or complexion, so apt to catch and take a disease
from another, as are the best of Gods children, to take hurt by the companie of wicked persons, and therefore wee are not to liue among them, but according to the limite of our owne particular places and callings, nor to haue dealings with them, but as iust occasion shall be offe∣red vnto vs. In the last place it is not to be omitted, that those who haue not heard, or not receiued the Gospell, are heere said to be without, wherein the Church is compared to Gods Kingdome, Citie or House, true beleeuers to the subiects, citizens and houshold of God, and vnbeleeuers to stran∣gers, and such as haue no part nor portion amonge them. Here then appeares the wretched and cursed condition  of wicked men and vnbeleeuers,Wicked men and vnbelee∣uers are in a most misera∣ble state and condition. they are disioyned from God, the fountaine of all true happinesse and comfort, they haue no fellowship with God, or the people of God, Ephes. 2.12. they are without Christ, and are aliants from the common-wealth of Israel, and strangers from the co∣uenants of promise, and haue no hope, and are without God in the world. Yea wicked persons such as beleeue not so long as they continue in that state stand subiect to the whole wrath of God,  oh that they had hearts to consider their fearefull condition,Wicked per∣sons are to consider their fearefull con∣dition, and to hasten out of it as soone as possibly they may. thou that art a drunkard, a swea∣rer, a prophane person, consider thy cursed state, as yet thou art seuered from Gods comfortable presence, thou art shut out from all benefit of Gods promises of life and saluation, thou hast no part nor title to the blessings of God, belonging to the Saints of God, and that is a begin∣ning of hellish torment, for finall separation from God, and an apprehension of his wrath is hell it selfe. Now such is the case of all men, that doe not yet truely beleeue in Christ, and such are they that liue in the pra∣ctise of any knowen sinne, yea thinke on it, thou that art a wicked man, and an vnbeleeuer, thou art so farre disioy∣ned from God by thy sinne, as there is greater enmitie,
and contrarietie betweene God and thee, then betweene fire and water, light and darkenesse, and if God be against thee, then who can stand for thee? nay God being thine enemie, all the iudgements of God attend thee, all the creatures of God are armed against thee, and thou liest o∣pen to eternall woe and miserie: Oh then enter into a se∣serious consideration of thy miserable state and conditi∣on, and pray to the Lord, that by the light of his worde, and power of his spirit, thine eies may be open to see that miserie, and seeing it maist be humbled for it, and hasten out of it, and neuer rest till thou be sure thou doest truely beleeue in Iesus Christ, and then without question thou shalt be in Gods fauour, and be one of his owne house and family,The happie condition of such as truely beleeue in Ie∣sus Christ. and haue communion and fellowship with God, and with the Saints of God, and that is a most blessed state and condition, thou shalt then haue peace with God, with thine owne conscience, with all the faithfull, yea with all the creatures in the world. The stones of the field shall be in league with thee, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee, Iob. 5.23. thou shalt haue accesse to the throne of grace with boldnes, and come into Gods house with ioy & gladnes, thou shalt haue title to all the blessings of Gods Saints in this life, and right to eternall happinesse in the life to come. Labour therefore for this aboue all things, and count all things losse in respect of this, that thou maist winne Christ, and be found in him and by him bee conioyned with God, and the Church of God, and bee partaker of all the comforts and blessings that belong to Gods Saints. Now to the last words of this verse. (And redeeme the time) the Apostle hauing required of the Colossians by way of exhortation, generallie; that they should walke wisely toward those that are without, in these wordes (redeeme the time) he shewes how they may so do, & wherin especially standeth their godly, wise,
discreete and wary walking towards them that are with∣out namely in or by redeeming the time, for these words (redeeme the time) are not (as they may seeme) a distinct precept, or an exhortation by it selfe, but are to bee con∣ceiued as expressing the manner of wise walking toward them that are without, the originall text shewes it plainly, for thus runne the words, walke wiselie toward them that are without redeeming the time. The word heere translated (time) properly signifieth opportunitie or present occasion, that present fit time,Interpre∣tation. wherein anie thing to bee done, may bee done fitly and happily, and it is heere to bee vnderstood with relation to the good that may bee done, euen for that fit opportuni∣ty, and fit occasion offered of well doing, and the word (redeeme) in the proper and naturall signification of it, signifies to buy some thing backe againe, and it is heere vsed metaphorically by way of similitude, it is taken from the custome and practise of wise Marchants, or Trades∣men, who vse to buy their commodities while fit time of buying serues, and while the market holds, and hauing (happily) had great losses, or formerly spent their time idlely or vnthriftily, doe afterwards seeke to redeeme, and (as it were) to buy backe againe the time that is past, not that they are able to call backe againe any one mi∣nute of time past, that is impossible, but by their most carefull and diligent imploying of the present fit time of gaining, that is offered to them, by vsing in that opportunitie more then ordinarie diligence, for recoue∣uering of their losses, euen then breaking of their sleepe, and abridging themselues of lawfull refreshing and delights, they doe as much businesse in that same time, as they might haue done both in that, and in the time formerly mispent, if they vsed onely or∣dinarie diligence; and so to redeeme that opportunitie and fitte occasion offered of dooing good, and of well doing.
Signifieth two things. First, to obserue, take, and vse it being offered, and not to let it slip, and passe away without vsing of it. And secondly, to vse it with more then ordinary dili∣gence, yea, to vse it with losse of our owne pleasures and profits. Thus then wee are to conceiue these words, as if the A∣postle had said to the Colossians. Obserue, take and vse the opportunity, and fit occasion of well doing, when it is offered, yea, vse it with more then ordinarie diligence, euen with losse of your owne pleasures profits. Now heere first in that the Apostle saith, walke wisely to them that are without subioyning (as shewing the man∣ner how they may so doe) (redeeme the time) or (redee∣ming the time) I might hence note thus much. That we shew our selues wise Christians, such as carry our selues wisely among them that are without, if so be we omit no opportunitie of well doing, but on that I will not stand, but rather on a positiue point, the dutie hence offered, namely this. That the time and oportunitie of doing good, both in respect of our selues and others,The time and oportunity of doing good both in re∣spect of our selues and o∣thers, is to bee taken and v∣sed when it is offered. is not to be neglected, and let passe, when it is offered, we are to obserue the time and oportunitie of doing good, and to take it, and vse it, when it is offred vnto vs, when we haue oportunity for the pra∣ctise of the duties of piety, or for the doing of any good, we may not foreslow it, and let it slip awaie from vs, and this hath our Sauiour taught vs plainely, Ioh. 12.35. where he saith, yet a little while is the light with you, walk while ye haue light, least the darkenesse come vpon you, for he that walketh in the darke knoweth not whether he goeth, as if hee had sayd, you haue now oportunity, and fit time to walke as ye ought, hauing light to direct you, look that you vse it, while you haue it, and let it not passe away from you, least that being gone, and darkenesse
comming on you, you know not then whither ye go, Gal. 6.10. saith the Apostle, while wee haue time let vs doe good vnto all men. Let vs not suffer any good occasion of doing good to others, slippe away from vs, but let vs take holde of it, while it is offered, and so in one particular the holy Ghost bids vs, Heb. 3.13. exhort one another while it is called to day, and to these I might adde many other testimonies, for the proofe of this point, Ierem. 8.7. the Lord com∣plained of his people, that they did not obserue and vse the time of grace and mercy, for the amendment of their liues when it was offered vnto them yea, in that re∣spect he preferres the verie bruit beasts before them (saith he) euen the Storke in the aire knoweth her appoynted times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow, obserue the time of their comming, but my people know∣eth not the iudgement of the Lord, they obserue not, nei∣ther vse the time of grace and mercy for the amendment of their liues so that wee see by plaine euidence of Scrip∣ture, that we are not to neglect and let passe the opportu∣nitie offered vnto vs, for the exercise of pietie, or for the doing of any good whatsoeuer, the reason and ground of this is. Because indeede,  as the Lord in his eternall counsell hath ordained things to bee done, so hath hee appoynted the oportunity and time wherein each thing should bee done; wee are therefore to obserue, and to take, and vse that time and that opportunity of doing good, either in respect of our selues or others, which the Lord doth vouchsafe and offer to vs, and that wee may rightly con∣ceiue this point, and draw it to some profitable vse. We must learne and marke a difference of good things that are to bee done by vs,A difference of good things that are to bee done by vs is to be obserued some are such good things as reach not to all times of this life, such as are not to bee done at all times, but are limited to some particular time and are to bee done in some particular time and season
as hearing and reading the word of GOD, and reading other good bookes, conference, set and solemne prayer, giueinge good councell, admonition, reproofe, giuinge almes and the like. Though these be good thinges, that we are to doe, yet the doing of them, is not bound to all times, and so the oportuniie of doing these thinges, and the like: only then when the Lord doth vouchsafe vs meanes, and abilli∣tie, and just occasion in respect of time, place, person, and other circumstances. Other good thing there be that we are bound to doe, which extend and reach ouer the whole life, and are to be continuall acts, to be performed in euery part, and time of our liues. From the doing of which, no part of our life is exempted: as (namely) the excercise of faith, and repentance, of amendment of our liues, of workinge out our owne saluation, with feare and trem∣blinge, of seekeinge reconciliation, with GOD, yea though wee haue assurance of saluation. And the oportunitie of doing these and the like things, is euery instant and present time, euen euerie moment of our liues, is the oportunitie giuen vs for the amendment and reformation of our liues, yet more speciall oportu∣nitie vouchsafed vnto vs, for the doinge of these thinges: For our turning to God, for our seekinge reconciliation with God, and the like: is that time of the Lords gracious visitation, as our Sauiour calls it. Luke 19.44 That ac∣ceptable time, and that day of saluation, as the Apostle calls it. 2. Cor. 6.2. (that is) that time wherein the Lord doth offer vs mercie in the ministrie of his word, wherein he stands at the dore of our hearts, & knocks by the sound of his word outwardly, and by the motions of his spirit in∣wardly, shewing vs our sinnes, and moouinge vs to repen∣tance, yea that time wherein the Lord calls vs to repen∣tance by his mercies, by his judgements, by his patience, and longe sufferance: thus then wee are to conceiue the doctrine now laid before vs.
Wee are to obserue the oportunity and fit time of doing good and to take that oportunitie when it is offe∣red vnto vs, (that is) we are to obserue and marke when the Lord doth vouchsafe vs meanes to doe good, and iust occasion in regard of time, place, person, &c. for the do∣ing of any good thing that is limited to some particular time, and to take that opportunity when it is offered, and to vse it, and not to let it slip, and wee are to obserue euery part and time of our life, as fit for repentance, and amende∣ment of our liues; but especially, the time of the Lords gracious visitation of vs, by the Ministie of the word, and when the Lord calles vs to repentance by mercies, or by iudgements, and to take hold of that opportunitie, and to vse it, and not to suffer it to passe away from vs. And now to come a little nearer to our selues,  I may say to vs, as the Apostle did in that, 2 Cor. 6.2.We are to ob∣serue the Lords graci∣ous visitation of vs by the mnistrie and preaching of the Gospell and to make vse of it for our good while it is of∣fered. Behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of saluation: the Lord hath a long time, and doth still vouchsafe to vi∣sit vs with his word and Gospell, and hath seconded the same both with his mercies, and his iudgments. This then is that opportunitie, this is that fit time of repentance, and of turning from our sinnes to God, in amendment of our liues, and of doing good to our selues. Let vs take notice of it, and obserue it, yea, let euery one of vs in particular obserue it; doe thou obserue, and take hold of this opor∣tunity of the good of thy soule while it is offered, thou knowest not how soone it may be taken from thee.2 Motues to stirre vs vp to obserue the time of the Lords graci∣ous visitation of vs by the prechig of his Gospell, and to make vse of it while we haue it. First, if Christ now knocke at the doore of thine heart, by the preaching of the Gospell, and by his mercies and iudgements, and thou deferre to open vnto him, and to let him in, and let slip the opportunitie of turning from thy sinnes to God, in amendement of thy life; happily heereafter thou maiest pine away with a desire of hauing him, and yet not finde him, nor any place to repentance; remember that exhortation of the Prophet, Isai. 55 6 Seeke yee the Lord while hee may bee found, and call yee vpon
him while he is neare. There will come a time wherein the Lord will not be found; yea, a time will come which hee threatneth, Prouerb. 1.26. When such as now regard not, but despise his calling vnto them, shall crie to him in their miserie, and hee will not heare them, but laugh at their destruction: which is a fearefull sentence, as one saith, the Lords laughter is more to bee feared then his anger; therefore take heede, thou let not slip that opportunity of doing good to thine owne soule that is yet offered vnto thee. Againe, consider the wisdome of men in matters of the world; the Seafaring man he obserues the winde, and the weather, and takes the opportunity of the time; the Traueller he takes the day before him and trauels whiles it light, the Smith he strikes the iron while it is hot, when it it is cold, it is to late to strike; yea euery man of yeeres and discretion, will consider the oportunitie offered for the well-doing of his businesse, and hee will condemne himselfe if he let it slip; and wilt thou then be more care∣lesse in Spirituall matters, and more absurdly foolish in things concerning thine owne euerlasting good? Oh con∣sider thou the opportunity that is offered to thee for the good of thy soule; obserue thou the fit time of well-do∣ing, which the Lord doth vouchsafe thee, and when the Lord doth vouchsafe thee the benefit of his word, and many mercies, both common to thee with others, and pe∣culiar to thy selfe, and he sends his iudgements to warne both thee and others: know thou, that that is thy opor∣tunitie of turning from thy sinnes, and amendement of thy life, obserue it, take hold of it, let it not slippe from thee, but vse it so, as it may bee for Gods glory, and the comfort of thine owne soule. From these words (redeeming the time) vnderstood as before they were expounded; we are further taught thus much. That in vsing the oportunity of well-doing, wee are to
be likewise Marchants or Tradesmen. A wise Marchant or Tradesman hauing heeretofore lost time of gai∣ning,In vsing the oportunity of wel doing we must bee like¦wise Mar∣chāts or trades¦men, we must gaine the time formerly lost by our negli∣gence, by dou¦ble diligence. he will (as it were) buie it backe againe, by his more then ordinarie diligence, when time serues him againe; so must wee doe in respect of the oportunitie and time of well-doing offered vnto vs, wee must gaine the time wee haue formerly lost by negligence, with double diligence; yea, we must redeeme it with losse of our ease, our plea∣sures, and our profits, 1 Pet. 4 3. It is sufficient (saith the Apostle) for vs that wee haue spent the time past of the life after the lust of the Gentiles, walking in wantonnesse, lusts, drunkennesse, in gluttonies, drinkings, and in abo∣minable idolatries. We are to consider our former mispent time, and not to mispend any more, but rather to gaine and recouer that which hath beene lost with future diligence in well-doing. Psalm, 119.32. Dauid saith, I will runne the way of thy Commandements, when thou shalt enlarge mine heart: where we see Dauid promiseth that his heart beeing set at liberty, being set free by grace from the bondage and do∣minion of his own natural corruption, he would not walke and keepe an ordinarie pace in the waies of Gods Com∣mandements, but he would runne in them, hee would make more then ordinarie speed in well-doing, and so re∣deeme the time formerly lost. Thus must euery one whose heart is set free from the bondage of sinne,  if thou per∣swade thy selfe, the Lord hath wrought in thee by his spi∣rit, and set thee free from the dominion and power of thy naturall corruption, thou must runne the waies of Gods Commandements, thou must gaine time of well-doing with double diligence; it must be farre from thee to spend thy time in trifles, and pastime, and after the manner of the world,It must be far from true be∣leeuers to spend their time in trifles, and after the manner of the world, they must vse more then ordinary diligence in doing good things. in vaine delights to driue away dumpes, though indeed lawfull recreation may bee vsed, if it bee vsed lawfully, and at times meet and conuenient, to make vs more fit for the good duties, yet thou must take heede
thy heart be not entangled with the pleasures of this life, remember thou, that time well passed, is the best pastime, and thou that art a true beleeuer,Note. and set free from the po∣wer of sinne, thou must vse more then ordinarie diligence in doing of good things, thou must not content thy selfe to heare the word, to pray or to doe other good things, as meere naturall men vse to doe them (that is) so as may stand with their credit in the world, with their ease and worldly profit; if hearing of a Sermon crosse their world∣lie commodity, they will none of that, thou must not so doe; no, no, thou must redeeme the oportunitie and time of doing good, thou must buy it with a price, euen with the losse of thine owne ease, pleasure, and pro∣fitte.2. Motiues to stirre vs vp to redeeme the time of doing good with the losse of our own ease, pleasures, and profits. And to helpe thee forward, and to stirre thee vp to the practise of this dutie: consider with me onely these two things. First, marke what the Apostle saith, Tit. 2.14. Christ gaue himselfe for vs, that hee might redeeme vs from all  iniquity, and purge vs to be a peculiar people vnto himself, zealous of good workes. Whence wee may gather, that if thou be not zealous of good workes, if thou bee not stu∣dious and carefull in doing good, if thou vse not more then ordinarie paines to doe well, and if thou redeeme not time in well-doing, thou canst haue no sound assurance, that thou art redeemed by Christ. Againe, consider thus much, thou must one day come to be accomptant for the spending of thy time, and if thou do not number thy daies, and redeeme the time, and spend the oportunity of well doing, with more then or∣dinarie diligence, thou wilt be farre from a good account, and the Lord will iudge thee as an vnthrifty seruant that hast not gained by thy talent: If then, thou wouldest haue sound and comfortable assurance, that thou art re∣deemed by Christ, and if thou wouldest be able to make a good account of the spending of thy time before the
Iudge of all the world, and haue it said to thee as it is, Mat. 25.21. Well done good and faithfull seruant, enter thou into thy Masters ioy, then looke thou redeeme the time of doing good, doe not thou onely obserue, take, and vse the opportunity of well-doing, but vse it with more then ordinary paines, and diligence, euen with losse of thine owne ease, pleasure, and profit, and if thou so gaine time, no doubt thou shalt then bee richly rewarded with gaine and glorie in the day wherein the Lord shall come to take account of his seruants. VER. 6. Let your speach bee gracious alwaies, and powdred with salt, that yee may know how to answer euery man. In this Verse our Apostle comes to exhort the Colos∣sians to carry themselues wisely toward them that are without, in one particular thing, (namely) in the wise v∣sage of their speach, because (indeede) in wise ordering of the speach; spirituall wisdome is singularly discouered, and withall, holy and gracious speach, is a vsuall and ve∣rie effectuall way and meanes of doing good vpon them that are without, and of winning them: therefore the A∣postle doth particularly exhort thereunto. The generall parts of this verse are two. First, a dutie touching the right ordering of speach, propounded by way of exhortation in these words, Let your speach be gracious. 1 Which exhortation is further enlarged by the extent of that duty, in respect of time, that their speach should be gracious alwaies. 2 And then, by a similitude, wherein gracious speach is compared to meat powdered and well seasoned, in these words, and powdered with salt,
The second part of the verse is a declaration of the end, wherefore the Colossians should looke that their speech were gracious (namely) this, that so they might know how to answere euery man, expressed in the last words, That yee may know how to answer euery man. Of these in order. First therefore, of the exhortation, Let your speach bee gracious alwaies, and poudered with salt. Interpre∣tation.In the originall the words runne thus, Let your speach be alwaies in grace powdred with salt, Which sentence stan∣ding vpon a comparison, is in generall thus to be concei∣ued; Let your speach be seasoned with grace as other things are with salt: wherein the Apostle compares gracious speach to flesh, or fish, or other things, that are powdered. Now (as we know) things that are powdred with salt, are not onely by that powdring kept from rottennesse, and putri∣faction, but they also taste of that seasoning, and are made more sauorie, and pleasing to the taste of those that eate them, they are made both wholesome, and sauourie, so would the Apostle haue speech and communication, not onely by grace to be kept from rottennesse, and corrupti∣on, that so it be not rotten speech, as hee speakes, Epes. 4.29. But that it also bee so seasoned with grace, as that it carrie with it the taste of grace, and euen expresse the grace that is within in the heart, and that it bee good and profitable to the hearers, and apt to engender and worke some grace in the hearts, and mindes of them that heare it, for (indeed) speach is, or may bee said to bee gracious or seasoned with grace, when it expresseth some grace, that is in the heart of the speaker, and when it is also apt to worke some grace in the hearts of those that heare it, as the Apostle saith, Ephesians 4.29. When it is good to the vse of edifying, and doth minister grace to the hea∣rers. Thus then we are to vnderstand this exhortation.
Let your speach, your talke, and communi∣cation one with another be so seasoned with grace, as other things are with salt, as that it be not only thereby kept from rottennesse, and corruption, but that it sauour of grace, and expresse that grace that is within in the heart, and that it be also fit to worke grace in those that heare it. Not to speake of that which is offered to vs from this verse, considered together with the former, the Apostle heere exhorting the Colossians to carrie themselues wise∣lie toward them that are without, particularly in regard of their speach, and so implying that holy and gracious speach serues much for the good of our selues, and others, we shall haue occasion to speake of that afterwards. In the first place, we haue in this exhortation this duty plainely laid before vs. That our speach must bee gracious, it must  bee seasoned with the salt of grace, it must sauour of grace, as powdred meates doe of salt,Our speach must be seaso∣ned with the salt of grace, and sauour of grace, as pow∣dred meats doe of salt. and it must be a manifesting, and an ex∣pressing of the grace that is within, wrought in our hearts. And hence it is that the Preacher saith, Eccles. 10.12. That the words of the mouth of a wise man haue grace: and Prou. 15.1. Salomon saith, the tongue of the wise vseth knowledge (that is) the wise person speakes in such sort, as that his speach doth shew foorth grace, and wee haue example of this in our Sauiour Christ, Luke 4.22. Where wee finde it said, that hee spake with an eui∣dence, and plaine demonstration of grace, that the people wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And the reason of this, that our speech must bee seaso∣ned with grace, and sauour of grace that is within, is plaine (namely) this▪
Because not onely the heart and the inward faculties of the soule must be sanctified, but the tongue also, and the outward parts of the body, grace and holinesse must not be onely within, but it must also spread and stretch it selfe to all the parts of the body: yea to all the actions and o∣perations of euery part and member of the body, else is there no true sanctification. Therefore the speach, which is the exercise of the tong, must be seasoned with grace, and must sauour of grace. Now that we may better conceiue this duty, wee must know that there be many particular graces, that are to bee sprinkled vpon our speeches, as salt vpon meat, and where∣with it must bee seasoned, and whereof it must taste, and sauour,5. Special gra∣ces wherwith our speech must be seaso∣ned & where∣of it must taste and sauour. but especially these fiue (namely) A reuerent regard both of God and men. Modestie. Meekenesse. Sinceritie. And a due regard of the good name of others. I will speake of them a little further in order briefly. First, our speach must be seasoned with a reuerent re∣gard of God,A reuerent re∣gard of God and men. if wee haue occasion to vse his names, and titles, as Lord, God, &c. or those things whereby hee is knowne to vs, as his attributes, his ordinances, his crea∣tures, his iudgements, &c. we are to vse them with all re∣uerence of his great name, and with feare of his glorious maiestie, Deut. 28.58. and contrarie to this, is light and carelesse vsing of any of his titles in our common talke and communication, customable swearing, and forswea∣ring, blaspheming, cursing, making iests of Scripture phrase, and the like. Againe, our speach must be seasoned with a reuerent re∣gard of men, in our speaking of men, and to men, we are to expresse a regard of that which is to bee reuerenced in them, as (namely) the image of God, and especially the renouation of his image, and if they bee aboue vs in age,
gifts, place, &c. then to speake of them, and to them, with iust titles of reuerence, as Anna did, who being rebuked by Elie, answered him with reuerence, and sayd, nay my Lorde, 1. Sam. 1.15. I might shewe this in other ex∣amples. Contrarie to this, is scoffing, cursing & deriding speech, and vnreuerent speaking of men, and to men. Secondly, our speech must be seasoned with modesty,Modesty. and that is thus, if wee bee to mention good things, that are in vs, or good things done by vs, tending to our com∣mendation, we are to speake of them with modestie, and so as wee rather extenuate them, then boast of them, as Paul did, 1. Cor. 15.9. I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to bee called an Apostle, if wee bee to mention things that may mooue blushing, wee are to vtter them in as seemely wordes as possibly may bee. Contrarie to this is boasting and vainglorious speaking of our selues forbidden, Prou. 27.2. let another man  praise thee, and not thine owne mouth,Meekenesse. and contrary to modesty in speaking, is also filthie, obscene and vn∣chaste speaking forbidden by the Apostle, chapter the 3. verse 8. but put away euen all these things, wrath, anger, maliciousnesse, cursed speaking, filthy speaking out of your mouth. Thirdly, our speech must be seasoned with meeknesse, we are to answer or reprooue those that anie way offend vs, with meekenesse, with calme and quiet speech, free from passion and perturbation, 1. Pet. 3.9. bee courteous (saith the Apostle) not rendering euill for euill, neither rebuke for rebuke. Contrary to this is miscalling, rating and reuiling one another. Fourthly, our speech must be seasoned with sinceritie,  wee are to speake the trueth sincerely,Sincerity. or at least that wee thinke to bee the trueth, and wee are to deale plainely,
and sincerely with others, in speaking of their sinnes, when iust occasion is offred, to tell them of their sins, E∣phes. 4.25. speake euerie man the truth vnto his neighbor Leuit. 19.17. thou shalt nor hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou shalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour, and suffer him not to sinne. Contrary to this, are lying, glosing, dissembling, and flattering speeches, speeches that sooth vppe men in their sinnes, or extell them aboue measure, whereof Dauid speakes Psal. 12.2. they speake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and speake with a double heart. Last of all, our speech must bee seasoned with care of o∣ther  mens good name,Care of other mens good name. wee are to speake of the sayings or doings of other men in priuate, charitably, either speaking of them, as little as may bee, if they bee euill, or inter∣presing all in the better part, if they bee doubtfull, and where there is no euident cause to the contrary, which is an especiall fruit of charity, as the Apostle shewes 1. Cor. 13.7. loue beleeueth all things, it hopeth all things, it en∣dureth all things. The contrary to this is rash speaking, and censuring of the sayings and doings of others, slandering, secret whispe∣ring abroad the faults of another, tale-bearing, forbidden, Leuit. 19.16. Thou shalt not walke about with tales a∣mong thy people. We see then how we are to conceiue the dutie propoun∣ded namely thus, our speech must be seasoned with grace, and it must sauour of grace, (that is) it must expresse a reuerent regard both of God and man, it must be a mani∣festation of our modestie, meeknes, sincerity, & a due re∣gard of the good name of others.  Reproofe of such persons as many waies vtter foorth vnsauoury speeches. Now then if wee examine our selues touching this duetie, how farr will manie of vs bee found from that grace that ought to be in our speeches? are there not ma∣ny
that are so far from seasoning of their speech with a re∣uerent regard of the great names of the LORD as that they carelesly vse them in their common talke, and vpon euerie trifling occasion vse to say, O LORD, O GOD Iesus &c. And is the number of those few, that powder their speech not with grace, but with oathes, blasphemies, and cursings? I wish it were not so, but alasse, the number of such is exceeding great, manie there bee that scarse speak a word, but they powder it with an oath, yea, little chil∣dren so soone as they are able to speake, their mouthes are full of oathes, they learne them (no doubt) of their el∣ders, and this is so common a sinne, as wee may iustly say as the Prophet did, Ierem. 23.10. because of oathes the land mourneth; and are there not manie whose mouthes are full of scoffing, scorning, and reproachfull speeches? and as for seasoning our speech with modestie, meeknesse, sincerity, and due regard of others good name, are there not many whose mouthes runne ouer with ribald and fil∣thy speaking, with railing, reuiling, with lying, dissem∣bling, flattering, with vncharitable censuring, with slande∣ring, secret whispering, with tale-bearing? as the Apo∣stle saith, 1. Timoth. 5.13. some goe about from house to house, and are pratlers, and clacke in euerie corner, whatsoeuer they know, and so are sowers of dissention, and makers of strife. Well, let vs take notice of our sinne, and know who∣soeuer thou art, that art guiltie of sinne in anie of these kindes, thou art so farre from gracious speech, as that thy speech is gracelesse and wicked. And as they that haue their speech powdered with grace haue testimonie to their comfort, that their hearts are seasoned with the spirit of grace;Foure mo∣tiues to stir vs vp to haue our speech season∣ed with grace. so thou hast euidence and testimonie to thy terrour, that the Diuell sits and rules in thy heart, and that thy tongue is set on fire of hell, Iam. 3.6. Consider therefore thy fearefull condition, and
the greatnesse of thy sinne, and nowe therefore whilest that thou hast time bee thou humbled for it, and labour henceforward to haue thy speech seasoned with grace, and sauouring of grace; and to that end con∣sider with mee further what Salomon saith, Prou. 20.15. there is golde and a multitude of precious stones, but the lippes of knowledg are a precious iewell, as if hee had sayd, the greatest heape of golde and precious stones, is not to be compared with gracious words, and speech sea∣soned with grace. And againe: Prouerbs 13.2. a man shall eate good thinges by the fruite of his mouth, what bee those good thinges that a man shall eate, as the fruite of his gracious speech? surely, the good will of good men: yea, as Salomon saith, Prou. 22.11. of great men, and Gods blessing, these two are the precious fruites which good and gracious speeches bring foorth, as on the contrarie, speech wanting grace, is like stinking flesh, and it is loathsome and odious to God and good men, if therefore thou wouldest haue testimony to thy comfort, that thy heart is seasoned with grace, if thou wouldest bee enriched with that which is better then golde, or precious stones, if thou wouldest not vtter that which is hatefull to God, and loathsome to all good men, and if thou desire the good will of men, and Gods bles∣sing on thee, then bee thou carefull to haue thy speech seasoned with grace, neuer rest till thou finde that thy speech is the verie image and liuely picture of grace, car∣rying in it and expressing a reuerent regard of God and men, modestie, meekenesse, sinceritie and a due regarde of the good name of others. From this exhortation, let your speech be gracious and powdered with salt. We are further taught thus much.
That our speech must not onely bee a manifestation of  grace that is within, in our hearts, but it must be fit also to worke grace & some good effect in those that heare it;Our speach must not only be a manist¦ation of grace that is in our hearts, but it must also be fit to worke grace in those that heare it. and to this purpose speakes the Apostle plainely. Ephes. 4.29. Let no corrupt communication proceede out of your mouthes, but that which is good, to the vse of edifyinge, that it may minister grace vnto the hearers: as if hee had said, that which is sound, good, and gracious, and serueth to the vse of edifying, and ministring grace vnto the hea∣rers: our speach must be speech of faith, of hope, of loue, of the feare of God, of patience, of comfort, of admoni∣tion, of good counsell and the like. May we not speake of worldly matters? Yes doubtles, we may,  so as our speaches therin sauour of grace, and be for the good of one another:  our speech∣es must bee such, as are fit to minister grace,There is no place for fond foolish idle, and fruitlesse seeches. and good to the hearers; there is no place for fond, and foolish talke, for idle, and fruitlesse wordes. Our Sauiour saith, that of such wordes we shall giue an accompt at the day of judge∣ment. Mat. 12.36. And if wee repent not, euen for them, wee shallbee condemned: our speech must bee such, as may yeelde some good tast, and effect some good in those that heare it: yea, it must be alwayes such, as the Apostle heere saith. Let your speach be gracious alwaies: happilie some will speake religiouslie, at such time as they are pinched by af∣fliction, then they will speake religiouslie, and graciouslie, or before gracious companie, and yet at other times, and before other persons, let loose the bridle of their tongues. But a true beleeuer, must alwaies season his speach with grace▪ and if hee doe it not at all times, and customarilie, hee doth it not for conscience sake; and therefore looke that thy speech, be euer seasoned with grace, and such as is fitte to minister some good to the hearers, and that it may be so, obserue these two rules.Two rules to be obserued, seruing to make our speech fit to minister some good in the hearers.
First, premeditate and forethinke what is fit to bee spo∣ken for the good of others, and let thine heart guide thy mouth, at it is Prou. 16.23. Secondly, sanctifie and offer vp thy speeches to God in praier, pray that the LORD would guide thy tong, and set a watch before thy mouth, and then (doubtlesse) thou shalt bee ab e to vtter gracious wordes, such as are seasoned and sauour of grace, and thou shalt then adde doctrine to thy lippes, Prouerbs the sixteenth and the twenty three, thou shalt so speake, as that others shall bee bettered by thy speech. Now to the second generall part of this verse (that is) the declaration of it, to what end the Colossians should looke that their speech should bee gracious, expressed in these wordes (that yee may knowe how to answer euerie man.) Interpre∣tation.I will briefely deliuer the sence and meaning of the words. That ye may know (that is) that ye may attaine vnto wis∣dome and discretion, and may be able to know how with wisedome and discretion to answer euerie man, the worde (answer) in our common speech hath relation to some question, or demand going before, and to answer (as wee know) is to returne speech to a question or de∣mand according to the purpose and meaning of the que∣stion or demand, but heere it is vsed in a larger sence and signification, it signifies to beginne and to continue speech whether vppon occasion of some question or demand, or otherwise, without occasion ministred by a precedent question or demand. And heere it signifies generally to begin and to conti∣nue speech, wee finde the word (answer) so vsed in manie places of Scripture, Matth. 11.25. it is said, at that time Iesus answered &c. wee finde in that place, no question nor demand going before, and so the word (answered) hath not there respect to anie question or demand fore∣going
but is put to signifie that which hee beganne to speake, and say, so Matth. 28.5. wee finde it is sayd, that the Angell answered, yet notwithstanding there went no question or demand before, and so I might shew it in other places, that the word (answer) is many times vsed according to the Hebrew phrase, and doth ge∣nerally signifie to beginne, and to continue speech, and so it is heere vsed, and is to be taken in that generall sence and signification. Now because an answer (as wee know) is commonly occasioned by a question, or demaund from some other man; and is, or ought to be fitte, and sutable to the questi∣on, or demaund, and made according to the purpose, and meaning of him that makes the question, or demaund: Therefore the Apostle addes (euery man) his meaning is, fitly, and to good purpose, according to the occasion of∣fered from any man. Thus then we are to conceaue these wordes (that yee may knowe how to answere euery man) as if the Apostle had said more plainly thus. That you may attaine to wisdome and discreti∣on, and may be able to knowe how to beginne, and how to continue to speake fitly, and to good pur∣pose, according to each occasion, that is offered vnto you from any man. Wee are to marke and obserue in the first place, that the Apostle did heere exhort the Colossians, that they should haue gracious speech in their mouthes; that their speech should bee euer seasoned with grace, to this end: that they might knowe both what, and howe to speake fitly and to good purpose, vpon euery occasion. Hee saith to them, let your speech bee gracious all∣wayes, and powdred with salt, that yee may knowe howe
to answer euery man that is, how to beginne, and how to continue your speech fitly and to good purpose, hence we may take vp this conclusion. That gracious speech, speech seasoned with  grace and sauouring of grace, is of excellent vse, they that accustome themselues to season their speech with grace, as it were with salt, shall bee able to knowe, both what and how to answer euery man, by con∣tinuall custome and course of speaking holily and graciously, men attaine to spi∣rituall wisedome and discretion, and are thereby enabled to speake fitly, and to good purpose vpon euery occasion.Continuall cusome of speaking holi∣ly and graci∣ously brings men to spiri¦tuall wisdome and enables them to speak fitly, and to good purpose vpon euery occasion. For why? it is not onely true, that from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh, Mat. 12.34. but also from the abundance of the sences, and of the speech the heart thinketh, and according to the speech is the heart affected, and the heart and minde are made either bet∣ter or worse, and not onely the heart and mind of the hea∣rer, but of the speaker, if the speech be vnsound and vnsa∣uorie, it not onely infecteth the hearers, but it sends a stincke backe againe to the heart of the speaker, and makes it fowler then it was before; if the speech be holy and gra∣cious, it is not onely a meanes to worke some good, and to minister grace to others, but it doeth also minister further grace to the speaker himselfe, and his minde is bette framed; and he more plenteously endued with spi∣rituall wisedome, for (indeed) the Lord doth so blesse the vse of gracious and religious speech, as it doth bring forth a soundnesse and dexteritie of iudgement, thereby a man is better enabled to iudge what is most meete
to be spoken and to deliuer it in the best manner, and this is grounded on that Parable of the talents, Matth. 25. which being put forth to vse, bring foorth, or rather bring in as many more, as it is verse 16▪ 17. If a man vse the grace that is in his heart, and expresse it by holy and gracious speaches, he shall gaine, and adde more to it. And hence it is that the preaching of the word is held a very effectuall meanes of increasing all manner of grace in the heart of the Preacher.Note. Howsoeuer some teach others they should not sinne, and yet themselues commit foule sinnes, yet it is not possible, but that one, who is indued with faith, and the Spirit of God, should vtter gracious speeche, to the edification and good of others, and not be wonderfully strengthned, and much increased in all manner of spirtuall grace himselfe; and in this sense it was that the Apostle said to Timothy; These things exercise,1. Tim. 4 15. and giue thy selfe vnto them, that it may bee seene how thou profitest among all men: and so (doubtlesse) it can∣not be, but that any, whosoeuer they bee that haue grace in their hearts, and vse it, and accustome their mouthes to vtter gracious speeches, it cannot bee (I say) but that they should be able to speake wisely, and to good purpose at all times. Wouldest thou then be able to speake fitly, and to good  purpose on euery occasion, as in one particular case, in time of distresse, in time of trouble, and vexation of body or minde, wouldest thou be able to speake a word of com∣fort, and as the Prophet saith, Isai 50 4. Know to minister a word in time to him that is wearie? Oh then let thy tongue be euer powdered with the salt of grace, haue in thy mouth at all other times gracious speeches,Such as desire to speake words of cō∣fort in time to a weary soule, must haue their mouthes at all other times full of graci∣ous speaches. and cer∣tainely then thou shalt not be to seeke of sweete and com∣fortable words in time of neede, many come to their friends whom they loue well, and wish well vnto, in time of their trouble, happily lying on their sicke beds, and are not able to affoord them on word of spiritual comfort,
onely they can vse a common forme of speach, aske them how they doe, and say, they are sorry to see them so, and then they haue done; here is one speciall cause of it, their mouthes are not seasoned with gracious speaches at other times; they vse not to season their speech with grace at o∣ther times, and so it comes to passe that when they should, and (it may bee) would vse gracious and comfortable words, they cannot frame themselues to them, but euen then also, they are out of season with them; learne thou therefore to acquaint thy selfe with holy and religious speaches, let thy mouth at other times be exercised in spea∣king graciously, and then (doubtlesse) though thou canst not speake so eloquently, as some that foame out nothing but goodly speaches, yet thou shalt be able to speak to bet∣ter purpose,Note. because (indeede) it is not mans wit, but Gods grace, that seasons speach, and makes it profitable, and comfortable. Againe, is it so, that by vse and exercise of gracious spea∣ches, men are inabled to speake to good purpose vpon e∣uerie occasion? Surely then it followeth on the contrarie, that through the vse of rotten speach, and of gracelesse speach, men are made vnfit to speake to good purpose, vpon any occasion;Through the vse of rotten and corrupt speach men are made vn∣fit to speake to good pur∣pose vpon a∣ny occasion. they that accustome their tongues to speake words gratefull to none, but to the Deuill, and damnable men, what doe they? Surely they make them∣selues vnable to speake to good purpose at any time, and they are not able to speake well, and to good purpose, when there is most need of good speach, as happily when themselues lie on their death beds, they are vnable to vt∣ter one word of spirituall comfort; but (as the Preacher saith) The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishnesse, and the latter end of his mouth is wicked madnesse.Eccles. 10.3. A wicked man whose mouth is ful of wicked gracelesse speaches, his wordes beginne in folly, and for the most part, they end in madnesse; lamentable experience shewes it, that such as accustome their mouthes to vtter rotten and corrupt
speach in their life time, when they come to the houre of death, they commonly know not what to speake, or how to vtter any word of sound comfort, they either lie like stockes, or stones, or they speake idly, and vainely; and (indeede) it is iust with the Lord they should be so puni∣shed; as they loued cursing, so shall it come vnto them, and as they loued not blessing, so shall it bee farre from them: As they loued gracelesse speach in their health, so it is iust with the Lord, that in their sicknesse they should be able to vtter that only which is gracelesse, and voide of all true comfort: thinke on this, and consider it,Psal. 109.17. thou that art a common swearer, a railer, or the like, thy words are not winde, they passe not away with the speaking; no, no, thou that dost belch out bitter blasphemy, and other cursed speaches, thou dost not onely thereby offend God, and grieue Gods children, and make thy selfe liable to the curse of God, as other greeuous sinners doe,Note. but thou prouokest the Lord to follow thee with his punishment in this particular kinde, that as thou hast beene gracelesse in thy speach in thy life time, so thou shouldest not haue a word of grace, and sound comfort in thy death; there∣fore remember thou swearer, thou railer, or the like, by thy swearing, or railing, thou dost euen shut vp thy owne mouth, that thou shalt not know how to vtter one word of comfort in time of thy distresse, and in the houre of death, and as thou dost tender the comfort of thine own soule, in the time of great distresse, put away swearing, railing, and all manner of corrupt and rotten spea∣king. Now from the wordes themseues, in that the Apostle saith heere, that yee may know how to answer euery man. Wee are taught in the next place. That a Christian must haue in him a knowledge, hee must know how to speake as occasion is offered,A Christian must know how to speak when hee is demanded any thing that pertaines to his Christian faith and pro∣fession. especially if he be demanded any thing pertaining to his Christian faith, and profession, 1 Pet. 3.15. Bee ready alwaies to
giue answer to euery man that asketh you a reason of the hope th i in you. A Ch istian must bee euer ready and prepared to giue an account of his faith, and of his hope of saluation. This (for the vse of it) first meets with that grosse opini∣on of our aduersaries, the Papists, touching implicite faith,Confutation of Popih im∣plicit faith. faith infolded in the faith of the Church: the Iesuits teach, that Lay people are not bound to know what matters of faith be: ignorance (say they) is better, it sufficeth if they consent to the faith of the Church whatsoeuer it bee, which is a crosse absurde heresie. If a Christian must know how to answer, and must be ready to yeeld an account of hi faith, certainely then hee must know the doctrine of faith, and of Christian hope, it cannot otherwise be. For the vse of this point to our selues; is it so that a Christian must know how to speake of Christian faith, and be able to giue a good answer to one that demands a reason of his hope? Oh then let most take notice of it, that they are farre short of that knowledge that ought to be in them: be there not many, and those, not of the yonger sort, but of great yeeres, that are not able to giue any good account of their faith?Reproofe of such as are not able to giue any good account of their faith. If they be examined tou∣ching Originall sinne, iustification in the sight of God, and the like points, whereof they haue often heard? yet they are not able to giue any good and direct answer; and let it shame vs of this, (indeed) we ought to bee ashamed, hast thou liued many yeeres vnder the teaching of the word? Dost thou heare the doctrine of faith, and heauenly know∣ledge from day to day, and is it not a shamefull thing that thou shouldest be vnable to render a reason, and giue any good account of thy faith? Thinke on it, and let it shame thee indeed, and neuer rest, till thou know how to answer any that shall aske thee a reason of thine hope. Now heere a question may bee moued; it may bee de∣manded, whether a Christian bee bound to answer euerie one that shall aske him any thing of his Christian profe∣ssion.
No, indeed a Christian is bound to make a iust apology of his faith, and ought to defend the truth,  and euerie title and iotte of it, when Gods glory is endangered, and when he is called, though before vnbeleeuers; but if any propound the question with a purpose to deride the truth, he is not to be answered, wee haue the example of our Sa∣uiour not to answer such a question, Mat. 26.63. & cap. 27 14. and we haue his commandement, Mat. 10.17. beware of men, and therefore we are not to answer such as aske vs something of our Christian profession, with a manifest purpose to scorne the truth. From these words (That yee may know how to answer eue∣rie man.) We are further taught. That our speach must be fitly applied, it must be as an  answere to a question, it must bee to the present pur∣pose, there ought to bee in Christians an holy discretion, and they must not only know what to speake, but also how to speake fitly, they must not only be able to enforme the ignorant, to rebuke the vnruly, to strengthen the weake, to comfort and encourage the feeble, and fearefull, and such like, but they must doe these things, so, as they may doe most good. To that end, they must haue regard of all due circumstances,Christians must not only know what to speake, but also how to speake fitly to the present purpose, & so as they may do most good. To that ende all due circum¦stances must be considered they must make their speach fit to the cir∣cumstances of times, persons, and places, Prouerb. 29.11. A foole (saith Salomon) powreth out all his minde: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterward.  A wise man obserues due circumstances of time, place, and persons, Pro. 15.23. How good is a word in due season. Some priuate Christians be∣ing able to giue good counsel, or to admonish and reproue others,Reproofe of them who ob¦serue not due circumstances in admoni∣shing or repro¦uing of others yet many times faile in fitting their speach to cir∣cumstances, they tell a man of his fault being drunke, or in the heat of his passion, or they admonish and reproue such as are not fit to be admonished or reproued. Who are they that are not fit to be reproued? They be of two sorts. First, naturall fooles, Pro. 26.4. Answer not a foole accor∣ding  to his foolishnesse, lest thou be also like him.
Verse 5. It i said, Answer a foole, according to his foolish∣nesse, lest he be wise in his own conceit. There be two sorts of fooles, naturall fooles, and con∣ceited fooles; naturall foole are not to bee answered ac∣cording to their folly, but conceited fooles are to bee an∣swered, their errour is to be confuted, and their misdemea∣nour to be reproued, that perceiuing their dotage and sin, they may be humbled,  and so are these two verses to bee reconciled. Secondly, such as be obstinate scorners, Prou. 9.8. Re∣buke not a scorner least he hate thee. And our Sauiours rule is, Mat. 7.6. Giue yee not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast yee your pearles before Swine. If thou (being a priuate Christian) be certaine that thy admonition, or reproofe will doe no good, but that the parties reproued wil tram∣ple them vnder their feet as things of naught, thou art not to admonish, or reproue them, but rather be silent, or se∣parate from them; for if thou goe beyond thy boundes against the rule of Christ, where is thy warrant of safetie against the malice of wicked and violent persons? Surely it comes to passe sometimes, that a priuate Christian ad∣monishing, or reprouing wicked persons for their sinnes, not obseruing due circumstances, doth expose himselfe to their malice, and they runne on him, and as madde dogges rent him, and teare him; yea, and sometimes put him out of patience, and due moderation; therefore in thy admonition, in thy reproofe, and in all thy gracious spea∣ches haue regard to all due circumstances, and let thy speach bee fitly applied in respect of persons, places, and times, Prou. 25.11. A word spoken in his place is like Aples of gold with pictures of siluer, holy and gracious speach is com∣mendable in it selfe, but when it is vttered in due time, and place, it is exceeding gracious and pleasant, it is plea∣sing to God, and it becomes profitable to others, and comfortable to thine owne soule and conscience.
VER. 7. Tychicus our beloued brother, and faithfull Minister, and fellow seruant in the Lord, shall declare vnto you my whole estate. 8. Whom I haue sent vnto you for the same pur∣pose, that hee might know your state, and might comfort your hearts. 9 With Onesimus a faithfull and a beloued bro∣ther, who is one of you. They shall shew you of all things heere. The Apostle hauing finished the first generall part of this Chapter (namely) his exhortation to some generall duties. In this seuenth verse he enters on the second generall part of it, containing the conclusion of his whole Epistle,The second generall part of this Chap∣ter, and the conclusion of this whole Epistle. the particular parts and branches of his conclusion wee haue heeretofore laid foorth. The first is laid downe in the 7.8. and 9. verse and is a declaration of the Apostles owne loue, and care of the Colossians, expressed by sending certaine messengers vn∣to them, to acquaint them with his estate, and generally with the estate of the Church where he was, and also to vn¦derstand their estate, and to comfort, and confirme their hearts; that is the some and substance of these three verses. In them, we haue more particularly these two things offered to our consideration. First, the persons whom the Apostle sent, and emploi∣ed  in his message. Secondly, the ends and causes wherefore he sent them. The persons he sent, were Tychichus, and Onesimus, and both these he describes, and commendes to the Colossi∣ans,
to be worthy persons, by certaine excellent quallities. As first, in the 7. verse, hee commends Tychicus both by that which was common to him with all true beleeuing Christians, that hee was a brother, to which hee addes the adiunct and epithite (beloued) (Tychicus our beloued bro∣ther) and then by that which was more proper, and pecu∣liar to him, in respect of his calling and function, as that he was, First, a Minister, Secondly, more specially, a fellow-seruant with the Apostle in the Lords businesse. And to both these, he addes the adiunct (faithfull) and faithfull Minister. Secondly, he likewise commends Onesimus verse 9. First, by the title (brother) to which hee ioines two E∣pithites (faithfull, and beloued) With Onesimus a faithfull and beloued brother. And secondly, by the particular relation that was be∣tweene Onesimus and the Colossians, that hee was one of them. Now the endes and causes wherefore the Apostle sends these two worthy persons to the Colossians, are two. First, to let them vnderstand, both his state particular∣ly, verse 7. (shall declare vnto you my whole state) and the things done where he was, generally, verse 9. (They shall shew you of all things heere.) And secondly, that by them the Apostle might bee certified of the estate of the Colossians, and they be com∣forted by those hee sent vnto them, chieflie by Tychicus, a faithfull Minister; therefore he saith, verse 8. Whom I haue sent vnto you for the same purpose, that he might know your state and comfort your hearts. And thus we haue the resolution of these three verses. I take them together, because they make but one con∣text. In further handling of them, I will first speake of the
persons that were sent, and then of the ends, and causes of their sending. And fo the persons before we come to speake of them seueraly we may obserue thus much in generall. The Apostle sent not one messenger alone, but two to∣gether, though Tychicus was a worthy messenger, and fit for the dispatch of the businesse alone, yet with him hee sent Onesimus, no doubt in these respects, both to make the message of more authority, the things that concerned eyther party being confirmed by the testimony of two wit∣nesses, and for the mutuall comfort and aid which they might haue of each other, both in their journey, and in their businesse there, and for these causes (no doubt) it was, that our Sauiour sent out his twelue Apostles two by two Mark. 6.7. and so the 70. disciples, two and two be∣fore him, Luke 10.1. Hence we may gather the wisedome and care that ought to bee vsed in matters and businesses of waight and importance, especially in businesses of the Church, both in regard of the busines it selfe, and of the persons imployed in the same, but on that I will not stand, onely obserue we generally touching the persons sent by the Apostle thus much. That the Apostle did commend the persons whom hee sent on his message, & he set them out by sundry excellent qualities, and titles of honor, he said not barely, I haue sent to you one named Tychicus, & an other whose name is One∣simus, but I haue sent to you Tichicus, a man excellently qualified, a b loued brother and faithfull minister with O∣nesimus also a man worthy commendation, beeing a faith∣full nd a beloued brother, who is one of you: as if the A∣postle had saide, I haue sent vnto you, men whom you may safely credit and beleeue, and the report and message they bring you, is to bee regarded, because I know they are good men, and I dare boldly commend them to you for such as wil speake the trueth, and make conscience of that they deliuer vnto you.
This no doubt was the Apostles drift and purpose, in commending his messengers sent to the Colossians, whence we may gather thus much. That the dignitie and goodnesse of the person or per∣sons bee it one or more, that are sent on a message of weight and importance, is of great force to giue enter∣tainment to the message that is brought, when the mes∣senger is knowne to be an honest man, and of good cre∣dit, and one fearing God, the message that he brings, is the better credited, the honestie, fidelitie and good qualities of the messenger commonly makes the message more welcome and better regarded. As Dauid concluded of Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadoke,  2. Sam: 18.27. he is a good man, therefore he commeth with good tidings:The honestie, fidelitie and good qualities of the messen∣ger, common∣ly makes the message more welcome and better regar∣ded. and so many times the good opinion that men haue of the honestie and goodnesse of the mes∣senger, that brings them any tidings, it swayes much with them to beleeue his report, and to giue great regard to it: common experience shewes this to be true, euen in ciuill businesses and matters of the world: and no doubt thus it is also in the heauenly message, and in bringing the glad tidings of the gospell, if such as are the Lords messengers, imployed in bringing the comfortable newes of salua∣tion, be knowne to be men well qualified, not onely with knowledge and vtterance, but with sanctified hearts and liues, oh it strikes a great respect of that which they bring, and preuailes much for the entertainment and reuerent regard of the message they deliuer to Gods people: for howsoeuer in that holy businesse, men ought to looke ra∣ther to the message then to the messenger that brings it: yet indeed the multitude and greatest part, rather cast their eye on the messenger, than on the message, and ac∣cording as the messenger is, either good or ill, so they re∣gard the message it selfe. We read Mark: 6.20. Herod did many things that Iohn Baptist taught, not because Iohn was an excellent teacher, but because he was a good man, so
saith the text, Herod knowing that Iohn was a iust man and holy, he reuerenced him, he did manie thinges, and heard him gladly. Now heere occasion is giuen to reprooue some, who  beeing sent on the Lordes embassage to the people, yet care not how basely, and how offensiuely they carrie themselues in the sight of those to whom they are sent,Reproofe of such ministers▪ as carry them selus basely & offensiuely in the sight of those to whom they are sent. and to exhort and stir them vp that as they would see any due regard of the message they bring to Gods people, and any good fruit of it, yea, as they tender the comfort of their owne soules in the great day of the Lord, so they would bee carefull to shewe themselues not onely able messengers, but good and godly messengers of the Lord, and that they would make it appeare, that they not onely call others to a fellowshippe and communion with Christ, but that themselues also haue true fellowshippe and com∣munion with him, and that it may be truely sayd of them as heere of Tychicus, that they are beloued brethren. Wee for our parts are to pray for this, that seeing the  regard of the Lords heauenly message depends much on the quality of the person of the messengers, and is com∣monly greater or lesse, as the messengers that bring it are qualified, and as they are either good or bad, it would please the Lord, to make all that are sent about his holy businesse, aswell godly men as good schollers,We are to pray that all that are sent about the Lords holy businesse may be as well godly men as good schol∣lers. and that they may be as well sanctified in their hearts and liues, as in their doctrine sound and good, otherwise certainly wo∣full experience will shew it, that they shall pull downe as much with their liues, as they build vp with their doctrin. Come now we to speak of the persons seuerally, & first of Tychicus & his commendation, in these words (Tychicus our beloued brother, and faithfull minister, and fellow-seruant in the Lord) what Tychicus was by birth, in respect of the country, we find Act. 20.4. that he was borne in Asia, and that hee went with Paul going thither to preach the Gos∣pell, but for his description, heere Paul cals him.
First (a beloued brother) a brother not by birth or bloud,Interpre∣tation. or in respect of country (as the word brother) is often vsed in Scripture, but in respect of religion, and profession of the same true faith of Christ, so are all true Christians, all that professe the same faith of Christ called, Mat. 23.8. one is your Doctor, to wit Christ, and all ye are brethren, so in ma∣ny other places of Scripture, and the Apo∣stle addes (beloued) thereby signifying that hee was worthy to bee beloued of all true Christians, for his piety, religion and godly life. Secondly, he cals him (faithfull Minister) that is, one who did serue Christ in the mi∣nistry, and preaching of the Gospell, and in that office, he did answer that trust that was reposed in him. He addes (and fellow-seruant in the Lord) that is, one that serues the same Lord that I do, euen the Lord Iesus Christ in the holy ministry, and laboreth in the ministry of the word together with mee: this then is the meaning of the Apostle, as if he had said. Tychicus who is one professing the same true faith with vs, one (no doubt) beloued of God, and one whom I loue, and worthy to bee beloued of all true Christians, and one that doth faithfully serue Christ, in the ministry and preaching of his Gospell, yea, and labours together with mee, in the ministrie of the word, he shall declare vnto you my whole state. Note we heere, in the first place, that the Apostle com∣mending Tychicus, he giues him these titles, as titles of ho∣nour and dignitie, that hee was a beloued brother, and faithfull Minister, and fellow-seruant in the Lord, hee
thought hee could not better grace him, and set him out, then by these titles, a brother in Christ, a Minister of the gospell, and a fellow-seruant in the Lord; hence then it is cleare. That these are indeed stiles and titles of great honour,  and it is an excellent priuiledge and preferment to bee a brother in Christ, a Minister of the gospell, and to be spe∣cially employed in that seruice.It is a great honour, to be a brother in Christ, a mi∣nister of the gospell, and to be specially imployed in that seruice. It is said, Ioh: 1 12. As many as receiued him, to them he gaue power (or rather as the word signifies prerogatiue and priuiledge) to be the sonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his name. Where the Euangelist teacheth, that as many as receiue Christ, as many as truly beleeue in Christ, and are true beleeuing members of Christ, and so brethren one to another in Christ, they haue this priuiledge and preferment, to bee the sonnes of God, the excellencie of which honour is vnspeakable: and if to this bee added, some speciall and proper title, as to bee a Minister of the gospell, it must needs bee an exceeding great honour; I  might shew it in particular, that to haue the title of a faith∣full Minister, is a matter of speciall honour and prefer∣ment, and therefore it is an audacious and monstrous im∣pietie, that is found in some scoffing and prophane wret∣ches, who dare turne that which the Lord hath giuen as an honour, and glory to his seruants, into matter of scorne and contempt.It is mon∣strous impie∣tie to turne the titles of honor, which God hath gi∣uen to his ser∣uants into matter of scorne and contempt. To say in way of scoffing, oh he is a bro∣ther forsooth, or he is one of the brotherhood, and what is he but a pild Priest, or a pelting Minister, and such like. Such sonnes of Beliall, and such prophane scoffers there be in the world: well, let it not discourage any that is (in∣deed)  of the brotherhood with the members of Iesus Christ,It is matter of comfort to be of the bro∣therhood with the members of Iesus Christ. that is a title of honour and glory, that the God of glory hath vouchsafed to set on his dearest children, and this is our reioycing, (euen as many of vs as are true beleeuers) that the Lord hath vouchsafed to ho∣nour vs not with vaine puffes of worldly honour,
but with such honour as shall neuer bee taken from vs, yea, though wee haue onelie the common title of Gods children, the title of beloued brethren, truely giuen unto vs, it is enough to fill our hearts with ioy, and our mouth with laughter for euermore, that beeing a greater digni∣tie, then to bee sonnes and heires to the greatest Monarch in the world, for then we are the sonnes and heires to the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, and heires of a King∣dome not earthly, but in the highest heauens. Now more specially from the first of these titles (belo∣ued brother) in that the Apostle calles Tychicus a brother, and he adioynes (beloued) a brother in Christ, a true Chri∣stian, and so beloued of God, and beloued of the Apostle himselfe, and worthy to be beloued of al Christians: hence we are taught thus much. That if a man be a true beleeuing Christian & so our brother in the Lord,Though we are to loue all men, yet more specially and more entirely are we to loue the Saints and children of God who are ou brethren in Christ. we are bound euen in that respect much more tenderly to embrace him in our hearts, and to loue him, howsoeuer, Christian loue must reach ge∣nerally to all men, as they are men and rea∣sonable creatures, and wee must loue euen the wicked and vnbeleeuing, as partakers of the same nature, as they haue title to the same common redemption, & as they haue in them the remainders of Gods image, yet in more speciall manner, and with more en∣tire and hearty affection, are we to loue the Saints and children of God, who haue vni∣on and coniunction with vs in Christ. For indeed the order of Christian loue is this,The order of Christian loue wee are first to loue God simplie for himselfe, and then all that beare his image for his sake, and among these, those that beare Gods image, more especially, to loue them that are
renued according to Gods image in holinesse, and excell others in spirituall graces, Psal. 16.3. my well doing (saith Dauid) extendeth to the Saints and to them that excell in vertue, Gal. 6 10. let vs doe good vnto all men, but espe∣cially vnto them which are of the houshold of faith, our doing good is a fruit of our loue, and it must bee extended especially to the houshold of faith, the obiect of our loue is all men generally, it must bee set on all, as they beare Gods image, but chiefely on the members of Christ, the Saints and children of God, in whom are manifest arguments and signes of true and vnfained holinesse and religion. What then shall wee say to many in the worlde, who  are so farre from bearing special loue to such as haue Gods image renued in them, or anie sparke of grace wrought in their hearts, and appearing in their liues, as that there∣vpon they hate them, and because they haue brother-hood with the members of Christ, they cannot abide them, but carrie themselues spitefully towards them, and set their chiefe delight and loue on those who beare the image of Satan,Many iustly reprooud who hate them that are renued accor¦ding to Gods image, and spitefully a∣buse them, & loue and de∣light in them who beare the image of Satan. and are brethren in euill, and mates and compani∣ons in drunkennesse, in swearing, and the like, surely, I may say as the Holy Ghost hath taught mee, 1. Ioh. 3.12. they are as Kaine was, of that euill one, Satan, they are yet to bee reputed, both in their owne, and other mens iudg∣ments, children of the Diuell, Kaine flew his brother, and why? because as it followeth, his owne workes were euill and his brothers good, the old serpent Satan, hath not yet cast his skin, he still sowes dislike among men, and for the same cause, we finde it too common, where some are true∣ly fearing GOD, and religious, they make themselues a prey, Isai. 59.15. others that are wicked, euen in that re∣spect, hate them, gnash their teeth at them, cannot abide them, but let such know, as they are like Kaine in sinne, so it cannot bee, but if they goe on in that sinne, they shall at length bee like him in punishment, the hand and
curse of God shall ouertake them. Let vs learne to loue men bearing Gods image, be∣cause they beare his image, a beleeuer, because hee is a beleeuer and a godly man or woman, because they are godly,We are to loue them that beare Gods i∣mage because they beare it, and a godly man or wo∣man because they are god∣ly. and to perswade vs to it: knowe wee then thus much. That this is an infallible note of the true childe of God, 1. Iohn 3.14. wee know that wee are translated from death to life because wee loue the brethren, and Dauid makes this a speciall note of him that shall dwell in the Lords tabernacle,This is a spe∣ciall note that we are Gods children. Psal. 15.4. that hee is one in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but hee maketh much of those that feare the LORD; would wee then bee infal∣libly assured that wee are the children of God? euery one (no doubt) would haue that assurance, & euery one ma∣king shew of religion,How we may be sure that our hearts are mooued with a sanctified motion of loue. will flatter, himselfe, that hee is a childe of God, but would wee certainely knowe it, then let vs loue them that feare God, and beare Gods image, euen because they beare his image, because they are godly and religious, & that we deceiue not our selues in this. Let vs loue with speciail loue euerie one, in whom wee discerne anie measure of sanctifying grace, according to the measure of grace, without partiality, and without respect of persons; for (happily) wee may loue some that are renued according to Gods image, some that are holy and religious, because they are kind to vs, and in respect of our owne profit, or some other by-respect, and yet not loue others, as holy and religious as they, be∣cause they are not so kinde, and so beneficiall vnto vs in outward things, that is, to loue as the Publicanes did, of whom Christ saith, Mat. 5.47. that they are friendly to their friends; and that loue may be in them, that are yet in the corruption of nature. If therefore thou wouldest bee sure that thine heart
is mooued with an holy and sanctified motion of loue, then loue them that are holy, and religious, whatsoeuer they be, yea though they haue many infirmities in them, and though they bee thine enemies, but yet loue them so farre as they beare the image of GOD euen be∣cause they beare his image, loue euerie brother be∣cause hee is a brother in CHRIST, and that will bee to thee an infallible note that thou art a childe of GOD, and it will certainely seale it vp to the comfort of thy soule, that thou art in the state of grace in this life, and shalt be partaker of the glory of Gods children in the life to come. In the next place we are to obserue that the Apostle com∣mending Tychicus in regard of his calling and function, that he was a Minister, and one that did serue Christ in the ministrie of of the Gospell, and one that labored together with him in that calling, hee giues to these titles the ad∣iunct or epithite, faithfull (and faithfull Minister) wee see he doth not commend Tichicus a Minister for his wit, his learning, his eloquence, his grauitie, &c. that hee was a learned, an eloquent, or great Minister, (though these be good and commendable things in a Minister) but hee commends him for his faithfulnesse, that hee was faith∣full in his Ministrie and did answer that trust that was reposed in him in discharge of his dutie. Hence then we may gather. That the chiefe ornament and that which most com∣mends  a Minister of Christ in regard of the execution of his office,The chiefe ornament of a Minister of Christ is faith fulnes in the execution of his office. is to be faithfull, it is the best epithite of praise that can be giuen to a minister of the Gospell, that hee is faithfull, and that he is one that doth vse the talent and gift bestowed on him for the best aduantage of gaining glorie to Christ, his Lord, and of good to his people, and that in the performance of such duties as concerne him, hee doth answere that trust that is reposed in him.
1. Cor. 4.2. As for the rest it is required of the disposers that euery man be found faithfull, as if he had said, as for the other things, or howsoeuer hee bee carefull for other things, it is not so much materiall, but it is especially re∣quired of a Minister of the Gospell, that hee bee faithfull, and (indeed) faithfulnesse is required of a Minister in eue∣rie ministeriall action, that in teaching, in exhorting, in comforting, in reprehending, and such like, he bee found faithfull, and without faithfulnesse he can doe no dutie of his calling, pleasing to God, or profitable to men. I haue heeretofore handled this point, Cap. 1.7. and therefore I now touch it in a word. Now in the last place from this commendation of Ty∣chicus, note we, that the Apostle, though he was an Apo∣stle, and Tychicus (no doubt) but an ordinarie Minister, yet he calles him fellow seruant (Tychicus our beloued bro∣ther, and faithfull Minister, and fellow seruant.) Wee see then. That euen ordinarie Ministers of the Gospell, such as are truly called to that office and function, are fellow∣seruants with the Apostles of Christ,Ordinarie Ministers that are truely called to that office, are fellow-ser∣uants with the Apostles. though indeed, there is difference in degree betweene an ordinarie Minister, and an Apostle: an Apostle being a minister of a higher sort, and that by the ordinance of God, yet ordinarie Mi∣nisters serue the same Lord that the Apostles did, euen the Lord Iesus Christ. And that is a matter of great comfort to all true Mini∣sters of the Gospell, faithfully labouring in their calling,Comfort to all true Mini∣nisters of the Gospell, who faithfully la∣bour in their calling. they are thereby assured of the assistance of Gods Spirit in teaching, of his protection ouer them in their Ministrie, and that they shall be rewarded in the end, with an eternal waight of glorie, as certainly as the Apostles that are in heauen, they serue the same most powerful, good, and gra∣cious Lord, the Apostles did, and seruing him, they can∣not be disappointed of their hope.
Come we now to the description of Onesimus. VER. 9 With Onesimus a faithfull and a beloued bro∣ther, who is one of you. This Onesimus (no doubt) was the same man that was seruant to Philemon, who both robbed his master,Interpre∣tation. and ran away from him, whom Paul after that hauing wonne to Christ, and begotten in his bonds, as he saith, Philem: epist. vers. 10. he sent againe to his master crauing pardon for him. Now him, the Apostle calles not onely (beloued bro∣ther) but he addes (faithfull) thereby meaning, that hee was an honest, and trusty brother, and he thus commends Onesimus, lest vpon his former fault, and fraud, the Colos∣sians should take occasion to set light by him, and the A∣postle further commends him, that hee was one of them (that is) one of the same Countrey, and (it may bee) of the same Citie with the Colossians, and a member of their Church. Now for the matter of doctrine offered vnto vs from this commendation of Onesimus, (passing by that which was common to him with Tychicus, as that hee was a be∣loued brother) wee are to marke heere that the Apostle calles him a faithfull brother; thereby shewing that how∣soeuer he had beene in former time faulty, in deceiuing of his Master; yet now beeing conuerted, and hauing repented of that sinne, the Apostle did not so much as thinke of his former fault, but now esteemed him as an honest, and trusty brother, and so calles him, and would  haue others so to thinke of him. Hence wee are plainely taught thus much. That the falles and faults of men after their true repen∣tance and conuersion to the Lord, are to bee forgotten of vs,The falles & faults of men after their true repen∣tance and tur∣n ng to the Lord are to bee forgotten of vs. no mans sinne which hee hath truely repented of, ought to be any disparagement to him in after time, wee
are not to haue any man in lesse esteeme, or to thinke the worse of him for his sinne in former time committed, if he haue truely repented of his sinne, and good fruits of amendement doe budde foorth, and shew themselues in his life, and conuersation, but we are rarher after the ex∣ample of the Apostle in this place to commend him, as far as truth will beare, and to speake of the graces of God, that are in him. Luk. 7. We finde, that when a certaine woman that had beene a notorious sinner came to Christ, sitting in the Pharisies house, though she washed his feet with teares and shewed forth token of vnfained repentance, and loue, yet the Pharisie that had bidden Christ, still esteemed of the woman as shee had beene in times past, and said with∣in himselfe, verse 39 Surely, this man is not a Prophet, if he were, hee would haue knowne who, and what manner of woman this is which toucheth him, for shee is a sinner: this secret thought and close biting censure of the Phari∣sie, our Sauiour, who knew his heart, brought to light, and he reproued it. First, by propounding to him a Parable, from the 40. verse to the 47. and in the 47. verse, he doth directly check his hard conceit of the woman, and telles him, that hee thought amisse of her: I say to thee, many sins are forgi∣uen her for she loued much, as if he had said, thou iudgest amisse of this woman, thou art not to deeme of her accor∣ding to her former life past, knowne to thee to be wicked, and sinnefull, but as shee now is, truly penitent, and shew∣ing her selfe an humble penitentiarie, iudge of her by her loue, which is an infallible proofe of her acquittance, and discharge from her sinnes, plainely teaching the point I haue now propounded, that we are not to think, or esteem the worse of any one, that hath beene knowne in former times to be faulty, if so be now we see visible and apparant signes of his vnfained repentance, but we are to thinke and speake of him as now he is.
And the reasons of this are these. First, in regard of God that hee may bee glorified in the conuersion of sinners, for the worse they haue beene be∣fore, the greater is Gods mercy and power in their amend∣ment, and his mercy towards them therein ought the more to be acknowledged, and he the more magnified for the same accordingly. Secondly, in respect of the person himselfe that hath repented, that he may be encouraged, and fully perswa∣ded of the good estimation hee is in with men, for howso∣euer his conscience, after his true repentance, doe assure him of Gods fauour towards him, yet his weakenesse will easily make him suspect, that hee is contemned of men, or that howsoeuer they make shew of esteeming him, yet some hard conceit still stickes in their minde against him. And lastly, in regard of other men, to whom his labours and endeauours, though neuer so well performed, shall be of little force or fruit, except their bee a good opinion conceiued of him, for these reasons wee are not to thinke, or speake the worse of any that hath beene heereto∣fore knowne to bee guilty of some great sinne, if now hee haue repented, and doe shew euident signes of sound repentance. First, therefore such persons are iustly to bee taxed, and much to bee blamed, who if once they know another to be guilty of some great sinne, euer after that, carry a foule suspition of that partie, and though they see ma∣nifest tokens of repentance,Reproofe of them who once know∣ing another to be guilty of some great sinne, euer af¦ter thinke hardly of that partie though they see mani∣fest tokens of his repentāce. yet will neuer bee satisfied, but are alwaies suspicious, and take it as a maxime or ground, hee or shee, that is once found to bee euill is alwaies supposed to bee euill; yea some are so rash and so vnaduised, that they are ready on euery iarre, and difference, to cast that in the teeth of another, which happily the Lord hath cast behinde his backe, and for∣giuen the partie hauing truely repented.
This ought not so to be, thou art not to thinke, or speake the worse of any, whose sinne hath been open to the sight of the world, if now hee haue repented of his sinne, and now carrie in his body and life, the markes of true repen∣tance; consider with thy selfe, that thou wouldest bee loath to haue that throwne in thy dish, thou hast done a∣misse in former times, if thou haue beene truely humbled for it; remember then to deale with others, as thou woul∣dest be dealt withall thy selfe: and for this point I say no more but this, take heed thou condemne not him, whom (it may bee) God hath acquitted, set not thou a curse where thou seest the print of Gods blessing, and doe not thou load them with heauy burdens, whom (for any thing that thou knowest) Christ himselfe hath disburdened; if thou so doe, thou makest thy selfe odious in the sight of God. Prou. 17.15. Hee that iustifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the iust, and whom God hath iustified, euen they both are an abomination to the Lord. Againe, is it so, that the falles and faults of men after their true repentance are to bee forgotten by others,Comfort to such as haue been guilty of foule sins, but now are truly humbled for the same. and are not to be cast in their teeth, and they are not to bee vp∣braided with them? Heere is then matter of great com∣fort to all such as haue beene heertofore ouertaken with foule sinnes, but now are truly humbled for the same, and doe testifie their repentance by bringing foorth newe fruits, men are not to obiect these sinnes to them, if they doe, it is either malice, or rashnesse in them, it is their sin; yea further, if thou hast beene faulty in some foule sinne in times past, and hast truely repented of thy sinne: know it to thy comfort,Note. the deuill himselfe is not to vpbraid thee with it, he cannot lay it to thy charge, if hee doe at any time obiect to thee thy life past, on this ground thou maist repell his obiection, and maiest boldly say vnto him, tell me not what I haue beene, but tell mee what I am, and what I will bee by Gods grace heereafter, I confesse (in∣deed) to the glorie of Gods power, and mercy, I haue
beene thus or thus faulty, but now as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 6.11. I am washed, now I am sanctified, I am iustified in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the spirit of my God, and the Lord now accepts mee not as I haue beene, but as I am; and therefore auoid Satan, be packing, thou art not to obiect to me my former sinne, thus may euery one that hath truely repented his former grosse sinne, an∣swer the Diuell, obiecting to him his life past, and this is a singular comfort to all true repentant sinners, and let none but such take hold of this comfort, let not such as liue in their sinnes, catch at this, it belongs not vnto them, but if thou hast beene a greeuous sinner heeretofore, and now art humbled truely for thy sinnes, and truely repen∣tant, heere is comfort for thee, I speake it for thy comfort alone, neither men nor deuils are to obiect to thee thy former sinnes, if they doe, it is nothing, the Lord doth iustify thee, and who shall condemne thee? and thinke on it to thy comfort. One thinge yet remaines in the commendation of One∣simus, the Apostle addes (who is one of you) as if hee had said. Onesimus is on of your owne citie, and a mem∣ber of your Church, therefore you ought the more to esteeme him. Hence we are taught. That euen naturall and ciuill respects in which men partake one with another, as consanguinity, affinitie,If men be con¦ioined not only by the bond of one faith and re∣lig on, but al∣so by some naturall or ci∣uil bond, they are in that re∣spect bound to loue and regard on an∣other more tenderly. nati∣on, countrie with the like, should be to them causes of greater mutuall loue one towardes another, if men be con∣ioyned not only in fellowship of the same faith and religi∣on, but also by some naturall or ciuil bond, they are in that respect bound more tenderly to loue and regard one ano∣ther. And on this ground (no doubt) it was that the Apostle said 1. Tim. 5.8. if any prouide not for his owne, namely, for them of his houshold, he denieth the faith and is worse
then an idll; a man is especially to loue, and regard hose that are more neerely knit to him, by the bond of nature,  or by any other speciall bond whatsoeuer, it is our common fault that we esteeme them least that are of our selue,Reproofe of them who re¦gard those least who are of themselues. in regard of the familiaritie wee haue with them, or because their infirmities are best knowne vnto vs, and it i hard to finde neighbours to agree together, euen because they are neighbours, and daily conuerse one with another, what iarres and differences do dailie rise betweene neigh∣bour and neighbour, and betweene such as dwell the next doore one to another, we finde it too common a thing; well, let vs remember, that our neighbourhood ought to binde vs more neerely together in spirituall loue one to a∣nother, and when thou art stird vp by the Deuill, and thine owne corruption, to iarre, and to fall out with thy neigh∣bours, thinke thus with thy selfe. Shall I fall out with him? no; besides the common bond of Christianitie I am bound to him, with a more speciall bond of neighbour∣hood, he is of the same parish, and of the same particular congregation with mee, and therefore I ought the more to loue and regard him, euen in that respect, let vs remem∣ber that we are taught by the same word, fed at the same ta∣ble of the Lord, led along by the same waters of comfort, and we rest in the same fold, and let vs in regard of that neere coniunction, more tenderly loue and regard one another, that so hauing mutuall loue, and fellowship one with another in this life, we may (through Gods mer∣cie) haue eternall fellowship, and communion together in the life to come. Hauing now spoken of the persons whom the Apostle sent to the Colossians, and of the commendations he gaue them, come we to speake of the ends, and causes, where∣fore he sent them, which are (as I haue shewed) two. First, to acquaint the Colossian with his owne state par∣ticularly, and with the state of things where he was gene∣rally, as he saith verse 7. (shall declare vnto you my whole state)
And verse 9. (They shall shew you of all things heere.) Secondly, that he might be made acquainted with their state, and that they might receiue comfort by his messen∣gers, sent vnto them, and especiallie by Tychicus, whom he saith verse 8. that hee sent to them for the same pur∣pose. Touching the wordes, some thinges are to be cleared, that wee may better proceede in the matter of doctrine verse 7. (shall declare vnto you my whole state) the Apo∣stle by his whole state,Interpre∣tation. meant all those thinges that were done to him, and befell him in prison, for so the wordes do signifie, things done about mee, or done to mee, the Apostle would haue the Colossians vnderstand, what was done to him, and how hee was dealt withall being in pri∣son, then he saith verse 9. they shall shew you of all things heere, by all thinges, he meant not all thinges in generall, whatsoeuer were done at Rome, for there was (no doubt) a multitude of things done, a world of things done in that Citie, but all thinges concerning the state of the Church, and the case of Christian faith, and profession, the knowledge whereof was profitable for the Colossians to know. And where hee saith verse 8. that he sent to them for the same purpose, that he might know their state, his mea∣ning is, that he might vnderstand the state of their church and how it stood with them in regard of Christian profes∣sion, how the Gospell prospered, and was glorified among them, or otherwise how they were molested, and troubled for the Gospell, heads (and might comfort your hearts) (that is) might encourage you, and cheere vp your harts, happily grieuing, and fainting for my imprisonment, or persecution of the Church, that he might hearten, and strengthen you against imminent dangers, and against the scandall, and offence of the crosse; thus then we are to conceiue the Apostles meaning, in respect of the ends wherefore he sent messengers to Colosse, as if he had said.
I haue sent to you two worthy Messengers, Tychicus and Onesimus to these ends, and pur∣poses, that they may report to you how I am dealt withall, and all things that are done to mee in my imprisonment, together with all things that concerne the state of the Church here at Rome, and may relate, and make report to mee backe againe, how it stands with you, how the Gospell doth prosper, and is glorified among you, or o∣therwise, how you suffer for the Gospels sake, and that they might bee meanes to cheere vp your hearts, that you faint not at my trouble, and might strengthen you against troubles that are like to fall vpon you, and against the offence and scandall of the crosse. I might hence (as iust occasion is giuen) speake of the Apostles singular care that he had ouer the Colossians, who being himselfe in prison which could not but giue him much occasion of care for himselfe, yet ceased not, to care for them, and in care of their good, not onely to write, but to send such worthy messengers vnto them, and that for so good ends, yea such men as himselfe (no doubt) had neede of to minister to him in prison, and so, for their good, to neglect (as it were, his owne life, and health, which was an exceeding measure of care, and it ought to be imitated of all that will approue themselues faithfull and carefull ministers in the like case, but vppon that I will not stand. In that the Apostle sent, forth his messengers to these ends, to acquaint the Colossians with his owne state, and with the state of the Church where he was, and to vnder∣stand of their state, he doth plainely manifest a desire that was in him to know the state of the Colossians, and that they also were desirous to heare and know his state, and the state of the whole Church where he was, and that they did euen long to heare one from another, whence we are
giuen to vnderstand thus much in generall. That particular Churches may bee desirous to know  the estate one of another, one particular Church may de∣sire to heare newes from another, yea, particular persons and members of the Church, may enquire after the e∣state of other Churches,Particular Churches may desire to know the e∣state one of another, and particular per∣sons may en∣quire after the estate of other Churches. Nehem 1.2. Reason. yea, of speciall members, and speciall instruments of Gods glory, in other Churches. Wee haue heere example of it, and elsewhere in other Epistles of Paul, and wee haue a notable example of it in Nehemiah: Nehemiah enquired after the state of the Iewes and concerning Ierusalem, and there is reason for this. Because (indeed) the Lords dealing with his Church, is not only a part of his reuealed wil, but it is a thing of spe∣ciall note and obseruation, and therefore may be enqui∣red after and knowen. And so it is lawfull for vs,  to desire newes from other Churches, touching such as are eminent members and speciall instruments of Gods glorie in those Churches, but withall know this, that it must not bee for nouelties sake,It is lawfull to desire to heare newes from other Chur∣ches, and tou∣ching such as be speciall in∣struments of Gods glory in them, if it bee not for nouel∣ties sake. it is an Heathenish thing to hearken after newes for no∣uelties sake, as the Athenians are noted to haue done, Act. 17.21. who gaue themselues either to tell, or to heare some newes, and manie of vs may iustlie bee taxed also for so doing, wee may lawfully desire to heare newes, but our listening after newes from other Churches, must bee to other good ends and purposes, as namely, that wee may praise God for their good estate, or that we may reach foorth our helping hands to them, either by prayer,The principall causes why we should de∣sire to heare newes from other Chur∣ches. or otherwise, as occasion and necessitie shall require, these (indeed) are the principall, and almost the onely causes why wee should bee desirous to heare newes from other Churches, and if wee listen after newes to these ends, it is a testimonie of our communion with them, and that wee are members of the same bodie with them, and haue a fellow-feeling, both of their good, and of their trou∣bles.
Now more specially, in that the Apostle saith, verse 7. That Tychicus should declare to the Colossians his whole state, how he was dealt withall, and all things that befell him in his imprisonment, this being one end, wherefore he sent his messengers, and he sending those messengers, out of his singular loue, and care that he had of the good of the Colossians we must needs conceiue thus much. That it was goood for the Colossians to know the state of the Apostle then in prison, and hence wee may gather this point of instruction. That it is good for vs euer to know the state of Gods children, that are in prison, or that lye vnder any other pressure, or trouble whatsoeuer, it is good for vs to be ac∣quainted with the state of Gods children suffering eyther imprisonment, or any other kind of trouble or affliction,It is good for vs to be ac∣quainted with the state of Gods children that be in pri∣son, or in any other trouble or affliction. it is good for vs to know, and consider how they are dealt withall, what things come vnto them, how they behaue and carry themselues in their troubles and what issue they haue out of them, what end the Lord makes, as Iames saith Iam. 5.11. ye haue heard of the patience of Iob, and haue knowne what end the Lord made, so it is good for vs to know, yea to marke, and obserue the things that befall Gods children in their sufferings, and what end the Lord makes of them, and not onely to know and consider the things that befel the Church and children of God in for∣mer ages, set before vs in the Scripture for examples to looke vpon, but to know and consider the things that are now done to Gods children in time of their troubles, and how they demeane themselues, and what issue they haue out of them, for therein wee shall many times see Gods great mercy and his wonderfull power manifestly appea∣ring, and therein we shall see the malice and fury of Satan, and of the world against Gods children, and how maruel∣lous the Lord is in his Saints, how he many times re∣straines the malice and power of their enemies, how hee supports and holds vp his children, how hee armes them
with patience, and how he is present by the vnspeak∣able comfort of his spirit, when they are most weake, and giues them issue out of their troubles when all hope seemes to be gone, and therefore doubtlesse it is good for vs to know and consider the state of Gods children in time of their imprisonment or any other suffering whatsoeuer, it is good for vs to mark and obserue it, and to be acquain∣ted with it. To what purpose may some say?Quet. Euen to this purpose,  both to teach vs how to carry our selues, Psal. 32.6. and to arme and strengthen vs,  and to make vs better able to endure the like triall, yea,The great good that comes vnto vs by our know∣ledge and due consideration of the state of Gods chil∣dren in time of their trou∣bles and affli∣ctions disco∣uered. the know¦ledge and due consideration of the state of Gods children in time of their pressures and afflictions, and how they are dealt withall, how they carrie themselues, what comfort they finde, and what end the Lord makes of their trials is of excellent vse, to put off, and to make voyd a notorious shift that Satan vseth sometimes against the weake Chri∣stian, as when a weake Christian is pressed with some great affliction, and some to comfort him, and cheere him vp, happily put him in minde of Ioseph, of Dauid, of Iob, and such like, and wish him to consider what end the Lord made of their trials, Satan is readie to suggest to the weake Christian, alasse, what tell you me of Ioseph, Dauid or Iob? what am I to be compared to them? they were men of excellent gifts, & endued with a great measure of strength their examples is not to be vsed and applied to me, which indeed is false, for as Iames saith of Elias, Iam. 5.17. they were subiect to like passions that wee are, they had their infirmities as other men haue, and they are set foorth as examples of comfort, to the weakest of Gods children, but if a weake Christian through the subtilty of Satan, and his owne weakenesse, bee not able to finde com∣fort in consideration of these examples, yet if hee can call to minde, that hee knew in his owne time a childe of God, as weake as himselfe, lying vnder some
great affliction, and hee was acquainted with his whole state in his affliction, and how the Lord vouchsafed com∣fort vnto him, and made a good end of his trouble, hee shall finde that that will bee of excellent vse to repell and quench the fiery darts of Satan, and that will be a nota∣ble meanes to strengthen and to hold him vp, and to giue him assurance, that the Lord will likewise restraine the malice of Satan against him, and giue him patience in his affliction, and will make such an end of it, as shall be most for his owne glory, and his comfort; doe thou therefore acquaint thy selfe with the state of Gods children, suffe∣ring either imprisonment or any other trouble, (thou canst not want examples) consider, obserue, and marke them, how they are dealt withall, how they behaue them∣selues, what end the Lord makes of their trouble, and thou shalt finde it will be a notable meanes to strengthen thee in time of like tryall, and if thou in time of thy affliction canst call to minde, and bee able to say, I know a childe of God, that was afflicted as I am, I remember his whole state, how hee was dealt withall, and what end the Lord made of his trouble, no doubt, thou shalt finde, that this conclusion of comfort will follow. Therefore I make no question, but that the Lord will be likewise good vnto me, and giue me such issue out of my trouble, as shall be most for his owne glory, and my good; Let euery childe of God therefore, labour not onely to arme himselfe with comforts and examples of Scripture, (though with those chiefly) but with examples also of his owne age and time, and thou shalt finde, that in time of need, thou shalt ther∣by haue stronger consolation and comfort. Now further whereas the Apostle saith, he sent his mes∣sengers to the Colossians, to know their state, and to shew them all things where hee was, meaning this, to know the state of their Church, how it stood with them in respect of christian profession, and things that did concerne the state of religion where hee was, wee may easily conceiue thus much.
That in our listning and enquiring after the state of o∣ther  Churches, wee are chiefly to inquire how it stands with them in respect of religion,We are chief∣ly to inquire how it stands with other churches, and with our freinds absent in respect of religion. how it fares with the gos∣pell among them, and how the professors of it are dealt withall; yea in our enquiring after the state of our parti∣cular freinds absent from vs, wee are chiefly to listen and looke after their spirituall state. It is an vsuall thing, for men in token of their loue, to in∣quire after the health, the wealth,  the frugalitie of their freinds absent, and far from them,Reproofe of them that chiefly inquire after other things. which (indeed) is not to be disallowed, it is both lawfull and commendable: the Philippians inquired after the health of Epaphroditus, cap: 2.26. after he had been sicke, and now recouered, the A∣postle sent him to them that they might see him, and re∣ioyce for his recouery; But we are especially to listen af∣ter them, and desire to know how it stands with them in respect of religion, how they profit and increase in faith, in loue, in repentance, in humilitie, and in other gifts and graces of Gods spirit, that is the thing wee are chiefly to inquire after: and let it suffice to haue named this point. The Apostle addes further, that hee sent Tychicus to the Colossians, that hee might comfort them, that hee might bee a meanes to cheere vp their hearts, that they should not faint at his troubles. Whence wee are taught. That it is a principall duty to bee performed by them  that are sent as Tychicus was, to others, to comfort them to whom they are sent, that they faint not, and that they be not ouercome of affliction: yea it is one speciall end to be diuen at by all such as are sent forth from the Lord to his people, euen by all the Ministers of the gospell, they are in their speeches and ministeriall actions, chiefly to ayme at this, that mens hearts may be comforted, that such as belong to God may receiue spirituall ioy and comfort,The ministers of the gospell are chiefly to intend in their speeches and miniterill actions, the spirituall ioy and comfort of such as be∣long to God. and may be furnished with such comfort, as that they may be able to stand without fainting in time of any affliction,
that is either vpon themselues or others. For (indeed) for that end, haue they knowledge of the secrets of the gospell giuen them, and the word of the gos∣pell put into their mouthes, which is the word of glad ty∣dings and heauenly comfort: and the end of the prea∣ching of it, is to bring Gods elect to certaine hope of sal∣uation, and as many as are begotten by that liuely hope, are also brought to reioyce with ioy vnspeakable and glo∣riou, 1. Pet: 1.8. this point I haue handled before, there∣foe I now only touch it. It may serue to checke and reprooue many Ministers of the gospell, who in their speeches and other ministeriall actions, ayme not at the comfort and edification of those, to whom they are sent, but at their owne profit; but chief∣ly it discouers the wickednesse of popish teachers,Many mini∣sters of the gospell iustly reprooud, but especially the wickednes of popish teachers dis∣couered. who turne their speeches and their teaching to a cleane con∣trary end, euen to hold men in continuall feare and doubt, and so in stead of comfort they fill them full of discom∣fort, and dispaire in time of great affliction, any man may see that that is to crosse the ordinance of God, and to pro∣phane the holy word of comfort. Wee are further to marke, that the Apostle saith not, and might comfort you, but, comfort your harts. Hence we are taught, That comfort of heart, true and sound comfort, that comforteth the hearts of men, is ordinarily deliuered by the Ministers of the gospell out of the word of God,True & sound comfort of heart is ordi∣narily deliue∣red by the ministers of the gsell out of the word of God. I say (ordinarily,) for extraordinarily it may be deliuered by priuate persons. Iob 33. vers: 19. we finde that when a man is stricken with sorrow on his bed, and findes no comfort, yet if there be with him a faithfull messenger of the Lord, one of a thousand, if hee declare vnto him his righteousnesse, and minister comfort to him faithfully, out of the word of God, that will comfort him, and cheere him vp, and make him see the face of the Lord with ioy, vers. 26. and the reason and ground of this is,
Because (indeede) the Lord that formed the lips hath vndertaken to giue a blessing to the word of comfort de∣liuered by his faithfull Minister, Isai. 57.19.  I create the fruits of the lips to be peace. Peace vnto them that are farre of, and to them that are neere (saith the Lord. Peace (that is) true, perpetuall, and constant comfort, vnto them that are farre of, and to them that are neere. Oh then,  what account ought we to make of the com∣forts of the word, made knowne to vs by the ministry of faithfull Ministers?Speciall ac∣count to bee made of the comforts of the word, de∣liuered by the ministrie of faithfull Mini∣sters. How ought we to treasure, and store it vp in our hearts? Worldly wisdome teacheth men to prouide against a storme, and a rainy day (as wee vse to speake) that they may haue some thing to comfort their bodies in time of neede; oh then bee thou wise, prouide some comfort for thy soule against the time of distresse, and affliction, and remember that thou canst not ordina∣rily haue true comfort, vnlesse it be deliuered by the mi∣nistrie of the Gospell, out of the word of God, and the comforts that faithfull Ministers deliuer out of the word, are cordiall indeed, they are such as will stand by thee, and cheere vp thine heart, when all the comforts in the world, faile thee, thou maiest obserue in that, sometimes it comes to passe, that a man that hath had no care to prouide such comfort, when the Lord lets loose the cord of his con∣science, and (happily) now hee lieth on his death bed, though he would giue all the world, (if it were his) for the least dramme of sound comfort, yet hee cannot haue it, therefore bee thou wise, now make precious account of the comforts deliuered to thee in the ministry of the word, hide them and treasure them vp in thine heart, that in time of neede they may comfort thee, and thou maiest finde the sweetnesse and comfort of them in thy greatest af∣fliction.
VER. 10 Aristarcus my prison-fellow saluteth you, and Marcus Barnabas sisters sonne, (tou∣ching whom yee receiued commandements. If he come vnto you, receiue him.) 11 And Iesus which is called Iustus, which are of the circumcision. These onely are my worke-fellowes vnto the kingdome of God, which haue beene vnto my consolation. In this verse the Apostle comes to a second branch of his conclusion,The second branch of A∣postle conclu∣sion. (namely the declaration of the loue of o∣thers, that were with him towards the Colossians, made knowne both by their salutations, sent vnto them, and by their praiers for them, in the 10.11.12.13. and 14. verses. In the 10 and 11. verses wee haue three persons men∣tioned, that out of their loue sent salutations to the Colossians, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Iesus, and that the Apostle might incite and stirre vp the Colossians, to re∣gard the loue of these men, and to loue them againe, hee describes them, and sets them out after a double man∣ner. First, hee commends them by such titles as were pro∣per to them seuerally, as that Aristarcus was his prison-fel∣low, Marcus kinsman to Barnabas, his sisters sonne, and that hee was also a man touching whom they had recei∣ued commandements, that if hee came vnto them, they should receiue him, and Iesus, by his surname, that he was surnamed Iustus. Then the Apostle commends them all three together, by things common to them all. As First, by their descent from the Iewes, that they were al three of the race of the Iewes, (which are of the circum∣cision.)
Secondly, by their assisting of him, and working toge∣ther with him to the kingdome of God, which commen∣dation is further amplified by the word of restraint (onely) that they only were his workfellowes vnto the kingdome of God. And then, Thirdly, they are commended by the comfort which they yeelded to the Apostle, that being in part, an effect of their assistance of him to the kingdome of God, in the last words of verse 11. (wich haue beene vnto my consolation) and so we see the generall things contained in these two verses. Come we to speake of them seuerally,Interpre∣tation. and first of the 10. vers. (Aristarcus my prison-fellow saluteth you, and Mar∣cus, Barnabas sisters sonne.) Touching these two persons, who they were: the first of them we may read of, Act. 19.29. and Act. 20.4. and Act. 27.2. In those plaes we find that he was of Macedonia, a Thessalian, no doubt, descen∣ded of the Iewes, and being conuerted by Pauls preaching, he did accompany him in the most of his iourneies, hee was taken with him in the tumult at Ephesus, and after that hee accompanied him going into Asia, and was carried prisoner together with Paul to Rome, and therefore hee heere cals him his fellow-prisoner. The other heere named (Marcus) was (no doubt) that Iohn Marke, spoken of, Act. 12.12. who being taken in∣to the company of Paul, and Barnabas, ministred to them in their iourney till they came to Perga, a Citie in Pam∣philia, but then departed from them, and returned to Ie∣rusalem, Act. 13.13. by meanes of whose departure, there arose afterwrd a sharp difference between Paul & Barnabas insomuch as they parted company, and went asunder one from another, Act. 15.39. But after this, Marke repented him of his departure, and was reconciled to Paul; yea, hee became studious, and painefull in promoting the Gospel, and hee was with Paul being prisoner at Rome, and mini∣stred vnto him, as appeares both in this text, and Philem:
Epist. vers. 24 him the Apostle commends vnder the ti∣tle of Barnabas sisters sonne, (that is) nephew, or kins∣man to Barnabas, that worthy seruant of Christ, and hee further addes that touching him they had receiued com∣mandements, meaning that they had beene written to concerning him, and the tenour and effect of the com∣mandement, or writing was, that if he came they should receiue him (that is) that they should entertaine him kindly, and respectiuely, as a true and faithfull seruant of Christ, and the reason of that Commandement, or writing was, lest vpon his former fault, his refusing to goe with Paul, and Barnabas to the worke of the Lord, and there∣upon Pauls refusall to take him to his company, the Co∣lossians should thinke that Paul still carried an hard con∣ceit of him, and that hee was not worthy to bee recei∣ued. Thus then conceiue wee the meaning of the Apostle in the Apostle, in the words of this verse; as if hee had said. Aristarcus that hath gone through many brunts of trouble with mee, and now my fellow-prisoner, and Iohn Marke nephew to Barnabas, that worthy seruant of Christ. who (indeed) at one time pulld away his shoulder from the worke of the Lord, for which I was much offended, and after that refused to take him to my company, but hauing repented himselfe of his depar∣ture, and being reconciled vnto mee, I haue written to you concerning him, and tou∣ching him you haue reciued commande∣ments, that if he come to you, you should giue him kinde and respectiue entertaine∣ment. These two out of their loue, send salutalions, they louingly and friendly sa∣lute you.
Now heere obserue we in generall that these persons A∣ristarchus,  Marcus, and Iesus called Iustus, out of their loue, and in token of it, sent salutations to the Colossians, whence we haue warrant and ground for sending of salu∣tations. That sending of salutations, is not onely a matter of ciuilitie,Sending of salutations is not onely a matter of ci∣uility, but a duty of loue that one chri∣stian is to yeelde to ano∣ther, and it must proceede from loue. and good manners (as we call them) but a duty of loue required of Christians, and to be performed one to another, by word, or by writing, we haue example of it not only heere but in other places also Rom. 16. al∣most throughout the whole chapter, 1. Cor. 16.19.20. 2. Cor. 13.12. wee finde it required by expresse precept, greete ye one another with an holy kisse, and therefore sending of greeting one to another, is not onely a matter of common curtesie, but a duty to be performed for con∣science sake, to expresse that loue and good affection that we beare one to another, for the Lord who hath appointed it to be a token of loue, would haue it to proceede from loue, and therfore whom we are forbidden to loue in their euill waies we are forbidden to salute, 2. Ioh. 10. verse. If there come any vnto you and bring not this doctrine, receiue him not to house, neither bidde him god-speede. Wee must then looke with what affection we salute one another, our salu∣ting and greeting one another must bee a testimonie and token of our heartie, and vnfained loue to those which we salute. No doubt we will easily yeeld that to salute one ano∣ther is our dutie, and we so doe, as occasion is offered,Reproofe of those who yeelde to o∣thers only a verball and complemen∣tall salutation. but is thy saluting of an other at all times a fruite of thy true loue to them whom thou salutest? I feare me it is not so in some, they salute others, and seeme kindly and friendly to greete them, but their salutation is many times, (as we vse to say) but from the teeth outward, it comes not from any true loue of the heart, especially if there haue beene a difference, or iarre betweene them and those whom they salute, or they haue conceiued some dislike of them, then their salutation is but as the couetous misers wel∣come,
Prouerb. 23.7. as though he thought it in his heart, he saith to his guest, eate and drinke, but his heart is not with him, so they salute others with whom they liue, and (happily) aske them how they do, but it is like Ioabs salu∣ting of Amasa, 2. Sam. 20.9. they carrie within a wicked purpose, and mischieuous heart against them, yea some thinke it sufficient if they yeeld a verball greeting of those with whom they liue, and sticke not to say, I giue him or her the time of the day, when I meete them, I aske them how they do, and what would you haue more, yes, there is more required of thee, thy saluting of others must pro∣ceede from a true loue of them, it must be a fruite ishuing out of that loue, and to that end consider thus much. That counterfet loue to men discouers fai∣ned and counterfet loue to God.Motiues to stirre vs vp to salute others heartily. For the first table of the commandements is fulfil∣led in the second, and the duties of the se∣cond, are plaine euidences of the duties of the first, and he that saith he loues God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for how can he that loueth not his brother whom hee hath seene, loue God whom he hath not seene, 1. Ioh. 4.20. Againe, counterfet loue to men discouers a corrupt heart, an heart not sanctified by the word, and spirit of God, 1. Pet. 1.22. seeing your soules are purified in obey∣ing the truth through the Spirit to loue brotherly without faining, loue one another with a pure heart feruently. If then thou wouldest be loath to dissemble with God, and if thou wouldest not discouer that thou art yet in the dregs of nature, and not sanctified by the word and spirit of God, then let thy heart and tongue euer go together in thy saluting of others, take heede of formall saluting of any: Let thy saluting and greeting of others euer proceed from inward affection and be an euidence and testimonie of thy vnfained loue to those whom thou salutest.
In the next place we are more speciallie to marke, that the Apostle to prouoke the Colossians to loue, and honor Aristarcus, as he out of his loue saluted them, describes him by his imprisonment with himselfe, that he had gone thorow many troubles, and now was his prison fellow, whence we may note thus much. That the constant suffering of men, and namely the  imprisonment which they suffer or haue suffered for the truth should be a speciall reason to mooue vs to loue and to honor them,The constant suffering of men and their imprisonment ought to moue vs to loue and to honor them aboue other professors. yea to honor them aboue other men, yea aboue other professors of the Gospell, we finde that the A∣postle thus set foorth Andronicus and Iunia his Cosens Rom. 16.7. And Epaphras Philem. Epist. vers. 23. and in∣deed ought we not exceedingly to loue, and in loue to ho∣nor, and respect them, who being free, are content to be∣come bound for the Gospell sake, and are most faithfull, and fast to Gods truth, and ought wee not exceedingly to honor those whom the God of glory hath so highly ho∣nored, as to chuse them out from among the common sort of soldiers, to be as it were his champions to stand out in the defence of his truth, against all gainesaiers? cer∣tainely we ought. And therefore take heede thy thoughts be not like the thoughts of the world, do not thou thinke they are fooles,  and silly fellowes, men of no reach nor wit, that suffer re∣straint of their liberty by imprisonment, for the truth of God;We are not to thinke as the world doth touching those that are imprisoned for the truth of God. as the world, and as carnall minded men thinke of them, but remember the words of the Apostle Phil. 1.29. To you it is giuen for Christ, that not onely ye should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake. The Apostle would haue vs to know that it is a speciall fauour which none attaine to, but they to whom it is gi∣uen and granted by speciall priuiledge from the Lord, and that it is a speciall honour vouchsafed to some, to suffer for the truth of God, and thou art to discerne that honor and to see it shining through the thicke cloud of their suf∣ferings,
and thou art to honor, and to esteeme them the more, whom the Lord hath so honored, otherwise thou lookest not on them with a right eie, and thy heart is not right within thee. Obserue further in that the Apostle calles Aristarchus his prison fellow we may easily, and we must needes con∣ceiue, that the Apostle had a companion, and fellow, one that did partake with him in his suffering, and did suffer the same things with him, and hence wee may raise this point of doctrine. That the same afflictions befall diuers of the children of God,The same af∣flictions befall diuers of Gods chil∣dren. that which one of Gods children suffers, another, yea it may be many others suffer the like, the cup of affli∣ction in any kinde, is not tempered, and appropriated to one childe of God alone, but it is made ready for many of them, as the father himselfe shall iudge fit, and many of Gods children drinke of the same cuppe of affliction, no childe of God is singular in his suffering, but he may finde out a fellow sufferer, if he looke abroad into the world, and into the state of Gods children in former times. Gen. 26.1. The text saith there was a famine in the land besides the first famine that was in the daies of Abraham, plainely shewing, that the Lord tried Izhak with the same affliction of famine, that he had tried Abraham his father withall. Heb. 11.36. The holy Ghost saith others haue beene tried by mockings, and scourgings, yea moreouer by bonds & imprisonments, giuing vs to vnderstand, that howsoeuer the Saints suffered some one kinde of afflicti∣on, and some another, yet no kinde of affliction was laide on any one alone, but others were fellow sufferers with him, and endured the like, we see it then a cleare point. That no triall or affliction befals one childe of God a∣lone, but others also with him, he hath fellow sufferers. And this (for the vse) may serue as a ground of great comfort to a childe of God in time of some grieuous af∣fliction,Comfort to Gods children in time of their grieuous af∣flictions. as the common saying is, it is a comfort to such
as be in miserie to haue a companion in their suffering. And (indeed) there is matter of comfort to a childe of God in time of his affliction in this, that no other burden is laid on him then was before, or (happily) now is borne by other of Gods children, and that he may (if he will) finde out a fellow-sufferer one that is like to himselfe in suffering, in time of great affliction, Sathan will be busie with a weake Christian, and go about to perswade him, and to fasten it vpon him, that neuer any but he tooke vp that crosse, or at least, was afflicted as he is, and sometimes he doth worke that persuasion into the hearts of some that are weake, and they sticke not to vtter it, and to crie out, as the Church did, Lamen. 1.12. was there euer any sorrow like vnto my sorrow which is done vnto me wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce wrath: Oh neuer man nor woman suffered as I suffer, neuer any felt and endured that which I feele, and endure. Thou art deceiued whosoeuer thou art, this is but out of thy weake∣nesse, it is not so, if thou be a childe of God know it for a certaine truth, what thou doest abide, others of Gods children in like sort haue abiden, and thy suffering, and measure of affliction, is no more a token of Gods displea∣sure to thee then this was to them, but both to thee, and them it is his messenger in loue, for the exercise of thy faith, the triall of thy patience, or some other good end, the Apostle Peter speakes plaine to this purpose 1. Pet. 5.9. Resist the (deuill) stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren, which are in the world. If then Sathan be busie with thee in time of thy affliction, and tell thee thou art an odde person, and thou differest from all Gods children in thy suffering, and that the Lord neuer dealt so with any of his children, tell him he is a liar as he hath beene. The Apostle whom thou oughtest to beleeue hath taught thee another lesson, that the same afflictions are accomplished in thy brethren, which are in thee, although thou know them not, and
therefore thou art no odde person, thou differest not from all Gods children in thy suffering, euer remember it in time of thy grieuous affliction, that no other triall, or af∣fliction, is vpon thee, then hath beene, or now is endured by other of Gods children, and thou art no otherwise chastised then with that rod that hath beene laide on their backes, whose saluation is sure, and thou shalt finde it will be a notable comfort to thee. We are further to obserue that the Apostle describing Marcus, and commending him to the Colossians, he sets him out by his kindred, that he was Barnabas sisters son, that he was kinsman to Barnabas, that worthy seruant of the Lord, and in that respect to be esteemed, hence wee may easily gather thus much. That it is no small honor to be kinsman to one that is a worthy seruant of God, it is a matter of dignity to be allied and to be of the kindred of such as are godly and excel∣lent instruments of gods glory.It is a matter of honor and dignitie to be of the kindred of such as are godly and worthy in∣struments of Gods glory. And hence it is that the Apostle not only heere, but else∣where remembers this title of honor, as Rom. 16.7. An∣dronicus nnd Iunia my Cosins, verse, 11. Herodian my kins∣man verse 21. Lucius, and Iason, and Sosipater my Kinsmen whereby the holy ghost would teach vs to esteeme it as an excellent honor to be of the kindred to a godly man, see then by this briefly, the great force of true pietie and the accoumpt it is of with the Lord, it is sufficient not only to get honor to those that haue it with all that are able to iudge aright, but also to all their kindred, and such as bee  of the kindred to good and godly men, may reioyce in this,True piety is not onely an honour to those that haue it, but it brings ho∣nour also to all their kin∣dred. and after an holy manner euen boast in it, that they haue worthy seruants of God to their kinsmen, and much more to their parents, that they are the children of godly parents, yet so as that by their example they be stirred vp to the like godlinesse, else that honor will turne into their shame, both before God, and men, for as Salomon saith of age Prouerb. 16.31. Age is a crowne of glorie when it is found in
the way of righteousnesse. So to bee kinsman to some worthy seruant of God, or descended of godly Parents, is a crowne of glory, if it bee set on the head of one that is godly & religious himselfe, else it is rather a dishonour vnto him, and without Gods mercy, it shall encrease his condemnation. Again, is it an honor to be of the kindred to holy men  and worthy seruants of God? then much greater honour is it to be brother to the son of God himselfe, the Lord Iesus & the adopted son or daughter of God the father, in him,It is the grea¦test honour that can be, to be brother to the Lord Ie∣sus, and the a∣dopted sonne or daughter of God his fa∣ther, in and thorow him. that is the highest degree of honour that can bee vouchsa∣fed to any; worldly men esteeme it great honour to bee of the kindred of noblemen, and great men in the world, but alasse, it is but a shadow, or rather not so much as a shadow, compared to the true honour of the least of Gods Saints, to be brethren to Christ, and the adopted sonnes and daughters of God, and therefore let thy heart be affe∣cted with that honour, and be thou euen ambitious, in seeking after tbat aboue all things in the world. The Apostle further affirmes that touching Marcus, the Colossians had receiued commandements, that if he came vnto them, they should receiue him, they had been written vnto concerning him, they had receiued letters (no doubt of commendation touching him, and letters giuing order and charge to them, and commanding them in the Lord, as the Apostle saith Philem. 8. verse, though I be very bold in Christ, to command thee that which is conuenient, so they had receiued letters (it may be) from the Apostle, by vertue of his Apostleshippe, commanding them, if Marcus, now a true and faithfull seruant of Christ came vnto them, they should giue him kinde and respe∣ctiue entertainement: See then in the Apostle an excel∣lent example of Christian behauiour, toward such as ha∣uing formerly offended, are now truely humbled for their offence, and shew foorth euident signes of their repen∣tance for the same. Though Iohn Marke had made de∣fection
not from Christ and Christian faith, but from the labour and worke of it, from going with Paul and Barna¦bas to the worke of the Lord, and therefore greeuously offended, yet now hauing repented himselfe of his sinne, and testified his repentance by his sincere care to promote the Gospell of Christ, the Apostle did put cleane out of his minde, his former offence, and esteemed him as a true and faithfull seruant of Christ, and did commend him to the Church by his letters, he writ letters of commendati∣on on his behalfe, yea (as it may seeme) he vsed his Apo∣stolicall power, in charging them to whom he writ, that if Iohn Mark came vnto them, they should receiue him, we see then no former offences should bee remembred after the heart is truely touched for them, and repentance made knowen by infallible tokens, this poynt wee lately stood on. I will now onely adde thus much. That no former offence to vs in particular should bee thought vpon, after the partie offending, hath been hum∣bled, and hath made knowen his repentance, and we are mutually reconciled, after mutual reconciliation between parties that haue beene at difference, all former offences ought to bee cleane forgotten, as though they had neuer beene, yea, there ought to bee a commending of good things in the party that hath offended vs, and a dooing good to him, as occasion is offered.After mutuall reconciliation between par∣ties that haue beene at diffe∣rence, all for∣mer offences ought to bee cleane forgotten, & there ought to be a doing good one to another, as occasion is offered. And therefore doe not thou say as commonly men vse to say, I will forgiue him, and I will be friends with him, but I will neither meddle nor make with him, I will nei∣ther buy nor sell with him, I will haue nothing to do with him,  it shall bee betweene vs as it was betwixt the Iewes and Samaritans Ioh. 4.9. if it be so,A common saying a∣mongst men iustly taxed. there is no sound re∣conciliation; Vpon sound and true reconciliation, there must follow a speaking, and a writing for the good of the partie that hath offended vs, yea, a doing good to him, as occasion shall bee offered, if that follow not, certainely,
there is no sound reconciliation, no reconciliation plea∣sing to God, and comfortable to thine owne soule. Now further in that the Apostle saith, that touching Iohn Marke, the Colossians had receiued commande∣ments, or letters of commendation, and had beene writ∣ten vnto in his behalfe: we may see. That letters commendatory may lawfully be giuen vn∣to  men,Letters▪ of commendati∣on may law∣fully be giuen to men. certificates and testimonies in writing, touching the vertue, and good life, and conuersation of men, for their better entertainment in strange places may lawfully be granted. Wee find that the Apostle thus yeelded commendati∣ons to Phoebe in his epistle Rom. 16.1. I commend vnto you Phoebe our sister, an it was an ancient custome in the primitiue Church, to giue to some both professours and Preachers of the Gospell, letters of commendation, as we may gather, 1. Cor. 16.3. 2. Cor. 3.1. which (indeede) the Apostle there saith, he needed not to, or from the Co∣rinthians, because their conuersion was his letter of com∣mendation, need wee (saith hee) as some other, Epistles of recommendation, vnto you or letters of recommenda∣tion from you, verse 2. yee are our Epistle written in our hearts, which is vnderstood and read of all, yet thereby he shewes it was the manner of the Church, to giue letters of recommendation to some in those times: and so it is still lawfull for the Church, and Gouernours of it, to giue and grant letters of recommendation to some in these dayes, if so be they be carefull to certifie nothing but the truth, & to commend none but such as are worthy to be commended,How and to whom letters of commen∣dation may be giuen. it is a grosse abuse that hath crept into the Church, that many rouers and wanderers, who haue been spued out of some place for some enormious sinne, they come to other places where they are not knowen, bring∣ing with them, letters of large commendation, they bring many goodly vertues written down in their papers, when notwithstanding a man may see many foule vices aboun∣ding
in their liues. It is a foule abuse to grant letters of commendation to such,The giuing of letters com∣  it doth much hurt in the Church, especially if the persons so commended bee in the ministry, then they
giuen him for the notable vprightnesse, and iust dealing vsed by him. It may bee will some say,  the Greeke word hath no such signification. indeede▪  but we must know that the
name vnder heauen, whereby we must be saued. And therefore now the name (Iesus) may not be giuen to any childe, at his baptisme: and indeed, it is a presump∣tuous,The Ieuites justly taxed for their bold presumption in taking to themselues the name of Iesuites. and bold part, of that pestilent brood of the Iesu∣ites, to take to themselues, the name and title of Iesuites: that being a name, and title deriued from the name (Iesus) the proper name of our Lord Christ, which ought not so much as by deriuation, to be put vpon any creature what∣soeuer.Obect. Happilie they will say, that we take to our selues, the name of Christians, which is a name deriued from Christ, and why then may not they take the name (Iesuite) deriued from the name Iesus. We haue expresse warrant for the one, in the worde of God: but not for the other. Act. 11.26. we finde the name (Christian) was giuen to the disciples at Antioch: not by the deuice of man, but by diuine oracle, as the word there vsed signifieth, but wee finde no warrant for the name, Iesuite, in the booke of God, and certainely, it is a monstrous boldnesse and presumption, to arrogate and assume that name, that being deriued from the most high and glorious name (Iesus) a name aboue euery name, Phil. 2.9. Names of speciall signi∣fication may now be giuen to children.But to make some vse of this to our selues: howsoeuer we may not now giue the name IESUS to any childe at his baptisme, yet as that name being a name of speciall sig∣nification, was giuen to some in time of the old Testa∣ment: so now may wee giue names to our children, that signifie and put vs in minde of good things: we may giue names to preserue the memory of something, to preserue the name and memory of parents, or kindred: especially if they haue been godly, and religious: or to reuiue the remembrance of the life and profession of good men, by renuing their names. The vse we are to make of our a mes giuen vs at our baptisme.And wee must know that though our names, that haue been giuen vs at our baptisme, be not of some speciall sig∣nification, yet they should put vs in minde of our new
birth: they were giuen at the sacrament of regeneration, and new birth, and whensoeuer they are recited, they should put vs in minde of that, and of that vow and pro∣mise we made to God at our baptisme, when thy name was imposed on thee, and registred in the roll of Christians, thou didst promise in the sight of God, of his Angels, and of his people, to forsake the deuill and all his works: and whensoeuer thy name is repeated, thou shouldst call to minde that vow, and endeuour to performe it: and if thou doe not, surely, thy very name shall one day be a wit∣nesse against thee, and increase thy iudgment. Now further in that this Iesus was surnamed (Iustus) or Iust: in that he had gotten such an honorable title among the Romanes, as to be called Iustus, and thorow his nota∣ble vpright and iust dealing amongst them, it teacheth vs thus much. That the Lord vouchsafeth titles of honour euen in this  world to his children,The Lord vouchsafes titles of honor to his children euen in this world. such as are true beleeuers, and by their holy and righteous conuersation, seeke glory and honour: the Lord doth crowne them with honour, they haue many times excellent epithites, and titles of true ho∣nour giuen them, euen in this world. We may see it, not onely in this man, but in other examples also: wee finde that Abraham is called (faithfull Abraham) he hath that honorable title vouchsafed him by the Apostle, Galat: 3.9. and hee is knowne by it to all nations. Thus Noah was called a Preacher of righteousnesse, 2. Pet: 2.5. and Lot (iust Lot) the same chapter and 7. verse: and thus the children of God are vsually commended for some excel∣lent vertue in them: yea certainly, by what gift, grace,Note. or vertue soeuer the children of God and true beleeuers, doe most of all glorifie God, in the same doth the Lord com∣monly vouchsafe them honour, and cause them to bee re∣uerenced, and magnified, euen in this world. Thus Io∣seph for his wisdome, by which he much glorified god, was had in honour with Pharaoh, and the prophane Aegypti∣ans,
Gen. 41.38.39. Can we finde such a one as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is. And Pharaoh said vnto Ioseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so dis∣creet and wise as thou art. Thus Phinehas for his zeale in executing gods iudgments; was renowmed from genera∣tion to generation, Psal. 106.31. And on the contrary, wherein wicked men most of all dishonour God, therein commonly the Lord doth cause them to be branded with a note of infamie, euen in this world, as Ieroboam hath of∣ten that blacke marke set vpon him, Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat that made Israel to sinne, it became as a sirname to him. And Iudas is often branded with that foule blemish of treason, Iudas the traytor, or Iudas Iscariot, that betrayed Christ, and the reason and ground of this is. First, that speech of the Lord to old Elie, 1 Sam: 2.30. saith the Lord to him, they that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. The Lord will certainly honour them that honour him, and he will bring shame and disgrace on them that dishonour him. Againe, glory is an inseparable companion of goodnes: and shame of sinne, and therefore he that hath the one of them, cannot be without the other. Now then dost thou thirst after titles of honour? dost thou desire to haue honour and estimation euen in this present world?The right way to get honour and estimation in the world. no doubt thou dost, for (indeed) a good name and good estimation in this world, is much to bee desired, Prou: 22.1. it is to bee chosen aboue great riches, and aboue gold; why then seeke it not in fleshly courses, but in the loue of God, and of his word, in the loue of his truth, and in approouing thy selfe both to god and man, in well-doing, that is the way to get the title of ho∣nour. It will bee said that is the onely way to get scorne, and contempt in the world, doe you not see that those who make conscience of sinne, and haue care to please god, and to approoue their hearts and liues, to god and man, in
well-doing, they are counted as the basest, and as the off∣scowring of all things; they are pointed at with the fin∣ger, nick-named, and many waies abused. It is true (indeed,) but wee must know,  that it is not a good name and true honour, that is giuen by all men, or vpon all occasions, but then oney, when it is giuen for iust cause, and by such as are of sound iudgment, and haue their eyes opened by the spirit of god, to see and discerne, who are worthy to bee honoured. The wicked in the Scripture, are called fooles: now who will care what a foole or madde man saith of him? but let vs seeke to ap∣prooue our selues to the Lord in well-doing, and the Lord will crowne vs with honour and estimation amongst all good men, and that is (indeed) a good name, and true honour: yea if thou in vprightnesse of thine heart, labour to approoue thy selfe to God and man, in well-doing, as∣suredly howeuer in this wicked world, thou bee little ac∣counted of, (if it did not so account of thee it were not like to it selfe) yet thou shalt bee honoured in the hearts of all Gods children:Note. yea sometimes thou shalt be honoured in the conscience of some, whose tongues doe smite thee: and there∣fore if thou be one that dost striue to keep faith and good conscience, and to approoue thy selfe in well doing to god and man, bee stird vp and encouraged to doe it more, vn∣doubtedly the Lord will cause thy righteousnesse to shine as the light, Psal 37.6. it shall bee as cleare as the light, to the eyes of all that looke on thee, and shall shine brighter and brighter: thou shalt haue increase of honour, n this present world, and thou shalt finde, through Gods mercy euerlasting honour, and an eternall waight of glory be¦stowed vpon thee in the life to come. The Apostle hauing thus commended and set forth these three, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Iesus, by things pro∣per to them, seuerally: hee comes to commend and set them forth by things common to all three, ioyntly toge∣ther: as first,
Interpreta∣tion.That they were of the circumcision, (that is) of the race of the Iewes, naturally descended of the Iewes: for so are the Iewes, many times, expressed in the new Testament, vnder that name or title, Circumcision. Rom: 3.30. it is one God who shall iustifie circumcision of faith, (that is) the Iewes, as appeares vers: before; so Titus 1.10. There are many (saith the Apostle) disobedient, and vaine talkers, and decei∣uers of mindes, chiefly hey of the circumcision, (that is) the Iewes. Now in that the Apostle commended these three, Ari∣starcus, Marcus, and Iesus, being now conuerted to the faith, & being now beleeuing Christians, that they were of the linage and race of the Iewes, wee are giuen to vnder∣stand thus much. That it is so farre from being any disparagement or disgrace to true beleeuers, to bee descended of the race of the Iewes, as that (indeed) it is a matter of dignitie and honour to them: true beleeuing Iewes may truly chal∣lenge it as a matter of honour to them, that they descen∣ded of such ancestors,True belee∣uing Iewes may challenge it as an honor to them that they are des∣cended of such ancestors that they are come of them, who were a people, with whom the Lord made a speciall co∣uenant. For howsoeuer the body of that people generally, fell away by their vnbeleife: yet that lets not, but that the remnant of them which belieue, haue some kinde of pri∣uiledge aboue other people. The Apostle demaunding, Rom: 3.1. What is then the preferment of the Iew? or what is the profit of circumcision? hee answers himselfe in the se∣cond verse: much euery manner of way, for chiefly because vnto them were committed the Oracles of God: for what (saith he) though some did not beleeue, shall their vnbeliefe make the faith of God without effect? God forbid. The beleeuing gentiles are become sonnes of God together with the be∣leeuing Iewes: yet so as the Iewes, are (as it were) the first borne, and the elder brother of the two: the gentiles are not true branches of the Lords oliue, but such as of wilde
oliue branches are naturalized: whereas the Iewes were naturall branches: and to the Iewes was the gospell first preached by the commandement of Christ, Matth: 10 6. and from them it proceeded to the gentiles: and the A∣postle reckons vp many priuiledges of the Iewes, Ro: 9.4. that to them pertaines the adoption, and the glory, and the coue∣nants, and the giuing of the Law, and the seruice of God, and the promises. therefore (doubtlesse) it is a matter of honour to true beleeuing Iewes, that they are descended of such progenitors: and this must first teach vs. Not to hate the Iewes (as many doe) because they are  Iewes, but to hate their obstinacie, in reiecting Christ,The belee∣uing Iewes are not to bee hated, because they are Iewes, but they are the more to bee loued euen in that respect. and christian faith: but if they be true beleeuers, then to loue them the more, because they are Iewes: and seeing the Lord made such a speciall couenant with that people, and vouchsafed them such excellent prerogatiues, and that they are descended of the holy Patriarkes according to the flesh: in that respect, we are to loue them, though they bee yet vncalled, and to wish them well, and to pray for their calling, and for their conuersion. Againe, it is a matter of honour to the true beleeuing  Iew, to the Christian Iew, that hee is descended of such progenitors to whom many excellent prerogatiues did be∣long. We may see then, that descent from excellent and wor∣thy ancestors, and from such as haue many priuiledges ioined with true faith, is (indeed) a matter of honour and dignitie;To be descen¦ded of excel∣lent and wor∣thy ancestors, is an honour and dignitie, when it is ioi∣ned with true faith in Christ bare discent from such ancestors is no matter of honour at all, vnlesse it be ioined with true faith, but con∣curring, and meeting together with true faith in Christ, it is a matter of great honour, yea certainely, in whom there is true faith in Christ,Note. though the person beleeuing be not of the Iewes (which is our case) yet to him (as one saith well) all the nobility of Christ his auncestours according to the flesh, is communicated, to one that be∣leeues in Christ, be hee Iew, or Gentile, euen the Fathers
and ancestors of Christ, according to the flesh, are made his ancestors, and he is honourable in them. Abraham is his father, as the Apostle saith plainely, Gal. 3.7. They which are of faith, the same are the chil∣dren of Abraham, but one that beleeues not in Christ, though hee bee a Iew by naturall birth, yet he is not to be esteemed as a true childe of Abraham, as the Apostle likewise saith, Rom. 9.6. All are not Israell, which are of I∣sraell; and it is no matter of honour to such an one to be descended of the Iewes according to the flesh, and so in like case, admit it to bee true that our aduersaries, the Papists say, that their Pope, and their Bishops are succes∣sors of Peter, and of the Apostles, yet that personall suces∣sion is nothing worth,Personall suc∣cession is no∣thing worth without the truth of faith. that is no matter of honour, except they can shew some good euidence that they likewise suc∣ceed them in the true faith of Christ, which they are ne∣uer able to doe; indeed, personall succession is of some worth, and to be esteemed of, and we reuerently esteeme of it, if so bee true faith in Christ concurre and meete with it, but to vse the bare plea of antiquity, and of per∣sonall succession, without the truth of faith, is but a vaine bragge, and an emptie title without honour. Interpre∣tation.Come we to the second thing common to these three men, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Iesus, whereby the Apo∣stle commends them to the Colossians that these onely were his worke-fellowes vnto the kingdome of God; that word of restraint (onely) is to be vnderstood with limita∣tion to the Iewes, as if the Apostle had said these onely of the Iewes, or these onely among them of the circumcisi∣on, are my workefellowes (that is) ioine not onely their hearts, but their hands, euen all their force and abilities, with mee to the furtherance of Gods kingdome, and doe (indeed) with me, further, and helpe forward the king∣dome of God, the Apostle speakes in the time present they are my worke-fellowes, (vnto the kingdome of God) The Kingdome of God in Scripture, hath many accep∣tions,
I forbeare to speake of them, heere it signifies the Gospell, or the whole word of God, the doctrine of the Prophets, and Apostles, and especially, the doctrine of the Gospell. And that it may thus be expounded, we haue warrant for it, Act. 28.23, Where it is said, that Paul expounded to them that came vnto him, and testified the kingdome of God; then presently is added, by way of exposition, and preached vnto them concerning Iesus, taught them the doctrine of the Gospell. And againe, verse 31. Preaching the kingdome of God, and then followes, and teaching those things which concerne the Lord Iesus Christ. Whence it is cleare, that the Kingdome of God is sometimes put for doctrine of the Gospell, for (indeede) the doctrine of the Gospell is the Scepter of Gods king∣dome,Mar. 1.14. Isai. 1.4.53.1. and the speciall meanes whereby hee raigneth a∣mong vs, in which respect the Gospell is called the Gos∣pell of the kingdome, and the rod of his mouth, and the breath of his lips to slay the wicked, and the arme of the Lord. Thus then we are to conceiue these words, (these one∣lie are my worke-fellowes vnto the kingdome of God▪) as if the Apostle had said. These onely among the Iewes, ioine their hearts and hands, euen all their force, and abilities with me, to the furtherance of the Gospell, and doe (indeed) with me further, helpe forward, and promote the doctrine of the Gospell. Now, first in that the Apostle thus commended these three men, Aristarcus, Marke, and Iesus, that they were his worke-fellowes to the kingdome of God, in that hee gaue them this commendation, that they ioined hearts and hands together with him, in furthering and aduan∣cing the kingdome of God, in helping forward, and pro∣moting
the doctrine of the Gospell. We may easily gather thus much in generall. That it is an excellent and commendable thing, when men ioine together in the worke of the Lord, when men ioine their hearts, and hands, euen all their force, and abilities together, in aduancing the kingdome of God,It is an excel∣lent thing when men ioine their hearts and hands toge∣ther in aduan∣cing the king∣dome of God in helping forward, and promoting the doctrine of the Gospell, it is a matter most excellent and commenda∣ble. For why? We know that a combination, and associ∣ation, and ioining together of men, in any good worke, is an excellent thing, deseruing commendation, and the better the work is the greater commendation is it for men to ioine their hearts and hands together in the furthering of it. Now the aduancing of Gods kingdome, and promo∣ting the doctrine of the Gospell, is a most excellent worke, for that beeing aduanced, God is most glorified, and his name euery way most of all sanctified; therefore it must needes be a most excellent thing, when men ioine toge¦ther in helping forward, and furthering the doctrine of the Gospell; and specially when master-workemen, mini∣sters of the Gospell, ioine hearts and hands in that busi∣nesse: when they (as the Apostle saith) Gal. 2.9.) Giue the right hand of fellowship one to another, and ioine to∣gether as one man in aduancing Gods kingdome, when they ioine their studies, their labours, their learning, their vtterance, their teaching, their writing, and all their abili∣ties to the furtherance of the Gospell. That is an excellent thing indeed, and that is a speciall thing that we are to pray for,Wee are to pray that the ministers of the Gospell may ioine together as one man in aduancing Gods king∣dome. yea that is a speciall thing we doe pray for, if we pray aright when wee vse that petiti∣on, Let thy kingdome come. We are to pray to the Lord that the differences amongst the Ministers of the Gospell may bee compounded, and that they may ioine hearts and hands and all their forces together, for the aduancement
of Gods kingdome, and for the beating down of the king∣dome of sinne, Satan, and Antichrist, that they may ioine together as one man against the enemie of our saluation, and against all the aduersaries of our comfort. Againe, is it an excellent thing when men ioine hearts  and hands together, for the aduancement of Gods king∣dome, and furtherance of the Gospell? Surely then, wee must needes conceiue on the contrarie, that it is a vile and discommendable thing for men, to ioine hearts and hands together, to hinder the doctrine of the Gospell,A vile and dis∣commēdable thing it is, when men ioine hands and hearts together to hinder the doctrine of the Gospell. that is a fearefull high degree of sinne, that is to be work-fellowes, not to the kingdome of God, but to the Kingdome of the Deuill: Dost thou ioine hands with othets, to hinder the doctrine of the Gospell? Dost thou together with others oppose the spreading of the Gospell, and course of good things? A thing too common in the world, if the grace of the Gospel do but peere out, & begin to appeare in any, presently men band themselues against it, they discoun∣tenance it, and they ioine all their force and strength a∣gainst it? dost thou, I say, ioine hand with such persons? Surely then, thou makest thy selfe guilty of a fearefull and high degree of sinne, and thou prouokest the Lord to hea∣uie wrath against thee: consider that place 1 Thess. 2.16. The Apostle there saieth that the Iewes in hindering the course and spreading of the Gospell to the Gentiles, fild vp the measure of their sinne, and it was a token that the wrath of God was come on them to the vtmost; woul∣dest not thou then fill vp the measure of thy sinne, and make it euen ripe and ready for iudgement? Wouldest thou not seale it vp to the terrour of thine owne soule, that Gods wrath is already ceased vpon thee, and that the Lord already sits in iudgement on thee? then be not thou a worke-fellow with those that openly hinder the course of the Gospell, and doe not thou ioine hands with them that oppose the grace of the Gospell, and good things, take thou heede of so foule a sinne.
Now more specially in the next place we are to mark, that the Apostle calles not these men his fellow-wellwi∣shers, or such as had onely as good a will to the furthe∣rance of the Gospell, as himselfe, but hee calles them his fellow-workers, he saith, they were such as did some thing together with him, to the aduancement of Gods king∣dome, and to the furtherance of the Gospell. Hence we may gather this conclusion. That it is not enough for vs to wish well together with others, to the kingdome of God, but wee must doe some thing together with them that labour that way,It is not in∣ough for vs to wish as wel as ohers to the urtherance of the Gspell, but we must doe some thing together with them that labour that way. wee must put our helping hands to that worke, we must ioine hands with them th tendeuour and labour to aduance the king∣dome of God, yea though we be but priuate persons, yet must we doe something together with the Minister, that may serue to helpe forward the kingdome of God, and may further the Gospell. This we finde that Aquila and Priscilla beeing tent-ma∣kers, and one of them a woman, yet were they the Apo∣stles felow-workers, so hee calles them, Rom, 16.3. The originall word is the same that is heere vsed, they laboured together with the Apostle: so againe, verse 9. of that Chapter, he calles Vrbanus his fellow-helper in Christ, and thus Marcus, Aristarcus, Demas, and Luke, his fellow-hel∣pers, Philem: Epist. vers. 24. To make vse of this; A man may heare sometimes ma∣ny amongst vs,Such as onely wish well to the doctrine of the Gospel nd yet helpe t not forward any thing at all, are repro∣ued. wishing that things were well, and saying, oh that men would yeeld to the Doctrine of the Gospell, and to the things they are taught in the publike ministrie of the word, then it were an happy thing, then all would bee well, but alas, few there bee that helpe forward any thing at all that way, few there bee that ioine hands with the Minister, to helpe forward the kingdome of God. And it may be, some thinke it is a matter not belong∣ing to them, to helpe forward the Doctrine of the Gospell, but that it pertaines onely to the Minister: indeed princi∣pally
it belong to him, but thou must know, it belongs to thee also, being a priuate person in thy place and cal∣ling, thou must within the compasse of thy calling,It belongs to priuate per∣sons within compasse of their callings to helpe for∣ward the do∣ctrine of the Gospel. bee a fellow-worker with the Minister to the aduancement of Gods kingdome, and promoting of the Doctrine of the Gospell. Alas, how shall I that am a poore man be a fellow-wor∣ker with the Minister, and helpe forward,  and promote the doctrine of the Gospell? Thou maiest be so many waies, by instruction,  by coun∣sell, by admonition, by consolation, by good example,In two things especially, may pruate perons helpe forward the doctrine of the Gospel. and the like; but especially by these two things. 1 First, by remembring the doctrine deliuered by the Minister, and conferring vpon that, and euen whetting that vpon thy children, seruants, friends, or neighbours, as the Lord commanded his people, Deut. 6.7. And thou shalt * rehearse (the word signifies to sharpen) them conti∣nually vnto thy children, and thou shalt talke of them when thou tarriest in thine house, and as thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp. 2 Secondly, by earnest and hearty praier to God for a free passage of the Gospell, 2. Thess. 3.1. Pray (saith the Apostle) that the word of the Lord may haue free passage, and be glorified euen as it is with you. These two waies, thou art especially to ioine hands with the Minister, and become a fellow worker with him, in the aduancement of Gods kingdome, and to further the aduancement of the Gospell.Two motiues to stir vp pri∣uate persons to helpe for∣ward the do∣ctrine of the Gospell. And to stirre thee vp to this duty, consider onely these two things. 1 First, where there is conscience of this dutie, expe∣rience shewe i, there is much profit by the publike mini∣strie of the word, and where this is neglected, there is lit∣tle or no good done by the most faithfull, and powerfull ministry of the word, the Minister may spend his heart out of his body, and doe little good, if he haue no worke-fel∣lowes
to helpe forward the doctrine of the Gospell. 2 Againe, consider that thou praiest to the Lord that his kingdome may be aduanced; thou saiest, Let thy king∣dome come, and yet hast thou no care to helpe forward Gods kingdome? What is this but to mocke God, who cannot bee mocked, and to deceiue thine owne soule? Thou doest by that praier of thine (thou not caring to helpe forward Gods kingdome) prouoke the Lord to wrath against thee, and of thine owne lippes hee will one day iudge thee If thou then desire that the ministry and preaching of the word of God should bee much profitable to thy children, thy seruants, and others; yea, if thou wouldest not pro∣uoke the Lord to punish thee, as a mocker of his maiesty, and of thine owne mouth to iudge and condemne thee. Then be thou stird vp to carrie in thee a conscience of this dutie, bee thou a fellow-worker with the Minister to the kingdome of GOD; ioine handes with him, to helpe forward the doctrine of the Gospell, by counsell, by admonition, by consolation, by good exam∣ple, and the like, but especially, by whetting the doctrine deliuered by him in the publike ministrie of the word, vp- thy children, thy seruants, and others, and by earnest and hearty praier for a blessing vpon the preaching of the Gospell, and thou shalt finde much comfort in so do∣ing. Further obserue we (in a word) the Apostle saith, these onely among the Iewes, were his worke-fellowes to the kingdome of God. Peter was ei∣ther not at Rome when this Epistle was writen, or else he was much too blame.Where then was Peter, it is like he was not at Rome when the Apostle writ this Epistle, whether hee was there at all, or no, I will not dispute, but it cannot bee that hee sate there as Bishop 25. yeeres, as the Papists hold, as an Arti∣cle of cheir Creed, either he was not at Rome when this E∣pistle was written, or else hee carried himselfe little better, then when he denied his Master.
One thing yet remaines to be considered of vs, namely, the forme, and manner of speach heere vsed by the Apo∣stle, (The kingdome of God) hee puts downe the kingdome of God, for the doctrine of the word and Gospell. The point hence offered is this. That the doctrine of the word, and especially the do∣ctrine  of the Gospell, is the kingdome of God, the do∣ctrine of the word and Gospell, is that whereby God doth in speciall manner rule and raigne amongst vs, and ouer vs, (I say in speciall manner)The doctrine of the word and Gospell is that where∣by God doth rule & raigne amongst vs, and ouer vs, in speciall manner. for by his vniuersall gouern∣ment and prouidence, hee rules ouer all things, both in heauen and earth, yea ouer the Diuels and damned in hell, as the Psalmist saith, Psal. 29.10. the Lord remaines a king for euer, but in speciall manner doth the Lord rule and raigne, by the doctrine of his word and Gospell, by that doth he exercise his kingly power and authority o∣uer his Church and children. And hence is the doctrine of the Gospell called the power of God, 1. Cor. 1.18. and verse 24. the power of God, and the wisedome of God, yea, hence it was that our Sauiour sayd, Iohn 5.25. that the houre should come, and then was, that the dead should heare the voice of the son of God, and should liue. The Lord doth rule and worke so powerfully by the doctrine of his word and gospell, as that thereby he quickeneth, and giueth life to the dead, e∣uen to such as are dead in their sinnes, and makes them liue a new spirituall life, and yeeld obedience and subie∣ction to him, and therfore by that doth he rule and raigne amongst vs, and ouer vs, in speciall manner, and the rea∣son of this is this. The word and gospell, is one of the lawes of Gods king∣dome of grace, and hence is the word, the doctrine of the gospell, called the word of the kingdome, Mat. 13.19. and the law of faith, Rom. 3.27. where is then the reioycing (sayth the Apostle) it is excluded, by what law? of works? nay, but by the law of faith, by the doctrin of the gospell.
Now as an earthly King doth rule and raigne ouer his subiects, and keepes them in awe and order, in speciall manner by the lawes of his Kingdome, so doth the Lord by his word and Gospell, and of the Lawes of his King∣dome of grace, and therefore by that doth he in speciall manner rule and raigne amongst vs, and exercise his king∣ly power ouer his Church and children, hence then it must needes follow, that the more or lesse the doctrine of the word and Gospell,  preuaileth with vs, the more or lesse the Lord raigneth amongst vs, and ouer vs, by the do∣ctrine of his word and Gospell, the more or lesse are wee subiect to the speciall gouernment of the Lord,Triall of our selues, whe∣ther we bee vnder the spe∣ciall gouern∣ment of the Lord or no. if the do∣ctrine of the word and Gospell be powerfull and effectuall amongst vs, then doth the Lord rule and raigne amongst vs, in speciall manner, as our King and Gouernour, if that be powerlesse and fruitlesse, and if that haue no power nor fruit amongst vs, surely then the Lord raignes not a∣mongst vs in speciall manner, the Lord is then in no other sort our King and Gouernour, but as he is King ouer the reprobates, yea, ouer the Diuels, and damned in hell, e∣uen by his generall prouidence, yea, let euery one in par∣ticular examine himselfe touching this poynt, doth the Lord rule and raigne ouer thee, and in thee by the doctrin of his word and Gospell? then is he thy King and Gouer∣nour, in speciall manner, if he doe not so raigne and rule ouer thee, and in thee, certainely thou art not vnder his speciall regiment and gouernment, and thou must know it is not enough for thee, onely to haue vnderstanding of the letter of the word and gospell, but thou must know and feele the power of it. The doctrine of the word and gospell is the kingdome of God, it is in it selfe the arme of the Lord, and his ru∣ling power, and it must be so to thee, else thou art not vn∣der his speciall gouernment, thou must feele the doctrine of the word and gospell, teaching thee to humble thy selfe in due consideration of thy miserable state wherein thou
art by nature, and to denie thy selfe in a true acknowledg∣ment of thine owne corruption, and to lay fast hold vpon Christ, who is the light of thy saluation, yea, thou must finde the doctrine of the gospell, teaching thee (as the A∣postle saith) Tit. 2.12. to deny vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, to liue soberly, and righteously and godly, in this present world, yea, the power of the gospell must be seene in thy attire, that thou goest comely, not vainely and ga∣rishly; in thy speech, that it be gracious, not idle, wanton or blasphemous, in thy whole carriage, and in all the acti∣ons of thy life. If the doctrine of the word and gospell be not thus powerfull ouer thee, and in thee, assuredly, the Lord is not thy King, and gouernor in speciall manner, thinke on it and hereby examine thy selfe, and if thou finde that thou art not vnder the speciall gouernment of the Lord, thy case is fearefull, hasten out of it, as soon as possibly thou canst, thou art in a miserable state, and condition, thy case is worse then the case of other creatures in the world, that are subiect to the generall gouernment and prouidence of God, for thou art subiect to the power of the Deuill, thou art his slaue, and the Deuill holdeth vp his scepter in thee he is thy Lord, and King, therefore Paul said Act. 26.18. that he was sent to the Gentiles to turne them by the prea∣ching of the Gospell, from the power of Satan to God, ignorant people and prophane persons cannot abide to heare of this, that the Deuill should rule in them, and that he should be their Lord and King, they spit at the meaning of the Deuill, and they say fie on him, and they defie the Deuill with all their heart, but alas, so long as they liue in their ignorance, and prophanenesse, they are vnder his power, so long as thou liuest in thy pride, thy couetous∣nesse, thy vsury, thy maliciousnesse, thy drunkennesse, thy whoredome, thy swearing, or any other pleasing sinne, thou art from vnder the speciall gouernment of the Lord, and the Deuill is thy Lord, and King, for there be but two
regiments and kingdomes in this world, the kingdome of Christ and the kingdome of Sathan, and if thou be not in the kingdome of Christ, thou art in Sathans kingdome. Againe consider that condemnation, and euerlasting perdition, is the portion of all that haue not Christ for their head. Note.Now Christ is head to none, but such as haue their life from him, and none haue life from Christ, but they that are ruled and gouerned by him, and he rules none but by the power of his word: and therefore if thou be not ruled and ordered by the doctrine of the worde and Gospell, thou art in a fearefull condition, thou hast Satan rule∣ing ouer thee, as thy Lord, and King, and thou art lyable to euerlasting perdition. Consider this, thou that art an ignorant person, thou that art a proud person, a drunkard &c. And findinge thy selfe in this miserable thraldome, hasten out of it by all possible meanes, neuer rest till thou find, that thou art made subject, to the doctrine of the word, and Gospell, and that it is powerfull in thee: causing thee to lay aside thy former sinne, and turning thee to all holy obedience, then thou maiest be sure that thou art vn∣der Gods speciall rule, and gouernment. Againe, is it so that the Lord doth in speciall manner rule, and raigne ouer his Church, and children by the doctrine of his word and Gospell. Heere is then mat∣ter of great comfort for all that cheerefully subject them∣selues to the doctrine of the word, and Gospell:Comfort for all that cheer∣fully subiect themselues to the doctrine of the word and Gospell. they are vnder the speciall rule and gouernment of the Lord; the Lord is their King, and gouernour in speciall manner, and to them as to the true and loyall subjects of his kingdome, are all the benifits of his kingdome belonging, and com∣municated, euen the spirituall, and eternall benifites of Christ, as faith, true conuersion, remission of sinnes, right∣eousnesse, the gifts of Gods spirite, and continuance of the same, glorification, and life eternall, and they are made partakers of that glorie, to bee kinges, and priestes, vnto
God, Reuel. 16. Which is an excellent comfort, and to bee thought on, by all that truely submit themselues to the doctrine of the word and gospell. And thus wee haue handled the second thing, wherby the Apostle commen∣ded thse three men, Aristarcus, Marcus, and Iesus, com∣mon to them all, that they onely were his worke-lellowes vnto the kingdome of God. Come we to the third, and last thing, whereby hee sets out their commendation joyntlie together, in the last wordes of this verse: that they were to his comfort, and consolation, (which haue beene vnto my consolation) and this in part is an effect of the former, namely, of their ioyning hands with him, to the aduancement of the Kingdome of God, and to helpe forward the doctrine of the Gospell, therein they were to the Apostles consolation,Interpre∣tation. the word heere rendred consolation, signifies also councell and en∣couragement, and so the meaning is briefely this. Which haue beene to my comfort, to my councell, and to my encouragement. Now for matter of doctrine hence offered, first in that the Apostle saith these three men Aristarchus, Marcus, and Iesus, helping forward the kingdome of God and fur∣thering the doctrine of the gospell together with himselfe, were to his consolation, and did thereby much comfort him, we are giuen to vnderstand thus much. That the aduancers of the kingdome of God, and such  as with others further, and help forward the doctrine of the gospell, they are a consolation to the godly, and espe∣cialy to the ministers of the gospell. It is a great comfort to the ministers of the Gospell, when they see others ioyne hands with them to the ad∣uancement of gods kingdome,It is a great comfort to the ministers of the Gospell when they see others ioyne hands with them to the aduancement of Gods king∣dome. and to the furthering of the gospell. For why? If their hearts be rightly affected, and set as they ought to be for the aduancement of Gods glory, if the first and chiefe thing they aime at, and seeke after, be the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse,  as
it ought to be Math. 6.33. it must needes be that such as together with themselues, doe further, and aduance the same, are a great consolation to them, and minister sweete comfort to their hearts. Wouldest thou then be a comfort to the minister of the gospell, dost thou desire to cheere vp his heart, and to hearten and encourage him? Oh then ioyne handes with him in aduancing the kingdome of God,The right way to cheere vp the heart of a faithfull mi∣nister is to ioine hands with him in aduancing Gods king∣dome. and in helping forward the doctrine of the gospell, it may be thou bea∣rest true loue to a faithfull minister of the gospell, and thou wouldst be glad to doe him any good thou art able, here is the way to do the best good, and to yeeld him the greatest comfort, ioyne thy hands with him in aduancing the kingdome of God, and in furthering the doctrine of the gospell, and that will be an excellent cordiall, to the comfort of his heart, thou canst not minister matter of greater ioy, and consolation to him, by any thing, then by so doing. Now further in that the Apostle saith these three men, Aristarchus, Marcus, and Iesus, had beene to his consola∣tion and encouragement, and been in steede of councel∣lors to him in some things, hee being an Apostle, and a man of excellent gifts, and graces, and they no doubt far inferiour to him in gifts, and graces, it teacheth vs. That euen men of great gifts and graces haue neede sometimes of encouragement, of councell and comfort from such as be of meaner gifts and graces then them∣selues.Men of great gifts & graces neede some∣times encou∣ragement counsell, and comfort from men of mea∣ner gifts and graces then themselues. And hence it was that our Apostle said, hee longed to see the Romanes, Rom. 1.12. that he might be comforted together with them, through their mutuall faith, both his and theirs, and (indeed) the reason of this is plaine, namely this. The Lord doth not giue all gifts to any one man, nor the like measure of the same gift to euery man,  but to some one gift, and to some another, to some a greater, to some
a lesse measure of the same gift, yea the Lord doth some∣times so dispose his gifts, as that a man of meaner place and fewer gifts, hath some singular and speciall gift, wher∣by he may help, and do good to others, of higher place, and of greater gifts. This then must teach vs not to despise men of meaner giftes then our selues;  Men of mea∣ner gifts then our selues are not to be de∣spised of vs. Do not thou in regard of thine ex∣cellent knowledge, wisedome, or any one gift, or grace of God bestowed on thee, lift vp thy self aboue others, and disdaine to haue familiar conference, and speach with men of meaner gifts then thy selfe, no, no, doe thou stoope downe, to conferre with them, and to listen to things said by them, and take thou benefit of some gift, (happily) more eminent, and in greater measure in them, then in thy selfe, though thou excell them in knowledge, yet it may be they go beyond thee in good affections, and thereby they may do thee good, they may be meanes to stirre vp thy zeale, to quicken thy loue, or the like, yea certainely thou maist finde some good by hauing speech, and confe∣rence with the meanest of Gods children. VER. 12 Epaphras the seruant of Christ, which is one of you, saluteth you, and alwaies striueth for you in praiers, that ye may stand per∣fect and full in all the will of God. VER. 13 For I beare him record that he hath a great zeale for you, and for them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. The Apostle in this 12. and 13. verses still goes on in the second branch of his conclusion, namely, the decla∣ration of the loue of others that were with him towardes the Colossians, and heere he sets downe, the loue of Epa∣phras
towards them, manifested, and made knowne by two things. By his salutations sent to them, and by his praiers for them. That hee saluted them, and that he praied for them, Now these things are not thus naked, and barely pro∣pounded, but first the Apostle describes Epaphras, by two qualities or conditions. First, by his calling, that he was the seruant of Christ. Secondly, by that particular relation that was betweene him and the Colossians, that he was one of them, Epaphras the seruant of Christ which is one of you saluteth you. And then the Apostle further sets out Epaphras by his praying for the Colossians. First, by the manner of his praying, that it was with stri∣uings and earnest contention, and that continually, in these words, (and alwaies striueth for you in praiers). Secondly by the matter of his praier, what it was hee praied for, on their behalfe, namely this, that they might stand perfect, and full in all the will of God. And then verse 13. the Apostle doth discouer the effi∣cient cause of that earnest striuing of Epaphras in praier, for the Colossians, that it proceeded from his zeale for them, which zeale of his is further set out by the measure, that it was great: and by the extent of it, in regard of the persons to whom it reached, that it reached not onely to the Colossians, but also to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis: and it is also confirmed by the testimonie of the Apostle, I beare him record he hath a great zeale for you, &c. in which testimonie is also preuented a secret obiecti∣on, for happily the Colossians might haue said to the A∣postle. Obiect: How know you that Epaphras striueth in prayer for vs, are you priuie to his priuate prayers, for therein especially, if hee doe remember vs, hee makes mention of vs?
Now this obiection the Apostle preuents when he saith, (for I beare him record that he hath a great zeale for you, &c. as if he had said, howsoeuer I am not priuy to his priuate prayers, yet I dare boldly write, that he striueth for you in prayer, because I am priuie to, and a witnesse of a great zeale that he beares to you, and to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. And thus we see the generall things that are laid downe in these two verses. Come we now to speake of them, as they lye in order, and I will take the words as they are layd downe be∣fore vs. First therefore of these words, (Epaphras the seruant of Christ, which is one of you, saluteth you, and alwaies striueth for you in praiers.) Epaphras the seruant of Christ] That first title, (seruant of Christ) is not heere to bee taken in a generall significa∣tion, as it is common to all the faithfull, who are seruants of Christ, 1 Cor. 7.22. but in a speciall sense, for the mini∣ster of Christ: for so the Apostle called Epaphras, cap: 1.7. and therefore this title (seruant of Christ) is not heere gi∣uen to him as a qualitie and condition,Interpre∣tation. common to him with all true beleeuers: but as signifying his particular of∣fice and function, that hee serued Christ in the ministerie of the gospell▪ (which is one of you) how these words are to be taken, wee shewed verse 9. namely thus, who is one of the same Citie and Church with you▪ (saluteth you) that is, wisheth you health, prosperitie, and all true happinesse that can be. (And alwaies striueth for you in praiers.) The word striueth is metaphoricall borrowed, and taken from such as withstand open violence and hostilitie: or from such as earnestly striue for masteries or life, against such as seeke to take it away: and it is heere put, to signifie ear∣nestnesse and feruencie of spirit▪ (alwaies) that is, when∣soeuer he doth humble himselfe in prayer, (which he doth often) he remembers you. Thus then are these words to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had said.
Epaphras that serues Chist in the ministerie of the Gospell, who is one of the same Citie and Church with you, wishth you health, prospe∣ritie, and all true hppinesse and comfort, and whensoeuer he doth humble himselfe in prayer, (which he doth often) he is mindfull of you, and with earnest contention of minde, and feruencie of spirit, he praies for you. Now first in that the Apostle calls Epaphras the seruant of Christ, thereby meaning the minister of Christ, or that he serued Christ, in the ministerie of the gospell, wee are taught thus much. That the minister of the gospell is the seruant of Christ: yea the minister of the gospell in regard of his function and office, is in speciall manner the seruant of Christ,The Minister of the gospell is in speciall manner the serunt of Christ. he is Christ his seruant in more particular manner, then men of other callings, it is his profession, and (as it were) his trade, to be the seruant of Christ, euen to serue the Lord Iesus, in bringing his message, and his embassage to the people of God, that is his place and office. And theefore the Apostle saith in plaine termes, 2 Cor. 5.20. that the ministers of the gospell are Ambassadors for Christ, and in Christ his stead do intreat Gods people to be reconciled vnto him, 1 Cor. 4.1. Let a man so thinke of vs as of the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God; and hence it is that the Apostle often calls himselfe and other ministers of the gospell, the seruants of Christ: as Rom: 1.1. Paul a seruant of Iesus Christ. Philipp. 1.1. Paul and Timotheus the seruants of Iesus Christ. Titus 1.1. Paul a seruant of God, &c. yea the deuill himself plainly & feely confessed this truth, though not in loue to the mini∣sters of the gospel. Act: 16.17. These men are the seruants of the most high God, which shew vnto vs the way of saluation. Now then this serues to teach ministers of the gospell
a speciall duty;Ministers of the gospell must looke they deliuer nothing, but that which is according to the will of Christ, and for his glory. are they in peculiar manner seruants of the Lord Iesus Christ, their Lord and master? are they sent out from him on his message and embassage? surely then they must looke they deliuer nothing but that which is both according to his will, and for his glory: a good ser∣uant will do the will of his Master, and what his Master appoints him, and what he requires of him, and will seeke his Masters credit in all his courses: and so ought the mi∣nisters of the gospell, euer to haue an eye to the will of Christ, their Lord and Master, and to seeke his glory in all things: those ministers forget their office and calling, that they are the seruants of Christ, who deliuer their own fan∣cies, and new found deuices, or apply their speeches and teaching to the humors of men, and seeke to please men. Gal: 1.10 If I should yet please men, I were not the seruant of Christ: Ministers that are men-pleasers are not the true seruants of Christ. Againe, heere is matter of comfort for all true ministers  of the gospell▪Comfort for all true Mini∣sters of the gospell. for why? are they in speciall manner ser∣uants of the Lord Iesus, to whom all power is giuen in heauen and in earth, Matth. 28.18. they may then be bold to deliuer the message the Lord hath put into their mouthes, they haue a Master will make it good, and they may boldly stand in the face of all that oppose them and gaine-say it, they haue a Master that is able and willing to defend them, and this is an excellent comfort vnto them. Now further, is it so, is a true minister of the gospell in  speciall manner the seruant of Christ?Men are to esteeme the Ministers of the gospell, as the seruants of Christ. then learne thou so to esteeme him, euen as the seruant and ambassador of the Lord of glory, and take heed thou offer him not the least contempt or wrong, in word or deed, though hee be (hap∣pily) poore and weake, yet he hath a Master, that is migh∣ty and powerfull, and will mightily reuenge the wrong done to his seruants. Ahab, Iezabell, and Iulian found it by wofull experience, and no age or state, can shew the
contrary, that euer any contemner or abuser of a true mi∣nister of God, escaped the visible vengeance of God, and his reuenging hand on him, or his; therefore take heed how thou doest wrong, or abuse a minister of the Gos∣pell. I should now speake of two titles the Apostle heere giues to Epaphras, (that he was one of the Colossians) and like∣wise of his saluting of them, but of those things wee spake verse 9.10. and therefore I passe by them, and come to these words (and alwaies striueth for you in prayers.) where first, in that the Apostle saith, that Epaphras did striue in prayers for the Colossians, that whensoeuer he humbled himselfe in prayer, he prayed for them with earnest con∣tention of minde, with feruencie of spirit, wee are plainly taught. That we must pray for others together with our selues, we must be earnest in prayer for others, and pray for them with a feruencie of spirit, especially for those with whom we stand in some special relation,We must ear∣nestly pray for others to∣gether with our selues, and especially those with whom wee stand in speci∣all relation. and with whom we haue neere coniunction: for Epaphras was the minister of the Church at Colosse, and hee prayed earnestly for the Co∣lossians, as he was their minister, and so must we be earnest in prayer, for those with whom wee stand in some speciall relation, and with whom we haue neere coniunction: as the Minister for his people, the Magistrate for those that be vnder his gouernment, the Master of the house for his familie, &c. We haue examples of this in other places of Scripture, as that of Samuell, 1 Sam. 12.23. God forbid (saith Samuel) that I should sinne against the Lord, and cease praying for you. Samuell accounted it a sinne, if hee should cease praying for the people. And that of Moses, Psal: 106.23. where it is said, that he stood in the breach, no doubt by earnest in∣tercession and prayer, to turne away the Lords wrath from the people: and thus (doubtlesse) did Iob sanctifie his children, by earnest and hearty prayer for them, Iob 1.5.
and the reason of this is plaine, namely this. We are to haue a liuely fellow feeling of the wants and necessities of others, and as the Apostle saith,  1 Cor. 12.25. we ought to haue the same care one for another, as mem∣bers of the same body, and especially of the wants and ne∣cessities of them, with whom we are more neerly knit and conioyned: and therefore out of that liuely feeling of the wants of others, and especially for such as are neerly knit vnto vs by any special bond, we are to send out earnest and hearty praiers for them, and to call on the Lord euen with feruencie of spirit, for a supply of their wants. A duty wherein many of vs are much defectiue,Reproofe of such as sel∣dom or neuer pray for o∣thers together with them∣selues with any earnestnes many seldom or neuer pray for others together with themselues with any earnestnesse and feruencie of spirit: it may bee thou art somtimes earnest in praying for thy selfe, necessi∣tie, or extremitie pressing thee, the hand of God in some heauy affliction driuing thee to it: but in praying for o∣thers, oh how cold art thou? yea (I feare me) I may iust∣ly speake it, many seldome or neuer vse any earnest praier for their owne families, for their owne children, and those that belong vnto them: happily thou saiest, God blesse my children, and God make them his faithfull seruants, (which I speake not against) but when didst thou striue in praier for them? when didst thou powre out thine heart, as Dauid said he did, Psal. 42.4. in the behalfe of thy chil∣dren, thy seruants, or for the wife of thy bosome? I ap∣peale to the hearts and consciences of many, they can tell them, they haue seldome or neuer done it: well remem∣ber, this is thy duty thus to pray for others, together with thy selfe, and that with earnestnesse of spirit, and especial∣ly for those, to whom thou owest speciall duty, for thy wife, thy children, thy seruants: and to that end, consider their speciall wants and necessities, and if thou neglect this dutie, it is a plaine euidence thou hast not such a fee∣ling of other mens wants and necessities, as thou oughtest to haue, and it is an argument thou art not a liuely mem∣ber
of the same body with them, whereof Christ is the head, and if thou pray not earnestly for thy wife, children, and seruants, and out of a feeling of their wants, thou hast not that loue, and that care of them, that ought to be in thee, and without repentance thou shalt one day an∣swer for it; yea many times it comes to passe, that a man that makes no conscience of this duty,Note. euen to bee earnest with the Lord in prayer for supply of such grace, as is wanting in his wife, children, and seruants, he findes the punishing hand of God vpon him in his wife, children, or seruants: the Lord doth punish him with an vnruly wife, with gracelesse children, and with lewd seruants; therefore learne then to make conscience of this dutie. Now further in that the Apostle sets downe Epaphras his manner of praying for the Colossians vnder that me∣taphoricall word (striueth) a word borrowed and taken from such as withstand violence and hostilitie, or such as striue for masteries, we are giuen to vnderstand. That it is no easie thing to pray well,It is no easie thing to pray well. to pray to God truly and heartily, is no easie matter: true and hearty praier is euer with striuing, and wrestling against opposi∣tion, and it is as hard a matter to pray truly and heartily, as it is to with stand a strong armed man, that seeks to take away life from vs. And therefore the Apostle not onely heere but in other places also, vseth this phrase and forme of speech; as Ro: 15.30. I beseech you for our Lord Iesus Christs sake, and for the loue of the spirit, that yee would striue with me by prayers to God for me. and 2 Cor. 1.11. (saith he) that yee labour together in prayer for vs, plainly teaching. That true and hearty praier is with much labor and striuing,  and the rea∣son of it is this.Hinderances of true and hearty praier. There be many things that oppose, and stand against making of true and hearty prayer to God, as First, the malice of Satan, who seeks (if possibly he can)  to keep vs from praying at all, by troubling our mindes, and disturbing our hearts, with passions of loue, feare, an∣ger,
and the like: if he cannot so doe, then hee labours to make vs hasten out of our praiers, and to poste them ouer hastily, or to pray coldly or faintly. Secondly, our owne corruption, the deadnesse and  dulnesse of our owne hearts, our want of feeling of our wants, our want of holy desires and the like, they stand vp against that holy exercise of prayer: the euill examples of others, who either neglect that duty of praier, or coldly performe it, onely for fashion and custome; these are the things that stand vp against vs in praier, and with these are we to striue and wrestle in making true and hearty praier. And therefore it is no easie matter to pray well, and to of∣fer vp praiers to God truly and heartily. And therfore deceiue not thy selfe, do not thou thinke  as many doe, that it is an easie matter to pray well,They deceiue themselues which thinke it is an easie matter to pray well. and to make heartie praier to God: no, no, learne this lesson, and remember it, that to pray truly and heartily, is a thing that is done with as much paines and labour, as if thou wert to wrestle and struggle with a strong man that seeks thy life: some foolishly thinke, and they sticke not sometimes to speake it, that hauing liued many yeeres in scraping wealth together, and hunting after riches, when they are old, then they will goe to the Church and pray: alas poore soules, how are they blinded, as if it were the easiest matter in the world, to pray well: indeed, to pray formally, and to say praiers, (as some vse to speake, that they haue said their praiers) and you may beleeue them, their mouthes onely haue praied, their hearts praied not, they praied not with any due reuerence of the great and glorious maiestie of God, with any sound feeling of their owne wants, or with any holy desire of the things praied for: and so to pray, is an easie matter indeed: but that is but lip-labour, and (in∣deed) lost labour, yea hatefull and displeasing to God: remember thou, if thou wouldst pray well, and so as the Lord may accept thy praier, that it must bee with much striuing, thou must finde in thee a striuing against the ma∣lice
of Satan, and against the deadnesse and dulnesse of thine owne heart, yea there must be an holy violence vsed in thine heart, when thou praiest, and that is to pray truly and heartily. Againe, is it so, that true and hearty praier is euer with striuing and wrestling against opposition? Heere is then matter of comfort for such as finde some∣times a dednesse,Comfort for such as finde sometimes a dulnesse and deadnesse vp∣on themselues in praying. and dulnesse creeping vpon themselues in the hoie exercise of praier, if so be they doe truly striue against these things; some are much cast downe, and dis∣couraged, and they thinke their praiers are not pleasing to God, because they finde sometimes in themselues a deadnesse, and dulnesse, and many by-thoughs, cast in∣to their minds but consider with thy selfe, dost thou striue against these? Art thou displeased with them? Dost thou sigh and groane vnder them, and are they so heauy a bur∣den vnto thee, as thou canst onely stammer out a praier vnto God? Comfort thy selfe, euen that stammering praier of thine is true, and heartie praier, and well-plea∣sing to God, thou hst an example for thy comfort in this kinde, Isai. 38 14. Like a Crane or a Swallow, so did I chat∣ter, I did mourne as a Doue. Hezekiah was so pressed with griefe, as that his praier was onely like the chattering of a Crane, he was not able to vtter a perfect sentence, yet was his praier heard of the Lord; so if thou bee able onely to vtter a stamering praier in regard of thy deadnesse, and dulnesse, sometimes creeping vpon thee, yet if thou sigh and groane vnder it, if thou pray against it, and by all good meanes striue against it, and looke for the perfection of thy praiers in Christ; assuredly thy praiers are true and hear∣tie praiers, and well-pleasing in the sight of God, and that is an excellent comfort to be thought on, by all such as finde a deadnesse and dulnesse sometimes creeping on them in praier, and are displeased with it, and doe truely striue against it. Before wee come to that which followeth, a question
is to be answered, namely this. In that true and heartie praier is euer with striuing a∣gainst opposition, it may bee demanded,Whether a man may striu in praier, in a set forme of praier whether a man may striue in praier, that vseth a set forme of praier. To this I answer, that he may, a man that is not able to conceiue a forme of praier in words, as some are not, for want of memorie, vtterance,  and other gifts of grace need∣full to the conceiuing of a praier, such a man helping him∣selfe by a set forme of praier, by a praier composed, and made by others, may vse it with striuing, for his heart may goe with his mouth, and hee may be stird vp,Note. and haue a feeling of the want of the things that are praied for: but yet let not any man heerein take liberty to himselfe, at all times to vse a set forme of praier, for that cannot at all times expresse his particular wants, and necessities, and therefore let euery one labour that he may be able to con∣ceiue a praier, and to take to himselfe words, as it is, Ho∣sea 14.3. And if a man or woman be suddenly pressed by some calamitie, or some sinne pressing the conscience, and that person is not able to conceiue a praier, then let him, or her, in such a case, rather goe to the Lord with sigh∣ing, and groaning, with sighes that hee cannot expresse in words, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 8.26. then betake him∣self to a set forme of praier, which happily makes no men∣tion of that speciall grace, he stands in neede of. Come we now to the matter of Epaphras his praier, what it was he praied for, on the behalfe of the Colossians, laid downe in these words (That yee may stand perfect and full in all the will of God.) These words require a little search into them, for the right vnderstanding. (That yee may stand) The word (stand) as wee know,Interpre∣tation. be∣ing applied to men, properly signifieth, an action or posi∣tion of the body of man, opposed to falling, starting aside, shrinking, or backsliding, but in Scripture it is often vsed in a Metaphoricall and borrowed sense, signifying, con∣tinuance,
constancie, and perseuerance, as in the 1. Cor. 16.13. Stand fast in the faith, &c. the meaning is continue, be constant, and perseuer in the faith, shrinke not, start not aside, nor slide backe from it, and that that is his meaning, it is cleare, in that hee addes, quit you like men, and bee strong, and so it is heere to bee taken; That yee may stand, (that is) that yee may continue, abide, and perseuer, with∣out shrinking, starting aside, or backe-sliding, (perfect and full) these words being words of relation (for where there is a perfection, and fulnesse, it must needs be a perfection and fulnesse of something) we may gather wherunto they haue relation by the words following (in all the wil of God) These words considered together with that praier of the Apostle, cap. 1.9.10. Where hee saith, I cease not to pray for you, and to desire, that yee might be fulfilled with knowledge of his will in all wisdome and spirituall vnderstanding. By these two places compared together, wee may easily conceiue whereunto these words (perfect and full) haue relation, namely, to the knowledge, and obedience to the will of God, as if the Apostle had said, perfect and full in know∣ledge, and obedience to the will of God. Now seuerally, that word (perfect) doth not heere sig∣nifie absolutely perfect, in knowledge and obedience to Gods will perfect, with a perfection of knowledge and o∣bedience, in measure and degree which cannot be reached in this life, but soundly perfect, with perfection of sound∣nesse, and truth opposed to hypocriticall holinesse, and emptinesse, and so the word (perfect) is often vsed in Scrip∣ture, Isai. 38.3. Hezekia said, hee had walked before the Lord in truth, and with a perfect heart: he puts these two together, and therefore the Apostle heere addes the word (full) giuing vs to vnderstand, that he meant such a perfe∣ction, as is opposed to emptinesse, and hollownesse. And againe, the word (full) is not heere to be taken for an ab∣solute fulnesse of knowledge and obedience, in degree, but for a true, and sound fulnesse, for so also that word is
sometimes, vsed, as 1 Ioh. 1.4. These things write I vnto you that your ioy may bee full, (that is) that your ioy may bee true, sound, and sincere, (in all the will of God) by the will of God we are to vnderstand, the will of God reuealed, and by (all) is meant, the whole will of GOD re∣uealed. Thus then briefely are these words to be conceiued, as if the Apostle had said. Epaphras, hee praies earnestly for you, that you may continue, perseuere, and goe on, sound, and sincere, and truely, though not absolutely, full of knowledge, and of obe∣dience, to the whole reuealed will of God. First, obserue we, that Epaphras heere praying to God, and that earnestly, for the Colossians, that they might continue and perseuere, sound, sincere, and truely full of knowledge and obedience to the will of God. I might hence shew that the faithfull, and feruent praiers of others are needfull euen for such as are sound, sincere, and truly full of knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, that they may be strengthened, and may stand fast, perseuere, and goe on in the same, and they are to craue the assistance of other mens praiers to that purpose, but on that I will not stand. Hence, in that Epaphras praied that the Colossians might stand perfect and full in all the will of God, imply∣ing that they were already sound, and sincere in know∣ledge and obedience to the will of God, and he praied for their constancy and continuance in the same. Wee may easily gather That constancy and perseuerance in sound knowledge, and in true, and sincere obedience to Gods will, is the free gift of God,Perseuerance in soūd know¦ledge and in sincere obedi∣ence to Gods will, is the free gift of God. Epaphras praied for it, that the Lord would giue it to the Colossians, it is not only Gods free gift to be
sound in knowledge, and sincere in obedience, but it is his gift also to stand, continue, and goe on in that soundnesse, and in that sincerity, the Lord giues to know, and to obey his will, and hee giues continuance in that knowledge and obedience. And howsoeur, such as haue sound and sauing know∣ledge, and sincere obedience to the will of God, truely wrought in them, shall neuer wholly fall away from it, for the feae of God is put into their hearts, that they shall not part from God, Ierem, 32.40. Yet they stand not by any poer from themselues, but by the power of God, 1 Pet. 1.5. They are kpt by the power of God, through faith vnto sal∣uation. It is the power of God that vpholds them, and it is the Spirit of God that doth still stir and moue their minds and wils, being alreadie regenerate, to minde, and to will, that which is truely good, and makes them able to bring foorth good actions, which otherwise, they are not able being hindred by the flesh, so long as they are in this life. Hence it was that Dauid after his regeneration, praied to the Lord to incline his heart vnto his Testimonies; and the Church praies for new drawing, Cantic. 1.4. Draw me, wee will runne after thee: and the Apostle witnessing of the Philippians, Phil. 2.12. That they had alwaies obeyed: yet hee addes, Verse 13. That it was God that wrought in them both th will, and the deed, euen of his good pleasure, it was not of themselues that they were able to will or worke any  good thing. And so he plainely teacheth this point. That to continue in sound knowledge, and sincere obedience to Gods will, and to goe one in the same, is the free gift of God▪ First, this meetes with that opinion of the Papists, who teach that men regenerate are able to do good, and to o∣bey the will of God, and to go on without concurrence of new grace following,That popish opinion con∣futed, that men regene∣re are able to do good and to obey Gods will without concurrence of new grace following. which is a meere falshood, it cannot stand with the truth now deliuered.
For if it be the free gift of God, to continue in sound knowledge and sincere obedience, certainly then besides the first grace working regeneration, there must bee a subsequent second grace vouchsafed from the Lord, that makes the regenerate do, and worke that good, which they are made able to do by grace, it cannot be otherwise. Againe, is it so that to continue and perseuere in sound  knowledge and sincere obedience to thee will of God is the free gift of God;Such as are truly regene∣rate, are to acknowledge at all times their owne impotency & insufficiencie to any good thing. Then let those in whom the Lord hath wrought sound sauing knowledge, and a measure of sincere obedience to his will, euer acknowledge their own impotency and insufficiencie, that though they be truely regenerate, yet they are not, able to do any good thing, but by a continued supply of new grace, and let them e∣uer acknowledge that their standing, and perseuerance in sound and sincere obedience to the will of God, is meere∣ly from the Lord, and let him haue all the glory, and bee thou euer watchfull in praier for constancy, and perseue∣rance, because thy standing is by grace, and it is the free gift of God. Now in the next place in that Epaphras praied so ear∣nestly, and with such feruency, for no other grace but this, that the Colossians might constantly continue and perse∣uere, and go on in sound and sincere knowledge, and obe∣dience to the will of God, we are plainely taught. That constancie and perseuerance in sound, sincere, en∣tire,  and full knowledge and obedience to the will of God is an excellent thing,Constancy & perseuerance in sound knowledge & obedience to Gods will is an excellent thing. it is a speciall grace for such as are sound and sincere in knowledge, and obedience to the will of God, to stand fast, to continue, and to go on in the same, without starting aside, or backe-sliding. We finde in the Scripture many exhortations, and sen∣tences to this purpose, as that 1. Cor. 16.13. stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, and be strong, and that Reuel. 2.10. be thou faithfull vnto the death and I will giue thee the crowne of life, and this warning hath our sauiour gi∣uen
Luk. 9.62.Luke. 9.62. he that putteth his hand to the plough and but looketh backe is not apt for the kingdome of God, Paul blamed the Galathians Gal. 3.3. and called them foo∣lish, for beginning in the spirit, and then seeking to bee mde perfect in the flesh, for not holding on as they had begunne, many other places of scripture beate vpon this point, and persuade to continuance, and perseuerance in grace, and holy obedience, as a most excellent thing, and a speciall grace, and the reason of it is this. Of all grace, and vertues, it is only constancie, and perseuerance▪ that shall be crowend, As no sinne condemnes a man but his finall impenitencie,Note. a finall continuance in his sinne, so no grace, or vertue shall bee crowned, but that which continues to the end. It is onely continuance, and perseuerance in faith, in loue, in the feare of God, and in profession of religion, that shall be crowned with glory, we shall finde it most true which the Prophet speakes Ezechiell 18.24. If a righte∣ous man of a hundred yeeres old forsake his righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, and do according to all the abho∣minations that the wicked man doth, the Lord will also forget all his righteousnesse he hath done, and as our Sauiour saith Math. 24.13. he that endureth to the end, he shall be saued, and therefore we may safely conclude, that continuance, and perseuerance in sound and sincere knowledge, & obedience to the will of God, is a most ex∣cellent thing, and a speciall grace. If then thou hast entred into profession of religion, if thou hast begunne to shew thy selfe sound in knowledge and sincere in obedience to Gods will;Such as haue begunne to shew them∣selues sound in knowledge & sincere in obe∣dience to Gods will ought to go on in the same. Oh be constant in that soundnes, and in that sinceritie, go on in the same, re∣member it is a most excellent thing to stand perfect, and full in true knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, and this is a needfull exhortation, and cannot be often inough, and sufficiently vrged, in this back-sliding age, and in these declining times of ours, wherein many shrinke backe, and
start aside from the sound and sincere profession of the gospell, and obedience to Gods will, some haue hereto∣fore seemed to be sound & sincere in professing the faith, but now they shrinke backe from that soundnesse, and sin∣ceritie, and as Christ said to the Church of Ephesus Reuel. 2.4, haue lost their first loue, some heretofore seemed to haue care to sanctifie the sabboth, to traine vp their fami∣lies in the feare of God, to pray with them, and seemed to make conscience of other holy duties, but alas, now they are shrunke backe from their first loue, and former works, and there is now in them, almost an vtter forsaking of all good duties, wel, remember whosoeuer thou art, that there is no pleasing of God, nor hope of glory, without perse∣uerance in sound and sincere obedience to Gods will,Note. to the end. The Lord is an eternall God, and his will eternall, and he requires a perpetuall seruice, and obedience, remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and doe thy former workes; And to returne to our exhortation begun, if thou beest one that art yet sound and sincere in the pro∣fession of the gospell, in knowledge, and obedience to Gods will, be stirred vp to stand fast, and to go on in the same, and to that end further consider these two things. 2 Motiues to stirre vp such as are sound & sincere in the profession of the Gospell to continue and to go on in the same.First, the Lord receiueth much more dishonour by the back-sliding of such as hauing entred into the professi∣on of the gospell, do afterwards fall away, either renoun∣cing faith, or denying the power of it by an vngodly life, then he doth by the ignorance, and impiety of such as ne∣uer entertained that way. And secondly, the falling from grace, though but in part is dangerous, it is an hard thing to recouer that fall, it will cost thee many a sigh, and ma¦ny  a salt teare, and happily, thou shalt neuer recouer the feeling of that comfort, that once thou hadst. The state of those that fall backe from the profession of the gospell, is more dangerous, and more hard to be re∣couered, then of those that neuer entred into the way of godlinesse, 2. Pet. 2.20. and therefore if thou be entred
into sound and sincere profession of the gospell, labour to stand fast, and to continue in the same, & that thou maist  so do, looke there be in thee these two things especially. 2 Speciall things requi∣red in them that would continue in the sound and sincere profes∣sion of the Gospell.First, a receiuing of the Gospell with a loue of it, sim∣ply for it selfe, euen for the excellent comfort of it, and not for any by respect, not for honor, profit, praise of men, and such like, if thou receiue the gospell in respect of ho∣nor, profit, and the like, thou wilt hold the profession of it, no longer then it may stand with the enioying of those things, and if by occasion, the gospell hinder the holding of those things, then farwell the profession of it. Secondly, looke there be in thee a mortified heart, an heart emptied of all secret vnbeleife, secret hypocrisie, and spirituall pride, take heede none of these do lurke, and lie hid in thine heart, Heb. 3.12. Take heede saith the Author of that Epistle least at any time there be in any of you, an euill heart and vnfaithfull, or an heart of infidelity to de∣part away from the liuing God, and if these things bee in thee. A receiuing of the gospell with a loue of it, simply for it selfe. And a mortified heart, emptied of all secret vnbeleife, hypocrisie, and spirituall pride, vndoubtedly thou hauing begunne to professe the gospell, thy beginning shall haue increase, and at last a perfit worke, and thou shalt bee able to stand fast, and to hold on the constant profession of the Gospell. Now from these words (perfect and full in all the will of God) in that the Apostle sayth (perfect and full) the foolish Familists thinke they haue ground for their absurd and foolish opinion,Confutation of the Fami∣lists, holding an absolute perfection in the regenerate in this life. that there is an absolute perfection in the regenerate, in the time of this life, but alasse, their light braines are deceiued, and the spirit of errour deceiues them, I shewed before how the wordes are to bee taken, namely, perfect and full, in regard of soundnesse and truth, I haue heeretofore shewed the vanity and absurdi∣ty
of that opinion, chap. 3.14. I will not now stand on the large confutation of it, only call to mind that distinction, that then I made, that there is a perfection of parts, & a perfection of degrees, a perfection of parts is an holines in all the faculties of the soule, and in all the parts and members of the body, hauing the seeds of all necessarie vertues with an endeauour to obey God in all things, and that is in the regenerate, in the time of this life. But per∣fection of degrees, that is, an holinesse in all the powers of the soule, and parts of the body, perfect in measure and degree, that is not in any in this life, for as the Apo∣stle sayth, 1. Cor. 13.9. the most regenerate, know but in part, therefore other graces are in them proportionably, but in part, nor perfect in degree, in the time of this life: but I leaue them. Note one thing further, in that Epaphras prayed that the Colossians might stand perfect, sound and sincere in obedience to all the will of God. We are taught. That it is not enough to perfection, and filling to  soundnesse and sincerity,In sound and sincere obedi∣ence to Gods will is requi∣red a confor¦mity to all the will of God. that in some or many things we endeauor to please God, but there must be in vs a con∣formity to all the will of God. There must bee in vs a soundnesse and sincerity, in re∣spect of the whole will of God reuealed, as Dauid sayd, Psal. 119.101. I haue refrained my feete from euery e∣uill way, that I might keepe thy word, and verse 128. I e¦steeme all thy precepts most iust, and hate all false waye, so must we doe, else we are not sound and sincere in our obedience to Gods will. In this case wee must haue no partiall affections,  wee must not hate one sin and loue another,Wee must not carry in vs partiall affe∣ctions in re∣spect of sinne. Herod went so farre, and did many things Iohn taught him, but still hee would haue his brothers wife: so happily many hate co∣uetousnes, & loue drunkennes; others hate drunkennes, and loue swearing, and euery one almost will haue his
darling sinne, and if it be so with thee, thou art not sound and sincere in thy obedience to Gods will, if thou woul∣dest be sound, there must be in thee a purpose and an en∣deauour (howsoeuer thou canst not but fall) to obey God in all things, and at all times, and know thou, that euen one sinne, wherein thou liuest wittingly and willingly, de∣files thy whole life, and the Diuell will not much trouble thee, if he hold thee entangled in any one sinne, that is e∣nough to draw thee downe to perdition, as a little leake in a ship not stopped, will sincke the ship, and hee that makes not conscience of some one sinne, is guilty of brea∣king the whole law, Iam. 2.10. therefore if thou wouldest bee sound and sincere, and haue comfort in thy obedi∣ence to the will of God, looke there bee in thee, a full purpose and an endeauour to obey God in all his com∣mandements. Come we to the thirteenth verse. VER. 13 For I beare him record that he hath a great zeale for you, and for them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. In this verse, as we haue shewed, our Apostle doth dis∣couer the efficient cause of Epaphras his earnest striuing in prayer for the Colossians, that it proceeded and came from his zeale for them, and this verse hath respect to the former, as an argument or reason proouing that Epaphras did striue in prayer for them, taken from the efficient cause of it, namely, his zeale towards them, and that zeale of his, is further set out by the measure of it, by the extent of it, and by the Apostles owne testimonie, For I beare him record (saith the Apostle) that he hath a great zeale for you, the words of this verse need no long exposition, For
I beare him record, or I witnesse with him,Interpreta∣tion. I yeeld him my testimony, that he hath a great zeale, the word (zeale) in Scripture, hath many significations, but hauing heere re∣lation to the Colossians and others, it signifieth a feruent affection of loue, a burning loue, a loue that cannot lie hid, but is like to a fire that is hot, and often breakes out into flame, for you Colossians, and for your neighbours them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis, for Laodicea and Hierapolis were neighbour townes or cities not farre from Colosse. This then is briefely the meaning of the Apostle in the words of this verse. For I witnesse with Epaphras, that he hath a burning loue, euen a loue that often times, like fire flames out, and shewes it selfe, both towards you, and towards your neighbors, them of Laodicea, and them of Hiera∣polis. Consider wee the Apostles argument in this place, in that the Apostle prooues Epaphras his striuing in prayers for the Colossians, by laying foorth his zeale towards them, as the efficient cause, and root of it. He plainely teacheth vs thus much. That out of zeale towards others, euer comes feruent  prayers for them, yea, the poynt is, & may be generall out of zeale, out of burning loue towards others, euer comes a carefull performance & practise of all good duties to∣wards them,Zeale & bur∣ning loue to∣wards others, uer brings foorth a care∣full perfor∣mance and practise of all good duties towards them. as occasion is offered, and according to the measure of zeale, so is the practise of good duties, a great zeale brings foorth feruent prayers, and carefull perfor∣mance of euery good duty, and where zeale and burning loue is wanting, there is either a neglect of good duties al∣together, or a dooing of them for fashion, or for by-re∣spects.
And for further proofe of this, the example of Paul, is most pregnant: he, in many of his Epistles, makes knowne his zeale, and his feruent loue towards those, to whome he wrote. And therevpon, his carefull performance of good du∣ties, ishuing out from thence, euen his carefull instruct∣ing, admonishing, reproouing, comforting, and praying for them, as occasion was offered. 2. Cor. 7.3. Hee saith the Corinthians were in his heart, to dye and liue to∣gether; and from that loue of his, it was that hee made them sorry with a letter, verse 8. and hee saith, verse 12. That hee wrote that letter vnto them, to manifest, and make knowne his care towards them, in the sight of God. From his loue, and from his care towards them, came his carefull reproofe, of that which was amisse in them by his letter. 1. Thess. in the 2. and 3. chapter, hee doth no∣tably cleare the truth of this poynt, in his owne example. Chap. 2. he saith, he was affected towards the Thessaloni∣ans, as a Nurse, and as a Father to his children: and be∣ing thus affectioned (saith he) verse 8. Our good will was to haue dealt vnto you, not the Gospel of God onely, but also our owne soules, because ye weare deere vnto vs. And then verse 11. that from that loue it was, that he ex∣horted them, and comforted them, and besought euerie one of them, as a father his children. And chapter 3.1. he saith, wherefore since wee could no longer forbeare, as if hee had saide, my loue towardes you was such, and so strong within me, it was like a fire in my breast, I could no longer keepe it in, and from thence it was, that I sent Tymo∣theus our brother to establish, and to comfort you touch∣ing your faith, a plaine euidence and proofe of this. That out of zeale and burning loue towards others, e∣uer comes a carefull performance of all good duties, and the reason of this is very plaine,  namely this. True loue is euer industrious, and painfull for the good of those that are beloued: and according to the measure
of it, so is it more or lesse industrious and painefull. And therefore certainely, out of zeale, and burninge loue, euer comes carefull performance of euery good du∣ty. Hence then wee may easilie conceiue,  whence it is that men are not carefull,Whence it îs that men all∣together neg∣lect the doing of good duties to their bre∣thren, or else do them cold∣ly in by-re∣spects. and conscionable in performance of good duties, towardes their bretheren; euen from hence, they haue noe heate in them, they haue no burning affect∣ion of true loue in their hearts towardes their brethren; their hearts are either taken vp, with selfe loue, or with do∣ting & corrupt partial loue, and thence it is that they either altogither neglect the doing of good duties to their bre∣thren, or they do them coldlie, & faintly, or in sinister and by respects. We must therefore labour to haue our hearts seized & possessed with a zeale, & with a burning affection of loue to our brethren, and that we erre not touching this point, but may both rightly conceaue this zeale, and be perswaded to the imbracing of it, being rightly conceiued, I will stand a while to shew. First, what this zeale is. Secondly, the sorts of it. Thirdly, how it is to be manifested. Fourthly, in whome it ought to be found. And then after some examination of our selues touch∣ing the same, I will vse some motiues to stirre vs vp, to put on and to expresse this holy affection. First, therefore knowe wee,What zeale is that zeale or burning loue towards our brethren, is a feruency of spirit, arising of a mixture of loue and anger, for zeale, is a mixt affection, causing men to seeke the good of their brethren, and moo∣uing them to indignation and griefe, when any thinge is done to the hurt of their brethren, or that may hinder their good: And this feruencie of spirit, causing men thus to doo, is twofould, either according to knowledge, and guided by the word of God, or it is blinde,2. sorts of zeale. and not accor∣ding to knowledge, as was that of Paul before his conuer∣sion; Phill. 3.6. concerning zeale, I persecuted the church.
Now thirdly, touching the manifestation of this feruen∣cie of spirit, causing men to do as hath beene said, it is to be manifested two waies.Zeale is to be manifested two waies. First, by doing good according to the abilitie and the meanes we are able to vse, to the soules of our brethren, by instructing, by councelling, and by comforting them, or by praying for them, thus did Epaphras in this place he had a zeale toward the Colossians, and he made it knowne by striuing in praiers for them, thus did Paul as wee haue seene in the places before cited. Secondly, by remouing or turning away, or at least en∣deauouring to turne away euill, as wee are able from the soules of our brethren, by shewing our holy anger and in∣dignation against their sinnes, by admonition, by reprofe, or by correction, as iust occasion is offered. Thus did Moses after the children of Israell had committed that foule sinne in worshipping the golden calfe, manifest his zeale, both in respect of Gods glory, and towards the peo∣ple, by his holy anger, and indignation against them for that sinne, He (as we finde Exod. 32.20.) tooke the calfe which they had made, and burned it in the fire, & ground it vnto powder, and strawed it vpon the water, and made the children of Israell drinke of it,Zeale ought to be found in all, but especi∣ally in publike persons and such as haue the gouern∣ment of o∣thers. And hee sharpely re∣proued Aaron verse 21. what did this people vnto thee that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them? Now in the fourth place for the persons in whom this zeale to our brethren ought to be found; We must know, that it ought to be found in all, but especially in magistrates, in ministers, and such as haue any way the gouernment of others, as heere we see it was in Epaphras a minister, and so in Moses, in Paul and such like publique persons, so then the summe of all that hath beene said touching zeale to our brethren is this. All men, but especially magistrates, mini∣sters, and such as haue the gouernment of others, are to haue their hearts seized with a
feruency of spirit, arising of a mixture of loue, and anger, causing them according to the direction of the word of God, to seeke the good of their brethren, and moouing them to indignation and griefe, when any thing is done to the hurt of their brethren, and they are to manifest that feruencie of spirit by doing what good they are able to the soules of their brethren, by instruction, by counsell, by comfort, and by praiers, and (as they are able) to remoue and turne a∣way, or at least endeauour to turne away e∣uill from their brethren, by shewing ho∣ly anger against their sinnes, by admonition by reproofe, or by correction, as iust occasi∣on is offered. This is that zeale and that burning affection of loue that we are to haue our hearts possessed with all, and especially magistrates, and ministers, and such as haue the gouern∣ment of others, and this are they to manifest it to their brethren.Reproofe of such as want zeale to their brethren. And now if we do examine our selues touch∣ing this holy affection of zeale to our brethren, where, al∣most, is it to be found, where, almost is that man that hath the gouernment of others in any kinde, that magistrate, that master of a familie, or the like, that hath in him a fer∣uency of spirit, causing him to seeke the good of the soules of those that are vnder him, shewing it foorth by instruction, by good counsell, by comfort, by feruent praier, and moouing him to indignation and griefe for their sinnes, manifesting that by holy anger, by admoni∣tion, by reproofe, by correction as iust occasion is offered? do not many masters and gouernors, not onely neglect these good duties, to those that be vnder them, but many times euen countenance them in their sinnes? doe they not many times stand by their children, and seruants, and heare them raile, curse, and sweare, and many waies mis∣demeane
themselues, and yet shew foorth no manner of griefe, and indignation, nor dislike for the same. Do they not suffer them to breake the sabboth without controle∣ment? yea sometimes such as haue the gouernment of o∣thers stand by them in the open streetes, when they are at their sports, and vanities, and looke on them, and neuer open their mouthes to reprooue them. This is for want of zeale to our brethren, wee haue not our hearts possessed with that burning loue towards them that ought to be in vs, and therefore in a word, or two, to stirre vs vp to labour after this zeale, and this burning loue towards our bre∣thren,Two motues to stirre vs vp to labour af∣ter zeale, and burning loue towards our brethren. and especially such as are vnder our gouernment, consider first of all that if thou haue not a zeale in thine  heart towards thy brethren thou shalt neuer doe good du∣ties to them carefully, and conscionably, and if thou doe them not carefully, and conscionably, the doing of them is not pleasing to the Lord, for it is not the good dutie done, that is pleasing to him, vnlesse it bee done in truth, and sinceritie of heart, and affection; And in all good du∣ties done, he lookes rather to the affection of the doer then to the deede done. Againe consider this, if thou haue not in thee a zeale towards thy brethren, and especially towards such as bee vnder thy charge, thou hast not any true zeale to Gods glo∣ry; his glory is not deare vnto thee, for certainely as ma∣ny as haue zeale to the glory of God, they haue also a zeale, and burning loue to their brethren, and they desire that God may be glorified by others, as well as by them∣selues, and they are grieued when God is dishonored, when they heare or see him dishonored by any and espe∣cially by those that be vnder their charge. If then thou wouldest do good duties to thy brethren, and especially to those that are vnder thy charge carefully, and conscionably, and so as they may bee pleasing to God. And if thou wouldest make it cleare, that thou hast a
zeale to Gods glory, and that his glory is deare vnto thee, (which indeed ought to be more precious and deare vnto thee, then thine owne saluation.) Then labour thou to put on zeale and burning loue to thy brethren, and especially to those that bee vnder thy charge, neuer rest till thou finde in thee a feruencie of spi∣rit, euen a mixture of loue and anger, causing thee (accor∣ding to knowledge) to seeke the good of their soules, by all good meanes, and moouing thee to an holy indigna∣tion and griefe, when any thing is done, that may be to the hurt of their soules. In the next place, we are to marke the Apostles amplifi∣cation of Epaphras his zeale, by the measure and extent of it, that it was a great zeale, extended to the Colossians, and to them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. Hence note we (in a word.) That sometimes the children of God haue in them  (though not a perfect) yet a great measure of zeale,Gods chil∣dren haue somtimes in them a great measure of zeale and bur∣ning loue to their bre∣thren. and burning loue to their brethren, and that extended to ma∣ny of their brethren, for (as the Apostle Peter saith, 1 Pet: 1.22.) The children of God haue their soules purified in obeying the truth through the Spirit, to loue brotherly without faining, so as sometimes they come to loue one another with a pure heart feruently. They haue not onely that grace of true loue to the bre∣thren begun in them, but they many times feele it feruent, and hot within them. Now then, this being so, that the children of God, many  time haue in them, a great measure of loue, euen a zeale, and burning loue to their brethren, that opinion of the Pa∣pists must needs fall to the ground, that men cannot know whether they haue grace in them or no,That popish opinion con∣futed, that men cannot know whe∣ther they haue grace or no. for so they hold, when they are pressed with it, that a beleeuer may bee assured of his saluation by the testimonie of the Spirit, and by grace wrought in him: they answer, that a man cannot know whether he haue faith and grace in him or no. This
opinion of theirs cannot stand with the truth now deliue∣red, that the children of God haue many times that grace of true loue to their brethren in a great measure, and a bur∣ning loue vnto them: for can a liuing man haue fire in his naked bosome, and not feele it warme? no more can a man haue a zeale, and burning loue to his brethren in his heart, and not feele the heat of it, it is not possible, and therefore it is but a fancie, that a man may haue grace in his heart, and not feele it. Againe, is it so, that the children of God haue many times euen a zeale and burning loue to their brethren? let this then lead vs to a consideration of the greatnesse of Gods loue to his children:The great zeale that is found in Gods chil∣dren ought to lead vs to a consideration of Gods great loue to his children. for why is there sometimes in men, that are compassed with many infirmities, and haue in them such dregs of corruption, so long as they are in this life, such a measure of loue to their brethren, as their loue is a zealous and burning loue; how exceeding great then is the loue of God to his children, who is the perfe∣ction of loue, euen loue it selfe, 1 Ioh. 4.5. his loue to his children far exceeds the loue of the best men in the world, euen as farre as God himselfe excelleth dust, and earth, sin, and corruption. A sweet comfort, and let it bee laid vp in the hearts of all Gods children: hast thou an assurance of Gods loue shed abroad in thine heart?Note. then comfort thy selfe, his zeale, his burning loue to his children, is like to himselfe, infi∣nite, and vnchangeable: it was the ground of sending Christ, as the Prophet saith, Isai: 9.7. the zeale of the Lord of hostes will performe this. And the Lord hauing once lo∣ued thee, his loue will neuer faile thee, but vndoubtedly bring thee to eternall happinesse and blisse. One thing further wee are to marke, the Apostle doth not barely affirme it, that Epaphras had a great zeale to the Colossians, &c. but he confirmes it by his own testimonie: and to the end they might be fully perswaded of it, hee saith, I beare him record, or witnesse, that he hath a great zeale
for you, and for them of Laodicea, and them of Hierapolis. The point hence arising is this. That we are to witnesse the good things, and the good  graces that are in our brethren, when our witnesse and te∣stimonie may do any good,Wee are to witnesse the good things and graces that are in our brethren, when our witnesse may do any good. when our witnesse may bee to Gods glory, to the praise of his gifts, or may winne more credit to their grace and gifts, that they may be more able to do more good by them. Thus did the Apostle in this place; and thus did our Sauiour giue testimonie to Iohn, Mat: 11.11. Verily I say vnto you, among them which are begotten of women, arose there not a greater then Iohn Baptist: thus are we to doe, only re∣membring this rule. That wee witnesse the good things that are in our bre∣thren,When we are to witnes the good things that are in our brethren. and speake of them rather in their absence, then in their presence, vnlesse in case of extreame deiection of minde, otherwise we are rather to speake of them in their absence, then in their presence: for though wee witnes the truth, yet our testimonie in the hearing of our brethren themselues, may seeme rather to sauour of flattery, then of any good liking of those good things, and (thorow the corruption of nature) it may be an occasion of making the party proud, and highly conceited of himselfe. Come we to the 14th verse. VER. 14. Luke the beloued Physitian greeteth you, and Demas. In this Verse the Apostle doth further manifest and de∣clare the loue of two other men, that were with him, to∣wards the Colossians, namely, of Luke and of Demas, that they also sent greeting and salutations to them: and the first of these he sets out ouer and besides his name, by his particular calling and profession, that he was a Physitian,
to which is added an epithite, or adiunct of further com∣mendation, (beloued) that hee was a beloued Physitian, Luke the beloued Physitian greeteth you. and Demas he only names, without adding any further title of commenda∣tion to him. Who this Luke was, it is doubtfull, and some thinke it was Luke the Euangelist that writ the gospell, and the Acts of the Apostles; others thinke it was not he, but some other man of that name,Interpre∣tation. to which opinion I rather incline, because in all likelyhood, if it had been Luke the Euange∣list, the Apostle would rather haue giuen him that title, then the title of Physitian, that being a more excellent ti∣tle, and of greater honour and dignitie. And againe, the Apostle speaking of him, 2 Tim: 4.11. he only names him without addition of Euangelist; that which they (who hold him to be Luke the Euangelist) doe alledge for their proofe out of Philem: epist: vers. 24. that he was Pauls fel∣low helper, is not of sufficient weight to prooue it: for some were his fellow helpers, that were no Euangelists, nor Ministers, as appeares Rom: 16.3. Aquila and Pris∣cilla tent-makers, were his fellow helpers: but who this Luke was, it is not much materiall: they that hold him to be the Euangelist, say also that he was a Physitian, one that had skill in that facultie of Physicke, and in curing bodily diseases, and therefore without further inquirie wee may keepe to this title Phisitian, heere giuen him by the A∣postle. Luke the Physitian] The Apostle addes (beloued.) The originall text runnes thus: Luke the Physitian that beloued: the meaning i, Luke the Physitian beloued of God, and for his pietie, religion, and christian cariage in his calling, singularly beloued of me, and of all true Christians that knew him. (and Demas.) This Demas was he (no doubt) of whom afterwards the Apostle complained, 2 Tim: 4.10. that hee had forsaken him and embraced this present world: wee need not further stand vpon these words tou∣ching
the meaning of them. Now in that the Apostle sets out Luke by his particular calling and profession, that hee was a Physitian, (not to inquire, why it was, that Paul had a Physitian in his com∣panie, I hold that a needlesse thing,) wee haue a manifest allowance giuen to physicke, and to Physitians. That to be a professed Physitian, one that hath skill to  cure the bodily diseases of men, is an approoued facultie,It is a lawfull and commen¦dable course of life to be a professed Physitian. and a lawfull and commendable course of life, otherwise the Apostle would neuer haue commended Luke, by this terme (Physitian,) if to be of that profession, were not law∣full, and very profitable, and comfortable vnto the sonnes of men; but further to prooue this, we finde that the spi∣rit of God hath giuen approbation of Physicke in other places of Scripture. Ierem: 8.21. the Prophet bewayling the hurt of the people, euen the misery that was to come on them for their sinnes, hee wisheth vers. 22. that their hurt might be healed, and hee sets downe his wish by way of expostulation, in metaphoricall termes, taken from balme, which is precious for curing of hurts and wounds, whereof there was great store in Gilead, as appeares Gen: 37.25. and from Physitians, saith he, Is there no balme in Gilead? is there no Physitian there? and Iob 13.4. Iob com∣pares his friends to vnskilfull Physitians: saith he, all you are Physitians of no value. In that parable, Luk: 10 34. it is said of the Samaritane, by way of commendation, that he bound vp, and powred in oyle and wine into the wounds, of the man that lay wounded between Ierusalem and Ie¦richo, which (indeed) was a practise of Physick: for wine serues to cleanse, and to ease the paine within, and oyle to mollifie the flesh, and to allay the paine without: to which the Prophet alludes, Isai: 1.6. they haue not been wrapped nor bound vp, nor mollified with oyle. but most pregnant for proofe of the point in hand, is that speech of our Sauiour▪ comparing himselfe to a Physitian, Mat: 9 11. saith hee The whole need not a Physitian, but they that are sicke. In
which comparison, he shewes plainly, that there is some∣times necessarie and good vse of the Physitian for the bo∣dy, and therefore his calling is lawfull and commen∣dable. And the reason of this is euident, namely this, the Lord hath put many excellent qualities and vertues into herbes, and other creatures, seruing for the cure of diseases, and for the preseruation and restoring of health to the bodie of man, which are hidden and vnknowne, till they be found out by study and obseruation, and there is almost an infi∣nite number of diseases that befall the bodie of man; the bodie of man is subiect almost to innumerable diseases, which men of other trades and callings, in regard of im∣ploiments, cannot know by their names, much lesse can they know the causes, and nature of them; and therefore it is needfull that some men set themselues apart to study the Art of Phisicke, that they may know the vertues of hearbes, and other things, that serue for Medicine, and may bee able wisely to applie them, either simply, or in composition, and that they may know the naturall causes of diseases, their continuall or intermitting courses, their, simptomes, and crisis, the state and constitutions of mens bodies, and may vse medicines, either to preuent, or to re∣moue diseases accordingly, and so the skill of Physick be∣ing of such excellent vse, it must needes follow, that the profession of that facultie is a lawfull and commendable course of life. And therefore for vse of this; First it must teach vs to esteeme of good and wholesome Physicke, as a blessing of God, and of needfull vse at somtimes,Good and wholesome Physicke is to be esteemed as a blessing of God and of needfull vse at sometimes. and not (as the fa∣shion of some is) to contemne it as a thing altogether needlesse, and vnprofitable; some are so willfully auerse in this kinde, as sometimes they sticke not to say, they will rather die then take Phisicke: but let such know, they are guilty of the neglect of an excellent ordinance of God, and a meanes that he hath appointed for the preseruation
of health, and life, which we are bound to preserue, by all possible good meanes;Note. for this temporarie life is a preci∣ous iewell, it is giuen vs that in it wee might vse all good meanes to attaine to life and saluation, it is the time of grace and saluation, and as the Preacher saith, Eccles. 9.4. Whosoeuer is ioined to all the liuing hath hope, for it is better to be a liuing Dogge, then a dead Lion. And if a man die in his sinnes, all hope of repentance is gone, and hee cannot re∣deeme it with the price of a thousand worlds. That which some vse to obiect against the vse of Phy∣sicke, is not worth answering That some who vse Physicke are not better for it, but many times the worse,  and therefore they will vse none at all. For by the same reason they might reiect the vse of meat and drinke. Doe not we see that some thriue not, but euen pine a∣way in the midst of plentie,  and variety of wholesome meats and drinkes? Common experience shewes it, shall any thereupon wilfully refuse the vse of meat and drinke? No, no, euery man may see that is but a foolish cauill, and the cause is like in the vse of Physicke; wee are therefore to esteeme Physicke as a good meanes the Lord hath ap∣pointed for the recouerie of health, in time of sicknes, and to vse it in time of neede carefully, and with good consci∣ence, leauing the issue and blessing to the Lord. And that wee may vse Phisicke with a good conscience and looke for a blessing on it;Three things to be remem∣bred in the vse of Physicke. Three things must bee re∣membred. 1 First, that the medicines wee vse be lawfull, such as haue in them a naturall power and vertue to cure a bodily disease, not charmes, or spels, or amulets, and the like, which haue no power, either by creation, or by any ordi∣nance of God to that purpose. 2 Secondly, that wee vse good medicines, onely as meanes, not trusting in them as able to doe vs any good
of themselues, without Gods blessing on them; king Asa commended in Scripture for many other things, is yet blamed for this, 2 Chron. 16.12. That hee trusted to the Physitions. 3 And thirdly, that we vse good Physicke and medi∣cines, with praier, euer calling vpon God, for the pardon of our sinnes, yea rather desiring the pardon of our sinnes, then the release of our paine, and intreating the Lord for a blessing vnto our Physicke, for the remouing of our di∣sease, and the restoring of health vnto vs, if it be his good will and pleasure, and if thus wee vse Physicke in time of need, we shall finde it profitable, and comfortable, and a meanes of restoring health to vs, if the Lord see it meete for his glorie, and our good. And for further vse of this point, is it so, that whole∣some Physicke, for the body is a thing of excellent vse, and so to be esteemed of vs? Surely, then much more are we to esteeme of the physicke for our soules,We are more to esteeme of the physicke for our soules, then of the physicke for our bodies. of that phy∣sicke and those medicines that serue for the curing of the maladies, and diseases of our soules, and as euery one is, or ought to be a Phisitian for his own body, so much more for his owne soule. Few are skil∣full Physitians for their soules.But alas, I must needes heere breake out into a com∣plaint; Few there be that haue any vnderstanding or skill, what thing is good for the healing of the infirmities and diseases of their soules, and (which is worse) most haue little or no care to learne or remember such things, when they are told them, euery one almost knows what is good for his body, euery one almost can say, oh, I haue an hot liuer, or a cold stomacke, a moist braine, or I am troubled with winde, and such like, and this is good for mee, and that is hurtfull, and this I will vse, and that I will forbeare; yea, if wee heare it but once from the mouth of another, this is good for you, or that is hurtfull in regard of your infirmitie, or disease, we euer after that remember it, and we can say, I heard such an one tell mee once, it may bee
20. or 30. yeeres agoe, this is good for mee, and therefore this I will vse, this is hurtfull for mee, and therefore I will forbeare it. This I speake not against, this is lawfull, but let this shame vs in regard of our ignorance and vnskilful∣nesse, and want of remembrance, touching things that are good against the infirmites, and diseases of our soules, we seldome or neuer say, oh I haue a windy minde, a mind full of nothing but ignorance, and vanitie, my heart is much troubled with the lust of vncleanenesse, of pride, of couetousnesse, and such like; this is good for mee, and this I will vse, and that is euill and hurtfull for mee, and I will refuse and auoide it. Nay, let a man tell vs many times ouer, what is good against the particular infirmitie, or disease whereof our soules doe chiefely labour, and we either take no notice of it, or we remember it not. For example, let vs heare and that often, that a due con¦sideration of the insufficiency of riches in themselues to doe vs good, that our excessiue desire of them being satis∣fied, hath the curse of God attending on it, and that con∣tentation, and the like, are meanes to cure that lust of co∣uetousnesse that is in vs. Let vs be told that a serious consideration of our owne vilenesse and sinne, a due consideration of Gods proui∣dence that nothing befalles vs but by his hand, that frequent and earnest praier, and the like, are speciall means to be vsed against the violent affection of iniust anger that takes place in vs, and we either take no knowledge of these things, or we remember them not. Thou wilt say, alas my memory is weake,  and I cannot remember them. Canst thou remember a thing once told thee for the good of thy body,  and not that which is often repeated for the good of thy soule? blame not thy memory, there is another thing in thee blame-worthy, and that is this, thou sauourest the things of the flesh, and thy whole study and care is for the good of thy body, and thou hast little
or no care for the good of thy soule: and hence it is that thou dost take notice, and remember things told thee for the good of thy body, though thou heare them but once, and not things often spoken for the good of thy soule. Well, art thou able to see and discerne the particular in∣firmity of thy body? Dost thou know and remember it once told thee, what is good, or what is hurtfull in regard of that infirmity? And dost thou vse the one and forbeare the other accordingly? Oh then let this shame thee if thou be ignorant, or vnskilfull touching the infirmitie of thy soule, or remembring not things often told thee that are good against the same, and for the curing of that infir∣firmity, as thou art a Physitian in some sort for thine own body, which is commendable; so much more bee thou a Physician for thy soule, spie out the disease of thy soule, and if thou knowest the speciall infirmitie, or diseases of thy soule, be it one, or more, labour also to know what may serue for the cure of it, and if once thou heare of that which may doe thee good for that disease, lay it vp, and remember it, and make vse of it, as occasion is offered. And in as much as thy soule is farre more excellent then thy body, so haue thou a greater care of the health and soundnesse of that, then of thy bodie. The Apostle addes (beloued) signifying that Luke was such a Physician, as for his pietie, and religion, and for his  Christian carriage in his calling, was singularly beloued of the Apostle,We are so to carrie our selues in our particular cal∣lings, as wee may iustly gaine loue from them with whom we haue to deale. and of all true beleeuers that knew him. I spoke of this Epithite before, verse 7. I will only adde thus much in a word. That according to the example of Luke we are to carry our selues in our personal and particular calling as we may iustly gaine loue from those, with whom we haue to deale, that we may iustly and truely bee called (being Physicians) beloued Physicians, being Marchants, beloued Marchants and such like, and that wee may so doe, wee must looke
that in the practise of the workes of our places and cal∣lings there bea practise of holinesse and loue, that wee shew foorth holinesse towards God, and loue to our bre∣thren,How this may be done. in the practise of the workes of our particular cal∣lings, and that we be such as in the workes of our particu∣lar calling, seeke not our selues, our own profits and com∣modities, but the glory of God, and good of our brethren, and that we by loue serue our brethren, as it is Gal. 5.13. And if wee so doe, wee shall (doubtlesse) winne the loue of our brethren, and finde comfort in our owne hearts. In the last place obserue we, that the Apostle concludes with Demas, that he also sent salutations to the Colossians, and hee onely names him, and sets no marke of honour vpon him; And whence was this? Surely the holy Ghost whose pen-man the Apostle was, seeing the hollownesse and hypocrisie of Demas, which afterwards brake out, and appeared in forsaking Paul, and imbracing this present world, would not vouchsafe him any title of commenda∣tion, though hee deceiued men, who made account of him in regard of the good profession he made for a time, and he was a companion to the Apostle, yet hee could not deceiue the holy Ghost, he saw his hollow heart and there∣fore, would not giue him any title of honour, more then this, that hee sent salutations to the Colossians, which a wretched worldling may easily doe. Hence we may gather. That howsoeuer dissembling hypocrites, may deceiue  men, and euen good men may make account of them,Though dis∣sembling hy∣pocrites may deceiue good men, yet they cannot de∣ceiue the Lord. in regard of their outward profession, and admit them to be their companions, as Paul did Demas, yet they cannot deceiue the Lord, the Lord sees the deceit and hollow∣nesse of their hearts, and though men make account of them, yet the Lord vouchsafes them no regard at all; no, though they eate and drinke in his presence, though they come to the Table of the Lord, and heare him speake vn∣to
them in his word, and seeme to make an excellent pro∣fession, and goe so farre in that profession, and come to knocke at heauen gates, and men cannot discerne them, yet the Lord all that while sees them to be but hypocrites, and hath no respect vnto them, and will then tell them, he knowes them not whence they are, and say, Depart from me yee workers of iniquitie, Luk. 13.26.27. If then thou be a professor of religion, looke thou to the soundnesse of thy profession,Professors of Religion are to looke to the soundnes of their pro∣fession. thinke it not sufficient to come to the hearing of the word, and to the Table of the Lord, and to make a faire outward shew of religion, but looke there be soundnesse of religion in thine heart; for a∣las, what will it auaile thee to make a goodly shew of Re∣lgion, and to bee highly esteemed for it among men, yea amongst good men, when notwithstanding the Lord sees thee to be a dissembling hypocrite, and hath no regard vn∣to the? Remember this, thou maiest in a seeming shew of Religion goe so farre as to knocke at heauen gates, and challenge the Lord to let thee in, and yet the Lord see thee to be but an hypocrite, and then be dismissed, and sent a∣way with a Nscio, I know thee not, depart from mee thou worker of iniquitie; therefore as thou dost tender the good of thine own soule, looke to to the soundnesse of thine heart,Note. that religion be soundly rooted in thine heart, and that thou maiest with good conscience appeale to the Lord, as Dauid did, Psalm. 139.1. and as Ieremiah did Ierem. 12.3. and honour the Lord in thine heart as they did, and then (doubtlesse) the Lord will honor thee, he will vouchsafe thee honour and good estimation in the world, at least in the hearts of his children, and of his mercy he will crowne thee after this life is ended, with e∣uerlasting honour in the kindome of heauen.
VER. 15. Salute the brethren which are of Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the Church which is in his house. In this verse the Apostle comes to the third branch of his conclusion, which is laid downe in the 15.16. and 17.The third branch of the Apostles con∣clusion. verses, and it containes a setting downe of some speciall things which he willed the Colossians to do, and that they should cause to be done, both to the Church of Laodicea, and to some particular persons. In this verse hee wisheth the Colossians to salute from him their neighbors, them of Laodicea, whom he stiles by the name of brethren, (Salute the brethren which are of Lao∣dicea) and then more specially, one Nymphas, together with those that were in his house whom hee doth honour and dignifie with the title of a Church, (and the Church which is in his house.) Let vs first cleare the words touching the sense and meaning of them. (Salute the brethren.) The word (brethren) in Scripture hath diuers accepti∣ons,Interpreta∣tion. sometimes it signifies such as are children of the same wombe, brethren by nature, as Iacob and Esau were; some times men of the same bloud, as Abraham and Lot, Genes. 13.8. sometimes men of the same Countrey, thus Sauls countrey-men are called his brethren, 2. Chr. 12.2, some∣times men of the same religion. And thus the word (bre∣thren) is vsually taken in the new Testament, for such as being conuerted to the true faith of Christ, made open profession of that truth, and so it is heere to bee taken. (Salute the brethren which are of Laodicea) that is, salute those at Laodicea which are conuerted to the true faith, and make open profession of the faith, and Gospell of Christ, (and Nymphas more specially, and the Church which
is in his house.) Some by Church in Nymphas his house, vnderstand a Congregation, or an assembly of Christians, which (say they) it may seeme, vsed to meete together in his house, to performe holy exercises of Religion, but (as I take it) that is not the meaning of the Apostle, so much being before implied in the word (brethren) euen all the Christians generally that were in Laodicea, but by the Church in the house of Nymphas we are to vnderstand his Christian family, which was so well instructed in the true faith of the Gospell, and so godly and religious as for the pietie and good order obserued in that familie, there be∣ing the word read, instruction, consolation, praier, sing∣ing of Psalmes, and such like holy exercises vsed, it was like to a little visible Church, or Congregation, in which there be professors of true Religion, worshipping God in Christ according to his word, in the exercises of Religion. Thus then are the words of this verse to bee conceiued, as if the Apostle had said. Salute in my name, or from me your neighbours, those at Laodicea, who being conuerted to the faith of the Gospell make open profession of the same, and more specially Nymphas, and his Chri∣stian family, which for the pietie and good order obserued in the same, in the vse of holy exercises, is, euen as a little visible Church, or congregati∣on, in which there be professors of true religion, worshipping God according to his word in the exercises of religion. Come we now to such instructions as this verse doth further offer vnto vs; and first in that the Apostle sent sa∣lutations from himselfe to them of Laodicea, which was a token and testimonie of his loue towards them, and yet he had neuer seen them, as appeares cap: 2.1. onely note with me, this in a word.
That wee are to loue euen those Christians wee neuer  saw, and to testifie and make knowne our loue to them by all good meanesWee are to loue those Christians we neuer saw, and to testifie our loue vnto them by all good means. vpon any iust occasion that is offered. For why? they are members with vs of the same body, and they are conioyned with vs by the same Spirit, euen by the Spirit of Christ: and therefore wee ought to loue them, though we haue neuer seen them, face to face, and to testifie our loue by salutations, prayers, and the like, as any iust occasion is offered. And if thou haue not a loue to the members of Christ,  wheresoeuer they be scattered on the face of the earth, and if thou do not shew it forth by praying for them, as for thy seife, and for thine owne familiar friends, and by other good meanes, it is an euidence and token thou art not a liuely member of that body of Christ,Such as want loue to the members of Christ where∣soeuer they be, cannot as yet assure themselues to be mem∣bers of the body of Christ. as yet. This point I haue heretofore handled, and therfore let it serue to haue pointed at it in a word. In the next place, we are to marke, that the Apostle sa∣luting them of Laodicea, that were professors of the true faith of Christ, he calls them brethren. Whence wee are taught thus much. That professors of the same true roligion are in as neere  relation one to another as naturall brethren,Professors of the same true religion are to hold them∣selues as bre∣thren one to another, and to loue one another as brethren, euen heartily and mutually. and are to be affected one to another, and to loue one another, as bre∣thren, such as professe the same true religion, are to hold themselues as brethren one to another, and to loue as bre∣thren, that is, to loue one another heartily and mutually, for so do naturall brethren, vnlesse they degenerate and grow out of kinde; Wee finde it often in Scripture, that the professors of the same true faith, are stiled by the name of brethren, and stirred vp to hearty and mutuall loue, vn∣der the title of brethren, as Rom: 12.10. Be affectioned to loue another with brotherly loue. 1 Pet: 3.8. Loue as brethren. It is a knowne point (no doubt) in speculation, wee haue many times had occasion to speake of it, and therefore I will be briefe in it: and the ground of it is also (doubtlesse)
well knowne to vs, it being the same with the ground of the loue of naturall brethren,  (namely) a coniunction and partaking in the same substance, seede, nourishment, &c. that as naturall brethren comming of one line, ha∣uing one father and mother, one bread to feed on, are mooued by the teaching of nature to loue one another: so true beleeuing Christians, hauing the same God for their Father, the same Church for their Mother, Christ their elder Brother, being begotten of the same mortall seed, nourished with the same milke of the word, eating the same bread of the Sacrament, and looking for the same blessed inheritance, must needs by the teaching and worke of the Spirit be mooued to loue one another, as brethren, euen hartily and mutually. And let this be thought vpon. We all professe the same true faith and religion, and in that respect we are brethrē, & let vs be stird vp to loue one another, heartily and mutually, as brethren:We that pro∣fesse the same true faith, are to remember that in that respect we are brethren, and are to loue one another as brethren. and remem∣ber that besides this, that brotherly loue is the badge and cognizance of our profession, by this shall all men know that yee are my disciples, if yee haue loue one to another, Ioh: 13.35. and is an vndoubted pledge of our owne saluation, 1 Ioh: 3.14. that brotherly loue is a thing, not onely taught out∣wardly by precept, but inwardly taught and implanted in the hearts of all true beleeuers by the spirit of God, as the Apostle saith plainly, 1 Thess. 4.9. touching brotherly loue yee need not that I write vnto you. why so? for yee are taught of God to loue one another; as if he had said, as naturall brethren (not degenerating and growing out of kinde) are taught by nature to loue on nother: so you to whom God hath giuen his holy Spirit, are taught by the spirit of God to loue one another. Deadly ha∣tred of our brethren, and the suits of it, are the de¦ulls lessons.Now then hence reason thus with thy selfe; is brother∣ly loue, a lesson taught by the spirit of God? who then is the teacher of deadly hatred? who puts into me swelling, and heart-burning against my brethren? who fills my mouth with bitter and venemous speeches against them?
are these lessons taught by Gods spirit? no, no, hee is the God of peace and loue, and these are the teachings of ano∣ther spirit, euen of that infernall spirit, the author of con∣fusion, the sower of all dissention among brethren, these are the teachings of the Deuill himselfe: thinke on this, whosoeuer thou art, that hast thine heart filled with poy∣son, euen full of hatred and malice, and thy tongue bent to shoot out arrowes, euen bitter words against thy bre∣thren, thou art so taught by the Deuill himself, he is thy in∣structer, & he is thy teacher: as many as are true beleeuers, haue learned another lesson, that they are taught of God to loue their brethren heartily and mutually. And if thou haue not learned that lesson, thou art not taught of the Spirit of God: and if thou be not taught of Gods spirit, surely thou hast not his spirit, and if thou haue not his spi∣rit, thou art none of his. Let this then stirre vp euery one of vs, seeing wee pro∣fesse the same true faith and religion, and so are brethren, to loue one another with brotherly loue, that so wee may haue testimonie to the comfort of our owne soules, that we (indeed) are true professors, knit together by one spi∣rit, euen the Spirit of God, and guided by the Spirit of God. Now further obserue wee, that the Apostle hauing sent salutations to all the brethren in Laodicea generally, hee salutes Nymphas and his house particularly: Nymphas ex∣celling others in pietie and religion, is preferd by the holy ghost before the rest, and had in speciall remembrance by the Apostle: salute the brethren whch are of Laodicea, and especially Nymphas, and his godly familie. Whence we are giuen to vnderstand. That they that honour God, shall be honoured of him:Note. yea they, according to the degree of honour which they giue to the Lord, shall be honoured of him: if any surpasse others in honouring the Lord, the Lord will also honour him aboue his fellowes. but on that I will not stand.
Let vs rather consider the duty arising from hence, namely this. That we ought to honour men more or lesse, according as they honour God,We are to ho∣nour men more or lesse, according as they honour God. as the Apostle did heere in particu∣lar salute Nymphas, he excelling others in pietie, and there∣by manifest a speciall regard and estimation that hee had of him. So ought wee to carry in our hearts a more speciall re∣gard of those that excell others in pietie and religion, and more especially to honour them, that aboue others, doe honour and feare the Lord. Psal. 15.4 it is made a note of him that shall dwell in the Lords tabernacle, that hee honoureth them that feare the Lord. and Psal: 16.3. Dauid saith, his delight was in the Saints that were in the earth, and chiefly in the excellnt, in those that did excell others in grace and holinesse; the reasons of this duty are ma∣nifest. First, we are to carry in our hearts a reuerent estimation of the image of God renued in any whosoeuer, and accor∣ding to the renouation of that image more or lesse in a measure of holinesse, are wee more or lesse to honour them that are so renued: now such as excell others in pie∣tie and religion, and in the feare of God, are (doubtlesse) more renued according to Gods image, and therefore in more speciall manner are to be honoured of vs. Againe, such as excell others in pietie and religion, are in more speciall fauour and regard with the Lord, and therefore are more to be esteemed of vs: as amongst men, those are most honoured, that are in greatest fauour with the Prince, so ought we to honour them most, that are in greatest fauour with the Lord. And therefore, (to make vse of this) dost thou honour one man aboue another? dost thou carry in thine heart a more speciall regard of one aboue another? no doubt euery one doth so, when they compare man with man: looke then it bee according to the duty now laid before
thee, euen in respect of this, that he excells others in piety and religion. Doe not thou according to the common course of the world, honour and esteeme one man better then another,  in regard of his wealth or outward estate,In honouring one man a∣boue another, not wealth or outward estate, but pietie and re∣ligion are to be respected. because hee is more wealthy, or of better estate in the world then others, that is not the rule, by which thou art to be guided in the preferring and honouring of one man aboue another; no, no, looke to his piety and religion, and to the infalli∣ble tokens of Gods feare in his heart, and according to them, let him haue place of honour and estimation in thine heart, and he that excells others in piety and reli∣gion, let him be the man thou doest honour and esteeme aboue others, yea though it be in an vnequall comparison, in respect of outward condition: as happily one is a Ma∣gistrate, and another a priuate person,Note. if the priuate per∣son excell the Magistrate in pietie and religion, let him haue the chiefe place of honour in thine heart. Howsoe∣uer, indeed, thou art to reuerence the place and authority giuen vnto Magistrates, and to honour and respect it with all due reuerence and honour, and to submit thy selfe to it, euen to the shedding of thy bloud: yet in regard of piety and religion, a priuate person going before a Magi∣strate, let him in that respect, haue an higher place of ho∣nour in thine heart, then the Magistrate, and doe thou in honouring and preferring one man before another, in re∣gard of piety and religion, euer honour him most, that doth most honour God: and know for thy comfort, that that is a certaine euidence and proofe, that thou louest the honour of God, and that his honour is deare vnto thee, in that thou not onely honourest them that honour him, but thou dost honour them more or lesse according to the measure of honour which they yeeld to the Lord. Now further in that the Apostle calls the christian fami∣lie of Nymphas a Church, we see That a small number of the faithfull,Note. euen one familie may
carry the name of a Church. But on that I will not stand. Why did the Apostle call the family of Nymphas, a Church? it was because of the piety of that family, and the good order obserued in it, there being in it holy exer∣cises of religion constantly vsed, as reading the word, in∣struction, prayer, singing of Psalmes, and the like: and thereby the whole family framed to pietie and religion, therfore it was that the Apostle calld it a Church. Hence we are taught thus much. That a familie in which there is a constant vse of holy exercises, as reading the word, prayer, and the like, and the people of that familie thereby framed to holinesse and re∣ligion, is euen as a little visible Church:A familie wherein there is a constant vse of holy exercses, and the members of it thereby framd to ho∣linesse and re∣ligion, is as a ltle visible Church. the teaching and religious ordering of a familie, is so acceptable a thing to the Lord, as he esteemes of such an house, as an holy as∣sembly of his Saints. And hence it is, that not only heere, but in other places also, the holy ghost doth commend, and giue the title of a Church to particular families, Rom: 16.5. Greete the Church that is in their house. and 1 Cor: 16.19 Aquila and Priscilla with the Church that is in their house. so likewise Philem: verse 2. of that episte, is saluted with the Church in his house. See then how pleasing a thing it i to the Lord, when a familie is instructed, and religiously ordered, hee makes account of that familie, as of a litle visible Church and congregation. How then ought this to stir vp masters and gouernours of families, to practise that duty of teaching and religious ordering of their families,An excellent motiue to stir vp gouernours of families to a religious or∣dering of their families. for indeed it is the dutie of eue∣ry master and gouernour of a familie, to teach and to in∣struct his familie, and to pray with them in priuate, and not only to bring them to the publike assembly, and there to pray, and by all good meanes to frame them to holines and religion. And heere is an excellent motiue to stirre them vp to the practise of that duty; a familie instructed and religiously ordered, is esteemed of the Lord as a litle
visible Church and assembly of his Saints, and that is no small matter: for such a familie hath the blessing of God vpon it, and his speciall protection ouer it, for the blessing of God is euer annexed to his true worship and feare, God∣linesse hath the promises of this life and of that that is to come. 2 Tim: 4.8. Againe, consider what a familie not instructed and reli∣giously ordered is,What a fami∣lie is, wherein there is no re∣ligious order. surely, no better then a company of Atheists, for it is one property of the Atheist, not to call on God, Psal: 14.4. and we may see this true in common experience, looke into many familie not instructed and religously ordered, and what are they? like a litle Church? nay surely so farre out of order, as they are rather like to an hellish company, where the deuill himselfe sits as pre∣sident: there is nothing, but ignorance, worldlines, pride, wantonnesse, swearing, fighting, whoring, stealing, lying, and such like. And yet further to excite and stirre vp masters and go∣uernours of families to the instructing and religious orde∣ring of their families, consider what we finde Gen: 18.19.Another ex∣cellent mo∣tiue to stirre vp masters and gouer∣nors of fami∣lies, to order thir families religiously. the Lord saith, verse 17. Shall I hide from Abraham what thing I doe; as if hee had said: no, no, I will not hide any thing from Abraham, for I know him, that hee will com∣mand his sonnes and his houshold after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to doe righteousnesse and iudg∣ment. See how the Lord liketh the carefulnesse of ma∣sters and gouernous to instruct their families, it is so plea∣sing vnto him, as he will reueale his secrets to such as do it, and hide nothing from them that may be for their com∣fort. On the contrary, wee may gather, that from such as are carelesse of this duty, he will hide his secrets, his coun ells, and without repentance, his comforts, and the light of his countenance for euer. So then, if thou that art a master of a familie, dost desire that thy familie may not be a com∣pany of Atheists, among whom there is nothing but igno¦rance
and all impietie, but rather as a litle Church, and so esteemed of the Lord, hauing his blessing vpon it, and his speciall protection ouer it, and if thou desire that the Lord may not hide his councells from thee, but may reueale his secrets vnto thee, and hide nothing from thee, that may be for thy comfort. Then looke thou to the instruction and religious ordering of thy family, resolue with good Ioshua, Iosh: 24.15. whatsoeuer others do, yet thou and thine hou∣shold will serue the Lord; practise thou constantly the vse of holy exercises of religion, priuate reading, praying, and the like: and then (doubtlesse thou shalt finde, the Lord will esteeme of thy familie, as of a litle visible Church, and thou shalt finde his blessing vpon thee, and vpon thy fami∣lie, and the Lord will reueale and make knowne to thee, whatsoeuer may be for thy comfort. Now to the 16th verse. VER. 16. And when this Epistle is read of you, cause that it be read in the Church of the Laodi∣ceans also, and that yee likewise read the Epistle (written) from Laodicea. In this Verse, the Apostle goes on further, to inioyne two other things to be done by the Colossians, as First, that they should cause this Epistle written and di∣rected to them, to be read in the Church of Laodicea. And he tells them when they should so do, (namely) after themselues had read it: And when this epistle (saith he) is read of you, cause that it bee read in the Church of the Laodiceans also. Secondly, that they should in like sort, read the Epistle written from Laodicea: And that yee likewise read the Epi∣stle written from Laodicea. Touching the words of this verse, there is no great diffi∣cultie
to them, saue onely in the last words of it concer∣ning the Epistle witten from Laodicea. When this Epistle (that is) this letter, sent vnto you,Interpre∣tation. is read, cause it (that is) take order that it bee read (in the Church) that is, in the publicke assembly of the Laodi∣ceans. Now for that Epistle written from Laodicea there be di∣uers opinions; some thinke it was an Epistle written from Paul to the Laodiceans, and of this opinion are the Papists, but that cannot stand with the words of the Text, for the originall is  and , as it is rendred from Laodicea, not to Laodicea. Now whereas, they say, though it bee from, not to the Laodiceans, yet that phrase doth not signifie, that the Epi∣stle was written from Laodicea, but that the Colossians were to require and call for that Epistle from the Laodiceans, that it was an Epistle the Apostle had written vnto the Laodice∣ans, and the Colossians were to require it at their hands, is but a shift, a Glosse, and a needelesse adding to the Text. Some againe thinke, that the Epistle written from Lao∣dicea, was the first Epistle of Paul to Timothy, indeed that Epistle hath such a postscript, that it was written from La∣odicea, a chiefe Citie of Phrygia Pacaciana, but that post∣script is no part of Canonicall Scripture. And againe, it is cleare, Cap. 2.1. that when the Apostle writ this Epistle, he had not seene the Laodiceans, and therefore hee could not mention any Epistle of his written from thence, hee hauing neuer beene there. A third opinion is, that the Epistle here spoken of written from Laodicea, was an Epistle written to the Apostle, either from the whole Church of Laodicea, or from the Pastor of that Church; and (indeed) this opinion is most probable and most agreeable to the words of the Text, without any addition or forcing at all, and it seemes, that Epistle writ∣ten from Laodicea, was written to Paul touching some
things to which he makes answer in this Epistle to the Co∣lossians, and therefore he willed the Colossians to reade it, that they might the better vnderstand vpon what occasion he had written somethings contained in this Epistle to them: and so taking that to be the meaning, that the Epi∣stle written from Laodicea, was an Epistle, that either that whole Church, or the Pastor of that Church had written to Paul. Come we to such points of instrustion as this verse doth offer to vs. And first, obserue we, that the Apostle would haue his Epistle read both in the Church of the Colossians, and in the publike assembly of the Laodiceans, whence wee may easily see, I will but point at it. That we haue warrant for the reading of this, & other Epistles of Paul, and of all other books of Scripture, in the publike assemblyThe Epistles of Paul, and other bookes o Scripture may, and ought to bee read in the publike as∣embly. and congregation, we haue here a plaine allowance giuen to it, that ths Epistle, and other Epistles & other books of the Scripture, may be, & (indeed) ought to be publikely read, in the publike congregation, yea, the Church gouernours may, and ought to take order, that the bookes of holy Scripture be read in the publike mee∣tings of the people of God. And to this purpose the Apostle speaks more directly, and with farre greater vehemency, 1. Thess. 5.27. He there commands the gouernours of that Church in the name of the Lord to doe this dutie, yea, he bindes them to the do∣ing of it, vnder paine of Gods heauie displeasure, denoun∣cing his heauie wrath against them if they did it not (for so much the word signifies) I charge you, or I adiure you, n the name of the Lord, on paine of the Lords wrath, that this Epistle be read vnto all the brethren, the Saints, to all the Christians that are members of your Church, in their publike meeting, a charge full of power and Aposto∣licall authority, vrging the gouernours of that Church to the doing of this dutie.
Now, how crosse and contrarie to this, is the Church of  Rome, that Church, directly forbids the reading of the bookes of the Scripture among the people,The Papists iustly taxed in that they for∣bid the rea∣ding of the Scripture a∣mong the people. at least the rea∣ding of them in a knowne tongue, which is all one, they strictly inioine that no vulgar translation of Scripture bee vsed, pretending forsooth, that such translations are prin∣cipall causes of errors, and heresies; how farre are those men from the minde of the Apostle, who would haue his Epistle to be read in the publike congregation, that euen common Christians (no doubt) and all the faithfull peo∣ple of God might bee acquainted with them, but I leaue them, and for the vse of this to our selues. Is it so that the Epistles of Paul, and other Bookes of  Scripture may,We are not to despise the publike rea∣ding of the Scripture. and ought to be read in the publike con∣gregation? Let none of vs then despise the publike rea∣ding of them: happily some haue a conceit, that it is scarse lawfull for them to be present at the publike reading of the word, and therefore they purposely absent themselues till the exercise of Preaching beginne. If any so thinke, let them know it is but a fancy, Act. 15.21. It is said, that the bookes of Moses in the time of the Law were read in the Sinagogues, and so (doubtlesse) may, and ought the bookes of Moses, and other Scriptures bee now read in the publike congregation, and if Church gouernors may and ought to take order for the reading of them, wee also are bound to heare them so read. Obserue wee in the next place that the Apostle would  haue this Epistle written and directed to the Colossians to be read in the Church of the Laodiceans,The Epistles of Paul, and other bookes of Scripture doe not onely belong to thē to whom they were particu∣larly written but doe indf∣ferently be∣long to all Christians. as needfull and profitable for them also. Whence we are giuen to vnderstand this much. That howsoeuer this, and euery other Epistle, and other bookes of Scripture be directed to some one Church, or person, yet they belong to vs, and to all the Church of God, as the common and publike treasure of them all. This Epistle of Paul to the Colossians, and other bookes of
Scripture, doe not onely belong to them, to whom they were particularly written, but do indifferently appertaine to all Christians; For why? (that we may not onely af∣firme this, but proue it) as the Apostle saith, 2. Tim. 3.16. The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profi∣table to teach to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righte∣ousnesse. The Apostle, we see, there speakes not onely ge∣nerally of the whole Scripture, but indefinitely in regard of the vse of it, that it is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct and to instruct in righteousnesse, not this or that Church, or person onely, but indefinitely all, and euerie one without exception; and to this agrees also that of the Apostle, Rom. 15.4. Whatsoeuer things were written afore time, were written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope. Though indeed that place specially intend the old Testament, the writings of the Apostle being not then extant, yet it is true also of euery part of the new Testament, because the Spirit is al∣waies like it selfe, and therefore the new Testament being written by the same Spirit, is also written for our learning, aswell as the old, and whatsoeuer things are written in the bookes of the old or new Testament, are written, and doe belong to vs, Mar. 1337. Saith our Sauiour; Those things that I say vnto you, I say vnto all, as if he had said, my doctrine, and my exhortation i generall, though it bee spoken and deliuered to you, that are now my hearers, yet (indeed) it belongs to all, it concernes all men whoso∣soeuer, and so (doubtlesse) we may safely say, that how∣euer the Epistles of Paul, and other books of Scripture be directed to someone particular Church, or person, yet in∣deed, that which is written to one Church, or person, be∣longs to all the Churches of God, and the doctrine and matter of them is indifferently belonging to all Chri∣stians. And the reason of it is this. The Epistles of Paul, and other bookes of Scripture,
were by the will of God penned and committed to wri∣ting, that they might be for the genenerall good of Gods Church that they might bee the foundation and piller of true faith, as Iohn saith, Ioh. 20.31. These things are written that yee might beleeue, that Iesus is the Christ the Sonne of God, and that in beleeuing yee might haue life through his name. And therefore howsoeuer this Epistle to the Colossians, and other Epistles, and other bookes of Scripture, bee di∣rected to particular Churches, or persons, yet they con∣taine in them a perpetuall doctrine, and such a matter as is common to all Christians, to the ende of the world, and this being a cleare point. First, it serues for answer to a foolish conceit of the Pa∣pists,  An answer to a foolish con∣ceit and fond obiection of the Papists. and a fond obiection they commonly make against our doctrine. Oh (say they) your doctrine is not sound and good: and why so? Because (say they) it is not confirmed by Miracles, you pretend (say they) that you are trauelling towards heauen, and yet you know not whether you be in the right way, or no, because you haue no Miracles, as it were letters or news from heauen, from such as haue gone in the way that you walke, to assure you that they are there arriued, and that you are in the right way, which is an ab∣surd cauill. We may easily answer them, by the doctrine now deliuered, for we haue miracles to confirme the truth we professe, inasmuch as the miracles of Christ and his A∣postles are recorded in the written word of God, and bee∣ing there recorded, they serue for confirmation of the truth of the Gospell, not onely then, when they were wrought; but for confirmation of the same truth to the end of the world, and so they belong to vs also, in that our faith is the same that theirs was that did them, wee are not destitute of letters from heauen, hauing the Epistles of Paul, and other Apostles which belong to vs aswell as to them, to whom they were particularly directed. Indeed
we want such miracles, and such letters as are contained in popish legends, and Indian newe, which are meere delu∣sions of Satan, and forgeries of men. But so long as by Scripture we can iustifie our doctrine, we haue letters from heauen sufficient to assure vs, that all that truely embrace the faith we professe, being now departed this life, are safe∣lie arriued in the kindome of heauen, and therefore it is but a cauill, to say we want miracles, and letters from hea∣uen, to confirme our doctrine. But come wee to the vse of the doctrine that concernes our selues. Is it so that the Epistles of Paul, and other bookes of Scripture, howsoeuer they be directed to particular Chur∣ches,Wee are to make vse of the bookes of Scripture ei∣ther read or expounded to our selues par∣ticularly. yet the matter of them doth indifferently belong to all Christians? Let vs then take notice of this, and learne wee, whensoeuer wee heare the Epistles of Paul, or other bookes of Scripture read, or expounded, or wee our selues doe read in them, then to thinke thus with our selues, sure∣lie that I now heare, or that I now reade, belongs to mee, and I am to make vse of it to my selfe, and though it be di∣rected to such a Church, or such a person, yet I am to take it as spoken to my selfe, it concernes me to consider how this may profit mee, either for the information of my iudgement, for my teaching in respect of some truth, or for the improuing of some error that is in mee, or for the correction and reformation of some things amisse in my life and conuersation, or for my further instructing, and my edification, and building vp in holinesse, and com∣fort. Doe thou whensoeuer thou either hearest, or readest a∣ny part of the writings of holy Scripture, euer remember this, that the matter or doctrine of that place pertaines to thy selfe, and doe thou apply the seuerall threatnings, pro∣mises, and instructions of the word, thou hearest, or rea∣dest to thine owne estate particularly. In this dutie many are exceeding short, and much de∣fectiue,Many are de∣ctiue in this utie. I might shew it in many particulars, to instance
but in one or two; the Apostle in this Epistle, Cap. 3.6. saith, that for fornication, vncleannesse, the inordinate af∣fection, euill concupiscence, and couetousnesse which is Idolatry, the wrath of God certainely comes on the chil∣dren of disobedience, He saith againe, Ephes. 5.5. That no whooremonger, neither vncleane person, nor couetous person which is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of Christ, and of God. He saith againe, 1 Cor. 6.9.10. Neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor adulte∣rers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor coue∣tous persons, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdome of God. Now consider it, doe men that are guilty of the sinnes there reckoned vp, when they heare, or reade those places, thinke they belong to themselues? Doe they apply them to themselues, and say within themselues, surely this is my state, my sinne is heere touched, and this iudgement is denounced against me? Doe they thus? No, no, nothing lesse, happily they thinke and wil confesse the things there spoken, to be true, the vilest wretch that liues may so doe: but to thinke the truth of them belongs to themselues, they are farre from that, for if they did, how durst they still liue and continue in their known sinnes, against which such fearefull iudgements are threatned. Againe the holy Ghost saith, Heb. 2.2.3. If the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and euery transgression and disobedience reciued a iust recompence of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great saluation which at the first beganne to be preached by the Lord, and after∣ward was confirmed to vs by them that heard him; the meaning is briefely this, if euery transgression of the Law was seuerely punished, how shall we escape, if we doe but neglect the Gospell? Doe men that neglect the Gos∣pell, such as, (howseuer they doe not blaspheme the Gos∣pell as the Papists doe, and call the professors of it here∣tikes) yet they loue it not as they ought, they delight not
in it, they account it not most deare and precious vnto them, and all things dung, and nothing worth in compa∣rison of it? doe such persons when they read that place thinke it belongs to them, and that iudgement is there threatned against them? No, no, no such matter, they think, that seeing they draw not their own sins after them (as it were with cart-ropes, as it is Isaiah 5.18. and they hate the knowne sinnes of many, as Adulterie, Murther, and the like, that therfore their neglect of the gospell, their want of loue vnto it, is nothing, there is no judgement of God belongs to them. This without question is the con∣ceit of many carnall Gospellers, and thus I might insist in many other particulars, and shew how we faile in this du∣tie, we thinke not that the things we heare, or reade in the Scriptures, belong to vs, and wee apply not the seuerall threatnings of the word to our owne estate and condition, we must then learne whensoeuer we either heare or reade any part of the Scripture, to thinke thus with our selues; Surely this doctrine belongs to mee, this promise is made to me,Two motiues to stirre vp to make vse of the word of God either heard or read to our selues particularly. this threatning, I being guilty of that sinne, or the like, denounced against me. And to helpe vs forward in this duty, consider we these two things. First, if we thus heare or read the word of God, we shall make it truly profitable to our selues, wee shall through  Gods blessing vpon our reading and hearing make the in∣structions, and comforts of the word our owne: yea the threatnings of it will then be profitable vnto vs, for the a∣uoyding of those sinnes against which iudgment is de∣nounced. Secondly, if we doe not thus heare or read the word of God, we shall not only strip our selues of the benefit of the instruction and comforts of it, and they shall be as the mi∣racles of Christ among the Iewes, who saw them, but were not bettered by them; or as the word preached to the old world, Hebr. 4.2. which profited them not, because it was
not tempered with faith, we shall not only do this, but wee shall one day finde the threatnings of the word verified, and made good vpon vs, to our eternall woe and confu∣sion. If then thou dost desire that the word heard, or read by thee, may be truly profitable: that the instructions, com∣forts, and threatnings of it, may be to thy good, and if thou wouldst not both strip thy selfe of the benefit of the instru∣ctions and comforts of it, and finde the threatnings of it made good vpon thy selfe, then learne thou whensoeuer thou dost either heare, or read it, to thinke, and be perswa∣ded, that the matter of it belongs to thee in particular, and that thou art to make vse of it according to the purpose and drift of it. To omit that which the Papists gather from the last words of this verse, that seeing the Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans is not to bee found, therefore some part of the Scripture is lost, and that the canonicall Scripture wee haue, is not sufficient without addition of vnwritten tradi∣tions, that being built but vpon their owne mis-interpreta∣tion of the text: the Apostle willed the Colossians to read the Epistle written from Laodicea, no doubt, that they might better vnderstand some things in this Epistle, writ∣ten to themselues. Hence we may gather. That wee may and ought to read other holy writings,  besides the written word of God,That we may and ought to read other ho¦ly writings, besides the written word of God. euen such as may helpe vs in the vnderstanding of the word. The reason is plaine, such holy writings may serue for our edification: for if we may be edified by the gracious speeches of holy men, and furthered in grace and good∣nesse by their holy life, as doubtlesse we may:  then also may we be edified by their holy writings, agreeing with the truth of Gods word: and therefore take we notice of it, that we may and ought to read holy bookes written by men, and as we are iustly to be blamed for not reading the booke of God, the Bible:  so also for not reading other ho∣ly
bookes,Men are blame-wor∣thy for not reading holy bookes writ∣ten by men. for hereby that excuse that men commonly plead, is taken away, that the Scripture is hard to bee vn∣derstood▪ for why? thou hast not only the benefit of the publike ministerie, but in this age many excellent bookes are put forth in print, that may helpe thee in the right vn∣derstanding of the word, and therefore if now thou be ig∣norant, thy ignorance is wilfull and affected, and thou art left voide of all excuse. VER. 17. And say to Archippus, take heed to the mi∣nisterie that thou hast receiued in the Lord, that thou fulfill it. In this Verse, wee haue another thing laid before vs, which the Apostle willed the Colossians to doe, (namely this) that they should speake to Archippus, and hee tells them what he should say to him, what words they should vse, and after what manner they should speake to him; as that they should speake by way of admonition, and warne him to take heed to the ministerie hee had receiued in the Lord, (And say to Archippus take heed to the ministerie that thou hast receiued in the Lord.) In this warning or admonition we haue more particu∣larly these things to be considered. 1 First the matter of the admonition, in these words, take heed to the ministerie that thou hast re∣ceiued in the Lord. 2 Then the extent of that duty, how farre forth Archippus should take heed and looke to his mi∣nisterie, (namely) so far as that he should fulfill it, Take heed to the ministerie that thou hast receiued in the Lord that thou fulfill it. 3 And thirdly, in the words of this admonition, the Apostle layes downe a strong and effectuall argu∣ment,
to perswade Archippus to take heed to his ministerie, taken from the author of his ministery, that hee had that his ministerie from the Lord, that he had receiued it by his grace, and therefore he should looke to it, and fulfill it; Take heed to the ministerie that thou hast received in the Lord that thou fulfill it. And the occasion of this warning to be giuen by the Colossians to Archippus in all likelihood and pro∣babilitie, was this. Archippus was a minister in the Church of Colosse, and was a colleague, and fellow-helper in that Church to Epa∣phras, who was then at Rome with Paul, and therefore hee ought in the absence of Epaphras, to haue been diligent in his ministerie, which it seemes he was not, and therefore the Apostle would haue him admonished, and put in minde of his duty. I will therefore briefely lay forth the sense and mea∣ning of this verse. (And say to Archippus,) that is,Interpre∣tation. admo∣nish and warne Archippus, on this manner, (take heed to the ministery,) the originall is (see to the ministery,) the meaning is, carefully looke to the office and function, diligently weigh and consider, what it is, the weight of it, and what belongs to that pastorall duty, (that thou hast re∣ceiued in the Lord) that is, that thou hast receiued from the Lord, which he of his grace and mercy, hath committed vnto thee, (that thou fulfill it.) The word fulfill, is meta∣phorically borrowed and taken from a vessell, that ought to be full of liquor, or the like matter, and is not; and the Apostle compares the ministerie of Archippus to such a vessell, which had somewhat put into it, but was not filled to the brim, as it should haue been: and so when hee saith that thou fulfill it, it is as much as if he had said, that thou fill vp that vessell of thy ministerie, as it ought to be filled, and leaue no empty place in it: and his meaning is, that thou do it not to the halfes, or in some part, and leaue it
vndone in another, but that thou performe it, in euery re∣spect, as it ought to be performed, that thou accomplish and performe all the parts of that office and ministerie; Thus then briefly conceiue the Apostles meaning. Admonish Archippus on this manner; Looke carefully, and diligently consider with thy selfe, what is that office and function, the weight of it, and what belongs to that pastorall duty, which thou hast receiued from the Lord, and which he of his grace and mercy hath committed to thee, that thou performe it in euery respect, as it ought to be performed, that thou leaue nothing vndone in that office that ought to be done, but that thou accomplish it in all the parts of it. Now first, it is not to be passed by without obseruation, that howsoeuer the Apostle in the verse before inioyned the reading of his Epistle, that it should be read both in the Church of Colosse and of Laodicea, yet heere he addes Archippus should be put in minde of his duty, that hee should be admonished to looke to the fulfilling of his mi∣nisterie, that he should be stirred vp to a diligent teaching of the word amongst the Colossians. Hence wee may gather. That howsoeuer this Epistle and other books of Scrip∣ture are to be read, yet the reading of them are not suffci∣ent, it is not enough to read the word our selues, or to hear it read, (though that is to be done) but if we will soundly profit by it, it must be taught, and we must attend to tea∣ching in the publike ministerie.It is not enough to read the word our selues, or to heare it read, but we must also at∣tend to the preaching of it in the pub∣like ministrie of it. For (indeed) the preaching of the word is the ordinance of God, which hee hath ordeined for the right vnderstan∣ding of the word, as the Eunuch said, Act: 8.31. and for the effectuall application of it, to the entring thorow, euen vnto the diuiding asunder of the soule and the spirit, and
of the ioynts and the marrow, and to the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb. 4.12. In reading there is somtimes no vnderstanding, somtimes misvnder∣standing, sometimes mis-applying the word read, and all these wants are helped and supplied by preaching. This I note in a word, against that selfe-pleasing conceit of some, who sooth vp themselues in their neglect of the publike ministerie of the word.Reproofe of such as neg∣lect the pub∣like ministery of the word. Say they wee haue the Bible, and in the Bible are the most perfect Sermons of Christ, and of his Apostles,  and we can read them in our houses, and so serue God as well as they that heare all the Sermons in the world. Indeed it is true,  the Sermons of Christ and of his Apo∣stles, are most perfect in themselues, but such persons must know, they are not so profitable to them, till they be expla∣ned, and applyed to their conscience in the ministery of the word: admit they read the word, (which may bee iustly doubted whether they do or no) but grant that they doe, and they vnderstand it, yet seldom or neuer do they throughly apply it to themselues, especially if it touch the quicke, (namely) their owne pleasing sinne; commonly men that thus excuse their neglect of the publike ministe∣rie of the word, are such as cannot abide to haue their con∣science ransackt, and ript vp, and the secrets of their hearts made manifest by the ministerie of the word, as the Apo∣stle saith, 1 Cor. 14.25 they cannot endure that the sword of the word should pierce them, and should be vsed to the cutting, and launcing, and searching of the festered sores of their soules, by the hand of another: and is it likely they will so apply it themselues, that they as it were with their owne hands will vse the word to the cutting, laun∣cing and searching of their owne festered sores? No, no, there is no likelyhood in it, and therefore it is but a vaine excuse to say they haue the Bible at home, they can, and do read in the Bible: this is but a fond shift; and we must know it is not enough for vs to read in the Bible, (though
that is our duty to be diligent in reading in it) yet that will not serue the turne, the application of the word is especi∣ally made in the publike ministerie and preaching of it, and to that wee must attend, yea though wee haue know∣ledge, and (happily) know as much as the Preacher can teach vs, yet still must we attend vpon it: for the preaching of the word, serues, not onely for the information of the iudgment, but for the framing of the will and affections to holinesse, and for the stirring of vs vp to the practise of that wee know: and in this respect must euery one at∣tend to the publike ministerie and preaching of the word. Note we further, that the Apostle heere willed the Co∣lossians to admonish their minister Archippus, as it may seeme somewhat slacke in his duty, to bee more diligent in performance of his duty; wee see then though Ministers of the word haue great authoritie ouer the Church com∣mitted vnto them by the Lord, yet notwithstanding if they be negligent in doing their duty,The place of a Minister doth not ex∣empt him frō othes mens chatable ouersigt and carefull ad∣monition. How such admonition must be vsed. they may be stird vp to a greater care in doing their duty by the same Church, and by the gouernours of it may be put in minde of their duty, and reprooued, if they deserue reproofe: their pla∣ces do not exempt them from other mens charitable ouer∣sight and carefull admonition. Yet such admonition must be vsed with reuerence and due regard, euen with regard had to their pastor, as one sent to them from the Lord for their good: It is the Apostles rule, 1 Tim: 5.1. Rebuke not an Elder, but reprooue him as a Father; the reproofe of an Elder must be a submissiue and reuerent exhortation of him, but I will not further insist on that. Come we to the admonition it selfe, which the Apostle willed the Colossians to vse to Archippus their Minister: say to him (saith the Apostle) take heed to the ministerie thou hast receiued in the Lord that thou fulfill it. Where first we are to marke, the Apostle bids the Colossians, not bare∣ly to say to Archippus, fulfill thy ministery, but that they
should say to him, take heed to it, that thou fulfill it diligent∣ly, consider thy ministery, what it is, the weight of it, and that thou fulfill it; where in the first place we are giuen to vnderstand, That a Minister of the word ought diligently and care∣fully to consider his ministery:A Minister of the word ought dili∣gently and carefully to consider his ministrie. there must be in the Mi∣nister of the word, a diligent and due consideration of his office and calling, what it is, and the weight of it: a Mini∣ster must duly and seriously consider, what he is called vn∣to, euen to bee the messenger and ambassadour of the Lord, to carry his message, and his embassage to his peo∣ple, and to intreat of conditions of peace between God and his people, and to stand in Christ his stead, 2 Cor. 5.20. to be Gods interpreter to the people, and the peoples to God, Ierem: 33.23. and he is to consider the weight of his calling, that he is put in trust with the soules of men, yea the soules of men purchased with so great a price, as the most precious bloud of the only begotten sonne of God, Acts 20.28. and that he is put in trust with the holy wor∣ship of God, and with his holy name (as it were) with his crowne and dignitie, and with the dispensation and dispo∣sing of his secrets, 1 Cor. 4.1. and that it belongs to him, to teach, to improoue, to correct, to instruct, to exhort, to comfort, to watch, to pray, to go in and our before Gods people vnblameably; these and many other like, are the things that euery Minister of the word ought to thinke on, to consider and to haue an eye to, at all times. A duty wherein many Ministers are farre short and much defectiue; some Ministers full litle thinke on it, that they are called to be the messengers of God,Reproofe of such ministers as consider not the weight of their calling. to deliuer his message to his people, if they did, they would not then deliuer their owne inven ions vnto them: and many haue litle consideration of it, that they are put in trust with Gods people, and that the weight of their soules doth lye vpon them, their idlenesse, their negligence, their frothy and vnprofitable teaching, plainly shewes it.
I might insist in many other particulars; but for more generall vse of the point, consider wee, what the Apostle saith, Rom. 13.4.6. that euen such as are deputed of the Lord to a place of ciuill gouernment, are called Ministers of God, they haue an office and a ministry. Now then, as there must be in a Minister of the word a due considera∣tion of his office and function, what it is, and the the weight of it: so doubtlesse ought there to bee in ciuill gouernours, in publike or in priuate,Ciuill gouer∣nors in pub∣like or in pri∣uate, are to consider the weight of their office and calling. be it but a master of a familie, euen such persons ought to see to their ministery and office, and to consider what it is, what belongs to it, and what is the weight of it, they are seriously to consider with themselues, that they are deputed of the Lord to that office, and that they are in his place, and stand in his stead, to those that are vnder them, and that it belongs to their office, according to their power, to protect the innocent, to punish the offendor, to incourage the well-doer, and to discountenance and censure the euill doer, and so to guide and gouerne those vnder them, as may befor the good of their bodies and soules: yea men that haue any office or function, are to consider what belongs to that office in particular: as, a master of a familie is seriously to consider, that it belongs to him to command things lawfull, to such as be vnder him, and proportionable to their strength, to prouide for them (as hee is able) meate, drinke and all, things needefull, to yeeld them moderate rest and recrea∣tion, to teach, to admonish, to correct them as iust occasi∣on is offered, to pray with them, to pray for them, and the like; and euery one that hath an office, either publike or priuate, is to consider the waight of that office, how much and how deepely it concernes him, to doe the duties that belong to that office, and that the doing of them so neere∣ly concernes him, as if he neglect them, and any vnder him offend, and sinne, thorow his default; that sinne of the inferiour shall increase the iudgement of the superi∣our in the day of account. Exod. 16.27. It is said that
some of the people went out on the seuenth day to gather Manna, but found none, whereupon it is said, verse 28. that the Lord reproued Moses, and said vnto him, How long refuse yee to keepe my Commandements and my Lawes? Now Moses had not prophaned the Sabbath, but the peo∣ple, and not all, but some of the people, yet the Lord re∣proued Moses because the people that were vnder his charge had sinned: so waighty a burden lies on those that haue any way the ouersight of others, that they must giue account in regard of their sinnes, if they offend through their default, and neglect of duty; and thus ought such as haue any office or function publike or priuate, diligent∣lie to waigh and consider with themselues, what that of∣fice is, what belongs, vnto the waight of it. Thus no doubt, did Salomon when he made that praier to the Lord, 1 King. 3.9. Giue to thy seruant an vnderstanding heart, that I may discerne betweene good and bad: and hee doth expresse as much in the last words of the verse, For who is able to iudge this thy mighty people, as if he said, I consider the waight of mine office, and I finde it great and waightie; therefore Oh Lord I beseech thee strengthen me, and enable mee to doe my dutic; and to this purpose (no doubt) was that wholesome admonition of Iehoshaphat to his Iudges, 2. Chron. 19.6.7. Take heede what yee doe: for yes execute not the iudgements of man, but of the Lord, and he will bee with you, in the cause and iudgement. Wherefore now let the feare of the Lord be vpon you, take heede, and doe it: for there is no iniquitie with the Lord our God, nether respect of persons, nor reciuing of reward. As if hee had said, diligently consider with your selues, what offiice you are called to, what is the charge that lies vpon you, what be∣longs to your office, you execute not the iudgements of man, but of the Lord, and hee will bee with you in the cause and iudgement. And consider with your selues, your charge is is so waighty, that you must one day giue ac∣count of it before the iudge of all the world, with whom
is neither respect of persons nor receiuing reward. Thu are such as haue any office or charge ouer others, be it publike, or priuate, duely to consider that office and chage what it is,Ciuill gouer∣nors iustly re∣proued for not considering the waight o their office and calling. what belongs vnto it, and the waight of it. Now doe men that haue charge ouer others consider these things? Doe they (as they ought) thinke on it, what the office and place is which they are called to, what be∣longs vnto it, and the waight of it? Few there be that doe so, many men are altogether carelesse, they set all at sixe and seuen, haue no manner of consideration what their office and charge is, and what belongs vnto it; and most men haue an eie, not to their office and charge, and what belongs to that, but to the example of others, they consi∣der what other men of like place doe, and they doe the like, such and such masters, (saith one that is a master of a familie) neither teach their families, nor pray with them, and they thriue well enough, and therefore thinkes hee, I may doe the like; others againe, consider onely what is to bee done in their place and calling, standing best with their ease, their profit, and their credit in the world, thus and many other waies doe men faile in this dutie. Well know thou whosoeuer thou art, thou art to take heede and to see to thine office, and to consider seriously what it is, what belongs vnto it, and the waight of it. And that thou maiest so doe, learne thy dutie what belongs to thine office and calling out of the word of God. Deut. 17.19. the King is enioined to reade the word of God, all the daies of his life, that thence he may learne his duty and in the word of God the Lord hath laide downe, the offices and duties of all sorts of callings, of Magistrates, Ministers, Masters, particularly, to that end (without question) that they should learne, know, and consider them; doe thou therefore thence learne the things that concerne thine of∣fice, and knowing those things, consider them, and haue an eie to them at all times. And to that purpose remember these two things.
1 First,Two things are to bee thought vpon by such as bee ciuill gouer∣noure. it is for want of taking heede to the duties of mens callings, and want of consideration of them, that men transgresse their callings, and go beyond the bounds of their callings, and so lay themselues open to the plagues and iudgements of God, no doubt it was so with Vzziah in putting his hand to the Arke, 2. Sam. 6.6. and the Lord smote him for it. And it was for want of considerati∣on of his calling, that Peter would warme himselfe at the High Priests fire, Luke 22.15. It cost him the breach of his conscience, and as one saith well, if wee marke the time when the iudgements of God befall men,Note. wee shall finde they are cast vpon them when they are out of their callings. 2 Againe, remember this that the want of considera∣tion of their callings, and the waight of them, is that which makes men carelesse and vnconscionable in doing their duties, for what is it that makes men, either neglect the duties of their callings, or to doe them onely for fashion? Surely this, they pull away their eies from their callings, they looke not (as they ought) to the duties of them, and on the waight of them, but they cast their eies to the example of others, on their owne ease, profit, or estimati∣on in the world, and thence it comes that they are care∣lesse and vnconscionable in doing the duties of their cal∣lings. If then thou wouldest not goe beyond the limits of thy calling, and so lay thy selfe naked and open to the iudge∣ments of God, if thou wouldest not bee carelesse and vn∣conscionable in doing the duties of thy calling, but rather doe them with care, and good conscience, and with com∣fort to thine owne soule, then doe thou consider thine of fice, and calling, take thou heede and haue an eie to the duties of it, and to the waight of it: euer meditate and thinke thus with thy selfe, this is mine office and calling, these are the duties that belong to it, and they are of this waight, and consequence, that the neglect or carelesse do∣ing
of them will bring downe Gods iudgements vpon me, and I shall one day answer for the same. Let this bee thy meditation and consideration in respect of thy place and calling whatsoeuer it is. In the next place we are to marke that the Apostle bids the Colossians say to Archippus, take heed to the ministrie that thou hast receiued in the Lord that thou fulfill it, v∣sing as we shewed, a word taken from a vessell that ought to be full and is not, meaning this, that Archippus should (as it were) fill vp the vessell of his ministrie, that hee should as he had begunne to doe something in his mini∣strie, to accomplish it to the full in euery respect, and leaue no part or dutie of it vnfulfilled, vnperformed. Where wee may easily see thus much laide before vs. It is not in∣ough for a mi∣nister of the Gospell to performe one part of his of∣fice alone, but he must exe∣cute and ful∣fill all and e∣uerie part of his office.That it is not inough for a Minister of the word to be∣ginne and to continue doing some thing that belongs to him in his place and calling, but he must accomplish and performe all things that pertaine to him in the same, it is not sufficient for a Minister of the Gospell to take paines in one part of his office alone, as in teaching onely, exhor∣ting onely, or that hee liue free from any speciall scandall or offence, but he must execute and fulfill all and euery part of his office and ministrie, he must teach, improoue, correct, instruct, exhort, comfort, &c. as any occasion is offered vnto him; and hee must watch ouer his people, and goe in and out before them vnblameably, and so car∣rie himselfe in the discharge of his ministrie; as it may truely be said of him that hee filles vp the vessell of his mi∣nistrie, and so performes his dutie in euery respect as there can be no further dutie required of him, as hee is a Mini∣ster. And this is further taught plainely, 2 Tim. 4. Where the Apostle hauing laid downe the speciall duties that be∣long to a Minister of the word, with a waighty charge pressing Timothy to the practise of them, I charge thee be∣fore
God, and before the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing, and in his kingdome preach the word, be instant in season and out of season, improue, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine: he addes verse 5. Doe the worke of an Euangelist: make thy Ministrie fully knowne: as if hee had said, these are the duties that belong to thee in thy ministrie, and thinke it not suffici∣ent to doe some of them, and leaue the rest vndone, but doe them all and euery one, fulfill thy ministrie, and make it fully knowne. I might easily insist further on this point,Reprfe of Ministers al∣together care∣lesse of their dutie, and of such also as do their duty but in part. and for the vse of it I might heereby taxe and reproue many ministers of the word, some being altogether carelesse, such as la∣bour not in any part of their ministrie, either in teaching or liuing vnblameably, and so are farre from labouring in euery part of it. Some againe, labouring in some duties of the Ministrie, and not in all, as (happilie) teaching, but not exhorting, or exhorting without ground of doctrine, or teaching and exhorting well, but liuing ill, and giuing iust cause of scan∣dall and offence, or liuing in good order without touch of any notorious crime, yea (happily) shewing forth some vertues, as mercy, loue, pitty towards the poore, and such as want helpe, but not able to teach and to doe the most needfull duty of their place and calling: these and many other waies I might shew, how some Ministers of the word faile in not fulfilling their ministrie, they leaue as it were an emptinesse in that vessell, they fill it not vp, as it ought to bee filled, they performe it not in euery respect as it ought to bee performed, but to extend the point a lit¦tle further and that vpon the ground before deliuered, Ro. 13. That such as be in place of ciuill gouernment, publike or priuate, haue a ministrie giuen them of God, as there∣fore the Minister of the word must not hold it enough for him to labour in some duties of his ministrie, and leaue the rest vndone, that is to fill his ministrie but in part, and
not to fulfill it, and if he will fullfill his Ministry, it must be by doing all the duties that belong to that office. So (doubtlesse) ought it to be with such as haue any o∣ther place or office in publike or in priuate,Such as bee in any place of ciuill gouern∣ment must fulfill their of∣fice, executing and doing all & euery part and dutie of the same. they must not content themselues in doing of some duties that be∣long to that place, and leaue the rest vndone, that is to leaue a gap, and an emptie place in their office, and place but they must fill it vp in the execution and performance of all and euery part and dutie of the same, for why? Eue∣rie man in his place & lawful calling whatsoeuer it be, is to be faithful; we find it giuen to Moses by the Lord himselfe in way of commendation Num. 12.7. That he was faithfull in his office: and to Christ himselfe, Heb. 3.2. and it is the A∣postle rule, Rom. 12.7. Let him that hath an office attend on it with diligence, and faithfulnesse. Now a man is not faithfull, if he doe some duties that belong to his place and calling though he doe them with great diligence and paines, and leaue other duties of it vndone; and therefore in euery place and calling, there must be a performance of all and euery dutie belonging to the same. Againe, all and euery duty of euery lawfull calling are inioined by the commandement of the Lord, and men are as strictly bound by the commandement of God, to the doing of one part of their office, as another, successiuely and at times fit for the doing of it, and therefore men must not content themselues with the doing of some du∣ties that belong to their place and calling, but they must performe and do all and euery duty of it, that is the fulfil∣ling of their office, and their ministery. Reproofe of such as rest in the doing of some of the duties of their place and cal∣ling, and neg∣lect others.Now this is a thing litle thought on by most men in the world, most men content themselues in the doing of some duties that belong to them in their place and calling, though they neglect others: yea some exceedingly please, themselues in this, that they are diligent and painefull in doing only some things that concerne them in their par∣ticular office and calling.
To instance but in one or two particulars. Some Pa∣rents (it may be) suffer their children to want nothing be∣longing to their bodies, they giue them meat, drinke and clothing, and prouide all outward things needfull for them: yea sometimes they make themselues drudges to scrape vp abundance of wealth for them against after∣times, and yet all this while neglect that duty laid vpon them, Ephes. 6.4. of bringing vp their children in instru∣ction and information of the Lord, that duty they per∣forme not; and so some masters (happily) lay no more on their seruants than they are able to do, they prouide for them wholsome and sufficient meat and drinke, and in season, and they giue them leaue to refresh themselues at times conuenient, but as for the duty of teaching and in∣structing them, and praying for them, those things are not thought vpon: and yet such Parents and such Masters please themselues in that which they doe, and thinke they haue done that which concernes them towards their chil∣dren and seruants: yea somtimes they sticke not to say it, they haue done the part of Parents and Masters: some∣times such Parents say to their children, wee haue spared from our owne backes and bellies for you, wee haue fared hardly, and gone thinly clad, for you, and we haue labou∣red night and day for your good, &c. and such Masters say to their seruants, what can you complaine of? haue you not had your meate and drinke wholesome and good, and your wages paid you? haue wee laid too much vpon you, &c. thus many Parents and Masters content themselues in doing only some things that concerne them as they are Parents and Masters, and thinke that in so do∣ing they haue discharged their office: but know thou whosoeuer thou art, thou being a Father or a Master, it is not enough for thee to do some duties, but thou must doe all that concernes thee in that place and calling, thou must fulfill thine office, and leaue nothing vndone in it, that ought to be done.
And to this purpose, A motiue to stirre vp men to fulfill their office in any place or cal∣ling.Consider that euery duty in thy place and calling more neerely concernes thy selfe, then those to whom it ought to be performed, for the doing of it may bring good to them, but much more good and comfort to thy selfe, in testifying thy faith, and sealing vp comfort to thine owne conscience: and the neglect of it may hinder their good, but it makes thee liable to the iudgment of God and dee∣per condemnation, and therfore look thou fulfil thine of∣fice. Alas will some say, I am not able to fulfill it, and to do all the duties that belong to mine office, I am not able to teach my family. Art thou not? that is thy shame, labour that thou maiest bee able, and according to that abilitie thou hast, performe that duty, and know for thy comfort, the Lord requires not the fulfilling of thine office, in do∣ing the duties of it in perfect measure, that is impossible, it is but a conceit of the Papists, that men regenerate may fulfill the law of God in the time of this life, and may doe more than they are commanded, euen works of super∣errogation: that is but a fancy: do thou therefore all and euery duty of thy place and calling, and though thou doe some of them in weaknesse and much infirmitie, yet the Lord will not cast away those duties so performed, if thou doe them in truth and sinceritie of heart, but will accept them in Christ, and let that be thy comfort. Now touching the argument the Apostle would haue to be vsed to perswade Archippus to take heed to his mini∣sterie, and to the fulfilling of it, in that he would haue him stirred vp thereunto, because hee had receiued it from the Lord, that the Lord of his grace and goodnesse had com∣mitted that office to him, it is easie to be concluded from hence. That it is a notable and very effectuall argument to stir vp a minister of the gospell to a carefull and comfortable performance of his duty in that he hath receiued his mini∣stery from the Lord,In that a mi∣nister of the gospell hath receiued his ministry from the Lord, it is of great weight to perswade him to a carefull performance of his duty. in that the Lord of his grace and
mercy hath reputed him faithfull, and put him in that of∣fice, as the Apostle saith, 1 Tim. 1.12. it is a very powerfull and preuayling argument to stirre vp a minister of the gospell, to be diligent, carefull, faithfull, and zealous in ful∣filling his ministry, yea it serue notably to comfort him against the stormes and persecutions that are or may bee raised against him in doing his duty. For he hauing receiued his ministry from the Lord hee knowes the Lords arme is long and strong enough both to sustaine and vphold him,  and to render vengeance to those that shall vniustly disturbe him. These things might be further stood on, but let it suffice to haue named them. Now heere a question is to be answered, (i.) this. How shall a minister of the word,  know that he hath re∣ceiued his ministry from the Lord, and that the Lord hath put him in that office. Answ.  By three things. First, if the Lord haue giuen him a competent measure  of gifts fit for the worke of his ministry. Secondly, if hee vpon tryall and examination being  found fit for that office, be designed to it by the gouernors of the Church. Thirdly, if (hee exercising those gifts bestowed vpon  him and faithfully discharging his duty) the Lord giue a blessing vnto his labours. By these shall a minister know that hee hath receiued his ministry from the Lord. They of the separation,  say our ministers are no true ministers, why so? Forsooth onely because they are not rightly called (as they suppose) by men.  They cannot deny but that many of them are suffi∣ciently qualified with gifts fit for the ministry, and that exercising those gifts, the Lord giues a blessing of their labours in the true conuersion of many soules to God. But (say they) they are not rightly called by men, and therefore no true ministers. Admit this to be true (which they are neuer able to prooue) shall an error and fayling
in men, make voide the calling of God? graunt this that there is some defect in the maner of their calling by men, for that is all they stand vpon, yet they hauing a compe∣tent measure of gifts fit for the ministry, and exercising those gifts by allowance from men that are in place and authoritie, and the Lord vouchsafing a blessing vpon their labours, it is a sufficient approbation of their calling. oh but they would haue the consent of the people in cal∣ling of ministers:  who sees not their consent, in as much as they willingly submit themselues to their ministry, and are effectually wrought vpon by it, to their calling and conuersion, yea therein the Lord doth (as it were) set his hand and seale to their ministry, and approoue it. A false teacher may conuert others (this is said by them but they are not able to proove it.) No surely, if this were true, then the argument of the Apostle was not good,  whereby hee prooued himselfe a true Apostle, 1 Cor: 9.1.2. Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? haue I not seene Iesus Christ our Lord? are yee not my work in the Lord? If I be not an Apostle vnto others, yet doubt∣lesse I am vnto you, for ye are the seale of mine Apostleship in the Lord. The question was whether he were a true Apo∣stle or no: how doth he prooue it? surely thus. That he was the instrument and meanes of their conuersion, and therefore a true Apostle; Now if it were so, that a false teacher might conuert soules, they might haue said, this is no good argument, but the Apostle knew well they could not so reply, he knew his argument to be sound and good, and if it was a good argument to prooue Paul a true Apo∣stle, then much more is it a good argument to prooue an ordinary minister, a true minister, and called of God, that the Lord giues a blessing to his labours for the conuersion of soules. From this argument (thou hast receiued in the Lord) we may further gather. That in euery office and lawfull calling that men hold in Church or common-wealth, they are to haue an eye to
the Lord,In euery law∣full calling, wherein men are, they must remember that they haue receiued it from the lord. and to remember that they haue receiued it from him, that the Lord of his grace and goodnesse hath vouchsafed to set them in that place and calling, be it neuer so meane, and if it bee a place of greater eminencie and dignitie, men are the more to looke vp to the Lord, and to consider the greatnesse of Gods grace in that their ad∣uancement. Thus did Paul, Rom: 12.3. I say through the grace that is giuen vnto me. and 1 Cor: 15.10. by the grace of God I am that I am. and hence it is that the Lord is wont to set out the greatnesse of the sinne of men in high place, with the aduancement he had vouchsafed them. Thus hee set out the sinne of Ieroboam, of Saul, yea of Dauid himselfe, 2 Sam: 12 17. I haue annoynted thee King ouer Israel, and de∣liuered thee out of the hand of Saul, &c. And this is of ex∣cellent vse and speciall consequence: if men in any place and calling, to which they are lawfully called, euer looke vp to the Lord, and remember that hee of his grace and goodnesse hath brought them to that place, doubtlesse, it will make men content with it, be it neuer so meane, and if it be a place of greater eminencie,  thankfull to God for his mercy,Men hauing an eye to the Lord, from whom they haue receiued their places and callings, it makes them contented and thankfull, and humble, and faithfull, and conscionable, in discharging their duties. and it will make them walke humbly in that place, yea faithfull and conscionable in doing the duties of it, knowing that as they haue receiued it from the Lord, so one day an account of it, is to be made to him. Kings and other great men, may make their vnder officers, but wee must remember that the offices themselues are from the Lord, and though the Prince may giue thee an office, yet he cannot giue thee a quietus est for thy vnfaithfulnesse in that office, that is aboue his power, therefore euer looke thou to the Lord, from whom thou hast receiued thine office, and thus thinke with thy selfe: surely the Lord of his goodnesse and grace hath brought me to this office, hee ordeined it before all times, that I should haue this of∣fice, he hath chosen out my Fathers house, (happily) base and obscure, and me the meanest of my brethren, he hath
prepared a way and meanes for me, to come to this place, in my iudgment, weake and vnlikely, and he hath preuai∣led ouer many great letts and impediments, that stood vp against me, and hath put me into this place and office. Thus thinke with thy selfe, and thus consider the grace and goodnesse of the Lord in bringing thee to that place thou now holdest, and thou shalt finde it will be a notable meanes to make thee contented with thy place, and thank∣full to God for it, and humble in thy selfe, and faithfull and conscionable in doing the duties of it. VER. 18. The saluation by the hand of me Paul: Remember my bands. Grace bee with you, Amen. In this Verse we haue the closing or shutting vp of this Epistle,The shutting vp of this Epi∣stle. and the Apostle shuts it vp both with his owne sa∣lutation to the Colossians, and that not written by the hand of his Secretarie (as the other were) but with his own hand, The salutation by the hand of me Paul. and with his prayer to God for them, that the grace of God might bee with them, (Grace be with you) to which is added the vsuall word commonly subioyned to petitions made to the Lord (Amen.) and between these two, between the Apo∣stles salutation and prayer, is inserted and interlaced a short precept, that they should be mindfull of him, and re∣member his bands. I will first cleare the words of this verse, touching the sense and meaning of them; The salu∣tation by the hand of me Paul:Interpreta∣tion. that is I Paul salute you vn∣der mine owne hand; or, I Paul send salutations to you written with mine owne hand. (Remember my bands.) By bands, we are to vnderstand his imprisonment, which hee suffered for the gospell of Christ: and the Apostle would haue the Colossians mindfull of his imprisonment
in praying for him, and in making vse of his sufferings for the gospell to themselues, that they should both commend him to God in their prayers, and pray to the Lord to giue him patience, strength, and constancie in his troubles, to stand fast in defence of the gospell, and to giue him what∣soeuer his prisoners estate might stand in need of, and that they should make vse of his patient and constant suffering for the truth of the Gospell to themselues, and thereby themselues be more confirmed in the truth of the gospell, and incouraged to beare the like troubles for it, if they should bee called vnto it. (Grace be with you.) that is, the free and vndeserued loue and fauour of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with you. (Amen.) The word Amen being heere added to the Apostles peti∣tion, it signifies his wish and desire of that he prayed for, and it is also a testifying of his assurance to obtaine that which he prayed for; for that is the vse of the word (amen) at the end and shutting vp of prayer, and so it is as much as if he had said, so be it, I wish it so, yea I do fully beleeue it shall be so, I assure my selfe that the Lord in his good time will graunt my request. Thus then are we to conceiue the apostles mening in the words of this verse as if he had said. I Paul send salutations to you written with mine owne hand, and I would haue you mindfull of my imprisonment, both in praying to God for me, that he would giue me patience, strength, and constancy in my troubles, to stand fast in the defence of the Gospell, and that he would giue me whatsoeuer my prisoners estate standeth in neede of, and in making vse of my suffering for the truth, thereby the more to confirme you in the truth of the gospell, and to in∣courage you to beare the like troubles, if you be called vnto them. And the free and vndeserued loue of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it, be with you; so I wish and desire, and do fully beleeue and assure my selfe it shall be so.
Come we now to speake of the things heere laid before vs, in that order they are propounded by the holy ghost, and first of the Apostles owne salutation sent to the Colos∣sians: he sent salutations from himselfe to the Colossians, (no doubt) as a token of his true and vnfained loue to them, the point from hence offered. That wee in like sort may salute others, and thereby te∣stifie our loue vnto them. I haue already handled, and therefore I passe by it, and the thing we are especially to marke in these words is this, that the Apostle sent his owne salutations to the Colossi∣ans, written not by the hand of his Secretarie, as the fore¦going salutations were, but with his owne hand. Now what might be the reason of this? (for thence we shall ga∣ther the doctrine,) the reason of it is giuen by the Apostle himselfe, 2 Thess. 3.17. where he thus writes, The salutation of me Paul, with mine owne hand, which is the token in euery Epistle, so I write: as if he had said, I send salutations vnto you written with mine owne hand, and in this manner of writing, written in these characters, and after this forme of leters (so I write) as a token and certaine marke that I vse in euery Epistle of mine, whereby men may know them to be (indeed) my Epistles, and that they come from me, and are not counterfet. Wee see then the reason why the  Apostle heere writ salutations to the Colossians with his owne hand,It is an olde sleight of Sa∣tan and his instrument▪ (if they can to thrust vpon the Church forged and couterfet writings in stead of true, to corru t re¦ligion and to deceiue Gods people. it was this to preuent the danger of counter∣fet Epistles that might passe vnder his name, that all might know by that his hand-writing, that it was Pauls owne Epistle, and not one foisted, and thrust in insteed of his. Hence we may easily gather thus much. That it is an ancient sleight of Satan, and his instru∣ments, to thrust vpon the Church (if possibly hee may) forged and counterfet writings in stead of true, thereby to corrupt religion, and to deceiue the people of God, it is an old stratageme, and tricke of the Deuill (if hee can) to
foist into the Church, bastardly writings, vnder the names of Apostles, and other Ancient writers, thereby to spread many errors, and for the corrupting of sound and whole∣some doctrine. Thus it was in the Apostles time, and therefore hee writ salutations with his owne hand, to preuent the danger of such counterfet writings; yea this further appeares 2 Thes. 2.2. Where hee doth beseech them of that Church, by the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ, and by their assem∣bling vnto him, that they should not be suddenly moued from their mind, nor troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from him and the other Apostles, as if he had said, there be some that carry about counter∣fet letters vnder my name, but be not you suddenly mo∣ued from your minde by such letters, bearing my name, or the name of some other Apostle. And this being so in ancient times, euen in the time of  the Apostles, wee are not to maruell at it in times succee∣ding, especially in the daies of Antichrist,We are not to be troubled at this that many Popish Ca∣nons, Decrees and determi∣nations are fathered vpon Apostles, Fa∣thers, and Councels. and when hee was in his ruffe, wee are not then to thinke it strange, that then many counterfet writings were thrust vpon the Church, and we must know it is of no force, and nothing worth, which is commonly in the mouthes of our aduer∣saries the Papists: these are the Canons of the Apostles, these are the Decrees of the Fathers, these are the deter¦minations of Councels; for many times such Canons, Decrees, and determinations, carrying the names of Apo∣stles, Fathers, and Councels, if they bee duly examined, prooue no better then the idle dreames of fat-bellied Monckes; we finde many counterfet writings fathered on men of ancient times, which (indeede) were neuer knowne to them, yea from this sleight of the Deuill came those forged Gospels of Nichodemus, of Thomas, of Bar∣tholmew, the Acts of Abdias, and many counterfet Epi∣stles, as that to Laodicea, &c. Now then for further vse of this to our selues.
Seeing it is so, hence it followes that it is needefull there should be some markes by which men may know Scrip∣ture to bee true Canonicall Scripture,It is needfull here should be some infal∣lible workes by which men should know Scripture to be Canonicall there must needes be some infallible notes by which the writings of the Pro∣phets and Apostles, may bee discerned, and distinguished from all other writings of men whatsoeuer, and whereby men may bee certified and assured that they are the wri∣tings of the Prophets and Apostles, and so indeed the true word of God. Now what bee these markes may somy say? If the Pa∣pists answer this question, they will tell you, the marke by which wee may know Scripture to bee true Canonicall Scripture,The Popish note & marke of Canonicall Scripture. is the testimonie and tradition of the Church, because the Church saith so, and it is the tradition of the Church, that these and these are the Prophets and Apo∣stles; and therefore we know them to be so; but this can∣not bee an infallible note and marke whereby wee may know Scripture to be Scripture, because the authoritie of the Church is inferiour to the Scripture, the excellency and authority of Scripture being aboue all men and An∣gels, as appeares Gal. 1.8. Therefore the Church cannot authorize the word of God, and certainely assure men, this is Scripture, this is not; The Ministrie of the Church may induce and mooue men to assent to the Scripture,Note. but it cannot authorize it in the minde and conscience of any; no,True and in∣fallible marks and notes of Canonicall Scripture. no, there bee other infallible notes and markes, by which we may know Scripture to bee Scripture, and those perpetuall, as namely. 1 The euidence of the Spirit imprinted in the Scripture, and shewing it selfe in euery line of it. 2 The purity and perfection of Scripture. 3 The consent of one part with another. 4 The antiquity of it. 5 The maiesty of it in plainenesse of speech. 6 The power of it ouer the conscience. and
7 The wonderfull effect of it; the Gospell being contrarie to mans corrupt nature, yet hath it in all ages wonne men to it. 8 The certaine prophesies of things to come, which none but God could foretell. 9 The admirable preseruation of it against time and tyrants. 10 The Deuils rage against them that follow it. 11 The iudgements of God, that haue befallen such as opposed it. 12 The constant sufferings of many millions that haue shedde their bloud for the Gospell of Christ. These, and many other like, are notes and markes whereby wee may discerne, and certainly know the wri∣tings of the Prophets and Apostles to bee their writings, and may distinguish them from al other writings whatso∣euer. And touching these, and the like infallible notes of Scripture, we must finde them so to our selues, they must be meanes to settle our consciences, and to assure vs that the Canonicall bookes of the old and new testament, are (indeed) the word of God. It is to bee feared,We are to bee perswaded that the books of the old and new Testa∣ment are the word of God. if the Lord should suffer Religion to be altered with the time, that many amongst vs would be found vnsetled touching this point, and would bee ready to yeeld consent to any counterset writings in stead of the Scripture, time of trial may come we know not how soon; therefore labour thou to bee setled in this assurance, that the Canonicall writings of the Prophets and Apostles are indeede the word of the eternall God, and neuer rest till thou be thereunto perswaded by the euidence of the Spi∣rit imprinted in them, and by the puritie, perfection, ma∣iestie, power, and spirituall grace, appearing in them, yea, neuer rest till thou finde that Spirit and grace powerfull in thine owne heart, and then vndoubtedly,Note. though neuer a
man in the world acknowledge Scripture to be Scripture, yet thy heart seasoned with grace, will make thy mouth confesse it. And so much of the Apostles salutation written with his owne hand. Now to his precept (Remember my bands) bee mindefull of my imprisonment in praying for mee, and in making vse of it to yourselues. Where first wee may obserue, that the Apostle did not dissolutely cast off the care of his owne estate, he was not secure, as presuming vpon his strength in time of his trou∣ble, but himsefe begged of God continually, and hee re∣quested the Church also to beg for him, whatsoeuer should be needfull for him in that estate. Whence we learne thus much, I will but name it. That Gods children should be farre from carnall secu∣rity, and confidence in their strength and wisdome in the time of their trouble and afflicton,Gods childrē should bee far from carnall securitie and confidence in their strength and wisdome in time of their affliction Gods children should be farre from presuming and lifting vp themselues in re∣gard of their strength in time of triall, by sickenesse, im∣prisonment or the like, they should then bee instant with the Lord in praier themselues, for strength, patience, and comfort, and all graces needefull, and also intreate o∣thers to bee mindefull of them in their praiers to that pur∣pose in time of trouble and triall, euen the best and dearest of Gods children haue need of other mens helpe by their praiers to recommend them to God, crauing for them strength, and patience, and comfort. It is an easie matter to see and acknowledge Gods mer∣cy,  and good prouidence in time of health, peace, and plenty,Gods chil∣dren are to seeke to God for strength, power, and comfort in time of their trouble. and to rest contented therewith. But it is hard to the best to doe it in time of trouble, and affliction, and to quiet themselues with Gods disposing hand in the day of trouble, sickenesse, or any other distresse, is no easie matter for the best of Gods children: and therefore then they are to call vpon God for strength, patience, and com∣fort
themselues, and to entreat others to doe the like for them. This point I further handled, verse the 3. and therefore I passe by it and come to consider the precept it selfe, (Re∣member my bands.) Where we are plainely taught this duty. That we are to take knowledge of the afflictions of our brethren, and to be mindefull of them,Wee are to take notice of the afflicti∣ons of our brethren, and to be so mind∣full of them as that we helpe and releeue them what we are able. yea so mindefull of them, as that we reach out our helping hand to them by praier, by comfort, or otherwise, as occasion shall be offe∣red vnto vs. And this is further most plainely taught, Heb. 13.3. Re∣member (saith the author of that Epistle) them that are in bonds, as though yee were bound with them: and them that are in affliction, as if yee were also afflicted in the body. If our selues were in prison, or any way afflicted, without questi∣on, we would be so mindefull of our selues, as wee would earnestly call vpon God for ease, comfort, release, and de∣liuerance, and we would vse all good meanes we were able to releeue our selues, so ought wee to doe to our brethren in time of their affliction, euen to pray for their ease, com∣fort and deliuerance, and to comfort and helpe them, as if we were in their stead. The reason and ground of this we finde, 1. Cor. 12.26. We are members of one bodie, and therefore should haue a feeling of the hurt one of another, and be touched with it: yea so touched, as that we should bee carefull for the good of one another. We haue often had occasion to speak of this point, yet it cannot to often bee remembred, it is a dutie wherein we are much defectiue: it was the complaint of the Prophet Amos 6.4.5.6. that men in his time did lie on their beds, and stretch themselues on their beds, and eat the lambes of the flocke, and calues out of the stall; they sing to the sound of the Violl, they inuent to them∣selues instruments of musicke like Dauid. They drinke wine in bowles, and annointed themselues with the chiefe
oyntment, but no man was sorry for the affliction of Io∣seph,  no man remembred the affliction of their brethren, and this complaint may iustly be taken vp against many in these daies that enioy health, wealth, liberty and plenty of all things, and they passe their time in feasting and iollity, and haue little or no remembrance, at least no feeling re∣membrance of the afflictions of their poore brethren,Iust reproofe of those who enioying ma∣ny good things passe their time in iollity, & for∣get the affli∣ction of their poore bre∣thren. well know thou whosoeuer thou art, this is thy duty, thou en∣ioying health and prosperity, thou art to haue in thee a feeling remembrance of the miseries of others, we haue a notable example in Daniell, though hee himselfe was in great honour preferred aboue all the Princes of Persia, and second to the King, yet when hee saw the captiuity of Gods people still continued, and the people of God still oppressed by the heathen, his heart was heauy, his soule melted within him, and hee humbled his soule with fa∣sting, Daniel. 9.3. so if thou see or heare that the people of God, or any one of Gods children are in bonds, or any way afflicted, thy selfe enioying liberty and freedom from the like affliction, and hauing cause of reioycing for thy prosperity, thy heart ought to be resolued into sorrow, for their affliction, and to be touched with a feeling of it, and thou art to expresse thy sorrow by prayers and teares, and to reach out thy helping hand vnto them as occasion shall be offered vnto thee, and know thus much, that if thine heart be so taken vp with the consideration of thine owne prosperity that sorrow for the affliction of others cannot enter into it, yea such sorrow as will breake out into pray∣ers and teares, certainely thy hart is not right within thee. One thing yet remaines which is offered vnto vs from this precept (remember my bonds,) the Apostle would haue the Colossians remember his bonds by making vse of them to themselues for their owne confirmation in the truth of the Gospell, the point from hence is this. Other mens sufferings for the Gospell seene or heard of by vs should become profitable to vs, they should make vs
more firmely cleaue to the trueth of the Gospell,We are to profit by the afflictions of others that are knowne to vs. How wee are to profit by them. more soundly to professe it, yea thereby we should be the more moued to renounce the vanities of the world, from which we are called by the voice of the Gospell. And consider wee but thus much, haue and doe the Saints of God suffer much for the profession of the Gos∣pell; yea haue holy martyrs endured extreame torments, and shed their bloud for the truth of the Gospell? and can∣not or do not these things seene or heard of moue thee to leaue the vanities of the world, and more soundly and sin∣cerely to professe the truth of the Gospell? surely then thou hast not profited by the consideration of their sufferings as thou oughtest, and one day the suffering of the Saints, and the bloud of the Martyrs shall rise vp in iudgement against thee: see more of this chap. 1.24. Come wee to the Apostles prayer, with which he shuts vp his Epistle it being (indeed) the last words of his Epi∣stle (grace be with you) his meaning (as before we shew∣ed) in this prayer is thus much, the free and vndeserued loue and fauour of God in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it be with you, so I wish, and I do fully beleeue it shall be so, it may be some may desire for the better vnder∣standing of this prayer, to be informed more particularly what be those fruits, and what bee those tokens of Gods free and vndeserued loue in Christ,The fruites of Gods free loue and fa∣uor in Christ. let them know in a word, that the fruits of it are all spirituall blessings as the Apostle calls them Ephes. 1.3. wherewith the Lord doth blesse his chosen in Christ, belonging to their eternall life and saluation, as (namely) remission of sinnes, Iustificati∣on, adoption, sanctification, &c. and the tokens of that free and vndeserued loue of God in Christ are these,The tokens of Gods free loue and sa∣uor in Christ. the holy meanes of saluation vouchsafed and made effectuall to Gods chosen by the operation of his Spirit, the sence and feeling of Grace in their hearts, temporal good things rightly and purely vsed. One grace or good thing taken away from them, and supplied by an other vouchsafed
vnto them, affliction sanctified and made profitable to them and the like, and so this prayer of the Apostle (grace be with you) comprehends a desire of much good to the Colossians. And thus more fully vnderstanding the words, come we to the matter of instruction hence offred; and first in that the Apostle concludes with this petition only, (Grace be with you) in that he wisheth to the Colos∣sians no other good thing but this, that Gods free grace & loue might be with them, we may easily gather thus much That nothing is more excellent, or more to bee wished  for, then the grace of God in Christ, the free and vndeser∣ued fauor of God in Christ,Nothing is more to be desired and sought after then the free grace and fa∣uor of God in Christ. with the fruits and tokens of it, is to be desired and sought after as the chiefest good thing and aboue all things whatsoeuer. Wee haue a notable example to this purpose in Dauid, Psalm. 4.6.7. there be many that say who will shew vs any good? but Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs. Thou hast giuen me more ioy of heart, then they haue had, when their wheat and wine did abound, as if hee had said, let others in the world desire, and seeke after what they will, as riches, pleasures, honours, and the like, my chiefe desire is of the grace and fauour of the Lord, Lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vppon mee, therein stands my chiefe ioy and comfort, yea I finde more true ioy and comfort in that, then in the increase of corne and wine, and in all the riches of the world. Thus also stood Paul affected, Philip. 3.8. hee counted all things but losse, for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things losse, and doe iudge them to be doung, that I might winne Christ, vers. 9. and that he might be found in Christ, and so in the fauour of God thorough him, and there bee many reasons of this why the grace and fauour of God in Christ should be desi∣red and sought after aboue all other things. First, the grace and fauor of God in Christ is proper and peculiar to Gods children: riches & outward good things
are common to them with the wicked. Secondly the grace and fauour of God in Christ is the roote and ground of all good things profitable and com∣fortable in this life, and in the life to come, it doth intitle vs to all the comforts and good things of this life, and of the life to come, there is no good thing belonging to this life or the life to come, that comes from any other cause or ground but from the grace and fauour of God in Christ, without that we haue no title to the least blessing or good thing whatsoeuer, no not the least crumme of bread: and Thirdly, the grace and fauour of God in Christ, is that alone which doth season and sweeten all the outward things of this life, and makes them truly comfortable, and indeed blessings vnto vs, without which, they are but an heape of miseries, & (as the Preacher speakes in the booke of Ecclesiastes) accursed vanities and bitter vexations of spirit, giuen to make men more inexcusable, and to plunge them into deeper condemnation. These reasons doe sufficiently cleare it, that the grace and fauor of God in Christ is to be desired and sought after aboue all other things, and let not this be a matter of spe∣culation, a matter of knowledge onely.  Let vs not onely know it that the grace and fauor of God in Christ is a most excellent thing, but let the consideration of the excellen∣cy of it affect our hearts and soules, and make vs breath and seeke after it aboue all things in the world,Our harts are to be affected with the ex∣cellency of Gods grace & fauour in Christ, that we may seeke after it aboue all other things. it is the common course of the most in the world, to toyle and moyle, to trudge vp and downe night and day, farre and neere, seeking after wealth, honour, pleasures, preferment, &c. but as for the fauour of God in Christ, they regard it not, they haue little or no care to finde any assurance of that at all. Well, wee must not onely bee able to speake of the grace and fauour of God in Christ, and to commend it, and say, oh it is better worth then all the riches in the world, but the excellency of it must stirre vs vp to desire it, and to spend both time and strength in seeking after it a∣boue
all other things, and this wee shall neuer doe till wee finde our selues to stand in need of it, wee must finde our selues to stand in extreame need of Gods grace and fauour in Christ.We must find our selues to stand in ex∣tream need of Gods grace & fauour in Christ. Happily some will say, is there any that thinks he stands not in neede of Gods grace and fauour in Christ? Indeed euery one in generall termes will say hee is a sin∣ner, and will confesse that he stands in need of Gods grace in Christ, but yet many find not themselues to stand in ex∣treame need of it, and that may thus appeare: do not ma∣ny in the world account great sinnes, little sinnes, and lit∣tle sinnes no sinnes at all? doe they not esteeme Sabbath breaking, customary swearing, idle and foolish talking, pet∣ty trifling sinnes? and if they be reproued for these sinnes, be not their answers ready? doe you make this so great a matter, a little working in the morning on the Sabbath, selling of a triflle on that day, now and then swearing and iesting a little? why, this is nothing, I pray God I neuer do worse, and then I hope I shall doe well enough, and as for such as make conscience of these things, and carefully seek after assurance of Gods grace and fauour in Christ, doe they not load them with odious and reproachfull nick∣names, calling them puritanes, hypocrites, dissemblers and the like? Now what bee these things (I beseech you) but plaine euidences, and demonstrations, that howsoe∣uer many say they are sinners, and they stand in need of Gods grace in Christ, yet they thinke they stand not in so great need of it as indeed they doe? Labour we therefore to finde our selues to stand in extreame neede of the grace of God in Christ, and to find our selues without that in a most miserable case, in respect of the least of our sinnes, and finding our great need of Gods grace in Christ, let vs hunger and thirst after it aboue all things in the world, and be stirred vp carefully to vse the meanes that serue to work and increase assurance of Gods grace and fauour towards vs, and to seale it vp in our hearts, as namely, frequent and
diligent hearing, reading and meditating in the worde of God, prayer, vse of the Sacraments and the like, and yet further to stirre vs vp to affect the grace of God in Christ, and to seeke after it aboue all other things, consider these things. 1 First, if a man bee as wealthy as euer was Salomon,Two motiues to stir vs vp to affect Gods grace in Christ, and to seeke after it aboue al other things. so that gold be as plentifull with him as chips or stones in the street, and he enioyes that wealth all his life, which is very vncertaine, as Iob saith 18.15. Brimstome is scattered on the house of the wicked, it is fit matter for Gods ven∣geance, if the fire of Gods wrath but touch it, it kindles presently and consumes all, but suppose hee enioy his wealth for the space of foure score yeares, or an hundred yeares, yet if he want the grace of God in Christ, hee is sure to haue hell for euer, and hee that loseth his soule for the gaine of all the world, hath but a miserable bargaine. 2 Againe, consider wee that it is not all the wealth in the world that can doe vs any good in time of distresse of conscience, and in the pangs of death; no, no, when a man is galled with the gripes of a guilty conscience, it is not all the world (if it were his) that could purchase the least dramme of that comfort Gods children finde in their sealed apprehension of Gods fauour towards them, and it is onely that that will minister comfort in time of distresse of mind, and in the hower of death, and therefore learne thou to prize the grace of God in Christ as it ought to bee prized, and let thy heart bee set on it as the most excellent thing in the world. Labour to see thy selfe stand in extream need of it, hunger and thirst after it, and seeke for it aboue all things, and neuer rest seeking till thou find some assu∣rance that it belongs to thee. And that thou bee not deceiued remember the tokens of it before spoken of. Neuer rest till thou finde the holy meanes of saluation powerfull vnto thee to thy true con∣uersion, and to the working of grace in thee, and that thou hast some feeling of grace in thine heart, and that if the
Lord giue thee temporall good things, thou hast also power to vse them aright, and dost vse them purely, with praier, and to right ends; not to riot, pride, and to wan∣tonnesse, but to the glory of God, and to the good of thy selfe, and others, and that if the Lord take away some good things from thee, hee supplies it another way; as if he take from thee health, wealth, or the like, yet he makes supply, by giuing thee patience, and contentment, and that if thou be afflicted, thy afflictions are sanctified vnto thee, and thou art made better by them, and if thou finde these and the like tokens, comfort thy selfe, and assure thy selfe, Gods grace and fauour in Christ belongs to thee; and howsoeuer these,Note. and the like tokens and signes of Gods grace, and the sense of it in thine heart, may bee lost for a time, yet Gods fauour it selfe can neuer bee lost, but when all other things faile thee, that will stand by thee, and continue with thee for euer. In the next place note we in a word, that our Apostle begunne with his wish of grace, to the Colossians, Cap. 1.2 Grace be with you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ: and heere hee endes with the same wish, Grace be with you. Teaching vs thus much. That the free grace of God is the beginning and the end of all, it is all in all in the matter of our saluation.Gods free grace is all in all in the mat∣ter of salua∣tion. And this may be easily further confirmed, for why? Election is of grace, Rom. 11.5. Vocation is of grace, 2 Tim. 1.9. Iustifi∣cation is freely by grace, Rom. 3.24. Faith is of grace, Phil. 2.13. Eternall life and saluation is of grace, Rom. 6.23.  And all being thus of grace, where then is any place for mans merit,Mans merit hath no place in that matter of saluation. that our aduersaries, the Papists, hold and maintaine? Certainely Gods free grace and mans merit cannot stand together; if all bee of grace, there can bee no workes of preparation, meriting ex congruo (as they speake) not any worke meriting ex condigno, these bee but dreames, and deuices of idle braines.
I leaue them, and come to the last word, (Amen) In which the Apostle, as we shewed) signifies his desire of the things he praied for, and testifies his assurance to obtaine them. Touching desire in praier, I haue heretofore spoken. Now concerning assurance of obtaining things praied for, signified in this word (Amen) know thus much. That wee must come to the Lord in praier with assu∣rance  to bee heard,We must pray to the Lord with assurance to be heard. wee must be able to say Amen to our praiers: assent and affiance of heart must goe with the re∣quest of our lips made to the Lord, wee must by faith rest on God, for the accomplishment of the things wee haue heartily dersied. Marke 11.24. Saith Christ, whatsoeuer yee desire when yee pray, beleeue that yee shall haue it, and it shall be done vnto you. Iam. 1.6. But let him aske in faith, and wauer not. And that wee erre not touching this point, know that our faith in praier must rest on the promise of God,Faith in praier must rest on Gods pro∣mise. and must beleeue the Lord will grant the things wee pray for, as he hath promised them, the good things of this life, if the giuing of them bee for his glory, and our good, and spirituall good things absolutely. Thus must our faith in praier euer haue relation to Gods promise. Some may obiect,  that faith in praier is not alwaies needefull, for God sometimes heares vnbeleeuers, Psalm. 107. Dauid shewes at large, that when men are in distresse and misery, both beleeuers, and vnbeleeuers, they cry vn∣to the Lord, and hee deliuers them out of their distresse; he giues there many instances, therefore it may seeme that faith is not alwaies necessarie in praier, to make it accepta∣ble to God? Answer:  God doth sometimes releeue the oppressed, and heare their groanes and cries, though they bee vnbe∣leeuers, not because their praiers doe please him, and are acceptable to him, but for the execution of his iustice vp∣on such as wrong them. Iam. 5.4. Behold the hire of the labourers which haue reaped your fields (which is of you kept
backe by fraude) crieth, and the cries of them which haue reaped, are entred into the eares of the Lord of hoasts. It is thence cleare, that oppression, and defrauding of the poore, bee crying sinnes, and the cries of the oppressed bring downe Gods vengeance on their oppressors, God doth sometimes heare the cries and complaints of vnbe∣leeuers,Two causes why God sometimes heareth the cries of vnbe∣leeuers. regarding their cause (namely) their wrongs, and oppressions, not their persons, or praiers: and this he doth for two causes. 1 First, to set foorth the greatnesse of his mercy, that reacheth euen to vnbeleeuers, as hee suffers the Sunne to shine, and the raine to fall on the iust and on the vniust, Math. 5.45. so he doth not contemne the teares of them whose cause is iust, and cals for iudgement, though them∣selues be wicked. 2 Secondly, God sometimes heares the complaints of vnbeleeuers, regarding their cause, not their persons, or praiers, thereby to stirre vp true beleeuers to call on him more earnestly, when they see that euen the cries and the teares of the wicked are not fruitlesse, it is a notable in∣ducemcement to stirre vp true beleeuers to bee earnest in praier. And let the consideration of it stir thee vp that art a true beleeuer, euen to come to the Lord in the praier of faith.Gods mercie to vnbelee∣uers conside∣red must stirre vp true belee∣uers to come to the Lord in the praier of faith. Doth the Lord sometimes heare the cries and complaints of vnbeleeuers, which haue no promise made vnto them? Then doe thou remember the promise of God made to thee, and rest vpon it by faith, according to the tenour of it, say Amen to thy praiers. Let the assent and affiance of thine heart goe together with thy voice, and then vn∣doubtedly the Lord according to his promise, will heare and grant thy request. From the word Amen, some obiect on this manner. Say they, it is an Hebrew word, and so a word of a tong vnknowne to the common sort, and yet it is vsed by them in praier; why then may they not vse many words of an
vnknowne tongue, and a whole praier in an vnknowne tongue? Answer:  Though the word (Amen) bee a word of an vnknowne tongue, yet by vse it is become as familiar as any other English word, and therefore this makes nothing for the defence of Popish praier in an vnknowne tongue. Soli Deo gloria. FINIS.
