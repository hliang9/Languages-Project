207 Such Innes as have been erected since the making of Statute, 5. E. 6. 23. ought to have li∣cence, and be bound with sureties, as Ale∣house-keepers, Dalt. 26. Crmp. 77. 208 Common Innes are for travellers, & not for neighbours; (the Latine word diversorium, quasi se divertens à via, implying so much) and therfore if a neighbour, which is no traveller, at the request of an hostler lodge there, & his goods be stollen, he shall not have an action, &c for the writ is, ad hospitandū homines trans∣euntes, &c. Co. lib. 8. fol. 32. in Catey's case. 209 If any hostler refuse a guest if he may conve∣niently lodge him, and his house be not full, the guest may have an action upon the case for refusall, Dyer, 158. or he may compell him to lodge him, 5. E. 4. 2. And yet it seemeth that any Inne-keeper may refuse to lodge any one after nine of the clock at night, Statute Winch Anno 13. E. 1. 210 If a man come into a Tavern, and will not
depart thence again in reasonable time, being reqred, he doth wrong to the party, 9.

Stat. 18. E. 6. 2. 213 The trade of Brewer is an Art or Mistery, Co. lib. 8 129. and none may brew without a li∣ence, or who hath been prentice, Soi's case. 214 Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Escheatours, Coroners, and their ministers are bound to serve all precepts to them directed from Iustices of the peace without fees, Statut. 1. H. 4. 11. Fitz. Just. fol. 17. b. Westm. 127. Stat. 23: H. 6. 10. alloweth the Sheriffe twenty ence, the Bailiff for the arrest foure pence,
and foure pence for a bail-bond. 215 But that Statute giveth no new fees to the Sheriffs, but doth curb him that he do not take excessively, where a fee byprescription may be challenged; but he cannot prescribe because his office is annuall, and no office of Inheri∣tance, See 42. E. 3. fol. 4. Brook, title Fees, 18. 216 A Justice of peace was created since the time of memory, and therfore he cannot pre∣scribe for that office, See 34. H. 6. fol. 36. Broo prescription, 36. 217 If any man shall contract Matrimony wit a woman under sixteene yeares without con∣sent of her Parents or Guardians, fine and im¦prisonment, Stat. 4. & 5. Ph. & Mar. 218 If any man which is not able or sufficie to keep a servant shall retaine a servant, such retainer is voyd, Dalton, pag. 63. Fitz. N. 168. b.
219 Retaining of a servant without expressing what term shall be for a yeare, 5. Elis. 4. Dal. 64 220 If a servant refuse to do his service, this is a departure in Law, although he continue still with his master, 3. H. 6. fol. 37. Dalt. 64. 5. Elis. 4 two Iustices of peace may commit him. 221 If the Master shall detain from his servant his wages, meat or drink, this is a good cause of departing, Fitz. N. B. 168. Dalt. 64. 222 If any retain a servant for fourty dayes, and another retain him for a yeare, the first cove∣nant is voyd, because it is not according to the Statute, Fitz. N.B. 169. Crmpton, 121. b. 223 A woman retained in service doth marry, yet she must serve out her covenant, Crompton, 121. Fitz. N.B. 169.
224 Every person which hath not sufficient land to occupy or live upon, or no other Art, i compellable to serve, Fitz. N. B. 168. Dalton, 63 for the Law abhorreth idlenesse. 225 Every Iustice of peace may command vagra persons to prison if they will not serve, Dalto 63. Fitz. N. B. 168. b. And this is by the Com¦mon law, which the Statute doth not restrait 226 No servant may depart from his Master unlesse for some cause allowed before a Iustic of peace, or that he give quarters warning be¦fore two witnesses; if he do, then two Iustice may commit him untill he shall serve his Ma∣ster again, 5. Elis. 4. 227 And if he be legally freed from his Master yet he cannot depart out of that parish to li as a servant in another, unlesse he have a testi¦moniall, declaring his lawfull departure, 5. E¦is. 4.
228 Nor can he be retained by any other under 5 pound by the retainer, and the servant to be imprisoned untill he procure a testimoniall of his lawfull departure out of that parish, which if he cannot do within 12 dayes, he is to be punished as a vagrant, 6. Elis. 4. and the retai∣ning is void. 229 An Apprentice to be bound by virtue of Sta∣tute, 5. Elis. 4. must be above the age of 10 years ander 18. But it seemeth by Statute, 43. Elis. 2. that Overseers may bind out to be apprentices any which are burthensome to their parents, though within the age of 10 years, if their pa∣rents be not able to maintain them: 230 An apprentice cannot be discharged by his Master, except by writing, Dalton, nor bound without deeds; but it seemeth by Statute, 21. Jac. 31. that any man may assigne over his apprentice unto another. 231 An Infant, or feme Covert may commit a force, and may be fined: but it seemeth that
such fine set upon the wife shall not be levied upon the husband, Dalt. 171. Cok. lib. 11: fol. 61. 232 A Iustice of peace may commit and fine such as he shall find, making any force, Dalt. 41 42 but he cannot in any case make restitution without an inquiry by a lury, Dalt. 42, 44, 45. 233 He may take away their weapons, harnesse and armour, and presently cause them to be prised, and after to be answered to the King as forfeited, or to the value of them, Dalt. 42. 234 But if such offenders, being in the house at the coming of the Iustice, shall make no resi∣stance, nor make shew of any force, then the¦stice cannot arrest, or remove them, except in the inquiry a force be found, Dalt. 42. 235 The Iustice ought to make a Record of the force by him viewed, which shal be a sufficient conviction of the offenders; and the parties
shall not be allowed to traverse it. And then also he must fine, and that severally, not joynt∣ly; and after estreat the same or else certifie the Record into the Sessions, and there the offen∣ders may be fined; or into the Kings Bench, which is best of all out of that Court, Dalton, 42, 43. 236 If upon the inquest such forcible holding be found, then the Iustice shall restore the posses∣sion of the party outed (but the putting out must of necessity be found, and by expresse (words) or else he may make his precept to the Sherif to do it, or certifie the indictment into the Kings Bench, and leave it to be awarded out of that Court, Dalt 44, 45. 237 A Iustice may make restitution notwithstan∣ding any offer of traverse; but yet upon traverse tendred, the safest way for him seemeth to be to deliver or to certifie the presenment in the Kings Bench, and so refer the further proceed∣ing therein, Dalt. 45. See Stat. 21. Jac. 238 Vpon payment of the said fine to the Iu∣stices,
or upon surety found by Recognizance for payment thereof, the Iustice may deliver the offenders out of prison again, Dalton, 45. Lamb. 159. But it is better refer it to the Ses∣sions again. 239 Though the Iustice of peace ought to com∣mit, and may fine all such as he shall see con∣tinuing the force at his coming to the place, (yet upon force found by inquiry only, and not viewed or seen by the Iustice) and although the presentment of the Iury be a conviction of the offenders, yet it seemeth the Iustice may neither fine nor sent to the gaol the said offen∣ders by Statute, 8. H. 6. which appointed the inquity: for the Iustice hath power by the said Statute only to make restitution, Dalton, 45. Lamb. 158. 240 If divers come with weapons not usually born by them to an house that is open, or to a ground, and there shall enter peaceably with∣out any disturbance, yet this is a forcible en∣try: for it shall be intended that they would have used force if they had been resisted, Dalt. 167. Lamb. 143.
421 To enter a house, the doore being latched, peaceably, is no force, Dalt. 169. Lamb. 143. 242 In case of forcible Entries, Riots, &c. the offence being found upon inquity, the Iustices before whom it is found, have authority to make proces against the offenders under their own teste, and to commit the offenders, untill they have paid the fine, or given surety for it, and to deliver them upon payment of it; and those Iustices may receive the traverse of the parties, Dalt. 127. But whether these may try the traverse out of the Sessions, it is doubtful Dalton, 166. 243 One may commit a force, Dalton, 166. Lamb. 143. Omnes illos dicimus Armaos, qui habent quocum nocere possunt, Lamb. 104. 244 A forcible Entry cannot he judged against a man without an actuall Entry be also made by him, Dalt. 167. Lamb. 141.
245 If a man have a Rent or Common in lands, and he is so forcibly resisted by the Tenant, that he dare neither distrain for the one, not use the benefit of the other; this is a holding with force, punishable by this Statute, Lamb. 146. But this must be understood of the for∣cible detaining of the possession it selfe, and not of the person; for that is a false imprison∣ment. 246 Every force punishable by Iustices of peace must be, either Manu forti, or, cum multitudine; manu forti, viz. with apparent violence in deed or word offered to the person of another, or threatning speeches, or actuall violence, or els that they be furnished with offensive weapons by them not usually worn, See Dalt. 166. 247 Any private man may arrest a Felon, and commit him to the common gaol, 20. E. 4. 6. fol 6. Stat. 3. H. 7. cap. 3. 248 If a Iustice of peace heare of any Rioters, he may either alone or with his servants go
to the place, and such as he finds riotously as∣sembled and armed, he may arrest to find sure∣ty for their good abearing, and may commit them to prison if they refuse to give it, and take their weapons from them, Lamb. 180. 249 If any Riot, assembly, or rout of people, be made against the Law, the Iustices of peace, 3 or 2 of them at least, dwelling most nigh to the place, and the Sheriffe or under Sheriff of the County, shall come with the power of the County if need be, & shall arrest them: & they have power to record that which they shall find so done in their presence against the Law, Stat 13. H. 4. 7. And by that Record such of∣fenders shall be committed in manner and form as is contained in the Statute for Entries. viz. 15. R. 2. . 250 And if such trespassor be departed from thence before their coming, then those Iustices, three or two of them, shall diligently inquire within a month after of such Riot, and there∣of shall heare and determine according to the Law of the land. And if the truth may not be found upon inquiry, they are to certifie the
same within a month, upon pain of a hundred pound, Stat. 13 H. 4. cap. 7. 251 All the Kings people which are able, shall be assistant to the Iustices and the Sheriffs, being reasonably warned, upon pain of imprison∣ment and fine, 2. H. 5. 8. 252 Rioters must be arrested while the Riot is in committing, or presently after: for the Iu∣stices can make no proces upon their Record, if the Rioters escape, but must send their Record into the Kings Bench, that processe may be there made upon it, Poult. fol. 29. §. 29. 253 If they see the Riot, and the Rioters escape, they must Record it, but they cannot make processe upon their record, neither ought the Record to be kept amongst the Records of the peace, but sent into the Kings Bench, that pro∣cesse may be there made, Lamb. 235. 254 If the Iustices, Sheriff, &c. do not go to
see the Riot, yet may the Iustices inquire of it within a month; and they all are to make cer∣tificat within a month after, Lamb. 237. 255 If two Iustices and the Sheriffe go to see a Riot, and other two Iustices make inquiry, now the one or the other sort of them with the Sheriff or under Sheriff may certifie the same, Lamb. 237. 256 If the inquiry be within the month, and the Iustices do give day to the sury to yield their verdict after the month, that is good enough, Lamb. 237. The Iustices in such a case must send for the Sheriff.
Certain Resolutions delivered by the Judges upon the Statute concern∣ing the Poore and Rogues. A Rogue affirmeth he was born in such a Town, in such a County, then he ought to be sent thither; and if he were not borne there, he is said to be anincorrigible Rogue, and is to be sent thence to the house of Correcti∣on; and if there be not a house of Correcti∣on in those parts, to the Goal, untill the next Sessions, there to be dealt withall according to the Statute. The same course is to be taken if it doth not appear where he was born, or if he untru∣ly affirme that he was last dwelling in such a Town by the space of a year, and was not. If the husband and wife have a house, and the husband and wife do rogue abroad, they ought to be sent to that Town where that house is: and so of an inmate. Quaere sor In∣mates in some cases are against the Law: I think an Inmate by the appointment of the ustices, 43. Elis. The wife and children under seven years of
age, being vagrant, must go and be placed with the husband: if the husband be dead, then the wife where she was born and dwelt, and the vagrant children above seven years of age must be sent to the place of their birth. And if the vagrant parents with their children under 7 years of age be placed at the place of the birth of the parents, or at the place of their last dwelling (as the case shall fall out) if after∣wards the parents or either of them dye or run away, yet the children once settled, must remain there still, and may not be sent to the place of their birth, though afterwards they grow above the age of seven years. The wife being a vagrant Rogue ought to be sent to the husband, yea though he be but a servant in another town: The Rogue whose place of birth or dwel∣ling cannot be known, & hath wife, and chil∣dren under seven years of age; they must go with the husband to the place where they were last wilfully suffered to passe without pu∣nishment, where the children must be relieved by the work of their Parents, though the Pa∣rents be committed to the house of correctiō. If any not being Rogues shall travell with their children through a town, and their father or mother dye or run away, the town where they dye is not bound to keep them, nor to send them away, but only in charity, except they become wandring Rogues.
If the Parents be able to work, and may have work, they are to find their children by their labours, and not the Parish: But if they be overburdened with children, it shall be a good way to procure some of them to be bound out apprentices. None is to be put out of the town where he dwelleth, or sent to the place of birth or last dwelling, but only a vagrant rogue. Such are not to be found by the town except thy be impotent, but ought to set themselvs on work if they be able and can get work; if they can∣not, then the overseers must set them to work. And so of them which have or shal have houses when their estates be expired, and servants whose time of service is expired, though they cannot get houses, yet they must provid them∣selves of houses if they be not impotent. Such persons as be of any parish, and have able bodies to work, and be no wanderers a∣broad out of the parish, though they refuse to work at such rates as are taxed or commonly given in those parts, are not to be sent to the place of their birth or last dwelling by the space of a yeare, but to the house of correction. But if they have any lawful means to live by, though they be of able bodies, and refuse to work, yet they are not to be sent to the house of correction.
Such as will remove or put out of their pa∣rish those that are not to be put out, do against the Statute of the poore, and are finable, 39. Elis. 4. If any be sent to the Town where he ought to be sent, and is refused, being a sturdy and impudent Rogue, the parties refusing and the parties refused is to be offered to the Church∣wardens and Overseers: To send Rogues by a generall passe with∣out conveying them from Parish to Parish, is a let to the conveying of Rogues, and so a for∣feiture of five pound, and to go with such a passe, is but still to continue a Rogue to be pu∣nished by whipping.
