¶ By the Queene. FOrasmuch as the Queenes Maiestie our soueraigne Ladie, is credibly en∣formed, that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundrie places in and about the Citie of London, and in other places neere adioyning to the same, whereby the continuance thereof, through the greater repaire and re∣sort of her louing Subiects, great perill and danger might not onely ensue vnto her most royall person, but also vnto her most louing subiects, re∣pairing thither for their suites and causes, and thereby also giue occasion of dispersing of the same in other parts of the Realme: Her Maiestie for the said necessary considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodnesse of Almighty God, with the coolenesse of the yeare, and such wholesome orders as are taken in her said Citie, the rather cease by the adiournement of part of this next tearme of Saint Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the same, vn∣till after the feast of all Saints next comming, of her speciall fauour and clemencie, is pleased and con∣tented, to adiourne the said tearme of saint Michael, that is to say, from the vtas thereof, vnto Crastino aimarum, next comming.

And further her Maiesties pleasure is, that all maters, causes and suites, depending in any of her other Courts betweene partie and partie, as in her Highnesse Courts of Chauncerie, Starre chamber, and Exchequer, Courts of wards and liueries, and Duchie of Lancaster, shall haue coutinuance, and the parties shall haue day from the date of these presents vnto Crastino animarum, as before is said. Prouided alway, and her Maiesties pleasure and commandement is, that all Collectors, Receiuers, Sheriffes, and other accomptants, & all other persons that ought or should accompt or pay any summe or summes of money in any of her Maiesties court of Exchequer, courts of wardes and liueries, or of her Duchie of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any accompt in any of the same courts, shall re∣paire vnto the accustomed places at Westminster, where her Highnesse hath appointed such officers and ministers, as for that purpose her Maiestie hath thought expedient, and there to pay, and doe in euery behalfe, as though no such Proclamation of adiournement had bene had or made: any thing mentioned in this present proclamation, or in any writ of adiournement to the contrary, notwithstanding. Willing and commanding all and euery of her Maiesties officers, ministers and subiects, to whom it doth or shall appertaine, to obserue and keep their assemblies and apparances, with all their returnes and certificats in her Hignesse said Courts at Westminster in Crastino animarum next comming, then and there to bee holden and kept, and there to do their offices and dueties in euery behalfe, in like manner and forme as they should or ought to haue done, if this present Proclamation had not bene had or made, as they will answere to the contrary at their perils. Giuen at her Maiesties Honor of Hampton Court the first day of October, in the sixtenth yeere of her Maiesties Raigne. ¶ God saue the Queene. ¶ Imprinted at London by Newgate Market, next vnto Christs Church, by Richarde Iugge, Printer to the Queenes Maiestie, Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
