An Epistle of Love, and of Consolation unto Israel, from the pouring forth of the Spirit, and holy Anointing of the Father, sent in Bowels of tender Love, unto the Cho∣sen and Elect Seed of Life, &c. A Trumpet sounded out of the Holy City, pro∣claiming the day of Salvation, and of Sions Redemption; and this is to go abroad, as sent of the Father, as the greetings of Love and Life, unto his own Begotten, unto whom the free streams of the pure eternal Fountain floweth, from the fulness of the Treasures of Gods Wisdom, which abundantly is mul∣tiplyed and increased in the habitations of the Faith∣ful; yea, the City of the living God, new Jerusalem is come down from above, the blessed Habitation, in which floweth the everlasting streams of Love and Consolation; the Kingdom of Glory is revealed, the Son of Righteousness is risen in his Beauty, in his trans∣parent Brightness, the Glory of all Nations is come; and this is the Day, wherein the Lord God is binding up his Jewels, in the bond of Life, in the tye of his own Spirit; and the Lamb is come to Reign of his Temple, and blessed are all who are waiting for him, and for his glorious Appearance, who is coming with Power and with great Glory, to Reign in his eternal Majesty; yea, the Son of Peace and of Consolation is come, the express Image of the Fathers Glory, the ve∣ry Substance of all things, the end of the Prophets, the ministration of Life, which all are to feel within the holy Mountain of God; where the Table is spread,
where the Feast of fat things is prepared, where Ja∣cobs Well is set open, where the streams of the pure Fountain freely flow in the still Habitation. Oh, the vertue of the Life of the Love of God! feel the Breast of everlasting Consolation, draw, drink abundantly; there is no end of this pure River, whose Waters are as clear as Chrystal; and from the Throne of the most Holiest, the waters slow plentifully; in the glorious dwelling-place, in the Habitation of Israels God, with∣in the Tents of Jacob, where the harmony of Angels is heard, where the sound of the holy One is uttered forth; in the midst of the Temple of God, in the Hea∣ven of Heavens, where the Turtle-Doves do flie from the Throne of his Glory, whose Majesty and Bright∣ness hath ravished my heart. And the Lord God hath spoken, and therefore I will speak, for God hath unloosed my tongue, to speak to the praise of his Name, who is the great and won∣derful Counsellor, the mighty God of Israel, the holy One, in the midst of the Tents of Jacob, where Glory and Peace possesseth her dwelling places, the Kingdom that is without end: God hath revealed the Kingdom, which consisteth in Power and Life; so all are to come who believe in that Power which createth anew in Christ Jesus; that Power which reneweth into the Image and likeness of God, as in the beginning; for God planted his Lilly in his own Paradise, which Lilly sometimes grew among the Thorns; so all are to feel the good Husband-man, to pluck up the Thorns, that so the Lilly may grow and increase, and over-spread the earth; and this Lilly God will cloath with a more glorious Garment, with a more beautiful Raiment,
than Solomon the Wise King was cloathed with; the Robe of Honour, the Garment of Grace, God will put on upon his own Seed the Plant of his renown, and this shall overspread the earth; where briars and brambles have grown, there shall the Lilly grow, and there shall the voice of the Turtle sing; and the Winter is passing away, and the Summer is well nigh come, wherein the Lilly begins to appear in the field of plea∣sure, after the frosty Winter, after the dark howling Night; for out of the Wilderness God is leading Israel by the hand, into the good Land, through the Red Sea, in the narrow Way, in the straight Path, where the Holy tread and walk, and are not weary, for the sound of the voice of the glorious God is heard, whole voice giveth Life; and now is the last Trumpet sounded, which hath raised the Dead, which hath opened the Graves, and the dissolving Power of the Lord God, is dissolving Hell and Death; so that Power which raiseth the Dead to Life, all are to press after, to be raised there∣by unto the Resurrection of Life; so the breathing Pow∣er, the inlivening quickning Spirit of the second Adam, all are to wait in, to hear the voice of the Shepherd of Israel, whose voice the Living come to hear, who are raised to Life thereby: And this is the day of the Lord God, wherein he hath appeared in everlasting and eter∣nal glorious Brightness, who is breaking open the depths of the Mysteries of his own Kingdom, which Mysteries are revealed in the hearts of the Faithful, who know the Key of David, which shuts and opens, which reveals and seals; and blessed are all who dwell in the Life, of the Holy Lamb, such know the sweet Consolation, such know the pure Fountain of Life, which is Eternal
Love, such are Born of Love; and this is the Birth which is brought forth thorough the Travel, thorough Death, thorough the Tribulation; the Life of the Lamb of God is raised, which Life must Reign, for God is advancing his chosen Seed, God is establishing it on the Throne of David, in the Ark of his most holy Treasure, where his secret walkings are known; and the Word of the Lord God is a burning and a shining Light, which Light is the Leader of Israel, the Star of Jacob, which goeth before the Followers of the Lamb, and this is Israels Leader, the Light, the Truth, the Life: who are led by it into all Truth, such know the Promise of the Father fulfil∣ed in them, such know the pouring forth of the Spirit, the holy Anointing; such are they who are taught of the Lord, who are establisht in the Kingdom of God, who know the windows of Heaven opened, and the Rain descending, who know the Prophesies of the Sprit of Life; such are come to the everlasting Prophet, the High Priest of God, the Wise Counsellor, the King of all Nations, who ruleth all things by the Word of his Au∣thority, who rebuketh the Waters, and turneth the Waves backward; and blessed are all, who know him in the Vessel, who ariseth to rebuke the Waves, when the Waters swell and are troubled, then hath his voice spoken Peace; and this is known in the, Way to Life, and this many must come to know, before they enter into the Land of Rest, before they enter into the King∣dom of God, which I say is come unto; they who have waited, who have believed in the Light, such receive the Life, who in the Light wait, in the silence, in the still Habitation, such come to hear the voice of their Be∣loved, such come to be cloathed with the Righteousness
of God: but first all must know the putting off, the strip∣ping, the purifying, the dying, and so the change is wrought by the unchangeable Word, by which all things are made anew, and a new Life is brought forth; and this is the very substance of all Profession, to know the Kingdom of God revealed, and to know the Son of God to bear Rule in the heart, who is come to Reign, and to cast out the unclean Spirits; so all must come to know the effectual working of the Divine Power of Life, which worketh in the Love, which Love destroyes death, which breaketh the cords thereof; and all who come to know the working of the nature of Love, are brought into the nature of its Life, Likeness, and Image; so here where the work of God goeth on, there is the rejoycing known, because of the Glory which shineth in from Gods most holy Providence, where the streams of his Life flow continually this maketh all to rejoyce and to sing for joy of heart, for the Bridegroom is come, the Virgins have met him, and the Damosels dance at the glory of his Brightness, who heareth the sound of the Harp of David, where the new Songs are heard, where the Turtle sings, where our Beloved rejoyceth, because of the smiles of the Fathers lovely countenance, whose beau∣tiful appearance exceedeth in Glory, whose Majesty reigneth, whose Kingdom is come, and a glorious sound is gone forth as a mighty shout; therefore let the Righ∣teous rejoyce, and let the Inhabitants of Jerusalem be glad, let the Heavens and the tops thereof shout, for a mighty King is in the midst, the Reign of the God of Israel is come; and therefore this was upon my heart, to sound forth the day of Sions Redemption: And this was the voice that run thorough me, that Sions Re∣demption
draweth nigh, wherein her Converts shall sing for Joy of heart, for the ravishing Glory of God did overshadow me, and the Word of Eternal Life run thorough me, often saying, Publish the day of the Lord God, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, as a mighty shout; and this is to go thorough this Nation, as it was given into me, for this very end, to send it with speed, as the everlasting Message of Life, as the greetings of Peace, by the Word of Salvation: And the Truth of the Lord I must spread, for the Lord God hath lighted my Candle, and it must not be hid; and thus saith the Spirit of Truth, Publish the day of the Lord God; and in the free Authority of the Spirit of Life, I send this Message of Truth by the streams of Love, from the Son of Love and of Consolation, whose day is come, whose Name shall sound thorough the Nations, and many shall be gathered to walk in the Light of Sion, who shall have a Habitation in the Tents of Jacob, in Je∣rusalem; the City of the Faithful, and Beloved of God; for many shall be gathered in this glorious day, for God is set∣ting of the Seed of Sion free: And the Free-born Chil∣dren shall inherit the Land of Promise, the Seed of Abraham, who are born of the Birth of God, who are Heirs of the Kingdom and Crown of Life: These are they who are of the number of God, who are the Lambs Army, who follow him wheresoever he goeth; for the Lion of the Tribe of Judah hath roared with a voice of Thunder, sounding forth the day of the Lord God, unto the Inhabitants of the Earth, that they may ha∣sten into the Ark of God, before the Flood cometh; for verily I do declare what I have seen: A Flood shall come suddenly, and blessed are all who prepare into the in∣tired Life; who are found in that day to be of the num∣ber
of God, who are marked with the Lambs Mark, who are sealed with the Seal of Life: And in the Au∣thority of the Divine Majesty of the holy Wise God, I do declare the day of the Lord which is coming, which is glorious to the Righteous, but the day which is torrible to the unrighteous; and unutterable is the Glory of the day of the Lord, that shall shine in the Habitations, and in the Tents of Israel; for Christ our Life is risen, and arising and appearing in Glory, and we shall appear in Glory with him, and he will glorifie his with the same Glory that he had with the Father, be∣fore the world was yea, Crowns of Lite, Robes of Righteousness, Garments of glorious Praise, are pre∣pared for the Faithful, for the Chosen, who are true Israclites, who are Plants growing in the Paradise of God, who are born of the Seed of the Birth of Life; such shall inherit the Kingdom of everlasting Glory, such shall triumph in Heaven, having the Songs of praises in their mouths, singing with Grace in their hearts, before the Throne of the most Holy, Glorious, Wise God, who is exalting his Name in the Earth, who is establishing his Throne on the tops of the Moun∣tains: on the Throne of David shall the Prince of Life Reign; the Spirit of Life hath filled me with his Love, to declare to you the glorious day of the Lord God, whose Light did shine about me, whose Glory, whose Pretence, whole Life hath filled me, the ver∣tue of the Power seel, the increase of his Love, the ra∣vishing Beauty of the Lord God hath overshadowed the Earth, the Springs of the holy Fountain runneth in the Valleys low, where the praises of God are soun∣ded forth unto his most holy Majesty, in the ami∣able Habitation in the Tents of the glory of God,
where the Sun shineth in his Beauty, where the Lilly of the Life springs up out of the holy Root, the Righteous Branch of David, the Kingdom is come, and the new Songs are known, with praises sounded forth unto the holy One: And in the deep his voice is very sweet, unto the Hungry is Bread, both Life and Meat. Oh! the depth of Love, which death it shall destroy, for the Life is come, which leads the narrow Way; And therefore unto All, I say come away, and prepare unto the glorious day, that into the Fountain of Life, you all may come and drink, and in Marriage to the Lamb, you may both joyn and link: For the Table is both fully spread, the Life is come, which raiseth from the dead; And he is risen, the Na∣tions have to heal'd; Who in this day his Fountain hath unseal'd. And Sions Beauty hath now ravisht me, there∣fore I do sound forth the glorious Day, that all may hear the sound thereof, that they may be gathered that are yet afar off, into the Sheepfold, where Christ is the Shepherd, who feedeth his with ever living Bread, who hath raised many again from the dead, to spread and to publish his most glorious Name, and to sound forth the Beauty of his fame, that many may be gathered, in this the glorious Day, for the voice hath sounded, which saith, come away; for the life of the Lamb is revealed in great Power, in Majesty and Glory, and the singing of Birds is heard, with the voice of the Turtle, is heard within, in this the time of Spring, wherein Summer hath appeared, and now the voice of the Well-beloved is heard; and unto my Beloved, unto Thee, I sweetly sing, as the Turtle in the time of Spring; who for joy that she hath found her Mate, what from thy love shall me seperate? my foul doth swim within the Sea of
love, as doth the fishes in the water move; and there∣by doth live, for it is their life, so to me thou art my joy, & my delight, who art most faithful and most true, holy and wise, who never forsakes thine. And my friends, my love floweth freely unto you, in God most holy, most faithful, and most true; and in the Life you may my love feel, which burns from God in vertue and in zeal; which love to you I do this day sound, which in Ecchoes sweet, Gods glory and renown, I do send forth and declare, being fuller than my life can bear, of the waters out of Jacobs Well, whose waters sweet in vertue doth excel; which as honey out of the Rock doth flow, and as Rain into the Sea doth go, and Gods voice as the Thunder doth flie, is descended forth as lightning from the Skie; that the sound of it the Nations may all hear, that before the mighty God they may both dread and fear: And this is the day wherein the Lord is come, to establish the Kingdom of his glorious Son; who must Reign over all as Head, even he whom God hath raised from the dead; who under the earth hath been slain, but now in Glory is reveal'd again; who will vengeance take on all, who would not that he should Reign; such in the Lake he will throw, with sorrow and with woe: Yea, the day is come, that God most true, will make a separation amongst the Nations, and they that shall be saved, shall walk in the Light of Sion, and in the Beauty and Glory of Jerusalem, the Saints of the most High shall dwell under the shadow of his Love, in the glourious Bright∣ness, in the excellency of his Beauty; for the mighty Day is come, wherein over all God will exalt & glorifie his Son, whose Kingdom & Power is made known, whom God will set again on his most holy Throne; and over
all, as King he shal Reign, & before him his Enemies shall be slain; for the King of all Nations is come, there∣fore let all be subject to the Son. And you Babes of the Morning, who are born of the day of God, this is sent to you all, as the Message of his Love and Life; whose Springs are freely set open, to all the faithful Worshippers of God; this I desire may be published with speed, to go thorow this Nation, as it hath often gone thorow me as a joyful Sound, sent from the King of Israel, to whom be eternal glorious Praises for ever, with Hallelujahs unto the holy One, from whom it is sent and publisht, By Dorathy White, The 20. of the 8. Month, 1661. Unto thee my Beloved, my streams of Love doth slow, as doth the Rain, which into the Sea doth go; and the time is come, wherein the Turtle sings in the Valleys low: And so sweet my streams of Life doth run, in beams of Brightness, descending from the Sun; Glory and Peace doth fully increase, from God most true and just, who is faithful unto all, who in his Name doth trust; and in the pure Life, all his voice may hear, by all that upon him wait, and to him draw neer:This is the day, wherein the Lord is come, with the Bride∣groom, so glorious is the Sun, which is now breaking forth in his glory Bright, to gather the Nations, to walk in his pure Light: This is the day, wherein Sion hath appeared, and her sweet harmonious sounds, the Nations all must hear; whose Glory must overspread the Earth, whole Light leadeth again, and bringeth from
