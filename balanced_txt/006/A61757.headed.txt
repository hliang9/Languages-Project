Strange and Wonderful NEWS FROM BRISTOL BEING A True Relation, how several Sheep were found Killed near that City; their Bellies being Ript Open, and their Fat only taken out of them; all the rest of the Carcass being lest entire, in order (as it is to be Feared) to the Kindling more Dreadful Fires, for carrying on the Horrid and Damnable Popish Plot and Conspiracy for the Destruction of His Majesty, and the Protestant Religion and Government now Establisht by Law. Together, With the Examinations taken thereupon, be∣fore Sir John Lloyd Mayor, Sir Robert Cann, Mr. Alderman Yates, Capt. William Bedloe, and Sheriff Jackson, and many o∣ther of the most Eminent Citizens of Bristol. THose Damnable and Hellish Popish Con∣spirators, who have Designed the Destruc∣tion of His Majesty and Government, and the Religion of this Nation now by Law Establisht, have found no way more Effectual for carrying on this their Horrid Plot, than Fireing; and thereby Impoverishing the Famous City of London, and also the most Considerable Cities and Market To
Kingdom; against some of which they have to Effectually succeeded in their Villany, and have Designed it against all the rest; and this they have performed by several Wayes and Methods; of which Captain William Bedloe hath given a very large and sa∣tisfactory Account, in the late Impartial Narrative of the Fires of London, Westminster, Southwark, and the parts Adjacent, published by him. And among the several Wayes whereby they per∣petrated their Mischiefs; One usual Method was, By Throwing Fire-Balls into Houses, Windows, or any other place where there was Combustible matter fit for their purpose: which Fire-Balls were compounded of several Ingredients; and among the rest, we hear that they generally used a great quantity of Sheeps-Fat taken from the Cawl and Kidneys; and upon this Ac∣count we may well suppose the Reason why we have heard of so many Sheep that have been found Killed in the Fields, having nothing taken from them but only their Fat: And this has been done several Times, and in many Places of this Kingdom, diverse having been found Dead in the same manner in and about London, awhile before the Dreadful Burning thereof; as also a∣bout Northampton before the Fire thereof: Yea, some Sheep (not many Months since) have been found in the same Posture in the County of Surrey, not above Seven or Eight Miles from London. And for the further Confirmation of these their Wicked Practices, we shall now give you this Brief, but True Account, That upon Thursday the Twenty Fourth of this instant July, near the City of Bristol, there were Five Sheep found Dead in the Fields, with their Bellies ript open, and all their Kidney-Fat taken out of them, and the Carcass and Skin, with all the Quar∣ters, was left entire upon the Ground. Upon the Report of this Mischief, there was Com∣plaint made to the Magistrates of the City of Bristol, since it was to be Feared it might prove Dangerous,
because there were Three Stp ides  Killed in the same manner but the Thursday before this that is, upon the Seventeenth of this Month: Whereupon the Mayor of Bristol, with several Aldermen of the same City, and also Captain William Bedloe, took the same into their serious Consideration, and made a strict En∣quiry into the Business; and finding the thing to be True, that so many Sheep had been really destroyed, and found Dead in the manner aforementioned; they immediately issued out Orders, That the Common Watch usually belonging to the City, should be Double the Number as formerly; and that Six of the most Con∣siderable and Substantial House-keepers in each Parish, should Watch every Night in their Own Persons, till further Order to the Contrary: And that all possible Care should be taken by all means, to endeavor to Seize upon these Wretched Incendiaries, that so they might be brought to Condign Punishment for these their Cursed Attempts. And the Reason of this Order was, Because, as we mentioned before, the like Wicked Practices were used before the Fires of London, Southwark, and other Places; For we are told, That this Sheeps Fat, with other Com∣pounds made up into Fire-Balls, are of an Extraordinary furious Burning Quality; so that when they are once Kindled, they cannot be Quenched, till they go out of themselves: And where they are Thrown, they Stick so fast, as not to be Removed, till they have wrought their Cursed Effect. This Relation is most certainly True; and we hope, may Warn us to have a Care of the Cursed Doctrines and Practices of the Romish Church, who allow of Firings, Murtherings, Poysoning, and all other Villanies whatsoever, if it may any way promote their Damnable Cause and Interest. And now Dear Country-men, since your Lives, Liberties, and Estates, are once more put into your own Hands, Let it be your greatest care in the Choice
of your Representatives, for the ensuing Parliament, since a Miscarriage herein, may never be Retrieved: Chuse men of Honesty, Sobriety and Courage; those that may Stand by His Majesty for the Defence of his Sacred Person, and the Protestant Religion and Government Established; Those that may not be Afraid to Search into the Bottom of this Damnable Hellish Plot and Conspiracy, to Destroy His Majesty, and the Laws; Such as may make Provision, that we may not leave a Religion of Blood, Villany, and Slavery to our Posterity: Let not him be counted the Fittest man for your Choice, who gives you the most Drink, and spends the most Money; lest like Cursed Esau, you sell your Birth-right for a Mess of Pottage, and Establish Slavery by a Law: Which God in his great Mercy pre∣vent. Amen. FINIS.
