A New SONG. To the Tune of, A Beggar I will be, &c. PRay listen well, while I describe a Trimmer in the Church, Who Preaches oft, but for the Pray'rs he'l leave you in the lurch; For a Trimmer He will be, will be; for a Trimmer he will be. And here in the Pulpit, a Trimmer you will find With Trimming coldness in his Mouth, but Treason in his Mind; For a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer, to play the Rogue with a better Grace, Chose, out of the whole Land, to marry into Cromwell's Race; Thus a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer the Engagement took during Cromwell's Reign, But at the Restauration he spew'd it up again; Yet a Trimmer, &c. Thus this Trimmer, when uppermost, he chose the Rebels side; But when the King came in again, he strait swam with the Tide; For a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer so profits by his Prince's coming in, That from a Non-Conformist-Preacher, up he starts a Dean; Yet a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer, as soon as he Preferment gets, Immediately discovers he has not left his Cheats, But a Trimmer still, &c. What worse could this Trimmer do, his Function to disgrace, Than being got into the Church, the Altar to deface? Thus a Trimmer, &c. No sooner is a foolish Lord for a Traytor known, But he justifies his Loyalty, and confirms it by his own; For a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer instructs this Traytor how to die; But when he's question'd for't, he sticks not at a Lie; Tus a Trimmer, &c. This Trimmer has a Brother Scot, as great a Râ€”e as he, Supporter, and Speech-maker chief, to th' whole Conspiracy; For Trimmers they, &c. This Trimmer Scot to stay to swing was loth, But has left his Brother Trimmer here, I hope will hang for Both; For Trimmers They will be, will be; for Trimmers They will be. FINIS.
