Vid ad Vitam. BEING A short and sure VVay to a long Life. OR HELMONT JUSTIFIED; AND THE Excellency of Chymicall Medicaments Vindicated. By George Starkey, a Philosopher. LONDON, Printed, and are to be sold by Richard Hall at the Signe of the Golden Ball in Westminster-Hall. 1661.
To the Right Honourable ROBERT TICHBƲRNE, Lord Maior of the famous City of LONDON; George Starkey a Philosopher by the Fire, wisheth all temporal and eternal felicity. RIGHT HONOURABLE, IT may be wondred at by many, and censured by some, that I to your Lordship so very a stranger, should be so bold as to presume this De∣dication; and your Honour may perhaps account it as strange, if
not rash, that without pre-ac∣quainting your Lordship, I should so venturously undertake to do it. The wonder and censure of others I shall let pass, as not esteeming either the applause or censure of the vulgar, which is as uncertain and as changeable as the winde: But for your Lordships dissatis∣faction, which I only imagine may be caused by this Dedication, from him who is meerly a stran∣ger to your Honour; for remo∣ving of that, let me only crave your Lordships patience, and I doubt not, but to give such ra∣tional excuses of this presumpti∣on, as may reconcile your Ho∣nours (not offended, but perhaps somewhat amused) thoughts, to∣ward
your unknown, but cordial∣ly honouring servant. First therefore let me assure your Lordship, that it was not my own motion, that incited me to present your Honour with this Tractate, (although the worth thereof may deserve an honourable Patron) for I was sensible what boldness it might be esteemed, for me so unknown to your Honour, to dare to engage (as I may say) your Lordship in my quarrel, by calling on your Honour to patro∣nize a Polemical discourse; on which ground, and for which reason I intended to let it pass without any Dedication, till at length I was perswaded, by a good friend, one in command at present
in the Army, to do what here I undertake, be convinced by his so∣lid arguments of the conveniency of the same. Among which Arguments the most commanding was, when he upon his knowledge of your Lord∣ships inclination, having been long acquainted with your Honour, as∣sured me how great a lover of Ingenuity and Art he had ever known you, and by reason of your accomplished parts, how compe∣tent and able a Judge of the same: which was an unanswerable in∣ducement to me, to take the bold∣ness of presenting this to your Lordship, as to an able person to censure the same according to its worth and deserts.
Hereby (Right honourable Sir) I shall give a greater lustre to the truth for which I contend, when I submit and prostrate what I have done, to yours Honours judge∣ment for censure, and at your feet for patronage; confiding so to the truth of what I have written, as to assure my self, and promise your Honour such a foster childe, as will never shame its Patron; and doubt not, but so long as the Art of Medicine shall continue in esteem, which will alwaies be, so long as it is of use, this short dis∣course will live with credit, and where-ever it is preserved or kept, there it will make mention of your Honours worth and desert, and will prove a more clear and lasting
monument, then any statue of brass or Marble. For, My Lord, I am past doubt assured, that this small Treatise will be in esteem not in England only, but in other Na∣tions, as being drawn out of the fountain of most undoubted expe∣rience: in which though I am se∣vere in reproving common abuses, yet is it not without cause, as if your Lordships most weighty af∣fairs will permit you so much lei∣sure, as to look into the Epistle following, and the Book it self, you will see most evidently. 'Tis not (my Lord) all our Do∣ctors (but only such as are so qua∣lified, according to what I re∣prove) that I tax, and seek to re∣claim; for several among them
(to my knowledge) are Chymically given, as namely Doctor Ridge∣ly, Dr. Gurdane, Dr. Goddard of Oxford, Dr. French, Dr. Bathursts, Dr. Currar, and ma∣ny others, who have chosen the Chymical for the true way, and would wholly reject the other, were they but (Arcanorum A∣depti) Masters of those secrets which are taught and prepara∣ble by true Pyrotechny, after which they seek seriously and se∣dulously: only some thinking all Art with them already, defend their Method, against their know∣ledge and conscience. My Lord, who can be a fitter person for this Dedication then your self? whose office cals upon
you, and whose power enables you to minde these things here within your Honours Jurisdiction, whose vigilancy and care in your place hath been already eminent in re∣forming several abuses in this Ci∣ty, which by being so long un∣disturbed, could almost have clai∣med prescription, (were it not that what is unrighteous cannot claim prescription) but the subject of my ensuing discourse is a discovery not of an abuse of selling Beer, for which if a man give a halfpenny too much, he is only so much the poorer, and that is all, but it con∣cernes the precious life of thou∣sands, and their health, a thing so much beyond estate, that skin for skin, nay all the world (if a man
had it) oft times would he give for to save the same. This as it is of high concern∣ment to the sick, so ought it to be the principal care of the Magi∣strate to see that nothing be main∣tained under colour of Law, that may really prejudice, and indan∣ger the life and health of any. In vain are men secured from injury done to their goods, estate, credit, and liberty, while the most pre∣cious of all, their lives, are mono∣polized, and by colour of Patent, bought and sold. Our Doctors, (I mean the major part of them) maintain a method of medicine, which I impugn; the Controversie concernes the way of restoring dis∣eases safely, speedily, and certain∣ly,
in which your Honour, as a chief Magistrate, is nearly concerned; in vain are theeves and enemies provided against, if a Method be by authority confirmed and defen∣ded, which is of more dangerous consequence as to killing of many actually and immediately, of more by not restoring such diseases, which may easily be restored, were but the right way of Medicine allowed and incouraged. What their Method performes is obvious to, and the by-word of the veriest rusticks in the Nation, and the reason why more cannot be expected from that Method, is be∣cause it is erroneous and defective, dangerous and impotent, partly lame and ridiculous, partly la∣mentable
and desperate: To this Method as a remedy of its de∣fects, I have opposed the way of curing and restoring diseases by powerful Medicaments, which are adaequate remedies to the causes of the same, and have hazarded the cause in hand, and my re∣putation on the trial, if they dare to take me up: But I expect a more churlish answer (by club, or fist Arguments) that they will endevour to suppresse what they cannot overcome, against which violence I humbly entreat your Honours interposition, in lieu of whose protection, in what on∣ly is just, and Christian, I pro∣mise that if they will contend with me,
I will ingage on these grounds, That whatsoever they shall agree to give me for every Cure, I will forfeit twice as much for every one not cured in the time agreed on; that is, in all Feavers con∣tinual, Fluxes, and Pleuresies, in four daies; in Agues (not Hye∣mal quartanes) in four fits, in Hecticks and Chronical diseases in thirty (at most forty) daies, (now under continual Feavers I comprehend Calentures, small Pox, Measles, &c. which are of that head) provided they will be upon the same lay with me in as many Patients as I have for my share, which let them be divided by tens, they to divde one ten,
and I another, and alway the divider to have the five Pati∣ents which the chooser leaves; I will engage to perform all my cures without bloud-letting, pur∣ging by any promiscuous Purge, or vomiting by any promiscuous Vomit, that is, which will work on all indifferently sick or no, without Vesication, or Cautery, without making any issue, or curious rules of diet, without Clyster or Suppository; and let them perform their cures how they can, by choosing one or more (nomine omnium) to maintain the contest; and if I wave the combate on these terms, let me be suspended from ever
practising as a vain-glorious boa∣ster, and if they win of me, I will recant my opinion with the greatest both solemnity and ignomi∣ny they can devise to enjoyn me to. This as a tryal of Art or skill is the true Touchstone by which I shall stand or fall if they please, but I fear they will not en∣gage, some of them knowing that by my Medicaments (besides my own practise) one in Town here cures more annually, then any of their Colledge, the man a known man for honesty and Re∣ligion, and several others both in this City and the Countrey, whom I can call for testimonies of
the safety and efficacy of these e Pyrotechnical remedies, who  my directions cure many ely and certainly, seldome mis∣g the final cure, ever giving e, unlesse the ficklenesse of  Patient, or his extreme akness before administration nder the same; but I fear to  too troublesome to your Lord∣ip, whose serious affairs will se permit you leisure to per∣ a tedious Dedication: which ture consideration cals me off  time, and commands me to ke excuse for being already I fear) too long, only I be∣ch with your pardon your ac∣ptance of this small present, as
an acknowledgement of your Ho∣nours worth and virtue, and an expression of that esteem which he hath of your Lordship, who is, My Lord, Your Honours real though undeserving Servant, Geo. Starkey
To the studious lover of Truth and sedulous searcher after Na∣tures secrets, George Starkey (a Philosopher by the fire) wish∣eth all success and felicity. THis Apologetical Dis∣course studious and courteous Reader, must expect to meet with three sorts of men, and will finde vari∣ous entertainment from each sort of them. First, Some who are con∣cerned in this quarrel, and will think themselves much enga∣ged by it; such are those who
are by this short discourse re∣proved, and will be apt to com∣plain, that I am too invective and satyrical against them. To whom I answer, that the discourse is indeed polemi∣cal, but the first that entred the list were themselves, whom because they bid defiance to the truth here asserted, with heaps of reproches on such who were eminent in this Art (here defended) I was bold to meet, & to ingage conflict withal, and let them not complain, if they meet with shot for shot, and blow for blow. 'Tis true, a milde answer puts away wrath, but that is wisdome where the wrathful party and his anger
is to be regarded, but where equal terms are, there I know no reason, but a fool may be answered according to his folly. Paracelsus, Basilius, Valentine, Quercetan, Suchten, Phaedro, Hel∣mont, &c. were men for lear∣ning and worth as eminent as any the most eminent chief∣tains on the adverse side; and though of Artists I confess my self the meanest, and most un∣worthy to encounter, yet so far as concerns the controversie in hand, I will not give back an inch for the stoutest of the con∣trary party. Are they Physicians by pro∣fession? so am I, educated in the Schools as well as they,
graduated as well as they, nor was my time idly spent, but in the Tongues and course of Phi∣losophy usually taught, in Lo∣gick and other Arts read in the Schools, though I will not boast my self into comparison with any, yet if any be de∣sirous to assay what I am therein, I suppose I shall give such an account as not to ren∣der my self the repute of an idle mis-spender of my time and years. 'Tis not because I never read the usual Philosophy, that I do not embrace it, nor be∣cause I am a stranger to the usual Method of Medicine, that I speak and write against it, and
rather choose the true Chymi∣cal way then it. For the vulgar Logick and Philosophy, I was altogether educated in it, though never sa∣tisfied with it; at length Ari∣stotles Logick I exchanged for that of Ramus, and found my self as empty as before: and for Authors in Medicine, Fer∣nelius and Sennertus, were those I most chiefly applyed my self to, and Galen, Fuckslius, Avi∣cen, and others I read, and with diligence noted, what I could apprehend useful, and accoun∣ted this practical knowledge a great treasure, till practical ex∣perience taught me, that what I had learned was of no va∣lue,
and then was I to seek for a new path, in which I might walk with greater certainty, and by Gods blessing, by the tutorage of the fire, I attai∣ned true Medicines taught ob∣scurely by Paracelsus, but on∣ly explained by labour and diligence in the Art of Pyro∣techny. And that I am a little se∣vere in reproving abuses in the common way committed, I appeal to themselves, if what I write be not rather too milde then too invective, if so be that what I reprove be true, and that it is true all the world knows, and my Rea∣sons to prove my charge will
stand firm, till by some of their champions overthrown, which I doubt will never be. I would some of their side would dare to enter into the lists and maintain (if possi∣ble) their rotten building, their declaimed Method, to whom I shall give a short survey of his task. That all Diseases (in kinde) are curable; that I affirm, and they deny. That the vulgar Medica∣ments according as they are allowedly prepared, are not true Medicaments, for want of a right Philosophical prepa∣ration.
That he that is a Master of true Medicaments, may cure any Disease, safely, speedily, and certainly, without Vesications, Fontinels, Phlebotomy, Cathar∣ticks or Emeticks. That all Feavers continual may be cured in three daies, or four at most; and also Pleu∣resies; and he who cannot do that ordinarily, without bloud-letting or purging, is no Phy∣sician. That all Agues, yea though Quartans, may be cured in three Fits, four at most, un∣lesse that some Hectical ad∣dition be, and make the dis∣ease harder of cure, or the extreme debility of the Pa∣tient
make him not capa∣ble of so speedy recovery, and yet so in no long time may the Disease be resto∣red. That salivation in the Lues or Tubbing is a dotage, and that that Disease may be cured though old (in few weeks) without either. That Gonorrhoea's, though virulent, may be cured by killing the venome, by an∣tidotary remedies, in few daies, without any purgation, save by urine and a gentle sweat. That all Fluxes, though bloudy, may be cured in three or four daies, without any
Clyster, or Purge, or the like, by appeasing the inraged Ar∣cheus of the place, which is soon done, and the peccant occasional matter, will be a∣voided by urine, and ordina∣ry siege, as also by gentle sweat insensibly. That the true preparation of all Vegetals, takes away all the purging virulency, and the vomitive quality of them, except only in Opium, whose deleteriall quality is turned into a strong Dia∣phoretick, curing the Cough, and all Feavers, and Agues, except of the highest gradua∣tion, which require as power∣ful
Arcana's, as the Heredi∣tary Gout, or inveterate Epi∣lepsie. That Salt of Tartar volati∣zed, or made into a spiritual Elixir, with any essential oyle, is an absolute corrector of all vegetal poysons (none ex∣cepted) and is therefore a key to command the speci∣fick excellency that is in any concrete of the whole vegetable family. That this Elixir alone is a better remedy for any either acute or chronical disease, then any preparable according to the common dispensatories, and therefore that way which fur∣nisheth its sons with thousands
of other Medicines, must needs be the better way. That though Opium cor∣rected, after large sweat, the next day cause vomit (with some only) yet it is not to be reckoned among the com∣mon vomits, because first it works certainly by vomit with none: and secondly the same Medicine takes away the vo∣mitive quality in all other Medicines or Simples, as Ela∣terium, Hellebore black or white, Cambogia, &c. as al∣so the purgative venomes of Scammony, Zalap, Rhabarb &c. and having corrected them loseth its own vomitive quali∣ty together with them.
That by mean of this key specifick remedies may be had among the nobler vegetals (imprisoned (as they are) un∣der the custody of their viru∣lency) for all diseases in kinde, though not so speedy, and as universal, as by means of the great Arcana's, yet with care, diligence and industry, the cures may be as certain and safe, though (in the extremest dis∣eases) in a longer time perfor∣med. This is a short summary of my following Treatise, which I shall maintain and defend against the most stout adversa∣ry, that either by polemical writings, or by actual de∣monstration,
and he that will confute me, let him overthrow those Aphorisms by argument and by experiment, & Phillida solus habeto. 'Tis not unlikely but some captious Antagonist may cen∣sure my Aphorisms, as osten∣tatory, because many of them do lay down what I promise to be the effect of the Art by me commended, and many of them describe Medicines un∣known to their sect, and there∣fore such which they neither do nor willingly would be∣leeve to be in Nature, and therefore may think to put all off with a laugh, that I should challenge any adversary to fight
on ground which for ought they know is only imaginary, like the ground in the Moon, and against weapons, which for ought they will believe, are as meerly Romantick as the Knights Errant enchanted spears, swords or shields. To such a merry Antago∣nist, I might (as soon as he hath done his laughing) re∣ply in the known verse, fit for the purpose: er risum multum facile est cog∣noscere stultum. But I shall forbear any such aggravating proverbs, and come soberly to argue the case, and
to give an account of my so do∣ing, such as to a man rational may be satisfactory. Go too my friend, Is not the controverred question con∣cerning the true Art of curing diseases? you say your Art is the right, and the Art profes∣sed by Paracelsus, Helmont, &c. and commended by me, is wrong: I maintain the con∣trary sentence, which senten∣ces of ours being contradicto∣ry each to other, cannot pos∣sibly be both true; I to make it appear that I am not igno∣rant of your way and method oppose your Diaeticall pre∣scriptions as foppish, your Bloud-letting, Scarifications,
Vesications, Fontinels, either by cautery, or knife, to be cruel, needlesse dotages, so far are they from being the pre∣scriptions of true Art. I oppose your Medicaments as dangerous, provoking na∣ture by their venomous viru∣lency (as we use to say) ad restim, and forcing it to play one game for all, hoping that possibly (for it is no necessa∣ry consequence) in this com∣motion of the Archeus, by being put into such eminent danger, it may forget its for∣mer anger, through the pre∣sent fear, and in labouring to expell so dangerous an enemy,
may with it dislodge its former troublesome guest; this Art sometimes takes effect, and of∣ten it makes quick dispatch of both disease and life, and there∣fore is no more to be used ac∣cording to true Reasons di∣ctate, then a man or woman in an Ague or fit of the Gout is to be thrown into a river, because fear of drowning, or a sudden dangerous fright, hath been known oft to cure one, and ease the other. I have rejected your Cor∣dials, Coolers, &c. as ridicu∣lous, (barely palat-pleasing) toyes, and your diet-drinks, as non-sensical, fortuitous pre∣scripts,
your Locks, Tablets, Species, Conserves of Fox∣lungs, &c. as only mimical jugling feats, to multiply your Fees, and swell the Apotheca∣ries Bils. Had I done no more, I know you would have replyed like Oyster-women, and sung your Triumphs with contumelies and reproaches without allow∣ance; therefore to cut your Combs before you crow, I have propounded the true standard of being each of us judged by, and that is by our Work, the only true way of esteeming each workman. For when I have spoken
what I can in behalf of my way and Medicaments, and you declamed till your lungs be weary, in commendation of your Method, this at last will be the searching question to both of us, What is the end of my Art, and your Method? and whether of both doth most good? The end propounded to, and promised by both, is curing and restoring diseases; this if your Method can do better then my Medicines, it will be applauded notwithstanding my contempt of it, and if not, it will fall, notwithstanding your high commendation of the same.
In the comparison of way with way, and art with art, which is better, it may be true, that both may be good, but I have proved your Me∣thod to be erroneous, your Art untrue, and your Medicaments to be only nominally such, but really poysons; and yet if I had done no more, you would I doubt not have recriminated, (a poor way of answering a Charge) though without any proof. Now because I did expect from you recrimination, I have to anticipate your objection, rejected all Mercurial and An∣timonial Medicaments, either
Vomitive, Purgative, or Sali∣vative, as being sallets for your own Apparatus, Pigs of your own Sow, adopted sons of your own Method, as also all Ve∣getals, (so long as either Pur∣gative or Vomitive) and their Oyles, so long as Oyles, and their Salts, so long as fixt; we renounce from our myste∣rie, and leave them to you, finding them with you, [ut si∣miles labris lactucas]. But if any of you shall say, that you know not any such preparations as I mention, and therefore do not believe the commendations of them: then say I, why do you judge and
censure an Art you know not? why condemn you and re∣proach Artists, while you un∣derstand not what they pro∣fesse? for shame cease imitation of the Fox, and condemn not those Hens for lean, and Grapes as sowre, which are too high out of your reach. We knew your Art both Theorically and Practically, before ever we disliked it; learn at least this candor from your professed Antago∣nist. Therefore according to what we know, we come to your own doors, and dare you to combat, we defie your Cly∣sters
as ridiculous, your Pur∣ges, and Vomits, and Bloud-letting, as dangerous; your Is∣sues, Cauteries, Blistering, &c. as cruell and needlesse; and in a word, your whole Method we have impugned. Now because it may truly be replyed to what I have said, That if a cure be ne∣ver so desperate, or uncertain, or cruell, yet it is good (if it may do good) to be used, provided no better way can be had, since (not only a little bloud) but skin for skin a man would be content to give to save his life. Therefore (and very seaso∣nably)
did I lay down the ef∣ficacy of Medicines prepara∣ble by that Art which I com∣mend, and have instanced in those remedies which will per∣form my promise therein, which was an absolutely required task, for the making good of my as∣sertion. For if my Medicines would only do what your Method would perform, as speedily and as safely, yet it were the better, as being more simple, lesse chargeable, not tying the Pa∣tient to such curiosity in diet, nor by far so cruel, as using none of all your martyrdoms and butcheries.
But if my Medicaments will perform what your Method accounts impossible, and there∣fore dare not promise, nor give hopes of, as in the cure of the Palsie, Epilepsie, Gout, Agues, Kings-evill, &c. as also the Lues inveterate, with∣out Tubbing, or Salivation, in Gonorrhoea's of all sorts, without purgation or vomit∣ing, or detaining within doors, and will cure all acute dis∣eases, as Feavers, Fluxes, and Pleuresies, Calentures, Small∣pox, and Measles, at the ut∣most in four daies, without Blouding, or Purging, with∣out suffering the Small-pox to
fill, but by an Antidotary kil∣ling the venome, attenuating and avoiding the peccant mat∣ter by the pores, and morti∣fying the venomous corruptor of the bloud, not suffering the Archeus to make any purulent matter; and in all this performance, not tormen∣ting the Patient with forbid∣ding drink (a common cru∣elty in the vulgar Method) but allowing good Beer, and Wine moderately, in the most deplorable Feavers; if I say this be made good, certainly, ordinarily, and safely, then it must follow, that your Me∣thod is but a bloudy cruelty,
and a tyrannous cheat, no more to be pleaded for or defended, then Baal was to be pleaded for by Israel, who were the people of God. What I have said of the Medicaments commended by me, I will hazard the cause totally upon making it good, and can give past instances if required; but if any shall un∣dertake to combate with me, we shall not go to rake up things past, for to finde ex∣amples, but Hic Rhodus, hic saltus esto. If the Methodists dare to contend with me, if I do not stand contest, let me for ever be branded for a vain∣glorious
boaster, and till they do that, they must never expect victory. If their Method have done and can do what I promise by true Chymical remedies, known to me, and prepara∣ble by that Art professed by Paracelsus, Helmont, &c. let them take up the Cudgels and come forth; or if they will only try me, let them only give me as much for each party cured, as I will forfeit for each uncured of a thou∣sand in acute diseases in four daies, that is, in Feavers, Pleu∣resies, Small-pox, Measles, Fluxes, Calentures, and Agues
in four fits, not Hectical, or if Quartan and Hecticall, in four weeks, provided the strength be not wasted to de∣spair; and if I slink the proof of experiment, let me be re∣puted what they please, and if I cure not six for one, I will recant what ever I have written publickly; let them do the same if they dare. And as for the dangerous∣nesse of my Medicaments, which I know they will in∣sinuate; that is but a meer Bug-bear, by which ignorant people are frighted without cause, or ground, as the Je∣suites are reported to affright
their deluded Catholicks, by telling them that the Eng∣lish since the casting of the Popes Supremacy, are tur∣ned into Monsters, which those who know our Nation see to be but an invention, to keep their people under re∣straint, from falling into that Religion, which they call and account Heresie. I before advised the Rea∣der, that by the volatile Salt of Tartar all Vegetable poy∣sons are so corrected, as not to leave the least footsteps of the same, and that without decoction, but only by dige∣stion in a heat answerable to
the heat of the Sun, in which warmth, they in short space are turned into meer reall Salt, which will crystallize like Su∣gar-candy, tincted according to the concrete, and retaining so much of its taste and odour, as the [Magnum oportet, or vita media] will retain. So far then are these Me∣dicaments from being poyson, that my self will take of Hel∣lebore, or Elateum (two churlish poysons) or any other Vegetal, of the most malig∣nant quality, a dram at a dose, and that on a fasting stomach, and fast after it two, three, or four hours; and let any Ga∣lenist
do the like, and I will lay down the cudgels. But I have sung long e∣nough to deaf men, I shall have done with these capti∣ous Readers, and shall come to speak a word to those who are better tempered, af∣ter I have first given one word of admonition, to prevent a Cri∣tick. And that is, if that any faults chance to escape the Presse, my leisure not permitting me to attend it, they be attribu∣ted to their true cause; one (in perusing part of this Trea∣tise, as it was brought me by the Stationer before all
was perfected) I observed re∣markable, and that is a large Anachronism, which I cannot tell if or no, it were an error of the Printer, or a slip of my pen; this I am sure, it is a fault about of the bottome of the 16. page, where in stead of (though he viz. Aristotle, in many places severely carped at Galen, (read) be severely carped at by Galen) which was my meaning, not being ignorant of the number of years between Aristotle, Alexan∣ders Tutor, who was son to Philip, the first founder of the Grecian Monarchy, and Galen who lived since Christ, (of
whom, and Moses also he wrote blasphemously enough) in the flourishing of the Ro∣man Empire. Other faults I observed, and some may be which escaped by observation, where either a word or letter may be defective or redundant, which any candid Reader may correct with his pen, by the direction of the sense: and now I come to the second sort of Readers, to speak one word to them. And those are such who being indifferent on either side, are apt to incline to that part, which hath and brings the best reason, such perhaps may
at first sight blame me for too tart and Satyrical: to whom I shall answer with the Co∣moedian, In dicendo is operâ plerum{que} abutitur, non qui ar∣gumentum narrat, sed qui male∣voli Poetae maledictis respondet: I do but answer their re∣proaches oft and betterly cast on Paracelsus, and Helmont, and many other worthy Ar∣tists in the Chymical Myste∣ry, which if I wipe off, and shew the impartial Reader, that they are but spots in their own eyes, which causing their sight to dazle, they imagine to be on other mens garments, (which how substantially it is
proved, I appeal to the Rea∣der) then let no man wonder, if I tax their abuses very sharp∣ly, who were wont to make faults in others, and then re∣proach them as if they were reall. What I complain against in them, is no more then what several of their Apothecaries have seriously complained of to me, with protestations how they are tyred out with their Method, the effect of Medi∣cines being such, that an ho∣nest Apothecary dare scarce appear with his Bils, because he so oft told that such, and such, and other things did not
the least good, and yet they must provide and administer what the Doctor prescribes, though he be ashamed after to ask his money for it, and seldome receives it without grudging or imprecation. On which account several consci∣entious Apothecaries have been enforced through scruple of their trade, to renounce it, and live in the Countrey, on my knowledge; and several have lamented unto me the languidness of their method, and the burthen that lay on their spirits in the persecution of the same. That Satyrically I call them
sometimes Mr. Doctors, as Basilius Valentine (Domine Do∣ctor) is not because I am ig∣norant of the impropriety of the speech, but in imitation of the vulgar, and that not im∣pertinently, knowing the rule sentiendum cum Philosophis, lo∣quendum ut vulgus; and there∣fore whoever will be critical let him spare his Animad∣version there, since I have sa∣ved him the pains, and pre∣vented him. And lastly, I expect some Readers of the Hermetick fami∣ly; who wil esteem these lines, as true guides to noble Medicines, who I do not doubt will ear∣nestly
earnestly expect to hear some tidings concerning the true pre∣paration of the volatile Salt of Tartar, to operate on, and to prepare Metals and Mine∣rals; how by it Vegetals may be prepared hath been shewed, which give noble Medica∣ments for the restoring most diseases of all kinds, such to wit, which are not too high∣ly graduated, but where the case becomes too difficult for Medicaments of this rank, there let the Sulphurs of Mi∣neral bodies, such as Antimo∣ny, or Bismuth, be cohobated with an essential Oyle, till both be brought over the Helm: this
volatile Sulphur though foetid, turn by a due circulation in∣to an essential Salt, and then have you a remedy for most deplorable diseases, which may be further specificated with no∣ble Vegetals, as the Artist pleas∣eth, and the strong odor of it by rectification with spirit of Wine taken away. Yet the Spirit of Tartar thus volatized with Oyles, is the most languid of any, (there being several waies to perform the same thing) and each way giving more or less noble Spi∣rits) but one is most noble, and is inferior to none, but the Liquor Alchahest, by which
Mercury is so dissolved as to be brought into a sweet Oyle or Salt, and fragrant, on which though the dissolvent be co∣agulated, yet it is so noble a preparation of the same, as may be truly succedaneous to those of the highest liquor; thus al∣so may be made the anody∣nous Sulphur of Venus, and the glorified Sulphur of Anti∣mony, or of Regulus Martis, or of the Metallus primus, or of any Metalline body under Luna, and yet on the perfect bodies also, it acts by dissolution, and gets a virtue inferior to few Arca∣na's; of which operations I have treated in a peculiar Trea∣tise,
entituled, The Art of Pyro∣techny explained and confirmed, &c. to which I remit the Rea∣der, as intending ere long to publish it: In the mean time, enjoy these fruits of his labours, who is in all things to serve thee to his power, Thine as his own, Geo. Starkey. Nov. 20. 1656.
Natures Explication, & Helmont's Vindication.
The PREFACE OR INTRODUCTION. CHAP. I. WHen this question was put to a certain Philosopher, ? What is the est thing? It was his Answer, as is eported of him, , that is, Light: n answer in my opinion no lesse idicious then witty. Nor much un∣ike hereto, was that reply of him who being asked, wherefore he was
born? made this return, Ad viden∣dum Solem, to behold the Sun. For verily there is nothing comfortable, but by reason of its participation of Light, Darkness being on the con∣trary a principle of dread and hor∣ror. Now what visible light is unto bodily eyes, the same is the light of understanding and knowledge unto the eye of the minde. As then there is no state so so∣litary and deplorable, as to defect, then the want of light; so is there nothing more lamentable nor deser∣ving pity, then ignorance and blind∣ness of minde: And of all generati∣ons as those were anciently reputed the worst, which sprang out of the corruption of those things which were before the best; so when the light that is in a man once turns to be darknesse, how great is that dark∣nesse!
As therefore that light is to be ac∣counted the most desirable, and the want of it the most miserable, which concerns the soul or mind; so of all ig∣norance, that is the worst, which hath reference to the most noble object; & by how much the subject of know∣ledge is better and of more general use, by so much is the deprivement of that knowledge intolerable, and not to be rested in. Therefore as he who (not being able to intercept the ight) shall prevent mens injoyment thereof by putting out their eyes, is worthily accounted most wretchedly scruell; so he who shall with-hold, or obstruct, or pervert the means of knowledge, is no less, if not far more condemnable. And on the contrary hand, he who shall endeavour to clear those streams of that rubbish and trumpery which hath not only mightily stopt, but al∣so notably pudled the waters of this fountain; as he attempts a work of
more publick concernment, so if he actually perform any thing real here∣in, he will deserve no less of those who are herein concerned (which all ingenuous men are, or else ought to be) then Saul did of the Jabesh-Gi∣leadites, who delivered them from the insulting Tyrant, who would put out every mans right eye for a re∣proach unto Israel. Now next unto that knowledge which is indeed life eternal, namely to know God the only true God, and whom he hath sent Jesus Christ; which knowledge is of everlasting concernment: the most noble is that which discovers the Creators wil∣dom in the Creatures, so as to be able to distinguish their natures and pro∣perties, and to apply them to the use of Man, namely, to the resto∣ring of the defects of decaying Na∣ture, and the overcoming of Dis∣eases, which even unto lamentati∣on do waste and destroy almost in all
places the poor distressed members f Jesus Christ, under which many erish, being in extremity of de∣pair exposed to a sad spectacle, com∣rtless to the patient, and horrible to he beholders. These diseases and miseries, the uits of sin, inflicted most justly rom the righteous Judge, are yet cu∣able by remedies which the Almigh∣ty hath created, for which end the ather of mercies and God of com∣assion hath also created the Physi∣an, that he being an instrument of ercy, in the hand of a merciful Fa∣er, might make whole and binde p those whom the same God with s hand of justice hath wounded and oken. This in brief is the use of medici∣al knowledge, the subject whereof  in the first place, the Body and Nature of man, to know it both in s integrity and defects: and second∣ly, all Creatures without man, which
are to be considered, either more di∣rectly, as they tend to the affording of medicines, for remedying and pre∣venting defects; or Collaterally, a they serve to elucidate the nature ei∣ther of defects or remedies. This Art or knowledge of all Sub∣lunary attainments is the highest,  is the last, and bringeth up the Ree as I may say, unto all the rest;  that though the Geometrician, Arith∣metician, Politician, Mechanist, and the like, are not to be despised, ye they fall far short of that dignit which is due to the Physician, who object is the most worthy of Crea∣tures, even Man (who is made litt inferior to Angels, crowned with glo∣ry and honour) under whose feet  things have been subjected; yet  for sin is laid under vanity, of whi no small part are the distempers an maladies, which his frail life an weak body are subject to. This Art or Knowledge, as it ha
had continual, and shall have perpe∣tual use among men, so God hath been pleased to discover it in some degree and measure in all Ages, that in no generation there should be wanting a testimony as of his Justice, so of his infinite and transcendent Mercy, who is ready as with one hand to chastise and afflict, so with the other to succour and relieve those who are chastised and corrected. Those who have been endowed with this skill or science, God en∣dowed also with a Heart communi∣cative; so that they have out of compassion unto those who are in misery, been free in the discovering unto posterity what they understood herein, so far to wit, as might con∣duce to the stirring up of the ingenu∣ous to a personal further inquiry, and also be a help to them in their search to discover those secrets, which they who were before them found bene∣ficial to the healing of this or that di∣stemper.
Among whom Hippocrates, one of the first and most eminent, who left any thing to us upon record of use∣full experimental practice: whose at∣tainments, as they were in reference to the rudeness of his Age, admirable; so his Candor in discovering the same was commendable: saving that what he left sincere, hath (through the abuse of times) been much corrupted with the placits and invention of such, who not comparable to him in reality, would yet seem to excell him in appaency. The excellent ver∣tue of this man as it was alwaies ma∣ligned by Satan (to whose malicious disposition it is natural to envie those things most especially, which are o may be of the greatest concernment for the good of Man, either his spi∣ritual or temporal life) So through his policy it was soon forgotten by posterity, and his renowned skill, for which he was not without cause na∣med Divine Hippocrates, after his
death was so buried with him, that in a short time there was nothing but the bare name thereof retained by his successors. And as nothing strikes a more fa∣tall blow to vertue and verity, then a glorious shew thereof without any re∣ality; so by this policy Satan, that he might, if possible, for ever keep in oblivion this so necessary a science for the use of man, At length about five Ages or more from the death of Hippocrates, Galen comes in upon the Grecian stage, who as if it were his design to rake up the glowing Em∣bers of Hippocrates Art from under the ashes of forgetfulness, wrote ample Tomes concerning this Art of medicine; and that the memory thereof might be kept from future perishing, digested the same into a Method, whereby this Art might af∣terwards be communicated by ver∣ball Tradition in Scholastick Le∣ctures and disputations.
Now had Satan brought his de∣sign unto a full head, which being once on foot, he ceaseth not to pro∣secute with all possible craft and di∣ligence. For as his chief aim is to se∣ver the shew from the substance, knowing that way to be of all other the most effectual for the fatal sup∣pressing and smothering truth: so this empty shadow was soon had in high esteem, insomuch that being cryed up in the Schools it soon got footing all the world over, insomuch that there was no civilized nation or people, how different soever in Laws, manners and customes, but with one accord they all submitted to march under Galen his banner, and counted it the glory of their studies, and the crown of their labours to receive his Badge. And to make this the more plau∣sible, the Schools invented their ho∣norary Titles, the more to allure Stu∣dents to this their profession, bestow∣ing
upon as many as had sucked out by their studies and disputations Ga∣lens Marrow, and learned his Me∣thod, so as to be able to read a Le∣cture, or make a Commentary upon him, the title of Doctors: insomuch that they drew multitudes after them; all, partly through ambition, and partly through pride and sloth, wil∣lingly yeelding themselves to be se∣duced by the common Error. By this means the pure fountains of true learning were miserably pud∣led and poysoned, insomuch that as many as drank of them being lulled into a deep sleep, finding honour and riches in that seeming knowledge which they had drank in, were abun∣dantly contented. Yea and to make their station the surer, they decreed, that upon penal∣ty of loss of their gradual titles of honour, no man should dare to step a step out of the rode-way of Galen, whose Volumes being by Scholastick
Authority confirmed for Text, they left it to the judgement of acute wits to build what they could or would upon this foundation. In the mean time Hippocrates, what of his wri∣tings were extant, are made use of in subordination to Galen, who among his many tedious prattles commented upon Hippocrates, drawing him in what he could to his own placits, and where he could not he corrupted him. Yea and the Arabian writers, both ancient and modern throughout all their books, do all with one neck seem to draw in the yoke of Galen. At length this noble science being degenerated into idle speculation, on which was built an edifice looking only to gain and popular applause, first being divided from the Truth, was afterwards rent into three divi∣sions, of which each occupied a seve∣rall station. First there was the Phi∣losopher or contemplative Physician.
Next the Physician or practical Phi∣losopher. And lastly, the Chirur∣gion or Doctors Man, who was to minde things of an inferior rank, as namely, dressing of Wounds, setting of Bones, the cure or care of Ulcers, and the like; while the Doctor who for reverence and profundity of skil deserved a better office, employed himself in the contemplation of Dis∣eases and inward Griefs: who in the mean time promiseth not to be want∣ing to the Chirurgion in case of any Feaverish distempers, which outward miseries and griefs do often cause. Thus at length finding this Trade to have many Clients, through the degeneration of times, the care of medicines and their preparation is judged too sordid a work for Ma∣ster Doctor; and the Chirurgion his man, taking state upon him by little and little, waves this work as too mean, or at the least unnecessary for him also: so between them the
Apothecary is set up as the com∣mon Shambles, to which both may resort for medicines. The Apothecary (whose work is to be a servant both to the Master Doctor of Physick, and his Man Do∣ctor of Chirurgery, (who of a Bar∣ber and wound-dresser which was judged too mean an employment for the Doctor) is by degrees now stept up even to his Masters title. The Apothecary I say, who is to serve both these in preparing and con∣founding Simples according to their direction by their bils, perceiving his custome to increase, soon waves the one half of his work, namely, the providing of Simples; which gave being to another sort of Retainers to this pompous magnificent Art, and those are the Druggists. Thus this blessed Science, which in its primitive verity and uncorrupted sincerity, was in great mercy given by a compassionate Father for the re∣storing
of poor Mortals, whom he in his Justice had smitten, and which ought sincerely to be exercised with the same spirit, and for the same end, by which and to which it was given, is contrariwise at length become the Engine of oppression, cruelty, and butchery, the prop of pride, and am∣bition, covetousness and idleness. The Philosopher or contemplative Naturalist, who, as was before touch∣ed, was made a Member of this Sci∣ence, as he soon grew distinct both from the Doctor, and his Man the Chirurgion, yea and from his Mans an the Apothecary, whose work was (as in a hopsack) to catch Na∣ture, in some one syllogism or other of the three Figures; so also did he oon outstrip both the one and the ther in Academical esteem, inso∣much that his employment being ublimed a degree higher then Art,  ranked among the Liberal Sci∣nces.
For the Schools being indeed the bed of sloth and idleness (yet ador∣ned with many glorious and painted hangings) have this perpetual Ma∣xime, to esteem those things most highly which are farthest removed from reality, so that soaring into spe∣culations, their station is evermore there, where imagination only hath its being: Medicine therefore being made too gross for them by reason of the necessary dependency it hath on practise, they suckt our the uni∣versalities of it with the universalities of all other natural practical Arts, as Geometry, Astronomy, Uranoman∣cy, Geography, Arithmetick and the like, which they moulded up into one aery lump of Natural Philisophy. The standard-bearer of this Rab∣ble was Aristotle, who though he in many places severely carped at Ga∣len, yet forasmuch as they agreed in the main, namely in point of much apparency with little or no truth,
they were both accepted and succes∣sively read, Aristotle as the Father of Philosophy, and Galen of Medi∣cine. Thus this mystery of iniquity had its full life and motion, being guar∣ded and graced with a many fol∣lowers, who though in some things they seem to differ, yet are they but like to Samsons Foxes looking several waies with their heads, are yet tyed fast by the tails. This pomp of Physick and Philo∣sophy, it is a wonder how far and how fast it spread; for according to the Proverb, They must needs run whom the Devil drives: it in short space overspread all the known world, so much of it as was in any measure so civilized, as to imploy themselves in learning. Yea and though naturally mens ambition be very great, and the glory of being an inventer of any new ingenuity be much thirsted after in the world,
yet was this not able to prevail with any of the succeeding ages, but all with one accord were willing to sub∣scribe, and gloried therein as in a notable deserving Trophey. By how much then any one ex∣celled in wit or parts, he was the more ingaged in the maintaining this post with Arguments and So∣phisms, also in Epitomizing, illu∣strating, digesting and confirming Galens Text, which was accounted the height of Scholastick attain∣ments. Thus posterity being drawn along as with two Coach-horses, with the authority of Galen and Aristotle, ad∣miration of these was a badge of their Academical loyalty; and who∣soever should dare to swarve from these, was branded with a note of In∣famy; and so being looked upon as Heterodox, was the object of scorn and derision, and what was most grie∣vous of all, was hereby ipso facto,
incapable of degrees of honour and preferment, and so consequently out of the rode-way of serving covet∣ousness, by squeezing money out of the purses of the afflicted, who would willingly give not only their goods, but even skin for skin for the saving of their lives. For from the time that this science degenerated unto the formality of a Profession, the Schools have alwaies used all diligence to engage the ri∣pest wits fastest unto them; and for the attaining this end, they have wanted no manner of inviting allure∣ments, as namely honour, respect, worldly esteem, and gain. He then who inclines to ingenuity, soon after he hath some insight in the Tongues by education at the Gram∣mar School, he is thence transmitted to the Academy to be further culti∣vated. Where he learns Logically to dispute according to the Rules of Aristotle; and withall, exerciseth his
Oratorial faculty by declamations in turnes; after that he proceedeth to read Physiology according to Aristo∣tles Doctrine, which is disputed in publick pro and con with a great deal of dexterity. Ethicks are added to these studies at spare times, with the principles of Metaphysicks and the Mathematicks in general, and some things are performed in Hebrew and Greek Studies. Thus at the end of four years upon performing of pub∣lick declamations, disputations, and the like, the initiatory title of Bat∣chelor of Arts is bestowed as a crown of their industry; from which time till the end of three years, they are to be employed in epitomizing the se∣ven Liberal Sciences, and reducing them into Systemes and Synopses, and then with a great deal of honour they are declared Masters of the said Sciences, and have liberty granted them to apply themselves to the practise of any one or other of
them, when ever called unto it. And now the youth stands as a staffe set up, waiting which way it will fall: for this testimony concer∣ning them hath declared them to all the world to be fit to profess any thing. And (not to speak of the abuse of Divinity-profession, which is per∣mitted upon these termes) if the ge∣nius of this Arts master (who hath drunk himself drunk of liberal Sci∣ences) stand toward the profession of Physick, (which he may begin to think of when he is Batchelor in Arts) then are there publick professed Le∣cturers, whom he may almost daily hear declaming on that subject; wch Lectures if he then attend diligently, and shall peruse Anatomists, and read Galen over (at least cursorily) and collect notes out of him and A∣vicen: if he turn over the Herbals, and learn to know some plants by name and sight, and in the mean
time in the publick Halls shall di∣spue concerning the use of parts, the generation of man, the Elemen∣tall quality of some things, as name∣ly, Camphire, Quicksilver and the like, (which two simples have, after the discharging of some hundreds, not to say thousands of Ergoes, first and last, out of the Canons of Aristotle and Galen, more notably puzled the Antagonists, (who to th day know not on what side to deter∣mine) then ever the Devil was puzled to finde the meaning of Aristotles Entelechia) after I say these notable performances, he shall be licensed a Practitioner, and dub'd a Doctor, provided he will make a great Feast, and give store of Gloves. By which costly attainment they make su of these three essential things: first, that none shall be a Doctor who hath not so much money to throw away, and they as have, may be concluded to be fine-fingred chubs, who will
be more scrupulous of fouling their hands with coals, then careful to keep a good conscience. Secondly, that they will not readily despise that honour as trivial, which cost them so dear, which therefore they will readily defend what they can. And thirdly, that upon this score they shall have fat fees, upon which their minds are more set, then how to perform faithfully what they un∣dertake, for gain is the first and last of their intents. And therefore when a Physician is to be dub'd a Doctor and admitted a Brother, the elder Brethren to help him in his practice and skill, give him but one general Receipt, which is the only one which they have worth communication, and that is, Accipe Donum, Take your Fees. And as though Counsel in this were not enough, they binde them to it; and lest they should be out in their Receipt, they assign the most convenient time for getting
the Ingredients, and that is, Accipe dum dolet, that is, Make sure of your money while the grief is greatest. This is part of the Mystery, but not all: For to be sure both from without & from within, they have so far prevailed, as to monopolize the lives of men, (by which means they know they can command their mo∣neys) that so they might maintain themselves, their Barbers, Apotheca∣ries, and Druggists after a Lord-like way. Which Patents of Monopoly, I I conceive might hence have their Original: It may be some of these Master Doctors have in lieu of vast Fees condescended to be very offici∣ous about Kings, Lords, or great persons, in the time of sickness of a Wise, Husband, Brother, Son, Fa∣ther, or some near acquaintance or dear friend, to co work with the pro∣vidence of God in the quick dispatch of them in their misery by their re∣medies,
who perhaps otherwise might have lingred long, and languished in extremity, or else through the strength of Nature, with difficulty recovered that disease, to have possi∣bly fallen into as bad or worse some years after, both which by their me∣dicines they for security sake pre∣vented. It may be also sometimes some such great persons by the good hand of God escape both the discase & their Doctors (yea sometimes when many of them together have consulted by their Medicines to make them fat pa∣sture for the worms) and yet not∣withstanding all, God hath restored them from both dangers (of which that of the Doctor is the most for∣midable, for he either adds load to, or else takes away strength from foyled nature) and then the Physician cries out with the Man, who when his fol∣lowing friend was struck in the face with a Bow (that he held walking
among trees) and complained of the blow, What a blow would it have struck, quoth he, if I had not held it? So he, when he sees his mi∣serably enfeebled Patient after the disease is gone, What would you have been, had not I let you bloud and purged you, and made you bar∣ly water and cooling Julips, and gi∣ven you Glysters and Cordials to comfort and nourish you? but as the Bow would but have brusht, had not the other held it and bent it, which being held, gave a foul stroke; so the Disease would have come off with less debilitation of the Patient, had the Physitian been further off. Thus as well by the not succeeding of their remedies, when the Patient recovers, whom their nature is to de∣stroy; and the success of the same when by them a quick riddance is made, credit is gained besides large gratifications: by this means they get favour with Princes, of which
one notable improvement hath been, that they alone in the world have the priviledge to murther innocent per∣sons, provided they do it according to a methodical way of Art. Two main grounds of this Mono∣poly are, first, the preservation of their gain and credit, which other∣wise would much be impired, were not this provident course taken; for even old Wives and Farriers, Moun∣tebanks and the like, do with some simple or other, undertake and cure their deserted Patients, to their de∣served confusion. But secondly, her by they shut the gate to all further search in Nature, for as for any among themselves they are sure: for who knowes not the mighty force of education, which being once suckt in (à teneris annis, as we use to speak) is so lodged that it is with much difficulty eradicated; yea, and although an opinion to an uningaged person seem never so ab∣surd,
yet to one whom education hath ingaged, it appears not so, yea acute∣ness makes little to the discovering the weakness of such an opinion, but rather supplies curious and specious arguments to maintain it, and to op∣pose any contrary. Besides in this mystery there is not only a prepossessing of the phantasie and understanding, but also a pre∣occupation of the will, namely with things by which the will is intangled, as honorary titles of Master Doctor, your Worship, and the like, which together with Angels and Pieces can as powerfully hush a muttering con∣science, and salve a scrupulous breast, when it is stumbled with the frustra∣neous event of the ridiculous method of medicine, as the same medicine can loose a Lawyers tongue and make it run glib, which would else scarse wag in his Clients cause. Moreover, Truth is not to be catcht with gaping, but with pains
infatigable, and serious meditation, which they who are ingaged in many lucriferous visits, cannot attend, they may only read of better things, and say, I would I could see them, but they not coming with a wish, they sigh and say (Audio at vix Credo) and as for their own unsuccessefulness they thus excuse, I proceed accor∣ding to Art, but the blessing is in Gods hand; the party was too weak to bear the Cure, or was too old, or I was call'd too late, or care was not used in following directions, or the disease was epidemically malignant, or incurable, or some such thing or other is pretended, and so the earth covers their defects. And because they kil not all they meddle with, God by his mercy preventing their endea∣vours to some, therefore they are not discouraged with the multitudes they either kill or suffer to die miserably under their faithless medicines, while they by their monopolizing Patent
prevent, lest any with better medi∣cines should shame them. Thus I say they have the Trade wholly in their own hands, a Trade by which they never did nor can cure any, but kill many; but whatever they have that may do good, they have it from the accidental experi∣ments of old wives, and good folks, who have found or known much good done by this or that Herb or Simple, which did more good by far when it was simply used by silly women, then when the Doctors af∣ter had drawn it into Receipts, ca∣strating their virtue by confounding with many others in decoction, or otherwise according to their Idio∣tism. Whatever then they administer or advise, that doth good, it doth it not upon account of any method or art of theirs, but would work the same effect if applyed by the hand of a Ru∣stick, as prescribed by them.
Yea and often their method of compounding, decocting, and admi∣nistring both in respect to the Dose and time, do notably hinder, if not destroy the working and prevent the good of the applyed remedy, though the Doctor little minde that, when once his Fee is in his pocket. Even the most serious of them will confess, that all their Art consists in experimental Receipts, which as not being minded by them, I mean the collecting Simples in their time, the keeping of them, and ordering in administration, exposeth oft a Do∣ctor to scorn, which same Simples formerly had commended some well∣meaning woman in curing a deserted Patient, to the Doctors disgrace. Whose Art, I mean of feeling pulses, tossing urines, and prophesy∣ing out of them, stirring of close∣stools, letting of bloud, (at least com∣manding it to be done) preaching on the disease, ordering of diet, prescri∣bing
purgations and the like, is but a meer imposture, a cheat of the world, a butchering of the sick (which is even a proverb among the vulgar, yet the Doctor minding his fees too much, will not perceive, at least will wink at, being content to bear any thing so he may get money) for which a dreadfull account will at last be exacted by the just Judge, of them, who pretending to take the care of the sick, devour families, and then expect a reward for destroying them. But this only being intended for an Introduction, and my propoun∣ded scope to discover nature, and withall to vindicate noble Helmont from unjust reproaches, I shall leave a while the Doctors to their Clients, and come to give a brief of this un∣dertaking. First of all let me ingenuously pro∣fesse, that I have no personal quarrel with any, nor do I upon any such account write prejudicately.
Secondly, That I purpose not to disparage any thing that is good in them, to make what is bad on my side to appear good, or what is but indifferent to seem excellent, but shall deal as candidly with them as may be. Thirdly, That what I write shall not be out of a principle of (Jurandi in verba Magistri) but what I write shall be for explicution and for de∣fence, not for repetition sake. Now concerning my self it will be requisite that I should speak a lit∣tle, not out of any content that I take therein, but to give the Reader some small satisfaction, in what he may, at least as I conceive, be preju∣diced. For mine own part, I know the re∣ward of this my labour will be Ca∣lumny, yet I will be sure to reproach none, and though I merrily (and yet not without aversion of spirit) carp at some things, yet before the close of
this Treatise, I shall give Reasons, I hope, satisfactory for this practise: for — Ridentem dicere verum, Quis vetat.— If any be troubled at my sporting jests now and then cast, I must needs say there is in my Jests nothing scur∣rilous, immodest, or uncivil, nor any thing bad in them, except it be that they are true, I wish heartily they were not. CHAP. II. AS touching the Art of Pyro∣techny and Chymistry, I must seriously profess, that of all Arts in the world it is to me most pleasing, because its principles to an ingenious man are demonstrable by the fire. It was not conceit, nor novelty, nor
hope of gain, that allured me, but on∣ly love and desire of truth. For I found demonstrably that the founda∣tions of common Philosophy were totally rotten. The first suspicion of them was oc∣casioned by a dispute of the possibili∣ty of making Gold potable, which being by the Antagonist held nega∣tively, I, what out of Authors and what by study, did so evince the possibility of it, that my arguments were by him unanswerable, and to my self satisfactory. The speculation I confess pleased me well, who above all things in the world prized health, and as my mind was naturally propense to action, I desired much to make it; and com∣forting my self with the common Maxim, Dimidium facti qui bene coe∣pit habet, He who hath well begun hath half done: And remembring that in Theory there were but two parts, namely, An sit, & quomodo sit,
That a thing may be done, and how. Also that the first could not be irre∣fragably proved without some know∣ledge at least in the latter, I collected (upon this confidence) out of Phy∣sick and Logical Authors, what Ar∣guments I could touching the  of this subject, whereof I conceived that I fully understood the . For alas I thought that the Logical heads of invention, especially according to Ramus, would not fail to unfold to me this whole mysterie. Hereupon concluding what I had proved that the thing was fecible, I wrote a Congest of methodical Arguments which might unfold how; and here I found my self in a wilde labyrinth, for I was soon by these studies brought to see the rottennesse both of Logick and Philosophy, and found that he who sought truth of things there, might soon lose himself. This put me upon desire of a more secure path, for now I apprehended
(before years and titles had engaged me) that besides what I knew in Tongues, my skill in Logick and Phi∣losophy was not worth contemning, yea nothing was in mine eyes more vile. I therefore rejected Aristotle and all his fictions, against whose fallaci∣ous shew I wrote with a pen dipt in salt and vinegar, yet without gall, a Treatise called Organum novum Philosophiae: but before I could pitch on what way to turn, (for knowledge I desired too too immoderately) I wandred through many pensive hours, and waking nights, till at length I got som Chymical Authors. Those then I perused and noted with much diligence, not so much out of desire to rifle their Hesperion Garden, as to suck out of their prin∣ciples some solid truth; for truth I knew was uniform. Wherefore as many experiments as I could try I tryed, and took nothing upon any
mans trust, so as to build any thing on it, or to draw any conclusion from it: I invented many sorts of Fur∣naces, procured what Glasses were possible, with all manner of Simples, Mineral and Metalline especially (which I most esteemed) in these I spent my time for several years, and I may say without boasting, that if ever any in the world were an in∣fatigable prosecutor of experiments, I was one. In the mean time the Lord was plea∣sed so far to be propitious unto my labours, studies, and many watchings, that he let me see so much of truth, as to make it lovely to me; for which cause (next to the glory of God) I shall prosecute the same du∣ring my life. Nor was this an imaginary con∣tent only, but real, for there is so great variety of objects in Nature which are exceedingly delightful to be understood, that the discovery of
any of them (which is usually the crown of serious searches) is more content, then finding of sought trea∣sure can be to him who in hopes of it digs the earth. And although the wise man by an unerring Spirit hath laid all these things under vanity, so that in much knowledge there is much vexation of spirit, yet withall, the Scripture teacheth us that the works of God are wonderful, sought out by all that have delight in them; yea and if a mans heart be not ex∣ceedingly out of frame, a man con∣not behold the excellencies of the Creature without a contemplation of the super-transcendent glory, power, and wisdom of the Creator, of which all things visible are but Emblems. Yet do I not deny but that the spirit may be carried forth with too much eagerness after things of this nature, which I have often suspected to be mine own fault, but this is the fault of us, that so immo∣derately
affect the outside, as to neg∣lect the inward glory; and so much admire the apparent glory of things visible, as not enough to adore him who dwelleth in light inaccessible, of whose beauty these are but a sha∣dow, and of whose fire but sparks. There is then an unspeakable be∣nefit may arise to a painful enquirer after the mysteries of Nature, in re∣ference to the spiritualizing of the affections, since as Cicero said of Vir∣tue, that if it were to be seen with eyes corporal it would enamour the beholders, it may most properly be applyed to this case. For who is he who when he beholds Gods wonder∣ful wisdom, power, goodness, &c. which all are most obvious in the study of Nature, which is one of the Books in which the Almighty is dis∣covered, that will not cry out with Job, I have heard of thee by the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee: and with David, O Lord how wonderful are
thy works! the fool conceiveth them ot, nor the unwise understandeth hem, &c. But considering, that God hath endowed us with a Body,  which our Soul, which is the Di∣ine Image, is caged as it were, by neans of which we have our place ere among natural things. And orasmuch as our life is laid un∣er vanity, of which our diseases o which our body is subject, which re to us the Heralds of death, is no mall part. Also since man being by the Crea∣ors ordaining made Lord of the other Creatures, and these are made o serve him; insomuch that there is carce a concrete which hath not its mmediate use applicable to man, either for his necessity or conveni∣ency. And therefore all things are given into his hand, that of them he may take for meat and drink what nature craveth, for raiment what ne∣cessity and modesty and decency
call for, and likewise for the repai∣ring the defects of decayed nature what is needfull therein: God like a tender Father having provided for man in every respect, and on every occasion. I think it a great sottish∣ness in them who cannot see both the nobleness and usefulness that the con∣templation of Gods works carrieth with it, insomuch that he who shall neglect it, doth neglect in mine opi∣nion a great part of the task for which he came into the world, and is not to be pityed if he fall short of the comfort, content or benefit that he might reap in the knowledge of the same. Now that all creatures have in them a spiritual Celestial virtue, I suppose there is none moderately versed in Philosophy that will deny, and we shall in its place sufficiently discover, which in concrete Bodies is more hidden, most of all in such which are of the most exquisite com∣position.
This Celestial Spirit is that which is the life, excellency, and perfection of all things in which it is, and though it have received in all speci∣ficated subjects a determination, or bounding of its virtue, yet the Spi∣rit it self is free to operate upon other subjects, and its operations are received per modum recipientis. Now here is the grand fault or de∣fect of those whose office it is more peculiarly to enquire into these things, that they supinely neglect the search of the hidden spirit, which is in all things by so much the more straightly sealed, by how much it is in virtue more noble and excellent. Contenting themselves with an overly view of the outside of things, although yet they have the care of lives committed to their charge, which fault as it is of high concern∣ment, so it requires a most sharp re∣proof. For there are in Nature most no∣ble
and powerful medicines, made by God for the use and relief of the afflicted, which yet are neglected by such, who undertake the care and cure of them, and all because they are not without pains and industry attainable: But go too my good friends, hath not God laid this bur∣den upon mankinde, that in the sweat of his brow he should eat his bread? must he toyle for his daily meat, and do you thing that medi∣cines do grow ready made to his hand? Or if the ground do of its own ac∣cord bring forth some fruits, as Ap∣ples, Cherries, or the like, see you not how ready they are to grow wilde if not cultivated? Nay, is not this vanity laid upon the Universe, and doth not the earth grone under this curse, that thornes and thistles it shall bring forth, and all to help for∣ward this sentence which was pro∣nounced against man, that in labour
he should eat his bread, and what is Analogical to bread, with industry he should provide Medicaments; the one for sustaining, the other for the restoring of nature. Ile grant that there are many ex∣cellent things which are to be found among Simples, but first of all their virtue is more precisely singular, one being properly directed for one or two diseases, and the number of Simples being so infinite, and so ma∣ny of them of little virtue, so many of none medicinal, but being destined for meat for man or beast; so many being so virulently destructive to na∣ture, that it is no way safe in their crude simplicity to use them, all of them being restrained to some parti∣cular distempers, and manner of ope∣rations, a mans life would not serve him to be half a Physician, in the use of Simples, without preparation or correction. When it appears that the Art of Pyrotechny is indeed
most useful, necessary, and delight∣ful, which God willing in the ensu∣ing discourse I shall fully discover. And to close this Preface, I af∣firm and promise to make good, that by the Art of Pyrotechny, me∣dicines are to be made and prepa∣red; of which one is of as much ef∣ficacy, as all the herbs, roots, trees and Animals in the world, all put to∣gether, used in their naked simpli∣city. Which Art most commendable in it self, useful to mankinde, and de∣lightful to the Artist, hath been op∣posed, slandered, reproached, revi∣led and gainsaid by the verbous rai∣ling Galenists. Who yet professing themselves the only heirs of Medicinal Art, do promise that to the world by their method, which for these many cen∣turies of years they have found suc∣cesseless; and this notwithstanding they do continue to maintain that
by virtue of monopoly, which all he world discovers to be but a meer uggle. What disdain and contumely have hey not cast upon Paracelsus and Helmont, by traducing them and peaking all manner of evil concer∣ing them? and this only is the quar∣el, that these come to discover to he World the unsufficiency of vul∣gar medicines. This true light of Nature these Night-birds cannot bear, the true eir these usurpers will not endure, ut no sooner espie they him, but hey conclude, This is the heir, come et us kill him, and then the inheri∣ance shall be ours. Therefore let not any marvel, if I now a little severely carp at Errors, or this is the only way that is now eft, all other means have been tryed, they by many have been most friend∣y called upon to awake out of the dead sleep in which they are; but it
were as good to call upon posts  stones, for they only rub their eye and reproach such who disturb them but sleep again as soundly as eve it is good then to scourge and pri them, whom jogging will not  good upon. And because they have had  long time that knavish principle  calling whore first, it is not a sometimes to answer a fool acco∣ding to his folly, lest he be wise  his own conceit. Who knowes not how commo it is for that Tribe to inveigh again Chymical Medicines most bitterly sometimes accusing their virulency sometimes their acuteness in oper∣tion; and for proof they will bri all the Mountebanks, Empiricks, a rash Psudo-chemists on the stag forgetting in the mean time that th do as much differ from what the would make them to be, as the selves do from true Philosophe
that is as much as light doth from darkness. Nay, rather the forementioned Rabble, as also the scum of Brothels, old Wives, Quacks, and the like, do but usher in their own train: for who knows not, that one Apothecary or Mechanical Chymist doth supply both the one and the other? Let us not contend about words, but come to the thing it self, and we shall by it see to which house these villanies are retainers; & when I have traced them to their own doors, I shall express more candor then ever the Galenists in urging this Controversie were guilty of: for although they make it their common practise to lay this spurious off-spring at the true Chy∣mists doors, and then to revile them as guilty of all their miscarriages, yet we shall first prove this bastard∣ly off-spring to be a Galenical Brat, of which the Father is (though with∣out cause) ashamed, unless it be that
they oft at random hit the distemper, which the reverend Doctor by his bleer-ey'd, purblinde method could not do, and cure the same, though with a desperate medicine which the other despaired of; and after the true father of this infamous genera∣tion is found, we shall not impute the blame of the children unto the fathers, but suffer every one to bear his own blame: which moderation of ours, I hope will for shame-sake teach the Galenists for the future to endevour the like, in imitation of our candidness. And first I beseech the impartial Reader to consider how, and where∣in the followers of Paracelsus and Helmont, and their like differ from the followers of Galen and those who subscribe to him: is not this the main difference, nay the only, that one is the immediate follower of Na∣ture, and of his Author, so far only as he doth bear faithful witness to
her operations: the other is the im∣mediate follower of him whom he makes the Captain of his Notions, to whose placits if Nature will not comply, he will either force her or adieu. Is not this evident in all our Aca∣demical Doctors, and hath been so for several successive Ages? Is not subscription the top stone of the Galenical Art? Is not Galens method to this day retained and defended, ac∣cording to which all created Doctors are ingaged to go; and what I pray is this Method? but by Rules set down to finde out the disease Diagnostically, to discover the dan∣ger of it Prognostically, and to ad∣vise the cure of it according to the precepts of Art, that is, according to the judgement of some approved Author, in which the Doctor readeth when to apply the cardinal remedies of bleeding, scarifying, vesicating, cauterizing, purging, or the like, and
when to make use of Cordials either cooling or others. Now the practick part is that in which the Doctor is for the most part but an errand bungler, yet he hath at command his Chirurgion and Apothecary that can indeed effect what he by his Goosequill shall ap∣point. Now what Medicines soever are allowably used, they are set down plainly and fully in the Dispensato∣ries, with their preparations, use, and dose. And for the regulating of ingeni∣ous men in finding out new receipts, the Herbals are compiled, in which the form, names, places of growth, and all the like circumstances of Herbs, Plants, Roots, and Trees are set down, with their qualifications of temperature, virtues, preparation, and dose. Lastly, as every practitioner is of a more happy wit, some do concin∣nate
the Theory, others the practick of the Art, so that the world is al∣most full of the multitudes of vo∣lumes which are written concerning this Art, some shewing its Method, others its Practick, a third sort com∣piling volumes only stuffed with Re∣ceipts. Of such Books there is scarce a Language barren, so that whoever hath a minde to apply himself to the study of Physick, he need not want Authors; in whom he may fully ac∣cording to the received Doctrine, finde the Anatomy of the Body with every part of it, the Systeme of all diseases, with a particular account of every one by it self, and that Dia∣gnostically and Prognostically, with the Remedies of them, corraded out of the most authentick Authors, as Sennertus, Fernelius, Fucksius, and the like. The true Chymist, is he who by an earnest desire of knowledge is
carried on to the search of Nature, to the discovery of its defects, and the remedies thereof, and from an ear∣nest desire of being profitable to those among whom he lives, he is willing to undergoe any pains, re∣membring the Adagy, Virtutem posuere dii sudore parandam. He considers with himself the sad state in which Mankinde is, in re∣spect to distempers, of which being truly sensible, and withall remem∣bring, that the same God who had laid this burden upon the Earth, that thornes and thistles it should bring forth to man all the daies of his life, untill he should return to the earth from whence he was taken, who being dust was to return to dust, the same God I say had created a Medicine out of the earth, which he that was wise should not contemn: considering also how the mercies o
the most High were over all his works, whose Justice reached to the clouds, but his Mercy unto the hea∣vens; he concluded that God out of his infinite mercy had provided in Nature a Remedy against all infir∣mities and maladies, could but we be so wise as to finde it out. Hereupon he spareth not his soul from studious search and enquiry, but by knocking at the throne of grace in prayer, and seeking in the creatures without weariness or pre∣cipitancy, he makes it his whole work to study and endeavour the finding out of those Medicines, which may effectually evidence out the pos∣sessor of them to be such whom the Lord hath chosen for a Physician, and whom he hath appointed to be honoured for necessiy sake. The evidece of his call is not his Ladies hand with a smooth tongue, which is the usual Diploma of a Goosequill Doctor, who when he
comes to visit his patient, after a few methodical Queries, and upon them a Scholastick Declamation extem∣pore upon the Symptomes; cals for his pen and ink, and writes a Bill to his Apothecary of a foot long, ac∣cording as the Patient is in purse: which being done he expects his Fee, and in the mean time is in fee with his Apothecary, (I know what I say) who annually allows the Do∣ctor so much for packing in a com∣pany of dear Simples into the bill, for many of which he hath an under∣hand dispensation (upon the notice of a private mark) to substitute quid pro quo and some things to leave out: this is a pretty Cheat, but very usual in that Tribe: but I pass that. On the other hand this true Son of Art, he considers the vast dis∣proportion between the Galenical promises, and their performances, and pondering the Reason of it, he findes it can be no otherwise.
First, because of their supine neglect of Nature her self, contenting them∣selves with turning over of leaves, and through laziness choosing rather o subscribe, then to undergoe the rouble & pains of search & inquiry. Which alone defect, if it were not otherwise aggravated, were sufficient o frustrate both their promises, and the patients hopes, and that in a ma∣nifold respect. For who is it that is but moderate∣ly versed in the principles of Na∣ture, that knowes not that diseases new and new do daily come upon the stage? God punishing, as I may so speak, our unheard of sins with un∣heard of Judgements. Which the Doctors when they meet with, they are beyond their rea∣ding, and cry out of a new Disease, yet content themselves with the old Me∣thod. Nay what more common, then to have a society of Doctors, or con∣sultation
called, of whom scarce two will agree together in the stating of the disease, and all at their wits end as to the matter of cure. And besides this, consider how the most of the ring leaders of the Ga∣lenical rabble, are of different Coun∣treys, and of different Ages in which they lived, in the which respect they can not be looked on as agreeing to those times and places for which they are made use of. For in several cli∣mates, there is not only a great di∣versity of Simples as to their nature and virtue, but also the bodies o men do wonderfully alter according to the soyl they live in, according to the Adagy, Solo natura subest. What then more absurd, then to make use of the prescription of  Grecian, who lived and wrote 120 years agoe, and to apply it to an Eng∣lish temper? especially since ne
diseases have appeared since which never were before, which once ha∣ving received admittance, never are extirpated (as to their species) but by their complication do not only aggravate, but also notably alter dis∣eases, so that what formerly might easier have been cured, become now more obstinate and unmasterable. I may here take notice of the un∣faithfulness and abominable neglect committed in the preparing of Medi∣cines, only what I before touched, I would first more fully illustrate, namely, that it is not an exotical me∣dicine, that is or may be proper for an English constitution. And first I need not urge that God hath abundantly provided for mans wel-being, where ever he hath alot∣ted him a place of being, since that only opposeth the necessity, not the efficacy of transmarine Simples; for a man may in any place of the world, if he please, and can get it, eat only
what is of Englands growth, though he live in Spain, but it is not neces∣sary; so he may use exotick Simples, although he be not bound to them: yet this I shall not doubt to insert, that as no food, so no medicaments are so proper for our English bodies, as those which England produceth. And so in other Countreys, as France, Germany, Spain, or any other Terri∣tory, their native Simples are suffici∣cient, as for the conservation of their bodies in its integrity, so for the re∣stauration of its defects, if so that any were so wise as to be able to collect, and to apply the same. But as nothing that is excellent wants its difficulty, so the attaining of the skill of Simples is a work of no small trouble; experience hath taught the world how great a master∣piece it is to gather and order To∣bacco aright, not to speak of the vast disproportion which the difference of Climates addes to its goodness;
it is notoriously known to all that are experienced in it, that the order∣ng, manuring, gathering, and cu∣ring of it, and after the making it up and keeping it, may with a smal neg∣ect, make that which otherwise would be very good, to become lit∣tle worth or quite naught. And let not any imagine, that medicinal herbs require less care in their choice, manuring, climate, soyle, gathering, ordering and keeping, then Tobacco doth. I shall not inlarge, the exam∣ple brought, if considered and ap∣plyed, will convince many whom it concerneth, of gross errors commit∣ted in this particular. Thou knowest, O Man, if good or bad Tobacco be brought thee, and canst value it accordingly, though it concern only an unprofitable stinking vapour; but if any herb for thy health be to be procured, thou art in this wholly ignorant, and such as should provide for thee herein are
as ignorant as thy self, and the Do∣ctor that prescribes it to thee is most ignorant of all. As for Simples, are they not col∣lected by women, where they can finde them, without distinction of time when, and season in which they are gathered? and if any herbs grow in gardens, how are they ordered? is not the chief care by much watering to make them grow as rank as may be? which if for distillation, I mat∣ter it not much, for the unpro∣fitable flegm only is attained by di∣stillation, without previous macera∣tion by ferment, but as for dryed herbs, (the flowers set aside) how un∣seasonably are they gathered, (oft in rainy weather) and then how are they dryed oft in the Sun, until they be as dry that they may be powdered; wch drying, how much it prejudiceth the virtue, I appeal to such as make hay, which if sear-dryed in the Sun, is half in half damnified; but if cut in
rain is much the worse; but if so the Sun be clouded & the air moist, how ft do herbs mould or must before hey be dried, either being laid too hick for want of room, or at best done n a dusty floor, where they lie so ong untill they be as dry as powder; nd yet if close kept will grow musty,  be tainted with wormes: therefore any keep their herbs when dryed in n open place, not only to the dimi∣ishing, but in short time to the de∣troying of their virtue. Yet the Apothecary who buyes hem, must not straightway reject hem, when insipid, but must put hem away in the first place, keeping hose last which may be preserved ongest. Therefore to remedy and prevent any of these inconveniencies, the tupid Doctor, who will not stick to orrow his practick from a Farrier, with this pretence, that it must be ap∣lyed according to his method, learns
the good huswifes trade of Candy∣ing, Conserving, and making into Marmalet, and Syrups as many Sim∣ples as may be, the rest he commands to be compounded into Electuaries, Lozenges, or the like; and with these he vapours and brustles like Dametas in his military accoutre∣ments, vowing revenge on any dis∣ease that dare look him in the face. And what cannot be performed by these, he hath another course in rea∣diness for such malepert maladies, tormenting the body that dare har∣bour an insolent distemper in defi∣ance of his reverent gravity, which therefore must suffer the martyr∣dom of Diagridium, Alahandal, Ja∣lap, Euphorbium, or the like, and be punished with Phlebotomy, Scari∣fications, Blisters, Fontinels, &c. and starved with cooling Julips, bar∣ly broths, and diet drinks, till it shall at last be contented to yeeld up that refractary ghost which could
not be scared aut of its extravagancy, with the vengeance of the reverent Colleagues of the Colledge of Do∣ctors, in despite of which many a soul dies of no other mortal disease but of his Doctor, who yet because he did it by Rules of Art is well Feed for his pains, and methodical but∣chery. CHAP. III. BUt to return to our matter whence we digressed, namely to compare a true Chymist with our modern Goosquil Doctors, to see to which the Mountebank is nearest of kin. First it must be granted that the whole of a real or pretended Phy∣sician, may be referred to these two heads, namely, the knowing the Dis∣ease, and finding out the Remedy: the latter of which is either theore∣tically
to know the medicine or, pra∣ctically to provide and apply the same. As for the Mountebanks Philoso∣phy, it is usually the same with the old Wives, or Quacks; but if it any whit excell, it is gotten out of Ga∣lenical Authors, which are to be had in almost any language. But let their method speak their original; is not their intent one, and their progress one, (only differ in the means) with the Galenical Tribe? They want the distinguishing marks of a true Physician, and there∣fore they tread the same steps, though with a more rude and resolute pace. In bloud-letting, purging, vomi∣ting, cauterizing, vesicating, making carminatives, giving clysters, scarify∣ing, and cordials they all agree, only differ in the purges, vomits, &c. And many of them use the very same things with the other Doctors, only differ in the Dose, the one ven∣turing
the harm in hope to do good, the other for credit sake resolving if he do no good, yet to do no hurt, which he doth notwithstanding, only he that doth least hurt is most com∣mended. What if some of the same Tribe, finding the insufficiency of Vegetables, flie unto Minerals, as Saul to the Witch of Endor, doth this straight make them Chymists? Just as if a rustick weary of his cal∣ling, should resolve to turn a Joyner, and endevour to plain his boards with a howe, his intention will not make him a Joyner. Tell not of Empericks, that is such who prepare by the fire, for what is the ordinary preparations made with but by the fire? do not the Apothe∣caries decoct, extract, make Syrups, Conserves, Lozenges, &c. by the fire? Or if you respect Distillation, are not waters of all sorts distilled in the common way? Or is an Empe∣rick he who deals in Minerals and
Metals, and calcined bodies? what are then your Steel Powder, Gold in Alchermes, Vitriol in Vomits, An∣timony in Crocus, burnt Ivory, &c. and to make up a total reconciliati∣on betwixt Empericks and Galenists, are not now all vulgar preparations of Minerals, prostituted in every Apothecaries shop; and yet the Art of Medicine among our reverent Do∣ctors reputed the same as of old? What then? O their method! their method! this is the hidden stone, and secret mark, which distinguisheth them; where then the same method is used, there is the same way pro∣fessed: but Mountebanks, Quacks, Old Wives, and all that rabble, use the same method in curing. If it be objected, that they have not skill to discern when this, when that remedy is to be applyed, this accuses their sufficiency, not their profession. It is not then the materials used, but the preparation of the materials,
so as to be able to effect what the Physician promiseth, and the Patient expects, surely, safely, and speedily, that distinguisheth a true Son of Art from pretending bunglers; of which some are more crafty and cautious, others more ignorant and rashly venturous, yet both more distinct from true Artists, then from one ano∣ther. If Nature had made true Medi∣cines ready prepared to hand for eve∣ry disease, that it were no more then to pluck them as an Apple from the tree, then indeed a distinction might be made of professors of the Art of Medicine, according to the materials wrought upon. But contrariwise it is sadly evident, that very few Sim∣ples are endowed with a medicinal virtue without virulency, and those also have their excellency obstructed with the gross feculency, which growes together with the spiritual incture, and as a shell doth hidden∣ly
contain the same, so that without some previous preparations few things are worthy the name of Me∣dicaments. Now what preparation is usual for vegetal Simples? only decoction, or infusion, or conserving with Su∣gar, or Honey, whereby the good is not so separated from the bad, but that several crudities remain: but of this Helmont hath at large treated, I shall not repeat. It would be a tedious Wild-goose chase to trace their medicines, and re∣fute them, for that will be but to (agere actum) and I intend here an Apology, not a charge; a defensive, not an offensive conflect: I shall come therefore to state our Case, for till that be done it is a vain thing to con∣tend in words. First of all we differ from the Goosquil Tribe in the Theoretical discovery of Diseases, and secondly in our Practical cure of them.
Now as to the Theory of Dis∣eases, and the Philosophical contem∣plation of Simples, it is not essential to a Physician; for a man may know the remedies with which to cure all diseases, and yet erre very much in the discovery of Causes; for the remedy being to the disease as water to fire, which will undoubtedly quench it, as a man may know cer∣tainly by water to quench fire, and yet erre in the Philosophical appre∣prehension of the same; so may a man by a proper remedy, rightly, and in due proportion applyed, cer∣tainly cure the disease, and be able to distinguish the same generally, though he be not able to finde our and apprehend the manner of its ori∣ginal, with its occasional causes, progress and variations. Nor let this seem a Paradox, for it may easily be evinced against the most snarling gainsayer: for con∣sider the forementioned example
of quenching fire by water, and it may be made unquestionable. What rustick that doth not know that water is for the quenching of fire, and will give a very near guess how much water will quench so much fire, and yet how many of our School Philosophers can assign the true cause of that effect? it is not water as water, for milk, whey, wine∣vinegar, &c. will do the same; nor yet as cold, for hot water, and other hot liquors will perform it as well as cold; nor yet as moist, for oyl and oleaginous moistures, being thrown on fire in one measure encreaseth it, and in another measure will quench it; as a week of a candle or lamp may be drowned with too much tallow or oyle. So that in very deed the Philosophical speculation doth follow practical knowledge, and ex∣perience denominates that science, which else would be but bare opi∣nion. But of this I speak sufficient∣ly
in my large Treatise called Or∣ganu Philosophiae novum, and shall not in this place repeat, what there is sufficiently proved and confirmed. Therefore the effects of diseases so far as they are obvious to every observer, can instruct any who make it their work to be conversant there∣in, that are of capacity, so as to be able to judge and distinguish one disease from another, and by the Symptomes to discover if or no it do proceed in the ordinary course of the same malady, or if by complica∣tion it doth alter, and how: this is as much as is absolutely requisite for a Physician in the knowledge of dis∣eases, for this knowledge doth essen∣tially conduce to the cure, but to be able to unfold the quiddity of it, its efficient and continent causes, the material and occasionate, with other curiosities which a Philosopher doth contemplate upon, and in which the intellect is occupied, this adornes
but doth not constitute a Physician. So then the absolute things re∣quisite in one who would consciona∣bly undertake the lives of the sick, are first to know how to unlock those medicines which the Almigh∣ty hath created, and to prepare them, and after how, and when, and to whom to apply them, and how to order and dispose the Patient so, as that he may reap that good from them which by careful administrati∣on of them is expected. Mistake me not, I do not deny, nay I confidently affirm, that he who is endowed with wisdom from above, to be so curious and so diligent in his search, as to attain the noble me∣dicines, which the Lord hath crea∣ted for mans relief, and unspeaka∣ble comfort, he, if he prove but so observant in the administration as he was acute in the preparation, can∣not but so far be inlightned from Natures light in these observations, as
to apprehend the causes of the dis∣eases, and their whole quiddity or being, which may by arguments (à posteriori) be collected from their ef∣fects, as likewise he may be able to demonstrate (à posteriori) the cause and manner of cures wrought by medicines (a work most worthily performed by noble Helmont) which contemplation will wonderfully de∣light a true Son of this Art; but yet as I said before, this doth fol∣low and adorn, not precede and con∣stitute a Physician. And this I shall adde, that the soul, which is a I may say ipse in ho∣mine homo, when once an effect is apparent, and so known, as to be∣come a mechanism, doth no farther any more reap content from it, unless it be in reference to some de∣duction it gathers from it, to the finding out of some new hidden truth; nor doth the soul ever feed on it more as upon its object, origi∣nally,
directly, and in an absolute consideration, no more then in the knowing how to make a fire, or that the fire will burn, boyl, dry, &c. Therefore justly saith the wise man, that in much knowledge is much vanity and vexation of spirit: but this only as a digression. To return therefore, we conclude that to a true Physician is required to know if a disease be probably curable, and if so, then how: as for instance, the plague-tokens appear∣ing are rightly judged mortal, and so may any such state be reputed in which nature will admit of no reme∣dy, nor death accept of any truce. The careful observer of these things will by experience learn to distinguish between dangerous and desperate cases, and so may order himself accordingly, but in impossi∣ble cases he shall not meddle.
CHAP. IV. ANd here me thinks I see a Ga∣lenist beginning to frame a re∣ply, who after a few course com∣plements, doth thus out of his won∣ted gravity, seek to defend his own faction. Do not we (quoth he) the like in effect? for we by our Art di∣stinguish between easie, dangerous, and desperate diseases, which we therefore undertake or leave accor∣dingly. For if there be only a light distemper, as foulness of the sto∣mack, or bad humours clogging or obstructing the liver, or the like; we then by an usual purge, or vomit, and by bloudletting, and glysters remove the same; but if the distemper be more violent, then by our Method we help that, for that is our mystery, which the prating Chymists not knowing, cannot therefore do that by their medicines, which we can
by our method, which is the master∣piece of our Art; for we are like to skilful workmen amid a number of tools, we know our work, and so can, as cause presents, and as Symptomes do move, call in for this or that medi∣cine, and as occasion requires we can use external artificial helps, when Nature is not in fit case to be provo∣ked by a violent process. This is the good old way, and it is the safe way. But these furnace-mongers would perswade the world, that by medicines prepared by their Art, dis∣eases may be cut down as it were with a sithe, which for all their boa∣sting will not be. These with seve∣ral other things are pretended by them to conceal their ignorance in so blinde progresses. But as it is an easie thing to lie hid in the dark, the mantle of the night hiding that which the Sun discovers, it will not be amiss to proceed to the true course of curing diseases, and by
it our adversaries will be easily quel∣led. Basilius and Suchten, both no∣ble and worthy Artists, advise as ma∣ny as have given their name to Art, to be doing, and not to contend in bare words, for it is as impossible to convince the Galenists with words without works, as it was for Christ & his Apostles to have convinced the Jewes by preaching without mira∣cles; therefore I shall first give you the Character of a true Physician: and secondly, shew you what his work is. A true Physician is he whom God hath qualified with a longing desire to know nature in her operations, her integrity and desects, and how they may be amended. For the at∣tainment of which he doth ask, seek and knock with diligence, patience, and constancy, till it be given and opened unto him, his heart is not set upon gain, but out of charity to the distressed he doth persist in this pur∣suit
of knowledge, and the merciful God hears him, and gives him what he seeks for: then having received his talent he doth not bury it in a napkin, but doth improve it, untill with it he gain two, and with them five, and with them ten talents. He knowes that diseases are all in their kinde curable without exception, death only being out of the power of any man or means, the definitive sentence being past irrevocably. He laments the sad Catalogues of poor mortals (the distressed members of Christ Jesus) who flying from the Lion of sickness, meet with a Bear in stead of a true Physician, who in stead of bread gives them a stone, and in stead of fish a serpent, and yet these are the fathers of the sick, so pretended to be, but like old Saturn they devour and make a prey of their children. He also that is a true Physician doth not seek fame and honour so
much as the good of those he under∣takes, nor doth he startle at the sad catalogue of incurable diseases which the School Doctors have most shamefully compiled, which he by his Medicines is able to overcome as the valiant champion is reported to have conquered the dovouring Monster. His work is not to spend his time in turning over of leaves; but he makes use of Authors so as not to conclude any thing upon bare reading with∣out trial. In a word, he so behaves himself as if his great content pro∣posed were, whether to be more as∣siduous in discovering nature, or se∣dulous in conquering diseases: of which the latter is the main end he aims at in the former. Now I shall briefly discover the objections, made by Galenists against this way of medicine, and shall so fully answer them that there shall be no scruple left.
First of all they accuse Chymical Medicines as virulent, too hot, and therefore unfit to be given, as oft in stead of curing encreasing the dis∣ease; they are (say they) a little too strong for our constitution, being for the most part mineral and metal∣line, or else they are saline, which are very sharp and corrosive, or of a fiery sulphurous nature, which there∣fore in stead of cooling and refresh∣ing, do inflame the body inwardly: therefore say they such medicines are dangerous and desperate, which if they were not, they would (as they make their patients believe) use them themselves. In such dis∣courses you shall have them run at random, and their aim in all is to make the sick believe, that their me∣dicaments only are gentle, safe and agreeable to nature, the other forci∣ble, violent, and desperate, which no man but a mad man would take.
This is, to speak the truth, the on∣ly main objection which Galenists usually produce against Chymical medicines; and this they varnish over with many specious colours to make the patient believe, that to med∣dle with a Chymical medicament, is no other then to cast out the Devil by Belzebub, or according to the old proverb, to cure a desperate dis∣ease by a desperate medicine. Therefore I shall briefly, yet fully answer this cavil, and so answer it, that it may appear to the eye of any judicious man to be but a meer Mormo which the Galenists have in∣vented, to scare the rude and igno∣rant with, as nurses use to affright children with tales of Robin Good∣fellow, Raw head and bloudy bones, and the like. And first as to the point of Viru∣lency, which is a very great Bug∣bear, and enough to deter the most confident Patient, if once you can
perswade him the remedies he is to take to be of an exquisite virulency, for so a very smal error in the dose, will hazard the life in stead of con∣quering the distemper: poyson I grant is a dangerous, nay a despe∣rate thing to deal with, nor is it good to admit of it into the body upon any pretence, but that Chymical Me∣dicines are such, that is the point in controversie. Calvin in his Preface to the King of France, in which he defends his Religion from the foul aspersions laid on it by Papists, hath this most just plea, namely to call for his ad∣varsaries Reasons, before he be con∣demned by their Criminations; for if it be enough to accuse, who may or can expect to be found inno∣cent? So say I, our Antagonists raise a great dust concerning poyson, viru∣lency and malignity, which they pre∣tend is in Chymical Medicaments,
and with this clamour they have filled the world, and buzzed it into the ears and hearts of as many as by their impudent confident railing they could incline to embrace this opinion, whose aspersions now I shall endevour to wipe off. And here I shall entreat the Rea∣ders candor in pondering the weight of Arguments on both sides, before he proceed to censure: for which end I shall minde thee of one general rule, which is in the urging of all Controversies, to observe the inte∣rest of each party, and then you will confess, that what ever is said on either side and not proved, savours of passion, not of Reason. Consider that the Galenical Tribes credit, honour, reputation, and for∣tunes do all depend on impugning this way of Chymical preparations: no marvel then if you hear from them Demetrius his outcry, Great is the Diana of the Ephesians, especi∣ally
since the moving cause is the same, namely, Sirs you know that by this Art we get our wealth, our ho∣nour, and all, and therefore it be∣hoves to oppose that upstart Chymi∣stry, which will (if it once be ac∣cepted into the world) make us to be as contemptible as common Fid∣lers. Hinc illae lachrymae. Hence it is that you hear such terrible newes concerning this Art of Pyrotechny; for this Art requireth (in a sense) a new birth or regeneration: as then it was an irresoluble riddle to Nico∣demus, that a man when he was old should enter into his mothers womb, and again be born; so is it an insuf∣ferable task for an old Putationer, who hath by prescription attained the reputation of a skilful Doctor, to make loss of all this his imaginary skill, and to employ his time, pains, study, and moneys, in the attaining of that which he either neglecting o slighting in his youth, is in his age
as capable of as an Asse is to play on the Harp; there is therefore no way left for him to uphold his own reputation, then by casting durt on that Art which is so diametrically opposite to his former way of pro∣fit. Nor is it any thing of weight that he urgeth his as the old way, and condemns the other as new; for er∣ror wants but a few hours of the Age of truth, nor was this old way elder then error, and therefore to plead its antiquity is a fallacious argument of its authority and ve∣rity. Yet could I (if it made to my pre∣sent purpose) trace this noble Art of true Chymical Philosophy to a far more ancient pedigree then Ga∣len or Hippocrates either, although Hippocrates was as incomparably different from the other, as truth is from error. But as I said before, here lies the
very knot of all, the Galenists have a Trade which is supported by Garru∣lity, performed with ease and idle∣ness, and accompanied with riches, credit, esteem and honour, their work is not attended with any pains, un∣till they come to practise, and then that only consists in visits, which pains is the key of their wealth. As for the properation of Medica∣ments, that the Doctor little ac∣quaints himself with it, his Theory consisting only in turning over of leaves, and his Practise in tossing of Pisse-pots and writing of Bils: this, O! this is their Diana they so much admire, and propound to the credu∣lous world to be adored. But now a true son of Art he is not so blassed, for his interest doth not hang on such a hinge, but he pro∣pounds the workman to be judged by his work, nor can there be too many endowed with this true skil, for in the search of nature there are
infinite secrets, and those lucriferous to the Artist, so that he need not gape after the practise of medicine for gain, God in mercy dispensing his gifts for the use of mankinde, gives such to whom he imparts this skil, an heart to improve it, without the sordid by-ends of gain and pro∣fit. But admit that every Galenist were indeed a true Chymist, what disad∣vantage could accrew thereby to any true Artist? for every one would have sufficient imployment, so many are the sad diseases to which mortal man is subject. Experience sheweth that the Gale∣nists envie not Chymists as Physi∣cians, but as Chymists; for other∣wise they can with patience bear the daily swarming of their own Tribe, so fruitful is that profession of its Clients, that it is incredible what a number there is of them in and about London.
Now it is not to be doubted, but all or most of them get a living by their Art, besides old Wives, Quacks, Mountebanks, Barber-surgeons and their men, Apothecaries, &c. who all as confidently pretend to a pa∣trimony in the Art of Medicine, as if they were the natural sons of Ga∣len and Hippocrates. Yet sad expe∣rience doth teach, that for all this rabble of Physicians, there is not a third part of diseases cured, nor a tenth part by the skill of the Doctor. If then so many get a living by pretending to that they know not, and undertaking what they cannot performe, this livelihood would not be diminished, but rather encreased if all were holpen that are underta∣ken, and those moreover who in numberless swarmes lie up and down in Hospitals and Spitles, and many who languish at home in private both hopeless and helpless.
But if once true Artists were countenanced and embraced, scarce the tenth pretender but would be thrown under the board: for true medicine is not prostituted in formal receipts, to be prepared by the hand of any blundering Apothecary, but it is one of the choice secrets of na∣ture, which she hath with great care locked up, nor will she open them to any who have not the true keyes. It is not an overly reading of Fer∣nelius, Avicen, Galen, that can enti∣tle a man a Son of this Art, but it re∣quires a mental man, patient, labori∣ous, and one who is not niggardly in expences, such a man must toyl with∣out wearisomness; and although af∣ter several years searching, with the expence of many pounds; he hit not what he aims at, yet must he still patiently proceed, which task is more than Herculean for a lazy Pisse∣prophet.
CHAP. V. BUt to come to the matter pro∣pounded, namely concerning poysons: of which aspersion I shall acquit the right Chymicall Medi∣cines. Poyson properly is that which by an over powering activity in the bo∣dy, doth destroy the vitals, and is of divers sorts; some are putrifactive poysons, others corrosive, others nar∣cotick, &c. This in general concerning their Nature, but in particular they are all found either in the Animal, Ve∣getable, or Mineral Kingdome. Not to speak of those endemical malig∣nant vapours, which infect the air oft-times; nor of the virulency of the Pestilence, Leprosie, &c. which oft doth seat it self in the very wals of houses, cloth, paper, &c.
But although there are several sorts of malignities, which are pro∣perly so called poysons, yet in the common acceptation of the word, it denotes such a thing by which ei∣ther man or beast is destroyed, and that either by the eating of it, or by its odour or touch, not to mention that poyson of the Basilisk which some authors affirm to kill with the sight. So that though a man die of the Pestilence, or of the Leprosie, Pox or the like, which all have their specificated poysons, yet do we not use to say that such died of poyson, the specificateness of the name of the disease swallowing up the generality of the denomination of poyson in such cases. Of such things which are reputed poysons, some as the biting of Ser∣pents, the biting of mad dogs, &c. are remote from this our purpose, such poysons being only in the power of that angry beast that in∣flicts
it, and such venomes usually die with the creature, according to the Adagy, Mortuâ bestiâ, moritur venenum. So that in vain should we get the teeth of dead Serpents, or the sting of dead Bees or Hornets, all their virulency being then extinct. Other poysons are which infect man and not beast, others both man and beast. Of the first sort are Spiders and Toads, which Apes, Hens and Ducks will eat familiarly, yet without any effect of poyson: other poysons there are which will not kill Dogs, Cats, &c. which yet will kill men, not because they are not also mor∣tal to beasts, but the Dog or Cat finding the operation, being able to vomit at pleasure, escape the danger; wch man wanting that faculty, fals in∣to. Hereto agrees that by Sallet oyl
given copiously in time, and vomit by it provoked, many poysons are happi∣y escaped, which otherwise would be ethal. Those which are mortal poysons in their proper nature, do not cease to be mortall, because they are some∣times accidentally escaped, but are so to be reputed notwithstanding. Before I proceed any farther into this discovery, I shall lay down a few certain and infallible Rules, which may make very much to the informing of the candid Reader, of the Truth in this controversie. The first is, That nothing which is not of its own nature poysonous, can by any true Chymical operation be made a poyson. Secondly, Nothing which is of its own nature poysonous and viru∣lent, can by any true Chymical pre∣paration have its virulency advanced, but rather diminished.
Thirdly, Nothing is so poysonous but by its true Chymical preparati∣on, doth wholly lose its virulent na∣ture without the least footsteps o the same. These three Rules, though at first they to many may appear paradoxi∣cal, yet I shall so explain and con∣firm them, as that they may evident∣ly appear true. The first Rule at first sight may appear untrue, and may be our mo∣dern putationers (who think they have sufficient insight even in Chy∣mical secrets to serve their turn and to denominate them Artists) b thus impugned, Do not, say they your best Authors in the Science o Chymistry, Basilius, Valentinus, Pa∣racelsus, Quercetanus, and Helmon all confess that by the Art of Chy∣mistry many things in their own na∣ture not virulent, are exalted to be come dangerous poysons: instance i Aqua fortis, Aqua regis, Mercury
sublimate, oyl of Vitriol, &c. which of things at least not poysonous be∣come most dangerous, and lethal. To this I answer two waies, first of all, that it is a misconceit that the forementioned things are become poysons by such a preparation: for as for Aqua fortis, Aqua regis, Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of Salt-peter or of common Salt, they are not poy∣sons, but Spirits eminent in activity, on which (being distilled with the extream fire of Reverberation) the fire hath instamped a more then or∣dinary fiery quality, which therefore if given alone, burn and mortifie where ever they touch any thing that is vital, (so far as their activi∣ty reacheth) yet mingled with wine, beer, or water, may be taken in the same, nay a greater quantity (then alone would be mortal) without the least effect of danger, nay rather they become wholsom and medicinal, as namely Oyl of Vitriol and Sulphur
for the extinguishing the preter∣natural heat and drouth in Feavers, the Spirit of Salt for the ardors of the urine is an incomparable remedy: so Aqua fortis is not venomous but diaphoretick, if given in wine so min∣gled that it may only be made acide by it: Spirit of Salt-peter is much of the same virtue with Spirit of Vitriol, yea and Vinegar it self, may be so rectified from its feces, as in a small dose given alone to become mortal; so Hony, Sugar, and almost what not? But if they were really and formal∣ly transmuted into poysons, they could not be so diffused, but though without any taste or perceptible qua∣lity, they would certainly be mor∣tal. It appears then that many distil∣led Spirits made by a strong fire, as also many fixed Salts, viz. Pot∣ash, &c. being strongly calcined, be∣come really deadly, that is, by being made corrosive, but not venomous, which therefore diffused in sufficient
liquor may without prejudice, or rather with much profit be taken, which else would be hurtful, yea and if their activity be by any object on which they will work satiated, they may then be taken alone, as Oyl of Vitriol mixed with a proportiona∣ble quantity of Salt of Tartar or any other Salt becomes almost insipid, and may be taken in ten times the dose, which would be mortal in their simplicity. So Aqu fortis if it be poured on Silver or Iron, and boyled with it so long as its dissolving vir∣tue lasts, then the metal precipitated, and the liquor boyled up till the Salt be dry, it becomes a medicine, though not comparable to many Chymical preparations, yet not so contemptible as the Galenical drugs. As for Mercury sublimate, which may be thought to bear the greatest shew of Reason to the contrary of this Rule, forasmuch as a whole
pound of Argent vive crude may safely be taken when as 3 or 4 grains of it sublimed is immediately mortal. To that I answer, that there is a great error in the experiment, which well considered, will carry a clean di∣stinct face from what it at first ap∣pears withall. For we know the nature of Argent vive to be salivative, and of a strangling quality, affecting especially the throat, jawes and head of him that takes it; yea though ta∣ken by dose, or by fume, or by in∣unction, yet it still betraies it self by that infamous operation, taking its recourse to those parts forementio∣ned, yea though it be precipitated, or dulcified vulgarly, or distilled into a Spirit or Oyl according the Art of common Chymists, by which it hath some other operation, as vomi∣tive, purgative, or sudorifick; yet as the Devil is fabled not able to hide his cloven foot, so Mercury will
still be betraying its salivating qua∣lity. As for the corrosiveness of Subli∣mate, that is to be attributed to the Saline Spirits, which sublime up with the Mercury, by which it is not at all intrinsecally altered, and if it have any quality of operation more then its own, that is to be attributed to the Salts. As for the large dose of Mercury which may be given without any danger, it is to be understood that being a very ponderous body, and fluid, if it be given in so great a dose, it straight passeth all the bowels, and soon voids it self at the siege, and is accounted the last remedy for the twisting of the smal guts. So that its nature in operation is not to be judged by such a cursory experiment, for otherwise if a few grains unpre∣pared, be mixed up in any pill and given, or a small quantity mixed in n oyle and applyed by inunction,
it will shew in a short time its own na∣tural operation, and the same is the operation of Mercury any other waies vulgarly prepared, only the corrosiveness of some preparations above others are to be attributed to some Saline Spirits that are joyned with it, by which the Mercury is re∣duced into small atomes, and the true operation of the Mercury is hidden under the operation of the Saline Spirits that do accompany it. Nor yet can Mercury by his or any other preparation whatsoever be brought to become a reall poyson, for Sublimate being dissolved in wa∣ter, and the Mercury separated from the Salts with which it was subli∣med by precipitation, or revificati∣on, (as any trivial Chymist knowes how) the Salt then decocted to the consistence of Oyl of Vitriol or dry if you please, is so far from poyson, that it excels the best Medicaments the Galenists have, as I shall declare in its due place.
Hereto agrees, that the most corro∣sive sublimate, being resublimed with other crude Mercury, loseth its cor∣rosive quality, and becomes Mercu∣rius dulcis, commonly given to the quantity of two scruples, the eighth part of which before dulcification were suddenly mortal. This is my first answer to the ob∣jection made against the first rule before laid down, viz. that by no Chymical preparation that which in it self is not poyson, will become ve∣nomous: which I shall briefly sum up, and so pass to my second and more satisfactory answer. I yeeld that by some preparations many things become corrosive, but not venomous, the one by dilating in any liquor being extinguished being no way dangerous; the other although infused with never so much liquor, yet still is mortal notwithstanding. But secondly, such operations fore∣mentioned, are not properly Chy∣mical
preparations, nor the distin∣guishing badges of the Son of Art; for the Galenists have ravished them into their shops, and use them as commonly as any, nay most of all; for a true Chymist very seldom useth any of them, some of them never; the Spirits of Salts he useth as occa∣sion offers, as also of Sulphur, but for any of the vulgar preparations of Mercury he abhors them. We deny not but the Spirit of Vitriol is a noble Medicine, but not that which is sold commonly, which is totally adulterated, which a very easie trial will discover: for example, take of it about an ounce, less or more, and rectifie it in a glass, you shall see how much is mixed of flegm, and that the tincture is wholly sophisticate, which will therefore remain in the bottom of the glass & discolour it of a black colour, but all that distils over will be clear and white like fountain water. The occasion of which adul∣teration,
is because some true sons of Art have used a Spirit of Vitriol which is made by cohobation, (a work too laborious for a Renegado Chymist) which is of a pure golden tincture, and fragrant, which being a noble Medicine, and having by proof been found more effectual then Galenical slops, the Doctors there∣fore willing to get that Spirit, have employed Mercenary Chymists, so stiled, to draw both that and such other Medicaments, foolishly con∣ceiving, that every one that was a furnace-monger was straight a Chy∣mist. These Apostates I say are no more to be accounted what they pre∣tend, then the Doctors themselves, because they have been dub'd in the University, are to be accounted Do∣ctors. Therefore let me not be mistaken, to be thought to plead for such vul∣gar preparations of Chymical Me∣dicines,
for they are no more Chy∣mical then any other Decoctions, Syrups, &c. that the Galenical Cooks prepare. For as I said before, it is not the subjects wrought upon, that distin∣guish true Chymists from the Goos∣quill tribe, for they use Minerals and Metals as confidently as any, and I doubt not but they would scorn that any Simple, either Animal, Vegetal, or Mineral, should be accounted alien from their Art. CHAP. VI. COnsider then their method of preparations of Animals and Vegetals, and then see if the vul∣gar preparation of Minerals hath not the same stamp. Some Vegetables they stamp to powder and searce, and this they
make into species, as they term them, others they decoct, conserve, in∣fuse, candy, or make into Tablets, &c. So Animals, as the inward of Hens Gizards, Sheep and Goose dung, Al∣bum graecum, Fox Lungs, Canthari∣des, and many Insects which they use as Cochineel, &c. some are powde∣red and so given, others in Electua∣ries, Loch Sanum, and boles. So Minerals, some are used in powder, as Crocus Martis, steel powder, Gold in Alchermes, white Vitriol for vomits, Bezoar-stone, Irish-slate; others made into un∣guents, as Mercury for inunctions, Cerusse, minium, &c. others beaten up with other ingredients, as Arse∣nick in one Alexipharmacum, &c. others are calcined barely, as vitrum Antimonii without Borax, burnt Ivo∣ry, &c. which is a medium between an Animal and a Mineral: others
are sublimed barely; as flores Sulphu∣ris, Antimonii, &c. others are distil∣led barely, as Spirit. Vitrioli, Sa∣lis, Sulphuris, Saltpeter; and others are sublimed with mixture, as Mer∣cury sublimate, and Mercury dulcis, &c. all which operations are but analogical to their usual preparati∣ons of Vegetals and Animals: and all this is done, and used and prescri∣bed in prosecution of one and the same method, with other of their A∣pothecary drugs. And as the Galenists may and do use Minerals, so we do use both Ve∣getables and Animals, only we differ in our preparations, and in our inten∣tions in application. But of this in its place. The second Rule may be con∣tradicted and opposed, as for in∣stance in the flowers and vitrum of Antimony, the sublimate of Arse∣nick, &c. I answer, that such pre∣parations
are no more to be ac∣counted truly Chymicall, then the actions of an Ape are to be ac∣counted humane; for it is not every operation indifferently made that is to be accounted Chymicall: What hath the sublimation of An∣timony, Arsenick, &c. in it more then vulgar? the Arsenick is the same it was; befides in the subli∣mation of Arsenick, though it be∣come more corrosive, yet is it not more venomous, but indeed lesse; for though it kill with a lesse dose, yet not with that drought and swelling as it doth crude; which frequent sublimation will make more evident. But as I said, such operations are empirical, but not truly Chymical; which I shal there∣fore, to avoid all misunderstanding, define. Chymistry is the Art of prepa∣ring Simples, Animal, Vegetal, and Mineral, so as their crasis or vir∣tue
being sequestred from its super∣fluities, and its virulency overcome, its crudities digested, it may be an apt medicine to perform what God and nature hath granted to it, and this in reference to the healing of the infirmities of man or beast, or metals. I adde this clause of metals, because I know that it is much op∣posed by many, beleeved by few, but understood most rarely: so that I may say of this, that those only are heirs of this science, Quos me∣liore luto confinxit Jupiter &c. The prosecution of this defini∣tion will clearly illustrate the three forementioned Rules, and dissolve all the arguments and cavils of our envious adversaries; I shall therefore conclude this Proeme or Introduction herewith, intending the full discovery of our cause in our following discourse, which shall be done so plainly and clearly that
I hope all cause of reproach shall for time to come be cut off from the envious, who, like Momus, what they cannot imitate they will not fail to calumniate; from whose ob∣loquie we shall clear this Art, and make it appear to be of all hu∣mane Arts the most noble and desirable, and to mankinde most profitable.
Natures Explication, AND Helmont's Vindication. CHAP. I. That all Diseases are in their kinde curable. WEE have in our Preface touched in general the dif∣ference between a true Son of Art, and a School Doctor, which so long as we insisted in generals, could not so well be pondered, nor the difference weighed, for (In par∣ticularibus
demonstratur generalis E∣nuntiati veritas). Now we come to the thing in particular, and by it let the cause be judged, as by the other it was stated. Our work at present is to explain Nature, by which we shall easily discover which are the true witnesses of Nature, and which false, the one is a true Artist, the other a Putati∣oner. For every Artist is to be judged by his work, which is the way of judging all professions; for what∣ever is meerly notional, I account but a vain Chymera, unworthy for a se∣rious man to busie his time in lear∣ning, lest he embrace a cloud in stead of Juno. And this is the misery of our Schools and Academies, that the one teach barely words, the other bare notions, which indeed are nothing, and in application prove but empty shadowes; for he that seeks to ap∣ply
them to practise, beyond vain disputations can proceed no farther. But of this in my [Organum Philoso∣phiae] I have largely ventilated, to which I refer the Reader. It is a noble saying of Cicero, Virtutis omnis laus in actione consistit, Away with all those foolish (though specious) curiosities, by which a man is never the nearer any useful practi∣cal verity. The practical end of Theosophy is living to God, of Geometry, Ar∣chitecture, Gunnery, &c. of Arith∣metick, summing up of sums, &c. of Philosophy, Agriculture and all Mechanicks, for the use of Man∣kinde as to the conveniency of life; and Medicine, which is the last and noblest of all earthly Arts, the Phy∣sitian being, as I may say, a sccond parent to a sick man, giving him un∣der God his life sometimes, and sometimes easing him of such griefs, which though not mortal, or not
speedily, yet make the life uncom∣fortable. The nobleness of this Art may hence appear, for that all other things inasmuch as they only serve conve∣niency, yet this Art is of neces∣sity. Though Agriculture be a noble Art, so prized by the Ancients, that the inventors of each part of it were cele∣brated with divine honors, yet with∣out any Agriculture, the Indians live as long, as contented, and as healthy as any that abound with the variety of those rarities which that Art produceth and multiplieth. So Policy, Grammar, Rhetorick, &c. they do adorn, not constitute man∣kinde, they keep them in a civil de∣corum, but not in their being; for where this is wanting they live, and take a great deal of pleasure from what nature without Art affords, not grieved for the want of what they know not.
Nay rather they delight in their Barbarousness, and prefer it to the affluence of all things, and order which civilized people enjoy. I shall not need to insist in com∣paring all kinds of Arts and Scien∣ces, with this of medicine, which any man may do at his leisure, since it is plain, that skin for skin oft times a man will give for his life. No Nation, no People, no Coun∣trey without diseases and casualties, this being part of the curse; and as man at last is to return to earth whence he was taken, so he never wants the Harbingers of death, some∣time one, sometimes another sick∣nesse or casualty warning him of his mortality. So that the most savage nations are enforced to use this Art, and where∣ever it is more lamely taught and learned, the more is their misfortune; for no nation or people in which many do not often want the most
absolute helps of Nature, for want of which they oft have recourse to the Devil, to heal them of more diffi∣cult diseases, which makes Wizards and Sorcerers in great price among the barbarous people, and so much the more, by how much the Art of Medicine is less known. How great honour did the anci∣ent Grecians and Phoenicians to Aescu∣lapius, and his sons, so that they af∣ter did account them as gods, and all on the account of their dexterous science and skill in this Art. But lest I should seem to insist too long on things not to the purpose, I shall come to the matter: And first to speak of Medicine, what it is in general, and then to descend a little more particularly into the enquiry of it. Medicine is an Art by which all the defects and diseases to which mans nature is subject, are so known as to be cured and restored.
It is I say an Art of knowing, curing, and restoring all those defects which are accidental to man. Not that I do exclude other Animals, but because man is the proper subject of this Art, I do name him , or for dig∣nity sake. It includes a branch of the Art of Chymistry, which being of a larger extent, I do not yet define it by it as its genus, because that Me∣dicine is also employed about Sim∣ples, many of which are used with∣out preparation, and many are pre∣pared with preparations not proper∣ly Chymical, yet the noblest of all Medicines flow from this fountain; I therefore define it by the genus of Art, and that properly, for Art con∣tains both Theory and Practick, and the knowledge of diseases is required to their cure, as well as the prepara∣tion of Medicines, which knowledge doth help an Artist, first in choice of Medicines, and secondly in the ad∣ministration
of the same, which is more then the word Chymistry doth include. Yea whatever it is that makes to the Art of healing diseases is proper∣ly Medicinal, yea though it be mi∣raculous, yet it is the gift of healing, or medicine, or infernal and super∣stitious, it is a Satanical imposture in medicine; both which I exclude from the Art of Medicine; the one as being above Art, the other as be∣sides Art. But that I refer to this Art, which by a natural course doth perform cures, whether by Talismans, or by Sympathetical remedies, or by pro∣per Medicaments, either specifical or universal, whether simply used as Nature prepares them, or else pre∣pared by the Art of the Physician, and that either Chymically or vul∣garly. And yet Chymistry doth also comprehend the most absolute and perfect Medicaments, besides
which nothing can be desired for any disease or defect, either inward or outward, except those accidents which necessarily require the work of the hand, as Fractures, and Dislo∣cations, and pulling out of any thing violently thrust into the body, of what kinde soever it be. So then we need not any Medica∣ments which Chymistry doth not supply, yet the Art requiring the ad∣ministration as well as the prepara∣tion of the noblest Medicaments; it followes that Chymistry is too nar∣row a Genus to comprehend the whole of Medicine; which Art doth, being equally referred to Theory and Practick. And yet Chymistry is larger then to be totally comprehended by the Art of Medicine, for by it are pre∣pared Diapasmes, (which are in a sort medicinal) and sundry curiosi∣ties, some not at all referring to me∣dicine, as the making of Jemmes,
malleable glasse, &c. others are re∣ferred to Medicine, and also tran∣scend it, as the Elixir of the wise, the white respecting only riches, the red both riches and health. Yea and this supreme Medicine doth transcend the bare Art of re∣storing defects of nature; in as much as it doth lengthen life won∣derfully, although I know few do believe it. So then the Art of Medicine con∣tains these branches, first the know∣ledge of diseases, and secondly, the way of their cure. And this also contains two parts: first the choice and preparation of Medicines: and secondly, their administration. Their administration includes a true knowledge of their virtue, and so a proportionable and convenien application of them in reference to the cause of the disease and the state of the Patient. And this is universally to b
noted, that the more languid the medicines themselves are, the grea∣ter sagacity is required in the Theo∣rical part, and care joyned with dex∣terity in the practick. I know that according to the received Doctrine of the Schools, I should now unfold many very unprofitable questions, but intending the reality of things, and not respecting the empty bub∣bles of Aerial notions, I shall not meddle with them, I mean questions in reference to the definition, and di∣vision and subdivision of this Art. To proceed then to what I intend, I said that Medicine is the Art of knowing, curing and restoring all diseases and defects to which man∣kinde is subject to in reference to the body, as Theosophy doth the same in reference to the soul, so that next to it, this Art hath the first place. I express knowing, curing, and re∣storing not without cause, as I shall by and by explain. Knowing I say
because without the knowledge o diseases a man may be a Mounte∣bank, but not a Physician; which knowledge of diseases is as it were his line and plummet by which he works. By this he judges the faci∣lity or improbability of the cure, for though no disease in its kinde, ye many particular diseases are incu∣rable, as in my Preface I touched and explained, nor shall I here re∣peat. There also I did clearly discover what knowledge was absolute, and what accidental to a Physician, the one constituting, the other adorning him; the one to be required, the other to be desired in him; I shall also passe that as already spoken ful∣ly to. Curing is as much as to say, taking care of, and imploying diligence about them; nor any diligence i not enough or any care promiscu∣ously, for the nurse and cook, &c.
do carefully attend the sick party; but by cure or care, (which is all one, being but the English of the La∣ine word Cura) of the Physician is that which is intended to the recove∣ry of the Patient, and that with as much speed and safety as may be. I add restoring, as the grand mark of a real and true son of Art, it is his diploma by which he appears to be one created of God, and not by the Schools; for their creatures they adorn with titles, God graceth his with real abilities. His knowledge is not such as he sucks from the Schools, but such as is applicable to action, the other being but empty shadowes of which in its place. His cure and care is not consisting only in reiterated Visits, feeling of Pulses, and tossing of urines, Stirring of Close-stooles, and appointing Purges, Vomits, Bleeding, Fon∣sinels, Blisters, Scarifications, Lee∣ches,
and such enfeebling Martyr∣doms, nor prescribing Syrups, di∣stilled Waters of green Herbs, Lo∣zenges, Electuaries, and such foo∣leries, and what is more sordid, he doth not oversee the Kitchin, to make this Gelly, or that Broth, or this Glyster or the like, but like a valiant Achilles or Hercules, he as∣sayles the Disease with powerful and prevailing Medicines, and for the Diet he is not so precise, provided alwaies meat be not taken immode∣rately of any sort, and that diet he approves for a sick stomack which is of easiest concoction: but of this by the way, we shall insist larger on it in its place. He doth not cowardly sum up a Catalogue of incurable diseases, so that as the ignorant Academians of old had their (Graecum est, nec potes legi) so the School Doctors have a very large roll of maladies over which they only put this inscription
(Incurabilia sunt) and so leave them with a sad recommendation to God. But as the valiant Hercules fought, against Giants and Monsters and overcame them, so a true Son of Art makes it appear that all diseases are in their kinde curable. And now my Reverend Doctors, who perhaps some of you have read Galen, at least cursorily, and some have read Hippocrates, but never un∣derstood him; some have turned over Fernelius, Sennertus, Avicen and others both ancient and mo∣dern writers, to you I speak. The Art that you think your selves masters of, so that you would per∣swade your selves to be the very na∣tural Sons of Aesculapius, what is your Art? let us weigh it in the bal∣lance, let us consider it and compare it with this Art which we commend and admire; and I doubt not but as a shadow before the Sun, so your ap∣pearing Art before true Art will pass away.
Can you cure the Gout? some per∣haps of you will finde impudence enough to affirm it, to whom I shall only object, Fiat experimentum. The people deny it according to the A∣dagy, Nescit nodosam medicus curare poda∣gram. How then? You can cure you will say the running Gout, speak softly I pray, lest some of your patients hear you, and object this: And why then did you not cure me? 'Twill be a serious check. But I suppose you much mistake the name and nature of the running Gout, the Gout properly and truly is an Arthritical pain affecting the joynts immediately, and some nerves sometimes by a Deuteropatheia, and according to the situation it is called Podagra, Cheiragra, and Ischiatica▪ to these I shall adde two other spe∣cies,
to wit Cephalalgia, and Odon∣talgia, which are reall branches of the same disease: the Head-ach af∣fecting the Meninges of the brain, and the Tooth-ach the Roots of the teeth, which are in these two griefs equivalent to joynts. The Head-ach if tedious and dura∣ble is called commonly a Megrim, the Tooth-ach retains alwaies its name. Now all these kindes of griefs are either habitual or accidental, habitu∣al either hereditary, or gotten by some disorder or other. The Accidental sorts of these griefs are of their own nature transient, as having no fixed root, and are caused by unusual cold, or fals, or strokes, or strains ill healed, or dislocations ill set and restored, or fractures ill conglutinated, or else through some or other intemperance in meat or drink. For the Remedy of the Tooth-ach
if it come to extremity there is one only capital remedy of pulling them out, which oft proves but an insuffi∣cient, alwaies a lame remedy, but our age hath found the way of counter∣feiting the teeth, which makes the loss appear the less. For the Tooth-ach there are a thousand (not to say more) applications and tricks used to heat and abate the present pain, and those sometimes effectual, sometimes not at all, for they are only topical, and therefore at the best do but ease for the time; others use Spels, Charmes and Magical enchantmens for this end, and yet for all this how many thousands there are who in their youth have their Teeth most rotted out and corrupted with this grief, and all for want of help? Well and what saith the Doctor to this? In very deed he is as contem∣ptible as a Bag-piper, every old wo∣man and nurse hath as many and as good Medicines for it as he. Fie on
your worship good Doctor, with re∣verence to your gravity be it spoken, are you not ashamed of your own craft, which know not how radically to cure the Tooth-ach? You will say it is a thing too mean for your gravity, which therefore you leave to every Barber, he being the only man when all is done; for what with oyl of Cloves, Origanum, Peper, Vitriol, &c. he cannot mend, with his instrument he can end. But good Mr. Doctor, why is your worship so squeamish, and yet it is not below your worth to toss a piss-pot for a groat, and to tell the Patient a long tale of you know not what your self, when perhaps the grief is far of less concernment then the Tooth-ach? What then? Even this is the Rea∣son, here the cause is apparent, eve∣ry one knowes it as well as your self, here is no room to juggle, but you must come to action, which you
are as willing to as Hocus pocus is to act a Puppet-play with the curtain drawn open. In cases that are not evident, you can advise them to bring their water, and this you will view as a Fortune-teller the palm of ones hand, and then you have your tale as ready as a Jugler that shews his sights in Bartholomew-fair, and a Bill to the Apothecary you can give them if need be, or they desire it, or some good counsel you have in rea∣diness, which if the case were your own, you would think on it twice ere you would take it once. But in such cases which oft experience hath made as notorious to others as to you, there the Urinal must be thrown aside, and then you are at your wits ends, according to the Adagy, Stercus & urina medicorum fercula prima. How then? Marry thus, The A∣cademies
have dub'd you, and de∣clared you Doctors, which though at the first admission you know to be but a formal empty shew, yet you had the knavery to dissemble it, and the title bringing honour you are willing to accept it; and that you may not make your selves ridiculous, are apt and ready confidently to pretend what you know you have not, that is, skill. And as a lyar by oft telling a lye doth at last come almost to beleeve it himself; so at last after a long profession, you claim prescription, which that you may not expose to derision, you will un∣dertake any thing, and be as busie about any sick man as Davus in the Comedy, he shall scarse piss, but you will toss it; nor go to stool, but you will put your nose to it and stir it; nor have a mess of broth drest, but you will have a finger in its dire∣ction; and as though you scorned Nature should stand cheek by joul
with you, if the patient be sleepy (as oft times) he must be kept waking (yea and that on pain of death) Mas∣sanelloes commands right: if his sto∣mack be indifferent, he must be cur∣bed in his diet; if he be droughty and thirsty, you will forbid him drink; in a word, you are of Caesars minde in that, Aut viam inveniam, aut faciam, so you, Aut morbum in∣veniam, aut faciam. If his appetite be to any thing more then other, be sure that he must be restrained of and bound precisely to your Broths, your Julips, your Barley-waters, Gellies, &c. In a word, if the dis∣ease by too soon drawing to a pe∣riod prevent you not, you will use all the Electuaries, distilled Waters, Julips, Diet-drink, Potions, Tablets, Species, and Cordials, as you call them; all the Herbs, Flowers, Seeds, and Roots which you can probably conjecture may chance to do good, o at least you hope will do no hurt.
But if you prevail not here, then as the Poet by degrees came to his, Sicelides musae paulò majora canamus. And from them to his Arma virum{que} cano— So if your Diaeticall Cookery prevail not, as seldome it doth (though sometimes, for Reasons hereafter to be shewn) then you go a step higher, to gentle Purges and Vomits, as you call them, and if those fail, then by Issues, or Blee∣ding, or Scarification or the like: and lastly, if all fail, then you re∣solve to cure a desperate disease with a desperate medicine, singing with the Poet this Palinode. Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo. Then must poysons be used in good earnest, Helleboro purgandum Caput, is an ancient Adagy, Hellebore &
Euforbium must do what Cochipils will not: Opium must do what Let∣tice posset will not; but first it must be mixed up into a ridiculous Lauda∣num; Colocyntida & Scammony must effect what Manna, Sene & Rhubarb will not: O brave Doctors! O ca∣pita Helleboro digna! yet you are the men that cry out against poy∣sons. As though Scammony, Colocyntida, Elaterium, Esula, Euphorbium, Iala∣pium, Bryony, Asarum, Aaron, Helle∣bore, and such like, as Cambogia, &c. were not absolute Poysons. O but they are tempered by the Art of the skilful Doctor. Good words cost no money, I wish it prove so. But I pray Mr. Doctor if it be so, what means the bleating of the sheep? I mean, what is the reason your Medi∣caments retain their vomiting quali∣ty with convulsions of the stomack which have Hellebore mixed, and their purging quality with gripings
and such symptomes that have Scam∣mony mixed: thus you use to cor∣rect poysons, thus you intend to cure diseases. Minervam crassissimam! But as a Jugler when his feats are discovered, so you by this means be∣come ridiculous: you know the se∣rious check the Frog in Aesop re∣ceived, who as you do, would pre∣tend to be a Doctor, Cur tibi ipsi la∣bra livida non curas? Coughs, Colds, Murres, Hoarse∣nesses, Head-aches, Tooth-aches, and the like; nay oft-times the simple Itch and Scab, doth reproach you at home, and outdare you abroad, and what is your excuse? they are trivial cases. By which it appears, that if other diseases should become as common as these, they would all be too mean for the Doctors reverence; and good reason, because they are above his abilities. Though you name Mountebanks
with contempt, yet you differ from them chiefly herein: They pretend skill in notorious diseases, chiefly there where they are least or not at all known; You in a place where you are most known, are most desirous to deal in hidden unknown maladies. How often shall a man finde the Doctors worship himself tormented and at his wits end with the Tooth∣ach, or Head-ach, muffled up for a Hoarsness, often coughing at every breath? to whom if you object the common Proverb, Physician heal thy self, he will thank you heartily as much as if he did, but he knowes he cannot do it, but it must wear away, he will take perhaps some old wives Medicine; and what is the cause? If another come to him for the same grief, he is straight at his rules of Art, the Cough, saith he, is caused by a Catharr, and therefore first you must purge, and then make an issue, and use Conserves of Fox∣lungs
and such like remedies; why doth he not use these tricks himself? this is the reason, he knows it is a fol∣ly, for these remedies are invalid, yet be it as it will, he that hath mo∣ney, shall have his counsel which he will not take himself, because he wants some body to pay him for it, and other good he expects none, but the Patients confidence he hopes will help out the insufficiency of the Medicament, which therefore he will confidently prescribe, and count this his Counsel worth a Fee to ano∣ther, which to himself would not be worth taking. Well, be it so, that according to the Proverb, Aquila non capit mu∣scas, the Doctor is above these pet∣ty imployments, which are too vul∣gar, which might be the better be∣leeved if he were free from them himself, yet I then desire to be en∣formed, what they say to the fore∣mentioned Gout, is not that a dis∣ease
worthy their care and cure? Yes without doubt, for it is a dis∣ease that often followes great men, and Heroes, whom it so affects, that he should not be unrewarded and that highly, that could perform that, here the Doctor hath proved his skill and method (ad nauseam) and at last he concludes it to be incura∣ble. Perhaps upon some disorder of the body by sudden heat and cold, there may be caused a running and very sharp pain, which as I said be∣fore is accidental, and therefore transient; the Doctor is advised and consulted with, he adviseth fomen∣tations, unguents, plaisters, sear∣cloths and scarifications, then he purgeth the body once or again as the fansie takes him, perhaps he will cause blisters to be drawn, and after them cause issues to be made; then he prescribes a Dietory, and perhaps causeth him to sweat, the pain goeth
away sometimes, he useth bathing of the part in hot Bathes, either wet or dry; then the Doctor strokes his beard, and perswades himself he hath cured the running Gout. Ne sae∣vi magne sacerdos. Oft times a good old woman sweating a party so taken soundly with Carduus & Camomile∣flowers, & bathing the place affected with Brandy Wine warm, hath per∣formed the like: Ampla spolia! This, O this is the Doctors Me∣thod, this is the Art they so magni∣fie, in respect of which a Chymical Physician in contempt is by them termed an Emperick, and a Mounte∣bank, and what not? We have seen their mystery in common maladies, which are too vulgar for them, a gallant excuse, and in more difficult cases in which be∣ing convinced by daily experience, and opportunity of being more fully convinced, still presenting it self, hath extorted a confession of their impo∣tency
herein, yet palliated with a shameless falshood, that such dis∣eases are incurable, which censure they give on a multitude of other diseases, as the Phthisick, Consumpti∣on, Strangury, Palsie, Epilepsie, and many others, which it would be tedious to relate and name. But a true Physician acknow∣ledges none of those shameful di∣stinctions, of trivial and considerable diseases, nor that false distinction of curable and incurable; but by his Art with Gods blessing he is able to cure and restore to their integrity all distempers of what kind soever, which I shall briefly yet fully clear up and demonstrate. This task may seem to some ve∣ry difficult, especially to a Pisse-Prophet, who I suppose are very de∣sirous to hear it demonstrated. I doubt not but many of the Goosquill Tribe hope the contrary, having this confidence, that what
ever is beyond their capacity is be∣yond possibility, whom therefore I shall principally assail in this demon∣stration. If any of you desire to know how I prove all diseases to be curable, who am so confident to affirm it, I shall aske you how you prove any diseases to be incurable, which you so confidently affirm to be so. I know that what ever you will answer, though by much circumlo∣cution it will all tend to this, because you never could certainly cure such diseases, therefore you so judge them. In very truth Gentlemen, if you from negative experience are so bold to collect a positive Maxim, and confidently pronounce that incu∣rable which you cannot cure: I hope you will give the like liberty to a Son of Art, to affirm those diseases to be curable, which he hath oft and certainly restored. Worth derision was that of an
Ideot, who being asked how many seven and seven was, he counted it on his fingers and could tell the num∣ber; being asked how many four times seven was, his finger Arithme∣tick failing, he could not tell; but being asked how many seven times seven was, he said, No man could tell: he thought some men might possibly count up 4 times 7, but 7 times 7 God only knew. So you, some diseases you think you can cure; others though you cannot, yet some more experienced in your Art can, but the knotted Gout, Stone, Stran∣gury, Epilepsie, &c. God only can cure. This is your sentence; some∣things often succeed in our hands, and some, though rarely, yet some∣times, therefore they are curable; others never succeed, therefore they are incurable. This Logick would make almost all Mechanicks to be impossible, if what ever you cannot do must
straight be unfecible. Can any of you, or all your Colledge together, make the Tyrian Purple? Can you make that refined Copper which in Ezra is spoken of, and is as preci∣ous as Gold, yet both are not only fecible, but the Art was formerly known as appears by the Authority of the Scripture. But what need I propound such hard Cases to you? Can any of you make a Sword, or a pair of handsom Schooes? I hope you will not therefore conclude it im∣possible. Is all wisdom with you? Is nature limited to your knowledge? Shall that skill not be accounted true which you have not? Fie on all such arrogance, and fie on all positive con∣clusions drawn from negative expe∣rience, which is indeed but igno∣rance; for what is negative experi∣ence but want of experience, and what is that but ignorance? It is a true saying, Qui ad pauca respicit fa∣cile
pronunciat. Tell me seriously, why should you account that incura∣ble which you cannot cure? What have you tryed, for to give such a resolute sentence? Do you know all natural things, with all their pre∣parations, and the virtue of them both in their simplicity, and what they may be advanced to by a due preparation? Or do you think that this is needless for a Physician to know? Do you think that diseases will be scared into confor∣mity by the vengeance of your gra∣vity? Or what is the matter? for shame confess the truth, and say, it is a refuge only for your ignorance and laziness that you have compiled that Catalogue of incurable mala∣dies, and if you be not past all grace and shame, attend to him who of∣fers to inform you better. If the cure of the sick be your aim, and the good of mankinde, do not envie a profitable truth because it is fallen
out of your lot, which you might have shared in, had you been industri∣ous in your time and youth. But then being too slothful to learn, and now too proud to confess your igno∣rance; I cannot expect but you will be like Momi & Zoili snarling at what you cannot imitate, verifying the Adagy, Inscius quae non capit ea carpit Doctus & tanta mysteria ridet Ambo sic pergam, fatuus at unus Invidus alter. The truth is, what you affirm to be impossible that I will yeeld to be very difficult, which difficulty re∣spects not the cure, (for all diseases are alike to a noble Medicine) but the preparation of the Medicines but you know the proverb, Difficilia sunt quae pulchra. But though they be difficult, yet they are not to be despaired of, according to the Poet,
Nil tam difficile est quod non soler∣tia vincat. Do you think that Science and Art will drop down on you without pains and diligence, as Diana is fabled to have fell from Jupiter, or to be in∣spired miraculously, as Danae was fabled to be impregnated by Jupiter coming down into her lap in a showre of Gold? know you not that vendi∣dere dii sudoribus Artes? It is not reading of Aristotle that will make a Philosopher, or of Galen, Hippocrates, Avicen, Mesue, or Fer∣nelius, Sennertus or the like, that will make a Physician. It is not the rea∣ding over of Herbals, or learning the form and history of plants that will make a true Son of Art. No verily, it requires a far greater diligence. There are Medicines to be made that will cure all diseases, none excepted, which if the health of men and con∣scionable
performing of your duty were a thing you made conscience of, you would seriously attend, and not suffer so many to languish and perish hopeless, and helpless when God hath appointed means abun∣dantly for their recovery. You will say, if we could be sure that there were such remedies, we would not spare for any cost to at∣tain them, but we cannot beleeve any such thing. But why cannot we beleeve it? Doth not the Scripture say, that Gods mercy is above all his works: it is a great diffiding in Gods mer∣cy, to think that there are so many diseases left incurable, and yet this is one of Christs Attributes, that he took our infirmities and bare our griefs, he went about doing good and curing all manner of diseases among the people, therefore it is a good thing, that all diseases should be cured, and is any good thing im∣possible?
The saddest affliction of all that befals mankinde, as to this life, and the most deplorable, God hath not left without a remedy, viz. the pos∣sessing of the body by the Devil, which being a preternatural afflicti∣on, hath a supernatural remedy, which is prayer and fasting. And is it likely that he hath left any natu∣ral malady destitute of a remedy. Again, doth not the Lord pro∣test that he doth not willing grieve nor afflict the children of men, which would be a paradox to believe, if there were no remedy for such and such diseases, when the Lord by the most deplorable diseases would se set out the saddest afflicted State o the Church for their sins sake, askes this question, Is there no balm in Gi lead? is there no Physician there  it were a very unapt similitude, i there were such a catalogue of sore for which there is no balm, and suc a roll of diseases for which there i no Physician.
Tell me, did you never read of a medicine created out of earth, which he that was wise should not despise: But according to your Doctrine, if this wise man were either afflicted with the Gout, Strangury, Palsie, Epilepsie, or the like, he should de∣spise that Medicine and that justly, if it would do him no good for his distempers. It must needs follow, that that which no wise man should despise, that is, unless he would dis∣cover folly in so despising, must needs be of virtue to cure all dis∣eases or any, or else if a wise man may be subject to any disease which that Medicine could not cure, he could not without folly but despise it in reference to his own behalf. Did you never read that the sick have need of a Physician? To what end I pray thee? to entreat God for him, and to prove one of Jobs com∣forters, that is to tell him that his sickness was incurable, if then the
sick indifferently (not this sick man and that sick man excluding such and such) need a Physician, it must needs be that the Physician hath or should have remedies to help such an one, or else he hath little need of him to take his money and to tor∣ment him with his Rules of Art; which are to no purpose, if he be incurable. Did you never read that God had created the Physician for necessity, and appointed him to be honoured for necessity sake; either then such cases which you shamelesly account uncurable, are cases of necessity, and so the Physician is created of God in such cases, or no: what honour think you is Physician like to receive, that when he is called to some Patient, hath this shameful subterfuge (it is not to be done)? Nor do there want examples suf∣ficient to convince the truth of this, if you were but as careful to minde
true Artists, and to incourage them, as you are to hearken out all the va∣gabond and apostate Chymists and Empericks to make use of their igno∣rant rash adventures, to the reproa∣ching of true sons of Art. Basilius Valentinus cures are be∣yond your cavils notorious, so that he dared all the Doctors of his time to the field (as I may say) nor was he so contemptible a man, to have exposed his credit so to derision, in making such a challenge, had not his cures been notorious. Suchten, a man of no obscure fa∣mily, and Georgius Phaedro, did both promise and perform the cure of diseases counted incurable. Count Trevisan in his Treatise de Miraculo Chemico, reckons up all incurable diseases, which by his Me∣dicine he affirmed that he had cured. Paracelsus to the admiration of all Germany, did both promise and perform the like, as is beyond de∣nial
testified of him by an honoura∣ble Prince of Germany, in an honou∣ble Epitaph for that end set upon his Tomb. Quercetan after him did effect most marvellous cures by this true Art, whose testimony the quality of the man may make Authentical. Yea so far was he from studying parties, that his design was to supply the de∣fects of Art in the common Apo∣thecaries shops, which he endevour∣ed in his Pharmacopoea Dogmatico∣rum restituta, in which he did (ex ungue Leonem) by those commoner things of Chymistry, yet far sur∣passing the ordinary drugs, do what he could to incite those who were diligent and judicious to a more serious search after secrets, which be∣cause he would not prostitute, he declared covertly, yet neverthe∣less to a son of Aat plain enough. And in our Age the noble Hel∣mont did perform the same to ad∣miration,
and hath so satisfactorily written of the whole Art in his large volume every where extant, that though many snarl and bark at him, yet hitherto none hath appear∣ed that durst take up the buckler against him. What can you say to these men good Mr. Doctors, are their testimo∣nies true or no? I suppose this que∣stion will prove to you as Christs in the like case did to the Pharisees and Scribes, concerning the Baptism of John, when he asked them if it were of heaven, or of men. If you confess it to be true, then I aske you why you do not follow them, why do you not beleeve them, why do you reproach the Art so signally testifi∣ed? If you say it is not true, the people will condemn you, your own Chieftains will convince you, Senner∣tus, Fernelius, and many others have been forced to confess that of this Art in its commendation, which
would make your ears glow to hear it in English. And to deal in good sadness, How come you to know any thing concer∣ning the Art of Medicine? Have you it not from testimony? Are not Authors authorities your main pil∣lars? suppose your selves to be as you were before you had any pra∣ctise, yet you were dub'd Doctors; and what was all your skill then but on credit? are not the Herbals but so many collections of the Judge∣ments of such Authors as have writ∣ten on the subject? And are the opi∣nions of some men that you fancy, to be believed before the absolute testi∣mony of others? What partiality is this? What had Galen to induce cre∣dit more then Paracelsus, Helmont, Count Trevisan, Valentinus, Querce∣tan, and those of his Art, whose per∣sons were noble, whose learning not contemptible, and who wrote not their placits, but their experiences;
not what they thought, but what they had done, and could do. Is a negati∣on to be accounted as an oracle be∣fore a positive affirmation? Away with this madness! If you would de∣sire a reason for the curableness of all diseases, I answer, the effect is to be the proof of the cause: I suppose you are so good Logicians as to know that cause and effect do mutu∣ally argue each other. If then all diseases in kinde have been, are, and may be cured, then they are curable. The assumption is proved by testi∣monies sufficient, by experience, and no obscure grounds from the Scri∣pture.
CHAP. II. The insufficiency of vulgar Medicines is the cause why many Diseases are judged incurable. BY the Catalogue of incurable Diseases it may appear what and how many diseases there be which the Doctor confesseth are without the reach of his medicines and me∣thod. We shall take them at their word, who grant indeed that they cannot cure them, but that they are not therefore cureable, that we have upon good ground denied. Now let us consider the efficacy of their method and medicines in other cases, which they do account curable, and examine what they do perform there. But first I shall adde a word or two of serious reproof to them in refe∣rence
to the former number of incu∣rable maladies, in that they to me seem not a little culpable. If they would candidly wave the cure of such griefs, and deal ingenu∣ously with the fick Patient, it were commendable in them as honesty, al∣though they should much diminish their reputation thereby. But yet though they (I mean the ablest of the sect) do confesse their unsufficiency to cure such and such maladies, yet this notwithstanding, if any through ignorance of their abilities come to them, in any such case, they will not turn him away; ve∣rifying therein the sordid saying of an unworthy Emperor, Dulcis door lucri ex re qualibet. And yet for this they want not a shift, and a poor one too, Although say they we know not certainly to cure it, yet we know the causes of it, what breeds it, and what feeds it, these we cannot totally remove, but
we can so diminish bad humors which is as fuel to it, that it shall not be so dangerous, nor so troublesom as else it would be, also we can apply reme∣dies to abate Symptomes, and this Art will do. These are good words, which if they knew not how to give, it is pi∣ty but they had been turned to plough when they had been first sent to the School. But as good words alone will never satisfie a hungry belly, so will it less profit in so difficult a case. What our Doctors can do in aba∣ting the Symptomes of the Gout, the Stone, the Epilepsie, the Palsie, I desire to know and learn, nay in a less case then those mentioned, in the Quartan Feaver. I confess, that in the time of mise∣ry the Patient oft times will admit of any help real or only promised, ac∣cording to that old saying, A drown∣ing man will catch at a straw. But
the Doctors ready affording to them their help and counsel when called, in such and other the like cases, and performing nothing in lieu of great fees, doth make them justly at last ridiculous, so that the name of a Do∣ctor is as contemptible to many of the most vulgar, as a Puppet-player; and justly, for who sees not how sor∣didly in these cases he behaves him∣self? Let a poor man be taken Para∣lytical, or Epileptical, or Leprous, or with a Cancer, Lupus, or the like, they will very friendly advise them not to spend their money, for it is in vain; nay Hospitals are not to en∣tertain such persons as being out of hope of cure; and yet if a great He∣roe be taken with any of the like cases, no Ravens will flie more gree∣dily to carrion then they to him, in this acting very impudently and dis∣honestly. It is not my purpose here to de∣scend to the particulars of diseases,
this being only an Apology, I ha∣ing elsewhere largely insisted upon many diseases in particular, such to wit which are more common and truculent, which I did, that ingeni∣ous men which have not the happi∣ness to attain to the greater arca∣naes, may yet have a Succedaneum to them, which being of a more pre∣cise nature, are to be used in some cases only, not so commonly, and universally in all. To return therefore to the thing proposed, namely to consider and take a view of the Doctors perfor∣mances in other cases which they count curable, namely Feavers, Fluxes, Pleurisies, &c. And first to begin with the Fea∣ver; is that I pray you certainly by you cured? No verily, nay the con∣trary. Truth, there are very great varieties of Feavers, some are diary, and of their own accord end in a fit for the most part, here perhaps
the Doctor is called, and prescribes a ridiculous medicine with a severe diet, and the party recovers of the disease, which of its own accord would have ceased, or at most na∣ture being holpen by a Sage or a Car∣duus posset, and sweat provoked thereby. The cause of these Feavers being a light error in the first digestion, and not affecting the spermatical mem∣brane of the stomack with any ma∣lignant impression, is easily avoided by one, and that oft no tedious fit, and not rarely is expelled by vomit, and loosness, but most often by sweat. When the Doctor comes to such a Patient, finding him very ill at stomack, restless, and oft with much pain in the head, very thirsty, and with a thick pulse, he for the time appoints him some cooling Julip, and perhaps some simple Cordial, and by this means hindering natures indi∣cation,
the party who after a sound sweat would the next day be pretty well, is like a sea-sick man, though the rigor of the former day be aba∣ted, yet he is untoward, with a de∣jected appetite, and somewhat Fea∣verish; then the Doctor prescribes a purge, to carry away (as he saith) the peccant matter, and in a word handles the case so artificially, that he will make a fortnights cure of it, sometimes twice as long. This then he accounts a great cure, and to make it the more esteemed, he will make it costly enough, the Apo∣thecaries Bils oft times in such cases rising to five, sometimes to ten pounds, and the Doctors Fees to as much, when as the disease at the first taking in hand was but a plain Dia∣ry, though before the Doctors ma∣king an end, it be by his rules of Art changed into a Synochus. Nor may this seem a false imputa∣tion, for I have known the like done
where no Feaver hath been before, yet the Doctor by his Art of pre∣venting diseases, hath not only cau∣sed disease, but also promoted it so far, that by it all future maladies have been certainly prevented, and the grave hath covered his error. A Gentleman of my acquaintance in London, some three years past, in the Autumn, was asking me what I would advise him for the purging of his body to prevent diseases, (ma∣lignant Feavers being thn com∣mon) I demanded of him what mo∣ved him to desire Physick; he told me indeed he found no disorder in his body, but thought it were good to use Physick notwithstanding for revention sake. I told him that Christs rule therein was not to be ontemned, viz. That the whole eed not a Physician, but such who re sick; and advised him if he were well, to keep himself well; but he would needs take the advise of a
Doctor, and some gentle thing to cleanse his body, hoping by it to be the less subject to the disease of the time. He advised with one, without ex∣ception of as great fame and note as any in London, who hath heaped up riches out of the ruines of several persons and families, and for doing it with a grace, hath with them got∣ten a name: he adviseth him to a gentle Purge, which being taken, wrought little or not at all; where∣upon the next day finding himself little the better, the Doctor prescri∣bed him a Purge somewhat stron∣ger; for, said he, the humor is me∣lancholick, and so not easily remo∣ved: this purge wrought throughly so that at night he had little rest, and the next day was Feaverish, which the Doctor handled so well, that i ten daies he rid him both of his Fea∣ver and his life.
Another Doctor of no less note, about two years since, came to a Gentlewoman of good quality, who had sormerly been his Patient, and was at that time in good health, on∣ly desirous for prevention sake to purge, which he directed her to do, prescribing a Purge, which working not at all, he advised another of grea∣ter force; this wrought about 16 or 20 stools, and in the night began to work afresh, nor ceased (the Do∣ctors skill notwithstanding) till in three daies it fully cured her of all infirmities present and to come. No marvel then since they are so dextrous in causing diseases where none were, and managing them till by them is made an end of all world∣ly miseries, if they being called to a diary can artificially turn it into a Synochus, according to the Adagy, Facilius inventis additur, quàm uova inveniuntur.
If I were minded here to insist on instances, I might spend more time then this Apology will admit; I shall therefore pass on to the matter in hand, namely that the Doctor with all his medicaments which the Apo∣thecaries shops afford, and his so much adored method to boot, is not confident of the cure of any one dis∣ease, nor can be assure his Patient thereof. So then if there be any acciden∣tall distemper befallen a strong man, or woman, there he will tamper like a tinker, who seldome mends a hole till he makes it twice or thrice as big, that so he may account so ma∣ny the more nailes; so the Doctor will not spare to play booty between Nature and the disease, till it be ag∣gravated to what height it is possible for nature to bear, and then he with∣drawes his hand, and expects the Critical day, to wit, to see what end nature will make, in the mean time
to the disturbance of her as much as he can, he forbids all meat and drink but his cookery, every day peeping in the urinal, and feeling the pulse, and prescribing this or that slop for a Cordial; if the Patient die, then he takes himself excused, for he proceeded according to the Rules of Art, if he recover (as God in mercy doth recover many, though far less then otherwise through the Doctors help) then he reckons this for a cure, and prides himself here∣in, whose folly we shall discover ful∣ly to the Impartial Reader. 'Tis a shameful excuse that Do∣ctors usually make when many die under their hands, that they pro∣ceed according to the Rules of Art, if this Art be worse then the Art of a Tinker or a Cobler: For let any of these be called to do any job of work that is in their Trade, they will tell you straight, if or no it be to be done, and undertaking will per∣form
it, only the Doctor if called to a sick patient, will in lieu of a large Fee tell you what the disease is (at least what comes into his minde at the time, which he thinks will satisfie an ignorant patient) and what is this? The sick man needs a Physician, not a witness of his misery. Well, aske him concerning the cure, he will tell you that he can promise nothing, for the blessing is only in Gods hand, but he will do his endevour. A re∣ligious Answer, and as he will gar∣nish it, to the vulgar specious, but it is is but a visard to hide a grievous imposture. For as our life, so all our actions are in the hand of God; 'tis he that buildeth the house, else in vain is the work of the workman. The hus∣band-mans breaking up his ground, sowing his seed, and managing his ground: even this saith the Pro∣phet) is of the Lord; He teacheth him, and helpeth him, else he could
do nothing. So in God we live, move, and have our being: and when we speak of ordinary natural things, to be so cautious in speaking as not to promise any thing without mentioning God, is not discommen∣dable, but the contrary; yet as it may be used, or rather misused, this may seem not only ridiculous, but in a manner an affected taking Gods name in vain: as for instance, if a man being desired to make a gar∣ment, should promise not absolutely, but with proviso, if God permit, and give life, it is Christian-like; but if he desire Gods blessing as to the effect, the causes being granted, that is ridiculous; as if he should say, I cannot promise to make you a gar∣ment, but I wil use all the skill I have and my endevours, but it is in Gods hand whether it shall become a garment or no. So if a servant should be bidden to kindle a fire, should say he could not promise to
do that, but he would do his en∣devour, but Gods blessing must give the success; how ridiculous were this? but much more if for fuel he should take stones, and for fire some∣thing of a different nature, and ex∣cuse himself, as having done what was on his part, but Gods blessing not concurring, the effect did not suc∣ceed according to desire. Not unlike is it in this case: a Doctor is called to a Patient taken with a Feaver, and first orders him to be let bloud, then purged either upward or downward, or both waies; the disease yet encreasing he gives his cooling Julips, pectoral Electua∣ries, Conserves and Syrups, withall he prescribes Clysters, or Suppo∣siters, Lotions for the mouth, and such fooleries; if notwithstanding the disease continue, and grow more violent, he then expects the crisis of Nature, only he will perhaps apply pigeons or the like to the feet, or
vesicate the external members for re∣vulsion sake, and yet if the Patient die, he holds himself excused, as ha∣ving followed the rules of Art, and done what was to be done, only the success, as he saith, being in Gods hand, he therefore could not help it, if God did not see good to make the medicines applyed, effectual for the mans recovery. But as it is a sad thing that the grace of God pretended, should be used as a pander unto wantonness, so it is no less hateful, that the provi∣dence of God should be misapplied as a cover-slut of idleness, ignorance, and unconscionableness: for who knowes not that our life is so in Gods hand, as it is ordinarily pre∣served or lost by the use or want of things proper thereto? even hunger it self would be certainly mortal, if not appeased by meat appropriated thereto by the appointment of God. And if stones were used for food, no
man would doubt to impute death in that case to the want of food, as the immediate cause subordinate to the providence of God: so is it in this case. And in truth God can, but rarely doth work miracles; a man rarely is starved to death amidst va∣riety of victuals, nor pined for thirst where drink is plenty, much less where he both may, and doth eat and drink at pleasure. So then as to the starving of a man is required want of meat & drink, or either of them, so to the perishing of a man under a Feaver is required the defect of a true medi∣cine, or want of timely application. It is not every ridiculous slop that is a Medicine, nor any promiscuous care of the sick that is the true Art of cure; that is a Medicine indeed, and the Art of cure indeed, which hath a power to perform what the Physician promiseth, or the Pati∣ent expecteth. So then the Art and Medicines which are required for
cure, and not for pretence, are to be related unto actual recovery as a suffi∣cient cause to the effect, which is cer∣tainly effectual. 'Tis as naturall and certain for a right Medicine to cure a disease, as it is for fire to inflame combustible things, for the Sun to give light, for water to quench fire, and the con∣trary would be supernatural, yea I am bold to affirm, that it would be as strange for a true Medicine rightly applyed to miss the cure of a na∣tural disease, as for the flame not to consume a combustible object. So that for Doctors to pretend that they use the means, and that ac∣cording to the rules of Art, but Gods blessing not concurring, the effect did not answer expectation; is as much as if they should say, that God to render their labour and care fru∣strate, doth work miracles daily, in denying the natural effect to an ade∣quate cause.
And if so, they may justly fear themselves to be highly out of Gods favour, if he will cross and pervert the ordinary course of nature, and that daily and commonly to fru∣strate their endevours; or else they must confess the truth as it is name∣ly, that their method and medicines are not to be esteemed as an ade∣quate cause to the effect of cure of diseases; and then what is their Art, but a shameful imposture and cheat of the world? I would gladly any of the Galeni∣cal Tribe would salve this Argu∣ment, by resolving the world to what diseases their Art, Method, and Me∣dicaments, are adequated causes in re∣spect of cure and reference to reco∣very, if to any, then in such diseases they may as confidently warrant the effect, as a Gunner to fire a Gun that is charged with good powder, and he with a lighted linstock in his hand; nor is it presumption in the
one more then in the other, but alas is it not evident, that if a Doctor be called to a sick man, though at the beginning of the disease, and in his full strength, yet he can promise no∣thing but to do his endevour, as the man doth who according to the Proverb, thresheth in his cloak? whence it appears, that when ever any one recovers he doth it only through Natures benignity, and not by any art of the Doctor, who could not warrant the cure, much less how soon it would be effected. Fie on that Art, which alone of all Arts in the world can not, dare not, will not warrant to perform what it undertakes, when as the most hazar∣dable Art of all Agriculture, and the Mariners Art, are usually warranted, yet we know that the winds which are the directors and accomplishers un∣der God of the Mariners design, blow where they list, rarely trade, and the crop of the husbandman (if the
early and latter rains do but fail, ei∣ther impared, or else quite frustrated, yet both one and the other are war∣ranted by the undertakers, on penalty of loss of all their labour and cost, at the least, and oft times a voyage by Sea is warranted by Merchants for a small inconsiderable gain to be paid to them at adventure, in lieu of which they will repay the whole if lost, on∣ly the Doctor is of another minde, for he will be paid at adventure, nor will he warrant any thing in lieu of his payment, but to do his ende∣vour, which is a ridiculous cheat of the sick, both of their money and lives. If a Taylor when cloath is brought him, should demand, pay at a ven∣ture, and yet not promise to perform his work, but only to do his ende∣vour, even the Doctor himself would think him as well deserving his wages, as they in Lubberland de∣serve twelve pence by the day for
sleeping, but especially if such a Taylor should spoyl the cloth so brought him by cutting it into shreds, in stead of making it into a garment, and do thus ten times for once making a garment, and yet exact his pay, how like a knave would this acting be, and yet how like a Doctor, who never doth otherwise. Contrariwise a Son of Art, he confidently undertaketh a disease and as certainly performes what he un∣dertaketh; he comes armed with powerful Medicaments, and not with a simple impotent method, which are as effectual to the person that is sick for his recovery, as water would be for the quenching of fire; not that he attempts any thing without the blessing of God, for he acknow∣ledgeth it a great mercy of him, first to have provided such Medicines in Nature for such maladies, and se∣condly, in revealing them to him for the help of mankinde: and lastly, in
bringing him to those who finde help by him, for otherwise where God intends a disease shall be fatal to any, he with-holds the means from him, either totally, or so long till it be too late to recover him. For although the consequent which is drawn from the cause to the effect be certain and undeniable, yet the cause may accidentally be frustrated of its effect, by accident, yet so that the cause doth not cease to be a cause notwithstanding. I might in∣stance in all generations, which by accident may be hindred: the fire may not burn what is combustible, if by accident that be made too wet; so water will not quench fire, if the quantity be too little; so a man can∣not be cured by a medicine, if already death be possest of the principal parts, or if the party be not sensible and so will not take it, otherwise it cannot be but that a medicine indeed must work its effect, else it is no Me∣dicine.
But here it will not be amiss to an∣swer a cavil, I doubt not but some adversaries will object to me as of old was objected to Paracelsus: Do you cure all? Do none die of your Patients? To these I shall answer, that indeed all do not recover, and yet the truth of what I say nothing infringed; for against all diseases there is a remedy, but against death none, that only is out of the reach of all medicines. Now if God hath numbred a mans daies, and finished them, it is not to be objected to the disgrace of a Medicine, that it can∣not prevail against the irerecovera∣ble decree. If that were all that were to be objected against the Galenists me∣thod and practise, we should never finde fault with them; for it is ap∣pointed to all men once to die, and all our daies are numbred, every man is not to live ad aetatem decre∣itam.
But with all this we say, that though our Medicines cannot triumph over death; yet against the miseries of life. They will prevail over the dis∣ease even there where recovery of life is impossible: and therefore a true febrifuge will refresh, abate Symptomes, compose, and bring to quiet, even there where the seat of life is possessed by death, which is a (levamen) though not a (restaura∣tio). Sometimes the stroke of death de∣ludes with the face of a disease, at least shewing some of the common usual symptomes of a Feaver, not easily to be discerned, and that be∣cause it is as we say (preter spem) Not hoped for, and so not so easily beleeved according to the Adagy, (Facile speramus quae fieri volumus, facilius quod speramus credimus).
And so on the other hand what a man would not have, he is not apt to believe. Adde to this the com∣miseration we have to those that are afflicted and in sickness, which would make us desire to be instrumental in any thing which is for their reco∣very. And lastly, if a man do doubt the worst, yet it is not good to af∣fright the Patient with his jealousies, which leave a deep impression on his spirit, and make the hope (if any were) oft times desperate. To con∣clude, as nothing is without a cause, and therefore diseases are curable because Medicines are endowed by God with such a virtue, so that some particular diseases are excepted from the rule of the generals there are par∣ticular causes, of which it is most true, Faelix qui poterit rerum dignoscere causas.
Yet a Son of Art by his Medi∣cines is able to cure what is curable, (which all diseases are in their kinde) though sometimes the disease being heightned almost to its utmost pe∣riod before he is called, so that death having conquered the chief places, will not accept of any truce; sometimes the party is struck with deaths stroke at first, which causing a commotion of the Archeus, dis∣daning to be so overmastered by its adversary, doth appear like unto an ordinary acute disease, yet without possibility of cure, unless by his pow∣er who can raise the dead; some∣times the patient hath undergone so much of the Galenical Tribes metho∣dical Butchery, that he hath not strength left to help the Physicians Medicines, nature having been so exhausted, that for want of strength it faints under its load; nor hath it strength sufficient left to co-work with the Medicine, and sometimes
the defect of the highest Arcana, which every true son of Art cannot command, doth make many here∣ditary diseases, and some chronical, which are raised to a more then usu∣al height, to be out of his Medica∣ments reach, which otherwise would be cured by a powerful Arcanum. And here is the goodness of the most High, that no man can truly boast himself to be a real son of Art, but he hath at command Medicines to cure the most common and trucu∣lent diseases, as for instance, Feavers, Pleurisies, Flixes of all sort, Agues of all sort, small Pox and Measles which are indeed but a branch of Feavers, Calentures, also which be∣long to the same head, the Jaundies, Head-aches, Tooth-aches, with all running pains, Hypochondriacal Co∣licks, affections of the Mother, and obstructions of all sorts cau∣sing indigestion, Palpitations, Syn∣copes, Convulsions, Vertigoes, &c. which a true son of art can confident∣ly
undertake and cure: and though some are past recovery of life as is before said, yet even to such his Me∣dicaments will be effectual for ease and comfort, and abating of raging Symptomes, which is an effect not to be despised, where more cannot be attained. That therefore may well and tru∣ly be account a Febrifuge, which or∣dinarily, speedily and powerfully cures Feavers of all sorts, at first or second dose oft times, but never ex∣ceeds four daies in continual Feavers, if administred in the beginning, and Agues oft at one fit, never misseth in three or four at most, perfectly to cure: and although some Feavers which have been neglected too long ere remedy be sought, do miscarry, yet of such not one of five, of those that are taken in time not one in a hundred, which doth not disprove the virtue or efficacy of the medi∣cine.
I know what will be said in calum∣ny against me, though not in answer to me, namely, that I am an Empe∣rick, and by an Emperick they usu∣ally would have understood, one who practiseth by fortuitous receipts, without the knowledge of the cause of the disease, or nature of what he administers, and therefore shoots his shafts at randome. This hath been an old reproach of Paracelsus, Helmont, Quercetan, and all Chymical Physicians, and there∣fore I shall not wonder if it be cast upon me. But as a worthy friend of mine, when a great Doctor of the Ga∣lenical Tribe, very passionately re∣proached me to him as an Emperick, and Mountebank, asked him the dif∣ference between such a one and a dub'd Doctor? The Galenist answe∣red, the one shot at random, the other wrought according to Art and Method: to which my friend replyed that to his knowledge I cured not on∣ly
speedily, but certainly, and con∣stantly, those diseases (namely A∣gues) which the other Doctors al∣waies failed in curing, now if this were the difference between an Em∣perick and a Colleague of the Col∣ledge, that the first at randome (as he objected) never or very seldom missed, but such as himself by Art never or very seldom hit the cure, he had rather have an Empirical cer∣tain constant and safe cure, then an artificial missing of the same. It is known to the most vulgar and ignorant, that not only Chronical diseases are out of the Doctors reach, but all acute diseases also, which na∣ture doth not of his own accord cure, which may appear by the effect; How many Feavers do they cure? certainly none, if we judge that for a cure which is indeed so to be judged, where the Crisis is prevented by the efficacy of the Medicine; but how many in a year out live the Cri∣sis
many daies through the strength of Nature, and yet die meerly through the Doctors taking part against nature by phlebotomy, pur∣ging, &c. who is hired by the pa∣tient to oppose the disease, against which their Medicines are as effectu∣all as the Priests holy-water is against the Devil, or the ringing of Bels, and mumbling a Pater-noster on their heads; to both of whom I may say that of the Satyrist, Ah pecus insipidum, nullo non scom∣mate dignum! Siccine vos decuit fieri ludibria vulgi? I have oft seriously wondred how it should come to pass that these silly Juglers should so long shuffle out, since there is scarce one in the whole Nation that ever made use of them, who in health hath not a flout ready in his bag to throw in a Galenists dish, and yet in sickness they deifie in a manner those very men whom
in health they scorned: and I can∣not but ascribe it to the justice and wisdom of God, who is pouring forth his plagues all the world over (I mean among Christians) by which the third part of the world shall pe∣rish, and I think in my conscience, that few less perish by the Doctors craft. 'Tis a sad consideration, that Christians only swarm with these Caterpillars, the Heathens not know∣ing, nor owning nor following their method; witness the Turks, Moores, &c. And then began it to grow to this head of esteem, when the aposta∣cy of Christians provoked God to the pouring forth of his plagues, of which the most truculent of all, is the Doctors Art. The sword and all diseases put together destroy not so many as they, namely such as by Natures strength would recover, but are destroyed by the Doctors Art. Without these the Romans flourished 500 years, nor found any
want of them. Now Italy and Rome swarmes with them, and never did diseases raign there as now; and of all places where are the yearly bu∣rials comparable to those places where Doctors are most numerous? How do they swarm in London? and yet not a year in which many thou∣sands dye not of curable diseases. 'Tis sad it should be so, and yet who sees it not? Let a disease be but epi∣demical, the Doctor cals it a new disease, although no other then an epidemical Feaver, and here he is the by-word of every water bearer. In Agues, especially Autumnal and po∣pular, who more ridiculous, and yet the people though they see and know this, nevertheless submit to them, and adore them in necessity, to the cheating them of their money, and the loss of their lives. By all which it is most most evi∣dent that their Medicines are but ri∣diculous, so named, a medendo, as
Lucus a lucendo (quod minimè mede∣antur) which may scarcely pass as metaphors to true Medicines, nor can any good be predicated of them without an Irony. If we should take a particular sur∣vey of all their Medicines, we shall finde them all partly ridiculous, and partly desperate, universally answer∣ing to their denomination; as the rude painters draughts of old did the things they represented, under which if it were not written, this is a Dog, this is a Cow, this is a Stag, this a Man, this a Cock, &c. no man by the draught could tell what the pi∣cture represented; so if those were not called Medicines, a man should never by the effect know that they were so. First, are their Cathar∣ticks and Emeticks, next their Dia∣phoreticks, then their Diureticks, then their Carminatives, and next their Cordials, which are either Hypnotick, or Pectoral, or Bezoar∣dical,
or cooling. These are indeed magnificent names, let the things be what they will. And here I cannot but take notice of their artificial im∣position of names, in that they call their laxative Medicines which are of milder operation Lenitives, those of stronger , Catharticks, which is usually rendred in other tongues, verbatim, purgatio in La∣tine, a purge in English, as of old the Romans called an enemy Peregrinus, that is, a stranger, Urbanitate seu le∣nitate nominis rei atrocitatem sive odium mitigante, as Cicero hath it, so they, by sugred denominations would hide the malignity of the things so denominated, according to the Adagy, A man that hath a bad name is half hanged, & on the contra∣ry he that hath a good name may lie a bed till noon, intimating the levity of the vulgar, who will easily be indu∣ced to embrace a promising name, both for name and thing also.
Now of this sort some work pre∣cisely one way, others work both waies, both upward and downward; of the latter sort are, Elaterium Cam∣bogia, otherwise called Gutta, Gum∣mi, Centian, Housleck, and many others; of the first sort, are Rhu∣barb, Scammony, Colocynthis, Ja∣lapium, &c. Vomitories, because they hear but ill in English, they likewise call by a Greek name Emeticks, which the common sort not so well under∣standing, do think that in the name some reverend mystery is contained; and truly so there is, for as a Thief, or Seminary (with us) to avoid ta∣king, hath a new name for a refuge, so these having deserved but ill un∣der the name of Vomits, be chan∣ged into Emeticks, and will get en∣tertainment under that name, which would be abhorred under their own denomination. So that if a Patient say, Oh good
Doctor give me not a Vomit, for such a time I took one which had nigh killed me; no saith he straight, I will only give you an Emetick out not a Vomit: if the party reply, And what do you call an Emetick? saith he, a Medicine that worketh very gently, perhaps once or twice if need be, and thus the Patient accepts of an Emetick who abhorred a Vomit. And the like cause gave Scammo∣ny, Colocynthida and Combogia, the surnames of Diagridium, Alahandal, and Gutta Gummi, as having by their churlishness deserved ill so of∣ten, that they are ashamed of them. So Succus cucumeris agrest is, is sur∣named Elaterium. But to leave the names, and come to the thing, what are all these Me∣dicaments but poysons? if any be desirous to make experiment, let it be on himself first or none, let him I say but treble the Doctors Dose to himself, and I dare almost warrant him death.
But you will say they are corre∣cted by the Apothecaries Art ac∣cording to the Doctors prescription, if so, let the effect speak. The wilde Cucumer is to be sliced with a bone knife when green, and the juyce to be received in a clean platter, which precipitates a light sedimen, this is to be severed from the other juice by decantation and dry∣ed, which is their Eleaterium, and is then fit to enter their compositi∣ons. Can any thing be more ridi∣culous? in the juyce indeed is the whole virtue or Crasis, and the most eminent in that part which stils out of it self from the Apple being cut in slices by degrees over a dish, so far they are right: so Opium is the best which distils out from the scape of the Poppy so wounded, and may resemble the bloud of the vegeta∣ble. But why the juyce when clarified (by precipitating the powder that is
light and feculent) should be cast away, and the dregs (themselves call it a fecula) be only saved, I see no rea∣son, but because the true sincere juice would be too strong, a gallant correction. So Hellebore, Hyoscyam, Aconitum, and all may be corrected, if being stamped green, and strained, and then filtred, that only be saved which remains behinde in the filtring bag, or if dry, macerated by decocti∣on, and then strained and filtred, and the light fecula saved. The gross apple is rejected, as being too gross a feces, the subtle juyce also, as being too efficacious a poyson, only the light fecula (which being not washed retains a little of the virtue of the juice) is saved, and it is a proper corrected Medicine for a Ga∣lenist, and yet of this half a scruple would be as effectual as a two penny halter. But why sliced with a bone knife? It is a good proviso for the Apothe∣caries
Wife, and younger Apprentice, the one a weak woman, the other a knavish boy, very apt both to cut their fingers, and the Doctor not knowing what work the juice of these Cucumers would make in a cut finger, provides for them as a nurse for a childe with a bone knife. So Colocyntida is corrected by hang∣ing two years or three in the air on a string. If loss of virtue may be called correction, I am sure Tobacco that is of as strong a composition as Colocyntida, by the same Art may may be corrected firly for the dung hill, which before was of value; so Colocyntida, Briony, Hellebore, A∣sarum Roots, Aconitum, Aaron, &c. by this Art become fit drugs for a Galenist, because scarce fit for ough else but the dunghill. As for the confection of poyson in Receipts, because many simpl people believe, that this composition of the Apothecaries by the Doctor
direction is a correction of venomes, so as to alter their name and na∣ture into medicine, it is a meer de∣ceit; for they only compound them with hony or sugar, and confound them with other things in such a proportion, that a dose shall comain of the poyson a less quantity then may prove mortal, which they might as well administer alone, nor with so much pains confound those things in composition which are of themselves of little or no virtue. Thus Opium is confounded with a many Simples into a ridiculous La∣danum, of which let be given as much as doth contain 6 grains of the Opium, and see if the effect be not the same or worse then if so much crude Opium were given. These tricks then are but toyes bare∣ly to confound Simples by beating them together with honey or sugar, into an Electuary or a Confection, without previous preparation and
separation of the good from the bad. Medicine is a serious, and hidden thing, I had almost said sacred, nor doth it come to the knowledge of any, but by the special gift of the most high. It is he that hath crea∣ted the Physician and hath set him up to be honoured for necessity sake. Nor is it to be thought that the ab∣struse mysteries of this Art lye pro∣stituted in every Apothecaries shop, according to the Adagy, Vix gemmae in trivio. Those who were the first Heroes of this Art, did hide the secrets of it so from the conusance of the vulgar, that they had a Divinity ascribed unto themselves in reference to their hidden and secret skill; only Galen to get a name, made a great noyse about the world, taking upon him to unveil Medicine, and expose
her naked to the eye of the most un∣worthily sordid, covetous practitio∣ner of the Art: but as he who did but dare to gaze upon Diana naked, was crowned with horns, and made a prey unto his dogs; so he who as∣sayed such violence to this chaste and most retired Nymph, is worthily rewarded with Midas purchase, viz. a pair of Asses ears. Those who know and see, how studiously any of their own sect doth hide any one Receipt or Medicine which the finde singular, so that many of them have never revealed it dying, who would imagine them to be such Animals, that whatever they read they should straight believe (provided the Author have but had the luck to die famous) and straight∣way to draw it into their Dispensato∣ry, to be put in practise by the Apo∣thecary. As though many who do write, (aiming at pomp and ap∣plause) do not write meerly con∣jectures
which they account ratio∣nal. Adde to this Natures simplicity, which doth that with one or two things duly prepared and applyed, which would not be done by all the Doctors pompous receipts, which by hap some or other lighting of ei∣ther by conference with some good old woman, or having by fuccess found the reality of the thing, which the Doctor willing to advance by his method of extracting, candying, or conserving, or compounding; he finds it to answer his expectation worse in composition, then in its sim∣plicity, with a due preparation, which therefore he keeps to himself as a secret, and perhaps gets much credit by it, (for that is the Doctors craft, that what a good old woman shall do by natures simplicity, shall be judged not worth thanks, yet the same done by him shall be enhanced within a degree of a miracle) two
or three such trivial experiments, yet more effectual then the ordinary slops perhaps he accounts his myste∣ry, which he will not discover, till at last dying he is won to impart them to the world, which he knowing to be so simple, that if told sincerely, would be received with this of the Poet, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici? He therefore garnishes out the naked simple truth with addition of many things, which he hopes or thinks will be but as herb John in Pottage, of which some by reason of their dearness, some for the hardness of procurement may raise a reverend esteem of that secret so much estee∣med in his life, and which he fears (if nakedly declared) would be con∣temptible after death: and thus what to him was effectual, being by his direction clog'd and perverted
with a fortuitous medley, becomes frustrate; hence it is that so many things which were famous to the Inventor, are at this day but con∣temptible slops. Thus the Countess of Kents Pow∣der is since her death brought into usual receipts, which I rather sup∣pose is a spurious Receipt forged by others, then left by her; yet in that she wanted not her costly additions, which added to the price, but dimi∣nished the virtue of the Simples: the like may be said of Gascoines Pow∣der, which is by some accounted the ground of the other. But what I particularise these things for I do to this end, that it may appear how sottishly Doctors take for granted what ever they read in a book written by any man who was famous in his life, which must needs be believed, and taken thus on credit, is so transmitted unto the Apothecaries to be accordingly pre∣pared,
when as their secrets which they so esteemed, they concealed in their life what they could, and might have many reasons not to leave can∣didly written after death. Partly lest the naked simplicity of them should bring them into contempt, but it may be chiefly because per∣haps to some friends under colour of friendship they have enviously given wrong Receipts, which they must not alter at death lest they should brand themselves with a black note of in∣famy by so doing, or for other rea∣sons, which it is not my design to reckon up or to endevour to conje∣cture; only the grand reason I doubt not, is because when a Doctor gets such a secret, how simple soe∣ver it be, he values it to the Patient richer then if made of Gold and Jems, which therefore when ever published to the world, must have some costly additions, to make his price seem conscionable, lest after
his death by his own confession, all that ever have used his Medicines should judge him an unconscionable cheat, and so posterity falsly attribu∣ted the singularity of the virtue of the Medicine to the most costly in∣gredients, come at last to leave out or neglect at least the due care and choyce of the most effectual ingre∣dient. Not that I do judge, or think, or contend for, that a Physician is to sell his Medicines at the rate they cost him, allowing such or such gain for his pains as a Merchant or Shop∣keeper takes. No verily, for first Medicines are not every mans mo∣ney, the whole need them not, and for their own use (so long as healthy) would not value that at twenty pence which might cost twenty pound. The sick only needs them, and to such they are precious, if effectual and applyed in season. As then I do not value Ambergreece the less, be∣cause
it is oft found by chance, and seldom costs the finder more then his pains to take it up, (the like may be said of Jems in their first finding) so I do not value a Medi∣cine by what it costs, but by what it will do, and according to the party to whom it is applyed. As then a poor mans credit is as dear to him as rich mans, yet a defamation which to one may not be valued at six pence, may to another be valued at six hun∣dred pound; so a Medicine which will cure both rich and poor, though given to the poor for nothing, yet doth not argue that it cost the maker of it nothing; and though the ma∣king of it cost not above five shil∣lings, yet this doth not hinder but it may be valued to a rich man at five pound, if it really do him more ad∣vantage then perhaps he would be without for five hundred pound. A Physician then is bound only to the rules of true Charity, and be∣ing
given of God to help and relieve the lives of many that are endange∣red, he may, and that piously, so take of the rich, as to be able to help the poor freely, and yet as cordially and as truely affording to them his best help and remedies, for nothing, as he doth to the rich for a re∣ward. Yet is it not fit that any reward should be accounted due where the disease is not cured; for the Patient doth not want a Doctor for to tell him a tale of his disease, nor yet to pray God for his recovery, but to administer to his disease, what may be effectual: a Saylor though he take never so much pains, yet is not paid that performes not his voyage; yea and all callings whatever are paid for their pains, only with proviso, that they do what they undertake; only a Doctor is paid for his pains though never so little to the purpose, which
is unconscionable; I confess that if the Patient finde him to be carefull and diligent he may order him some reward for his good will where he wanted in skill; but this the Doctor cannot challenge. The Do∣ctor on the Patients trial (where his remedy is frustraneous) learns (if he be honest) not too confidently to trust that Medicine in that case again; but what gets the Patient but only his labour for his pains in ta∣king it? and this hurt at the least, that so much time is lost and his cure never the nearer (if not the farther off by the diseases having had so long the more time on him) for which it is most unreasonable, that he should be accounted in the Do∣ctors debt. I must ingenuously confess, that as I alwaies reckoned a Doctors Art not to be bound to the ordinary rules of merchandise, because it re∣spected the lives of men not to be
bought or sold for money, so I could not but alwaies judge it unreasonable for a reward to be there demanded where no good is done: for the Art of Medicine is a mystery in which the common people have no skill, and when they are ill they want not a Doctor for his reverent looks, nor do they desire any thing promiscu∣ously for a Medicine, much less any dear thing, but only what may be good for the disease. If they knew a thing were not good for their ma∣lady, or that it were appointed on∣ly at a wilde random, they would be loath to buy it for themselves, though they might have it for half the worth of it, much less would they give ten times the price for it that the Apo∣thecary gives for it at first hand, which is the usual profit which some Apothecaries (on my knowledge) make of some, nay many of their slops). Are they the fathers of the sick?
And do they when the childe wants and asks bread, give a stone; when fish, a serpent; and over & besides sell these preposterous intrusions at ten, nay oft at twenty times the rate they are worth? The God of mercy deli∣ver all honest men from the hands of such devouring Caterpillers! When I first gave my self to Me∣dicinal practise, I confess I was asha∣med to ask a price for a Medicine I had not tryed, how ever commended by Authors. I knew it either must answer the patients expectation or no. If so, it then deserved a gratuity above its price; if not, the Patient could not in conscience be charged for that, which might have been equalled, if not excelled, by the ad∣vise of some old wife gratis. My usual word then to them was, that they should prove the effect in the first place, and then as the operation did succeed to be thankful. And I must protest, that mine ears
were soon dulled with the usual pa∣linode of, It did me no good, not∣withstanding all the promises of Au∣thors, and their method of cheating, their allowed Dispensatories. So that I was (as Helmont former∣ly) almost quite out of conceit of the Art of Medicine, accounting it and judging it to be but a cruel cheat, but at last I found that God had re∣served to himself a number who had not bowed the knee to the Baal of profit, covetousness; idleness, and ambition, whom therefore I seriously studied, and gave my self in imitation of them to the studious search of Na∣ture. At last God was pleased so to bless my studies, and hear my prayers, as to grant me the true keys of Chymical preparations, who gives to whom he pleaseth, and with-holds where he listeth, to him be glory fo ever. Then I could not but contemn the
usual vulgar preparations, as being grosly foolish, their compositions ri∣diculous, their corrections Ironical, in a word, the whole Art of vulgar Medicine, I found to be as if it had been invented by some Timon, or Misanthropos, on purpose to the de∣struction of Mankinde. They who desire to read more particularly concerning the folly and futility of vulgar Medicaments, I recommend them to the noble Hel∣mont his Pharmacopolium ac Dispen∣satorium modernum, where this sub∣ject is handled ad nauseam us{que}. I shall not inlarge hereon, lest I should seem but to eccho to him, whom my intent is only to defend and vindi∣cate. This I shall only say, that it is an unworthy thing that a Doctor should administer things which he knowes not by sight, and yet bless himself that he hath the knowledge of them, when what ever he knoweth of them
it is but upon credit by reading, the Author perhaps being a Grecian, Ita∣lian, Frenchman, or Spaniard, and yet he as confidently applying his di∣rection to men in England (where both Simples and constitutions o men are notably altered) as if no dif∣ference at all between place and per∣sons were. 'Tis an abuse likewise worthy the most biting and sharpest Satyr, that a Doctor should undertake the cur of lives, and yet commit the prepa∣ration of Medicaments to an Apo∣thecary, and he to his Apprentice not considering into what hazard they cast, and in what dangers they involve the Patient by this course for who is so stupid as to think, tha it is the Doctors name that will scar a disease into conformity? no ver∣ly, it must be the Medicine that mu effect the cure, in the preparation o which consists the greatest secret, an in it a small neglect is of fatal conse∣quence:
now what can be expected from an Apothecary, whose skill for the most part is no more then what an apprentiship hath gotten him, it is to me I confess ingenuous∣ly a thing of serious consideration. This I know, that the care of pre∣paration ought not to be lightly set by; yet what Mechanist is there, who prepares venal drugs, that can be confided in, but that he will either buy the cheapest and most rascal ingredients, or substitute quid pro quo, with a thousand deceits, be∣sides the neglect of his apprentice, to whom in the conclusion, the care of the preparation is committed. Thus I have not very largely, yet I hope fully Apologized for the Art of Pyrotechny: and supposing a Ga∣lenist for Moderator, I conceive that I hear him discharging me with a [Satisfecisti officio tuo] supposing an unprejudiced and judicious Reader, me thinks I hear him desiring after
this Apology, a discovery of such Medicaments, which may actually convince and maintain, what is here argumentally proved and as∣serted. The desire to me seems reasonable, and my spirit to answer the same is much inclined, which God willing shall be performed in an ensuing Disecourse, which shall fully and faithfully discover the more secret preparations of Medi∣cinal Arcana's with their true keys, in which I shall be so candid as to leave nothing undisclosed which a Son of Art may desire, yet so as not to transgress the lawes of Nature, and to prostitute her my∣sterious and secret operations to the eye of every Reader, but pre∣mising studious search and diligent inquiry, I shall be a faithful guide to such as by God are elected here∣unto, but to the rest I shall be obscure enough.
CHAP. III. A description of the true method of Medicine, and a discovery of such Medicaments as may evince the possessor of them to be a Physician created of God and not of the Schools. HAving in the two foregoing Chapters, on good grounds rejected the vulgar way of Medicine, and convinced it (notwithstanding the brags of our Goosequil Doctors concerning it) to be insufficient and dangerous, intended against (in stead of the disease) the life of the patient, in its Purgatives, Phlebotomy, Vesi∣cations, Scarifications, Fontinels, and starving Julips, and barly Broths, under the pretence of cooling the Body, and giving but ridiculous
hope of cure in its Dietical prescri∣ptions and Cordials so called, made of costly things ridiculously blended together, their Clysters, Conserves, Syrups, Lochsana's, distill'd waters, &c. which is so notorious as to be∣come a Proverb to the vulgar all the world over, although this foo∣lish method be embraced and hugg'd by our Methodists (as they call themselves, or more truly, Goosquil Pisse-prophets) who by long jugling have gotten reputation, which they have improved to what height is pos∣sible for the getting of money, with∣out regard to either Religion, con∣science, or honesty. It will now be convenient to come to the discovery of true Medicaments, which may perform that for the cure of those diseases to which mans frail nature is subject, which notwithstan∣ding the boasts of the Galenical Tribe they could never perform, and yet to see how craftily they have im∣posed
for mnny ages upon the cre∣dulous world, (not in trifles, but in great and vast sums of money, and their lives oft times to boot) would amaze any judicious observer of the same. Yea so confident are they in this their Art of jugling, as to glory therein, as in a notably deserving at∣chievement: insomuch that a Gen∣tleman of my acquaintance, of ac∣complished learning, and of so much conscience therewith, that he hath for nigh sixteen years through great difficulties, lived in defiance of the vulgar way of practise, to the pur∣chasing of the ill will and reproach of all or most of his friends, and consequently to the involving of himself in many pinching straights, which yet he chearfully underwent, and undergoes, rather then to get a living by an Art, which he plainly discovered to be a frivolous cheat, though a cruel butchery to the sick;
he then fearing the judgement to come, (although, without exception, a man of as able learning as the most cryed up Goosquil Piss-prophet in London) refused utterly the practise of Medicine in the vulgar way, al∣though for a livelihood, & although as absolutely accomplished for the pra∣ctise of the same, as the ablest of them for learning, (and whom the deaths of two or three hundred men would have brought to the same experience with them) nor was he then a Master of nobler secrets, and therefore ra∣ther chose an absolute contempla∣tive life, then to be imployed in such a barbarous butcherlike pra∣ctise. This man one day hapning to discourse with one of the Colleagues of our London Colledge, whom he reported to me, that he found a vain empty bladder, puft only with wind, and who besides his Hocus pocus Rhetorique applicable to his Art of jugling was a meer insipid no∣thing;
their conference being concer∣ning Astral Medicines, a thing so un∣known to our reverend Doctor, that the name seemed to him to sound like the title of an Exorcism; he therefore able to say nothing to him either in way of opposition or for confutati∣on, but that he neither knew nor be∣leeved any such thing; at last (lest he might seem able to say nothing to the purpose) concludes his dis∣course with this Rhodomontado, that he was able to get fifteen hundred pounds a year by his way of pra∣ctise, tacitly quipping the other, in that he by his Astral Medicines (commended) was not able then to get one hundred pounds per annum. To whom this Gentleman by way of reply objected, But how many Pa∣tients do you cure for this money? was snapt up with a frowning check, as though that were an impertinent question to be demanded of him that could and did get money, which ac∣cording
to the Logick of that Tribe is to be the measure of mens attain∣ments and abilities. And that it may not seem beyond belief, how so much money may be distilled out of mens purses in lieu of a smooth tale; the same Gentleman told me, that a Kinsman of his (an Alderman of this City, and his La∣dy) had both told him, the one by way of complaint, the other by way of boasting, that in short time his Apothecaries Bill came to three hundred pounds, (to whom this fifteen hundred pound Doctor had been and still is Physician) and this in short time, and in the mean sea∣son no considerable distemper ha∣ving taken either himself, or Lady, or any of his family: now by the Apothecaries Bils, few men but can judge shrewdly at the Doctors Fees, & if he be not a verier idiot then ma∣ny of his brethren, one of them three hundred pounds will come into his
pocket, which his Bils well deserve for a trick that he both knowes, and probably practiseth, to my know∣ledge some of his brethren do, and I know the trick likewise, and have hinted it elsewhere, and therefore shall leave it now. And we shall come to the true Art and method of Medicine, which although (through the ingrateful∣ness of the time and this Age to true discoveries of Nature) it prove not so lucriferous as the other, yet is it such an Art, which is followed with wealth sufficient for a Son of Art. True, the highest of a Son of Arts ambition and desire is, to be able to attend future searches, and in the mean while to live as becomes a Philosopher in mediocrity, (not superfluity) and this without distra∣ction: whereas a Goosquil Doctor, (accounting himself only a fit com∣panion for Ladies) must go arrayed in choice silk, plush, and velvet, with
a Ladies hand, and his Coach to at∣tend him, if he but stir out of doors, and therefore must have larger in∣comes to maintain this pomp. Yet I know that although I con∣sume and spend whatever moneys I can borrow from my bare necessity, or at utmost my most absolute con∣veniency, in Furnaces, Coals, and Glasses, with the Bee making Ho∣ny, but not for my self, yet the ex∣perience, which through Gods bles∣sing this industry hath brought, doth and will bring me, will make my name live, when the names of hun∣dreds, that bark and snarl at me, and load me with unworthy reproaches, shall lie buried in perpetual obli∣vion. Let not then any think to scare me with the Rhodomontado of our forementioned fifteen hundred pound Doctor (per annum) for when both we shall come to give up our ac∣counts to the great Judge, I know
it will not be objected there as a crime to me, that I cure in a year al∣most, (if not altogether) as many Patients that are poor gratis, as he hath for his fifteen hundred pounds; that to others that are rich, I give both Medicins and counsel, asking nothing till the cure is performed, and then by some put off with little, and by some with nothing, because my Medicaments are but little in quantity, and the cure (beyond ex∣pectation) speedily effected, and yet what ever I do get I lay out in fu∣ture discoveries, and all to do good to an ungrateful generation: oft times running in debt for conveniencies, and necessaries, and sparing out of my belly to finde out new experiments in Medicine; and yet for all this get∣ting on one hand hatred & opposition, and on the other hand, contempt for performing cures so soon and cheap: yet I know that my reward will be a good name when I am gone, and
from God hereafter, whereas they that expect no reward beyond their Fees, it is no marvel if they be so sordid in raking them out of even the bowels of their distressed clients, in lieu of which they give them on∣ly smooth and fallacious language, and yet are highly esteemed because they cheat them with a grace, and put a high price upon their butche∣ries: This! O this! cryes them up for brave fellowes, and makes them admired & adored by the simpler sort. And to say the truth, there is one thing which as ordered by them, and made use of to their advantage, they blinde the eyes of the common peo∣ple withall, and ascribe very much to themselves on that score: and that is in Feavers, which disease, dan∣gerously threatning the life, being in∣deed mortal to very many, and sad∣ly afflictive to all that are visited therewith, being accompanied with many sad and perplexing accidents,
very grievous and troublesome to be undergone, as violent thirst, a tormen∣ting heat and burning of the body causing restlesness, with pain or light∣ness in the head, an oppression at the stomack, with a dejcted appetite, and a loathing of all meats, a disre∣lish both of meats and drinks, with many other troublesome and dangerous symptomes, rendring the life wearisome to the Patient, and in great hazard to the beholders. These Symptomes though not alike troublesome to each affected party, are scarce in the course of or∣dinary providence mortal to the third sick feaverish man, since two in three Feavers, if wholly let alone, and the party attended only with careful∣ness, would after the Crisis, end usu∣ally in health, though accompanied with much debilitation; but because that this disease is not to be trusted, proving each year really mortal to many, by its exceeding troublesome
symptomes threatens death unto all, and therefore (because experience hath taught the world for many Ages that there is cure for diseases attainable by Art) each sick party taken ill in places where Doctors may be had, consulteth with them, in hope of cure, though in the Coun∣trey Villages, with far greater suc∣cesse, they give parties that are taken ill, either a Rosemary, or a Carduus Posset, and so provoke sweat, yea and in Cities, the poorer sort, who cannot reach unto a Doctors Fee use the same course, by which means many Feavers very violent in sym∣ptomes, though not so deeply roo∣ted, are speedily extinguished, but where the disease with this old wives Medicine will not be abated nor cu∣red, there the party, if possible, will make any shift, to get one of the more conscionable Doctors, that is one who being of less note and pra∣ctise, will be content with less Fees,
rather then not be imployed, who going in the same rode with his cryed up Brethren, will be tamper∣ing with Cordials as he calleth them, and cooling Julips; by Phleboto∣my, Vesications, Scarifications, Fri∣cations, or the like, till he make ma∣ny Feavers prove mortal by his Art, which otherwise attended only with care to keep them from the cold, and giving orderly meats and drink in season, would be extinguished of their own accord after the Crisis, and those few Feavers, which by all these de∣vices are not enraged even to death, nor yet by their cruel forbidding of Beer, and almost all drink, whereby the disease wasts the radical humidi∣ty for want of due moisture, yet are they made so dangerous that death is oft expected each hour, not only at the first crisis, but after, even to the twentieth, many times to the thirtieth day; during which time, the mouth being very foul, and oft
sore, the tongue black, the breath ni∣dorous, the visage representing rather a ghost then a man ordained to life; the Doctor is attendant (if a rich Pa∣tient) twice, at least once every day, and each time with an affected pen∣siveness appointing this or that Sy∣rup, or Lotion, or Julip, or Cordial, or Lenitive, or what else his phanta∣sie dictates, and in the pitch of ex∣tremity slced Pigeons or Herrings are laid to the soles of the feet, and a precise diet commanded upon signs of mending: thus maugre the disease and the Doctor, through the good hand of God; and the benigni∣ty of nature, the party escapes death, yet scare able to go boldly abroad in two, three, or four moneths, and perhaps through this ordering in cure, for an epilogue of his Feaver, contracts a Chronick disease, which leaves him not during life; this then is a cryed up, and a very notable cure, for which perhaps the Doctors
(if a rich man) many being called to consultation, share an hundred or two pounds of his money, and the Apothecaries Bill amounting to half as much. Of such a reputed cure as this (of which had they any grace, they ought to be as asham'd as a School-boy of playing the trewant) they will boast much, and oppose themselves by way of contempt against any Artist, as never having any such cure. Truth, I grant that I never had any such cure, and am therefore bound to give eternal thanks to God, who hath chosen me to ano∣ther, then that sordid, ungodly, un∣conscionable, butcher-like practice, by which I certainly, and safely, and speedily cure that disease, with the Pleurisie, and all Agues, even Quar∣tan, and Autumnal, yea Hyemal, without bloud-letting, or purging, without forbidding drink, nay al∣lowing both strong Beer and Wine
with moderation in Feavers of all sorts, in Agues and in Pleurisies, with small curiosity in ordering the diet, and yet my patients soundly cured, without danger of relapse, often at a dose or two, most of all in three or four daies; Pleurisies per∣fectly cured as soon; and Agues in one, two or three fits, in the spring and summer; and in the autumn or winter seldome exceeding five or six fits, and through Gods blessing the cure never missing, unless the Patient prove unruly and not submit to, or fickle and so not abide in my dire∣ctions. Yet can I confidently affirm and make good, that I yearly cure more Feavers, Agues, and Pleurisies, then any one in the Galenical way have in nigh twice the time; but my cures are too contemptible for the rich, Counsel and Medicine in almost two thirds of my cures scarce exceeding, sometimes not amounting to a
Crown, not one in forty rising to a∣bove an Angel. For many hundreds know and can testifie for me, that besides my own cures, many both in City and Countrey practise by my medicines, to the cure and relief of some thou∣sands yearly, mine own practise in some years reaching to nigh two hundred Agues, as I can make ap∣pear, with many more Feavers, Pleurisies, Fluxes, and vomitings, of all which scarce five in a year not perfectly cured, and those only such who hearing of the sudden effect of my medicines, send for some of them, and without observing the difference of season of the year, ex∣pect the same speed in cure with o∣thers, and not finding the cure perfect, (although notably abated) are discouraged, and leave off, whose error herein is not to be charged up∣on the Medicine. Nor is it any thing to me of mo∣ment,
or ought it to be to any ju∣dicious man, that Galenists rashly and impudently rail and crie out a∣gainst Chymicall Medicaments, and yet the most desperate of all in that Art preparable, they have ravished into their Apothecaries Shops, and have accepted, and do own them, as sworn servants to their method. Which charge if they deny, Tur∣bith Minerale, Mercurius dulcis, vi∣tae, praecipitate severall wayes, Cro∣cus metallorum, Antimonium Dia∣phoreticum, Stibium, &c. shall be summoned in, to give testimony to their very faces, which are medi∣cines unfit for an honest man to use, all save Antimonium Diaphoreticum, which is a trifle, being so oft burnt with Salt Peter, till it become an insipid Calx, of very little vertue, in comparison to wit, of that emi∣nent virtue, and noble excellency which we boast of in Antimony.
Therefore, courteous Reader, do not think, that we in commending the noble true Chymicall Medicines, do mean these rascall, virulent, hor∣rible Medicaments, but leave them to the Galenicall Tribe, (ut similes labris lactucas) that with them they may fill up the measure of their ini∣quity, and do here attest the supreme Judge of Heaven and Earth, that we both abhorre the use of them, and dehort all that are wise to be∣ware of them, as dangerous poy∣sons. For we intend here absolute inge∣nuity, to speak of Professors, and of Medicines as they are, and not to plead for this spurious venemous Brat, because it may seem to be a Chymicall Bastard, but we disown it wholly, as an off-spring of Rene∣gado, and fugitive Apostate Chymists, Mimicks and Apes to true Philoso∣phie, but not her legitimate Sonnes, the disgrace of Art, and therefore
fit to be marked with a black note o infamy. O foolish Doctors! who hath bewitched you, that you will not see, nor abide the truth? O silly and blind followers of these perverse blind guides! how long will you be deceived? attend I pray you for your own good, to him who is ready to teach you better. Strange! Certainly a deep sleep from God hath besotted the under∣standing of our wise men, since our Princes of Zoan in this one thing are fools, though in other things a∣cute enough, whom so many lost lives as yet cannot make wise, sufficiently to distinguish between reality of truth and an Imposture. Wo is me, that I am and must be in this thing a Sonne of Contention, and must contend with almost all the earth: sure it is not for my in∣ward ease and contentment, but it is even as a fire to my bowels; al∣though
since it is truth that is to be defended, to betray which in a cause of so high concernment (as the lives of thousands) were so high an in∣gratitude to God, who hath discove∣red the mysteries of nature to me, blessed be his name) that I might ustly fear not only the deprivement of this Talent, but the other doom of the unprofitable Servant, the dread of whose exemplary punishment doth compell me thus to bring my Talent n to the Bank, and expose what God hath discovered to me, to the iew and censure of a captious gene∣ration, of whom I expect reproach, disdain and contumelie full measure, nd heaped, yet is there a certain umber of the sonnes of Wisdom, om whom I shall receive both hanks and encouragement. For whose information and in∣struction sake, we shall in a brief discourse, so clucidate the nature of ue medicine, as to make it appear
to any one whom passion or folly, o self-conceitednesse hath not blinded to be a most safe, speedy and certai way of curing diseases, which thre things are required in all Medicines promised to be in the Galenicall an Pseudochemicall, but to be foun only in the true Pyrotechnicall se∣crets. So then, by this our art of med∣cine, which we commend, we know and promise the cure of all disease accidentall to the body of ma speedily, safely, and certainly, an do affirm our Medicines to have a adaequate virtue in them to this en which we shall make good, and pe∣mit in the mean time our adversari in opposition to snarle till they cra their spleen. And for the Readers informatio. I must give him an account, that  purpose is here to give things as  a small Mappe, and to represent the as it were in a Land-skip, very ca∣didly,
though concisely, very lively, though as at a little distance. First then let no man expect from me linear receipts, for that would be foolish in me to perform, and therefore fond in them to expect; for I shall not write of trifles, but of commanding Arcanaes, which re∣quire to be discovered in the lan∣guage of the Magi, lest fools and Mechanists, bring these so noble secrets into common Shops, to be adulterated as all their Chymical fop∣peries are. Which pitiful hotch-potch had its originall from rare secrets of Art, although through ignorance and misapprehension of dull, lazy heads, and searchers, they are under the same names with those renowned se∣crets of Theophrastus Paracelsus, be∣come rascally venemous dangerous slops as they are adulterately, and knavishly prepared for sale, and according to the allowed Receipts of
vulgar Tyrocinists and Pharmacopaea's, they are at the best either dangerous, as having only a mock (in stead of a due and true) preparation, as the vo∣mitive, Salivative, and purgative preparations of Mercury and Antimo∣nie, or trivial, as the commonly ve∣nall spirits of Salts, the Alcalies, waters and Oyls of Concretes vege∣tall: to which may be added the newfound silly dotages of some par∣ticular Sophisters, as the Ignis vitae of one, the universall Medicine of another idle Sciolist; the one, the product of Soot, the other of Mens bones rotted, whose rash ventosities and aery promises we reject as apo∣state Renegado cheats in Art, under the visard or mask of Chymistry, as Allen the notable Theef, is report∣ed to have rob'd in a Coach with his Complices, under the disguise of a Bishop with his Attendants. Of this I have given caution, and spoken sufficiently, in a Treatise
concerning this Art of Medicine, intituled, The Art and mystery of Py∣rotechny, taught, and illustrated. Then which Tractate the world ne∣ver yet saw a plainer, and only writ∣ten from the fountain of experience, which I purpose to bestow as a Lega∣cie upon the Sons of this Art, as I finde this gets acceptance, and there∣fore I shall not repeat here what is fully delivered and made plain there. However as I hinted, our common∣ly venal Mercurius dulcis, is a Fairy changeling intruded upon the world, for the sweet oyl or Ladanum of Mercury, fixt as gold, and sweet as hony (in its first fixation) which co∣rollated, is Paracelsus Arcanum Co∣rallinum, otherwise called Mercurius praecipitatus dulcis, which by coho∣bation with the fire of Hell, (that is, the Alchahest) becomes volatile, and sweet like hony; and withall being anodynous, is called Ladanum Mer∣curii, and not seldom Mercurius dul∣cis,
which can never be revived to Mercury again, but by the same Art which would revive gold, and discover its central Mercurial pro∣fundity. I need not instance in other mock mimical preparations falsly obtru∣ded upon the world, for Paracelsus never sufficiently to be commended Secrets, as Mercurius vitae, Aurum vitae, Magisteries of Pearls and Jemmes, their quintessences of An∣timony, &c. of which comparing their either desperate efficacy, or ri∣diculous languidness, with the pro∣mise of Paracelsus and Helmont, con∣cerning their Arcanaes of those names, he may say with the Poet, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici Being a true embleme of the Moun∣tains travel, or the shearing of hogs, the one after infinite expectation, producing a silly mouse, the others
after the Proverb, making a foul squeaking for a little wool. I know that the Galenical Tribe will whine and hone pitifully, ra∣ther then lose to be reputed Chy∣mists; nay if we may believe them, they have prepared for them the choicest of Chymical preparations, and some pretend to very great share in the skill of this Art them∣selves. If so, I am glad, for to such I may address my self, as a Brother, and without vanity let me speak it, such a one of whom the best accom∣plished in that way of Pyrotechny, may not be ashamed of: for though I am low and vile sufficiently in my own eyes, yet when I must give a true testimony concerning my indu∣stry, my searches, and my attain∣ments, to the glory of God may it be spoken, I have learned practical∣ly to understand both Paracelsus, and Helmont, and know what they write to be true; and though I am an un∣worthy
nothing, yet when the Gale∣nists come to vie their mock Chy∣mistry, with that which God hath made me to understand by the rea∣ding of Helmont and Paracelsus, through the tutorage, and under the ferula of the fire, then as Paul when contesting with the false Brethren and Pseudo-apostles, would not give way to them one jot; no more shal I, forasmuch as I do contend and stand up for truth it self, and do not fight nor am engaged in any perso∣nal quarrel. Thanks be to God then, that I fall not short in mine understanding of ought of the Arcanaes of Paracelsus and Helmont, through the blessing of him who chose me before many who excel me far in parts in the Gal∣nical Tribe: in which respect, not transgressing the bounds of modesty, confessing what ever I have recei∣ved to have been from above, I shall yet be more confident, and do affirm
that the Chymistry of the Galenical Tribe is a ridiculous partly, and part∣ly dangerous Empericism, in stead of so commendable a Method, and Art, as they with confidence and im∣pudence sufficient boast it to be; and though I am of my self a weak and unworthy person, to combate with such an army of Philistims, yet as they once fell before Jonathan and his Armourbearer, so shall as many as oppose me, fall before the truth which I stand up for, but they have forsaken, and now persecute and re∣sist. When it was first told me that very many of our Colledge Doctors did pretend to Chymistry and to Furnaces, think you that I envied them for my own sake? No verily, but I did then, and do now wish, that not only some, but all of them might equall, nay exceed both Paracelsus and Helmont, so would much good be done, yet would not I be the Au∣thor of bringing such a thing into
practise, far be it from me (even to think so) for God will be the dispen∣ser of these Talents to the worlds end, nor hath he left my spirit free but absolutely bound up in this par∣ticular, whereby I know that yet these things shall be hid, and that concerning these things between me and the Galenists, will be many sharp conflicts, but I shal and must prevail, and shall both by argument and ex∣periment, batter down not only their old way, of which I spake in my Apo∣logetical part sufficiently, but also this new way of Mimical Chymistry, which they presume (being added to the other) may prove to their safe standing, as an high wall about a Castle or Town, I shall lay flat to the ground, and the ruine of this rotten (though patcht up, and gaudi∣ly garnished) fabrick will be great. The various providences of God and dispensations toward me, are a sure earnest to me, and confirmation
of my spirit that I am reserved to, and preserved for more then ordina∣ry imployment in this particu∣lar. Let us come then to the true Art of healing, which is the right and only test for comparing, and trying our skill, it being the best way, to have the work man judged by his work. How long will the world hang be∣tween two opinions? If the Gale∣nical way be the truth, let it be esta∣blished, if not, let it fall, and be brought to ruine. Some mightily addicted to the common way, and withall, my very good friends, have spoken to me from the dictates of some Galenists, how easily my way might be reconciled to the other, to the making up be∣tween both, that which is defective in each, my Medicines, to wit, with an able Galenists Method, being judged a mixture convenient to make up a most admirable Art of Medi∣cine.
This hath been spoken aloud to me by many who were cordial friends to me, as a wise course to be taken; which counsel proceeded (as I said) from some Gaenists, or ra∣ther of the Tribe of Goosquil Piss∣prophets, who finding my Cures be∣yond cavil, and my Medicaments so safe, as to admit of no jealousie con∣cerning them, used this as a crafty way of lessening my repute, to make as though they had an Art, by which they in their method (as they call it) could do much more then I did or could do, with the same things, as for want of method being to seek of the most safe and effectual use of my own Medicines, which without Art, were accidental with me (as sometimes choice secrets may be found with old women). This opi∣nion having fastned upon the spirits of my immovably favouring friends, to others they pretend no difference between my medicines and theirs,
but that theirs are the safer and bet∣ter, or at least that my Medicines are no others then such as all of them know, and use. So then they who (where they cannot allow me less) will only al∣low me (habnab) experimental re∣ceipts, casually gotten, without Art, for methodical applying the same, they to others will allow me nothing but what may be common to any Mountebank, or Emperick, and so they confidently, and (would seem to think) conscionably style me. Let us therefore come to take a brief view or survey of Diseases in their right way of natural cures, that so we may opportunely make an or∣derly essay of Medicines, such to wit, which deserve that name, and are not Ironically, or Antiphrastically named so. And as for the Galenists (so cryed up) Method, we shall discover it to be a meer Chimera, a groundless opi∣nion,
which to the cost of many thou∣sand lives hath gotten reputation in the world, through the just judge∣ment of God, and the penal blind∣ness in this particular of most (if not all) of the wise men in all Nations, and civilized (especially Christian) Countreys. For Medicine is so named (a me∣dondo, from healing) and imports as much as that it is an Art shewing Medicaments that have sufficient effi∣cacy for the subduing and taking away any disease or distemper to which the life of mortal man is sub∣ject, though the Galenists tacitly con∣fessing their inabilities, have since the invention of the cheat of their (eve∣ry where declaimed) Method, chan∣ged the name (medendi, of healing by Medicines) to the notion (curandi, of taking care of the sick, or using their trifling diligence) by their Me∣thod. I shall therefore boldly set foot to
foot, and fairly come to Cornish hug with the Goosquil champions, and let us see whether of us two will be the strongest, nor doubt I before I have done to give them a fair fall. Is our Art (as I have declared) in its primitive verity, and reality, Medicinae Ars, the Art of healing, non curationis, not of taking care only of the sick? (as our modern Do∣ctors have found out a new word) then let us see how each of us per∣form this, and this we shall instance first in the most common and sponta∣neously transient, and then in the more unusual Chronick diseases: And first for the Feaver in its several kinds, of which I gave even now a brief touch, and shall here more largely insist, and yet in as few lines as may be, because I intend this only as a small map of many things, to represent them together here in a brief Chapter, which in distinct Treatises I have handled severally,
and largely enough in several Cha∣pters elsewhere; all which Tractates, (being troublesom enough to me to digest into that method they are in, but more troublesom, nay toylsom and chargeable to me to get that ex∣perience out of which I then wrote, and do here write) I shall God per∣mitting make publick, for the bene∣fit of such who have given up their names to Art, so soon as I shall finde what entertainment this little Tra∣ctate shall finde in the world: For after this Apologetical Discourse hath brought me word what recepti∣on it finds, I resolve () to send out several Essays upon Hel∣monts discoveries, and in particular upon that concerning Feavers, the Gout, and the Dropsie, that so the common whine may be taken away from the Galenists, (viz.) that the Helmontian Sect only beat down, but do not build up; labour what they can to ruine the old way, never
taking care to introduce a bet∣ter. To proceed at present with our begun discourse concerning the Fea∣ver, a sad, comfortless, truculent dis∣ease, then which there is none more mortal, insomuch that according to the common Adagy, Nemo sine fe∣bri moritur: which to my under∣standing, is a position more subtle then true; yet it speaks aloud, the sad universal afflictive nature of that disease; of which it is truly said, that it is an epidemical disease, no Nation in which yearly (at all sea∣sons of the year) there are not sad examples of its mortal rigor and se∣verity, and therefore ought much to employ the studies of such who have given up their names to Medicine, to finde out certain remedies for the same. The saddest of all Feavers, the Pestilence (called by a general name, the Plague among us) as being re∣puted,
and not without cause, the sad∣dest of temporal plagues: that I shall passe over at present in silence, as ne∣ver having (to my knowledge) ex∣perience in that disease, though of Feavers commonly known by the name of pestilential Feavers, and judged to be a degree of the Pesti∣lence it self, I have known and cured many, and those with as much ease, speed and certainty as any other ma∣lignant Feaver; or should I doubt, if it should seem good to God to vi∣sit us with that washing calamity, (which my daily prayers shall be against) but to restore it speedily, cer∣tainly and safely, provided the dis∣ease had not prevailed unto despair before I took it in hand. But from the opportunity of trial what my Medicines will do in this particular, I desire God would still be pleased to keep me, yet so confident I am in such medicines that I know I should not fear (if occasion were)
to adventure the visitation of as ma∣ny as I could possibly relieve by my presence and help. Next to the pestilence under this head of Feavers may be reckoned the small Pox, which are indeed no other then a very malignant sort of Feaver, so reckoned by Fernelius as able a Doctor as ever the Academies afforded, and Sennertus also of no less fame and repute. This kinde of Feaver so baffles Physicians, that Nurses and Mid∣wives are more generally consulted with and relied upon in this case then Doctors, and they when ever consulted herein, become at the best ridiculous, and deservedly; nor are they often made use of in such cases, unless where the beauty of some young Nymph or Adonis lies at stake, there is the Doctor advised, though able to perform less then an ordinary Nurse, which common people know, and therefore never
trouble the Doctor in such cases. Bloud-letting, and purging in this condition are desperate dotages, and seldome expiated with ought but death, on which score Sir Theodore Mayberne is reported unwittingly to have kill'd his Son-in-law intended, a just reward for a butcherlike Phle∣botomist. Severall upon my knowledge, be∣ing blouded by the Doctors com∣mand in the beginning of this dis∣ease (being mistaken by them for an ordinary Feaver) have paid the price of the Doctors folly with their lives. And as for purgatives, the Gly∣ster-pipe family themselves dare not not prescribe them after two or three daies in any violent continual Fea∣ver, till the febrile matter be digested, that is, till nature hath overcome the disease, and then they come after all with the Irish-man to kill a man by cutting off his legs, because his head
was cut off before; but as for the case of the small Pox, it is so com∣monly known to every Midwife and Nurse, that a lask is therein lethal, that upon the appearing thereof, they do give over the party for lost, un∣less by restrictives, the loosness may be stopt, and unless that be perfor∣med, (if the party affected be full of those variolae, which the Pox sends forth) certain death follows. The same in pestilential Feavers is evident, where phlebotomy & purgatives are very dangerous, nay desperate, by wch it may be strongly concluded, that if in the Plague, the Smal pox, and Pestilential Feavers, phlebotomy, a loose belly, and cooling drinks are of very bad consequence, so to wit, as to cause death in many, to indanger life in all, that then the same things can not in reason be of good effect in any Feaver, which brings me by the hand to the discovery of my method and Medicines for the cure of this
disease, the better to compare it with the way commonly practised, by which both of them the better may be judged of, and censured. For Feavers are of sundry sorts, either continual or intermittent. The continual are various, of which the saddest is the Plague, next the Smal∣pox, next the pestilential Feaver, next the malignant, which is scarlet, pur∣ple, &c. to which may be reckoned the Pleurisie, which is a real sort of Feaver, more violent by reason of an Apostemated matter threatned in the side, of which it hath its denomi∣nation, this accompanied with a cough, and spitting of bloud, with a tormenting pain, is thought incura∣ble without Phlebotomy, and so the vulgar are perswaded by Doctors and Chirurgeons, though very falsly. Intermittent Feavers are of seve∣ral sorts, either Ephemerial, or Ter∣tian, or Quartan, of which the two
last sorts are either single or dupli∣cate: and lastly there is the Erratick intermittent Feaver, called by Para∣celsus (Febris extranea) of all which are so many appearances, that it would require a large Treatise to describe all the kinds of this dis∣ease. But as for the cure, (or rather the way and means of restoring this kinde of disease) therein the Galeni∣cal Tribe and I differ very much, we only agree in the names and sym∣ptomes of the same, concerning which, let it not be objected that I leave out the names of Feavers Hemitritean, &c. since it is not my design in this place to make a curi∣ous Anatomy of that disease, in its kindes, according to its various Sym∣ptomes (performed both learnedly, and acurately by many Galenists, as Fernelius and others, who being professed Methodists, were yet ho∣nourers of Chymical Medicaments
as their writings do testifie) which were a work of a peculiar Tractate to perform. And to say truth, the disease is sufficiently known, being so com∣mon and so truculent, that not only a Doctor, but each ordinary Nurse can tell when a man or woman is Fea∣verish, although to know certainly the kinde of each Feaver is a task sometimes too hard for a professed Doctor, and yet that may be known and the disease as far from cure as before; therefore well said he who sang thus: Non opus est morbi testibus, at medico. To the certain, safe, and speedy cure of which malady I shall now come, and that not perhaps with∣out great expectation, which I shall do my endevour to answer to the in∣genuous readers satisfaction. In order to which task, I shall
premise some positions by way of Aphorism very true and certain, however contrary to the common∣ly practised way of the Schools. 1. That the heat which appears in some, nay most Feavers, is not originally from the nature of the Feaver. This appears first in intermittent Feavers, (commonly known by the name of Agues among us) in which the cold fit in each access, is of the most afflictive part of the distemper, and torments with a violent thirst, yet without any sensible heat. But nextly, all malignant Feavers, (some more, some less) begin with a sen∣sible internal cold, and a quivering or shaking withall, after which fol∣lowes burning. Thirdly, Castrensian or Camp Feavers (a kinde of Feaver but late∣y known among mankind) from he beginning of them to the end of heir Tragedy, are without either
thirst or heat, and yet as truculent as any malignant Feaver whatever. Adde to this, that all Feavers when they draw towards a conclusion abate of their heat, although the disease be more violent then as draw∣ing nearer to death. To which agrees that the Fea∣vers of old persons, and such who are of very weak decayed bodies, ma∣nifest far less heat and burning, then far milder Feavers do in strong vi∣gorous bodies, and lusty constituti∣ons, and that leads me to the second conclusion or Aphorism. 2. That the more sensible the party affected is of heat, and bur∣ning, the more strength he may be∣judged to have, and the better pro∣bability of his recovery. For it is the Archeus of the life whence this rage proceeds, being provoked by some accidental mat∣ter, whence the first offence do arise, or from some Ideal characte
instamped upon the seat of life, or some near adjoyning sympathizing part, either by mean of a virulent endemical fume, or exhalation, or of some passion of the minde, which by its tyrannical impression doth di∣sturb the seat of life, that is its own original habitation, (the soul and life being originally seated in one and the same part) whence is caused this or that disease, according as the passive part doth receive the injury. For it is not necessary that a Fea∣ver should finde alway an occasional matter ready prepared, since it is evident, that grief, fear, &c. have power to give originall being to this disease, and so an eminent cold (espe∣cially after being throughly warm) which without controversie only in∣rage the Archeus, by instamping an unusual Character on its place of habitation, and so consequently fol∣low febrile excrements, which had not being before.
The vital Archeus, is that Vulcan in man, which doth stir up and feed that heat of life, which from the first hour of life till death goes never out, which in health is orderly and regular, but being provoked, rageth according to the known rule, Idem agens laesus edit actiones laesas, qui sanus, edit actiones sanas. Proportionable therefore to the provision for life, is the virtue and strength of the Archeus, whose rage in burning in Feavers, is nothing else but a gathering together its for∣ces to expell its adversary, that is, to blot out that character, which ei∣ther cold or virulent fumes, or pas∣sions of the minde have instamped on its place of habitation, and so pro∣portionable to the strength of nature is the burning in such cases, and this leads me to my third conclusion. 3. That bloud-letting and purga∣tions, and cooling drinks, are unrea∣sonable
waies to be used by him that pretends to cure Feavers. For Nature only is the immediate helper both of Feavers and all dis∣eases, which assail the life primarily and in their first intention, now if the provision for life, be the subject cause of heat in Feavers, what ever is inten∣ded primarily against heat, must im∣pugn the subject principle of life, and this is the master-piece of the Gale∣nists method, namely to take part a∣gainst nature to whose help alone they are called by the sick Patient. That the life is in the bloud is most certain, and by how much of it is taken away, by so much is the vitall Balsam wasted, and therefore very unwisely taken away, if the dis∣ease may be cured without: and that leads me to the fourth Conclusion. 4. That all Feavers, Agues, and Pluresies, may be cured without Phlebotomy. In the Plague, Small Pox, and
pestilential Feavers, the question by our Antagonists will be yeelded, eve∣ry year affording sad presidents of Galenists dotages in this kinde, as I instanced before in that great Do∣ctor Sir Theodore Mayherne, and could instance in above forty, that my self have known and observed, and that very lately, but in the Pleu∣resie it will be a great controversie, because without bloud-letting that disease is commonly reputed dead∣ly without hope or help, although that opinion be altogether ground∣less and false. Truth, the Pleuresie is a most dan∣gerous Feaver, with a Spasmus or Convulsion of the side (especially the left) among the ribs, a little be∣low the heart, this accompanied with the Cough, doth make a for∣cible dilaceration in that place, and that causeth extravenate bloud, and that threatning apostemati∣on, indangers the suffocation of the
party affected, without a speedy re∣medy, forasmuch as extravenate bloud in such a heat, will not be long uncorrupted, but that the proper, speedy and adequate remedy of this grief is bloud-letting that I deny. That by bleeding in the beginning this disease findes mitigation by mean of the revulsion or diversion made thereby I grant, and yet this notwithstanding phlebotomy is a dangerous often, desperate some∣times, alwaies a prejudicial prescri∣ption (be the prescriber who he will) which hath its absolute inseparable inconveniencies annexed to it, and following it, on which score it is not a remedy for an honest man to ap∣ply or prescribe. That an eminent fright will take away not only Agues, but other more deeply rooted and Chronick diseases, is a thing very well known to many, and would be believed by more, yet the practise of that way of
cure hitherto hath not, and I presume never will prevail in the world. At that sad fire by Gunpowder in Tower-street, I heard of many cured of rigorous maladies, by being put in a sudden fright to run for their lives, and many on the fright sick∣ned, and there first took the begin∣nings of those diseases which after proved mortall to them, and many mothers miscarried, and many women fell into uterine (and those terrible) passions: the like in other frights may be instanced, as in taking of Ci∣ties and Towns, unexpected alarms, &c. in which cases, many have risen from their sick beds, and come from their sick chambers, and fought stoutly for their lives, and lost their disease they knew not how, others contracted diseases of which they ne∣ver before were sensible, and of which afterwards they have never been rid. For to say truth, a disease is most
of all the fury of the indignation of the Archeus, which finding a preter∣usual character impressed on its place of habitation, straight rages, and acts in its fury beyond all rule and mea∣sure (this is the disease) whereas that fury being pacified, the product Na∣ture can finde waies to evacuate with ease, and the character impressed (be∣ing but transient) would abide but a short time (as the smell of garlick in the breath of him that eats it) only the Archeus growing mad, as concei∣ving its habitation unfit to be indured with that odious Idea, sets all on fire, producing a real misery (from it self effectively) on apprehension of a conceived injury so verifying the Proverb, Nemo laeditur nisi à seipso. Now the life dwelling in the bloud, and the balsam of life being contained therein, the taking of this away doth threaten ruine to the life, and so consequently to the Archus, which is but its immediate servant,
by which fear it is oft taken from its fury, to the abatement of Symptomes speedily, after which sometimes the Archeus repents of its former fury and madness, and so by accident this evil of the losing bloud produ∣ceth health, sometimes when the danger threatned by loss of bloud is over, the Archeus returns to its for∣mer fury, and afflicts, though not altogether with its former rigor, (the principle of life being wasted) yet so as to delude afterward the vain Art of the Doctor, and for its Epi∣logue ends in a Tabes, according to Galen, who laies down for a maxim, Pleuretici nisi restaurentur intra qua∣dragenarium fiunt Tabifici. But admit the cure were certain, by bleeding (as it is not) yet is it not to be practised by an ingenuous man, since at the best it cures only by accident, and that by fear of grea∣ter danger, drawing or rather forcing the Archeus out of its rage and fury,
by which means the threed of life is cut shorter, by wasting its subject in which it is kept, and by which it is maintained, especially if it may be certainly, speedily, and safely cured and the bloud preserved, which is a thing promised by Paracelsus, Hel∣mont, &c. and performable by medi∣cines that are preparable by the Art of Pyrotechny, of which I shall by and by give an account to the studi∣our and judicious Reader. I shall have don in this place with Phleboto∣my, because elsewhere I shall have occasion to ventilate it, only this I shall say, that it is an inhumane bar∣barous butchery, because so much bloud as is taken away, so much is cut off from the threed of life, and so the Doctor becomes Journeyman to Atropos; cutting short the life of ma∣ny by the rules of his Art, or at least impairing their strength, which art so magnified is at the best but a dotage, because that where ever it
is used with shew of good successe, and colour of necessity, there I know the cure may be performed without loss of one drop of bloud, and so I come to examine purgatives; con∣cerning which I shall propound a fifth Conclusion. 5. That no purge (quatenus pur∣ging) is an intentional remedy against a Feaver, or Pleuresie, nor Vomiting (as a vomit). For Purges (properly so called, or rather improperly) are absolute ve∣nomes confounded by the Art, (sometimes with a little knavery to∣gether) of the Apothecary, and so prescribed ignorantly by the Doctor, and taken unsuccessefully by the Pa∣tient. These in the Plague, Small Pox, and malignant Feavers, after the ap∣pearing of Symptomes with rigor, are like fiends that must be conju∣red down till another season, that is, till the matter be digested, or rather
in other words, till nature hath foiled the distemper, then comes the Do∣ctor to play both the fool and knave with his rules of Art, and prescribes his lenitives, & gentle purges, for fear lest the party should seem to recover without his help, & before this (while purges are too desperate) he deviseth a Clyster, which trade almost eve∣ry old wife hath got from him, who now a daies, can prescribe Clysters as confidently, and as wel as the Doctor. Here the Apothecary, who in this case is groom of the close stool, is as busie as a cut purse, on which score I heard of one, who had his holiday face and band spoy∣led by one of his Patients, for want of a better retentive faculty in his hinder parts: I could wish all poste∣rior-fumblers so served, to teach them a little more wit, while they pretend to so much judgement and skill. Purges then (and justly) we reject as dangerous febrile medicaments,
at some times, or rather desperate, alwaies (as purges) intended to the destruction, rather of the man, then of his disease, of which not without cause said the noble Helmont, Reus sim coram Deo, nisi prorsus suasero à purgantibus abstinendum. And as for Clysters, they are the silly Non plus ultra's of our Bum∣prognosticators, a dotage that it is enough to name it, when to wit, the Doctor by his information, findes a distemper in the head, stomack, spleen, or kidneys, of the sick or ill affected Patient, he by his profound Art findes out this remedy: The Apothecary is ordered to make a caudle for the Arse-gut, this luke∣warm is tyed up in a bladder, not without some superstition, for fear some wind be tyed up with the li∣quor, and so through a small pipe it is conveyed up at the fundament, with promise in some cases of won∣derful effects. O brave Doctors! O
sweet Method! This, O this! is one of the main pillars of your ado∣red method, and as universal a pre∣scription as any next to diet, to which it is is not inferior for its com∣mon and general application, whence you may worthily be stiled the Gly∣ster-pipe family or tribe. In defence of Purgatives, I know much may and will be said, and that partly from experience, and partly from the writing of the Adepti; I shall therefore not pass over that, be∣cause many ingenious men may be concerned in the Resolution of it. And first for the Arcanum Coralli∣num, which is Paracelsus Diacelta∣tesson, and is Mercury precipitated by mean of the Liquor Alchahest, and corallated by the water of whites of Egges, and is purgative by siege, and a most certain cure for all Feavers, Agues, Pleuresies, &c. yea the Hectique it perfectly restores, as al∣so Dropsies, with all Ulcers inward
and outward, and the venereal di∣stemper, with the Gout, &c. and its operation is purgative, and that cer∣tainly and constantly, so long only as the patient is ill, and no longer. To which I answer, that first it cures not (qatenus purging by siege) for the Horizontal gold, which is the same essentially with the Mercu∣ry corallated, cures all the foremen∣tioned distempers yet without pur∣gation by stool, and the same doth the Ladanum or sweet oyle of Mercury (which is Helmont and Paracelsus true Ladanum without Opium) which is only Mercury cohobated so oft and long by that fiery liquor, till it be all made volatile, and then the sweet oyle or tincture of the Sulphur separated from the central Mercury, is the Ladanum of Mercury curing universally all diseases (in tono uni∣sono) as Helmont speaks, yet without purging by siege. So then this pur∣gative virtue that is in this, (Coral∣latum
Mercurii) is a specifick power given to it from God, by which it looseth the belly, not promiscuously, but only to sick parties, and that on∣ly so long as the disease remains, but it is not on that score that it cures the Gout, Pox, &c. but by virtue of its resolutive power, by which it pe∣netrates all the digestions which are capable of excrements, & resolves all preternatural Coagulation, in what place soever it is, as also all extrave∣nated bloud, which after by a pe∣culiar priviledge, it causeth to be ex∣pelled by stool, and sometimes by vo∣mit, which is accidental to the cure. The same may be said of an Anti∣monial Panacaea, which I know and is a certain cure for Agues, Feavers, and Pleuresie, and is only purgative by siege; for obtaining which, ma∣ny that I am acquainted with have been long courting Nature in vain, the effect of curing such and such diseases is not to be attributed to the
purgative quality, but that is an ac∣dent following the effect of cure, not necessarily as its cause; for the pur∣gative virtue may be taken away in this Panacaea, and it made an insen∣sible Diaphoretick with no less suc∣cess, (rather greater) then while it had a solutive virtue. Yet here by the way take notice of a true or right Purge, it is not like to Scammony, Colocynthida, Jalap, &c. which (intuitu veneni) work promis∣cuously on all that shall take them (diseased or no) for a true Purge, of which a Son of Art need not be asha∣med, will never purge ought from a sound body, but work only on such as are diseased, and that only so long as the disease lasts; such is the Diaceltatesson of Paracelsus, and such is this Panacaea of Antimony of which I now speak. Now as concerning the purging vegetable poysons, commonly known by the name of Purges, their
name contains a meer imposture, and their manner of working deceives many (and those learned and ingeni∣ous) men. For they by their fermental viru∣lency do infect the bowels, which be∣ing sensible of their hostility, do weep forth their nutritive moisture, together with the Latex (alwaies at command on such an occasion) which receiving the venemous impression, are by the heat of the body cada∣verated, and cast forth in various colours, according as the nature of the poyson is. This with gripings of the bowels, and a nauseous sickness at the stomack, is the effect of the commonly named purges, or rather poysons (for so they are indeed) and this is a main pillar of the pompous fabrick of the Galenists so adored Method. For it is natural, not only to the bowels, but to all the exquisitely sensible parts, if offended to weep
forth a large quantity of moisture, to wash away that character or im∣pression made, as the eyes by smoke, the nose by sternutatories, the mouth by Pellitory, and so the stomack and bowels by Asarum, Colocyn∣thida, Jalap, &c. which moisture is partly the Latex (ready at call) and partly the alimentary humour of the part offended, and the judgement gi∣ven upon the excrements so rejected, is as sottish as if a man should throw pepper or salt into a mans eyes, and then bless himself to see how they water, which if let alone would have been well enough. So that the matter cast forth by excrement, is not what was before in the body, but what was at the time made by the poyson; and if ought chance to be avoided which was be∣fore excrementitious, it is by meer accident, it being the nature of the poyson given, to work only on what is vital, with which if ought that
was offensive be cast out, let not the Doctor boast of that, for being but accidental, and so hazardable, so great mischief as is threatned by gi∣ving poyson into the body, is not to be adventured, in hopes of a casual good. But moreover I shall give the stu∣dious Reader to understand, that in many vegetable Simples under the mask of virulency, great and noble virtues are hidden, which are kept by the poysonous appearance from rash hands, as the apples of the He∣sperides were feigned to be kept by a watchful Dragon; or as the pas∣sage to the Tree of life, was guarded by a flaming sword in the hand of Cherubims. Thus in Hellebore under the chur∣lish vomitive poyson caused with convulsion both of stomach and nerves, is hidden a most noble re∣medy against Hypocondriack melan∣choly, the Gout, Epilepsie, Convul∣sions,
and quartain or third day Ague, which so baffles Physicians, that it is grown to a proverb, Quartanam nescit medicus propellere febrim. So in Colocynthida under the la∣xative venome is hidden an excellent febrifuge: so in Asarum roots, a gen∣tle remedy for slow lingring Fea∣vers; and so I could instance in Opi∣um and many other Simples. But he that thinks that the vomi∣tive, laxative, or deleterial qualities in these simples, are the effective causes of the good done by them, is mistaken, but they are only as a clog to a mastiffe, or as a sheath to a sharp sword, by which their excel∣lency is not only held back, but also notably perverted by this dangerous companion, insomuch that nature ab∣horring the malignant virulency, doth not admit oft times of the remedy
although sometimes in strong consti∣tutions, where the poyson cannot make that impression, which in wea∣ker bodies it would, the vertue of the concrete through the cloud of its ve∣nome, doth yeeld some irradiation of its specifick benignity, to the ex∣tinguishing a disease, which through Gods mercy sometimes fals out, but little to the Doctors credit, who gives the bad with the good, being penally blinded with ignorance, only by means of pride and sloth. What is said of purges or laxa∣tives, may in their kinde be said of Vomits, which (quatenus talia) in∣tend only a violence to nature, which sensible of their hostility, rages and cals for help as I may say, from its neighbours (that is the Latex, and the alimentary humour of the part affected) which are oft time prodi∣gally spent, sometimes by vomit, sometimes by siege, sometimes both waies, to wash away that odious cha∣racter
impressed, mangre which dili∣gence of the Archeus, the impression sometimes perseveres till death, which is effectively caused by this Medicine (falsly so called, being tru∣ly the reall poyson) while the poor butchered Patient thinking to have a disease only purged away, loseth his life, either by an obstinate vomi∣ting, or an unconquerable loosness. Thus the other day I heard of one in Fleetstreet a lusty man, who for some distemper took a purge, which (when it was thought it had done working) had left such a venemous tincture in the bowels, as was not washed away with fewer then about three hundred stools, in about three daies time, and so he had like to paid for the Doctors folly with the price of his life, besides his money. Yet this must be a brave Art, and he that cannot do thus in conscience, must (ipso facto) be termed an Emperick and Mountebank.
To conclude this venomous vomi∣ing and laxative subject, we yeeld, that vomits and purges (as such) may by accident remove a distem∣per, inasmuch as they inrage the Ar∣cheus, by their venome, which grow∣ing mad by reason of so odious a guest, rages to and fro without order or reason, falling out with what ever comes in the way, and (as in case of a fire in the City, the Pipes are broke up) so here the next alimentary moi∣sture is made use of to blot out this incture of venom, the stomack turned up & down, the bowels torn and gri∣ped for mosture, and in this general urly burly, perhaps something that before was offensive, is cast out, and thus is the devil cast out as it were by Beelzebub, or as if a man should rid his breath of the smell of Onions by eating garlick: this is the myste∣ry of the Galenists, which is little better then the mystery of ini∣quity.
A Patient is troubled perhaps with an Ague, and the Doctor in the first place (some I am sure do) or∣ders bloud-letting, that is, by striking a terror into the Archeus, through loss of the bloud, which threatens, and strikes at the root of life, indea∣vouring to cause it to leave its rage, (which sometimes it doth on the score of terrefaction) but if this pre∣vail not, then is either a vomitive or laxative poyson given inwardly (un∣der the imposed name of a medicine) and by this the Archeus is brought as we may say (adrestim) and enfor∣forced to play one game for life and all, hoping that in this commo∣tion that is made, the Archeus with the poyson, may cast out what be∣fore inraged it, and by being put in∣to a greater danger, may forget or neglect what before provoked it to fury; as a man in imminent danger of his life, will forget or neglect the loss of his goods, which otherwise
would trouble him sufficiently. I ap∣peal to all ingenious men, if this be not a notable performance, and yet it is the whole of the Doctors craft; besides which he hath nothing but Juleps, and Lozenges, and such trin∣kets, of which every Confectioner and curious huswife is better stored then he. Whose method waves still from one extreme to another their potions, and doses (which they call Physick) being so cursedly loathsom, as if they were made to poyson Cerberus, insomuch that the sight of many purging potions is enough to make most men and women vomit, to sweeten which, their method stores them with cordial fopperies, of which may truly be said that of the Poet, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici? Syrups of Clove gelly-flowers,
with all sorts of Conserves, and Pre∣serves, Marmalads, Quiddenies, and the like are of this list, which with Diascordium, Methridate, Alcher∣mes, and Theriacle, distilled wa∣ters, and the like, serve (if to nothing else) yet to multiply the Doctors Fees, and to enlarge the Apotheca∣ries Bils, and that is enough for them who care for nothing else. Well then, if this be not the way of curing diseases, what is? may a studious and ingenious Reader ask of me: I have hinted it before, and shall more fully insist upon it: I say adaequate remedies are to be studied for the cure of diseases, and by stu∣dy they are to be found, such I mean, which will be to the extinguishing a disease, as water will quench fire. And this I shall be bold to adde, that all the tricks that are used by the Galenists, (as they say according to their Method) viz. Bleeding, Vesi∣cations, Scarifications, Fontinels,
Cauteries, Diaetical prescriptions, &c. are but silly poor shifts analo∣gical to Adams fig-leaves to hide his nakedness: childish fopperies to de∣ceive their abused Patients, and to make themselves appear diligent (cu∣rando) while they want adaequate re∣medies that might be (morbum me∣dendo:) therefore my brethren, as many of you as will be (medici) and not (curatores) study and you will attain such Medicines as will get you both credit and honor, as also gain, and honest rewards from your Pa∣tients. God hath not been wanting in bounty, if you will not be wanting in diligence: all his works are mer∣cy and truth, and according to these attributes are the Medicines by him created and appointed, they are mer∣ciful remedies, which will restore, not cruel drugs, which will only torment the body, and rob the sick party of their money, and sometimes their lives, they are true Medicines, which
will actually perform what the Pati∣ent expects, and the Physician pro∣miseth, and not faithless remedies, which are only like a broken staffe not only to cause him that leans on it to fall, but also to hurt him with its splinters, this is the difference be∣tween those which I commend, and the common medicines. And as I instanced in the Feaver, so in this discovery of Medicines, I shall have eye to that instance, which is indeed a true touchstone to try any Physician by, continual Feavers be∣ing analogical to the most violent spontaneously transient disease, and the Quartan being analogical to the most obstinate Chronical disease, (especially if Autumnal, and Hye∣mal) insomuch that a medicine that will cure all Feavers, continual and intermittent, at all seasons of the year, even in the weakest constituti∣ons, yea although Hectical, will with the like ease cure all Chronick dis∣eases.
Such affinity is between the Feaver and the Gout, that the latter is never without the former, a sen∣sible Febricula either preceding or accompanying any rigorous Paro∣xysme of the Gout; and few malig∣nant Feavers, without pain in the head, back, or limbs, which is analo∣logicall to the pain of the Gout. And indeed what are all diseases, but so many and distinct furies of one and the same Archeus, which is variously provoked, according to the varieties of the occasionate peccant matter, or impressed Ideall chara∣cter, on any of the viscera, from whence by irradiation of the anger of the Archeus, various parts are variously tormented, as the acciden∣tall occasionate matter shall give di∣stinction. Therefore the highest and noblest way of medicine, is by pacifying the Archeus, to bring it to absolute quiet and rest, whereby it neglects
that provocation by which it was incensed, and so the furious Idea being totally blotted out, it repents (as it were) of its former madnesse, and so Nature disposeth of the ex∣crementitious product insensibly. The preserving therefore in health, consists not in taking of poyson, to the end the Archeus, being another way more enraged, by an eminent danger immediately threatning the life, may be put into a hurly burly, in hopes that its fu∣ry, with the poyson taken, it may throw out what ever was peccant before, but in keeping it from fury and rage if not already provoked, or otherwise appeasing it. And I appeal to all ingenious men, which of the two is the better method. But this is the height of medicine, and is performable by the glorified, spirituated, and perfected Sulphurs, which by their eminent purity and perfection, and by their fermentall
irradiation, at once mortifie what∣ever is malignant in the body, by which the Archeus finding such powerfull assistance, begins to repent of its madnesse, that it should so disquiet it self and its whole habi∣tation, about a thing so quickly ma∣stered, and with the joy and jubile conceived upon its spedy help found, it cheers up all its parts, which seem revived, as the earth when after winter it begins to smile with buddes and flowers, and so the strength that a while before seemed decayed, appears in short time renued, this is the noble effect of these (truly Astral) medicines. But to such who cannot attain to this height of Art, (as truly all are not elected hereto) I shal advise other (more easily attainable) medicines, lest I should seem only to desire to Tantalize, and not really to benefit and profit the Reader.
The noble Helmont on such a question propounded, that if by purgations and by vomits, cures are not to be expected, how then they may be performed; makes this an∣swer to his own question, to wit, that the ends are to be promoted. If saith he, any filth be in the first rooms or places of digestion, then Abstersives only are to be used, Na∣ture easily and very safely perform∣ing the rest. But if any filth be lodged more deeply, then volatile Alcalies are to be used, which cleanse the the body throughly, just as Sope cleanseth Linnen. The same advice I give to such as would be∣come true Sonnes of Art. There are noble Arcana's in Na∣ture preparable by the great Dissol∣vent, the liquor Alchahest, which are not for every one to command; although the liquor when prepared be of infinite vertue, yet would  not advise a young Artist so to dote
on that search, as to neglect more easily attainable secrets, especially, fince by succedaneous secrets the same diseases may be restored, al∣though not with the same speed or universality, (one of the grand Arca∣na's curing equally all diseases) yet in a little more time, and with greater care, as certainly. I shall therefore here not speak of any Alchahesticall preparations, that liquor being difficult to prepare, and rarely possessed, but shall come to the succedaneous Keyes of this Art, which any ingenious man may with industry (with Gods blessing) easily attain. Although I must ingenuously pro∣fesse that my mind was so fired with eagernesse after that secret, that I did for nigh ten years make it my main search, which so soon as I knew, and could prepare, my spirit was straightway so satisfied with the knowledge thereof, that I never hitherto prepared it.
For the way as I made it was very tedious, and it in making and using subject to chances, so that although it be (when made) incorruptible, yet the breaking of one Glasse will lose that which otherwise is immortall, nor can it well be used without ac∣curate furnaces both for digestion and distillation, which required to the preparation of medicaments which are to be obtained there∣by. Of this Subject I have spoken largely in a peculiar Treatise on that only Liquor, and in another Trea∣tise, entituled, The Art of Pyrotech∣ny opened and discovered; and in a Treatise entituled, Truth asserted and maintained, or a Chymicall and Phi∣losophicall resolution of certain que∣stions sent me by one veyling him∣self under the name of Philalethes Zeteticus. All which Tractates I purpose speedily to send abroad, so soon as I find what entertainment
this Tractate will find in the World. To which Arcanum if you cannot attain, learn saith Helmont to make Alcalies volatile, that by mean of them you may perfect or make your solutions of Bodies. For fixed Alcalies according to Helmont's Doctrine are of wonder∣full vertues, insomuch that he equals them in vertue to the great Arca∣na's, as being so penetrative, that wherever they will not reach, no∣thing else will: whose Doctrine I shall not repeat, but rather illustrate. Nor shall I here speak but only briefly of this Subject, having in a peculiar Treatise entituled, de myste∣riis Alcalium, spoken largely of the same, to which (as which I intend speedily to make publike) I shall re∣mit the studious Reader for full sa∣tisfaction. However I shall in this place dis∣cover so much (though very briefly) as may serve for direction to him
that is industrious, by what he shall find here, to unlock many secrets of Nature, and those very noble as to the Philosophy of them, and usefull as to the application of them unto mankind. Know then that Alcalyes are the the fixt Salts of combustible Con∣cretes, fixed by the activity of the fire, which were (before burning) volatile, and meerly fixed in this act of conflagration. In these Salts the seminal vertue is totally extinct, (which is the proper operation of the fire, on whatsoever it can master and overcome) so that they have on∣ly a Saline, Diuretick and abstersive vertue, which withall from the fire borrowes a fiery corrosive quality, in which respect it contains a little hostility and reluctancy toward the stomack. Truth, I know many Chymists ac∣cording to the sentence of Quercetan, do hold that the seminal principles
are kept and preserved uncorrupt in the fire, but I rather lean to the contrary judgement of Helmont, which experience hath often and sa∣tisfactority convinced me of. I grant that Alcalies do differ one from the other (per genera & species) since the operation of each Agent is received by the Patient (per mo∣dum recipientis) and so the uniform Act of burning in stones produceth one sort of Calx or Alcaly, in Oyster-shells another, in Trees a∣nother, in Herbs &c. another, and yet this distinction doth not lie in the formal, seminal, Balsamick qua∣lities of the Concrete, but in ano∣ther quality, or other qualities, which are determined by the speci∣ficated forms, although themselves in this act of determination expire, and leave the Salt, as to the first Al∣calizate intention of kinne to all o∣ther Salts, that are made effectively by Vulcan, yet distinguished from all
others according to the capability of reception of the Agents activity in the Patient, whose specificated form gave the Alcaly a certain distinction in determination, although to its own extinguishment. All then that remains in the Alca∣li of the former Concrete, is but a very sleight modicum of the mag∣numoportet, and so Alcalies do dif∣fer each from other, although all of them in their primary intention, are of one and the same nature and qualities. Hence it is that the Alca∣ly of Tartar hath deserved and got∣ten the name of Respub. Alcalium; since whatever vertue is to be found in any Alcaly, may be found in and demonstrated from the Alcali of Tartar. For the fire having no seminal power, it makes what proceeds from it effectively, though not efficiently, for the Salt to speak Philosophical∣ly, doth in this act of Vulcan's fury,
lay hold on its neighbouring Sul∣phur, and both being before vola∣tile, they of their own accord melt together into a Salt, and so fix them∣selves into an Alcalizate Body. Hence it is that Alcalies are easi∣ly volatized, since their generation proceeds not from seminal begin∣nings, but is a spontaneous Larva, which part of the Salt and Sulphur of the Concrete assume, the better to withstand Vulcans fury, as Mercury by bare circulation in the fire, will spontaneously assume the larva of a red (and somewhat fixed) Precipi∣tate. This is the processe of this Ano∣malous Generation; yet is the pro∣duct very noble, if especially this fixed body be by art brought back again to a volatile substance. Which is to be done very suc∣cessefully by mean of vegetable es∣sentiall Sulphurs (that is distilled Oyls) to which Alcalies have a very
neer, nay an intimate affinity, which may appear first, by the unctuous slipperinesse of Alcalies. Secondly, by their ready mixture with any ex∣pressed Oyl, between both which is made a Sope, being a neuter from both. Thirdly, by the greedy mix∣ture of them with Sulphurs minerall, which are known to be unctuous, and of neer kin to Oyls. Alcalies being thus volatized, become noble medicines, and of ex∣cellent use both in their own nature, and to the making of other prepa∣rations, of which I shall touch briefly, and so draw toward a conclusion. Concerning this operation, Hel∣mont hath given more light then a∣ny that went before him, yet hath he written darkly enough, (although wondrous Philosophically) which as many as understand him with me, will confesse. I must seriously professe, that for nigh seven years I made about two
thousand experiments to this intent, but was alwayes unsuccessefull, till pondering the words of that old Phi∣losopher concerning this Subject, I found my errors and the truth like∣wise. And I do suppose that scarce the hundredth Artist will attain this secret, unlesse it be from him only who is the giver of every good and perfect gift, to whom alone be all glory and everlasting benediction. For it is a rare thing to have any of these secrets communicated in form of receipts, or if communica∣ted, yet so that much be left out in the direction, which, without pains, study, and sedulity will never be attained, so I did, and so all have done, who have been masters of secrets, and so I advice each desirous student in this Art to do. And for the help of such, I shall be as candid, as the Lawes of this art wil permit and allow.
Now forasmuch as I have under∣taken the vindication of noble Hel∣mont, and the explication of Nature according to those principles which eperience in the fire had taught him, I shall from my own experience also further illustrate what was obscure∣ly laid down by him, in reference to the preparation of noble medica∣ments. And as the fire taught Helmont to understand Paracelsus, so it hath also taught me to understand them both, and by it must every one that would understand Nature truely, and not notionally, have his Philosophy regenerated. Concerning Alcalies, the noble Helmont saith, that being volatized, they equall the vertue of the most noble Arcana's, inasmuch as being indued with an abstersive and reso∣lutive vertue, they passe even to the fourth digestion, and resolve all pre∣ternaturall excrements and coagula∣tions
in all the Vessels. That they take away all filthy residence, which is in any of the veins, and that they do resolve all (though never so ob∣stinate) obstructions, and so cut off the materiall cause of all apostema∣tions, and ulcers both within and without. That their spirit is so penetrative, and efficacious, that whithersoever it will not reach, no∣thing else will. And in a word, that as Sope cleanseth linnen, so they cleanse the whole body, and cut off, and cleanse away the material cause of all diseases. Their spirit is of an admirable dissolving quality, insomuch that it will dissolve any simple Concrete Body, and dissolving will be coagu∣lated upon it, and borrow from the dissolved Body a specificated vertue, which having entrance into the Bo∣dy, will actually cure deplorable and chronick diseases, as well as all Feavers.
This is the summe of his Doctrine concerning Alcalies, which is very true, and in which I can be a faith∣full witnesse with him, that he hath born true testimony unto Nature. Of which operation be gives some hints in two or thee places, one, where speaking of the Oyl of Cina∣mon, how it may be made into Salt, he saith, that if that Oyl be mixed with its own Alcali, without any water, being circulated three moneths with an occult and secret circulati∣on, it is wholly turned into a vola∣tile Salt; of which elsewhere he saith, that it is a noble remedy for the Palsy, Epilepsy, &c. And in another place, where he teacheth (in defect of the Alcha∣hesticall preparation) to sever the Sulphur from Paracelsus Metallus masculus (that is Spelter, and is the Sulphur Glaure Augurelli) and to cohobate it with Oyl of Mace, Anise, or Therebinth, till it all come over
the Helm in a fetid Oyl, and then to circulate it with an Alcali (as it ought to be) till it be turned into an Elixir of volatile Salt, and after to take away its fetor by rectifying it with good Spirit of Wine, this he commends, and justly, for a cure of very many (if not most, or all) chro∣nicall diseases. For explication of which Do∣ctrine, let me admonish the Reader, that Salt of Tartar, or any Alcali, may be made severall wayes volatile, and each way yeelding noble medi∣caments, yet one way far nobler then other. Now of all wayes, that is the most inferiour, which is done by Oyls, as Helmont well notes, that of all Salts, those are most languid which contain the vita media of Sul∣phurs, which he calls (Sulphurum rosapiam) cap. 3. de Duelech, and therefore these Elixirs do follow the name of the Oyl by which they are
made, and are called Sal volatile, or Elixir volatile, Cinamoni, Macis, Nucis Myristicae, Therebinthinae, &c. according as the Oyls are by which the Alcali is made fugitive, and though they are noble medicines, yet are they Specificks subordinate much to universall Arcana's, to which Helmont equalls, and that justly the Spirits of Salt of Tartar, which are by a far more secret Ar preparable. Such are the volatile Salts made of Cephalike Herbs, as Rosemary Sage, &c. which are commended by that Philosopher only, as parti∣cular remedies in Feavers, yet such that if given in due time before th fit, in intermittents, on a fasting stomach, or at any time in continua Feavers, and sweat be provoked they will never put a faithfull Physi∣tian to derision. Therefore I give all ingenuou Artists to understand, that Alcalie
are noble Bodies, ordained by God for great uses to mankind, and may be handled as the artist pleaseth. Many simple Mechanists know o take Oyl expressed, and with the ixivium of Alcalies to boyl it into  Sope, which is a (Tertium neu∣rum) from both the Oyl and the Alcali. But when they have done his, they know not how to pro∣ceed further with it, nor do our mo∣ern Philosophers, although they hink themselves wise men. This is the lowest and most infe∣our way of preparing Salts, viz. ith exprest Oyls which contain uch heterogeneity in them, and re full of fuliginous vapours, (as ay appear by their speedy growing ancid, especially if once heated) yet otwithstanding, in their union with Alcalies, there may be much of hilosophy learned, if it were but uly considered, and the effect pon∣ered with its causes. Yet this I must
say, that though the making of Sope be the utmost of the Sope-boylers work, it is but the first step of the Philosophers work, and indeed is but an Abortive in Philosophy, cau∣sed by violent decoction, by which the Oyl and the Salt enter each o∣ther in some measure, but do not radically penetrate each others pro∣fundity, as I shall by instance make to appear. For let the best Sope be distilled, with an acute water stinking of an Empyreum, will distill of an high coloured fetid Oyl, of a greenish ceruleous colour to view in a glasse. The Caput mortuum being elixated by warm water will give an Alcali, fixed as before (though giving an high coloured Lixivium) but the quantity both of Salt and Oyl, less then what was taken to make the Sope, and therefore considerable part of both, in this decoction into Sope, are turned into an Aqueous
Liquor, which being redistilled, ac∣cording to Helmont's prescription, from a fixt body, becomes insipid like to elemen all water, leaving the volatile Salt that was in the Spirit coagulated upon the fixt Body. By which it is evident that the Oyl and Salt had not ingresse to each others profundity, and therefore part of each are separable from the other, the Salt in its Alcalizate, and the Oyl in its unctuous nature: by which may be concluded, that a centrall ingression was not made of each into other. But as for essentiall or distilled Oyls, as of Therebinth, Mace, Nutmeg, &c. they by reason of their volatility, not abiding deco∣ction, are with difficulty made into a Sapo, although by Cohobation upon a Lixivium, they will yeeld a Collostrum like to Tarre in colour, which will have the whole taste and smell of the Concrete, and the
Oyl that distills over will be of lit∣tle vertue, being thus robbed of its specifick odor and taste, this Col∣lostrum will dissolve (in part) either in water or spirit of Wine, leaving part that will not dissolve, much like to Shoo-makers waxe: of this operation some make a secret, but it is only triviall, for though by it dissolved in Spirit of Wine, a good medicine may be made against wind in the stomack, yet it is not the Elixir of volatile Tartar, but a certain substance of the Oyl made by the fretting of the Lixivium in decoction, and swims upon the Lixivium, nor will be made by any industry to mixe with it; the Lixivi∣um then is highly tincted, and possi∣bly by long cohobation there might be made an union, but my patience would never suffer me to persist to see the utmost of that operation, especially when I knew a better way.
For to be ingenuous, I tryed se∣verall wayes in pursuance of volatile Alcalies, which upon Helmont's commendation, and Paracelsus also, I highly valued, and next to the great Dissolvent made them my search, which I assayed to make se∣verall wayes, which would be tedious here to tell of. 'Tis enough for the Reader, that he know that it is not sufficient for him to be able to make a Sapo with Salts and Oyls, for that is easie in exprest, harder in distilled Oyls, and at the best but trivial, forasmuch as the best Sapo, being distilled by a graduall fire, will give, besides a Spirit smelling of an Empyreum, an Oyl of a strong sent, and a Salt (in the caput mortuum) Alcalizate and fixt, which shews that this operation is but an abortive birth in Philo∣sophy, nor is the spirit thus got by distillation that noble spirit of Tar∣tar, of which Helmont and Paracel∣sus
glory, but it is a spirit, in which is very little of the nature of the Al∣cali, and that but very languid, the nobler parts of both Oyl and Salts, being for want of union each with other, separable in their former na∣ture, and qualities. There is therefore a way far more secret, by which is made not a Sa∣po, but a Salt in form of Sugar∣candy, liquable in water or Wine, and volatile, in which are these no∣table and very remarkable things. First, that one part of Alcali will turn two or three parts of Oyl into meer Salt, without any the least ole∣aginity, save only a very small por∣tion of the Oyl will be turned into a resinous gumme, distinct from that which is salificate. 2. This dissolves in a liquor, not as Sope, which makes a troubled suddy water, but as any other Salt. 3. This being boyled to a Cuti∣cle, will shoot like to any other
Salt, tincted according to the Con∣cretes colour. 4. The sharpnesse of the Salt is totally mortified, and it becomes so mild, as not to offend the mouth, though taken alone. 5. The Oyls, though hot and of a very acute taste, yet they retain only so much taste and smell, as is inseparable from the vita media, so that the medicine is temperate, di∣retick, and insensibly Diaphoretick. 6. This Salt thus made is totally volatile, without leaving any fixed Salt in the Caput mortuum. 7. This may be done perfectly in ten weeks or lesse, in very great quantity, provided it be according to Helmont's order, done (sine aquâ, occultâ & artificiosâ circulatione) or to speak plainly, that the digestion be made (in centro profunditatis ma∣terae.) 8. The heat required ought ne∣ver to exceed the heat of the Sunne
in the Spring, that is according to the manner of Helmont's Essences, in which heat alone, by Art, the Salt receiveth a fermentall determination from the Oyls, and they on the other hand receive the same from the Salt, and so is made of both a volatile temperate Salt, of the vertue of each parent. For from the Alcali, it receives a vertue Diuretick and ab∣stersive, and from the Oyl a Balsa∣mick Nature, by which it reacheth even unto our Constitutive princi∣ples, and in the way resolves what∣ever preternaturall coagulation it meets withall. 9. This Salt thus elixerate is vo∣latile so, as that it may be dissolved in water, and boyled up again with∣out losse of vertue, in manner of Cremor Tartari, Sal Ammoniack, Sugar, Sugar-Candy, &c. 10. By this means the Sulphur of any metall or minerall (that may be separated from the Mercuriality and
distilled with Oyls essentiall over the helm) may be made into the form of an essentiall Salt; and that by being rectified with spirit of Wine (or with clean water) will lose its strong odor, and thus may be obtained a Medicine for most (or all) Chroni∣call diseases. 11. This Elixir thus made, con∣tains a communicable ferment to any other Herb, which being di∣gested with it (dissolved in Wine) is by it turned into a volatile Salt, (except only the Faeces of the true vertue of the Concrete.) 12. This Elixir is an absolute Corrector of the venome in all ve∣getables, which it mortifies imme∣diately, insomuch that Hellebore, Aconitum, Hyosciam, Elaterium, &c. by bare mixing with this Elixir of volatile Tartar, become gentle suddenly, and this done, without any heat stronger then for the hatch∣ing of an Egge, and by this Elixir
in a short (but very artificiall) deco∣ction may be made volatile Salts of such Herbs, which will not yeeld an Oyl by distilling with water, that is an essentiall Oyl, such as Hellebore, Jalap, Briony, Enula Campana, &c. which are noble Medicines thus corrected, having besides their own excellency the uni∣ted vertue of the Elixit, which a∣lone is a balsamicall Ens of admira∣ble efficacy in deplorable cases. Whoever then thou art that wouldest be a true Sonne of Art, learn to use Salts according to the true Philosophicall preparation of them, not as the foolish sort of Chy∣mists do, by giving them as they are extracted out of their ashes, thinking no other work to belong to them, then by repeated filtration to make them as crystalline and pure as may be; for although they are noble Subjects, yet their Lixiviate Acrimony is somewhat hostile, and
besides this they are unable in their fixt corporeous nature to passe be∣yond the Vessels of the second di∣gestion, and are cast forth by siege partly, but chiefly by urine. But being volatized, they become balsamical tinctures, and familiar to our natures, and so are easily ad∣mitted to have entrance even to our constitutive principles, (according to the nature of the Concrete, whose Crasis in its volatility it doth con∣tain) and in their passage they clear the Organs of all offensive excre∣ments, and by their gratefull odor they refresh the veins, and blot out all forain Idea's that are impressed on any of the viscera. Now among all fixed Salts, there is none of greater vertue then Salt of Tartar, whence it hath deserved to be called Alcalium Respublica, and among all Oyls there is none for its abstersive nature excells Oyl of The∣rebinth, which is a limpid Oyl, ex∣quisitely
quisitely penetrative, and of its own nature eminently diuretick. By means of this Oyl the Salt of Tartar is made into a volatile Elixir, Crystalline, very pure, and temperate, retaining so much tast and odor of the Therebinth as doth follow ne∣cessarily the vita media, so as that it may be barely distinguished, and that by an acute palate, this Elixir is mild without sharpnesse, crystalli∣zing like to any other Salt. And note, that in making this or any other Salt of an essentiall Oyl, when the digestion is compleat, and the Salt without the least oleaginity, will dissolve in water, that then the water which is first drawn off will seem a notable spirit, which yet is not the spirit of volatile Tartar; for that water being saved so long as the eminent taste remains, and when the Salt is nigh drie, put on it again, leaves all its tast behind, and is left insipid, and so at last distilled away
without taste, then is that Salt to be distilled or sublimed for the obtain∣ing of Helmont's noble spirit, by him and Paracelsus so highly commend∣ed. And thus courteous Reader, ima∣gining your self to be Master of these elixerated Oyls, and essencifi∣cated Salts (for all are made by one rule, and therefore learn one and learn all) you may desire to know what excellency is to be found in these beyond what is and may be seen in common medicines. To answer; first, the way of ma∣king the Salts is rather a common place then a single receipt, for make one, and make all the sorts of Essen∣tiall Salts, so that thus you may commend Salt of Cinnamon, Mace, Nutmeg, Cloves, &c. for the cu∣ring of the Palsy, Epilepsie, Con∣vulsions, and many other rigorous and Chronick diseases. But by first cohobating Sulphurs
of Antimony, metallus masculus, &c. with an Oyl, till they come over the Helm, and then circulating these Oyls with an Alcali into an essenti∣all Salt, will behad Medicines truly succedaneous to Alchahesticall Ar∣cana's. And thirdly, thus have you a Key by which you may enter the Closet of the most noble vegetable, sus∣pending its virulency, digesting its crudity, besides which there is no preparation comparable to that of the Liquor Alchahest, to which this is truly and may be adjudged succe∣daneous. But that is most solemn, to wit, when the whole Concrete is totally and perfectly reduced into a liquid form, with distinction of all its He∣terogeneities, in their severall colours, among which is alway one liquor, eminently distinguishable from the rest in colour, which is in substance but little, yet contains perfectly the
very Crasis of the Concrete: this is the highest of vegetable preparations, especially where the body is resolved in a gentle tepidity, and the Oyl (in such Concretes which yeeld Oyl) separated from the Mercuriall liquor, and both from the Dissolvent, and be after in the same heat decocted into a Salt, which is their first Ens. However, this preparation made by means of elixerated Salts and Oyls, although as to the Crasis of the ve∣getable, it advance it not to the dig∣nity of that Essence which is made by mean of the Alchahest, yet the medicaments thus made are no whit inferior in vertue, excelling them in generality of Energy. For the li∣quor Alchahest in its preparations is separated from the body dissolved, and so the Medicament expresseth only the vertue of the Concrete whence it was taken, which is more precise and singular, but here the E∣lixir of volatile Alcali, together with
the Balsamick tincture of the volati∣zing Oyl, is united with the Essence of the added Vegetable, (as for in∣stance, Hellebore, black or white, Asa∣rum, Opium, Zalap, &c.) whereby it is not only endowed with the speci∣fick endowments of the additionall Concrete, but also is ennobled by the admirable Abstersive, and in a man∣ner universall power of the afore∣said Elixir, by which it is enriched with most excellent medicinal quali∣ties, and becomes penetrative and in∣gressive as Balsamick and volatile, abstersive, resolutive, and diuretick, and gently Diaphoretick, as saline and Alcalizate, and besides this spe∣cifically intended and directed accor∣ding to the particular vertues of its other compounded simple, (out of which it forms a reall Salt, void of all virulency, without any losse of ver∣tue) by and from which it receives a more peculiar determination. For between the Oyls essentiall
and Salts Alcalizate, there is a fer∣mentall appetite, whereby they close each with other radically and in the Centrall profundity each of other, which give not a Sapo, nor a Col∣lostrum, (which are the triviall pro∣ducts of erring operators) but a reall Salt, mild without Corrosivenesse of the Alcali; and temperate without the heat of the Oyl, which then be∣ing of kin to Vegetalls, and thus fit∣ted to them, becomes a due and pro∣per Agent to salifie or bring to a Sacharine Salt any Vegetall with which it is mixed and Philosophical∣ly decocted, that is in a Solar heat or rather an animall warmth, wherein in about ten dayes or more as the quantity is, the whole substance will be transmuted into a reall Crystalli∣zing Salt, in which the media vita of the Concrete only remains, retaining the whole Crasis or vertue not in the least diminished, and so the efficacy of the Species or Concrete contracts
an intimate union with the Salt or Elixir of Tartar volatile, and both conspire to the performing of really wonderfull Cures. These tincted Crystalls if you put into pure spirit of Wine, and digest them in a gentle heat, the spirit by reaffusion, and powring off, as oft as it is tincted, will extract the whole tin∣cture of the Vegetable, leaving the Salt behind robbed of the tincture, by which it may be gathered that the Salt and the tincture are centrally di∣stinct, though they have centrally wrought each on other, yet not so as to contract an union each with other. The spirit of Wine then distilled off in a gentle heat, the tincture will remain, and is the whole Crasis of the Concrete, which is a noble pre∣paration for such Concretes, which are Balsamicall and odoriferous, where the tincture is desired free from the mixture of the Salts, as to wit, in such cases, where bare refresh∣ment
without Abstersion is desired and required. Thus is made the most noble A∣roph of Helmont out of Satyrion, and may be used either the tincture alone, separated from the Salt by ex∣traction with spirit of Wine, or mix∣ed with the Elixir, which I rather approve and choose, unlesse in case where the Back is to be strengthned in women afflicted with wasting, otherwise the Abstersivenesse of the Saline Elixir promotes the cure for the Nephritis and Stone, or gravell of the bladder, wonderfully. And now my decocting Apothe∣caries, where are you? Come in upon the Stage with your decoctions, Syrups, Electuaries, Lochsana's, Boles, and the rest of your Trinkets, and bring your Masters the Doctors with you to plead your cause and to mantain and defend you. The Doctors say of me that I am a Mountebank, and want method, and
I say of them, that they are Metho∣dists, and want Medicaments. Not that you want drugges or slops, you are confessed by all to have more then enough, but yet for all that, in com∣parison to true Medicaments, you have nothing that truly deserves to be named so. Blessed be God that I am igno∣rant when it is a fit time to let blood to preserve health, when to take it away to restore health, when to give poysons to purge, in expectation that Nature being forced to play a despe∣rate game, and reduced to a forc't put, may winne that by adventure, which you by all your Art cannot ascertain her with safe and speedy remedies. But this I know, namely, to cure those diseases by most cer∣tain, speedy, and safe Medicaments, which you by your method despair of. Your method only teacheth you when your medicaments are put to
a Non-plus, to have recourse to such things which my judgement disap∣proves, and therefore my Consci∣ence abhorres: my method teacheth me what diseases such and such Me∣dicines will restore, and where the disease is more deeply rooted and obstinate, it furnisheth me with more commanding Arcana's. If the peccant occasionall matter be only in the Concave of the first Vessels, as the stomack, Pylorus, Du∣odenum, &c. although the Symp∣tomes be never so violent, yet with Abstersive things I undertake the Cure, and perform it; such is the forenamed Elixir, either per se, or specificated with any Abstersive Simple. The most Abstersive Simple that I ever knew among the whole num∣ber of Vegetalls, is Opium, which of it self is a Narcotick deleteriall ve∣nome, but by means of this elixera∣ted Salt it loseth all those odious qua∣lities,
and is a most powerfull sudo∣rifick, anodynous eminently and cures all Feavers though never so acute, and all Agues, yea, although Quartans and Autumnall, which it helps by continued taking, in no long time. In the correction of which it is observable, that only a feculent sedi∣ment is separated, and the rest is total∣ly turned into a volatile Salt, which is not to be excelled in the whole ve∣getable Family. So corrected, it is most safely administred to the quan∣tity of 20 grains, & is so far from cau∣sing sleep compulsively, that it with∣holds from sleep, especially where the party affected is troubled with a Cough, but against a Cough it is so powerfull, that very well wrote Hel∣mont concerning it. Felicem illum Medicum qui novit lethalia ab Opi separare cum retentâ potestate agendi in Duumviratum. Happy is that Physitian who knowes how to sepa∣rate
the deadly qualities which are in Opium, so as that it may retain its ver∣tue of acting upon the Duumviratus. For this Simple thus corrected, by its innate specificated quality doth work on the seat of life, pacifying the Archeus without the least stupefacti∣on, but rather keeping the Patient awake, and provoking sweat either moderate or more strong, as the strength of the party is, and the ma∣lignity of the disease. Thus it extinguisheth all defluxi∣ons (called catarhs) and on that score is a certain remedy for fluxes, either bloudy, or not, all Coughs (not brought to their highest exasperati∣on, or most intimate rooting) in a word, it resolves by sweat and urine the cause of many diseases, which are not too deeply fixed, and where it will not reach, only a great Arcanum will. To be brief, many diseases, carry∣ing the face of an Ague, or the like
distemper, may sometimes be beyond this Medicines cure, yet even in such it will give ease, and where it will not throughly extinguish the malady, there let higher Arcana's be used. Of all Vegetable remedies correct∣ed, this only that I know works by vomit, which (with some only) it causeth the next day after its taking, I usually advising it after a very light supper to bedward last, (because it is Diaphoretick) and the next morning it causeth a spontaneous vomit, with little sicknesse or nauseousnesse. It binds the body for most part, and so not at all times to be admini∣stred, but with other advise added, to supply what is defective in it, 'tis sple∣netick in operation, and an admira∣ble remedy against wind in the sto∣mack or bowels, as also against Hy∣pochondriatick melancholy. The same way Hellebore correct∣ed is a noble remedy against lingring Quartans, and so I could instance in
very many Simples, but that time will not permit my enlargement here. Only this for a close I shall admo∣nish, that this Key being had, the noble Energy of all Vegetables will be at command without the least footsteps of virulency, and so a man may be his own experience (with very much safety) trie and satisfie himself, of what my experience will not per∣mit me to write, nor will my time allotted allow me to mention so far as my experience hath gone. And by the way as an admonition to our wise Masters of this science, I shall mind them, that in the whole Vegetable Family there is not a sim∣ple comparably so Diaphoretick as Opium, which they account of all Vegetables the most cold, in which let them learn from me, that the Narcotick virulency may be separa∣rated, without altering the specifick vertue in the least, and then it is ano∣dynous with much pleasure to the
Patient, and a help for great mala∣dies, giving ease and comfort in most, but prejudiciall in none, (save only an obstinate costivenesse) it being the specifick quality of that medicine to bind the belly, which it doth in most, yet so as to appear like a purge to some, but those very rarely. In Zalap, Rhabarb, and all purga∣tive Medicines so called (or rather vegetall poysons) it takes away the virulency totally, without the least remain of the same, and is then either Diaphoretick or Diuretick, or rather both, without any molestation to the Patient, and thus a certain remedy for all acute, and many Chronicall (not too highly graduated) maladies. If any then demand of me an ac∣count of my mystery and method, I answer: By the Symptomes I judge of the disease, and according to the strength of the Patient, and the rigor of the distemper I order my medi∣cines accordingly.
Acute diseases, and many Chro∣nicall not too highly graduated I cure by the Elixir of volatile Tartar alone, given in Wine, or else specifi∣cated with some Vegetable, as I see occasion. And with the blessing of God can promise the Patient cure to teir comfort, and perform it to my own credit. But where either the disease i oo high, or Nature too succumbent, there I volatize Sulphurs by essenti∣all Oyls, and make them into Elixirs, and after give them a specification from restorative aromatick Balsoms. And yet beyond this there is a way to make such a spirit of Tartar which is second to none but the great Dis∣solvent, of which I shall not speak here, having already transgressed the bounds prefixt to this Treatise, and besides in my other Treatise concer∣ning the Art of Pyrotechny, it is fully handled, and with as much can∣dor as can be expected.
I shall at present conclude, adi∣sing the Captious Reader either to mend what I have done, or to for∣bear his censure; and the studious Artist I shall advise to go on in is begun task with cheerfulnesse ad diligence; for true Medicine is a s∣rious and weighty matter, according to the Poet, —Facillo descensus Averni, Sed—superas evadere ad auras Hic labor hoc opus est.— FINIS.
