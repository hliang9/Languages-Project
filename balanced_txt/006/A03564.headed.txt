That is to haue euermo∣re his herte and his affeccyō vnto his cre∣ature / to seke knowlege of hym and of his ordenaunces / as wherfore he made the aungelles / ye man / the woman / maryage / paradyse / hell / & where they ben / and wherfore he wolde be borne of the vyr∣gyn Mary / and the whiche sygnyfyeth his dedes & his werkes▪ and also of the Antecryst and of the deed bodyes / and how a man sholde confesse hym and to whome. Now enquyre we than of his thynges as the dyscyples dothe the whiche demaundeth of his mayster / and the mayster answerynge vnto his de∣maundes as it foloweth.
¶ Here foloweth a lytel treatyse Intytuled or named ye Lucydary good and profytable for euery well dys∣posed persone the whiche hath wyll and affeccyon to knowe of noblesse spyrytuall. depiction of master and disciple the mayster. the discyple. MAster tel me what thyn∣ge is god. My chyl∣de he is a thyng spy¦rytuall in ye whiche is all dygnyte / and all perfeccyon / the whiche is knowyn∣ge all thynges / all myghtye / and euer¦more durynge with¦out ende / and with∣out begynnynge of another. and also he ne may be mesured ne comprehendid of man Inough for to se hym ne his beau∣tes / ne may be noumbred / nor his dygne puyssaūce / nor maye be taken of any maner entendement so mo∣che is he puyssaunt and grete. And also he is full of all bounte mercye and grace. ¶ Mayster may he be no moo but one onely god. My chylde / nay / For yf there were many goddes euery of them sholde be all puys∣saunt & than myght they make thynges contrary cō∣uenable yt one to ye other the whiche is ayenst nature dyuyne so yt he ne may be but one substantyue / & one essence dyuyne the whiche is pryncypall cause effy∣cyent
of all thynges and he is ye soueraygne god vn∣to the whiche euery herte desyreth to come the which entendement humayne ne maye comprehende ne I∣magen. ¶ Mayster wherfore is god called father. My chylde for the engendrement apperteyneth pryn¦cypally vnto the father more than vnto the mother / wherefore man sholde graunte vnto god the moost pryncypall partye. ¶ Mayster wherfore call we not the seconde parsone of the trynyte as well doughter as sone. My chylde for as moche as the sone is of mo¦re stronge nature / for he toke nature humayne in the fourme of man and not of woman. ¶ Mayster wher∣fore is not the holye goost called of the sone and the so∣ne were called mother. My chylde it is for that / that he procedeth and dyscendeth also pryncypally of the one as of the other. ¶ Mayster where was god befo∣re that he made the worlde. My chylde he was not in noo place corporell. For nothynge was but he all onely / but he was in hym selfe father and sone / & ho∣ly goost in one selfe essence. ¶ Mayster where is he now. My chylde god occupyeth no place. But his pu¦yssaunce infynyte is ouerall / for he gouerneth ye thyn¦ges the whiche ben in the oryent / and those ye whiche ben in the occydent / and generallye all the worlde / and therefore a man sayth that he is all tyme and all thynges. ¶ Mayster knoweth god all thynges. my chylde / ye: for in lykewyse as he is all puyssaunt also he is all knowynge and all seynge. ¶ Mayster in what maner made god the aungelles. my chylde he them made fayre & shynynge and without body and full of meruayelous bounte and saiges for to be his specyall mynystres. ¶ Mayster how synned the aun¦gels
that god had made to his semblaunce. My chyl¦de they yelded not graces vnto god of the grete grace and souerayne beaute that he had gyuē them / but en¦pryded thē ī mysknowynge of theyr creature. ¶ Ma∣ster what came of them. My chylde the moost greate maysters of them fell in to hell & ye other about vs / & the other in the ayre. ¶ Mayster wherfore dyscended they not all togethers in to hell. My chylde for that / that the one synned more greuously than the other so abyde they all aboute vs / and in the ayre for to proue the holy persones. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne redemed them Ihesu cryste as these men. My chylde for that that aungelles ben of more stronge mater & without body & lynned of theyr owne malyce and wyll wtout ony tēptacyon of other / & also for ye nature angelyke sholde conuerte theym one tyme alonely vnto good or vnto euyll / so that whan it is conuerted in to the one it may be conuertyd into the other by the which they neuer had done well. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne made he them that they myght not synne. My chylde to ye ende that by their meryte they sholde haue grace and glory in paradyse. ¶ Mayster whan god wyste that they sholde synne wherfore made he them. My chyld for to desteny the good frome the euyll / and to thende that the good be the moore confermed in bounte / as the paynter ye whiche soweth the blacke and of other euyll coloures amōge them that be fayre for to make them shewe the more fayre / and in this suffreth god the euyll amonge the good / & also god maketh the de∣uylles & hell for to execute and to punysshe the cursed and myserable synners of this worlde and he made paradyse and the aungelles for to gloryfye the good.
¶ Mayster knoweth the deuylles all thynges. My chylde of as moche as theyr nature is more spyrytu∣all than the nature of man / of as moche ben they the more subtyles and more sages / and knowen all thyn¦ges paste & p̄sent / but of thynges to come they know nothynge without it be by some cōiectures as in de∣faulte of the moone / and of suche semblables / but of thoughtes of the man they know nothynge / but god all onely. ¶ Mayster may they do what they wyll / My chylde they wyll not do no good / but they maye do moche yll / & not so moche as they wolde / but that that god theym suffreth lycenceth to do. ¶ Mayster the good aūgelles may they synne. My chylde whan the yll aūgelles fell from paradyse by theyr synne the good were in suche wyse confermed in good / that se∣then they haue wylled to doo none euyll. ¶ Mayster knowe they all thynges / & mayen they all. My chyl∣de they knowe as I tolde the ryght nowe of the cur∣syd aungelles & do that / that they wyll / at the wyll & commaūdemēt of god / for ayēst ye wyll of god they may do nothynge depiction of master and disciple ye discyple. ye mayster. MAyster wherfore dydde god make men and women. My chylde for to knowe hȳ and to loue hym / & for to fulfyll paradys and for to put theym in the places of theym in the places of the cursed aū∣gelles in paradyse / the whiche they haue lost
by theyr pryde & mysknowlege. ¶ Mayster wherof made god the man & the womā. My chylde he made them of the slyme of the erthe / and knowe thou that the body humayne is of the foure elementes ye which ben the erthe / the water / the ayre / and the fyre / so yt the flesshe answereth vnto erthe / the blode vnto the water / the wynde the ayre / and ye heete naturall vn∣to the fyre. And knowe thou also my chylde that the man is made vnto the semblaunce of the worlde / for as the skye hath two gretelyghtes the whiche ben ye sonne and the moone. Also the man hath two lyght is in his heed / the whiche ben the two eyen. And as the skaye hath .vij. planettes / In lykewyse hath ye man vij. partycyons in his heed. And as the see receyueth in it all thynges / In lykewyse the wombe of ye man receyueth in hit all thynges necessary vnto the lyfe of man. And the hardenesse of the stones answereth vn¦to the bones and vnto the nayles. And vnto the trees answereth the membres of his bodye. And vnto the grasse the heres. Knowe thou my chylde that the bo∣dye of the man is none other thynge but a tree ouer∣throwen hauynge ye rotes vpwarde / so that ye heeres ben the rotes / & the body is the stocke / and the armes & the legges ben the braūches. The whiche thynge sygnyfyeth that we sholde be enroted vpwarde in to heuen in ye loue of our creature. ¶ Mayster wherfore was the woman made of the syde of Adam more so∣ner than of ony other partye. My chylde yf the wo∣man had be made of the hyghest party of the mā she had ben to proude & sholde haue mystaken the man / And yf she had ben made of the moost lowest partye of the man / the man sholde haue to moche dyspray∣sed
her. wherfore she was fourmed of the myddle to thende that ye man her helde for his cōpany. ¶ May¦ster wherof made god the soule of the man & of ye wo∣man. My chylde he it create vnto his semblaunce / for the soule is also a substaunce spyrytuall hauynge en∣tendement / wyll / and remembraunce. ¶ Mayster made god the man and the woman with his owne hādes. My chylde he thē made all onely at his worde and commaundement. ¶ Mayster wherfore made god the man of so vyle mater. My chylde to the ende y• he were the more humble and to thende that the de∣uyll be the more confusyd seynge the man made of so vyse mater to be in paradyse from whens he is fallē by his pryde. ¶ Mayster wherfore made god the be∣stes. My chylde god hathe made the good beestes to thende that man be helped at his nede / and hath ma∣de the cursed and myscheuous for to abate the pryde of the man / for whan they noyen hym / he maye well thynke that he is a lytell thynge as of hymselfe whā he may not resyst them. Also there be made many be∣stes for to gyue vs exaumple to lyue as these antes / or pysmares / and spyders the whiche contynuallye trauayleth in theyr operacyons vnto the exaumple of whom we sholde euermore trauayle / and knowe that there is not any beest but that hath in him some marueylous nature whereof we sholde prayse god / and also we sholde take exaumple vnto theyr good cō∣dycyons as sayth ye holy scrypture that sayth thus. Respice volatiliaceli. &c. That is to saye beholde the byrdes of the skye the whiche ben purueyed of the purueyaunce of god / and haue no drede that god thē shall euer fayle / but lyue euermore in good hope in
synge god and in demaundynge of his mercye / whome we sholde take exaumple / and by reason we sholde do hyt more soner than the beestes that ne haue wittene vnderstandynge / seynge the grete gra¦ces that god vnto vs hath done the whiche ben ma∣de vnto his semblaunce and redemed wt his precyous blode / and the whiche gyueth vnto vs soo moche of good in this worlde. In suche wyse yt all the beestes plantes / trees / herbes / lande / & see / planettes / & star∣res / and all other thynges ben made for to serue vnto the man vnto his prouffyte and vtylyte / and yet he hathe lente vs the realme of paradyse yf we wyll / of the whiche ye leest glorye surmounteth all the Ioyes of this worlde. By the whiche my chylde the man is wele to blame the whyche mysknoweth his creature ye whiche somoche of grace to hym hath done seynge that the beestes the whiche ne haue wytte / ne vnder∣standynge / hym loue and thanke in demaundynge pyteously his ryghtdygne mercy. ¶ Mayster where was Adam create. My chylde he was create in ebrō & after was put in to paradyse terrester. ¶ Mayster what thȳge is in paradyse terrester / and where is it My chylde it is a place delectable in the oryont ouer ye mountaynes of egypt wherin ben trees of dyuerse vertues / and of suche there are that who so eteth of them he shall neuer haue hunger / and of other by na∣ture shall neuer dye. ¶ Mayster where was the wo∣man created. My chylde she was created in parady∣se terrestre / but the man was create wtout for be put wtin in possessyon. ¶ Mayster wherfore synned the man and the woman. My chylde by the decepcyon of the deuyl and by theyr folysshe thynkynge trespassed
the commaundement of god. ¶ Mayster whee it deceyued the deuyll them. My chylde / by enuy for  ye was full of sorowe of that that they sholde obtayne his place in paradyse ye whiche he had lost by his pry¦de. ¶ Mayster in what fourme tempted the ennemy theym. My chylde / the deuyll appered vnto them in the fourme of serpent tellynge them that yf they ete of that fruyte they sholde knowe as moche as god. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne created god the men confer∣med in grace as the aungelles. My chylde god wolde that the men were semblable vnto hym as all thyn∣ges to take of hym / god wolde that all were borne of Adam. ¶ Mayster why had he not made them that they myght not haue synned. My chylde to the ende that they had the more of meryte. ¶ Mayster howe had they engendred in paradyse terrestre. My chyld as thou sholdest put thyne one hande wtin thyn other without any delectacyon. ¶ Mayster how had these women chylded. My chylde wtout any doloure & ¦out ordure. ¶ Mayster how had they be in paradyse terrestre. My chylde as a generacyon gone one after the other. ¶ Mayster where is paradyse celestyall. My chylde it is in the tenth heuen the whiche is abo¦ue all the other heuens and is clepyd the heuyn Im∣peryall for as moche as it is more clere and more sub∣tyll in substaunce / & more fayre than all ye other / In the whiche bē the holy men & women of paradys en∣braced wt the loue of our lorde. ¶ Mayster wherfore made god man & woman whan he knewe well that they sholde trespace his commaundement. My chyld it was for his pleasure so to do for to shewe his infy∣nyte myght / and vnto the ende yt he were praysed ser∣ra
& honoured / for all thynges loue god in theyr be∣ge and also for they knewe well y• there shall be yet many persones of more gretter meryte & holynes as if they had not lytell synned / as saynt Iohan baptyst and ye apostles & dyscyples of our lorde & many other for as wytnessyth ye scripture ryght happy is he that may do yll / & dothe it not whan he maye. ¶ Mayster how longe abode Adam & Eue in paradys terrestre. My chylde frome the mornynge tyll vnto ye houre of noone / for at the .iij. houre Adam put the names in ye thynges / & about mydday they syn̄ed / & at none they were banysshed / & at suche houre dyed Ihesu cryste. ¶ Maister in to what place yede Adam whā he was put out of paradys terrestre. My chylde he yode in to Ebr where he was create / & there engendred he so¦nes & doughters wherof we ben all comen where he went longe yme his sone Abell that Cayn kylled by . ¶ Mayster syth yt the deuyl tēpted Adā & Eue why were they so greuosly punisshed. My chylde for that / yt they mystoke the cōmaundement of god for to obey to the {per}suacyons of ye deuyll / & that they ne hel∣de theym contente wt god that somoche of grace vnto them had gyuen. By the whiche they synned in .iij. maners. That is to vnderstande in pryde whan they mystoke the cōmaundement of god. And in couetyse whan they were not contente of y• / that god vnto thē had gyuen / and in the synne of the mouthe in etynge the fruyte that god them had defended. ¶ Mayster whan yt he repented hym: & also dyd grete penaunce / wherfore was he not restablysshed after his dethe in his fyrst estate. My chylde for as moche as y• penaū∣te was not suffycyent to the reparacyon of all those yt
he had put from paradyse by his synne wherefoore was necessarye that the seconde persone in trynytee whiche is the blessyd sone of god made the reparacy¦on for hym / and how be it that the blessyd god is euer more mercyfull / he is ryghtwyse and reasonable. ¶ Mayster wherfore sente not god an aungell for to bye humayne lynage. My chylde for as moche that yf the aungell had redemyd the man / he had ben sub∣iecte vnto the aungell and god hath made the man to be in the state of aungells. And also it was conuena∣ble sythe the man hadde done the synne that the man hym repayred / and also my chylde thou sholdest kno∣we & vnderstande that the blessyd sone of god in pro∣pre persone wolde repayre the helth and synne of man and to bere the penaunce and to suffre dethe and passy¦on ryght dolorous for hym and to humble hym to ta∣ke our fragylyte and nature in the wombe vyrgynall for to shewe the grete affeccyon and the greate loue y• he hath towarde vs the whiche he made vnto his sem¦blaunce. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne made god that an aungell toke nature humayne. My chylde for theyse causes that I haue now telled the / and also for none aungell ne other creature ne had puyssaunce to open paradyse but god all onely / & it was close vnto ye man by his trespace / wherfore it was of necessyte that the sonne of god were sente downe here alowe for to rede∣me nature humayne / and for to open hym paradyse / And knowe thou that he hadde in hym two natures. That is to vnderstande nature dyuyne / for he was and is very god / and nature humayne / for he was & is very man / and for as moche vaynquysshed he the deuyll the whiche had vaynquysshed the man & ope∣ned
paradys and was of the lygne of Adam and dyd for hym penaunce. ¶ Mayster wherfore ne toke the fader & the holy goost nature humayne as well as ye sone. My chylde for that / yt the sone is the semblaun∣ce of the fader and graunteth vnto hym all thynges by the whiche it was a thynge conuenable yt the sone all onely drewe vnto hym the man for to drawe hym vnto his fader aboue in paradyse. depiction of master and disciple ye discyple. ye mayster. MAyster wherefo∣re wolde god be borne of ye vyrgyn Ma∣ry. My chylde god ma∣de the man in foure ma¦ners. The fyrste was wtout man & wtout wo∣man as Adam. The .ij. was of a man without woman as Eue. The .iij. was of the man and of ye woman as we ben Now was to make the iiij. maner the which is of the woman which is man as is Ihesu cryst. And the other reason is suche for lykewyse as the dethe come in erthe by ye woman the whiche was Eue. Also ye lyfe came in to the erthe by the woman. That is to knowe the blessyd Vyr∣gyn Mary the whiche vs hath borne the frute of ly∣fe eternall. ¶ Mayster how chylded she. My chylde she chylded wtout payne and wtout dolour and abode entyer vyrgyn / & pure / & clene from all spotte before the chyldynge / at the chyldynge / & alter the chyldyn∣ge
as the glasse thorowe the whiche ye sonne passeth without makynge therin any openynge. But for as moche as god wolde holde the ordre of nature he abo∣de nyne monethes in the wombe vyrgynal / & he wal¦ked not incontynent that he was borne. ¶ Mayster at what houre was he borne. My chylde he was bor¦ne at mydnyghte / and at that houre appered in the skye a starre moche fayre and clere that it was mar∣ueylous to be holde / the sonne was fayre as ye golde / and peace and vnyte was thorowe oute the worlde / and obeyed vnto one onely prynce the which was na¦med Cesar / & at that houre the dombe beestes spake / & Idolles of the sarazyns & paynyms fell to the erthe ¶ Mayster wherefore toke he the gyftes of the thre kynges. My chylde for in takynge the golde he she∣wed yt he was kȳge almyghtly / and by the ensence yt he was wery god: & by the myrre very man / and the kynge the whiche bare the golde was called Baltha¦sar / and Iasper bare the myrre / & Melchyor bare the ensence. ¶ Mayster in howe many maners ben our synnes pardoned. My chylde they ben pardoned vs in .v. maners. First by the sacramētes of holy chyrch y• whiche ben .vij. that is to knowe baptym / confyr∣macyon / confessyon / the order of preesthode / the sacra¦ment of the auter / the sacrament of mariage / and the vnccyon / but baptym is the fyrst / & that the whiche moost clenly putteth oute the synnes / and after bap∣tym / confyrmacyon and confessyon ben the moost ne∣cessaryes. Secondly our synnes vnto vs ben pardo∣ned by almesdede. Thyrdely by oryson / and by fa∣stynges. Fourthlye by pardonynge vnto oure enmy∣es / & fyfthely by charyte. ¶ Mayster ben all our syn∣nes
pardoned by baptym. My chylde ye / for by bap∣tym we ben as men vnto Iesu cryste in doynge hym this homade / & we ben delyuered from ye seruytude of synne. ¶ Mayster wherfore ben they baptysed the whiche ben borne of thē yt ben baptysed / & also ye chyl∣dren the whiche haue nothynge offended. My chylde if any paast were corrupte with venym all the breed y• whiche of it sholde be made shold be venymous and corrupte. And for as moche as our fore fathers were corrupte by synne they and all theyr ygnee were ba∣nysshed out of paradys terrestre / & vnto theym were shytte the gate of paradyse celestyall / the whiche ne may be opened vnto the man / yf he be not first bapty∣sed as wytnessyth the holy scrypture / and how be it yt the father and the mother ben baptysed yt suffyseth not vnto the chylde for to be baptysed / for whā a mā him baptyseth / nature comune ne baptysed hym but all onely the persone pertyculer / wherfore it is of ne∣cessyte that we ben all baptysed in pertyculer. ¶ Ma∣ster wherefore ne named god that all were baptysed to be saued. My chylde hit is not the deuaute of god that all ne byn baptysed / for he hath gyuen vnto eue¦ry man and woman lyberall arbytre and fre wyll y• to do. Also baptyme sholde be made of free wyll and without constraynt for yf god constrayned the man to be baptysed he had not his lyberall arbytre / and so all his baptyme had no meryte. ¶ Mayster where¦fore espouseth not man now his cosynes as in the aū∣cyent lawe. My chylde hit is for to encreace amyte & loue betwene straungers / For those the whiche ben of blode loueth eche other Inoughe more than these other / wherfore it behoueth for to put loue & charyte
where it is not / and the other reason is suche. For the chyldren had two proximitis togyders as to be sone and neuew wherfore for honeste it was ordeyned to make maryage betwene estraungers / but in the olde lawe men espoused the women of lygnage / & it was for to multyplye & to encrease ye worlde. ¶ Mayster wherfore was Ihesu cryste baptysed. my chylde he was circumsyzed for to accomplysshe the olde lawe. and baptyzed for to begyn the new lawe & for to she∣we his grete humylyte in gyuynge vs example that we all sholde be regenerate by baptym. ¶ Mayster wherfore is baptym in water. my chylde for that wa¦ter is contrary vnto fyre / wherfore for to quenche the sayd fyre of synne we ben baptysed in water. And in lykewyse as the water wassheth all ordures and fyl∣thes. Also the baptym wassheth all synnes / and god theym establysshed in water for as moche as the wa∣ter is comune ouer all the worlde to the ende yt a man fynde the soner water of ye sayd sacrament to ye ende yt none ne may excuse hym that he ne coude fynde wher¦of that he myght make hym to be baptysed or that he myght haue. ¶ Mayster what worde ought a man to speke in baptym. My chylde a man oughte to saye thus. I baptyse the in the name of the father / & of the sone / and of the holy goost amen. In puttynge thre tymes of water vpon ye heed of hym that a man bap∣tyseth / and so may they say in all languages / so that it be in good beleue & in good intencyon & other wor∣des the whiche ne ben of the necessyte of the sayd sa∣crament of baptym. ¶ Mayster was it a thynge re∣sonable that god the fader gaue so noble thynge as is the sone for to by agayne so caytyf a thynge as is the
man. My chylde in that vs sheweth god the father ye grete and abūdaunt loue that he hath vnto creature humayne. ¶ Mayster syth yt god hath sent downe he¦re alowe his sonne by so grete charyte and for to re∣deme ye humaynes wherfore dyd men to hym so mo∣che of payne. My chylde Iudas hym betrayed by co∣uetyse. Pylate him cōdēpnyd for drede to lese his offy¦ce / & the Iewes him put to deth by enuy. ¶ Maister wherfore dyed Ihesu cryste on the tree of the crosse / My chylde for as Adam synned by the tree of lyfe. Al¦so god hym wolde bye agayne by the tree of the crosse & thou sholdest knowe that by the foure partyes of ye crosse the which sheweth all the worlde / it is agayne shewed vnto vs that the dethe of Iesu cryst was suf∣fycyent for to bye not onely nature humayne / but al∣so all the vnyuersall worlde if it had be loste. ¶ May∣ster how longe abode Ihesu cryste in the erthe deed / My chylde he there abode .xl. houres. And whan we say that he arose the thyrde day / & that in thre dayes is nor .xl. houres thou sholdest vnderstande that he dyed the fryday at the houre of noone / and all the sa∣terdaye he was deed in the holy sepulcre ye whiche is the seconde day / and the sonday after he arose ryght erly / and for as moche as the course of nature is rene∣wed at mydnyght and the daye / in takynge one par∣tye of the day for all the day entyer. ¶ Mayster why¦ther yede the soule of Ihesu cryst whan he was deed My chylde he yede in to glory towarde god the fader in yeldynge vnto hym thankes and praysynges in de¦maundynge hym the holy soules the whiche he had redemed by the meryte of his holy passyon / the whi∣che thynge god hym graunted. Than opened the sou¦le
of Ihesu cryst the whiche was coniuncte with the deite the gates of paradys the whiche had ben shyt by longetyme vnto all humayne lygnage / and ye sa∣terday about the houre of mydnyght he descended in to hell and brake the gates & yede to vysyte his good frendes. That is to vnderstande the soules of the ho∣ly auncyent fathers the whiche greatly hym desyred and theym delyuered frome the pryson of the lymbe with all the holy soules the which haue meryted pa∣radys by their holy werkes / and this fayre company mounted in to heuen and theym presentyd vnto god the father the whiche them receyued benygnely and them putteth in to the realme of paradise in ye places and syeges that the cursed Aungelles loste by theyr pryde. And he delyuered not the soules of the damned as Iudas / and of the cursyd ryche man dyues and of many other / but theym he lefte in hell in payne and in turment with all the deuylles without gyuynge them ony comforte where they ben yet and shalbe for euer. And on ye sōday before the sonne rysynge retur∣nyd the soule vnto the body of Ihesus that lay in the Sepulcre / and rose from dethe vnto lyfe. ¶ Mayster wherfore arose not he as soone as he was deed. My chylde for a man had lytell presumed that he had ben deed / and he wolde begyn for to renewe the worlde on the Sonday by his resurreccyon. For at suche an houre all the worlde began to be. ¶ Mayster where was he after his esurreccyon / forty dayes before his ascencyon. My chylde he was in Paradys terre∣ster. with Helyas and Enoch in enstructynge theym y• which was done as whan he appered. ¶ Mayster how many tymes apered he. My chylde / he appered
fyrst vnto Ioseph of barmathye y• had buryed hym / ye whiche for so doynge was put in pryson. After vn∣to his mother: after to the blessyd Mawdeleyne: af∣ter vnto the .ij. pylgrymes comynge from the holy se¦pulcre: after to saynt Iames the whiche wolde not ete tyll that he had seen hym. After vnto saynt Peter after to the two pylgrymes ye whiche went to the ca¦stell of malux after he appered vnto his dyscyples ye gates shytte: after vnto saynt Thomas whan he put his hande in the syde of our lorde Ihesu cryste: after vnto his dyscyples in the see of Tyberyon / and so my chylde thou shold vnderstāde yt our lorde Ihesu cryst appered .xij. tymes before that he ascendid in to heuē ¶ Mayster who ascēdyd in to heuen with hym. My chylde the Soules of the blessyd the whiche than by theyr merytes were saued / and also grete multytude of aungelles of heuen ye which hym accompanyed in syngynge melodyously & yeldynge thankes vnto god ¶ Mayster wherefore abode he .xl. dayes to mounte in to heuen after that he was rysen. My chylde for y• that he gaue grete payne .xl. houres whan he abode in the erth vnto his frendes & dyscyples wherfore he wolde cōforte them .xl. dayes / that is one day for eue∣ry houre in tokenynge yt for payne he gyueth greate Ioye / & also he dyd it for to conferme them in the ho∣ly faythe / as saynt Thomas & other / vnto whom he apperyd vysybly. ¶ Mayster what is that to say / yt the sone is sette on the right hande of his father. My chylde it is to saye that ye humanyte is in glory with the dyuynyte. ¶ Mayster in what maner and forme ascendyd Ihesu cryste in to heuen. My chylde he sty∣ed in to heuen in suche fourme and maner as whan
he hym transfygured before some of his dyscyples in the mountayne of Tabor that is to vnderstande that he had the armes stretched & lyfte vp in heyght / and his face shynynge as the sonne. And his vestemētes were whyte as snowe / and a fayre and clere clowde descendynge from heuen / & it closed roūde about hym and so mountyd in to heuen in suche wyse yt they lost the syght corporall of hym. ¶ Mayster wherfore is ye sacrament of the awter made of breed / and of wyne My chylde for as the grayne of the corne hath ben be¦ten and flayled and had the sede clouen In lykewyse the precyous body of Ihesus was beten & scourged / and had the syde opened / out of ye whiche Issued blo∣de and water / wherfore men put water vnto the sayd sacrament. And as the wyne lepeth from ye grape by force of the wryngyuge in the pressour. In lykewyse the precyous blode of Iesus lepte from his precyous body on the pressour of ye crosse / and it was not esta∣blysshed of the flesshe nor of the bloode for a man may horrour to drynke blode and to ete flesshe / but it was establysshed of breed and wyne / that is the moost co∣mune refeccyon that is / and also the breed / and the wyne ben the moost comune and the moost profyta∣ble for to nourysshe the body. In lykewyse the sacra∣mente of the awter is the mooste commune / and the moost profytable refeccyon for to nourysshe the sou∣le. ¶ Mayster howe shall we vnderstande that hit is the holy bodye of Ihesu cryste and his precyouse bloode vnder the kynde of breed and of wyne. My chylde as the breed and the wyne that thou eatys & drynkest conuerte theym in to thyne owne bodye and in to thyn owne bloode. In lykewyse the sacrament

MAister what say ye of th the which receyueth the sayd sacrament in mortall Synne. My chyld / they cru¦cyfye of newe oure lorde Ihesu Cryste and him receyueth vnto their dampna¦cyon. ¶ Mayster ye preest that is īmor∣tall synne / maye he sacre and admyny∣ster the holye bodye and blode of Ihesu Cryste. My chylde ye / for the sacramēt e empayreth / ne amendeth by the condycyon of the
preest / as the sonne whan that it shyneth vpon foule thynges and stynkynge lesyth not his clerete / but ye preest it doth vnto his dampnacyō / and yf he be with out synne it is vnto his saluacyon. ¶ Mayster howe longe abydeth the body of Ihesu cryste in the wom∣be of hym the whiche hym receyueth. My chylde he there abydeth as longe as the substaūce of the breed there may amyde vndegested and no more / but thou shalt vnderstande that god there is and also abydeth euermore with theym the whiche ben in the state of grace. ¶ Mayster / whā many prestes syngeth masse the bodye of cryste is it ouer all / My chylde / ye / For god is and maye be ouer all as thy soule the whiche is hoole in euerye partye of the bodye. ¶ Mayster shold a man hate the yll. My chylde a man sholde ha∣te theyr cursydnes and folyes and not to do euyll as they done / but we sholde loue oure nature / for we be all ye sones of one father and of one mother & bought and redemed with one selfe blode / and if they doo the ony wronge thou sholdest pardon them and praye for theym vnto the example of Ihesu cryst / the whiche prayed for them that him crucyfyed and put vnto the dethe. For it is the werke mooste merytoryous that we maye do. ¶ Mayster wherfore haue the euyll so many of goodes and of prosperytees in this worlde. My chylde there is not so yll in this worlde but that somtyme dothe some good dede. And for as moche as man dyde neuer any good dede but that it were recō∣pensed / nor neuer dyd euyll but that hit be punysshed And for this cause god them sendeth of grete goodes & prosperytees in retrybucyon of theyr good dede / & so vnto them gyueth puyssaunce & auctoryte vpon ye
good to the ende y• the good ben proued by them / and sometyme god sendeth trybulacyon vnto the yll / to thende that they amende them / and yf they do it not neuerthelesse that shall be in dymynucyō of theyr syn¦nes that they shold suffer & haue in hell. Or they shal haue encreasynge of other grete goodes temporals / but god gyueth of trybulacyons & aduersytees vnto the good for to proue them as vnto Iob / & vnto Tho∣bye to the ende y• they dyspraysed the vanytes of this worlde / & that they sholde not forgete theyr creature and that by theyr merytes in takynge all in pacyence they may haue the glorye of paradyse / and somtyme god theym gyueth of goodes to thende yt they be the more charytable and that they augment in glorye in paradys. The good dyeth somtyme anone to the en∣de that they empeyre not for to auoyde the perylles & temptacyons the which ben in this worlde / and also ye good lyueth somtyme longely for to encreace theym in bounte / & to thende that by theyr good example & doctryne the ylle may amende them / and also the ylle dyeth anone sometyme for to make these other ylle a ferde to ye ende that they amende them / and somtyme the ylle lyueth longely for to proue the good / and also for god taryeth that they sholde amende them / and so thou sholde vnderstande my chylde yt the opynyon of some doctours is yt ye mercy of god is so grete yt he suf¦freth euermore ye man to dye in ye best estate & purpose that he may fynde hym. For god wyll not ne also suf∣freth not the dethe & dāpnacion of a man / but wylleth that conuerte hym & lyue eternally in paradys / and how be it that many dyeth sodeynly & wtout hauyng space to confesse them & to do penaunce & satysfaccyō
How be it vnto suche purpose may they dye and in so grete contrycyon of herte that god them taketh vnto mercy. ¶ Mastier shall the ryche & the poore be egal∣lye guerdoned & rewarded. My chylde of as moche as they be the more sage and ye more dygne of as mo∣che shall they be the better rewarded whā they shall be good / and whan they shall mowe be euyll of vs moche shall they be the more greuouslye punysshed. ¶ Mayster maye god do euyll. my chylde / nay: for how be it that he be all puyssaunt / neuerthelesse it is not entendyd that he may do thynges contrarye vn∣to reason / and that they ben Impossyble for to be. ¶ Mayster wherfore suffreth god yt the beestes haue so moche of payne / and also they haue not deserued it my chylde it is somtyme that by ye synne of the man the vengeaūce of god falleth vpon the beestes & vpon theyse other goodes to the ende that he amende hym or for to proue hym as Iob. And also than beestes bē made to susteyne & to nourisshe the man by ye whiche they ben vnder his subieccyon. And also for all thyn∣ges sholde serue vs to that wherunto they ben ordey∣ned / as the brydge the whiche is made to passe / or to go ouer. In lykewyse my chylde god it suffreth to thende that therby we take example / for syth that ye beestes suffreth so moche of payne for theyr poore lyfe corporall / we shold well more trauayle and take pay¦ne to gete the lyfe eternall of paradys in the whiche a man shall lyue eternallye. ¶ Mayster knoweth god whether that a man shall be saued or dampned before that he be borne. My chylde yes / not that god it dothe in entencyon for to dampne hym / for god ne dampnyth hym but ye man dampnith hymselfe with
out ony constraynt but of his owne wyll the whiche is at his owne lyberall arbytre or fre wyll. As we se the boterflye ye whiche of hym selfe and of his propre wyll hym brēneth in the candell. And how be it that the sayde boterflye is sometyme scalded wt the fyre of the candell in suche wyse that often he falleth vnto ye erthe / also he ryseth agayn the best wyse he can / and with all his power he putteth hymselfe agayne in ye fyre of the candell all holly that he there abydeth / not withstandynge that he seeth well the daungere. Also done those the whiche dampneth themselfe / for how be it that they se and knowe the daunger that therin is / and also that they ben often scalded by trybulacy∣ous / and aduersytees to thende that they conuert thē and that by inspyracyon dyuyne they haue some re∣mors / how be it for that they cease not tyll vnto that / that of theyr owne wyll & wtout ony constraynt they put them so depe in ye fyre that they there abyde and shall neuer go forthe. And how be it that good wyll of symple wyll yt all men be saued and hath one so grete a gyfte as the realme of paradys without ony mery∣te / and by suche wyse my chylde knowe thou yt god hath made ye man not to thende that he be dampned but to thende that by his holy operacyōs in suffryng pacyentlye trybulacyons and aduersytees / and in re¦systynge and fyghtynge valyauntlye ayenst the de∣uyll / the worlde and the flesshe / he may meryte to be saued. ¶ Mayster those ye whiche ben predestynate to be saued may they be saued without deseruynge it & to trauayle therefore. My chylde nay / for god kno∣with well that by theyr merytes and trauayles they shall be saued. And in lykewyse may a man say of the
dampnyd. ¶ Mayster syth that those the whiche bē predestynate to be saued may they not be dāpned and those ye whiche shold be dampned may they be sauyd what auayleth it elles so moche to trauayle for to ha∣ue paradys or hell. My chylde if thou be predestyna∣te to be saued in the glorye eternall thou sholdest not encrease thy paynes in purgatory / & to lesse thy glory in paradys by faute to do well / & yf thou be predesty∣nate to be dāpned thou sholdest not therfore euermo∣re lyue in synne / but thou sholdest euermore enforce ye to do well / & to do penaunce for to lesse thy paynes in hell & for as moche as thou knowest not whereunto thou art destynate / thou sholde alwayes thynke on ye better {per}ty yt is to vnderstāde yt god the hath made vn¦to his sēblaunce / & hath bought ye with his precyous blode for to saue ye & not to dampne the. wherfore my chylde thou shold euermore do good dedes & to fle the yll & knowe thou my chylde yt god ye hath gyuē wytte & vnderstādynge reason & fre wyll & lyberall arbytre to chose the good or ye yll to thende that thau haue not ony cause of Ignoraunce or of Impuyssaūce. ¶ Ma∣ster what say ye of them ye which neuer hereth the cō¦maundementes of god ne none they done. My chyl∣de the men ben made vnto the Image & vnto ye sem∣blaūce of god to thende yt they hym loue serue & drede and therfore if they knowe not theyr creature in this worlde we shall not knowe them in ye other / ne yet by theyr Ignoraunce they shall not be excused but more soner accusyd / for ye Ignoraūce excusyth not ye synne. ¶ Mayster yf a chylde were nourysshed in a wood & he had neuer harde speke of the fayth of Iesu cryste shal he be dāpned yf y• he dye in suche wyse. My chyl∣de
it is a thynge to beleue yt god maketh reuelacyō vn¦to euery persone of ye fayth of Iesu cryst by techynge of man or by reuelacyon dyuyne or otherwyse / & if he go ayenst the sayd reuelacyon knowe thou yt he shall be dampned. ¶ Mayster ben the soules made from ye begynnynge of the worlde. My chylde nay / but god them createth all the dayes & thē putteth in ye bodyes of ye chyldren wtin the wombe of theyr moder that is to vnderstāde vnto men at .xl. dayes after theyr cōcep¦cyon. Mayster what auayleth vs cōfessyō. My chyl∣de it is the secōde baptym. For in lykewyse as by bap¦tym all synnes be pardoned. In lykewyse by ye vertu of the sacrament of cōfessyon all our synnes be pardo¦ned / for as moche as a man knowlegeth his defaute before god or before his lyeutenaunt for God loueth more obedyēce thā sacryfyce / for obedyēce is mother of all v{er}tues. ¶ Mayster auayleth more penaūce don by enioynynge of the cōfessoure than penaūce don by wyll. My chylde if thy cōfessoure ye hath enioyned in penaūce one pater n all onely / & thou leue it to say an hole sauter syn̄est / & thou shalt not acquyte ye of thy penaūce / but yf thou saydest the Pēnr̄ y• which to the was enioynyd / and yu leuest to say the sauter or other many fayre orysons / yt yu sayst by symple wyll yu shalt not syn̄e / but yu shalt acquyte ye of thy penaūce / for as I haue tolde the more better is obedyēce done to our lorde than doth the sacryfyce. ¶ Mayster what auay¦leth contrycion at the poynt of deth. My chylde those the which abydeth thē to repent tyll vnto ye houre of deth ben trechoures vnto our lord as the trechoure & yll payer yt promyseth for to paye at a certayne terme but he wolde that the terme sholde neuer come / and
for this mater & cause he maketh a .M. trecheryes vn¦to his creature to thende that he ne paye hym so sone or neuer / and of ye other parte saynt Luke sayth that god is not well payed of hym the which hym payeth of that thynge yt he ne may no lenger holde. Howe be it / it is wryten that at what houre yt the synner shall declare his synne in grete repentaunce and cōtrycyō that it vnto hym shall be pardoned. But my childe it is a ryght grete parell to abyde hym to repēt / for thā a man is so troubled that a man knoweth not hym∣selfe nor none other / for as sayth the psalmys (Om̄¦nō est in morte q memor sit tui: in iferno aūt quis con∣fitebitur tibi) That is to say yt as the deed man hath no remembraunce of god / and that is no tyme hym to repent and to confesse his synne whan that a man is in hell for the sentēce of god is gyuen. Than my chyl∣de thou shold repent & cōfesse ye whā thou hast tyme & space / & thou sholdest not tarye tyll to morowe / for yu knowest not whether thou shalte deye to mo∣rowe or sooner. depiction of master and disciple ye discyple. ye mayster. MAyster sythen that the synne of pryde is {per}doned by baptyme wherfore dy∣eth those the which ben baptysed. My chylde the good deyeth to the ende that they ben ta∣ken from the trybulacy¦on

My chylde yt man the whiche dyeth so daynly / so that he be in the state of grace he gothe in to paradys or in to purgatory to accomplysshe his pe¦naunces / and vnto hym the sharpe deth is merytory∣ous agaynst his syn̄es venyalles & vnto ye dymynu∣cyon of the paynes of purgatory & vnto the augmen∣tacyon of the glory of paradyse / & yf he dye sodeynlye in mortall Synne the sodeyn deth hym putteth in as moche as he is vnpourueyed and without cōfessyon ne repentaūce takynge / than he is damyned eternal∣ly / & by this and for this cause my chylde thou sholde be euermore redy for to deye in kepynge ye from syn̄e / for thou knowest not whan ne of what dethe thou shalte dye. ¶ Mayster what auayleth it a man to be buryed in the chyrche yarde. My chylde if he be ī pur¦gatorye he is the soner delyuered as well by the pray¦ers of the chyrche as of his kynnesmen and frendys ye whiche vysyteth his sepulture in prayenge god for hym. And oftē it happeth that the chyrcheyardes bē sanctyfyed by the bodyes of some sayntes that there be / & prayeth for them / wherof if those that there ben buried ben saued they be right Ioyfull whā theyr bo¦dyes ben wt the bodyes of other sayntes / but yf they ben dāpned it profyteth them nothynge. For the good dedes yt men there done for them ne may helpe them. ¶ Mayster what maner of lyfe is the moost excellent and best for to make his saluacyon. My chylde to ha∣ue

My chylde ye soules of ye Innocen∣tes yt deyeth without baptym gooth vnto ye lymbe yt

And the soules of them the whiche dyeth in one mortall synne or many goth in to the depenes of hell / where they bē punysshed af∣ter theyr deseruynge / and the soules of the Iewes / and of the myscreaūtes ye whiche dyeth in the estate of Innocencye gone in to a parte of hell with all the other chyldren ye whiche dyeth without baptym / but the soules of ye other Iewes & myscreauntys yt haue wytte & vnderstādynge goth in to hell wt the dāpned. ¶ Mayster in how lytell tyme ben the soules delyue∣red from purgatory. My chylde some there abydeth more longely than other after as they haue deserued for some ben delyuered at ye ende of .vii. dayes / & ther∣fore maketh a man the semell otherwyse called the re¦turne in makynge prayers & almesdedes for their de∣lyueraunce /

These other ben delyuered at the ende of one yere / & therfore is made the yeres mynde / & these other abydeth there by many yeees / & by longe tyme after yt they haue deseruyd / & therfo∣re make men remembraunce euery yere of them / and whan they ben all purged & that they ben delyueryd as by theyr penaūces accomplysshed / as by our pray¦ers and oraysons / they go all ryght vnto the glory of paradys. ¶ Mayster in what place is paradys. My chylde there ar .iij. maner of paradys / that is to wyte paradys celestyall / paradyse terrestre / and paradys spirituall. Paradyse celestyal is aboue all the heuens in the whiche is god and all ye sayntes holy men and women as I haue sayd before / paradyse terrestre is in the erth towarde the oryent / & paradys spyrytuall is ayenst god / & to loue hym perfytely & yt is ouer all In that paradys ben our good aūgelles ye whiche se¦eth & loueth god. ¶ Mayster where is hell. My chyl∣de there are .ij. maner of helles / yt is to wyte hel spiri∣tuall & hell corporall / hell spūall is ouer all where the soules & ye cursed aungels bē in payne & tourment be it in erth or in ye see / & this may be in many places / as we rede of a soule that was turmēted wt a flage of yse ye a bysshop delyuered by .xxx. masses / who was boū∣de to be there lōge tyme. Hell corporall is in ye myddle of ye erthe as ye carnell of an apple is in the myddle of ye apple & is a grete caue blacke & darke in which ben iiij. stages ye one aboue ye other. At ye fyrst stage is the place wherin were the holy soules of ye holy fathers aūcyētes & of them yt by theyr holy lyfe & cōuersacion
haue meryced the realme of paradys the whiche our lorde Ihesu cryst delyuered whan he dyed on the tre of the crosse and now there is none / For at that tyme were all delyuered. At the seconde stage is purgatory wherin the soules the whiche sholde be saued goth to accomplysshe theyr penaūce the which they haue not accomplysshed in this worlde in theyr lyfe. In ye .iij. stage ben the soules of the Innocentes the whiche dyeth without baptym. And ī the .iiij. stage ye which is the moost lowe in depnes ben the deuylles and the soules of the poore & myserable dampned. depiction of master and disciple the mayster. the discyple. MAister what paynes ha∣ue they ye which bē in purgatorye. My chylde they ben tur¦mented with the fy∣re of hell moche mo∣re hotter than ye fy∣re matery all of this present worlde in cōparyson ayenst a fy¦re paynted vpon a wall / and they ben there bounde with chaynes of fyre all brennyng so sperke lynge that a man ne can speke it. In the whiche place some ben there more punysshed than
these other / and there abyde more longely than the o∣ther after as they haue deserued. ¶ Mayster what payne is there in hell. My chylde there are soo many dyuers paynes & tourmentes yt there is none enten∣dement humayne ye which can comprehēde ne Ima∣gen as of fyre stynkynge and ryght brennynge / of to∣des / serpentes / dragons / and of al foule and cruell be∣stes / & of deuylles enraged & wode the whiche neuer ben wery for to bete & tourment the poore & mysera∣ble dāpned / but euermore ben for to begynne in suche wyse that the leest payne of hell surmounteth all the paynes of this world / but the one is more punysshed than the other after their desert / and at the day of Iu¦gement theyr payne shall doubte / for than they shall aryse & shall be dampned in body & in souse. ¶ May∣ster what payne haue the soules of the Innocentes y• which dyeth wtout baptym. My chylde they ne haue payne / ne doloure / ne Ioye / ne gladnes. For they ne∣uer dyd good nor euyll / by ye which they haue not me∣ryted to haue ony good / ne to haue ony euyll & howe be it yt the place wherin they ben be dym & derke. All be it there is nothynge the which them greueth / and whan the day of Iugement shall come that they shal ryse they shall be of the aege that oure lorde Ihesu cryste was whan he dyed on the tre and all the other. Also the sayd chyldren not baptysed shall be contente with the ordenaūce of god / & thā shall returne agayn in to theyr sayd place without euer to haue Ioy ne he¦uynes no more than thou hast of that / ye thou hast no wynges for yt apertayneth vnto ye byrdes & not vnto men / or as thou hast whā a kynge or ony grete pryn∣ce dyeth & thou shalte not succede his realme & syng∣ourye
for thou knowest well thou arte not he the which sholde enheryte. Also they sholde not enheryte the gloryous realme of Paradyse for they ben exyled by ye synne of Adā & of Eue / of the whiche synne they haue not ben purged by baptyme. ¶ Mayster those of paradys se they those of hell. My chylde ye / and y• vnto them is a grete encreasynge of glory whan they se the paynes yt they haue escaped wherof they than∣ke god without ceasyng / and also the dampned seeth the saued in paradys as we haue in the gospell of the cursed ryche man Dyues the whiche sawe the soule of the poore Lazare in the bosome of Abraham in pa∣radys / the whiche thynge is to them a grete encrea∣synge of theyr doloure & anguysshe whan they se the grete goodes spyrytuall that they haue lost by theyr synnes & by theyr neclygēce / & after the day of Iuge∣mente as the bodyes of the saued shall be gloryfyed / they shall se the dāpned corporally / but the dampnyd may not se them corporally. ¶ Maister ben the saued wroth of the payne of the dampned. My chylde they that ben in paradys wolde well that those the which ben in hell hadde soo well lyued whan they were in this worlde / that by theyr holy werkes they had ben saued with them. For without ceasynge they praye for the humaynes lyuynges within this p̄sent world but sythen that they by their cursyd lyfe and by theyr Synnes they ben dampned for euer / theyse of para∣dyse neyther ben heuy nor dysplesaunt. For in Para∣dyse there is not of heuynes / nor of dyspleasaunce of ony manes thynge. But all Ioye / myrthe / and glad∣nesse without ende. ¶ Mayster the auncient fathers suffred they ony maner of payne in the lymbe of hell
My chylde nay / but all onely that they were holden in derkenes and in captyuyte. And were put from the vysyon of god and aboue euermore theyr delyueraū∣ce. ¶ Mayster what knowlege haue the Iuste the whiche ben in paradys. My chylde they knowe the good & theyr merytes & of the cursyd also / and ye cur∣knoweth wherfore they ben dampned / & knoweth as we that thynge that they se and feele. And those of purgatory ne knoweth nothynge of this worlde / yf it be not by reuelacyon of aūgels ye whiche them cō∣forteth or of ye sayntes of paradys. These of paradys sheweth theym whan they wyll / and vnto whome they wyll / but the dampned shall neuer come forthe of hell tyll vnto the daye of Iugement that they shal come to take agayne theyr bodyes and to here the sen¦tence of the soueraygne Iuge / & after they shall retur¦ne in to hell from whens they shall neuermore retur∣ne.
