A Proclamation commanding Conformity to his Maiesties pleasure, expressed in his late Char∣ter to the Tobacco-pipe-makers. WHereas diuers of the poorer sort of Our Subiects haue hereto∣fore liued by the trade of making Tobacco pipes, but for want of power to retaine and keepe their Apprentices and seruants in due obedience, and to restraine others from intruding vpon their Arte, the auncient Makers haue not so well prospered as was desired: For preuention of which inconueniences, and for reducing the worke∣men in that trade to such a competent number, as they might bee gouerned after the example of other Societies, who florish by rang∣ing themselues vnder good Orders; We did by Our late Charter Incorporate a selected num∣ber of the most ancient, and such others as they for skill and honestie should admit into their So∣citie: Thereby prohibiting all others who were not members thereof, to make any sort of Tobacco-pipes within Our Realme of England or Dominion of Wales; And thereby also commanding, that no person or persons directly, or indirectly should buy Tobacco-pipes to sell againe, of, or from the hands of any others then the knowne Members of the said Societie. Yet neuertherlesse being lately informed by Certificate from sundry Our Iustices of Peace of Our Counties of Middlesex and Surrey (who in due obedience of Our Royall pleasure, decla∣red in Our said Charter, did in person assist the execution of the same) That diuers lewde and obstinate offenders, had fortified themselues in their houses with weapons, And in contempt of Our Regall Authority resisted them, comming with the seuerall Warrants of the Lord Chiefe Iustice of Our Bench, and other the Iustices of Peace within Our Citie of London, and the said counties of Middlesex and Surrey; And also that there were diuers il disposed persons (who delighting to oppose al good orders) contemptuously maintained these vnderhand offendors, some by harboring the vnlawfull Makers of Tobacco-pipes secretly in their houses, there to make them contrary to Our Charter, to the end to partake of the stolne profit thereof; Others, by buying secretly this vnder-hand made ware, in contempt of Our Authority, and with an euill intent of ouerthrowing this Societie which we haue sought to establish. Now therefore, that by the presumptuous example of these disobedient persons, others may not be incouraged hereafter by impunity to presume to resist and contemne Our Royall Com∣mandement in matters of greater moment, or to withstand the authority of Magistrates and gouernment, These are to charge and straitly command, that no persons whatsouer within this Our Realme of England and Dominion of Wales shall hereafter presume to make any
manner of Tobacco-pipes, but such as are or shall bee members of the saide Societie: nor shall presume to harbour in their houses any Tobacco-pipe-makers to vse their trade there, who are not of the saide Societie; nor that any person or persons (especially who buy Tobacco-pipes to sell againe) shall at any time, or in any place buy or obtaine by any meanes, directly or indirectly any Tobacco-pipes whatsoeuer, from any vnder-handmakers or others, but only from such as are knowne members of the said Societie, & that at their common Hall, or other knowne Ware∣houses appointed, or hereafter to bee appointed, where they may bee bought by all Our louing Subiects, vpon paine of Our High displeasure, and such punishments as are due for such con∣tempts, whereof We shall require a strict account by proceeding against the offendours in Our Court of Starre-Chamber. Further commanding, that if at any time heereafter any person shall bee so audaci∣ous as to fortifie themselues in their houses, or in the houses of any other, or to withstand Our will and pleasure heerein, or to resist Our authoritie giuen and imparted to Our Lord chiefe Iustice and others, in the search or apprehension of them, or any of them; Then Wee doe heereby will and require, that sufficient power be had and taken by such who shal haue such Warrants, to apprehend such obstinate and contemptuous persons, and to carry them before Our said chiefe Iustice, or other Iustice of the Peace, that punishment may be inflicted on them in the seuerest manner Our Lawes will permit, by imprisoning their bodie, till they haue put in sufficient suretie for their good behauiour afterwards. Heereby further, straitly charging Our Atturney generall for the time being, that he cause all and euery such wilfull and disobedi∣ent persons, for such their high contempt in this behalfe, to be prosecuted in Our Court of Starre-Chamber (where Our will is they shall bee sharpely punished) according to the measure of such their audacious and bold resistance of Our Royall commandement. And to the intent that these fraudes and abuses may the better be found out and punished, Our pleasure is, that it shall and may bee lawfull for any two, or more of the said Societie, together with a lawfull officer to enter into any suspected place or places, at lawful & conuenient times, there to search for, and finde out any vnder-hand made, or sold Tobacco-pipes; And all such so found to seize, take, and carry away, and them safelye to keepe to bee disposed of, according to the tenor of Our sayd Charter. And lastly, for the full execution of this Our Royall Commandement, Wee will and require the Lord Maior of Our Citie of London, for the time being, and all other Maiors, Shi∣riffes, Iustices of Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, and all other Officers and Ministers whatso∣euer; That they and euery of them in their seuerall Offices and places, bee from time to time ayding and assisting to the Master, Wardens, and Societie of Tobacco-pipe makers in the due execution and accomplishment of this Our Royall will and Commandement, as they ten∣der Our pleasure, and will answere the contrary at their perill. Giuen at Our Court at Theobalds the seuen and twentieth day of May, in the eighteenth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ❧Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Ex∣cellent Maiestie. ANNO DOM. M. DC. XX.
