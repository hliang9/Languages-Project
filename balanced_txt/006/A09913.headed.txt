The booke to the papists. Ye Papistes, peruse me in no wyse trougheout Before ye refuse me, and iudge me to fyer. Lest ye should excuse ye, and say, lo no dout These new men misuse ye, for we much desier That they wold make answer, but answer they can not. They speake not, they wryte not, for answer they haue n The books frind to the booke. Speack on and spare not, and feare not the fyer. yf fyer say we shall not make answer with pen, Thow shalt see the papists want that there desyer.

The preface to the Christian reader. HE LORD IESVS help and assist vs with his holie spirite. THere shal I first begin? or rather where may I not begin? both the uestions haue some lyfe dowt goed . The nōber of matters / which Mar¦in his booke as one that wold seem now all thinge taketh apon him to de¦yne and discusse / causeth my doutin∣ of the on: And the multitude of his ghtes / shiftes / and shameles lyes / of other. And thus it may apeare that dowtinge is not for lack of matter rwith to begyn / but for hauinge to he / wold for the first place faine finde the fittest. Yf I begin not with the al∣ciō / and defense of the manifest scrip∣s of god / which make full and whole  me / I shal seem to muche to yeld to aduersaries / whose whole study and er is to lead away the reader from the rine of Gods word / and to fixe / ther

Lawes / ād inuentions of m and apon the vsurped name of the chche / and apon thaucthoritie of suche bkes as eyther be not in deed / or els of lerned men suspectid not to be wryt of such authors as there names and els do pretend. As apon the Cnons ascribed to the Apostels / Apon Epistels which all men of iudgem may euidently see be counterfect ād cred / with the auncient name of Cle and such lyke pithles testimonies and . And againe on t ther syde yf I beginn first with the  worthie Authoritie of the scriptu whiche vniuersally teach and proue purpose / yet in sondry places by Mar euydently wrestid from the proper s and meaninge of the holly gost:  must I refuse to folow Martyns or who beginneth his boke with a cha of raylinge / stuffed vp with asmany as there be lynes.Martyn ray∣leth apon yng henry the viij the queens fa∣ther. In the which hige / he is so blynded with furye / tha cann not temper his pen from rayl apō the famose prince Kinge Henry VIII. and ffather to the Quenes

And also it may be that then myne aduer¦aries / whose delyte is in euell speakinge ill saye that I vse a sleyght in refusinge Martyns former order (I meane off his llegacions and reasons that he would se¦e to make / but his raylings / I will lea∣e to himselff) and that I seek refuge for he feblenes of myne answer at the dar∣nes that must ensew apon the confusion f his matter. Thus might tonges talk hen they are (as they be) tykelled o speak vntrewly though the same ton∣es be tied fast enoughe / Sleyghtes vsd by Bushop gar¦diner and other papists in ther wyting.

When treuth fayleth. And because the treuth is alltogether on my syde / be∣gyn̄ where I shalle / I cannot take a foy¦le / if God graūt me the grace as occasiō shall serue so muche to say as may well be sayd to suche matter as is here in que∣stion. Whiche grace if god graunte me not / yet may not my want be an ouerthro¦we / to the matter / because the treuth re∣maineth treuth thoughe there were not one left in all England / or out of Englād either / hable to defend it. And God may so shitt vp the harts of the papists (as he vseth in a tyme of punishment) that they shall not see the treuth / When it is layd open before their faces. Yet shall I doe my best indeuor to stād fast by the treuth / and because there is nothinge more trew then the lyuely word of God therūto will I ōly cleaue / leauinge to the old doctors there worthie prayse ād com∣mendation / vsinge them in place / as well for the profe of my matter / as for my de∣fence / With a desyre to be playn that the treuth may appeare. And because the common iudgement of most men / is / that in a confutacion the playnest way / is to folow suche methode and order as is
offered by the aduersary: therfore haue I determenid to beginn where Martyn beginnith / and to goe on / as he goeth / ād to answer / where he reasoneth (if the matter be worthie answer) and to aduer¦tise you of his falshod when he plaieth the Sophister / The order which the au∣thor intendeth to folow in this furst book. thoughe very fondlie as thow shalt well perceaue. And When he maketh a lye to tell hī playn his fault. Whiche thinge beinge by his own words declarid / Without further reasonīge may be answer sufficient. Wherin if I seem somthinge round and vehement in ans∣wering him / or mencioning any other: Consid syncere reader the cause to be the veritie of Gods word / and because his impugninge is not only fond and folishe / but slaunderose and maliciose wherby he professeth himelf to be an open enemy to gods trueth / therfore I dowt not / but thyn indifferencie shall iudge that I say to lyttell / and do vse him more reuerently then his arrogant folly doth deserue / and that vehemēcie whiche I do vse / is groun¦ded apon Sainct Paule saynge / 1.

Wherfore trustinge that both thow ar willing and ready to follow his holly ad¦uertisement / and that euer as thou perus¦est our doings / thow wilt haue it in fresh rememberaunce / I will turne my talk from the / to Martyn.

The first Chapter: That Martins booke is vnmeet to be dedicated to a Queen. FIrst touchinge the tytell and prefa∣ce of your booke your intēt is Mar∣tin (as it apeareth by the same) to proue that the mariadge of priestes and profes¦sed parsons is not only a thinge altoge∣ther vnlawfull: but also that ther mari∣adge is but a thinge pretensid and inde∣de no mariadge. And you thinke you ha∣ue made so wittie a discourse / and so pro∣found a resolucion / in this so weghty a matter / by your clarkly wisedom: and So¦phisticall cūninge / that you can fynde no∣ne so worthy a patrone / to whome ye may dedicate the first frutes of your fantasy as not only to a Queen / but also to a vir∣gin Queen / as by the end of youre prefa∣ce more playnly apereth.Martins fil∣thi and vnchast talke in his boke dedicated to the Queen. Not doutin∣ge belyke the offending of her graces ea¦res with your vngodly and vnchast beast∣lynes and raylinge. As when you vse the termes of detestable bawdry / of stinkinge lechory / of beastly bichery / of concubines and of common strumpets / of lecherose ād filthy beastes / and of your heathenishe ru¦ffianlyke
/ and abhominable talke in abu¦singe the words Carnis resrrectionem.Martins be∣astli abusin∣ge of a peece of the crede in his book, fol. lxvij. .i. the resurrection of the flesh / beinge a necessary article of euery Christian mans faith / to the stirring vp of nature in mans body / neyther with an infinite number / of such lyke and more wicked tearmes / with whose rehersall I am more then as∣hamed to occupy my penn / but th t is meet your lewdnes should some thing be knowen and disclosed. Neyther do you think belike that she wold be offendid with youre shameles shiftes / vnder the protection of her name / nor with your e∣uydent wrasting of the trueth / and most manifest and open lyes / aswell apon the holy and sacred Word of the euerliuinge god / as of the learned fathers / and aunce  wryters / and old Can̄ons in the church of god / of whiche lyes / flaunders / sleig∣tes / wicked / and vngodly raylinges nly and of nothinge els / the whole bo∣y of youre booke is raked vp together as  stincking dunghill that is heaped of undry soartes of filth. Oh lord / is ho∣estie so muche decaed / that any mā dar¦th be so bold to occupy the chast eares of ny Christen creature / but chefely of a
Queen with suche whorishe ād ethnicall talke? whither hath thy boldnes caried the Martyn? Seest thow not / that sha¦me hath not made the shrynke / to seeke for defence of thy beastlynes at the hand of the chefe power? No mā lyuinge (that conceaueth good opinion of her grace) can thinke other wise / then that ether she neuer red thy booke / or that she will not suffer thy boldnes to goe vnpunished. But be it that she wold / yet assuer thy self of this / though she of her fauor towards the / will wīk at thy wickednes / say what thow shalt / yet will God and all god∣ly learned men / ouerloke both the and thy doinges / and know by that thow sa∣iest what maner of mā thow semest to be / ād iudge by that thow shuldest say / what maner of man thow oughtest to be. Thy boke hath betrayed the Martyn / for thy fondnes / was not knowen befor it came abrode / but assone as that shewed it self in mens hands / they might easely perce∣aue / Martin used erely to play the fole at Chri∣stmas in newe Colledge in Ox¦d. that in playnge the Christmas lords minion in new colledge in Oxford / in thy foles coat that thow didest learne thy boldnes / and lost thy witt / and began to
ut of all shame and to put on all impu∣encye. Thus beinge indewed with the ery properties of Martion the aunce nt Archeretique / and enemy to all Matrimonie (with whōe thoughe thow gree somwhat in name / yet is that agre¦ent muche more in opinion (as in pro∣es by Gods grace I shall plainly pro∣e) thow thinkest thow maist play thy arte abrode now / as thow diddest at ho¦e then. But when thy folowers and auorers shall eftsones perceaue / that hey shall be accessary to thy folly / if thy olours being disclosed / they continew in attery of thy doings: Then shame / if hey be not past shame / shall make them rynke from the / and dryue them to la∣ent both their owne case and thyne / for ffering affection so to blynde their ey∣s / that amongst so many wyse men hey haue folwed such a fole. None that ueth the Queen can think that she co∣ld read thy boke without blushing chee¦es / wherfore reason semeth to say that auinge no leasure her self / she causid thy ok to be perused bi sōe other / apō whose porte if they were hōest mē / and not her atterers / or thy folowers (as many of
them be that remaine about her) thy boke should neuer haue ben alowed / for uoyding rebuke that therby might reound to her grace herafter: Orels if  pleasure were that this euell argumen against the holy matrimony of preste should goe abrode vnd her defence / th then the same / thoughe it be an euell mter / shuld haue as good a visor put apo it as might be / and that in suche sorte a thoughe the world that now is / may peceaue how by zeale se is caried to fa superstition / The Queen ought to ae heed of filthi pirits. yet that the posteritie which shall folow this age might vnderstan she reioiseth not in such vyle and filth spirites / thoughe lyeng were alowed  reason of her ignoraunce. In this  all other things her grace may doe wh it lusteth so farr and so long as God  permitte and suffer / but your raylings  lyes may not be left vntouched / thoug your book were tenn tymes dedicate to Queē / lest through your falshod and ly trueth it self might either be hyd or hurt Wherfore I will presently turne my  from your preface to the tytell off your  / for youre preface is nothinge ells  paper full off poyson prepared to infect
rinces eares. The matter therin con∣yned I will differr to be answerd in he body of my boke / where it shalbe eui¦ently declared that all your promesses ere made be lyes / all your reasons ray∣ngs / all your wisdom wranglinge / and ll your doings / deceytfull. The Second chapter. An examination of the tytell of Mar∣ns book / wherin is proued by sundry easons of the scriptures / and auncient Doctours / that the mariadge of priests after priesthod / is not only a mariad∣ge / but also is lawful and godly.Martin pro∣messeth much but performeth nothing. THe tytell of your bok is not vnlike to a Tauerners wyne bushe hanged out for a shew / wher ther is not one rop of wyne / or at the least way of no ood wyne in the Cellar. For as the bus∣e maketh the people beleue / that som∣hat is there / whiche in deed is not: So  it with the tytell of your booke / and al  with euery chapter in the first leaf ta∣ed For the reader shall well perceaue at no one thinge in the whole booke is ewly performed / that gloriosli in the yttell of the same without feare is pro∣essed. The triall wherof shalbe pro∣ued
in my proces. But one thing in thi first frunt I may not wel omitt / becaus in youre Tytell of youre booke it is so ntoriose / and in your body of the same /  whit remembred. wherby it may appeare how trew you be of youre promesses the tytell of your book saith that it is.The Tytell of Martins book A Treatise declaringe and plainly pruinge that the pretensed mariadge  priestes and professed parsons / is no mriadge but altogether vnlaufull / etc. Note good reader that Martin saiet not only that the mariadges of preest be euell and vnlawfull mariadges / bu he saieth plainly that they be no mariadges.That the mari∣adge of priests be not only ma∣riadges but also good and law∣full. I pray you master Doctour (if  may be so bold with you) answer me b your law without Sophistry / (for you logique is so litell that no man nedeth  regarde it / and your diuinitie much less as your book beareth witnes.) Answ me I say by your law if you haue any /  this reason: where there is no mariad there nedeth no diuorse / Martyn con∣futed by the Queens proce¦dings. but the procdings off the Queen and the bushope and of all the lawiers in England declare that a diuorse is nedefull off priests ∣riadge before they be again admitted
ministery / or that the wyf may marry : Ergo the Queen the bushopes  all the lawiers in England conclude  priests mariadge is a mariadge /  to your resolution: my reason  apon this ground. Priuatio ante requi∣abitum. The taking away of a thin∣ presupposeth that such a thinge there . And the breaking of a knot /  that there was a knot in all  mens iudgements / I know not  it doth in youres. And that such a  was nedefull the lawiers them  declare / grauntinge that such a so∣pne act as matrimonie is / can not  another solempne act be vndon  / wherof the lerned lawiers were  ignoraunt though it be french or he∣w to you. Secondarylye. Yf the mariadge of  priests in England were no mariad∣ then is there diuorse no diuorse: for if  a mariadge ād a diuorse it foloweth  they be all gods enemies who either  or suffre in England priests  to mary againe other huszbāds  the diuorse is not for adultery. Thurdly Yow popishe Heretiques
say that mariadge is a Sacrament of  new Testament though in deed it wer stituted in paradise before Adams trgression / Martin se∣meth not to ag∣ree with the rest of the pa∣pists. and therwith also you maintne and defend that Sacramenta conferunt  ex opere operato. the Sacraments  grace by vertew of the worke wught. And apon that ground ye Chris bells / D. stksley busp of londō Christenid a cat and churches / etc. as D. Stokley bushop of London Christened a  wherof by tryall king Hēry the viij.  assuerid.The papists grant Christen∣dom to bellis / and deny ma∣riadge to priests But if this being (as ye  it) a Sacrament of the new Testam and ministred by a minister to a priest a maiden / be not able to make a marige / then shuld not Sacraments confe grace ex oere operato .i. by the work  / whiche amonge the Papists  great absurditie and inconuenience.

That is)  there be an inuocation or a callinge  the name of god / the very inuocatiō it  sanctifieth and maketh holy that whi

Whiche words of tatus by you (though in other matter roued / whom also I most gladli alow)  playnly that if the mariadge of  were a thinge vncleane (whiche  ut heretiques durst euer to say) yet be  same by meanes of the inuocacion of  holy name made cleane puer and  your ground be good which I haue  / that the Sacraments do confer  by the work wrought / Clemens Ale∣xand. in his iiij. book. . but what wor your groūds be / this must be trewe  it is sanctified by the word of God  praier / as I shall hereafter shew mo lainly in whiche sense Clemens . 4. . taketh it saiēg: That  iadge is made holy whiche is conclu¦ by the ministery of Gods word / Pope Syriti∣us against Martyn thou¦gh / he be our ene¦my.

after Christe sayeth. Tanta est uis in Sacra∣mento Coniugij,Mariadge ma¦de after the vow must be kept though the vow be broken. ut nec ex uiolatione uoti potest dissolui ipsum coniugium: So great a strenght is in the Sacra∣ment of matrimonye that the mariadge can not be dissolued after the breche of the vow.Epiphanius a greke wryter a∣gainst Martin 375. yere after Christ. Note the ter∣mes reader e∣cundum legem a votary may take a wyfe ac∣cording to the law. Item Epiphanius contra Catharos haeresi 59. speking of them that haue made a vow / and afterward turn to mariadge / sayth. Melius est lapsum à cursu palam sibi uxo∣rem sumere secundum legem, & sic rursus ad Ec∣clesiam induci, uelut qui mala operatus est, qui lapsum & fractum, & obligatione opus habentm, & non quotidie occultis iaculis sauciari ab impro∣bitate quae ipsis à Diabolo infertur. Yt ts better (saieth he) for him tha is fallen in his course (meaning them that can not continew in the thinge that they haue vowed) to take a wife openly ac∣cordinge to the law / The mariadge of a priest made after his vow is good. and so to be restored to the church again (as one that before hath done euell / as one that hath fal∣len / and hath been broken / and hath now need to be bounde) and not dayly to be inwardly wounded by secret dar∣tes wher with the deuell continualy doth
assault them. Lo here Epiphā. doth  only alow mariadges of priests and votries before priesthode and vowinge / bu also after priesthod and vowing / and na¦meth the mariadge done in such case laufull / ād that mariadge after there vow  broken / is a meane to restore them again to the churche / if they were fallen from  by breakinge of there vow. So that yo se by Ep. iudgement / that the mariadge of priests euen after there vow is not ōly a mariadge but also a lawfull mariadge.mariadge after the vow is law full by Epiph. And this place of Ep. answereth fully a other places of him which by Martyn and other Papists be wrythed to the contrary. Item Saint Austen in his boke de bono uiduitatis maketh a plain resoluti∣on in this matter aswell against Martī / as against all the rest of the popishe rout in Christendome / where speaking of thē that mari after they haue vowed / he saith in plain words / Non ipsae nuptiae uel taliū dam nandae iudicantur / (that is) the mariadge euen of such as marry after they haue vo¦wed are not to be condempned.Saint Austen against Mar∣tin / falsified by Pighius. This pla∣ce of S. Austen is falsified by Pighi∣us controuers .15. wher for (uel talium he hath crafftily put in (uelut malum) wherapō the whole matter standeth. Oh false papist.
And a litle after S. Aug. saieth. Proinde ui talium nuptias dicunt non esse nuptias,That the mari∣adge after the vow broken is a good mariad∣ge plainly pro∣ued by S. Austen. sed poti s adulteria, non mihi uidētur satis accurate & dili genter considerare quid dicant, fallit quippe eos imilitudo ueritatis etc. and shorthly after he saieth. Fit autem per hanc minus consideratam opinionem, qua putant lapsarum à sancto proposi∣o foeminarum, si nuperint non esse coniugia, nō paruum malum, ut à maritis separentur uxores quasi adulterae sint, non uxores: & cum uolunt e∣as separatas, reddere continentiae, faciunt maritos earum adulteros ueros, cum suis uxoribus uiuis, ali as duxerint &c. The English of all this to¦gether is this.Saint Austen saith that the Papists know not what thei say. wherfore they that say the mariadge of suche (meāing of them that marry after they haue vowed) is no mari¦adge but rather adultery / me semeth they do not advisedly and diligently enough cōsider what they say / for they be decea∣ued by an apparance of trueth for by the means of that folishe opiniō wherby they thinke the mariadge of suche professed women as haue forsakē there vow / is no mariadge if they mary / Here be Mar∣tins very wo∣rds confuted by Saint Austen there commeth no small inconuenience. which inconuen¦ience is this wyues be separate frō their husbands as thoughe they were whores ād not wyues. And when they will resto¦re the divorsed to sole life / there husbāds
are cōpelled to be veri adulterers / whē th¦re owne wyues beinge alyue they marr other husbāds. Here thow seest Marti cōfutid by S. Austens own words Whche  do not only make a plaine confutation prouinge first that priests mariadge be mariadges / but agreinge fully wi  Epiphanius and the rest by me before alledged / they also declare Saint Austen mynde that such mariadges as be mad after priesthode / be good and lawfu mariadges / And that there wyues in sche case be there lawfull wyues / be ther  own wyues / and that there wyues be n whores / And that it is not lawfull so t diuorse the parties that either of the  may marry other parsons. Yea and i the same place / Saint Austen answeret there fond obiection which say that votaies  be maried to Christe / ād therfore they can not marry againe / whiche in this place I will leaue owt / least I shuld be tedise / mynding hereafter to alledge this place more largelie / Saint Austen saieth they be de¦ceaued which hold opinion that priests or voaies may nt many. for satisfinge of such as think we haue nothinge in the old Doc∣tors that maketh for our purpose. But one thinge I pray the gentle reader / be∣fore thow forsake this peece off Saint
Austen Consider how earnestly in this my allegacion Saint Austen chargeth our aduersaries with dulnes and ignor∣aunce / Consider how he tanteth them as talkers they wot not what / Consider how in plain words he sayth they be deceauid. And when thow shalt reade or heare them bringe in Saint Austē against vs / set the reason of Saint Austen to make them answer / and if they will not / with this reason be satisfied: Then let them harken to Saint Austen where he saieth they be vnlerned and without aduisemēt / and that they say they wot not what. Now leauinge the confutacion of Mar¦tin any further in this point by aunceāt counsels and Doctours / I haue thought good to confute him also by the sacred scriptures of God. Out of whiche one or two reasons / shall suffice for this present because habundance off matter otherwi∣se hath made me tary so long about so lit¦le.11.1. Tim. 4. Saint Paule 1. Timoth. 4. speaking of mariadge and meats sayth thus.Martin confu¦ted by the scripture. Euery creature of God is good to the faithfull ād none is to be refused being taken with thanks geuinge / for it is sanctified by the word off God and praier. This maior or ground we haue
haue of Saint Paule / whereunto I add this minor or meane proposition. But mariadge is a creature of god / that I am suer yow can not denye / onles you will say mariadge is a creature of the deuell as the old heretiques Saturninus Basilides and there folowers did.The heretiques Saturninus and Basilides wer enemies of mariadge read / Theod. lib 1. de Haereticis fab▪ Wherupon must folow this conclusion / Ergo mariadge is good and not to be refused being takē with thanks geuinge for it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. This sound Sylogismus proueth plainly that the mariadge of a prest is not only a ma∣riadge / but also a good mariadge / and a  good thinge for it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. Wherby Mar∣tins assertion (that it is no mariadge) is fully ouerthrowen.2. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. Yea and Saint Pau¦le calleth the bushop / priest / and deacon / by the name of huszband / and there ioke∣fellowes  by the name of wyues / and saith the bushop must be the huszband of one wife / and like wise the deacon.1. Corinh. 7. And fur∣ther he saieth for the avoydinge of forni∣eacion let euery man haue his wife etc.  In which generall sentence / priests must be comprehendid / if they be men. Yea and there mariadge not only a mariadge but also an honorable mariadge or els cā not
mariadge be honorable in all estates / as Saint Paule wryteth to the hebrues the 13. Chap.Heb. 13▪ And I pray you what neded you to make more adoe / if priests mariad¦ge were no mariadge? what neded an act of Parliament / in the first yere of the Queēs reigne to repeale the statute ma∣de for priests mariadges? And why doth that act name it the mariadge of priests / ād not a pretēsed mariadge / as yow doe∣reuokynge the mariadges by the name of mariadges / and not of pretensed mari¦adges? And last of all / yf prests mari¦adge be no mariadge as you say: what cause I pray you had the Queen and the bushopes to depriue the maried busho∣pes and priests of England from there be¦nefices? They were not depriued for ig∣noraunce in Gods worde / neyther for not doing there dewtie / nor for glutony / nor swearinge / nor diszing / nor huntinge / nor buggery / nor whoredome / for these be cō∣mon faultes amōgst all your priests now a daies / And a benefice and any of them / or all of thē be so compatible / and may so well be enioyed together / that any popish priest may quietly haue those faults an there benefice together wthout depriuati¦on. Other fault there is none knowen /
but only that they were maried / The maried priests of Eng∣land were depri¦ued without a cause. thoughe for the lawfulnes of there mariadge be∣syds Gods plaine word and godly Can∣nons and Doctours / etc. They had the consent of the kinge the supreame head vnder Christ of the churche and of the par¦lament and realme / an d that oyned with the consent of the congregacions assem∣bled where they were maried / and for the testimony of the kings consent and oth∣ers both of the nobles and commons / The maried priests had the consent of the Kinge the Par¦liament / and the Realme. for lawfulnes therof / many of them receauid benefices after they were maried / at the kings and other nobles hands. All this lawfulnes notwithstandinge I say other cause haue ye none wherfore ye depryued the priests of England from there bene∣fices but only that they were maried. Now cum you forth and say that the pretentid mariadge of priests is no ma∣riadge. wherfore it must folow that the pretendid cause in England of priests di¦uorsement is no cause / ād that the priests be put from there liuings without a cau¦se / euen by your own supposall / if the ma¦adge of priests be but pretensid (as you put it) how much more then without a cause / being very mariadge in deed? as is prouid / and without controuersy a∣mongst
men of knowledge / and vnder∣andinge / euen of your own sort / as is be re shewed: Yf therfor without a cau∣ / then be they / either way / both by your d supposall / & in very deed / the trew pos¦essours of there benefices still / though ther by iolēce & extorsiō enioy the pro¦fets of there possessions. whom I wold should right well note that like s princes and rulers be subiect to chaū¦ges / and that death assone knocketh at he doer of the riche as of the pooer: So a mans right dieth not. And law in a∣nother world will charge the transgres∣or / The Papists be extorsioners. thoughe case in this world so flatter the conscience / that God is for gotton ād the flesh make full mery. what is extorsi¦on? if this be not extorsion? to put out of goods and liuings one without a cause / and to thrust in another without a iust ty¦tell? But all this cannot suffice you / on∣es ye may please your throte and eares / with cryeng out vpon vs / thees / hereti∣ques & Traytours / etc. When you haue taken frō vs both our cuntry / our goods / & most lawfull possessions. Yea and all that we haue sauinge God alone / whom with his word ye haue left to vs / & dry∣uen away from you / to our comfort and your eternall shame & perpetuall infamy▪
But to returne againe to the Tytell  Martins boke / I thinke it sufficientl prouid / that the mariadge of a priest  professed parson is a mariadge (to th open shame of Martin and his fauorer aswell by argumēts deduced out of God worde / and manifest authorities out  old Doctors both greke and Latin / and testimonies of the popes themselues and of there own lawes / as by the uery procdings of the Queen and the bushopes i England in these present daies. And by the way also it may somwhat appeare by the iudgement of Epiphāius / and Saint Austen etc. that the same mariadge / is not only a mariadge / but also good / lau∣full / and godly. which point I thought requisite somwhat to touch in the begin∣ninge / for satisfieng of suche as either wold gladly / but yet haue no leasure to re¦ad all the rest of the proces folowinge▪ or els of suche as wold fayne haue there hunger easid with sumwhat in the begin¦inge / wherby the payn of expectacion for the rest might be / though not vtterly ta∣ken away / yet some parte aswagid. Now will I searche what Martin sayth in his first chapter / which beginneth on this wyse.
The third chapter. The beginning of Martins first chapter  confuted and his sleight in makinge false grounds is disclosed. If the fellowship and company of a wo¦man be in a spirituall man a mean to perfect religion / etc.Martins words. Because in your oke almost vniuersaly you abuse to a ronge sence / Martins fleight in vsing words that ma be diuersly ta∣ken to a wrong sence. sondry words which may e ambiguosly taken / and so by equiuoca¦ion and Sophisticall deceyt deceaue the eader / as the termes / Chastitie / virgini∣ie / mariadge / whoredome / heresye / here∣que / Lechory / Churche / Traditionn / Coū¦els / Doctours / vniuersall cōsent / vowes Iudgement / Spirituall men / Carnall men / and a great nomber of suche lyke I halbe otenfymes forced for the help of he vnaquaynted reader / (least he be car∣ed away with such Sophisticall sleyghts and deceytfull practises into the opinion off you Papists / ): to opē the same words by playn distinction / as place shall requy∣r / that the falshod taught by the Papists and the Catholique doctrine taught by
and his Apostels and vs / may more euidently she i self and apeare. wherin thughe I sha smtyme trauaile more largely then shall seem nedefull for answe yet dout I nothinge but that I shall deserue pardō of the reader / because it sha by Gods help / not be without some profet / for in this discourse I mynd not to iyn with Martin alone (being a mā as  semeth altogether ignorāt in diuinitie  not ōly the author but rather the pen̄er o this blasphemose booke) but with all th of rest the popishe sect / who haue bene ei∣ther his helpers in it / or maynteiners o the lyke heretical opiniōs. After this ad∣uertisemēt / the reader shall note / that th cōmon practise of Martin & suche as he be / The craft off you papists is to mae false grounds and to wyth the mynd of the wryters is / to make the ground and foundaciō of there reasons apon words ād sentēces either of there own fantasying / vsing thē as things allredy prouid: or els wrythed far from the mynde of the speaker and wryter for the maintenaunce of there manifest heresies and blasphemies / which craft of theres is both profittable and necessary to be disclosed / Martin abu∣seth the name of a spiritua man to deceaue the reader. wherfore in the very first beginninge of this chapter I maie not suffer Martin to turn the name of a Spirituall man / away from all maried men to the only shauen and popishe ge∣acion.
For the reader shall vnder∣nd that all be spirituall men which be with Gods spirite.Rom. 8. 1. Corin. 2. And he who hath re habundance of Gods spirite is  pirituall.What is a spi∣rituall man▪ Of a like mānor Saint Pau peaking to the maried sort in Rome as ll as to the rest / said uos non esis in carne, in spiritu: yow be not in the flesh but in  spirite:Iohann. . And Saint Ihon in his  chapter nameth all to bee spirituall  beleue in Christ / for fleshe and bloud not able to bring forth such a spirituall . And if the outward admission were ble to make a man spirituall / than  Iudas and such lyke / who had the ward election (yet inwardly folowed  spirit of the flesh / Spirituall. and the deuill) be rthyly called spirituall / But our Saui¦ Christ reasoning with Nicodem ma∣th a play profe by euident demonstra∣n that only sch as be indewed with ds spirit / Iohannis. 3. be worthy of the name Spiri¦all / ād that such as be no born of Gods rit / be not spirituall / but carall.A maried man my be a spiri∣tuall man. And the same place the lord hath geuen a nnerall resoltion that no man can en∣ the kingdom of heauē /  he becom pirituall ma /  be born a new not on f water / but  of the holy .
Wherfore yf it were trew that the clar that lacke wiues were the onely spiritu sort (as Martī here taketh it) thē shou all the maried people aswell Papistes  other / Martins doc∣trine robeth all maried men of the spirite of god 2. cor. 6. aswell kīges / Princes / as other al sortes / lose the benifite of regeneraciō and be excluded from Gods holy comfo and being men not spirituall (as Mart termeth them) should be vnmete templ in whome gods spirite myght dwell / a finally vnable to entre the kyngdome heauen. But the scriptures of God kno no suche distinction betwene the spiritua and the temporall or worldly / as the Ppistes haue fantasyed and deuysed therto increase amongest the people the cred of heire shauen and wiueles generacio whome onely they cal spirituall where a they be onely spirituall / secundum quid / th is notte in deade but abusiue / they be call spirituall for theyr aparell / and office / b otherwise altogether carnall. But in th point the papists agree fully with the  heritiques named Massiliās / The agremente of the papystes with the hereti∣ques named . or in gre  who would not lay theyr hād to a kynde of labor / and their reason was ( Theodoret witnesseth / lib 4) because th named them selues  (that is  say) spirituall menn / excluding all go
enne from that name (spirituall) as the apystes doe. Martins reason runneth  as though that a man can not be a spi∣ituall man who hath a wyfe.Mart. holdeth that mariadg vnclennes  temporalye. pes Can such talke tend to any other ende hen that mariadge is vnclennes euen in hem that be no priests: you wold thinke araduenture that no suche absurdite can asse Martins pen / but as ye shall finde he same in sondry other places so shall ye inde it speciallye in sence / aswell in the 20 eafe where he aleadgeth that mariadge was diswaded by Constantine: as in the 8. leafe pag 2. Wher he maketh a loud lie of the scrip∣tures inforcinge himeselfe to proue it / Martin belieth the scripture. by these wordes where he saieth. The scrip∣tures cal it in a maried man vnclennes to ye with his owne wife.Saint Paul sayth Heb. xiii. the maried mās bed is cleā and Martin saieth contrary that it is vncleane. By the whiche wordes ye maye see what a lying beaste Martin is / for it is euidēt that the scrip∣tures in the 13 to the Heb. doe call the ma¦ried mās beed  an vndefiled bed / a pure / a clean / and an vnspotted bed and suche a bedde / as a spirituall manne that is to saye any manne who is indued with Goddes spirite (as I haue declared maye lie in. Yea suche a bedde as he must
and as he is commannded to lye in / All such as ha∣ue t the guift of  f be cō∣maūded by S. Paule to may. yf haue not the guift of sole life / as by mafest and plain words / Saint Paule bdeth and chargeth sainge  the Imperatiue mode / . / Yf they refrain not / them marry / or (as if he shuld say) I cmaund them to marry.Mat. xix. Ep. iiij. j. Cor. vij. Which commadement is not geuen by Saint Paule suche men as haue cast away the feare God / but to suche as be indewed  Gods spirite / and therfore spiritual Howbeit as no one spirituall mā hath  spirituall gyftes / but eueryman hath  proper or seuerall gyft of God / this  thus / ād another man otherwyse: so hat not euery spirituall man the gyft of  lyfe as Christ witnesseth Matth. 19.  for that cause is the holy state of matrimny ordeined / that such as haue not th gyft of virginitie may lyue in that hol state / without departing from the perfection of a Christen man. Which saying semeth to Martin a great absurditie.  Saint Paule (ye see by his commaundment) is of this mynde.Clemens Alex∣andrinus , li. 7. And Clemens Alādrinus (who wrote about 220 yeres afte Christ (descrybing the parfect Christiā  spirituall mā / sayth amōg other properties
/ . that is that  doth eat / and drink / & marieth a wi∣e: & for a profe of his saying he addeth / Mariadge is cleannes. hat the perfect Christiā may boldly / may  for asmuch as e hath (saith he) The Apostles for his example / The Apostels had wyues. Signifieng & declaring ther∣by both the cleanes of mariadge and that the Apostels had wiues. And the uery sa¦me sayng in effect he hath in his third bo¦ke of the sāe argumēt / whose uery words as they be wrytten in grek I will differr vntill another place where they shall ser∣ue this aswell as other purposes. In this matter more profes be not requisite / con¦sideringe the clearnes of this doctrine a∣greeth fully with the preachinge of the most aunceant Doctours and wryters / whom Martins rayling tonge accusing vs / calleth with vs / new procedinge prea¦chers: And yet somwhat more then ned∣eth is not vnnedefull for such as be so far¦re gon as nothinge allmost will bringe them back again / whom I would therfo¦re should harken a litle further. Yf a man should demand of S. Paule why he gaue this com̄aundemēt of mari¦adge to suche as had receaued gods spirit
and haue not the gyft of sole lyfe? Can  think he wold make any other answer  that whiche he hath allready made?. Corin. 7. whi is melius est nubere quàm uri .i. it is better mary then to burn?Martyn is a∣gainst S. Pau¦le. wherupon it folowe that Saint Paules iudgement is contrry to Martyns: for by this his answer it plain that the fellowship and company  woman is a mean to a spirituall man stey him in the perfection of Christs relion.Mariadge hel¦peth the godly man that hath not the gyft of sole lyfe to the state of perfecti¦on. And that a single and a wyueles ly to such men as haue not the gyft of abstinence / is not a mean to continew the spiritall man in the same perfection / but rathe a means to bringe him to burning and destruction: And it must also folow / that  the second parte of Martins first condicionall / he maketh a lowd lye / sainge. Yf th fellowship and company of a woman be  a spirituall man a mean to perfect religion / etc. Then Christs holy Apostels and the aunceant fathers of the churche hau taught vs a wrong doctrine. For it is prouid both that the company of a wyfe or (a Martin frowardly termeth it) of a woman is a helping mean to make that man per∣fect in religion who being without a wife & laking that gyft / Gen. . hath an imperftion Of this doctrine almightie God is a wit∣nes
saying / let vs mak to mā a helper: Martyn holdeth that God made to him a hynderer. And that this is no wrong doctrin but a trew taught by Christ and his apostels: Thesome of that I haue said may be knit vp in this brefe reason thus. Saint Paule (as Ihaue alledged) gaue suche in commaundement / as cold not absteyn / to marry.A Syllogisme But S. Paule commaundid nothinge that might hin∣er the perfection of a Christian mans re∣ligion. Ergo mariadge is no hinder∣aunce to the perfection of a Christē mans religion. Yet then procedeth Martin further on the other side / Martyn bey∣et the preathers in kyng Ed∣wards dayes. beginning with a (but) and proceding with an (Yf) inferring cō¦sequently two suppositions / and would therby induce the reader first to beleue that somme in England haue taught in king Edwars dayes the som̄e of our reli¦gion to stand in wiuing. And then secon∣daryly he sayth that Christ alowed suche as absteyn from mariadge thoughe they haue not the gyft. What some haue ta∣ught I can not say but this I am able to say / that it was no doctrine generally alo¦wed / Therfore because both the suppositi¦ons be most manifestly false it may well
appeare that Martin and his fellowe  seek nothing but matter wherupon  wrangle / as the godly preachers in kinge Edwards dayes / sought nothinge mre then to set furth the playne trueth and the lawfull / and honorable Chastitie of mariadge / how so euer Martin vnchaste tonge / is not ashamed to babell▪ And when he hath raylyd a whyl euen in the very beginninge of his book then he departeth from suppositions to fayer and at lyenge / lest all the body beinge made of lyenge and raylyng should lack a head / lyke vnto it self. These be his words. The fourth chapter. That the hypocrisy of the Papists hath and doth deceaue all men contra¦ry to Martins asserti∣on / etc. Martin.YF a man will way the matter indif¦ferently the opinion of such can em¦ploy no suspicion of vntreuth / whi∣che
whiche seke nothing but austeritie of lyfe and theyr own paine. I marueile muche that Martin is not ashamed to commend his fonde opinion / Winchester. with the fained austeritie & sharpnes of the fatte bellied Priees whom he wold seeme to defende.The whole stu∣dy of the Pa∣pists is to incre¦ase ther plesures and to maintai∣ne belly fare. All the world seeth that there hole lyf is spent allmost in nothin∣ge els then in eating and drinkinge / in ydell walkinge and pastymes / ād in pro¦uidinge for furringe of there bak / and fattinge of there belly / and in gorgeosly deckid chambers / and soft slepinge. For maintenaunce wherof I report me to all the world what paynes they take in pur¦chasinge pluralities / tot quots non resy∣dences / etc. that they may heap prebend apon prebend / and benefice apon benefi∣ce / least at any tyme there back / or there belly / should lack of there lust.Some papistes win the hares of the peple with gluttonye. Fearin∣ge least ther spare godly dyet should cau∣se there neighbours to call them nigards Knowinge that belly fare is a better meanes to wyn the harts of the ignorāt and common peple / then is the doctrine of the punishement of the body and of the austeritie of lyf. And knowing also / that he shall be praysed for good / thoughe he be neuer so euell / Yf he

I pray the Martyn what kind of peple haue more deceaued the world then suche as haue colorid there naughtines with austeritie of lyfe / The preense of hard lyf hath de¦ceaued all Chri¦stendom. and seme t differ from other in outward state? Th Phariseis / the Esseis / & such lyke heretiques / who trubled the church of God both before and in Christs tyme / who wre more commendid of the peple for ther austeritie of lyfe then they?The practises wherby the old heretiques gat¦ther estimacion. and who we∣re worse? The aunceant heretiques in the begin̄inge of the churche for the most parte did wyn̄ ther first estimation: some  by abhorring all Mariadges / saynge they were vnclean and deuelishe as Sa∣turninus  and Basilides / etc.Ireneus. Some (of whome Ireneus writeth) that thei ab∣horred mariadges / Speakinge a∣gainst mariad∣ge / brought the old heretiques in to estimatiō. and absteyned from flesh / huiusmodi continentia seducentes multos .i. seducinge many with suche continency and refrayninge.

How a strayte lyfe deceaueth the peple it is in a bok ascribid to Saint Austen plentifully declared in the 21. Ser¦mon ad Fratres in Heremo speakinge a∣mongest other things of the heretiques that were callid Sarabaitae /Saint Austen ad  in e∣remo semo xxj. and these be his words.

Hos obsecro nolite imitari, & caetera. That is to say.The hypocrisie of the Hereti∣ques named Sarabaits sy to the hypociy of the Papists. Such were the Heretiques callid Sarahaitae of whome ther Hierom hath wryten to vs this hird tyme. Whose fashion is by all eans to be a voyded. They abode in Egipt in caues of rockes / clothed only ith the skins of swyne and oxenn / & ere gyrdid with withes of palme trees nd being bare fotid they tyed thornes o there gyrdels which knockid and ricked them apon the heeles / and they ent out all blody to Hierusalem to he feast of Tabernacules / and enteringe he holy of the holyest / they did preach he obseruation of pouertie and abstin∣nce with all affection. Who wold not iudge these men holly? They pullid of the heare of there beards  the sight of the peple / and so gettinge
boeth fame and vantage / they return home priuily / reioysyng and banketing aboue measure. I would faine learne Martin nowe whether austeritie of li that is contrary to the commen vsag eploye suspycion of vntruth or not / by t iudgdment of this author? A strait life  good when it is ioyned with a treuth /  it was in holy Ihon Baptiste / etc. B whē a strait life is ioyned with a falshod as it is in all the popes creatures and ther sectaries and heritiques / the mebres of Antichrist:The holy mayd of ymster / Sir Thomas more. The holy mayd of kent. ther is nothing mo perilous then straitenes of lyfe. Wh lecherose lyfe led the holy maide of Lymster pretending her foode to bee nothing els but the masse caake.

Wh bawdry practised the holy? nay the deueshe mayde of kent / with Monks fryer and preests vnder the color of strayt nunishe lyfe / as appereth partly by the act o parliament / but more largely in the boke of her lyf? And within this eight yere was there not a holy mā named maiste Doctour boord a Phisicion that thryse i the week would drink nothinge but water / The chastite of Do. boord the Papist discoue¦uered at Win∣chester. such a proctour for the Papists thē as Martyn̄ the lawier is now?

Whose opinion was that we should liue in the earth pleasantly a 1000. yeares not in these daies / and before our death or before oure resurrecciō / but that after our
resurrection we shuld eat and drink and marri / and cease from offeringe bulles & ram̄es & other sacrifices: with the which opinion Saint Hierom in the same pla∣ce chargeth Tertulian, Lactantius and Irenaeus and other mani of the old fathers who wre not without their errours being men / that Saint Hierom ād the ould wryters declare that Cerinthus was not condempnid for allowinge of lawfull mariadge in this lyfe / as Martin out of Eusebius contrary to the mynde of other Doctours wold seem to proue / nor yet for alowing of bawdry vnder the color of matrymony as his tonge most vnhonestly delyteth to terme it.Theodoret lib ij . But for that he taught a new earthly kingdom of Christe / and of a new Hierusalem after our resurrection as Theodoret wryteth / wherin we should eat and drink & marry / in the lyfe to cum (I say) and not in the lyfe present. Wher¦by ye may easely iudge how this allegaci¦on maketh nothing for Martins purpo¦se.Martyn confir¦meth ne lye with nother. Whiche was also fearid (as it should seem) of Martin / and therfore he confir∣meth his matter with āother lye saying. And therfore Cerinthus made a gener∣all doctrine that men should satisfie the∣re
fleshly prouocations by eating and rinkinge and marieng. This is one of Martins shameles lyes / for neither was hat the opinion of Cerinthus (as I ha∣e declarid) nether doth the old wryters o report it / so that in this place Mar∣ins lye is manifest. But one thinge I hall desier the to note in this allegacion hat he reporteth not Cerinthus / to satis∣fie his fleshly prouocations by eatinge & drinking and whoredom: But by eatin∣ge and drinkinge and mariadge.Martin seketh meanes how to bring the holy state of matri∣mony in to con∣tempt. Wher∣by the reader may see that Martin wold fayne haue mariadge allowed by a gene∣rall doctrin of Cerinthus the heretique / purposly wrything Eusebius from the con∣sent of the other oulde Doctours / that he might haue som color therby to condem∣pne mariadge / as a thinge by some here∣tique approuid. Wherby thow mayst learn good reader / that no doctrine is so false / no opinion so perelose / no blasphe∣my so horrible / but Martyn wold admitt it / so that he might therbi hauesome help wherwith to bark against the mariadge of priests. And in deed if he could brin∣ge the profe to passe that all mariadges were vncleane & wicked / as by this his
allegacion of Eusebius he semeth to intend then shoulde his conclusion easely folow A genere ad speciem uniuersaliter / that also th mariadge of priestes were vncleane an wicked: but this maior neither Martī / nether neuer a papist that euer was / shalb hable to proue / Note therfore good read howe busilye Martin laboreth to gett him some maiors / and groundes / for th maintenaunce of his wicked purpose. Whiche when he fyndeth good / he failet in the profe of hys minor or meane proposicion: and being false (as ye se this is he not onelye leaseth his laboure: but also sheweth himselfe what an enemie he is to the treuth. when of purpose by vntreuthe he seketh the maintenaunce of his deue∣lishe opinion.That Ioui∣nian was nott the frst heritique that preached in Rome contra∣rie to Martin. And to amende this matter withall / by and by Martin com∣meth forth with Another lye / sayinge. That Iouinian the monke was the firste heritique that preached in Rome. Another lie of Martin.For yf it be trewe that Peter was at Rome and disputed there with Simon Magus as Eusebius, Epiphanius, Irenaeus, and other do witnesse. And also that Simon Magus (docuit) taught there / as Iraeneus witnesseth / and further that he hadde so perswaded the Romains
wyth hys doctrine that they reysed vp a piller in his honoure / with this writing vpon it:Irenaeus lib. 2. cap. 20. Simoni Deo sancto / To Simon the holly God / as Eusebius / Theodoret / ād other do also testifie / And moreouer yf it be trew that Martiō the heritique prea∣ched at Rome in the time of Policarpus Busshop of Smirna 160. yeare after Christe as Ieraenus witnesseth / Irenaeus li. 3. cap. 3. And also that Cerdo the heritique came to Rome in the tyme of Higinius 144 yeare after Christe as Euse∣bius witnesseth libro quarto Cap. 8Eusebius lib. iiij. cap. vlij. Item that Nouatus the Anabap∣tiste taught in Rome in the time of Pope Fabianus 255. yeare after Christe. Item that Pope Liberius was an Arian in the tyme of Constantyne and preached in Rome as Platina witnesseth / Pope Liberius was an hereti∣que. Platina. Yf (I saye) all these thynges bee trewe (as they be of these olde and credible au∣thoures reported) then must this be Ano∣ther of Martins lies / for Iouiniā was 400 years after Christe & lōge after these heri¦tiques whome I haue aleaged as by the yeares doeth plainely appeare. All these were before Iouinian / & heritiques / and at Rome / & preached or taught ther. Ergo Ioinian was not the furst. But if Mar¦tin wold excuse himself by that which he
addeth (as he saieth) out of Saint Hie∣rom / as he pretendeth / and as by the no∣te in the margent it should seem that h wold / That Iouinian the mōke was the first heretique that preached in Rome / that there was no differēce betwixt uir∣ginitie & matrimonie: Yet can not Martin so saue himself otherwise thē one who for defending of his legges toke a blow vpon the face. For I assuer the good re∣ader this is as great a lye as the other / Yt is a lye I say that this saying whiche Martin both by the text and note in the margent ascrybeth to be sayd by Saint Hierom in the furst and second epistle vn¦to Iouinian / Martin falseli belieth Saint Hierom. for it is in neither of them both / but is a matter of Martyns own forginge & framinge / Though the thing it self be of no great importance / yet is it not vnneedfull to shew how shamefully / these Papists belye the ould authors. Martin yet can not thus be contentid but procedeth from one lye to annother. Saying that The new superindēts (me¦aning the godli preachers in bleszid king Edward the vj his daies) taught all one doctrine with Iouinian.Another lye of Marns. Which was as Martin alledged out of Saint Hierom.
ast seldom but marry often for ye cā not onsummate the works of matrimony on es ye eat and drink delicatly. Thow shalt ote good reader / in this allegaciō Mar¦īs ignoraūce / for he taketh these words  spoken by Iouinian / when in deed hey are but fayned of Saint Hierom & ronice obiectid to Iouinian / Martyn is de∣ceaued by a pa∣ralogisme of S. Hierom. lib. ij. aduersus Iouinianū in fine. as althou∣ghe this was not by him taught in play∣e words / yet that it was agreable to his octrine. But Martin taketh it as hough it had beē Iouiniās own words. Note also that S. Hierom in this place peaketh not of the mariadge of preests ut of secōd mariadges generally / obiec∣ting to Iouinian as a licentius & an vn∣godly doctrīe to teach the peple that they might vse second & often mariadge.Sant Hierom was notid of his frinds as an enemy of se∣cond mariad∣ges / and ma∣keth an excuse for his so doin∣ge. And this opinion of Saint Hierom was no∣tid by his frinds / wherof after aduertise∣ment he pourged himself in his Apolo∣gie made for the same purpose. But let vs graunt that these words were not fay¦ned by Saint Hierom. I pray the Mar¦tynn / how canst thow be hable to iustifie that this was the Doctrine of the preach¦ers in England / whom contemptuosly thow callest (superintēdents?) Our who¦le doctrine wherin we consentid touchin∣ge

But yf thow cāst not fynde this dotrine / whiche thow saiest was Iouinian in those books / then may we boldly sa that thow doest falsly belye vs. Our doctrine was not kept so secret / but that i was not only preached / but also printid & so printid that it hath the testimony of th whole realme. And is safly enoghe pre∣serued out of the hands of the proudest o yow. Wherfor neither thow Martin / no no mā ells cā misreporte vs touching our doctrine but they shall haue both these books the acts of parliament / the subscrip∣tions of the clergie / yea and your own subscriptions / and the testimonies of the whole realme against thē.

The fift Chapter. Of the good name superintendent / and of the names of ministers deuisid by the Po¦pe and his adherents / with the somme of Martins reason conteyned in his first chapter. ANd further wheras it pleasith mar¦tyn not only in this place but also herafter to gest at the name of Su¦perintendent / That Martin maliciosly gest¦eth at the good name of super∣intendent. he sheweth himself bent to condempne all things that be good / tho∣ughe in so doinge he can not avoyde his open shame. Who knoweth not that the name Busshop hath so been abusid / that when it was spoken the peple vnder¦stode
nothinge els but a great lord / tha went in a whyte rochet / with a wyde shauen crown / and that carieth an oyle box with him / wherwith he vseth ōce in seauen yeres rydinge about to confirme chidren / etc. Now to bringe the peple fro this abuse / what better means cā be de∣uisid / then to teach the peple ther error by another word out of the scriptures / of the same signification? which thing by the terme (superintendēt) wold in tyme haue been well brought to passe. For the or∣dinary paynes of suche as were called su∣perintendents / shuld haue taught the pe∣ple to vnderstand the dewtie of there bus∣hop / which you Papists wold fayne haue hidden from them. And the word (su¦perintēdent) being a very latin word ma¦de English by vse / should in tyme haue ta¦ught the peple by the very etymologie & and proper significatiō / what thīge was ment when they hard that name / which by this terme Bushop / could not so well be donne / by reason that bushops in the time of Popery were ouerseers in name / but not in deed. So that there doinge could not teache the peple there names / neither what they shuld loke for at there bushops hāds. For the name bushop / spo¦ken
amongest the vnlerned / signified to em nothinge lesze then a preacher of Gods word / because there was not / nor  any thinge more rare in any order of cclesiasticall parsons / then to see a busz∣op preache: Wherof the doīgs of the po¦ishe buszhops of England can this day itnes / but the name (superintendent) hould make him ashamed of his negli∣ence / and a frayd of his ydelnes / know∣ng that Saint Paule doth call apon him o attēd to himself & to his whole flock / Act. xx. Of the which sentēce our bushops mark he first peece right well (that is) to take ede to them selues / but they be so deafe hat they can not herkē to the second (that s) to look to there flock: I denie not but hat the name (busshop) may be well ta∣ē / but because the euelnes of the abuse / hath marrid the goodnes of the word it can not be denied but that it was not a∣misse to ioyne for a tyme another word with it in his place / wherby to restore hat abusid word to his right significati¦on. And the name (superintēdēt) is such a name that the Papists themselues (sau∣inge such as lack both lerninge & wit) can not fynde falt withall.The Papist Peresius parte tertia aloweth the terme of su∣perintendent. For Peresi∣us the spaniard / & an Archepapist / (ou
of whom Martin hath stolē a great part of his boke) speaking of a buszhop saieth Primum Episcopi munus nomē ipsum praese fert, quod est superintendere: Episcopus enim superintendens interpretatur, uisitans aut superuidens that is to say. The chefe office of a bushop by interpretatiō / signifieth a Superin∣tendent / Martyn hath stolen common places out of Peresius the spanish Papist a Visitor or an Ouerseer. Why did not Martyn aswell steale this peece outof Peresius as he did steale all the cōmon places that he hath for the profe of the Cannons of the Apostels / and of Tra¦ditions in his second and third chapters? And also the most parte of all the authori¦ties that be there patched together / and most fasly and vnlernedly wrythed / from gods treuth out of the generall counsels and old wryters through out his booke. None be more blynde then they whose ey∣es be put out with malice.Martin in the lxxxiij. leaf of his booke. Martyn in the 88 leafe is not ashamed in his booke to deuide the significatiōs of the termes (busshop) & (superintendent) as thoughe the one were not signified by the other. But it may be that Martyn ād the rest of the popishe sect / wold not haue the na∣me of (Superintendent) or Minister vsid / lest that name whiche did put the peple in re∣membraunce of sacrificīge and bludsup∣pinge
should be forgotten.The Papists do studie to dri∣ue men from knowledge to ig¦noraunce. Blyndnes  ignoraunce is the rediest way to brin∣e the heresie of the Papists into estima∣on. wherfore when the peple is most lynde / thē shall these heretiques be most stemed. We Christiās vse no words nor earmes commonly in setting furth the cclesiasticall ord of prayers or in the mi∣istration of the holy Sacraments / or in aming the ministers therof / or of any o∣her thinge therunto belonginge / onles we haue some ground of scripture aswell for the name / as for the thinge. yet that not withstandinge / the reader may see we can not auoyd the bytīge of ther malicio∣se mouthes. But I pray the good read oke againe on the other syde / what a nō∣er of things and names they haue deui∣sed / & daily do deuise / without any groūd either of God or of good men.The Papists find fault with the names diui∣sid by the holy gost. The papists ha¦ue no scripture for the defence of the names of there own sha∣uelings. Oh how the Papists wold triumph ouer vs / ifthei had like profe for the names & things of there diuisinge / for the names (I say) of Pope / Cardinal / legat / suffragan / Cannō Prebendary / Monke / Non̄e / Heremet / Anchor / Chanon / ffryer / and all the rest of the vyprose generation and ofspringe of the Pope / as we that professe Christ / ha¦ue for the maintaince of the termes and
names of (Superintendent) minister Seniors / Elders / Brethren / & suche lik by vs vsid? But this help of the scripture not withstandinge they lak / yet is no Martin & his felowes ashamed to char∣ge our names / which begā with the new Testament / with the reproche of newnes / geuinge to the names of there own deui∣singe / the prayse of old Antiquitie / tho∣ughe suche names were not knowen to the church of Christ / many hundreth ye∣res after Christs ascension. Wherfore thow mayst see good reader / that they a∣buse thyne eares whē they say there doc∣trine is the elder / empeachinge our doc∣trine with the reproche of newnes. And therwith thow mayst also perceaue / that this is one of there sleyghts wherby to begg of the / our discredit and there owne estimation. With whiche inconuenien∣ce I thought good to meet in the begin∣ninge / because Martins rayling pen is euer busy with this practise. Now to pro¦cede / I will reherse Martyn / whyles he wandreth stryuinge to proue by sundry places of Doctors patched together wit¦hout either ground / or good order: that heresy / and lechory be cōmonly ioyned to∣gether. Wherin I wold not greatly ha∣ue
stand with him yf he wold haue delt plainely / trewly / and syncerely. But he hath cast suche a mist before the eyes of the reader with cryēg out (heresy lechory thefe and traytor) that no man lyuinge wold iudge any man of so impudent o pirite / thus shamelesly to abuse suche a∣iose names against the giltles / when he & his felowes (the treuthe beinge kno∣wen) be of all men lyuinge most faultye n those vyces. Neuertheles when I con¦ider the prophecies spokē before / of this wicked generatiō I cease maruaylinge & perceaue well that they must needs be of that sort and nomber whom the scryp∣ure nameth painted sepulchres / the com¦any of syn̄ers / The churche malignant / The Synagoge of Sathan / The right na∣mes of the Pa∣pistes. Trees with ut frute dumm dogges / deaf Serpents (as the scripture reporteth / of suche) wol¦es / Beares / Lyōs / Add's frye / false pro¦hets / false Apostles / infideles / wearers of whores faces / The companiōs of the es / Murtherers of the Saints of God he enemies of the Crosse of Christe / the ompany of dissemblers / and the churche f hypocrytes etc. These names I know Martin and his felowes will refuse / be ause they loue nothinge worse then the
trew confession whiche is the testimony of right repentance. And because all these names may well be includid vnder the name of (Heretique) wherwith am∣ongst other Martyn so often / and so hor∣riblye barketh against us: I haue tho∣ught good before I procede further / to io¦ine with Martyn and all the rest of his sect for tryall wheather of vs be most worthy of the name (heretique.) And in conclusion / when it shall appeare by play¦ne demōstratiō whether of vs both is the heretique in deed / let then him haue lecho¦ry / & theft / and Treason / and what other vyce ye will an̄exid vnto him in the name of God. For I am contentid also to graūt to Martyn to help him forward that vy∣ces be lyncked / and coupled as vertewes together.I. 2. For Saint Iames saieth he that offendeth in one / offendeth in all / for so muche as he becom̄eth gylty of all. Wherby thow mayst see good read / that Martyn nedeth not to haue stand long a¦bout the profe of this point .i. (that here∣sie & lechory be cōmonly ioyned to gether) for it is prouid by S. Iames / that vyces hange of suche sort together that whoso
fendeth in one mai be charged with all e other: Therfor should Martyn ha∣ left of this vnnecessary labor / if he min¦ to touche maried priests / and should ther haue trauayled in the profe of his inor / that is to say that maried priest  heretiques / And that those two vyces resy and lechory meet together in all aried priests. But this thing Mar∣ hath left vndone / by means wherof s cauillatiō is discouerid / Yea and it is rteine that many olde heriques lyuide astly touchinge the body. Yet that this inge may more euidently appeare vn∣the / I will sett brefly before thine eies e whole som̄e of this reason / which he tendeth at large / but hydeth notwith∣dinge from thee / the minor or mean pro¦sitiō: because he can not proue it / Thus  reasoneth.Martins reason. Martin fai∣letht in the profe of this minor. Heresy and lechory becom  only ioyned together: but all maried iests be heretiques / ergo they be lech∣s or cōtrary they be lechors / ergo / they  hereiques. This is his very reason sence. Now let it be grauntid / that resy and lechory be commonly ioyned gether / yet if he wold by means of
there coniunctiō charge the maried  with the one (that is to say) with  / then must he by demonstration  them gylty of the other / that is to  of heresy / or els this reason conclud nothinge. And this demōstration sho be the profe of his Minor / whiche in this discourse is no whit prouid. Yt  be that you wold couer the folishnes  your reason with the term (common but that term (as you haue placid it)  you to no purpose / onles it signi (allway). For in the tytell of your  chapter you say that Heresy & lechory  the ōli causes of priests mariadges whrupon it should folow (if you had prou it) that all maried priests / not only comonly be / but all be / lechors and heretques / or els would they neauer marr which generall / being by one particul improuid / as it is plainly by the marige of the Apostels / etc▪ your term (comonly can serue to no purpose / but  the profe of a common lye / for your dfense. And further your term (comōly) not taken for (all) maketh your rason to be from a particular to a geneall / Vinuersaliter ād so vsinge a subteltie
histry calllid fallatia consequentis ye play  plaine bablinge Sophister / The logique of the Papistes standeth in fal∣lacious. whiche  must be your reward for your wyse . And on the other syde if ye vse  terme (commonly) for allwaies then  your ground be / that heresy and  be alwaies ioined together / wher¦n it should folow that all whores / ād remongers be heretiques / but that  not be / for ye know wel enough that  of your virgin preests may be / Incōueniences that shoulde fo∣lowe if all le∣chors were here¦tiques. & ith you / both Sodomittes / ād who ngers / and yet as long as they ma∣ot / be no heretiques but Catholique  and good virgin priests still / as  & virgins goe in the Popes . And it were a great inconueni∣ that the pope and dyuers busshops  kepe boyes for filthīes against kyn¦nd that dyuers of the chefe Doctors ngland and other should for lechory llid either heretiques / or no virgīs· nd it should folow also (amongest a  nomber of other whome I both cā will name / D.

A discourse wherin is plainly prouid scriptures and aunceant doctors tha Papists be heretiques / and also a corison made between the opinions of  Papists and the opiniōs of half a hdrth of the most aunceant and horible heretiques that euer were in the church of God. A discourse pro¦uinge that all Papists be here¦ques.NOw to returne to my former ppose. Forasmuch as you haue  that heresie and lechory be cmonly ioyned together / I am conten reason with Martin for the tryall  name of (hereti{que}) wheather of vs is worthie so to be callid / for to him by tins own confession lechory is most cmonly annexid. In this discourse  conuenient to serch what heresie is / how it is definid. And in this poi wil folow the iudgement of the most  and vnsuspecid wryters for paalitie.
which way if thow Martyn hadest folowed in thy booke / thow shouldest not haue had much matter to babell with all Tertullian in his booke de praescriptioni∣bus aduersus haereticos saieth that the greek word  signifieth a chosing / Tertullian de∣perscriptiōibus. aduersus hereti¦cos. & that of that word be heritiques named. Because they chose out ād take vpon them the de∣fense of certein doctrins contrary to gods word..The  of heresy. The causes whiche moue thē thus to doe / be either that they be willfully ig∣noraunt / and will not know the scriptu∣res / or if they know them they regard thē not / or els couetousnes / and wordly com∣modytie / mouith them to inuent such fan¦tasies. And for confirmation of this / Aug. in the begin̄ing of his boke de vtilitate credendi. An heretique is definid. S. Austen in the begin̄inge of his book De utilitate credendi / Against the Manichaeis / maketh this definition of an heretique. Haereticus est qui alicuius temporalis commodi & maxime gloriae, principatus{que} causa, falsas ac no uas opiniones gignit & sequitur. An heretique is he who beginneth and foloweth false and new opinions / a∣pon hope of wordly commoditie / and to thintēt to be in glorie & authoritie / And this formor definition of Sainte Austen maye bee gathered out of Irenaeus in his 3. boo Cap. 3 Aduersus Valentinum.
and out of S. Ciprian in his bok de simplcitate praelatorum and Gratian also aloweth  out of S. Austen amongest the popes decrees .24. p. 3:Irenaeus.Cyprianus.24. q. 3. Her. Her: All these old fathers / and all other of name and antiquitie / approue and alow this definitiō of an heretique.The difinition of heresie. So that I may boldly pronounce the definition of Heresie to be this: He∣resie is a choyse and a stubborn and fro∣ward defense / of certaine opinions and doctrines whiche be cōtrary to gods wor¦de / either by reason of ignoraunce / or of contempt of the same word / therby to at¦teyn either to lucre / or to estimation. The materiall parte of this definition is the opinions and doctrines cōtrary to Gods word. The formall cause / the choyse and stubborn defense / the efficiēt cause / wher by they be mouid and led to be ignorant / and the contempt of Gods holy word / & a froward will:The Papistes take vpon them the defense of iustification by wores contra∣rie to gods wor¦de and agre the re with Pela∣gis the hereti∣que. The finall cause or the end / is the intent to attaine to honor plea¦sure and wordly riches: Nothinge is there more to be desyred for the perfectiō of this definition. Now then forth with to ioyne with the Martyn / & all the Pa∣pists for plaine profe by this definition that ye be all hereiques. Haue not you Papists taken apō you the defense of the
octrine of iustification by mans works alowing and folowinge the pestilent he¦retique Pellagius / directly cōtrary to the doctrine of Gods holy word / and aga∣ine all the old lerned fathers and Doct∣ors in the churche of Christe? Yf ye wold obstinatly say it is not against the scrip∣tures / doth not Saint Paule plainly con¦dempne you saing. We think that man is iustified by faith / without the works / of the law?Rom. 2.

They haue also taken apon them to defend that there is a place whe¦re paynes euerlasting be turned into tem¦porall / and they haue named that place (without scripture / and of ther oun head
Purgatorie and they say they haue authori¦tie & power / to diminishe the same pain¦es / by their diriges and Masses / which they sell for mony / and by that mean / like craftie theues / pye the pourses of the pe¦ple. Do they not defend this doctrine / and deuelishe opiniō with fyer / and rope against the manifest word of god? which not only maketh no mention of any such  third place / but also sayeth to the thefe / Lu. 3. Lu. 7. Phi. 1. Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso, This day shalt thow be with me in Paradise? And thy  faith hath made the whole goe in peace. And Saint Paule shewing the cause why he desyred to be out of this lif / was  that he might, esse cū Christo, be with Chri∣ste / neither fearing nor mencioninge any  stai by the wai as the popishe heretiques each in purgatorie.In the old Te∣stament ther was neauer sa∣crifice offerid for the dead. And this is nota∣ble / in the old Testament / that sacrifices were offered for all sortes of peple / for kings / for preests / for lepers / etc. But ye shall neuer read that any sacrifice was offered for the dead / shall we think that so long tyme God wold forget the dead? that he wold so lōge suffer them to lye in the fier of purgatorie? The pope ye say can delyuer whom he will out of that pri¦son: Yf it be trew / is he not a tyrant

He did it belik because he thinketh the Pope may erre / cōtrary to the doctrine of the Papistes.The Papists ae apon them the defense of sa∣ing the common praies in a tong not vnderstan∣did of the peple contrarie to gods word. Moreouer / haue not the Papists taken apon them the defense of this opinion that all things red in the churche ought to be in the Latin tonge? that is to say / in a tong not vnderstandid of the peple / directly agaīst Gods word? Read the XIIII. Chapter of the first epistle of Saint Paule to the Corinthiās and there shall ye see / how māifestly this doctrine is against God.. Cor. 14. Saint Paule  there sayeth / yf I shall cumme tu you / ād speak in a tonge that you vnderstād not what shall it profet yow? Doe not the popishe heretiques say / Reasone to proue that pray¦er in the church ought to be in the vulgar tōge cleane contrary to him / that both they can and doe proffit speaking in a language not vnderstan∣did? S Paul saith / Si orē lingua spiritus meus orat,
mens mea fructu uacat: Yf I pray in a tōg not vnderstandid) my spirit prayeth but  mind or vnderstanding hath no profit erby: doe not they say the clean contra∣ that my soule hath profet ther by? S. aul wold haue him that standeth by vn∣erstand what is spoken / that he might aye Amen to thy thanks geuinge: Doe ot the Papists kepe the stander by from he vnderstanding of that is sayd / so that e can not say Amen to thy thanks geuin∣e / with vnderstandinge / as the Apostle eaneth? Words spokē & not vnderstan¦yd  / be lyke to a talk in the wynde to no urpose sayth Saint Paule:Saint Paule doctrine and the Papists▪ be contrary. that is not so ay the Papists. Saint Paule woulde ra¦her haue fyue words spoken in the chur¦he wherby the peple may haue some pro¦et / thē ten thousand in a tong not vnder¦tandid  / doe not the Papists hold quyte cō¦rary / that it is better to haue ten thou¦and words spoken in the churche / not vn¦erstandid of the peple then fyue spoken hiche may be vnderstandid? S. Pau∣e  saieth he that speaketh (lingua) meanin∣e in a tonge not vnderstandid / let him old his peace / onlesthere be summe in∣erpretor / to shew what is ment.
And do not the Papists bable ther mattēs masse & Euensong in Latin / without an interpretor / so that the peple bing ignorant in the tong / can take no prfet therby? Thus ye see that for the mos parte (whatsoeuer Gods word sayeth this sect of the Papists maintaine wit toth and nayle the cleane contrary. And thinke you this last / is of simple ignor∣aunce / and so but an error in them? na some of themselues haue cōfessed the truth with Saint Paule in open pulpit ād otherwise / The Papistes take vpon them to defende / that the laye people ought not to re∣ceaue the sacra∣mēte of the blud of Christe. that it wer better to haue praers in an vnderstandid language / which now yet doe (as al the world may see) le∣aue god & serue the tyme / but to procede▪ Lykewise haue they chosen an opiniō to defend that the lay peple ought not to drink of the Sacrament of the blud of our lord Iesus Christ / Math. xxvj.

But as for womē the Papists be lyke thing they haue no soules. For who hath not herd that westō was not ashamed in open disputatiō against the bliszid martyr of god master Latimer in Oxford / to maintayn

And that for declaration and profe of the same heretical opinion / am∣ongst other questions / he was not asha∣med / to demande of the sayd holy martyr where he foūd ī the scriptures that womē ought to receaue the Sacrament? Vnto whome Master latymer answerd: Yes & it please your mastership I shall fynde it in the scriptures that women ought to re¦ceaue the Sacrament: Nay quod westō that can ye not fynde in the scriptures. yes quod Latimer here I haue it (I trow) in Saint Paule.1.

Of a like sort Weston declarid with no lesse boldnes his ignorāce at Paules crosse in the her∣ing of the whole audience sayinge that the greek word  signifieth hominum deuoratores /D.

What is this els but a plain remouin¦ge and putting away of all maried men and women from the communion out of the Churche of God.By the testimo¦ny of old doct∣ors / The Pa∣pists agree with most of the old heretiques in iudging mariad¦ge to be an vn∣clean thinge. In this point be∣fore rehersed the Papists agree with all the most old ād aunceant heretiques that blew this first poyson in to the churche of God. As yf thow wilt read S. Austen de haeresi., Irenaeus contra Valenti. Clemens, Alexan.  Theodoret.
Epiphanius Eusebius, thow shalt well pereca¦ne that these heretiques which I will now reherse were of the self same opini∣on. Basilides Carpocrates and Saturninus,Old heretiques 137 af¦ter Christ / The Marcionistes, The Tatianistes, and all the sect which of abstinence callid them selues Encratitae 160 and 180. yeres af∣ter Christ. The Manichaeis 280. yeres af∣ter Christ / The Aerians and Priscillianistes,The Papists consent to the old Heretiques that wold not receaue the com¦muniō with ma¦ried folk because they thought thē vnclean as the Papists iudge maried Priests only because they be maried. in spayn. And the heretiques named / Hierachits, Apostolici, Valesij, Adamiani, Abellio∣nij, Ampotactitae, Eutichiani, Heracleonitae & a nō¦ber more / all agree with the Papists in this point (that the vse of matrimony is vncleanes) and therfor wold they not re∣ceaue the communion with such as were maried. But all this holy pretense / Was but an outward shew / wherwith to blyn¦de the eyes of the peple / as S. Austen speaketh of the Manicheis saying. Nec ferre possum Manichaeorum iactantiam,Retract lib. 1. cap. 7. de falsa, & fallaci Continentia, uel Abstinentia, quase ad imperitos decipiendos, ueris Christianis, quibus comparandi non sunt, insuper praeferunt. I can not abyde / (sayth Saint Au∣sten) the bragging and boasting of these Heretiques the Manicheis, for there false and deceytfull Continency / and Ab∣stinence
from mariadge / wherwith they auaunce themselues aboue godly Christi¦an men with whom they are not to becō∣parid. Haue not our popishe heretiques put vpon them this glittering shew and whorishe face / of the Manicheicall & such like hereticall chastitie? Who seeth not that they be altogether counterfetters / dissemblers / hypocrites / maskers / lyers / raylers / whoremōgers / sodomites / swea¦rers / blasphemers / bludsuppers / Idola∣ters / Tyrāts / Extorsiōers? who seeth not that they be proud vnder the color of hu∣militie? Enuiose vnd the face of pacience / slougthfull / pretending study? Maliciose in fayninge frendship / couetous / cōterfet∣tinge liberalitie? Very Epicures and ten¦duble gluttōs vnder the shadow of hous∣keping? and stinking bawdy lechors / vn∣der the cloke of wieles lyfe / or (as they name it) of maydenhead / and virginitie? No trenth / honestie nor godlines / but vn¦der ther long gounes / shauen crounes / & syde typets / dōghils of all kynde of other durty vyces ioyned with there lecherose lyfe and hereticall opinions / Martins own words in the lxxxviij. leaf of his book. as Martin himself witnesseth that they commonly goe together. And as for second mari∣adges Martynn vtterly condempneth
for vnhonest / saying amongst other argu¦ments in the 88. leafe of his book in this wyse. Yea and this one thing I will further say / that in lay men to / it was tho¦ught more lawfull then honest etc. And in this poynt Martin agreeth with the old heretiques Mōtanus,Martin agre∣eth with those he¦retiques that hold that second mariadges we∣re vncleare. Maximil∣la, Priscilla, Cataphryges, and Cathari (170 yeres after Christ) with Proculus and dyuerse o∣ther who were infectid with the same he∣resy. Thus mayst thow see good rea∣der / that not only the very definitiō of an heretique hath disclosid the papists to be heretiques / but also the defense of the self same opinions wherof the old heretiques were comdempned / doth confirm my dis∣course apō the definition to be soūd good and trew. Now if it shall please Mar∣tyn to let lechory be also annexid to the pa¦pists that she may kepe heresie company he may / or els let him desier that it may be scraped out of his book lest the reader fyndīg him faultie in the one / shall iudge him giltie in the other. This profe may seem sufficient to all such as will with re∣ason be satisfied / but I am not ignorant of the wrangling and Sophisticall wit∣tes of the Papists / wherfor although my sayd former profe by definition of an he∣retique
/ hath made euident demonstrati∣on that all papists be heretiques / yet that the same may somwhat more largelie appere / I haue thought good to ioyn the o∣pinions of the Papists and of the mst aunceant deuelishe and horrible hereti∣ques together / That the doctri¦e of the Pa∣pists is made of old heresies. wherby the reader shall well perceaue / that there is no opinion allmost so wicked amōgst the other sects of heretiques already for heretiques codempned / but for the most part the Pa∣pists haue thesame / or els in stead thero another very like vnto it / which is as e∣uell or worse.The ordinary glose apon the xvij. of Luk. And because Martī in his second leaf chargeth vs with the life of Si∣mon Magus the first & arch heretique tha euer was after Christs tyme (and the or∣dinary glose apō the 17 of luk. saieth that Antichrist shall be the last) I will first cō¦pare his life and doings with the pope the same antichrist the head of the popish sect and al that folow the popish heresie.Euseb.

Who is it that hath blīdid the wor¦ld this thousand yere / with witchecraft / with wonders and false miracles? is it not the pope and you Papists? who is it that hath bought and sold / and daylie do make marchandise of the gyftes of the ho¦ty gost / of the Sacramēts / & other thing∣es that ye call holy / Aug. de haresi∣bus.

Irenaeus also witnesseth that both Bassilides, Carpocrates, and Gnostici whiche were about 130 yere after Christ set furth ymages of Christ to be worship¦ped. His words be these.

And shortly after Saint Austē lar¦gely declareth by cōparison the scrupulose abstinēce of the Manichaeis from flesh with the sober dyet of the trew Christian man. And now I most hartelie desier the gē∣ell read to cōsider how S. Austē painteth out / & most manifestly descrybeth the fast of the Manicheis to be such a fast / as is now a dayes / the fast of our Papists (that is to say) gluttony / & not a meās to tame the flesh as they do pretēd.Saincte Au∣stens wordes. Aug. de mori∣bus Ecclesiae cath. et Mani. lib. 2. cap. 3 And that the sober dyet of the Christiā man catīg spa∣rely of flesh is the right kynde of fastīg. Thus S. Austen reasoneth. Yf there be a mā (as it is possible (so spare of dyet & pro¦fitable

And also that the same man drink of the water / wherwith the husks of grapes be washed after the presz¦ing / and of sider and suche other liquors / which though they be no wyne / yet they serue in stead of wyne / yea and passe it al∣so in swetnes. And be it that this man drink not only so much as he thursteth / but so much as him lusteth: And that he hath a dayly prouision for this dyet / and hath plēty of these delicates / wherwith to
serue not only his necessitie / but also his lust: Wheather of these twayn / iudge you as touchīg meat & drink / to lyue in more abstinence? I think (sayth Saint Austē) ye be not so blynde but that yow will pre∣fer the man which lyueth with the litel baken and wyne:Note vow Pa¦pists your super¦stitiosnes in ab∣stinence from fleshe to the other glutton: for the trueth it self dryueth you to this ans∣wer. But yow heretiques be of the con∣trary opinion (saieth he) for by your opi∣nion / if this second man shuld supp with the first but one night / ād should but tou¦che his lippes / and smell of his bakē tho∣ugh it were resty / Aug.

Thus far out of S, Austen / which saying he fur¦ther also foloweth to the same effect. And likewise in the opinion of the mariadge / of priests / the Manichaeis and the Papists haue like agreement / for they suffrid so many of thē as were callid (auditores) to eat flesh / and to marry at there pleasure / and to till the ground / etc. as S.

But the∣re Ministers whō they callid Electos they wold in no wyse suffer to marry / nor to til the groūd / etc. Here seest thow good rea¦der the ful agreement of the heresy of the Manicheis and of the heresie of the Pa¦pists
touching mariadge of prests▪ And that the doctrine of vs (whom Martin & such other heretiques call heretiques) a∣greeth with the doctrine of the Catholi∣que church by the iudgement of S. Austē & that the doctrine of the Papists in this poynt agreeth with the Heretiques the Manicheis. And forasmuch as both he and Irenaeus, Epiphanius,The furst that commaundid fa¦sting by a law was an hereti∣que Eusebi. lib. 5. cap. 18. Theodoretus and o∣ther doe note the like opinion of abstinen¦ce from flesh in Tatian and his folowers who were callid : And in Monta¦no the heretique who was the first that euer made lawes for fastinge / And in the heretiques named Aeriani Bassilidiani Priscil anistae and Saturninus / and diuerse other Arch heretiques / whiche were also enemi¦es to mariadge: Why may not I be as bold to note this for an heresie in the Pa∣pistes / as these and other old / holy / aunce¦ant / lerned and approued fathers & Doc¦tors of the church of God / were neither af¦raied nor ashamed to note these old / As the Mani¦cheis requirid there bt named Epis▪ funda∣menti to be cre∣detid.

Sozo menus li.vj.ca.xxvj. Brefenes that I study for will not suffer me to compare / the Eunomiās with the Papists in so many things as I might / but this one thing I may not passe ouer. They persuaded there dis∣ciples that no sin̄ should hurt them / that  were partakers of ther misteries: And do not the Papists say that he shall not be dampned that is buried in S.

The secte of heretiques that were callid Euchtae or Psalliani of whom E∣piphanius maketh mention contra Massili∣os,Euchitae. and Saint Austen de haeresibus who for mumbling vp of ther long prayers were callid the praing heretiques (for so soun∣deth the Greek word ) they wold nea¦uer cease praying ād singing of Psalmes day and night. And so much they gaue them selues to prayer that they thought themselues bound to doe nothing ells: Not to gett there liuing with the sweat of there browes / Not to truble themsel∣ues with any office that concerned the commōwelh / Not to study or to put ther hand to any kynd of labor: But to lyue in continuall ydelnes / in only eating / drin∣king / sleapīg / and praying.

Austen de heresibus. Yet this one thing I can not omit which S. Austen and other do note of the Priscillia¦nistes the spanishe heretiques. This say∣ing (saith he) is alowed & commendid a∣mongst them:Priscillianistes the spanishe he∣retiques. Iura periura secretum prodere noli: swere and forswere and vtter no se∣crets. Oh how wel this rule is obserued of the Papists. This is such a maxime a∣mōgst them / that almost all there fetches and practises against Christ / be compas∣sed with periury.Perimy am∣ongst the Pa∣pists is lawful- I wold faine learn an answer to this question / how many Pa∣pists be there this day in England / being
born in Englād that were not either tra¦yters to there prince king Hēry the VIII. or els periurid apō the holy Euangelists? Our Doctrine whiche is taught by the scriptures of God & was confirmed with the sheding of Christs blud apon the Cros¦se / is blasphemosly reportid by Martī & his fellowes / in the last end of the first Chap. of his book to haue his begin̄ing of lechory / and to end in Sedicion and tre¦ason / which saying is so maliciose / that it wold styrre any trew and earnest fauorer eyther of Gods word / or of the realme / if it had not been vtterid by the pen af a per¦iurid traytor: what man can be dū / whan he seeth trew men falsly accusid / of here∣sie / sedition and treason / by a boke set out in prynt? Yea by a book dedicatid to the Queen herself? But wryte on and spare not / God be praised we haue not only spū¦ges to put out that ye wryte / but we ha∣ue also pencils to paynt yow in your co∣lors: and be yow well asuerid the world shall see (God willing) ye haue made a smoke wherwith to put out your own ey∣es.Of the genealo¦gie of the po∣pish heresy. The Genealogy of popry is not vn∣knowen to the world / & that it might the better be knowē / I turned a tragedy into the Englishe tōge which was first writtē
by the excellēt learned father Bernhardinus Ochinus Senensis & did cause it to be prīted / where it is shewed by a cōtinual discour∣se / euē frō the begin̄inge how the popes authoritie first began with flattery / fflattey Ignor¦aunce Super∣stition lyeng ād Sufferance ha¦ue made the po∣pe a God. and waxed stronge by ignoraunce / and super¦stitiō of Princes / and how in tyme suffer¦ance / made the popes Traytors / wherby they toke vpon them suche boldnes that being before but the Emperors chaplens they challendgid to be the Emperors ma¦sters. In so much that Hildebrand a pope of Rome and first a monk / Gregorie the .vij. pope of Ro¦me made the Empereour stād  forte iij. dayes in fost and snow with∣out dore A. god lesson for the clergy how they shall kepe lay mens neks vnder ther gye∣dell· otherwise nam∣ed Gregorius .7. was neither ashamed nor afraid to force Henry the fourth (than be¦ing Emperor) to stand 3 dayes / barfote / in the frosty tyme of winter / without do∣re / and wold not suffer the Emperor / to be admitted to his presence. This treason of the popes was allway vpholdid and de¦fendid / by periure / hypocrisie / idolatrie / & a continuall forge of lyeng / all which ab∣hominations / being once entrid into the church of Rome / haue not seuerid thēsel∣ues from the beginnīg / but kepe toge∣ther / not ōly in the pope / but in al papists to this day. And for a more large pro∣fe of the cōtinuāce of periury emong the Papists / if it may please you to read a pe¦ce
of there doings / in the popish generall counsell at Constance / ye shall affirme my saying to be trueth.Ihn Hus and Hierm of Pra¦ga were  sid y the coun∣sell to cum afe and go efe / and yet were they cntra to the fath / tan and burned. Yt may please yow to vnderstand / that the worthy Martyrs of Iesus Christ Ioan.

But when the papists had once ca¦ught thē / they brak promes with them / and wold not suffer thē to departe / but li∣ke false murderers burned thē / Lo there is (periura) forswere. Yet lest they shuld se¦em to do any thing wherin all there sect did not consent (establishing this practi∣se of the Priscillianistes) they made this Antichristian law / in the 19 seszion.Concilium Cō∣stantiense sesi∣one xix.

The English wherof is this.

By this wicked decree of of Generall Counsell thow maist aswel see / the error of a generall coūsell / as the
error of the Priscilliāists (though not by expresse name / The practise of this popish gen¦eral councell ād the doctrin of the Priscilliani¦ss agree. A generall coū¦sell doth erre. Iouinian and the Papists cō∣parid together. yet in deed) confirmed am¦ongst the Papists / which by Saint Austen Ir¦ene Epiphanius. Theodoret. &c. is in these heretiques most worthily condempned. Saint Hierom. calleth Iouinian the Epicure of the Christians. Whom he so iudgeth because of his wordly pleasures / and vo∣luptuose lyfe. But was there euer such vo¦luptuose swynes as the pope and his cre¦atures be? loke apon there fare / there ap∣parell / ther houses / their moyles / there whores / there boyes / there traynes of ruffiās / ther dailie cardīg / dising / swerīg facing / pouling / theuing / & such lyke ab∣hominations / continewed and maintain¦ed in there houses. Cōsider the daylie pro¦uisiōs / made to mayntayne there glutton¦ny / to cōtinew there pryde / to enlarge the¦re pleasures: and Iouinian shalbe coun∣ted but a counterfect epicure to the most parte of these lordly creatures of the po∣pes generation.These opinions of the Eustachi¦ans be To. con. gen. 1. p. 287. Neither Epicurus / nor Ari¦stippus / nor Sardanapalus / neuer sought moe means / for belly far / and wordly pleasu∣res thē haue these holy fathers / The agrement of the Papists with the hereti∣ques named Eustachiani. who vnd the color of (holy) ād (ffather) fill Christē∣dō ful of the wiked children of the deuel. We read also of a certin sect of Hereti∣ques
who were callid of some Eustathians / and of other Som Eustachians in the ty∣me of the Councel holden at Gangris in Paphlagonia about the yere of our lord 324 And these heretiques had sondry vsa¦ges / 27. q. 2 decret. ex Grego. in re¦gstro et caetera and held diuerse opinions / which be in these daies alowed and mayntayned by  the Papists. First / they persuadid the peple to leaue the yoke of matrimony / & to professe abstinēce from mariadge. The Papists teach the lawfulnes herof and the necessitie also of the obseruation of it when it is don / in sondry places of there deuelish cannon law. The preface of this counsell also sayth of these Heretiques. Vestibus communibus spretis, nouos etiam, & in∣solitos habitus assumpsisse (that is) that they did refuse to weare the vsuall garmēts & did put apon them garments of strange fashions And I pray you do not your po¦pish monks / fryers / chanōs / nones / An∣chors / hermets / priests / abbats / priors / bushopes / cardinals / yea ād the pope him self the head of this hereticall sect / doe the lyke? And such a desier haue the monks / fryers etc. to varry from the common sort of peple in apparell / that they cā not ag∣ree among themselues which is best for there purpose / wherin they may most ea∣sely
fayne holynes / and deceaue the peple And therfore haue they asmany colors & fashions of apparell / Gangren cons. ca. xij. and strange kynds of disgysing themselues with shauings / and otherwyse / as they haue diuersities of there religions / which be almost infi∣nit. What is this els but to renyne aga∣ine the strange behauior of these Hereti∣ques the Eustachians condempned as appereth in the old counsell holden so ma¦ni yeres agō? Moreouer the same coun∣sell  sayth of these heretiques thus. Primi∣tias quo{que} fructuum, & oblationes eorum, quas ue∣terum institutio, ecclesijs tribuit, sibimet uendicasse, id est, propria ratiocinatione doctrinae, tanquam sanctis sibi eas offerri dare, apud se, & inter se dis∣pēsandas (that is) Moreouer the first fruts and offerings of the people which by the old institution of the elders and fathers were appointed to the cōgregacions:The first futs for liuing be not vnhonest / but when it is chal∣lendged vnder the name of ho∣lynes. the same did they chalendge to themselues / & that in consideration of there learning & holynes these things ought to be offirid vnto them / and distributid amongest thē as to men that were holy. Now consider good reader wheather the popish priests take the tthes of the peple / and conuert them to there own v∣se / not only taking / that is necessary and
and sufficient to feed & cloth themselues / and conuenient famelie / but also to mayn¦tayne there Epicurishe pompe / as I ha∣ue before declarid / comparing them with Iouinian. And I report me to thee all so wheather they chalendge not (as the other rank heretiques the Eustachians did) these tythes vnder the name of dutie to the holy church / calling themselues (ho¦ly) and that therfore these things should belong vnto them / as these heretiques  the Eustachians did? Fourthly yf a ser∣uant myndid to enter there religion / and to take there habite apon him / he might abyde in there clokid religion / in dispite of his master. And what? se yow not the selfsame in practise / and alowed for godli¦nes  among the Papists. Many of there women / did clypp there heare vnder a pre¦tense of holynes: And do not the popish  nones thesame? Carnium cibos anquā illicitos reputabant, They iudged fleshmeat / as a thing vnlawful? So do the Papists at sondry tymes by them appointid. Moreo¦uer Presbyteros qui Matrimonia contraxerunt sperni debere dicunt (that is) They say / that that such prests as haue contractid mat∣rimonie ought to be cōtempned. Behold
good reader it is an heresie of the Eusta∣chians to cōtempne a maried Priest.It is an heresie of the Eustachans to cōdemp∣ne a maried pr∣est in the furs tom. of the gen∣erall counseles 287. leaf. And therfore did the same coūsell excom̄unicat all those that refusid to receaue the Sa∣crament ministrid at a Maried Priests hāds. These horrible Errors / heresies / & blasphemies against God / the lerned of Christendō / continewingly fiue hundreth yere after Christ condempned & destroied. Which you see / by our new popish hereti¦ques / reuokid / reuiuid / mayntayned ād de¦fended.The papists be vsurpers of the names of Cato¦lik and Ortho∣dox as Nestori¦us and the Do¦natists were ād of the church etc And yet will they haue the name of holy / of Catholik / of Orthodox / as the Eustachiās as Nestorius & the Dōatists wold & of the church / yea & that of suche a church as can not erre. And there aduersaries / must be callid sediciose heretiques / schis∣matiques / theues & traytors. Thus turn they althīgs quyte vpsydoune / light they cal darknes / & darknes light / euell good and good euell. Wherfore it behoueth all men of God / manfulli and without feare to bend themselues against these rank heretiques and enemies of God: and to call apon allmightie God with earnest / feruent / and hartie praier that he will of his infinit goodnes ād mercy throw do Antichrist of Rome the head of there sect with all this shauen sectaries &
trumpery / And purge his church of these rotten & hereticall members. That his luely word / may haue free passage amōge his peple / wherby his chosē flock dispersid / mai be gatherid together to the magnifieng of his holy name / ād the et∣ernall comfort of his afflictid people. Yt were to long a matter / to compare the Papists with all the rest of the heretiks / and requyreth rather a speciall treatise where th hing might be amplified as it is worthy: then  to be touched as ye see  hath caused me for my defence. Yf in this point I haue wrytten any thing that pleaseth thee (good reader) I pray the geue God the thanks and also to render to Martin and his fellowes ther deseruid thanks li∣kewise / Occasion bre∣deth talk. who haue pricked me to proue what I could say when they callid me he¦retique. Somwhat ye see my pē by Gods help hath brought forth. And if Martin and his fellowes continew ther talk / thei may chaunce to here more / that shalbe as pleasant to them as this / if there doings be worth the answer. I haue pen / ink / pa¦per and quietnes God be praisid enough all which they haue aswell as I / But one thing I haue on my syde that they haue
not / which is a comfort to me / and truble to thē / and that is / Trueth.The Papists build not vpon Gods word. Trueth I say is on my side / as it is plaine by my pro∣fes / not groundid apon things that may erre and deceaue (as may traditions and doctrines of man / wherapon the Papists chefely ground themselues) but apon the infallible word of God taught in the old and new Testament / by the holy patri∣arks / prophets / Apostles / ād Christ / and haue addid the testimonies of the most aunceāt and godly Martirs / ād fathers. From whom ye se these heretiques wan∣derid / euery man his own wayes And ye see also that the Papists / folow the here∣tiques / not only one / but many / and that the most notable heretiques / not ōly mat¦chinge / but exceding them / in many of there own heresies and abhominations. Wherof Christiā reader as thow mayst be iudge / remembringe the discourse which I haue made: so trust I that if thy hart be single / and mynde vncorrupt / vp∣right / and voyd of partialitie / the very iudgement of thy conscience will stirre thy tong hereafter to na¦me them as they be.
The VII. Chapter. Martins notable and shameles lyeng / and falsifienge of authors is disclosid / ād confutid concludinge by his own reasons that the Papistes be both Heretiques ād lechors / with a declaration that the chefe old Heretiques and infectors of Christen¦dom with erroneus opinions were vn∣maried Priests or Monks etc? Wherin Martin by his own reason is prouid a lechor an heretique and a traytor. THis long discourse haue I made to this ēd (as I haue / before declarid) that it might appere whether parte were heretiques. And seīg I haue with diligēt wayīg aswell by the scriptures as by aun¦cant wryters (grounding my self apon the very definitiō of an heretique) found Martin and his fellowes giltie with the most rank heretiques that haue bene in the church of god / so that iustly thei cā not deny / but that they haue the ouerthrow I wil take this as a feeld won. And now turning my pen agayn to Martyn thus I resume his maior from the which apon necessary discorse / offerid by Martins or¦der in this book I haue so lōg digressid.
Heresie and lechory sayst thow Mar∣in be commonly ioyned together / Martyns own words. and in he 4 leaf of thy book thow saist (Heresie ysseth not to keep lechory company) wherunto I add this minor or mean pro¦osition. But the Papists be heretiques (which I haue at large prouid) ergo (to on Martyn you Papists be lechors.Martyns reason turned against himself proueth the Pa¦pists both hereti¦ques and le∣chors. Lo t is often tymes seen / he that wilbe busy urling stones at the son̄e / shall haue thē ight apō his own pate. To what purpo∣e I pray the diddest thow speak of Sim. Magus, Basilides, Carpocrates, and such other heretiques / if it were not to geue him oc∣asion / that should confute thy folishnes / to search how the opiniōs of the Papists and thers agre together? Yf it were to declare that because they were Hereti∣ques / they must also be lechors: The sa∣me induction being now brought aga∣inst the and thy fellowes / must be no lesse hable to proue thee and al other Papists echors: seīg they be shewed by plaine de¦monstration to be heretiques Yf it were to proue vs heretiques / because ye fayne vs with your lyeng tong to be lechors / thē shuld it folow / that all whores of the tewes / and whoremongers were hereti¦ques / which I am suer the Papists dare
not say / for feare of inquisitio haereticae prau∣tatis that is now enterid into England  like with the Spaniards to destroy the lbertie of the English nation / The bushops in¦quisition for he∣resy will vndoe England if it e not loid to in tyme. wherby n doubt shortly the noses of the nobiliti shalbe holden to the gryndstone / and th necks of the commons / tyed vnder th priests gyrdels / from which misery I bsech Iesus Christ saue so many as fauo from the bottom of there hart Christ and the noble realm of England. Amen. But it may be / that ye sought som oc∣casion in the beginnīng of your bok to duise a quarell by a color of your Rheto∣rik callid Canina facundia .i. dogges eloquce / Martins weak kynds of reasoning. wherby to bring maried priests int haterid: in alledgīg that the first marie preests in Spayne / in Rome / in ffraunc in Itali / and so forth where ye will / were heretiques. And yet if ye had myndid tha profe / ye shuld haue named none hereti∣ques / but such as were maried priests. But seing all those heretiques whom ye name were vnmaried / as it is euiden by there opinion condempnig mariadge  your argument is turnid against you self / for that they were heretiques / and lchors / as yow hold / and vnmaried virgin priests / as you Papists be. And wha
old ye cōclude therof / if it were trew? old ye by this / define that all maried riests be heretiques? That kind of rea∣oning is not vnlike to this?Gen. 4.

The first hereti¦que that euer was after Christ abhorred the godly mari∣adge of Priests and kept a who∣re.Yf this kind of reasoning seem so goo in your sight▪ then I pray you harken t this other lyke therunto. The first heretque that euer was in all the world afte Christs death was Simon Magus of Samari who hauing not the gyft of sole lyfe / wol not enter the holy state of matrimony / bu folowing / or rather beginning the popihe kinde of chastitie / kept a harlot name Selene / The first hereti¦que in Persia abhorrid the ma¦riadge of priests Aug.

The first Anabap∣tist in Rome was Nouatus the heretik a vnmaried priest whose sect alowed no mariadge in ther preests and denyed rep¦tance to offendors.The first here∣tik in spaine ab∣horred mariad∣ges of priests.

And about a hūdreth yere before him The first notable heretique in Affrica was Arrius an vnmaried priest of Alexandria as both Epiphanius Eusebius / and other do wit¦nes whose virginitie was much lyk to doctor Westons sauing that Arrius, kept himself close / and Doctor westons knaue¦ry is knowen to all men.The first nota∣ble heretik in Armenia and Paphlagonia was an vnma∣ried priest. The first here∣tiks in Paphlagonia, and Armenia were Eu∣stachiani, whose chefe heresie was the con¦dempnīg of priests mariadge / so that thei refusid to receaue the communion at the hands of such priests as were maried for the which thinge they were condempn̄ed as I haue before declarid in the Coūcell holdē at Gangris about the tyme of the Ni∣cene Councell which was cōfirmed by the syxt synod in Trullo /Anno.

And all he¦retiques before the tyme of Heiuidius (if it were trew as vow say that Heluidius were the first maried priest in Christendō) we∣re vnmaried priests: Yet were some of them Stupratores uirginum, & depopulato∣res matrimoniorum rauishers of virgins ād defylers of matrimony as Saint Cyprian wryteth of Nouatus.S.

And now ye see what ye haue wō with reasonīg ab inde finito ad uniuersale. Which kynde of rea∣soning is commonly vsed in the logick of yow Papists. As one speciall place amō∣gest many other / the reader shall fynd in Gardiners bok against my lord of Can̄∣terbery whiche appeareth in my sayd lord of Cāterberies bok in the latter end of the

Yf now Martin / thow canst not deuyse so∣me prety kynde of shift / wherby thow maist recant / and make this reason na∣ught / thow hast shamed thy selfwith thy first Chapter / The som̄e wherof standeth apon this point: that heresy and lechory be commonly ioyned together. Which say¦ing / thou prouest none otherwise trew then that the first maried priests in some countryes were heretiques / and by cer∣tain notes / etc. And like as it is a shame for the in such a weighti matter / to make such a bald reason thoughe thye grounds were trew: so thy grounds being vntrew thy rebuk is increased / for who knoweth not that Saint Peter was a priest? and the gospell restifieth that he had a wyfe / the Euangelists say that Christ healid pe¦ters wyues mother of a feauer.Math. 8. Luc. 4.  lib. 7. Clemens Alex. And Clemens Alexandrinus testifieth that he did not put her away / but continewed with her till she dyed in martyrdom for Christs sake / which Martyn denyeth / ād the same Clement sayeth that Peter spa∣ke to her when she was in dyeng saying
to her Vxor memento Domini wyfe remem∣ber the lord / and that this is trew Saint Hierom against Iouinian can not denye And I am suer thow wilt not denye but that Peter dwelt XXV. yeres at Rome (for so yow Papists hold) Now if it were trew / that the first maried priest in Ita∣ly (as thow dost alledg for the profe of thy purpose) were an heretique / then by this means shuld Peter be an heretique onles thow wilt say that Rome is not in Italy. For that it was not / Heluidius / shalbe reasoned hereafter.Martin can not proue that the first maried priest in Fraun¦ce was an here∣tique by Turo∣tese concili∣um as he alled∣geth. To. ij. pa. ij. And for fur∣ther profe of thy purpose / thow saist also that the first maried priest in Fraūce was an heretique / which saying thow prouest by the second councell holden at Towers / a worthy coūsell I promes yow / of eight frenche pusshops all a great / gathered to¦gether without the popes consent / which marreth all the matter by the iudgement of the Papists. but let it be grauntid that it had bene a generall Coūcell / as it was none / and that the busshops being all Pa¦pists had not bene so: yet doth not the 20. Canon by the alledged proue thy purpo∣se that the first maried priest in Fraunce was an heretique. But it sayth that this opinion (or heresie as this iolly counsell
nameth it) a quodam presbytero primū surrex∣it.Ye may see by the Latin what antiquitie and learning these bushops were of sprang first of a certein priest / not na¦ming where he dwelt / neither whether he were maried or vnmaried / But apon this place ye note vpon the margent of your bok / The first maried priest in Fraūce was an heretique.where all men may see of that place / it may aswell be gathe∣red that it was an vnmaried priest. The place serueth aswell for the one as the o∣ther. Yea & it is to be thought that Here∣sis presbyterorum, not to be of the mariad∣ge of priests of Fraunce / but some other heresy begon by certein priests. For if it had been an heresie / maried priests sho∣uld not haue bene suffered to receaue the communion. Look bak in thy book of ge¦nerall Councells one hundreth yere / and thow shalt fynde another Councell / holdē in the very same place at Towers / in the tyme of Leo the first / where the Councel found falt with there forefathers which had made lawes wherby to remoue mari¦ed priests from the communion / and toke apon them to moderat that wicked law / D.xxxiiij.  in preterito in Glosa. which was before that tyme made by po¦pe Syritius (a man altogether vnler∣ned in the scriptures / as by his re∣asonning hereafter shall appeare)
by the which moderation / The strayt law if Pope  against the ariadge  condemp∣ned by Conci∣lm Turost. i. can. 2.442. after Christ. it is euident that they did condempne the extremitie and vngodly Iudgement of Syritius and other the enemies of priests mariad∣ges. The words of the Canon be these. Al¦though it hath been ordeined by our fore¦fathers that what soeuer priest or deacon were conuictid / that he gaue himself to the procreation of children / he should ab∣staine from the communion of the lord / Nos tamen huic districtioni moderationem adhi∣bentes, & iusta Cōstitutione mollientes id decreui∣mus &c. We not withstanding that ordi∣naunce (sayth the decree) adding a moder¦ation to this rigor / & tempering it with indifferency / Thus haue decreed. That a priest or deacon whiche remaineth in the desier of matrimony / or els absteineth not from procreacion of children / let him not ascend to any higher state or promotion / neither offer sacrifices to God / Maried Priests be not remouid from the com∣munion. or mini∣ster to the peple. This only may be suffi∣cient for them / that they benot remouid from the communion / but that they may kepe these things / they must cut of drun∣kenes the moher of all vices etc. By this Canon it is plaine good rea∣der  that 44 yere after Christ it was no Heresy in fraunce for a preest to haue a
wyfe / nor whordome neither / (as Mar∣tin  vylie termeth it) / neither was it a fil∣thy  thing / for then should the Counsel ha¦ue done amisse to alow him to receaue the communion / 442. after Christ in  it was no  for a preest to haue a wife. which was a more holy thin¦ge than euer was there Idoll the masse caak. And allthoughe the superstition of these french busshops / do somwhat appe∣are in denieng him to minister the com∣munion to other / yet doth ther folishnes appere withall / The Papists seem to hold that the  of the mi∣niser  tite the  / as do the Anbap∣tists / and the Eustachians. in that they alow the ma∣ried priest to receaue it himself / if he were (as Martin sayth) an Heretique. Who cā iudge / a matter of lesse weight to re∣ceaue the communion then to minister it? Belyke they were of this opinion / that the vncleanes of the minister / did hurt the thing ministrid Which was the opinion of the Heretiques named Eustachiani as apereth by the first and 4 Cannons of the Councell holden at Gangris:Gangrense cō∣ciliū, can. 1 et 4 and is at this day the opiniō of the Anabaptists. And Mar¦tin with all such papists / as say that a pri¦est may not marry because of the vnclea∣nes that should be in the minister after lyeng with his wyfe / and therfore may not minister the Sacrament / do declare that it is the plain opinion of the sect of the Papists as I haue partly before tou¦ched.
And although I haue here matter inoughe wherwith to charge the Pa∣pists and Martin ther proctour / concer∣ning this point / that the vncleanes of the minister ought not to be regarded / in case that mariadge could make the minister vnclean (as none but heretiques and Pa¦pists say): I will leaue that matter vn¦till another place / where I intend to de∣bate more at large the cleanes of mariad¦ge in all states / Martins lye. for this present it shal be sufficient for the reader to vnderstand / that Martin maketh a lye in telling the reader / Synodus Turo¦nen. 2. ca. 13. Et. ca. 14. that the 30. Canon of the secōd Councell at Towers / in Fraunce proueth that the first maried priest in Fraūce was an Heretique. I passe ouer / that euen in thesame 2. popish prouinciall counsell of Towers in Fraunce the XIII. canon grā¦teth the busshop to haue his wyfe as his sister. and so rule the ecclesiasticall ād his owne house / And allso that the XIII. Can¦on of the same councell maketh mention of the busshops wyfe calling her Episcopa.Episcopa. That is to say the busshops wyf or busshopes / charging all busshops that lak wyues / that they shall haue no cum∣pany or trayne of women folowing them etc. onles they haue wyues. And to set
one Papist aynst another and to bea you with  oun Doctors look in the bok named Manipulus Curatorum /Manipulus Curatorum. wher the Papist Guido de monte Rocherij. confesseth speakinge of the Sacrament of orders / that in the primatiue churche / preests had wyues / and that they were callid Presbyte∣rae / and these be his very words. Pressbyte∣ra autem uocatur, quia secundum morem primiti∣uae ecclesiae erat uxor presbyteri / (that is to say / the preests wif is callid Presbytera /Presbytera. becau∣se that accordinge to the fashion of the primitiue Church / she was the preestes wyf. And thus ye see that we doe not only proue by your own Doctors that preests had wiues in the primatiue churche / but we also shew how they were then named.S. Hylary bus¦hop of Potiers in fraunce was maried MCC yeres agon. And I will also teache Martin that this is wrytten of S. Hylary bushop of poti∣ers in France (two hundreth yere before the 2. Coūsell at Towers that he alledged) that he was both a bushop / and a ma∣ried bushop / And lest Martyn shuld say that he absteined from his wyfe / which he had before he was busshop (as he fasly sayth all busshops do) I shall desier the to call to remembrāce / the epistle that he wrote beīg an old mā (as he saith himself the¦re)
to his doughter Abram, who was so yong that he doutid whether she could vn¦derstand his wryting or not / The words of Bussop Hila∣ri to his daugh∣ter Abram. and therfo∣re said vnto her Tu uero si quid minus, per ae∣tatem in hymno, & epistola intelligis, interroga matrem tuam. Yf by reason of your tēder age / ye can not vnderstand the hympne & the Epistle / aske your mother / and imme¦diatly he calleth her his most dear daug∣hter. Wherby it may appeare in Saint Hylaries dayes it was lawfull for a bushop in Fraunce to haue a wyfe / for otherwise the holy man Hylary / wold not ha∣ue vsid it. And the age of himself / and the youth of his daughter / seē to proue that she was begotten after he was made bushop.Martin con∣dempneth S. Hilary for an Heretique. But Martyn lyke himself / triumpheth saying no bushops had wyues bu heretiques / wherin his rayling tōg con∣dempneth Hylary for an Heretique / i any man wold beleue him / But his ton∣ge is no slaūder / to all such as know him God be praisid. Also for further profe of his purpose he alledged out of Sain Hierom against Heluidius that the firs maried priest in Italy / Martin  S. Hierō. yea in the whol world (as he saith) was an Heretique Mark now good reader and thow sha
here a gloriose lye of Martins. I call it gloriose / because he hath set it forth with such a glory not here only / but hereafter in the 118. leaf also.Fo. iij. Mar∣tins un words Martīs words in his first place be these. In Italy the first pre¦est that maried: was he any better? (mea¦ning then an heretique) S. Hierom saith it was Heluidius the heretique which de¦yed our blissid lady to haue continued a vgin. These be the words of the great clk Master Doctor Martī the lawyer (as off hīself he sayth) but I might / bet∣ter haue said / of D. Martin the lyar. For doutles he is a thousand fold better seen in lyeng then lawīg. Which appereth not only by the most parte of the notes in the margēt in his first Chapter (pointing to the text of lyke trueth) that be most com∣menly lyes: but also by this place / and an infinit nomber of other / wher he belieth falsly the old Wryters / not only in falsly turning them / and wrything there say∣ings against there meanings: but also in most falsly aduouching them to say / Martin belie∣eth the old wry¦tes. that they say not / as in this place / he maketh a most shamfull lye apon Saint Hierom. for I assuer the good reader that Saint Hierom saith not in all his book against Heluidius that he was (as Martin re∣porteth)
the first maried priest in Itally No Saint Hierom saith not that Helui¦dius was maried / and how may it then be trew that Saint Hierom saith he was the first maried priest in Italy? So now ye see that Martin is not contentid to make one lye apon Saint Hierom / but he must also lay one in anothers neck / re∣porting Saint Hierom to say that Hel∣uidius was the first priest that maried in Italy: because it is a lye that he was ma¦ried at al / And yet sayth Martī S. Hie∣rom reporteth that he was not only mari¦ed / but also the first maried priest in Ita∣ly. And in this point also Martin is not a litle to be blamed that he doth not only belye Saint Hierom / but also the thing it self is a lye which he faineth S. Hierom to say,Martin ascry∣beth a lye to S. Hierom. But yow will aske me how I can proue that Saint Hierom sa¦ith not so? Forsoth two waies / First I am contentid to be iudged by the whole book which S. Hierom hath wrytten against Heluidius. Secondarily I am cōtent to let Martin himself be iudge / for these be his words which immediatly folow this lye before wrytē.Martins words. And (sayth Martī) he saith not (meaning by S. Hie) that he was the first maried priest in Italy / Loe
god reader what neede I to haue any fur¦ther condempnacion for Martin in this point / then his own pen? Well doth S. Hie. say so? no verily sayth Martin. why thē for shame suffereth he those lines be∣fore in the text?A note to be put in the margent of Martins book. & that note in the mar∣gent / to stād in his book / without adding vnto it / some such note as this is? Beleue not Mar. in this place / for here he lyeth gregioly. Why but I pray you / is it not enoghe for Martī to say that Saint Hierom saith not so? yes forsoth enoghe o proue the other saying a lye.Note that Martin tur∣neth the word Sacerdos by the englishe word spiritu∣all. But to rocede / if S. Hierom say not so / I pray ou what saith he? marry (saith Martin) He saieth not that he was the first mari¦d priest in Italy. But the first priest that ecame both spirituall and temporall in  the whole world.Martin defen∣deth one lye with another. Now belike Martin ath lokid so narrowly to his matters hat he will not be taken with his accu∣omed fashion of lyenge. But what will  say if this also be a lie? think yow not  thē he were a meet man to lye for the hetstone? Verely god read this is no les  lye thē the other for this saying is not  all Saint Hierom neither / wherby  may se his Tonge so accustomed to  / that he can not when he Wold /
say trueth? But I pray yow what sa∣ith S. Hierō of Heluidius? forsoth that which foloweth in Latin in Martīs own boke. these be his words. Solus in uniuerso mundo laicus simul & sacerdos, The English wherof is this: he ōly in the whole world was both at once a priest and a lay man. In the whiche words thow maiest see good reader / that there is no mēcion nei∣ther that he was the first maried prist in Italy / neither that he was the first mari¦ed priest in all the whole world / neither that he was maried onles ye wil say that all lay men be maried / yea if it were trew that all lay men were maried men yet is there neuer a word in Saint Hierom neither of (Italy)Martins ma∣nifest vntreuth in alledginge ol¦de authors. nor of (first) nor of (last) nor of (mariadge) Now may you see what credit is to be geuē to Martin wh̄ he alledgeth old authors. But it may be peraduenture he will say the printer de∣ceaued him / and put it in of his own head I think there be now / plentie of such priters in England that prynt they care no what / so they may gaine neuer so litle though it be horrible blasphemy agains God & his Aūgels as in the books tha com forth dayly pryntid by Cawawoo and such lyke appeareth. But Marti
can not escape so / for in 118 leaf 1. G. pa. 2. he maketh the selfsame lye agayn / and sa¦ith also there / that the heretique Heluidi¦us was the first maried priest that we re¦ad of in all Christēdom.Martin con∣firmeth this lie with repeating the same in the 118. leaf 1. g. 2. pag. 2. Yt is the proper∣tie of some lyers / when they haue told a lye ones or twyse or oftner / that by often telling of there lyes to other / at last they think them true themselues / ād so it may be that Martin by often telling this vai¦ne fable / doth now think it is a most true story. But seing it is plainly shewed that Martyn fayleth in the profe of his gro∣unds where he intendid to proue by in∣duction / the first maried priest in Italy / ād in France / & so forth / were heretiques (thoughe he were able to make some pro¦fe of other maried priests in other cun∣tryes)A plain decla∣ration that Martins rea∣sons proue not. yet can not his reason hold as I haue at large before declarid / because so∣me partes of the Induction being impro¦uid / the reason rūneth but from an inde∣finite / to an vniuersall / which kynd of re¦asoning yong Sophisters in Cambridge be shent when they vse. But Martin fearing lest all his brab¦ling will not serue his turn / hath pyked out a pece of Saint Hierom / where he se¦meth to note certain properties and qua∣lities
/ which he sayth be commonly in he¦retiques / and stryueth to aply the same to such as had professed Christs gospell in England. The words be these / as he doth alledge them.Notes pikid out of S. Hie∣rom by Mar∣tin wher by to know an hereti∣que. Raro haereici dili∣gunt castitalem, & quicunque amare pudicitiam se simulant ut Manichaeus, Martion, Arrius, Tati∣anus, & instauratores ueteris haereseos, Venenato ore mella promittunt, caeterum iuxta Apostolum quae secretè agunt, turpe est diere. The English wherof (as you Martin haue handelid it) doth euidently proue that yow vnderstode not the latin / for this place doth so playnly set furth the proper¦ties of the popish virgin priests / and of the other Papists / that in all Saint Hie¦rom there can not lightly be found a bet∣ter. wherfore that the reader may vnder∣stand the true sence of it / I will translate it truly / that your falshod in translation may apperare when my translation and yours shalbe laid together.Hierom. li. ij. in Osce. ix. Heretiques (saith S. Hierom) ād all suche as pretēd that they loue Chastitie / do very seldom lue it in deed / As Manichaeus, Martion, Arrius▪ Tatianus, / and the renewers of the old heresie. They promise hon with a poysoned mouth / but according to the saying of the Apostle / it i
a filthie thing to vtter what they doe in secret. Now mark good reader Saint Hierom in this place inueieth sharply a¦gainst the old Heretiques which wold not marry themselues / The places of S. Hierom bro¦ught in by Martin be dy∣rectly against himself. nor alow mariad¦ge in other but pretendid such a holynes with a shew of virginitie / and hatered of mariadge / that with there holy looks & sweet words they deceauid the peple. Wherby thow maist well perceaue that this place of Saint Hierō maketh fully against such priests as say they ha∣ue the gyft of Chastitie / and haue it not / that lyue in whoredom and marry not / that pretend holynes in the sight of the peple but lead a filthy lyfe in corners / ād in secret. And for example he nameth a nomber of heretiks that were vnmari∣ed priests / as the popish preests be / and thought mariadge to be to vnclean a thing / to be in a minister / as all the Pa∣pists doe / let Martin himself denye yf he can that these were vnmaried / so that ther is nothinge here / that agreeth not fully with the Papists. Lo how ignorance blin¦deth Martins eyes. Ye may see how he s felled with his own weapon. All the it he had culd not / or els of frowardnes e wold not / make a sence of this place.
But note his impudency / In his transla¦tion out of the latin into the English / Words addid by Martin in Englishing the latin wich be not in the latin of S. Hierom. he putteth in these words (against the Sa∣crament of matrimony) which be not in the latin / mynding as it semeth by a sle∣ight / for want of other profe to perswa∣de the vnlerned reader by this peece of S. Hierom̄ that mariadge is a Sacramēt. Which if it so did / yet were it no more for his purpose in this place / then any va¦yne talk of the moone / or other by matter. So in this place we haue also an other testimony of Martīs falshod. & see plain¦ly that the notes / Martins own markes declare hym an heretik. wherby he myndid to haue (with the authoritie of Saint Hie∣rom) descrybed vs / do paint himself and his popish virgin priests euidently to our eyes. But Martin suspecting by lyk that these notes also / either could not at al / or not sufficiently serue his purpose / he procedeth to another pece of S. Hie∣rom.Hierom in Hie¦re .xxiiij. educinge as before / his reason  posteriore / trusting that now he hath foūd out such notes / wherby to proue vs here∣tiques / as we can not auoyd. And his notes be these. They geue themselues t gluttony to delicatnes / to eating of flesh (whom therfor Martin calleth fleshmogers) to haunting of baynes / they smel
of musk and perfumes / and with sondry other ointments they procure themselu∣es to be bewtifull of body. I think Mar¦tyn wold neuer haue medled with this place / Another place of S. Hierom brought in by Martin is a∣gainst himself. if it had not bene for a desier that he had to turne the latin words (carnibus uescuntur) by the new found english term of fleshmongers / rather then the eating of flesh / as the word soundeth / but the de∣uise of such fantasticall termes agreeth wel with Martins pen / But to the pur∣pose of this note / all mē know right well that as absteinīg / These old here∣tiques were con¦dempned amon¦gest other opini¦on for that theī disswadid men from eating of flesh. doth not proue a good Christian man / so doth not eating of flesh proue a mā an heretique / Manichaei, Tatia∣ni, Montani, Cataphryges, Aeriani, Priscillianistae Saturninus, Basilidiani, and many other old archheretiks absteined from flesh and taught this Doctrine that the eating of flesh did defyle a Christian man / and yet notwithstanding there doctrine and ab∣stinence / they were rank Heretiques. Wherfore it semeth that S. Hierom did not finde falt with them that eat flesh but with them that eat it not for the satis∣fiēg of there honger / but of their pleasu∣re and in such case the eating of fish or of bread other / is not commendid. The Chri¦sten man abhorreth superfluous dyet / ād
the vayn pleasur that is increased of ea∣ting without necessitie / The dyet of a Christian man. and without re∣spect of the kynd / whether it be fish or flesh / knowing that all creatures of God be good / if they be taken with thanks ge¦uing / for they be sanctified by the word of God and praier.1. Timoth. 4. And also that which en¦treth the mouth / defileth not the man but that which commeth out of the mouth de¦fileth the man / Math. 15. (that is to say) euell thou¦ghts / murther / adultery / whoredō theft false ortnes / Martin with his notes ma∣keth the Papists heretiks and slaunder. And where as Martin thinketh the other notes / as smellinge of muske / and washing in bay¦nes / and paintinge of faces etc. be notes wherby to know Heretiques: Then it is an easie matter in princes courtes / ād busshops houses / and many other mens houses also / to fynde out Heretiques by the nose / without the popes kynde of In∣quisitio haereticae prauitatis. Yf (I say) the sa∣uors of Cyet / musk / perfumes / and oint¦ments be sufficient notes to proue an heretik (as Martins diuinitie out of S. Hierom semeth to inferre) Then must it also folow / How a man man finde out the rankest here∣tik in a compa∣ny with his no∣te by Martins doctrine. that the greater & strōger sa∣uor shall proue the greater and stronger heretique And then if a man wold finde out the Rākest heretique in a company /
his best way is to get him to a popish procession / (for sermons be laid a syde which reproued the abuse of such things) or to Masse / specially apon a highe day / ād he shall try out by his nose / who is not only an heretik / but also who is the most arrant / and most rank Heretique aboue the rest. And it is lyke that the fayerer / and greater nose shall doe (in this case) the better seruice / ād therfor it might be thought good that the Queē / in bestow∣ing her bushopriks / should consider not so muche the learninge of the party / as whether he haue a fayer nose or not that is skilfull in sauors. For the bushops no∣se (by this doctrin of Marrin) shall doe him as good seruice / as some handsom Sōner / & in deed might some tyme smel out his maister / for the most can kerid he¦retique in the company. Well seing it is so that we be condempned for heretiks because we smell of perfumes & hote sa∣uors / and delicate fare etc (Yf it be trew that Martin saith) Then take you heed / you seely sould Papists / of your needles break fasts / of your stretchbelly din̄ers / of your gluttonuse suppers / reare suppers blowsinge bākets / & Epicureus fare: Ta¦ke heed of your hote wynes / of your hote spyces / and continuall iunketing chere /

And as tou¦ching my self and other / whom it pleaseth his masshepe / to call heretiks / we are cō∣tentid let this be the issew: wheather of the Papists or of vs haue more of these notes / let thē be callid heretiks with sha∣me enoughe / ād let the other syde be cal∣lid Catholiks and Christiās according to his clerkly determinatiō.Martin.

Hierom saith he speaketh of them  qui pudicitiam amare se simulant (as Martī also alledgeth) that is / Lib. 2. in 9. ca∣put Osee. which pre¦tend they haue a loue to chastitie) shewed plainly that his sayings must be applyed to such vnmaried / as the popish Priests be / and can not be applyed to them which without dissembling there infirmitie for the auoyding of fornicacion take them wyues / and liue in the godly state of ma∣trimony Also besyds his plain words qui pudici tiam amare se simulant. i. Which pretend that they loue Chastitie / the heretiks whō S. Hierom reherseth for profe and example wer vnmaried priests / Hierom in ca. xi Daniel. and therfore (as thow seest) must needs be applied to such a wyueles dissembling generatiō / as the same Hierom noteth Antichrist there ho¦ly father. Yea and it is further to be thought that if he were this day aliue / he wold commend . Luther / Oecolampa∣dius, D. Capito, Bucer, & . Peter Martyr / for the sinceritie of there doctrine / & for that with wryting apon the Scryptures they haue geuen such a light / as Saint Hierom his eyes wold be ioyfull to see thoughe it were with the retractation of
other things / besyds those wherwith his freends charged him in his books aga∣inst Iouinian and such lyke as I haue noted before. Yt is like that you fell into this wishe of Saint Hieroms lyfe in these dayes / because ye wold fynde some way to tell the world (that Oecolampadius, Capito,Capito was no munk nor frer as Martin re∣porteth fol. iij. and Munster, were munks or fry∣ars and afterward maried men. No man can iudge otherwise that noteth your pro¦ces / and perceaueth the desier that your tonge hath to lyeng. Well seing Capito was no munk nor fryer (as you report him) ye shall not chuse but suffer me to say to you this is another of your lyes / for it is trew that of these all that you report he was neither monk nor fryar. And in case they had beene as D. Luther. D. Bucer & the other were / it could neither further your matter / nor hurt ours / onles it be to ease your tong a litle / when it is desyrose to rayle. And where yow say ther mariad¦ge was both against the law of God / and the law of man / and also where in the se∣cond chapter of your book yow say it is an old heresie new scowerid I dout not before I haue done with yow and your fellowes / ye shall see it prouid befo∣re your face / that it is an old trueth
taught by Christ and his Apostles / new∣ly by you Papists and Gods enemies ma¦de heresie.The mariadge of priests is an old trueth / new∣ly made heresie by the Papists. In which discourse it shall al¦o appeare / that D. Luther. D. Martyr / etc. were not the first founders of this religi∣on (as yow slanderosly reporte) but the patriarches / the prophets and Christ and his Apostles. But to maintaine your lye withall / ye digresse from your argu∣ent / and fall to slandering of Luther nd the rest / alledging that he robbed Christs church of one of the Sacraments allid the holy Sacrament of Matrimo¦y. Martin vnder¦standeth not the Christian men when they say matrimony is no Sacrament and how that is to be vnder∣standed. Thus Martin trouleth his tong t will / not knowing those lerned mens ayings concernīg matrimony / whether & how they think it a Sacramēt or not / wherfore thow shalt vnderstand good re¦der that the opinion of these lerned fa∣hers / and of all other that fear God / in hese dayes / is groundid apon Gods ord / and it is this. Yf ye take the name f this word Sacrament largyly and am lye / for any such action / or thing as may epresent another holy thing / The word (Sa¦crament) may diuersly be ta∣ken. then they enye not but that Matrimonie is a Sacrament because it representeth vn∣ vs the coniunction of Christ with his hurch. Wherof there is a plaine
testimony of Saint Paule in his Epistle to the Ephesians.Eph. ij. Howbeit taking the word (Sacrament) after this sort ye shalbe forced to confesse / that there be not only seuen Sacraments:Bernard Ser. In cena Do∣mini▪ but also a great nomber more / as the washīg of feet / The wypīg of the dust from the feet of the A∣postles / The embracing of yong children in the armes / Iohann. 13. Luc. 9.10. And the most parte of all Christs actions. But if ye restraine the name and word (Sacrament) not only to those actions which represent spirituall thīgs / but also to those which be appoin∣ted in the new Testament by our Saui∣our and his Apostles to be ministrid by certaine words with commandement t thesame / that they shuld so be ministerid with the offer and promes of forgeuenes of sinnes: Then can not matrimo∣nie be put in the number of Sacramēts namely of the new Testament / because i was ordeined in Paradise before Adam fall.Longe tyme af¦ter Christ / ma∣trimony was not ministerid at church as pla¦tina wryteth and other 5. q. 5. aliter. And matrimonie ministred befor Christendō held after Christēdom 1. Cor.  Si infidelis discedit, discedat. Ergo matrimon is not a Sacrament of the new Testa∣ment. And ye read not that / Matrimo∣nie was ministrid by a priest at church vtill the tyme of pope Euaristus or vntill th
tyme of pope Sother (as Platina wryteth in his lyfe) who was 170 yere after Christ and for the auoyding of priuie contracts made first that decree / that matrimonie should be celebrat at church and by a priest. But seing Martī brought in this matter but for a raylīg purpose / I wil lea¦ue it of with these few words for this pre¦sent. And will tell the good reader of a∣nother solempne lye that Martin hath made whyles his tong runeth railīg af∣ter D. Luther.Martin beli∣eth Luth. alled∣ging his book de capiuitate Babylonica. And Pighius also. He saith there / that Lu∣ther hath wrytten in his book De Captiui∣tate. Babylonica, Si uxor nō possit, aut non uult, an∣cilla uenito. (that is to say) if the good wy∣fe can not / or will not / the good man may take his maid / Speak again Martī / whe¦re saith Luther these words? thow saist in his book de captiuitate Babylonica. The self same lye maketh Pighius of Lut. Contro∣uersia 15. Take that book in thy hand good reader / and read it ouer / and whan thow findest there / as Martin doth re∣port / I am content let it be said that I ha¦ue slaunderid Martī / if not / testifie with me that he is a lyeng witnes / and one of those Doctors whom Saint Peter cal∣leth / Pseudoprophetas in populo /2. Pe. 2. and falsos Doc∣tores qui clam inducent sectas perniciosas.
False prophets amongest the peple / and false lyeng Docturs / which shall pri¦uily bring in perniciose sectes: I assuer the good reader this is a foule lye that Martyn the lyer and Pighius his fellow maketh of Luther / for that saying which they alledge in latyn / as thoughe it had been so by Luther penned / is not in all that booke / where Martyn most shame∣fully aduoucheth the same to be. Schame ye not you Papists that suche a loud lyēg babler / and so false and vaine a man hath taken apon him the defense of your cau∣se? whose own mouth and pen condem∣pneth for an opē lyer? Tremble ye not to shed any mans blud / apon the report of such an impudent man as he is? I will not hyde from the good reader / Luthers iudgemēt in that book / concerning that matter. In one place there speaking of the impediments of matrimony / he saith that if the man be such a one by nature that it is impossible for him to doe the du¦etie of a husband:The Papists can not abyde luther when he teacheth ther own doctrine xxxiij. q. i. quod aūt interrog. then his contract with a woman / shall not bynde her to be his wyf and this is his reason. quia error, & ignorantia uirilis impotentiae, hic impedit matri∣monium.

Vir & mulier si se comunxerint: & di xerit postea mulier de uiro, quod coire non possit cum ea, si possit probare quod uerum sit per iustum iudicium, accipiat alium. Yf a man and a woman be maried together (saith the pope) and the woman afterward say that the man can haue no carnall knowledge of her / and can bring forth lawfull profe therof / let her take another. Moreouer before in the same question and afterward / 33. q. i. si quis. in the Chapter (Si quis) These words be plain and in maner the very same that Luther hath spoken.

But the hi∣story that Martin ascribed to the Empe∣ror Michael Paleologus / was (as he himself saith) when pope Nicholas (about the ye∣re of our lurd 860) sent out an excommuni¦cation against Photius Patriarch of Con∣stantinople. And so it foloweth that Mich¦ael Palaeologus the Emperour was (if Mar¦tins tale could be trew)Yet another. lye of Mar∣tins. fower hundreth yere before be was born / wherby it should seem that Martins talk in this place is a notable fayned lye and so muche the mo¦re lyke to be a lye because he is in all the rest of his book so geuen to lyeng. But let it be trew that Michaell the sixt (between whom and pope Nicholas the first / the contention was / for Ignatius / and Photius) were named Michaell Palaeolo∣gus: (which I say Martin can not proue)
yet the history that Martin ioyneth to this matter / (that is) that he hath red the cause of the contention between pope Ni¦cholas the first and him / was for a plea∣sur that the said Emperor should shew to his vncle for the putting away of his lawfull wyfe / and marieng his daughter in law / I think be not altogether trew. King Henry the viij.But that somwhat in this history is ad¦ded of Martins own forging / desyring to haue some color for his quarell when he intended to slaunder kyng Henry the eight the Queens father / which intent of his appereth / whē he wisheth that the ly¦ke had not been practised els where. And somwhat this my suspicion is increasid by that Martī refuseth to name the Gre¦ek author / These epistles ye shall haue To. ij. Concili¦orum generali∣um pag. 746. whom he alledgeth. And ag∣aine where as in the books of generall Counsels / the earnest epistles wrytten frō Nicholas the pope / to the Emperour Mi¦chaell the sixt (for in those dayes there we¦re none named Paleologus as Martin saith) speak of the putting out of Ignati¦us and the putting in of Photius / That the here∣sie against the holy gost began many yeres be∣fore Michaell Paleologus the Emperour was born. into the office of the patriark / no mention is made of any such matter / which is not ly¦ke the pope wold haue left out / being (as Martin alledgeth) the chefe cause of ther falling out / & speaking so stoutly to the
Emperour / and taunting him so vylie as his Antichristian boldnes doth. But how much soeuer of the history is trew / this chefe point that Martin alledgeth the history for / (that is that the heresie against the holy gost and the contention therof sprang apon this occasion) this (I say) is manifestly false / Another lye of Martins. as by sundry sub∣stanciall reasons I will proue plain to such as haue any knowledge of the doing in generall Counsels / and be not as Mar¦tin is arrogantly wyse:Martins falsi¦fyeth histories. wyse (I say) in there own conceyt and not in deed. For profe wherof / first and formest it apper∣eth in the fift book and tenth Chapter of the history of Theodoret / Theodoret li. v ca. x. an old Greek author by the confeszion of pope Dama∣sus (fyue hundreth yere before the tyme of that Emperor whom Martin falsly nameth Michaell Palaeologus)Pope Dama∣sus. which confesz∣ion he sent to Paulinus bushop of Thessaloni∣ca in Macedonia that anon after the Nicene Counsell sprang contention for doctrine against the holy gost / Paulinus bus∣hop of thessalo∣nica. & that such a busi∣nes ensewed therof that the fathers we∣re fayne to punnish the offenders therin by excom̄unication.Toletanum cō¦cil. i. Wherapō it folowed that both in Toletano concilio 1. about 400. yere after Christ & also in the secōd Coun∣sell

You fauorers of Martin behold your own folly. Furthermore the decree o Eugenius the 4 wherby the vnion of the e∣ast and west churches was declared / doth shew (as the same pope Eugenius doth cofesse)
that this dissention for the proce∣ding of the holy gost / began nongentis & amplius annis (that is to say) more thē ny∣ne hundreth yere before his tyme. And Eugenius the 4. began his rule in the yere of our lord 1431. Out of the which nomber if ye take 900 and more accor∣ding to pope Eugenius his account / it shall appere that Michaell Pelaeologus (tho∣ugh he were in the tyme of Nicholas the first as Martin falsly reporteth) was ab¦oue 300 yere after this dissention began / which Martin for maintenance of his ly¦es saith began in his tyme. Yf I should bring in the first Coun∣sell holden at Constantinople against Eu∣nomius for denieng the proceszion of the ho¦ly gost from the father and the sone what can Martin say? Against this Eunomius / Basill and other hath writtē plentifulli. Thus ye see concerning the begin̄ing of this heresie against the holi gost / Mar¦tin is foūd a falsyfier of histories / not on∣ly by the suputation of yeres / but also by the very testimony of the pope hīself his God. Now concerning the cause of the dissention between the Greeks / and the Latins wher with Martin charged the Emperor Michael Palaeologus.
Martin pro∣uid a foule lyer by Bessarion a Cardinall in oratione dog∣matica pro uni¦one Ecclesiae Graecae & La∣tinae, cap. 2.The learned man Cardinall Bessarion pa∣triarch of Constantinople and Archebus∣hop of Nicea wryteth a whole Chapter for declaration of the cause of this schis∣me and dissention: shewing that the bush¦hop of Rome was the causer therof for that he. Sua unius authoritate fretus aduocata sy¦nodo generali particulam illam communi symbo∣lo fidei, non cum communi assensu ascripsit. (that is) when he had callid a generall Coun∣sell / he tooke apon him of his own priuat authoritie / to adde this parcell (.i. of the proceding of the holy gost from the fat∣her and the sun to the commō Creed / with out the consent of the rest of the other bus¦hops there assembled. Behold good re¦ader a plain prof / that it was the rashe / and termerose boldnes of the bushop of Rome that causid this dissention / who of his oune authoritie wold doe that tumul¦tuosly / The pope was the cause of the dissension bet∣ween the greek and the latin churche contra∣y to Martin. which he might haue done with others consents quietly / and that was it which caused first all that dissention that ensued and also the latter ruine mischefe Destruction / and Turkishe Captiuitie / which Martin faith is this day lighted apon the church of God in Grecia. But Martin will say the thing that he did was Good:
Yea but the maner of the doīg was suche as I thīk Martin / if he thorowly knew it / as he wold seme to do / he himself (for all his foly) will not yet defend it / And the inconueniences that folowed the popes brainles and beastly audacitie / declare that the meanes which he vsid in compas¦sing his doings / were wicked and deue∣lish. So that wher as Martin impu∣teth the breche and contention between the Greek and latin church and the ouer throw / both of the Grecians church and kingdom / to the lecherose lyfe of the vn∣kle to the Emperour Michaell Palaeologus: it is prouid / that the Pope / the author of al mischefe in the church of God / was the only matche that kindled this fier. A wor¦thi matter doutles to depryue the Pope for euer after bearing any rule though there were nothing els wherwith to char¦ge him.Two lyes at a∣cast of Mar∣tins. And thus is Martin once a∣gain ouerthrown with his own reason & taken with a duble lye: aswell for alled¦ging the heresie against the holy gost to begin so lately / which began so many hū¦dreth yere before / As for auouching the dissention which arose between the east and the west church to procede first of the lechory and Ambition /
(as he termeth it in his note in the mar∣gēt) of the Emperour Michael Palaeologus & his vncle / To .iij. genera∣lium concilio∣rum. which proceded first (as ye see by the testimony of Bessariō) from Gods great enemie / the pope the Archheretik in Christendom. Now to make an end of answer to that few lynes which remay¦ne in Martins first Chapter / I need not to take further paines / because they be nothing ells but lyes & raylings / groun¦ded apon false grounds as I haue before declarid / only to this ēd / that king Hen∣the eight the Queens father might appe¦re to the world both a lechor an heretique and a mā full of all other wickednes / out of whose naughty lyfe Martī wold haue al the preachīg in King Edwards dayes which he calleth heresie / to haue his first Originall. And the procedings of the la∣te parliament in the second yere of the Queens raigne / wherin all her fathers doings in religion be condempned / seme to confirm the same. So that the Que∣ens father (if he had bene such a man as the Papists report him) were now con∣demned with vs. Wherfore it is to be thought / seing almightie God hath per∣mitted some of vs / to suffir martyrdom by fyer / by blody persecution and the Ty∣rannie
of the popes law / and tormentes for professing the trueth of Gods word: that now the body of that noble Prince the Queens father (because he was the beginner of all this as Martin repor∣teth / Yf king Hen∣ry the viij. were an heretik why lyeth his body at windsore vn¦inied. and the continewer of it XXV. yere / as the procedings of the parlament seem to pronoūce) shalbe taken vp at windsor and burned as wicklyffes was. All men of wisdom and discretion may well iud∣ge of thee (if thou were not as thou she∣west thy self / a shameles rayler voyd of all regard / against whom thy tong tal∣keth) that it had been thy parte to haue couerid the fault of the Queens father / if thou haddest any fault wherwith to charge him / lest the world perceaue some vnnaturalnes in her / so to suffer her no∣ble father now being dead / to be rayled apon by one who shewed himself a tray∣tor to him when he was a lyue. All the world right well knoweth / that there is no spark / nether of Gods spirite / neither of good nature / in those children / which are not greued to here / there dead parēts euell reported / and there faults reueled. Such is the reuerence dew to them that be dead / vnto whom we ought obedien∣ce in the tyme of there tyfe / And what /

I pray you brethren (saist thow out of Saint Paule) beware of them who cause dissentions / and offen¦ces against the doctrine which you haue lerned / and voyd your selfes from there company / and flee them / for such persons serue not Christ our lord but there belly. These be Saint Paules words by thee al¦egid. To this Maior / or grownd I adde this Minor or mean proposition. But you Papists cause dissentions and offen∣ses against the doctrine that S. Paule taught in thesame Epistle to the Rom∣ains (of which doctrin he there speaketh) in that ye hold a man is made righteous by his works / The Papistes dissent from S. Paules doctri∣ne. and that a man of himself may merite eternal saluation / and in your other opinions of originall sinn / of me∣rits / and fre will / and against the eternal predestination of God / and against the obedience of certain of your shauen gener¦ation to magistrats / as of the pope / who is in deed a subiect to the superiall power and yet yow exclude him / from all obedi∣ence / and of your monks ad such lyke: Ye and more ouer you teache other Doctri∣nes of pardons / of pilgremages / of wor∣shipping of Images / of masse / and diri∣ges

Paule tea∣cheth al men to beware fo the Papists / by the place by mar¦tin alledged. biddeth all men vnder the name of the Romaines to be∣ware of you Papists / and such like rank heretiks as you be / because ye be not the ministers and seruants of Christ (as you pretend) but ye make Christ your seruāt and instrument wherby to feed your fat belyes as Saint Paule there saith / Rom. 16. with out regard to the feding of the soules cō∣mitted to your charge by the lyuely word of God / The Papistes maake Christ ther seruant. but feed them with traditions & doctrins of your own makinge / which is neither grounded / neither can by any me¦anes be deduced out of the lyuely word of God / as you your selues neither can / nor o denye / in that yow hold ād defend this lasphemose heresie. That althīgs neces∣ary for our saluation are not conteined n the scripture / which is asmuche to say /
as we ought to dissent and receaue some doctrines besids that doctrin that the Ro¦maines had receaued by the teachings of S Paule cōtrary to the text by the al∣ledged. Yea al the doctrin of the pope chopt to gether and mingellid as herbes to the pott / and couched in his Antichri∣stian law / is almost nothing els / then a lomp of lerning besids and against the ly¦uely word of God. Now therfore good reader I will end as Saint Paule doth / desiering and bese¦ching the in the name of Iesus Christ / to beware of all the Papists / and all other heretiks that cause dissentions / and offences against the doctrine which you haue learned / out of Gods word / and shune and flye the cōpaines of such / for they serue not Christ our lord but there own bellyes.
