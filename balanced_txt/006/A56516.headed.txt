Prophesies, Predictions, and Astrolo∣gical Prognostications, &c. ALL Men must of necessity acknowledge an over-ruling Power the Business of Mankind, and that the Affairs of Kingdoms, Empires, and States are Moulded in Hea∣ven, by the wise disposal of the Governour of all things; even this the Heathens and Infidels, as well as Christians, have held as an undeniable Truth, in all Ages; and therefore it can be no new Tenent or Doctrine to the knowing part of Mankind: and how far the Wise disposer of all things has communicated the Effects to the Operation of the Coelestial Bodies, who hand many things to us by their Influences, in the way of secundary Causes, is in part left to the Art and Industry of the Learned to observe and transmit to those whose Learning, or more inqui∣sitive Faculties are rendered uncapable of prying into such nice Matters, through Imbecility, the hurry of Business, or many other Emergencies that are incident to our sevral Stations, or the Affairs of humane Life; therefore it will not be amiss to lay down such Conjecturals as may be profitable to some, and pre∣judicial to no good or understanding Protestant; also what may in all likelyhood remarkably fall out in the year 1691. In the beginning of this year Venus is in the Square with Sa∣turn, from whence some notorious Robberies, or such like De∣pridations may be expected; but the Season is not likely to afford any great matter of Action, abroad it being chifly employed in Councils and preparation for Action: and the Square of Jupiter and Mars threaten such as live by violence, rapine, and sinister ways, with due punishment. Soon after we may expect some Action abroad, but of no great moment as yet, and France may
feel the effects of Saturn's being in the point of the Sun's Dire∣ction in that King's Nativity, threatning change or alteration in State Affairs, Mistrust and doubts amongst great Ones, and the Square of Saturn and the Sun threatens Death to some eminent Person. About the beginning of March Mercury gets into the Square of Saturn, so that from thence we may expect to hear some important News from abroad, and great Preparations going for∣ward for the ensuing Campaign, and we may chance to hear of some light Skirmishes between Parties that are scouting abroad on the Frontiers of Allies, or peradventure something notable, or some considerable News from Sea may arrive advantagious for this Kingdom. High Winds are threatned at this time with great Storms, which unluckily prove to the Damage of the Merchants, whose Ships are at Sea, and some Damage may be expected at Land. We find the Planets under the Earth upon the New Moon's be∣ginning in April, also Mars and Venus in the Fourth House, being in Square to Saturn in the Second House, which may unluckily produce some Discontents in restless and uneasie Spirits, and some heats may arise, and yet may either turn to no Account or else to the prejudice of those that soment them: and towards the latter end of the Month good News is promised to England, with a very favourable Prospect of Affairs; and perhaps we may hear of more great Advantages gained in Ireland: however we may not doubt to find a happy agreement and cheerfull Concurrence in our great Councils. And now May coming on, and the Weather fair and whole∣some, we may expect Armies in motion, and some great Action towards. The Turk perhaps may be divested of part of his new Encroachments on the Empire or Imperial Territories and Acquisiions, and the Face of things restored on that side, whilst the French King, who by diverting the Arms of the Empire, has given this opportunity to the Infidels, may be rendered less formi∣dable; and we may about this time expect many flying Stories a∣broad, spread perhaps on purpose to sound the minds and inclina∣tion of the wavering and unsteady, but shall come to nothing in all likelyhood but the shame and disgrace of the spreaders, who may thereby be the more openly exposed and detested, and per∣adventure
punished according to their Demerits. And some Agues or Fevers are feared about this time, but not Epidemical. Many Negotiations are expected about the beginning of June, and the Armies will be in motion, so that we may chance to hear of considerable Action in the Field, and perhaps some strong Place besieged and in distress, and no doubt on our part we shall have a good Account of Affairs, especially in Ireland, where things are expected to go on very prosperously, and the Face of things that have been made ruinous by War and Devastation, will have time to breathe, and recover, so that the Husband-man may ex∣pect in quiet the effects of his Labour, and bring them to a very profitable Market. July promises considerable Action abroad in Countries where the Seat of War is likely to be. Some Violences are threatned this Month, and may in likelyhood be done by private Persons, as Duels, Murthers, &c. whose tragical Effects may turn to the ruine of the Actors. The Tartars may near about this time seem to threaten Poland, or Muscovia, with Inroads, but are likely to have little or no suc∣cess, those very Nations being prepared to receive them, so that we may chance to hear of considerable Action in those parts, as also on those sides where the Turks bend their Forces: Constanti∣nople may seem to be threatned with some Disorders; perhaps such another Insurrection of the Soldiery and Rabble as hap∣pened two years since. Some Commotions likewise are thought to threaten France, by the People's being inwardly disturbed through grievous Taxes and Oppressions; for the New Moon this Tide looks with a threatning Aspect on those Countries under the Tyrannical Scepter of that Arbitrary Monarch. Great Thunders and Lightnings may be expected about this time, and some sudden Storms of Hail, or Rain, to the enda∣magement of Corn that is high grown. In August we may expect some Robberies committed in the Face of the Sun, and others more secretly under the Coverture of Darkness, from the effects of the Square of Saturn; and some People find themselves rest∣less and uneasie, but their fretting proves vain and ridiculous, for the Nation stands generally well affected to baffle and overturn any foolish Projects or Devices that may be raised or conceived,
and Popery still grows to a lower Ebb; so that we may conje∣cture the Incidiary Priests and Jesuits, who have sculked in Cor∣ners, in hopes to raise Commotions, and set us at variance, find∣ing their Harvest blasted, and their Labour fruitless, will be pack∣ing from whence they came, if some of them fall not short by the way: so that Loyalty and Obedience shall take deep root, and flourish, to the Glory of the English Nation, who over and above are blessed with a plentifull Harvest, and the safe Arrival of Merchants richly laden, from divers part of the World. In September expect high Winds, from whose Effects we may probably hear of damages at Sea; but perhaps not considerable: and some Ships taken by Privateers, or Pyrates, and this may be conjectured from the latter Station of Saturn in 23 Degrees of Scorpio; and by that also France is threatned with some great Disorder, and perhaps Scarcity and want of Supplies to carry on her further pernicious Designs; her Treasures being exhausted by a long, unnecessary and vexatious War; and we may happen, though the Season is so far advanced, to hear of some Action ad∣vantagious on our part to the discouragement of our Enemies, and the advancement of our Cause; and what say you, if by this time the Allies have footing in France. In October we may justly expect News from divers parts of the World, of various kinds, and different Subjects; the Lunations considerably affecting Mrcury by Aspect and Position, and in this Month we find him turned Retrograde in opposition to the Moon, and both in square to the place of the last considerable Conjunction in Leo, so that great Storms may be expected, with flouds and over▪ flowings of Rivers in divers places, occasioning harm at Land and Sea; but for the most part look for fair and temperate Weather, sutable to the Season of the year so far ad∣vanced; and the Armies abroad begin to retire into Winter Quar∣ters, after having made considerable Progresses; and England is promised much Tranquility, her Fears being blown evr. In November nothing very considerable can be expected, unless in Councils and Consultations to ripen things for a further oppor∣tunity: ye something more is hinted at by the Stars, but so im∣eectly signified and obscured, that it may be very difficult to make a true Judgement; however according to the Position of
the Aspects, nothing of great moment can happen▪ and what most appears is perhaps▪ some Feuds amongst private Men, which by the Mediation of Friends may come to a friendly reconcile∣ment; and this may be pointed at by Mars his being in Gemini: but as to further Matters nothing extraordinary appears, unless the rise and scarcity of some Commodities brought from forreign parts, made so by Losses at Sea, and the unsecure Passage obstru∣cted by Rovers and Sea-Robbers; however, the Manufacture of England will in all likelyhood make amends, by being increased and improved by the Ingenuity and Industry of its Natives; so that poor People are like to get more Employment than hereto∣fore, to the enabling them to support and maintain their Fami∣lies, without being chargeable to others. December brings in cold Weather, with a likelyhood of Frost and Snow, so that it is a Month wherein no great Action can be expected: though undoubtedly Councils in many State and King∣doms will act under the benign Influence of the auspicious Con∣stellations that point their favourable Rays at us; but the effects of these Councils may not so soon operate: for near this time five of the Planets were in conjunction under the Earth, and four of them soon after in Sagittary, under the Earth likewise, and from these, many Considerations may be drawn of favourable In∣fluence to Governours and Government, and a defeat of Designs that may be laid to make any disturbance, or trouble People that labour to be at quiet; and some Persons who love to be trouble∣some and vexatious may happen to smart for it, if the Royal Cle∣mency interpose not. These are briefly the Considerations of this great and remarkable Year, on which the Eyes of the World are already fixed, as to such Astrological Conjecturals as may in probability come to pass, as to particulars: It now remains that something be said in general. Mny notable Constellations seem to consult, or, as in our more vulgar Phrase, lay their Heads together to promote the In∣terest of these Kingdoms, which we hope God, the great and wise Disposer of all things, will turn to our Advantage; and that we may so improve them, as giving Glory to God for his many Mercies and Favours, he may be pleased to continue his Blessing and Protection towards us, and turn the Devices of our
Enemies into Foolishness: We must with shame and confusion of Face acknowledge that we have sinned against his Mercies and Goodness, though he has not dealt so wonderfully with other Nations as with us, in so great and miraculous Deliverances, when we were upon the brink of Ruine, it was of his Mercy indeed, that we fell not before those that rose up so full of Wrath against us; yet he not only delivered us, and put our Foes to rout and confusion, but he still loads us with Blessing and Success, and commands even the Stars in their Course to fight for us against our Enemies, as they did against Sisera, in the day he visited his People Israel with a mighty Deliverance; yet we must not expect God will do ll for us, unless we make sutable Returns as far as is in our power, by praising and adoring his Holy Name, who is the Author and Giver of all that we enjoy; then shall we pros∣per abroad and at home, our Arms shall be prosperous, and our Foes shall flye before us: Plenty shall fill our Houses and our Stores, and Peace shall be within our Borders; the Influences of Heaven, as second Causes, guided by the first Mover of all things, shall shape their Influences to our Advantage, and every thing shall be propitious and favourable; so that our Enemies percei∣ving the Hand of God against them, shall be weary, and give o∣ver their Enterprizes, or be ashamed of the rebuke Heaven has thrown upon them. Let us then comply with God's Terms for safety and preservation, and then we need not fear what Man can do unto us. This may suffice the Reader, as to these things, and for this memorable Year 1691. FINIS.
