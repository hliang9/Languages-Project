To the Right HONOVRABLE, ROBERT, Lord Bruce, Baron of Byfleet, and onely Sonne to the Right Honourable Thomas, Earle of Elgin. Eleasar Gilbert wisheth all possible Happinesse. Right Honourable, I Have placed you here in the Frontispiece of my Dedicatory, first be∣cause you have a chiefe place in my affections as one whom God hath graced with a more than ordinary portion of his Image, for (to speak without Flattery) what Grace? what Vertue? what endowment, ei∣ther of body, mind, or fortune? Finally, what Perfection or Excel∣lency can make men truly Honourable on Earth, and eternally happy in Heaven, which doth not shine in your Lordship, in the fullest lustre, so farre as your condition and yeares can be capable of? insomuch that if it please the Lord, to addc yeares unto your life, as hee hath gifts unto your person, a starre more radiant then your selfe, I conceive, in our age will scarcely appeare in our Brittish Firmament: moreover, your Lordship may justly challenge the first fruit of my publike la∣bors, because I had the first encouragement tomy ministerial studies in your Honourable Familie, under your Right Honourable, most pious, & never without much Reverence to bee mentioned, Grandmother, Magdalen, Ladie Bruce, where I have beene an eye-witnesse of your vertuous education ab imis, as I may say, incunabulis, from your very infancy, and where I have often observed, the most vigilant and religious care of your Right Honourable Parents, in your vertuous education, which to this day doth most spectably appeare, as a pattern of imitation to all the Nobles in the Land.
Goe on therefore most Noble and hopefull Lord, good luck have you with your Honour, continue that course, in these paths of Vertue, wich you have begun to tread, especially seeing you have already made so good a progresse, for Dimidium facti, qui bene coepit, habet. And you shall find, that although the way bee thorny, yet the end shall be Honourable, that paines which you now take, and have taken to please and serve God, and your right Honourable Parents, shall produce unto you at length, not onely the favour of God, the love of your Soveraign, ōmendation of your equals, & praise of all good men, but also contentment to your mind, peace unto your conscience, pro∣tection to your person, a blessing unto your estate, and a sweet relish to all the houours, wealth, and pleasures which you shall afterwards en∣joy. Which that you may doe, I shall never be wanting in my best devo∣tion, to implore the gracious assistance of that Father of lights, the Watchman of Israel, to double his spirit upon you, and wheresoever you goe, for good to be present with you, to guard you by his Providence, guide you by his counsell, and when he hath here satiated your Lord∣ship with honours and pleasures temporall, bring you at length unto ioyes and happinesse eternall. So prayeth he, who desireth to bee repu∣ted as he is One of your Lordships most ancient and affect onately devoted Servants, Eleazar Gilbert. From my Study in St. Mary-Axe, this 8. Decemb. 1641.
A True Description of the present estate of the Reformed Protestant Churches within the Kingdome of Poland, &c. THe industrious policy, or rather poli∣tick industry of the Roman Clergie, for advancing their cause, and promo∣ting the Papisticall Hierarchy, is as much (if not more commendable) then was that of the injust Steward, Luke 16. 8. did it not crosse the word, or Law of God, (which is the rule of righteousnesse) and breake the bond of charity, which is the complement and perfection of that Law. For what pains doe they not take? How doe they stretch their wits? What Countries peo∣pled, or worthy to be knowne or inhabited, have they not peragrated? to accomplish their designes, and zealous (if I may so call them) devotions. So that if their cause were good, and their laborious in∣deavours to manage that cause guided by a good Spirit, or squared to the rule of Justice, they should certainly be no lesse then that which they call themselves and pretend to be, (namely) The onely true Catholike Church of Christ, that Royall Priesthood, and chosen Generation mentio∣ned by the Apostle Peter. But true wisedome (which is from above) is onely ju∣stified by her children, who doe judge and estimate things, (especially in matters of Religion and Divine worship) not as men value them, but as God esteemeth them, For God seeth not as men see; man oftentimes (by reason of the corruption of his heart, weakenesse of judgement, per∣version
of will, and imperfection of knowledge, and un∣derstanding) may both deceive & be deceived; but so can∣not God, who being all eye, estimateth and knoweth all things perfectly, and essentially, (as they are) as having within himselfe the expresse and true paterne and Ideas of all things that ever have beene, are, or shall be. That therefore men, (I meane onely Christian men who are within the Pale. of Gods Church) may be the better setled and persuaded in the truth of that Religion which they doe professe. It will be most necessary and profitable for them, to take speciall notice of some markes and sym∣ptomes, whereby the true and orthodoxe Religion or Church of Christ may be distinguished and discerned from all false, Antichristian, phanaticall, inventions, tra∣ditions, enthusiasmes, and in a word, from all hereticall, pragmaticall, schismaticall or diabolicall opinions, ima∣ginations, doctrines and professions in the world: which for brevities sake, and that I may sooner come to my in∣tended scope, I will onely at this time name, leaving the more large explication of them unto some other Trea∣rise. 1 The first is the purity, or rather (as I may say) the spirituality of a Religion, as it is cleansed from the drosse of externall ceremonies and exorbitant superstitions, for Almighty God loveth best that Religion or manner of his worship, which is most like himselfe, and agreeable to his word, who being a Spirit, will be worshipped in Spirit and truth, the more therefore that a Religion hath of out∣ward and gaudy Pompes and Ceremonies (to dazle and delude the fancies, eyes, and affections of the ingorant and simple) it is the farther from the nature of God, the more contrary to his will, it hath more drosse, and is the more to be suspected of falshood, and to be Antichristian and idolatrous.
2 Secondly, the more that the grounds, doctrine, di∣scipline & tenets of a Religion, are adverse or to do crosse the corruption of nature, the impurity of mans life and manners, the fulfilling and executing of a mans own exces∣sive lusts and desires, I say, that that Religion is the more like to be orthodoxe and sound, my reason is, because God (being of pure eyes, with whom dwelleth no iniqui∣tie) is a God of order, both inwardly in respect of him∣selfe, and outwardly, in respect of his creatures; inward∣ly, in respect of himselfe, there is a prioritie of order of the Father before the Sonne, of the Sonne before the Holy-Ghost; outwardly, and in respect of the creatures, God made all things in order and measure, yea in such order and measure, that each creature keepeth its owne course and station, (I speake not in regard of corrupted, but created nature) for the mutuall comfort and conservation one of another: the more then that we crosse order and measure, the more I say that wee are excessive and exorbitant in our affections and actions (especially in matters & exercises of Religion and Divine worship) the greater cause have we to suspect our selves, and that Religion which we professe, or which teacheth or warranteth us so to doe; for what is sinne, but an obliquity in our affections and actions, and what is holinesse, or true Religion? but a conformity and rectitude of both these being sutable to Gods revealed will, which is the rule of righteousnesse, that Religion therefore, whose doctrine teacheth us most conformitie and recti∣tude in our affections and actions to Gods word, must of necessity be a true and sound Religion: this is the se∣cond. 3 A third marke of true Religion is, when the doctrins, & practice thereof doe tend more to the advancement of the honour and glory of Christ then our owne worldly or private profit and advantage, and when they doe affect us
with a sense & feeling of our owne wants and unworthi∣nesse, so that we are ready to say (not with the Pharisee, I am not like this man, I have done thus and thus) nor with the Papist, I have performed this worke of condigni∣ty, that of congruity, a third of supererogation, by the working or doing whereof, I have deserved eternall life, both for my selfe and others) but rather confesse with the Apostle, Non sunt condignae, these our momentary suffe∣rings are not worthy of that glory that shall be revealed, and with that good Martyr, onely Christ, onely Christ, or with that worthy Father, Meritum meum miserationes Domini, onely the Lords mercies are my chiefest me∣rits. 4 Fourthly, that is surely a sound and warrantable Religion, wherein most comfort is afforded and mini∣stred to a distressed and perplexed conscience, through the assured confidence of Gods love in our owne Election, especially at the approach of death. For (whereas some false and pretended Religions, for sinistrous and bad ends, teach, that it is great and damnable presumption, to beleeve or be certainely perswaded, that God hath elected us to salvation, or that wee can have in this life any cer∣taine feeling of Gods love in the pardon of our sinnes; True and pure Religion exhorteth us with Saint Peter, to give diligence to make our owne calling and election sure, & no wayes to doubt, but to beleeve, (for he tht doubteth beleeveth not, and maketh God a lyar) to beleeve I say, and be perswaded with Saint Paul, that nothing can separate us from his love, but that Christ shall bee both in life and death our advantage. 5 I could also mention a fifth marke of true Religion, which is this, namely when the principles and doctrines thereof doe not onely teach, but move the professors thereof (although, in respect of persons innumerable, yet
in respect of opinion and affection, to be as one man, when of many hundreds or thousands of men and women that assemble themselves, and enter into the place of Gods worship, the habitation of Gods House, it can be said as it was of these in the Primitive Church , they all entred into the Church, as one man; but because I am to speake more largely of this point about the end of this Treatise, and I am loath that my Citty should, as they say, runne out at the gates, or my preface prove larger then my History; Let these few passages serve to assure the Reader, that such (as is premised) is our Religion, ours, I say, deended and taught in this Angelike Monarchy, the doctrines that wee doe maintaine, the truths that we doe beleeve, and the Cir∣cumstances, which I would at this time commend to the serious observation of all my brethren and Countrie-men, especially to these that are addicted to the Roman Sea, within the Kingdome of Great Britaine or elsewhere, to the effect they may (not onely apprehend and perceive) the true and solid grounds, which our Religion and Church is built upon, which is not the person, or succession of one particulr Peter; but the doctrine and faith of many thou∣sand Pauls, or parvuli Christi, even of all true Christians, who by humility and faith, depend upon the merits of the Sonne of God, and the gracious promises revealed in his word, or inspired Scriptures which were given unto men, not by men, not by any humane tradition or invention, but by Divine inspiration being profitable of themselves, through the working of the Holy-Ghost, to instruct, re∣prove, correct, and make the man of God perfect, wise unto salvation, and furnished unto every good worke; But also behold and know the sandy foundation of the Romish Church, and all other pretended, srothy, hereticall, fan∣tasticall, phanaticall, schismaticall frctious and factious,
Idolatrous and superstitious Religions in the world, which is no other but quircks and tricks of fleshly, worldly and naturall wisedome, not able soundly and savingly, to per∣ceive the things that are of the Spirit of God, yet permit∣ted by God to remaine in his Church, for the correcting, disciplining, and exercising of his militant members, who without such things would freeze to death, and settle them∣selves upon the lees of naturall corruption, and like an Oxe to the slaughter, runne on with others, and precipi∣tate themselves in that broad way that leadeth to destru∣ction. And likewise in the third place, with griefe of heart be∣moane the intollerable pride, insatiable avarice, unlimited ambition, unquenchable malice, hatred and tyrannie, which the Romanists doe exercise, and where-with their chiefe Prelates, Doctors and ghostly Fathers doe burne against their innocent, orthodoxe, and reformed brethren, and whereby they would ingrosse unto themselves, (where∣soever they take footing or beare sway) all power, autho∣rity and priviledges, as well in Civill as Ecclesiasticall affaires, fearing and sparing no lyes, reproaches, calum∣nies, perjuries, murthers, which, either the devils malice, or mans wickednesse can invent, for accomplishing their Politick designes, and Machiavel-like machinations, against all their opposers. The truth whereof wee shall see to appeare plainely, (as in many other parts of Europe, whereof also I suppose, this Kingdome cannot be insensible) so especially in the Kingdome of Poland, aud more particularly in the great Citty of Vilna or the Wilde, the metropolis of Lithuania, a Citty for sumptuous Churches, faire buildings, multi∣tude of people, frequency of commerce, and in a word, aboundance of all good things, (except liberty of con∣science and true Religion) little inferiour to the Citty of
London, being scituated in the heart or center of seven or eight antient Kingdomes, now annexed and allyed to the Crowne of Poland, and namely, Lithuania, Samogitia, Cour∣landia, Livonia, Alba-Russia, Prussia, and Massovia, neere unto which Citty, the Author hereof hath ministred these three yeares last past, to a Congregation of Scots and En∣glish within the Towne of Keydan, which belongeth unto that most famous and Illustrious Prince, and chiefe Pro∣tector of the Reformed Religion, Ianussius Radzivil, Duke of Birz and Dubinka, Prince of the sacred Roman Empire, Lord high Chamberlaine of the great Dukedome of Li∣thuania, Administrator of Mohilovia, Governour of Kasi∣merski, and Kameninski, &c. Who in anno 1638. with the approbation and consent of a Synode holden at the Wilde, received him into the number of his stipendiary Ministers, as appeareth more at length by his Certificate. This great Citty aforesaid, is the Tribunall, or place of Justice for the said great Dukedome of Lithuania, ha∣ving a great University, of almost an innumerous multitude of Students who resort thither for learning, and educa∣tion, especially in the Romish Religion, from all places and corners of the Kingdome, and who doe replenish as it were, or rather pester the whole Citty. There be also therein many Religons professed and tolerated, where∣unto also belong many Churches and places of Divine worship, as a Synagogue to the Jewes, whereof there be many thousands in that Citty; a Ruthenian Church to the Russians; a Mahumetan Church to the Tartatians; a Church to the Lutherans; all which doe enjoy their exer∣cises of Religion without trouble or interruption; These all being (in respect, either of Idolatry, superstition or errours, in league and consanguinity joyned with the Papists) whereof the maine body of that Citty and Kingdome doth consist.
Now amongst the rest, and a little before the decease of the Illustrious Prince Duke Christopher Radzivil, of most honorable and blessed memory, who departed this life in the moneth of August 1640. at his Palace in Vizounez, and was most magnificently buryed at Vizounka twenty miles distant from the aforesaid Citty, in the great Dukedome of Lithuania, upon the twelfth of February last, whereof the Authour was an eye-witnesse; a little I say before his departure, there was also within the aforesaid Citty, a faire, spacious, and strong Church which belonged to the Pro∣testants, whom they call Calvinists, and whose Church by the Romanists is termed in derision by the name of Zbor, or Congregation, whereunto also is adjoyned a Dutch Church, both built of freestone, and environed with a high, strong and thick stone-wall, guarded also with a gar∣rison of Musketiers and Souldiers, whom the aforesaid Prince continually kept in pay for the safety of the said Churches and Professors▪ These two Churches were sci∣tuated within the heart as it were, or middle of the Citty, and were invested with many priviledges and liberties, as any Papist Church in Poland, which were also established and confirmed by many Kings and Parliaments succes∣sively unto these two Churches, (the one Polish, and the other Dutch) belonged three Ministers, the two Polish Ministers were, Master Balthazar Labenski, and Master Yeurski, the Dutch Minister Master Andreas, who were as∣sisted by George Hartibius, Rector of the Protestant Col∣ledge, a man of sound learning, and unspotted conversa∣tion, as appeareth by the testimony of his very adversa∣ries given unto him in divers places. But because these Churches and Ministers, being scitua∣ted as is said, and the Ministers were in great repute, and much frequented by Protestant Noblemen and Gentlemen,
who resorted unto their Sermons in great Assemblies, from all places of the Country, they could not chuse but be a great eye-sore unto their neighbours the Jesuits, Priests, & Fry∣ars, whose Churches, Cloisters, Monasteries & Colledges, were contiguous, and did incompasse them on every side. Behold therefore what hellish tricks and stratagems, these Jesuits▪ Popish Priests and Schollars used for the abolishing of these Churches, and utter suppressing the exercise of the Protestant Religion, and Colledge within the aforesaid Citty. Upon the fifth of October 1639. a certaine Polish Gentleman named Paul Piekarski, with his servant Ioseph Rakouski, being at guest in the house of one Naborowuski, close adjoyning to the Protestant Church, about three of the clocke in the afternoone (amongst other passages and exercises of mirth and jollity) did shoot some Ar∣rowes at a bird or fowle, which they perceived to be upon the top of the steeple of the Protestant Church, two of which Arrowes, (there blowing then much wind) were driven to a Popish Church neere joyning, called Saint Michaels, and lighting at the west end thereof, stucke into the leg of the woodden image of an Angell. Now within the Church-yard of this Church, was and is a great Monastery of Franciscans, some whereof issuing out of their Cloister, perceived these Arrowes sticking in the leg of the image, which being so neere the Protestant Church, and they also so desirous to pick a quarrell against the Protestants, did straight-way conceive and affirme, that these Arrowes were shot out of the Protestant Church by the Evangelick Ministers, or by their appointment, and approbation in despight and contempt of their Romish Religion. The Friars acquainted the Jesuites and Priests therewith, who burning with malice against the Protestants, and daily seeking some occasion to doe them mischiefe, gave order
to their Schollars and Students, to fall upon these hereti∣call Churches, pull them down to the ground, and (if they could) apprehend, or kill these Calvinist Ministers, whom they would needs have to be the authors of that riot; to the performance wherof, these devote and well disciplined Schollars were not slacke, but straightwayes issued out of their Schooles and Colledges like a hive of Bees assisted and accompanied with some thousands of Priests, Prenti∣ses and Serving men who in great furie addressed them∣selves unto the aforesaid Churches, with ladders, shovels, mattoks, and other instruments, beginning to undermine the wall, and uncover the roof of the Protestant Col∣ledge. But there being at that instant (through Gods provi∣dence) many Protestant Noble-men, and Gentlemen with their servants, present at the Christning of one of the Mi∣nisters children, there being also a Garrison of Souldiers, which the aforesaid Duke kept continually in pay for the safeguard of his Churches, the Souldiers and servants let flie a volly or two of shot amongst them, seeing they could not by any faire meanes be removed; this confused Army being hereby terrified, was presently disbanded; and perceiving they could not accomplish their designes against the Protestant Churches, like theeves and Rob∣bers, more then like Christians and Schollars, being led by the Devill their Patron, they betooke themselves to the shops and houses of the Scots, French, and Dutch Merchants there inhabiting, who for the greatest part are Protestants, breaking open their doores, Truncks, and Cupbords, but especially the house & shop of one Iacob de Seans, a French Merchant and Elder of the Protestants Church, from whom they tooke above thirty thousand Florens in goods and money. The day following, Duke Radzivil came to Towne,
who being for the time Viovode or Governour of the Cit∣ty; and being also well informed in the businesse, did first send for, and examine these two Gentlemen formerly men∣tioned, that had shot the Arrowes; who ingenuously con∣fessed in the Tribunall before the Judges, that they did shoot these Arrowes, but not from the Protestant Church, but from the house of one Naborouski where they were at guest, nor did they shoot them at the Popish Church, nor in despight of the Romish Religion, but at a bird or fowle, which was upon the top of the Protestant Church, al∣though contrary to their expectation, they were driven by the wind, as is aforesaid, whereupon they were ready to depose their oath; yet did they hereupon order these two Gentlemen to be committed close prisoners, but the one of them viz. Master Piekarski, escaped and fled into the Countrie. Then did Duke Radzivil deale with the Bishop and the Jesuites, to keepe in and represse their Schollars, least they should breake foorth into some further outrage against the Protestants, this he obtained with much adoe, and letters Patents affixed on all the gates and publick places of the Citty to this purpose. The day following Messengers are disptched away on both sides, with letters informatorie to the Kings Maje∣stie, who was then at Warsovia 80 Polish or Dutch miles distant from the aforesaid Citty, Duke Radzivil giving his majestie to know the true information and state of the businesse, the Papist Bishop againe (whose name was Abrah Voyna or Warre) is very sutable to his nature, exasperating his Majestie by many untruths, reproachfull speeches and blasphemies, which he surmised against the Protestants, but especially their Ministers, (onely to put them out of the favour of the King and fellow-subjects) alledging, though most impudently and falsely, that a little before
the fact of the premisses, viz, the shooting of the Arrowes, these Calvin Heretikes, had most profanely and blasphe∣mously drawne the Crucifixe or picture of our blessed Sa∣viour crucified, by the feet through the streets, as also the Image of the blessed Virgin, spitting upon and dawbing them with dirt and mire, thinking thereby to disgrace the Romish Religion. But the Kings Majestie, suspecting herby the malice of his ghostly Fathers & the iniquity of the cause, gave for the pre∣sent greater credit unto the Duke Radzivils information, and deferred the businesse to the next Parliament, which was held at Warsovia. In the moneth of June following, in the meane time shewing his Princely care for the preserva∣tion of publicke peace, he sendeth diverse letters to the Po∣pish Bishops, but more particularly to the Bishop of Vil∣na the aforesaid Citty, to the Jesuites, Priests, Monaste∣ries and Colledges there, giving them some private checks for their unjust proceedings, and promising unto them the continuance of his Royall favour, and an improve∣ment of their immunities & priviledges, if they would but desist and leave off further prosecuting that busines against Duke Radzivls Churches▪ But that Royall fraternity of Ro∣mish Bishops and Jesuits (being to my thinking) indeed & de facto King of Poland, were the more inflamed and exa∣sperated hereby against the Protestants, and therefore now thinke it high time to muster up all their forces, and strain the quintessence of their deepest wit for accomplishing their designes against them, & providing themselves for the ensuing Parliament, to this purpose they print Libels and Pamphlets against the Protestants, and expose them to be sold in all places of the Kingdome, they send also private∣ly letters informatory to all the Popish Bishops, Noble∣men and Judges of the Land, who were all addicted to the Roman Sea, and to be present and chiefest members of
the ensuing Parliament, aggravating by many odious cir∣cumstances, how much and how farre the Calvin hereticks and their Preachers were troublers of the peace of the Kingdome, and what wicked and blasphemous insolencies had beene lately practised by them in disgrace and con∣tempt of their Catholicke Church. The Parliament is set, and Committees on both sides appointed for hearing and concluding the businesse: upon the Protestant side, were the Illustrious Duke Radzivil aforesaid, Lord Grozewski, Lord Rey, Lord Cocholewski, and some others, all men of admirable learning, eloquence, judgement, and integrity, who did so truly, plainely, pun∣ctually, and in such orientall colours display the case, and discover, these insupportable, insupposable, and un∣heard of injuries practised by the Roman Clergie against them, their brethren, Churches, lands, and inheritances, contrary to the Kings Majestie his oath, (who at his Co∣ronation is solemnly sworne to maintaine the peace and liberty of the Protestants as well as of the Papists) to the Lawes of the Land, acts of Parliament, and practise of other Nations, that many of the honest Popish Bishops & Noblemen were moved to teares and to commiserate the distresse of the said Illustrious Duke his Churches & bre∣thren; but the maine body of the Parliament being all Pa∣pists, and rigidly addicted to the Roman Sea, and conse∣quently maliciously bent against the Protestant cause, did confederate and bnd themselves together, against the said Duke and the other Protestants Lords, commanding him to bee silent, and not to proceed any further in defen∣ding so bd a cause, alledging, that they had witnesses suffi∣cient against them, and that the aforesaid Illustrious Duke, spoke too well for a bad businesse, and was more fit to be an Atturney then a Prince. Duke Radzivil seeing his just cause like to be overwhel∣med
by the malevolent censures of a partiall multitude; went to take his leave of the King, and to informe his Ma∣jestie of their false and injurious proceedings against him; but no sooner was he entred into conference with his Ma∣jestie in his Bed-chamber, the doores being shut, but straightway followed three Popish Bishops, viz. the Bi∣shop of Cracovia, the Bishop of Loobleen, and the Bishop of Thoren, who fearing that Duke Radzivil by his speech with his Majestie should obtaine some favour to prevent their purposes (more like temporall Monarchs and Em∣perours) then spirituall or Ecclesiasticall Prelats, did boldly and rudely knocke at the doore, perswading or ra∣ther threatning his Majestie to forsake the discourse and company of Duke Radzivil, and to goe along with them, there being at that instant some urgent businesse which re∣quired his presence in the Parliament. The day following, his Majestie sent for the Duke to dinner, but hee being ready upon his journey refused to come, and about two or three of the clocke in the after∣noone (admiring the injustice and ingratitude of that peo∣ple for whom hee had done so many great services, with much griefe and discontentment departed the Citty. Immediatly after his departure his Majestie being over∣swayed by the Popish Prelates and Clergy men,, gave out this sentence and Decree against Duke Radzivils Chur∣ches and Ministers, the tenor whereof followeth. Quandoquidem inquisit to legitime est peracta, ex qua eviden∣ter, de delicto & loco delicti constat, Quod nimirum ex coetu Evangelicorum sagittae ad frontispicium Templi Sancti Michae∣lis, fuerint emissae; Ideo Sacr. Regia Majestas discernit Monia∣les ad convincendum, adversa parte potiores esse: quam convictio∣nem, ut ejusmodi Monasterii Antistita cum septem monialibus, ex eodem Monasterio, juramentum super personas in mandato speci∣ficatas (quas ipsa sibi elegerit Vilnae, in Tribunali comositi
judicii, a data hujus decreti hodierna, post octo septimanas, juxta formulam juramenti ex Cancellaria nostra Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae extraditam expediant mandamus, depoenis infligen∣dis, Sacr. Reg. Majestas deliberat. In English thus, For as much as after due examination, there is found a clere evidence touching this fact, and the place where it was committed; namely that Arrowes were shot from the Protestant Congregation, at the Frontispice or fore∣part of Saint Michaels Church, therefore the Kings sacred Majestie approving the cause of the Nunnes to be more just and legall, then that of the Protestants, doth com∣mand and charge the Prioresse of that same Cloister with seven Nunnes more of the same Monasterie, to appeare in the Citty of Vilna, eight weekes after the date hereof, and there take their corporall oath before the set Bench against these parties that are convicted, and specified in the Man∣dat, or against so many of them as they shall thinke fitting, according to the oath used in this nature drawne out of our Chancery Office of the great Dukedome of Lithuania, the punishment to be determined by the Kings Majestie. Expeditio deliberationis, ejusdem Anni die facta Maii, 26. The execution of his Majesties censure touching the delinquent, passed in the same yeare the 26 of May, In this manner. Sacra Regia Majestas expediendo deliberationem mandat, ut personae quas Moniales convincent, subsint poeais legum, quarum executionem quilibet Magistratus sub poenis de negligentibus officialibus sancitis, statim post executionem exequi debet, Et quandoquidem constat situm Ecclesiae Evangelicae, inter Templa Romano-Catholica occasionem tam praeteritorum quam praesentiii excessuum dedisse, & vero S. Reg, M. ratione juramenti sui regii, obligatasit praescindere omnes occasines, turbandae nedil violandae pacis inter dissidntes de Religi S. Rg. M. decreti hujus
vigore Vniversum exercitium Religionis dissidentium, (tam pu∣blicum quam privatum) in perpetuum ex isto loco removet, ac ipsum etiam nomen Zbor, coetus, Consimilem in modum Scholas, & Xenodochia, convertendo illas structuras & areas, in aedes, & fundum mere privatum, & possessionem ejus in totum reser∣vando illi vel illis quibus de jure competierit, sine ullo, (vel pri∣vatissimo dissidentium exercitio; & haec omnia expediri debent intra spatium & septimanarum post convictionem sub poena infa∣miae, & sub eadem, neque in alio quoquam loco (intra Regiae Civitatis Vilnensis maenia) tam publicum quam privatum ejusdem Religionis excercitium, sub ullo unquam praetextu resuscitabunt. Similiter nec Scholam, nec Xenodochium praesentis decreti vigore, exceptis his qui peregre advenient, juxta sensum confoederationis. Interim tamen, dissidentes in hortum sepulturis destinatum, exercitium hoc suum transferre poterunt, sub ejusdem confoede∣rationis securitate. Huic decreto ad majorem rei fidem Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae sigillum appensum est. Datum Warsoviae in comitiis Regni 26 Maii 1640. Thus Englished. The Kings sacred Majestie, in the declaration of his De∣cree, doth command & charge, that these persons that shall be convicted by the Nuns, be liable to the punishment of the Law, which every Magistrate whom it doth concerne, presently after their conviction, shall execute under paine of contempt. And for as much as the scituation of the Protestant Church, (being amongst the Roman Catho∣licks Churches) hath given occasion, not onely of this, but also of many former ryots, and likewise the Kings Majesty is by his Royall oath obliged to prevent, & cut off all occasions, that may either disturbe, or breake the peace of his subject in point of Religion; His Majestie there∣fore, by vertue of this Decree, doth altogether prohibite and abolish all kind of exercise of the Protestant Religion, as well private as publicke, from that place for ever; as
also the names Zbor, or Congregation, their Schooles likewise and Alme-houses, changing the yards and buildings thereof into dwelling houses or private ground, reserving the possession thereof, to such to whom they doe lawfully appertaine; and this shall be performed within six weekes after the conviction, under paine of infamy, nor shall the aforesaid Protestants (under the aforesaid penalty) ever have or stirre up exercise or use of their Religion, Schoole, or Hospitall within the walls of the Regall Cit∣ty of the Wilde, strangers and Travellers excepted, that are confederate with us; howsoever they shall have toleration and licence (in respect of the league aforesaid) and no otherwise, to have the exercises of their Religion in their buriall place, for the further ratification whereof this present Decree is given under the Seale of the Great Duke∣dome of Lithuania, Dated in the Parliament at VVarso, 26 Maii 1640. This Decree of his Majestie was seconded by an oath which seven Nunnes, (suborned by the aforesaid Bishop and Jesuites) made at the Wilde 21 July 1640. We A. B. C. D, &c. Doe sweare by the holy Trinity, that by the knowledge or approbation of the Protestant Ministers and guests, dwelling with them, arrowes were shot out of a Bow from the Protestant Church, in dis∣grace and contempt of the Roman Catholicke Church, but especially by one Iohn Yeurski, who at that time had a child christned, also by Balthasar Labenski, the eldest Mi∣nister of that Congregation, and George Hartlibius Rector of their Colledge who all (dwelling within the walls of the aforesaid Church) doe better know, and can tell the names of the other delinquents, but that this our oath, which we take against these men, as the principall authors of that fact is true and lawfull, so helpe us God and his holy Evangell.
Now by the way, and before I goe any further, let me beseech the Reader to observe a wonderfull expression of Gods Justice, for within some few houres after this oath was taken, one of these perjured Nunnes was suddenly stroken with death, and fell downe dead before she could recover her owne Cloister. And that this oath which these Nunnes tooke, was no∣toriously false, doth appeare evidently by the contrary oath of the two above named Gentlemen, Paul Piekarski, and Ioseph Rakowski, who not long after, in the City of Novogard, swore before the whole Tribunall or Bench, that they and none other were the men that shot these Ar∣rowes, and that the Protestant Ministers were cleare of that fact; neither knew any thing thereof, nor were they shot from their Church, but from the dwelling house of one Naborowski, nor did they any wayes ayme at the Papist Church to disgrace that Religion, but in sport and merri∣ment, they shot at a bird which was upon the top of the Protestant Church, although (contrary to their expecta∣tion) their Arrowes were driven aside by the wind: yet behold, good Reader, what a great fire a small sparkle kin∣dleth, what a great mischiefe did insue upon so small oc∣casion; For that nothing might bee wanting to expresse the fury and malice of the Romish Prelate of the VVild and Jesuites, against their innocent and harmelesse brethren, (Although they knew their cause to be unjust, and the oath which the Nunnes had taken to be false, yet did they proceed to irritate and exasperate the Judges to execute the Sentence, according to the former Decree, which in the moneth of Aprill 1641. followed in this manner, viz. That for as much as the parties convicted, were not only guilty of the aforesaid ryot as turbulet persons, and breakers of the peace of the Kingdome, but also by their
hereticall preaching, disputations and conferences, did seduce and draw away many from the Catholicke faith, that therefore they esteemed them guilty of death, yea more worthy of punishment, then the most wicked male∣factors. It is therefore sentenced by this honorable Bench, that the delinquents shall be taken to the market place of the City of Vilna, the City where the fact was committed, and there be executed publickly as Traitors to his Maje∣stie, and troublers of the publicke peace (the manner of their death to be left to his Majesties pleasure) their lands and goods to be confiscated to the use of his Majestie or Assignes. Item, that the exercises of the Protestant Religion, shall altogether cease and be suppressed within the walls of the Royall Citty of Vilna, and that the Churches where these exercises were had, shall bee converted altogether into dwelling houses, or to some other civill use, and that upon no pretext or cause whatsoever, there shall be preaching in that place, or any where else within the said Gity, under the penalties formerly mentioned. The Illustrious Duke Radzivil, perceiving the injustice, malice, and cruelty of these Romanists, and condoling the estate of his distressed servants and Ministers, a little be∣fore the publication of the Sentence, about midnight, sent for them to his Palace, where after some houres private conference, he wrote letters commendatory to the Duke of Prusia, and having furnished them with money, and a guard of a hundred Tartarian horsemen, they were con∣veyed to the Town of Keydan; from whence within 2 or 3 dayes after they departed to the Tilz, from thence to the first great Castle & Town in Prusia, belonging to the Duke of Prusia, from whence shortly after the death of the Illustri∣ous old Duke Radzivil, and the Duke of Brandeburgh, this
Duke of Prusia his father, who both dyed in one moneth, viz. in the moneth of August 1640; fearing further per∣secution, they were removed to the Towne of Memble, a great strength upon the Sea side under the Duke of Prusia, nor long after unto Konisberg, and at length unto Dantsk, where they remaine unto this day, being banished from their places, Countries and families, without mainte∣nance, and separated from all hope of future reliefe, unlesse the Lord worke it by the charitable care and affection of their reformed brethren, as appeareth more fully, by that most unjust Decree of proscription, since published against them, the coppy whereof shall God willing be im∣parted to the Reader. Neither can I omit in this Historicall Relation, that barbarous cruelty of the Jesuites Scollars in the Wilde, in the day of the aforesaid tumult, against that good man Master George Hartlib Rector of the Protestant Colledge, a man for learning, innocence and integrity, famous and excellent, yea, the Popish Bishop of the VVilde, his great enemy, in a publicke meeting, did not onely acknowledge his worthinesse, but also with great griefe, (although it was too late) condole his distresse more then any of the others. Moreover one of these Jesuites, travelling lately through Dantsk into Germanie, did confesse, that hee was innocent, and the reason why he was condemned and pro∣scribed since, was no otther, but that hee disputed in pu∣blicke against the Popish Religion, and seduced the No∣bility and Gentry committed to his trust; in which re∣gard they esteemed him to be more worthy of punishment then any malefactor. This good man, I say, walking peaceably from the Protestant Colledge unto his owne house, was by these Catholicke Christian Schollars, ap∣prehended as a thiefe, beaten with trees, buffered, and most dangerously wounded with stones in foure or five places
of the head: not contented with this, as if it had beene too gentle a punishment, they threw him over a bridge into a deep river, from whence (having once escape) they threw him in againe, & at last perceiving that hee had escaped the second time, and that they could not thereby take away his life, they followeth him into a Bathstove or hothouse, where some pittifull-hearted men and women, (although Papists) commiserating his condition, had sheltered him, and assaulted his life, and those that tooke his part, with most inhumane and diabolicall fury, but he being hidden by a good old woman under a washing tub, continued there untill midnight, and at last, taking upon him the ha∣bit of that woman, by Gods providence he escaped their outrage. Moreover (as if these things were too little to expresse their insolencies against the Evangelick Protestants) they have proceeded further, and that by the same aforesaid meanes, namely by cavils, tricks of Law and perjury, to abolish and take away all the Protestant or Evangelick Churches, that were and are within the Kings Regall Townes and chiefest Citties throughout the whole Realme of Poland, such as were the Church of Krakovia, Posenania, Looblene, Sendomerzee, Polocia, Bresta, all great and Regall Townes and chiefest Citties of the Kingdome, besides that of the VVilde, formerly mentioned. So that now there re∣maine no more Protestants Churches throughout the whole Kingdome of Poland, except two in the Citty of Dantsk, & the Duke of Brandeburg Church in his Konisbergh, called the Sole, & so it may well indeed, for there is no more in all the Citty of Konisbergh, and the Lutherians will suf∣fer no more, but the Church of Vitepsia, the Church of Minski, the Church of Novoguard and the Church of Ro∣seyn, all which also the Popish Jesuites and Priests are daily plodding to take away. So that unles it please the Lord to use
some meanes to prevent their Jesuiticall enterprises, the whole number of Protestant Churches, and consequently the whole publicke exercise of our reformed Religion, throughout the whole Kingdome of Poland within few yeares, is like to be extirpated and extinguished. To conclude, of late and since the death of our Illustri∣ous Patron Duke Christophe Radzivil formerly mentioned, the pride and insolency of Jesuites and Papists is growne to such a heigth, that they spare not to persecute and as∣sault our Ministers and Professors in the open streets, af∣fronting them with opprobrious speeches, and sometimes with blowes, yea, often wounding them with gunnes, sha∣bles, clubs or stones, as they lately did two of our Dukes Ministers in the Wilde, about the moneth of December last (one whereof, a learned and Reverend Divine) Master Iacobus, they afflicted with three severall wounds, one in the arme, another in the left cheeke, and a third on the backe of the left hand, whereof I my selfe was an eye-witnesse, so that they are now forced to forsake their Ministeriall ha∣bits, and goe like Merchants or Souldiers, with coloured clothes and weapons. The truth whereof, I my selfe have lately experienced, having beene two severall times in great danger of my life, once, namely about the latter end of February last, travel∣ling peaceably in my sled, from Keydan the place of my re∣sidence, unto Rogola, which is foure Polish miles distant, I was set upon in the high-way by a Polish Boyarne or Gentleman, who asked me what Bishop I served under, but because I could not answer him in his owne language so well as he expected, or perhaps, by my habit, surmised me to be one of Duke Radzivils Ministers, stroke at me most desperatly with his shble or Polish sword three or foure severall times, wounded me in the head, and had I not warded two or three of his blowes, with a thick Cane,
which I then had in mine hand, and which he did almost cut through, he had certainely bereft me of my life. Not long after, being in the Towne of Kowan six Polish miles from Keydan, walking in the streets about nine of the clocke in the morning, going to buy some necessaries, because I saluted not the Crucifix, which was then car∣ryed by me in procession, and encountred me unawares; the Jesuite Schollars accompanyed with two Capushine Fryars fell upon me, and assaulted me so fiercely, first with words, and then with blowes and stones, that I was forced to make more then ordinary haste to my lod∣ging. Thus have I discharged my duty to my Illustrious Pa∣tron, discovered unto you the afflicted estate of our re∣formed Churches under the Crowne of Poland, and expo∣sed to the world, the treacherous practices, malicious tyrannie, unreconciliable hatred, unlimited and unsatia∣ble ambition of the Romish Prelats and their associates within the aforesaid Kingdome. And yet I would not hereby absolutely and totally con∣demne the Romish Church (as it is a Church, and a part or member, although a diseased and rotten one) of the true Catholicke Church of Christ, and as it beleeveth, approveth and maintaineth with Christs Apostles and us, many essentiall and Orthodoxe points of truth, both in doctrine and discipline, agreeable to the word of God and the analogy of fith. Nor would I discourage too much the modest and better sort of Papists, who living in simple ignorance, make innocencie and charity, the touchstone of their Religion. For I am very confident, that he that cannot try the truth of his Religion by these two, let him be Protestant or Papist, or of whatsoever other Religion he will, all that he beleeveth, knoweth or professeth of that Religion cannot profit him to salvation
but is as founding brasse, or a tinckling Cymball, because the faith or knowledge which he professeth or pretendeth to have, is meerely notionall and speculative, residing onely in the braine, and shewing it selfe onely by words or outward posture, but not inwardly affecting or hea∣ting the heart, with a desire to doe good, or frame our actions according to our profession. For that Religion that must save us, must be a practicall Religion, that faith that must justifie us before God, must be an effectuall ope∣rative faith, which worketh by love, and that knowledge of God and of his Sonne Christ, that knowledge, I say, of Religion, and Divine worship, which is true and able to doe us good, and bring us to life eternall, must bee such a knowledge, saith Pet. Mart. Quia ita mutamur, ut quae scimus, opere conemur exprimere, P. M. inloe. com, otherwise, the better our Religion is, and the more that we know of it, or are leaned in it, it will be the worse for us, for Poten∣tes potenter torquebuntur, that swimming learning or know∣ledge which we have, will but aggravate our condemna∣tion, for according to our talent of knowledge, doth God expect from us a correspondent reckoning of obe∣dience, whereas he doth not so to such unto whom he hath not shewed himselfe so bountifull a Creditor. But first, I would hereby admonish and give notice unto all the simpler and more ignorant sort of Papists, who either have beene lately seduced by these Romish impo∣stures, or have not as yet taken deepe footing, and are but newly entred into that Antichristian Laborynth, that they would in time, and before they passe too farre, retire and withdraw themselves, least in the end, they provoke the Lord to complaine of them as he did of those in the fourth Psalme, O yee sonnes of men, how long will you follow after vanities and seeke after leasings? Secondly, I would hereby bewayle and condemne Cras∣sam
illam, & supinam Pontificiorum ignorantiam, that most grosse, or rather wilfull and obstinate ignorance of the Roman Prelates and Church-men, who I am perswaded in my conscience, beleeve in their hearts, know with their understanding, discerne by their judgement, although they will not confesse with their mouthes, most, if not all of these, humane inventions, unnecessary traditions, idola∣trous superstitions, false, cruell, treacherous and ungodly practices, doctrines, devices and machinations, wherein they differ from us, and from that truly antient, Catho∣licke and Apostolike doctrine, professed and beleeved in the purer times of the Church, many hundred yeares be∣fore ever there was the least mention of the Popes holi∣nesse, and by Gods grace, is continued, beleeved, and maintained by us in this Angel-like Monarchy, I say, it is not possible, but that they must needs know these things which they teach, write, professe, and maintaine, for the grounds of their Religion, and maintaining, improving, and advancing of their Hierarchy to be unjust, false, un∣christian and hereticall, and blasphemous: did they not (by reason of that Regnum ignorantiae & erroris) that is, of that kingdome of ignorance that is amongst them, shut up the gates of truth, that is, of holy Scriptures, (which is the rule and ground of truth) from themselves and their people. Haeretici Sacerdotes claudunt Ianuam veritatis, the hereticall Priests shut the gates of truth, because they know, that if the truth were knowne, their Religion should be forsaken, and they cast downe and debased from their Pontificall dignity, into the meane condition of ordina∣ry people, yea, I should rather have said, did not the Prince of this world, which ruleth in the hearts of the children of disobedience shut their eyes that they should not see, stop their eares, that they cannot heare, harden their hearts, that they should not understand nor discerne
the wayes of truth wherein they should walke, and there∣fore it is no marvell, that God hath given them over, to a reprobate sense, to be like other Sectaries and heretiks, obstinate in their errors, to beleeve strong delusions, and to hold the truth in unrighteousnesse. Thirdly, I would hereby incourage my Brethren and Country-men, whether in this Kingdome or else-where, to stand firme and constant in the truth of their profession, and not to be moved and-shaken with every winde of doctrine; nor by their Sects, Schismes, separations, pri∣vate and confused opinions or Assemblies, rend the unseamed Coat of their Redeemer, or thereby teare that part of his mysticall body, which hee doth graciously please to continue in this Kingdome, but to agree rather in one consent to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace to follow after peace with all men, and ho∣linesse, yea to forbeare one another in love, and to follow after the truth in love, with peaceable and loving affections, not with hot and furious distempers, as some of us seeme to doe, who thinke they cannot be religious enough, un∣lesse they be enemies to peace, and that there can be no better patterne of wholesome doctrine, to hold fast, keep, and frame their faith by, then that which is of their owne weaving. I tell you (good Brethren) this patterne of do∣ctrine, which is maintained, and I hope shall be maintai∣ned in these Kingdomes, is good enough, yea so good, that I know none in the world better (and I am sure I have read, heard, knowne and seene as much of the world, almost, as any other of my Coate and calling within this Iland) yea, I say, there is none so good, none so neare that patterne which Paul commended to Timothie, therefore keep it fast, which you cannot doe unlesse you love the truth and peace. Say not one of you, I am of Paul, another I am of Apollos, a third, I am of Cephas, a fourth, I am of Christ:
Let me intreat you (for Christ his sake) not to deceive your selves, for Christ neither will not can be divided, nor will he ever send his Spirit into you, to illuminate or inspire you with the truth, if hee see you inclined or ad∣dicted to schisme or faction, for in malevolam animam non introibit sapientia, Heavenly wisedome and truth, will not enter into soules, that through fraction; contention, schisme, or separation, are divided and dissipated, Vna est Columba mea, saith Christ of his Spouse the Church, My Dove is one, and as his Church is one, so is his Spi∣rit, which once descended upon him in the likenesse of a Dove, to teach all posterities, that he will never send his graces, but into dove-like soules, that is, into men and women, that are of a dove-like, innocent, humble and loving heart. Certainely that knowledge which they have or professe of Gods worship (that are otherwise) cannot be true and good, it cannot I say, be true, unlesse it make them one with their brethren, as Christ is one with the Father, Iohn 17. 20. Be not therefore divided, give not the Papists occasion to say, (as I have heard some of them lately say to my selfe) The Protestants have so many Sects amongst them, that they know not what to embrace, nay said one, there are in this City (for the present) above ninety severall Reli∣gions, each one differing from another, nay each one de∣spising, excommunicating and separating themselves from other. O let not this be heard in Gath, nor published in the streets of Askalon: For shame, for shame, give not this occasion to the adversary, forsake not Christs Spouse for her blacke spots, nor his true Reformed Church in this Land for her imperfections: what? would you have a Church Militant, to be Triumphant? or doe you dreame of, or seeke for a Church in this life that hath no blemish? such men as these had best buy
wings to themselves and flee beyond the Moone to the gar∣den of Hesperide, wherein (some say) was Paradise, and which (if wee will beleeve Poets) is altogether free from stormes and tempests, sure I am beneath the Moone, there is no man, no Religion, no Church free from blemishes, nor possibly can be. Seeing that of the Apostle is as true of all the Church, as of one of the Church, here we see darkely through a glasse, we know but in part, but then we shall know as we are knowne; 1 Cor. 13. 12. Let us not say, in matters of Religion, draw backwardly or contrari∣wayes like Sampsons Foxes, that were bound together tayle to tayle, for then can follow nothing but jars, contention, combustion and tumultuous confusion, but let us be rather like the Cherubins, having our faces looking one towards another, that is, let us all with one consent and unity of mind, especially in matters of faith and Religion, joyne together in love, opinion, judgement, and affection, to embrace, beleeve, and practice such a forme of doctrine, discipline and government, as hath been ever since Christ, or at the least, in the purer times after Christ received and followed in the Christian Church, and as I hope (through Gods goodnesse and providence, shall shortly be establi∣shed in this Kingdome, by the religious care and wise∣dome of our King and Parliament; which I am perswaded will be no other then such as shall be most pleasing unto God, justifiable and harmelesse to the people, sutable to the Scriptures, and most approveable and comfortable to mens consciences. Such, I say, as shall have for their ground and warrant, not mens inventions, humane po∣licy and traditions, but absolutely and immediatly Gods inspired Scriptures, which are sufficient, in all things to instruct, reprove, correct in righteousnesse, and to make the man of God perfect, furnished throughly to every good work; in a word, such as shall most conduce for the
advancement of Gods glory, and depressing the pride and ambition of mens hearts, such as are most contrary to the corruption of mans life & manners, such as are most spiritu∣all & sutable to the nature of God, who is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in spirit & truth: finally such as can afford most comfort and ease, unto troubled and perplexed con∣sciences; if, I say, such doctrines, discipline, and manner of Government be admitted & established in our Church, (as I make no doubt they shall) and also if all the people from Dan to Beersheba, both in City and Country, from all places, and corners of the Land, joyne together, as is aforesaid, without contention, preposterous zeale, schisme, and separation; to approve, beleeve, receive and practice the same, then shall our Church, like Aarons rod, flourish to all possible perfection, even to the astonishment and admiration of all her enemies, being as Mount Sion which cannot be removed, but remaineth for ever: as the moun∣taines about Ierusalem, so shall the Lord be about his peo∣ple from henceforth, and for ever, Psa. 150. Fourthly and lastly, let these and such like treacherous practices of Jesuites and Papists abovementioned, be a foelix quem faciunt, or warning-peale unto all the Ortho∣doxe and Reformed Churches in the world, to make them (not only hate and abhorre all Popish and Antichristian devices, but also abandon (if they wish their owne wel∣fare) and (as much as is possible) exterminate and extir∣pate out of their Lands and Kingdomes, all pragmaticall and busie heded Romanists, but especially these of the Jesuited sort, which are more rigidly devoted and addi∣cted to the Roman Sea. Let this Historie, I say, be as wormwood to the dug, to make the Sons of our Mother, the children of this Church, forsake the paps of that An∣tichristian whore, and not to admit upon any termes, much lesse to approve, or maintaine the least semblance
of a Papisticall Hierarchie, least (if they doe) their ghost∣ly fathers, Prelates and Fraternities shew them a tricke of Machiavelisme, and how doggetly they can insult and do∣mineere over their simple and Reformed Brethren, wherso∣ever they take footing, as they have lately done these two yeares past in the Kingdom of Poland, over that famous Il∣lustrious and Orthodoxe Prince Duke Christopher Radzivil, the father, and his distressed Ministers, and are like to do still over his most excellent and Illustrious sonne, Prince Ianussius, unlesse the Lord provide some remedy to the contrary. But especially, let them take notice of this unto whom both God and his Anointed our Soveraigne, hath free∣ly and graciously granted all sort of power, right, Law, and prerogative to execute, establish and reforme matters tending to the preservation and welfare of this Kingdome, for whom (as true and naturall sonnes of this Sion) let us be carefull in our best devotion and prayers to sollicite and implore the favourable assistance, and gracious pre∣sence of the Almighty, who hath the hearts of Kings and great men in his hands, turning them (like the rivers of water) which way he listeth; That he may be pleased so to affect and dispose the hearts of the Peeres and Princes, Magistrates of this Land, that they may speedily bethinke themselves of some opportune way and meanes, whereby all fractions, and factions, schismes, separations, sidings, and backslidings, contentions, combustions, confusions, prevarications, finally all Antichristian, polypragmati∣call, tyrannicall, and treacherous heresies, schismes, pra∣ctices, professions, and enterprises may be quite, or at least as much as is possible, abolished and removed from the body and bounds of this Monarchie, and that all his Ma∣jesties subjects here and elsewhere, may from henceforth concurre and consent, in unity of mind, opinion, judg∣ment,
conscience, and affection, to embrace, professe, maintaine, retaine, beleeve and Practice such a platforme and patterne of wholesome doctrine and Religion, as is most consonant and agreeable to Gods revealed will, loving the truth and peace, and following after the truth in love; in a word, if it be possible, and as much as in them lyeth, following peace with all men and holinesse, that there may be amongst them all, but one body and one spirit, even as they are called in one hope of their vocation, one Lord, one faith, one Baptisme, one God and Father of them all, in them all, and through them all, Amen.
