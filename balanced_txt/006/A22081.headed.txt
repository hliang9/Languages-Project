❧ By the King. ¶ A Proclamation against the vttering of light Spanish Siluer Coine. WHereas the Spanish Siluer Moneyes (which heretofore were good and of full waight, and went in payments by toleration without preiudice, or rather to the benefite of Trade within this Realme,) are now of late in a maner generally so clipped and impaired, That in the payment thereof, the losse is most com∣monly (to the Receiuer) no lesse then a full third part; And whereas there is dayly brought from forraine Countreis into diuers parts of this Kingdome, an exceeding great quantitie of the said light Spanish Moneyes, by reason that the gaine thereupon is so excessiue; which Moneyes (being here mixed amongst his Maiesties proper Coyne,) are passed away at the very full value that they were to beare, if they were not defectiue as aforesaid: which abuse doeth so farre impouerish the Receiuers, (being, for the most part, of the poorer sort,) and doeth breed such a generall contention, and disturbance betwixt the Buyer and Seller, and the Creditour and Debtour, as (if the same should be long endured) it would breed an in∣tollerable inconuenience. His Maiestie therefore being sensible of the least grieuance of His louing Subiects, much more of a case so much concerning their good, and His owne Honour, Doeth by these presents straitly forbid and prohibite, that any Spanish Mo∣neyes of Siluer that are clipped, or otherwise abated of their true and originall Values, shall be vttered and payed, or accepted and receiued by way of payment within any His Ma∣iesties Dominions, vpon paine of Fine, and imprisonment to be inflicted and adiudged by His Highnesse Court of Star-chamber, or otherwise course of Law. And doeth further command, That such defectiue Spanish Moneys be with all conuenient expedition brought into his Highnesse Mint in the Lower of London, to be coyned of new into currant Mo∣neyes of this Realme, where the Owners shall receiue present payment for same, accor∣ding to their true waight and values in Bullion. Giuen at our Palace of Westminster the twentieth day of May, in the eleuenth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO 1613.
