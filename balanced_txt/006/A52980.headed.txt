A New SONG. Being a SECOND PART to the same Tune of Lillibullero, &c. A Treaty's on foot, look about English Boys, Stop a Bad Peace as soon as you can; A Peace, which our Hanover's Title destroys, And shakes the high Throne of Our Glorious Queen ANNE. Over, over, Hanover, over, Haste and assist our Queen and our State; Hast over, Hanover, fast as you can over; Put in your Claim, before 'tis too late. A Bargain our Queen made with her good Friends, The States, to uphold the Protestant Line; If a Bad Peace is made, that Bargain then ends, And spoils Her good Majesty's gallant Design. Over, over, &c. A Creature there is, that goes by more Names Than ever an honest Man could, shou'd or wou'd; And I wish we don't find him an arrant King James, Whene'er he peeps out from under his Hood. Over, over, &c. The Dauphin of France to a Monastry went To visit the Mother of him aforesaid; He wish'd her much Joy, and he left her Content With a dainty fine Peace about to be made. Over, over, &c. What kind of a Peace, I think we may guess, So welcome must be to her and her Lad: And let any Man say it, if we can do less Than be very sorry, when they're very glad. Over, over, &c. Whoe'er is in Place, I care not a fig; Nor will I decide 'twixt High-Church and Low: 'Tis now no Dispute between Tory and Whig, But whether a Popish Successor, or No. Over, over, &c. Our Honest Allies this Peace does explain, Of which our French Foes so loudly do boast; But I hope, if they reckon on India and Spain, They reckon without consulting their Host. Over, over, &c. Or else we must bid farewel to our Trade, Whatever fine Tales some People have told; For whene'er a Peace of that Nature is made, We shall send out no Wool, nor bring home no Gold. Over, over, &c. Then wage on the War, Boys, with all your Might, Our Taxes are great, but our Danger's not small; We'd better be half Undone, than be quite; As half a Loaf's better than no Bread at all. Over, over, &c. FINIS.
