This is Lights appearance in the Truth to all the precious dear Lambs of the Life Dark vanished, Light shines forth: Set forth by Sarah Iones. DEar Lambs, whom the Father hath visited with his eternal love, this is the Message of the Lord unto you from that word which shall endure for ever, that ye sink down into that eternal word, and rest there, and not in any manifestations, that proceeds from the word, for it is the word of the Lord once more mentioned, that shall endure for ever, and those that are gathered into it; and so dear babes, this is the testimonie of the Fathers love, that ye may not rest short of himself through, one who the Lord God hath brought, and is a bringing to the loss of all things, that I may be found in him; which eternal word was before manifesta∣tions were, and this is the word that the builder refuses, which is become the head of the corner. Dear babes, read and tell me within, for those that build upon the manifestations, and not upon that that manifests, sets up an Idol in the heart, which the Lord God will shortly throw down: Dear babes, not that the manifestation from the Spirit of truth is denyed, for whatsoever is manifested or revealed to the Creature, it is to lead it to the substance, and so that soul and spirit that sinks down into it, it works and levens into its own creature, and it will work out the nature which is contrary to divine na∣ture; what proceeds from it is holy and pure, so let not your eyes nor minds be gathered into the manifestations, but sink down into that measure of life that ye have received, and go not out with your in-looking at what is contrary in you, for if you do you will miss of the power that should destroy it, for as ye keep in that which is pure, which is the eternal word
of the Lord, which is nigh in your hearts, it will work and op∣perate so, that it will overcome what is contrary: And so, you, dear babes, that are little and weak in your own eyes, to you is this message sent, look not at your own weakness, but look at him who is calling you in his eternal love, who will make the weak strong, and will pull down the mighty from their seat. Ah my soul, canst not thou say so by experience? yes surely; and so, dear babes, reason not with flesh and blood, nor with the voice of the Serpent, for if you do, you will darken the council of God in your selves, but in the power of the Lord shut him out, for it makes in hir a state of inoncence; had Eve done so, she had not been overcome, for this is meant towards ye, whom the Lord by his righteous Judgments hath made roome for a measure of his: But this is the council of the Lord to such as have been so overcome, while the trou∣ble and conflicts are upon their spirits, through the cause be∣fore mentioned, stand still and see the salvation of God, which is in the light of his Covenant, which will stretch forth the hand of his power, as he did to Peter when he feared the proud waves would have prevailed over him; for I can testifie, as I have received in the eternal council of the Lord, which lyes as a heavy weight upon my spirit to be discharged, That ex∣cept the Creature sink down into that that manifest and re∣vealed, and so be wrought into it natures, and so all things of Gods power and authority, ye else shall fall short of that price which that soul may attain to, which daily sinks down into it: not as though I my self have altogether attained to that degree of perfection; but this I can say in the fear and truth of the Lord, that I am one that presseth hard after it, and it is the desire of my soul, that others may joyn hands with me in this work, in that measure of life that the Father hath bestowed in us: So cease thy mourning, thou weeping babe, that mourns in secret for manifestations from thy beloved, as thou hast had in dayes past; for I can testifie unto thee by ex∣perience, whosoever thou art in that state, that he is bring∣ing thee nearer him, for that was but milk which he fed thee with whilst thou was weak, but he will feed thee with the Word from whence that milk proceedeth, if thou be willing
and obedient to live at home with Jacob, which is daily to retire thy mind; though the gadding, hunting Esau perse∣cutes thee for it, thou shalt receive the blessing in which all happiness and felicity doth consist for evermore. For as E∣sau went to hunt abroad, when the blessing was to be received at home, so I testifie unto thee from the Lord, whomsoever thou art, that art convinced that the Word is in thy heart, and yet goes a gadding and hunting after the manifestation that proceeds from the word in others vessels, I tell thee, in Gods eternal truth, whomsoever thou art, that thou maist receive them in a wrong ground, and that nature that is contrary to the Word of the Kingdome, may be alive in thee, and thou in it, in which thou canst not enter the Kingdome: Therefore come down, come down to the Word of his patience, which is nigh in your hearts, which if you do, he will keep you in the hour of temptation, which shall come to try all upon what foundation they are built; for saith Christ, which is the word of God, My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me: and I the Word will give them eternal life, and none can pull them out of his hand, which is that living Word, from whence this testimony of mine proceedeth. Oh how my bowels yernes in that li∣ving Word! yea, that ye may not fall short, but be crowned with Immortality and glory; for oh the glorious day of the Lord God hasteth to be revealed to those that are kept faith∣ful in his Word. Given forth by one whose heart the Lord hath enlarged in his own life towards ye, that I can speak it in the integrity of my soul, that if I could breath forth the measure of life that I have received, to do the least babes good, I should freely do it, who am called by the name of S. J.
