A short Relation or Testimony of the working of the light of Christ in me, from my Childhood, by one who is now a witness of the spirit of truth (whom the world cannot receive) which doth convince of sin, of righteousnesse and of judgment: and brings all things to rememberance, and shews me things to come, glory to the Lord for ever: W: B: Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ: Joh: 4:29: IN the eternall light and life of God, (wherewith stand all mankind are lighted) doe I now stand and rejoyce over the world and all its glory and enmity over the beast and false prophet with in and without having received power from the father of life (in the way of his judgments) after which my soul had long breath∣ed and thirsted, even from a Child, though then I knew not what my soul panted for, but now know the misteries of Gods everlasting Kingdome are revealed to the babes that feare him, but to others its parables. When I was about 10 years old, I doe remember, that sometimes I desired to goe and sit alone quiet in some desert place, where I might bemoan my selfe and weep in secret even untill my heart was broken, not knowing wherefore, and did begin to pray in fear to God with tears though I knew not who or where he was, but had little to speak only some thing cryed in me and breathed, confidently beleeving that God heard me where ever he was, and would pitty me and save me, at which thankes did arise unto him, not knowing it was a seed in me which was and is beloved of God, (contrary to the course of this world) to which the blessing and promises are, that did arise in the quiet of my mind to break down that which the Serpent and my own will had wrought in my heart contrary to God, that thereby I might enjoy peace in the everlasting covenant of light; for at any time when I had done or spoken that which was contrary to God, I was soon checkt for it, judged and condemned and put in fear, by his witnesse in my conscience which beheld all my wayes and wods though never so secret, and is the same that Job speakes of, which set a print upon his heeles, and mark his steps, Job 13.27. in which light I can see all that ever I have done, and doe remember the first oath that ever I swore, (being provoked by another lad) and that I was smote with trembling scarceable to stand on my feet, by the witnesse of God in my conscience which I know not then what it was, but could have fled any way from it, being put in such horrible feare and condemned by it when I had done any evill, so there is no place at last where the worker of iniquity may hide himselfe, from the dreadfull presence of God as David saith.
So about 15 yeares old I went among the Soldiers (being the time of war) not heeding the true guid, the light and spirit of God which strived often with me, to lead me in meeknesse and feare, out of all strife which comes from the lust that wars against the soule, I then was entertained, and became one among them both in gari∣son and Army, where for a season I was kept and preserved out of much wickednesse by the feare of God in me, though I knew not then where he was, nor long after; yet by his secret hand of power unexpected and undeserved, was I preserved when many were slain on my right hand and on my left hand, glory and praises to his power for ever, and ever. But about 17 yeares old I was under the command of him called Major Generall Massey, where I found many wicked and ungodly men, and some that had turned from Gorings Army among them, through which company the honest principle in me was betrayed, and even murthered, and I begin to be hardened from the fear of God (for I was but a youth, and of a bashfull countenance naturally, and was soon checkt for any evill, and felt the condemnation for it, quickly.) but now I could swear and va∣pour among them and drink till I was sometime drunk, and grew in it, untill I even took delight in swearing and drunkennesse, yet oft times when I was gone from my company alone and quiet, fear and dread from the witnesse of God in me would seaze upon me, in great and horrible terror and in the night in dreames, was I often fear∣fully scared and tormented with fearfull sights and visions of Hell and Divels, death and damnation which indeed (in that state) was my just portion, and so in the coole of the day I heard the voyce of God and was afraid, like Adam in the transgression and though I would have hid my sin like him, yet the Lord did search it out. And now I know God speaketh unto man once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not, in a dreame, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slum∣berings upon the bed, that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide prides from him, Job: 33:14: And in this company I continued neer 2 yeares untill all was disbanded; about which time I was so smitten by Gods witnesse, the light in my con∣science that I began to leave of my swearing and lewdnesse, and my prophane compa∣pany became even loathsome and burthensome unto me, and I never swoar an oath from that time to this day which is about 10 yeares agoe; so at length I became a little zealous to hear the Priests, and began to look into the Scriptures to get them to talk of, as many prophane ones doe now, to make a covering; and then thought I must be guided by the Priests, who had the learning and the tongues which they called the originall, not knowing then that their originall began at Babell, where God con∣founded the languages, and the people before were of one language, in the begining (which is the originall) so their originall is from Babell (which is confusion) where they still are, and all their followers, who will partake of their plagues if they come not forth to the light which is the originall, before Babell or the Priests, or Lattin, Greek, and Hebrew was, which Pilate set over him that is the originall, Christ, the true Pro∣phet, which all are to heare, his name is called the word of God which was in the be∣gining, John 1.1. so poor ignorant blind people that be from the light which they be lighted withall, they cryes up Greek, and Hebrew with the Priests to be the originall, and that the Scriptures cannot be understood without it, not considering that they who had Lattin, Greek, and Hebrew, crucified the son of God, who was in the begining gloryfied with the Father before the World began, (the originall) by whom the world was made, the power and wisedome of God, whose crosse to the Greeks is foolishness, and to the Jews a stumbling block, and the Greeks have Greek, and the Jews have
Hebrew, as well as the Priests and Pilate which knew not the son of God the originall, but set Lattin, Greek, and Hebrew atop of him, when they had crucified him, John 19.19:20. So for a season, these Merchants of Babilon I traded with, receiving and bying their wares, hoping it had been good durable stuffe I had got of them, being it was prised so high, and people cryed they had the originall and could give the meanings of the Scriptures, and none else, and the Beast upheld or carried the Whore and all the World wondered after them, as I did then; at length something in me began to be more and more awakened and hungered after true bread, yet thought I should be still fed at their Table, and did, untill I was neer starved with the huskes that the swine did eat, for a stirring word in me was, give me food or else I perish, and went to hear them even with teares for hunger many times, untill I perceived they spake not out of the mouth of the Lord, the word of life, the true bread that came down from hea∣ven; but had studyed and patcht up something from the Scriptures without them, mixing their meanings and Babilonish whoreish wisedome and Serpents subtilty with it, and bid us hear the word of God, and so we lookt for light, but behold darknesse and dust we were fed with; and that was made sad in me, by them, which the Lord God proclaimed joy and liberty to, as the Deceivers and false Prophets in ages past did whom God was against. And upon these Crafts men and Merchants of the great Whore, will the perpetuall plagues and vengeance of the Lord God be poured down without mixture, and as they have done, so shall it be done to them, and God will fill double to her, and she shall know that he is the Lord, that search the heart, and shews unto man his thought, and that God is light, and in him is no darknesse (or mixture) at all, and the day is hastening in which they shall howl and lament, for no man byeth her ware any more that is taught of the Lord, and the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of his power as the waters cover the Sea; and in that day the thiefe shall be ashamed that have stole the word from his neighbour, and the false Prophet which deceived the Nations shall be ashamed of his vision, and Diviners will be mad, and the Beast will hate the Whore and burn her flesh with fire, and there will be dissolation, widdowhood, and losse of children come upon her in one day, (he that readeth let him understand) And this I can truly say, and doe testifie in the Lord, That when a true hunger and thirst in me did arise after the living God, it was often hurt, darkened and spoyled by the earthly wisedome, Philosophy and vain deceit which came out of the Priests mouth, which beguiled me of my reward, drawing out my mind from the pure measure of God within, insomuch that the simple honest and meek principle which stirred in me was weary to hear them any longer; and from no other ground did I at first deny them, but as that of God in me discovered (and wit∣nest against) them as such, as should never profit the people at all, being out of his councell not able to turn any from their evill wayes, but strengthening the hands of the wicked, and making the righteous sad, this is their work as by their fruits is made ma∣nifest whose reward shall be accordingly. So in those dayes my soule was awakened by the witnesse of God, feeling the bur∣then of sin, and was ofen afraid of death, and misery, without end, but knew not how to get out from under the power of sin and death, nor to escape the wrath to come: being ignorant of him that saveth from it, which is Christ the power of God, that lighteth every man which cometh into the World which condemnes sin in the flesh, but now I see that people perish for lack of knowledge, and that the leaders of the
people cause them to err, and they that are led of them are destroyed, Isa. 9.16. for nothing will help or satisfie the longing soule immortall, but the eternall true bread of life, the power of God, which he giveth to as many as ives him that condems for sin, and destroys the works of the Divell who hath the power of death, for the sting of death is sin: so he delivers them from that which is the ground of bondage and feare of death, who beleeves in him that is the resurrection and the life, over whom the se∣cond death hath no power, glory to the Lord for ever and ever. So now having in measure began to leave the Priests, I kept at home, not desiring for a season to hear any, but to be private and quiet alone, which was a great crosse to my Parents, Wife and Relations, and also to something in me, and to my Compani∣ons and acquaintance which loved me with that love which quickly turned to hatered, so I found it hard to break the customes that I had lived in, and to become contrary to all my neighbours and acquaintance, and to loose the love of them all, as that I saw I should, if I followed that which let me see the Priests and the vanity of the World, and the Scripture speakes not in vaine, Jer. 13.23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, no more can they do good that are accustomed to do evill; hear this ye carelesse ones, that live in the vanity of your mindes, pleading for your customes, vanities, tra∣ditions and fashions of the World that lye in wickednesse, and for the fleshly lusts which wars against your own soules; the Lord God will plague you with it, and that will become the greatest torment to you, in which you have most delighted, in the day of your visitation, then you shall know you were warned in your life time; but in the middest of these my tryals and temptations within and without, a word was very nigh me, even in my heart, though I then know not what it was, saying seek first the Kingdome of God; and mind eternall life, yet not knowing where to seek or find it, but the deep consideration of it did much strengthen me towards God, and some times even breathings and cryes would ascend up from the prisoner of hope in me, and my heart was even broken and melted by the power of the word of life, which I felt therein hammering down the hardnesse thereof, and renting the vaile that sepe∣rated me from peace with God; but not knowing Christ within the hope of glory, which lighteth every man that cometh into the World, whose name is called the word of God, the Male in the flock which opened the Womb, holy to the Lord, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World, (which lies in wickednesse) the first and the last, the holy one in the midst, whom my soule loveth which had been peirced, wound∣ed, and as it were slain by that, which wars against the soule, and was a sufferer in Sodom and Egypt, but now is Lord of lords, and King of kings, glory to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever more, amen. So I began to heed and love that in me, which discovered sin and vanity and the course of the whole World, and to take it to be my companion (or Kinswoman as Solomon speak of wisedome) not knowing it to be the light of Christ, (the wisedome and power of God) in my conscience in those dayes of ignorance, but I saw often by it my own folly, and the whole World was out of course (or the way of peace) in confu∣sion and abomination, without the fear of God before their eyes, in pride and envying one another in covetousnesse and wantonnesse, dissimulation and falshood, every one for his own ends and gain, even from the Judge to the Priest, and likewise their fol∣lowers, not a wise man found among them, that feared the Lord and departed from evill, this I saw, and was sometime even greived at the consideration of it, wishing in my heart I had power to have helpt it all, being much affected with unity and peace, meeknesse and quietnesse, love and justnesse amongst men, that they might have
lived as Children of one Father, saying in my mind, did not all we come of Adam and had we not all one Father and Mother in the beginning, why then should one envy another and be high, proud, and stubborn against another, and murther each other a∣bout a little earth or vain glory that will wither, and hate, and strive, and be angry about religion, and judgments, and opinion, and even fight one against another a∣bout these things: when I considered these things in my mind, I desired God (in my heart) would remedy all this, and once put an end to it, for I even felt the whole Creation groaning in bondage under these oppressions at that time, yet not knowing that it was the light of Christ in me, which sometimes checkt me for sin and evill, that discovered these things unto me, and did open my understanding that I might have known and understood the thing that belonged to my everlasting peace; so that I can boldly say, people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: and that strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leades to the lfe, and few there be that have found it, and that the misteries of the Kingdome are hid from the wise and prudent of the World, but revealed to babes, and to such as can become fooles for Christs sake who is the light of the World, the wisedome and power of God, glory to him for ever in the highest, who hath brought me out of darknesse into his marvelous light, where I behold his likenesse. Now in these dayes, when I had even resolved never to hear the Priests, as to be a follower of them any more, yet being out of my outward imployment, and for feare of loosing all, I through perswasions of the Serpent within, and of others without, did heare them again, least I should have angered them, who had intent to imploy me, and prefer me, but I was terribly judged and condemned by Gods witnesse in me, which before had let me see the deceit of the Priests, and the vanity and error of their worship and wayes, contrary to Christ and his Apostle and their Doctrine, so in processe of time I went into France 2 small voyages, where having time, the Ser∣pent led out my mind wholy to delight in the art of Arithmetick, and the study and practise of navegation, which I saw I might in short time attain, (being acquainted with numbering which is the ground of many arts) which things took me up into an exceeding high muntain, shewing glorious promises of the preferment riches and love of the world and respect among men, which tickled the nature in me which went out from Gods witnesse, even the pride of life which is not of the Father but the world, which is the glory of the rich men, great men, and chiefe Captaines, whose flesh is to be given to the souls of heaven, in this the Supper of the great God. So through the strong temptations and allurements of this flattering harlot (the whoreish spirits gone from the light of whose cup all Nations and Kings of the earth have drunk) the honest tender principle of equity, love and meeknesse was even covered, lost and dead in me, and the spirit of the world I let in again like a floud, (whose foundation had in some measure been shaken, and the earth that lay upon the precious seed removed by the power of God) and grosse darknesse again covered my soul and vailed its life and peace from it which formerly it had felt and breathed after; so I can seale to the scriptures, they that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtfull lusts which drown men in perdition and destructi∣on, but the snare is broken and I am escaped, glory to the living God for ever more. Yet in that time I was in France, I was so much in the feare of God kept, by his pure witnesse the light in my conscience, which shewed me sin and evill, that I dared not to be lewd or drunk, or act such wickednesse as the Tempter would have led me to, not knowing that it was the light of Christ which I obeyed then, which saved me from
that which the Divell would have drew me into, so I can say with Jacob, God was in this place and I knew it not, therefore all people, come to him that tels you all that ever you did, for if you knew the gift of God, and loved him, you would ask of him water of life, but the rebellious dwell in a dry Land: but though I was preserved out of these grosse evils outwardly, yet the love of the World, and the things of the World had a strong hould in my heart, whereby the true love to equity, righteous∣nesse, and mercy was vanished away, and the place of wisedome I knew not where to find, though I sought it carefully when I felt the losse of it, but in a crosse to the will of man and of flesh, is that born which inherits Gods kingdome of peace; for after a while, when I was in the midst of my vain thoughts and imaginations, how to build great things in the earth, (to become rich, knowing and honourable therein, to ob∣tain the friendship of the World, and praise of men,) a sudden stop like a cloud came upon it all, and I was struck with a still silence in my mind, (like Adams coole of the day) wherein I saw that I strived and wearyed my selfe for very vanity that would perish with the useing, and that I like a foole might leave them in the midst of my dayes, so as I gave heed to that which let me see these things to be but as shaddow, and that it was folly so eagerly to pursue that which made themselves wings, and thereby to be beguiled of an eternall Crown of rest to my immortall soule, my for∣mer condition came fresh into my remembrance, and I began to feele something stirr in me for life, which lay in death and bondage under Pharaoh in spiritually Egypt, and as it were a cry ascended from the Prisoner, groaning afar off for deliverance: and then I began to be troubled and condemned in my selfe; and my peace in the earth was broken, and the flaming sword turned every way upon it; then being afraid of shame, I strived with Gods spirit in me (not knowing what it was all this while nor some time after) and would passe away the trouble as much as I could sometime, and even wisht I could be meek like others, for I often witnessed Solomons words: (in the midst of laughter the heart is made sad,) and was neerer weeping then mirth many times in such Company, so I had no rest to my soule in those dayes, being ig∣norant of my Teacher, the true Shpeherd of Israell, which gives his sheep (that follow him) eternall life, meek and low in the heart. But now my soule being like one awakened from sleep, and hungery after that which satisfieth, I began again to seek for food and rest, and to injoy life and peace which changeth not, then I thought in my mind what shall I doe? remembering the Priests (which were discovered by the same witnesse of Gd again) to be miserable Comforters, and such as daub with untempered morter, (as all the World shall wit∣nesse in the day at hand, when the wall is no more nor they that daubed it) and Phisi∣tians of no value, but rather robbers and murthers of the innocent and just prin∣ciple in poor ignorant people that cryes for deliverance. Then not knowing what to do for life (being gone foth hunting abroad like Esau and all his stock of Priests and Professors in the World for food) I went among the people called Baptists to see if I could obtain rest and peace there among them, thinking if they be the people of God, I had right to have fellowship with them, and to partake of their promises and priviledges, for I often felt something in me which was beloved of God, so concluded that I was one of the elect, not then knowing and discerning things that differ, that it was a seed in man (which may be by him, op∣pressed and trod under foot) to which the promises and the blessing is, and the elect is before the foundation of the World, and the whole World lies in wickednesse: Read this if thou can that cry the election of a perticular people, and the rest left
to themselves, and beware of the Doctrine of Divels, and remember that God is no respecter of persons, and Christ the true light, lighteth every man that cometh into the World, in whom is the election and redemption, and he that knows not Christ in him is a reprobate as saith the Scripture 2 Cor. 13.5. So then I became a constant follower of them, and at length was in that fellowship with them, and Brother-hood which the naturall carnall visible water was the ground off; for before I was dipt in water they call'd me not Brother, but suddenly after they did, yet I was the same e∣very way as before, no more bettered nor satisfied by the water after I came to Gods witnesse in me in the coole of the day, which let me see my soul lay in death, though the comprehending mind had got a lfe and food in a profession, in which I had no true peace when all was performed and done by which I thought to obtain: But it still fled from me as I tuned to that in my heart which let me see my state and condition, even the light of Christ though I knew not then what it was: so now I know there is no peace to the wicked, and that the woe is to them that are covered with a covering and not with the pure spirit of God which reproves the World of sin, neither should I ever attained it in that way if I had walked therein 100 yeares: for we came not to Christ (but denyed him) whose flesh is meat indeed, and is the true bread which gives life to the World: neither were we joyned together in the unity of the faith of the Lord of glory which is without re∣spect of Persons, and is a mistery held in a pure conscience, giving victo∣ry over the World, being all from the light which we were lighted withall, that is to give people the knowledge of God, in which the Saints inheritance and fellowship is. But we were building a Tower (hoping the top would have reacht to Heaven) in our imaginations like the confounded Builders of old (like Nim∣rods stock) the beginning of whose Kingdome was Babell that hunted before the Lord, who is that spirit which will confound all your wisedome who build without his light, the Corner-stone, the sure foundation, though you may say Lord, Lord, this availes not, while yee are workers of ini∣quity you are shut out, so we were professing and talking of the truth (which makes free) Christ the light, the way to the Father, but we were in bondage, darknesse and falshood in the broad way, wherein many hipo∣crites, deceitfull workers, envious, proud, and covetous may walk, keeping their covering of their profession, and talking of him that leads to life out of death, darknesse and all unrighteousnesse, in which you hold the truth of God, his witnesse the light that you be lighted withall, which lets you see you have not the true bread of life that gives peace, rest and satisfaction to the soule, but feeds on the husk: notwithstanding your great noise of him that is the substance of all, which ends the shaddowes, but expects his Kingdome and glory and reign without you, ô yee fooles and blinde; is not the Kingdome of God within you? and is not the Kings daughter all glorious within? and did not the King say: goe not forth when they shall say loe here and loe there, believe them not? But in this state I was once with you untill the Son of God opened his eyes that was born blinde, whom the Pharisees cast out, as they have many in this age that tremble at the word of the Lord, but the Lord God
of power hath appeared to their joy, and you shall be ashamed, though you may say the Lord be glorified; in whose eternall light I then saw in this profession without life, I was never like to have peace to that which was awakened in me, breathing for the pure righteous power of the living God, which all men had been erred and estranged from by transgression (the mid∣dle wall that seperates) which by the higher power is broken downe where the salvation is wrought out with feare and trembling, which the professor denyes, casting out such as tremble at the word which is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, and the time is come that they can∣not endure sound Doctrine: this is to you all Priests, Baptists and people that be from the light which you be lighted withall, that lets you see your ungodly deeds and hard speeches, what shall I say more of you. Why you passe over judgement, and so the love of God you know not, this is from the Lord God to you, as shall be witnesse on your death bed: So after a season, in this my breathing and longing condition, in which I desired that God would make an alteration and change among us (being in all we performed dead to the pure simple life of God, for which my soul thirsted) it happened, that I heard a book read of the sufferings of some of the people of God (who were called quakers) in a dungeon at Suesham, whose name and sufferings was strange to me at that time; yet at the hearing of it, something in me did arise with much tendernesse and pitty toward the innocent suffering people, which drew tears from mine eyes, believing they did suffer for conscience sake, and the same thing in me even said that God would avenge them on the bloudy per∣secutors, (which hath been performed by his mighty hand of power on some of them even to the cutting them of the earth as briars and thornes for the fire) but did not know all this time what it was that let me see these things, and knew not light from darknesse (as is the state of thou∣sands, who professe Christ (as I did in words,) who lighte every man that cometh into the world and leads his sheep out of darknesse into the fould of eternall life and peace from which the wise and prudent withall their knowledge, comprehension and imaginations are shut out for ever. Then I heard Jacob Behements bookes, and began to read much in them, and to gather something of that into my comprehension and imaginati∣ons in the braine, but this and all the other gave not pace and rest to the immortall soule which still lay in death and bondage, by reason of transgression and sin; but not long after came one, a Minister of the word of life (whose name few know) and preached to the spirit in prison which rejoyced much at the sound of his words to which I gave diligent heed, and was eternally convinced that it was the very truth he declared, and that there is no other way to know God (or to be saved) but as I walked in the light which I was lighted withall which did let me see all my ungodly deeds and hard speeches that ever I had committed, which light comes from Christ the Saviour, and leads all that follow it, out of the evill that is in the world, unto him that was before the world was, by whom it was made, gloryfied with the Father; the substance of all the types, figures, shaddows, ordenances, of which might be spoken many things, but he is the sum, that redeems man by his blood (the
life) out of the earth into which man was driven in transgression, up unto God againe before transgression was to the beginning and the end: So as to the true light in my heart, my mind was turned, many Scrip∣tures came fresh unto me confirming the truth of which he spoke, and the povver of the vvord, in my heart, of God, vvhich the light comes from, began to stir and vvorke, and condemnation vvas admi∣nistred upon all my former profession, and a svvord vvas comming upon the earth, vvhich had sate still in peace and open vvar vvas proclaimed a∣gainst the beast, vvhore, and false prophet, by the lambe that vvas slaine vvhose svvord came out of his mouth, and the prisoner of hope re∣joyced at the begining of this day of vengeance, believing the yeare of redemption vvas come; so that here vvas a change began, and that vvhich seemed strang to me vvas happened, vvhich vvas quickly perceiv∣ed by the baptists, vvho vvere then my companions in profession (but not in tribulation) for I vvas made to vveepe and lament, seeing all the religion in the vvorld to be but as a fading Leafe, vvithout the pure life and povver of God vvhich saveth from sinne, and brings into unity vvith him; so that I could no longer be satisfied nor live, in a talke of God and Christ, and not enjoy the eternall rest, even the sincere milke of the immortall vvord of life vvhich my soule breathed after even from a Childe, though I knevv not vvhat it vvas, nor vvhere to find it; but in this my troubled condition many baptists follovved day and night to persvvade me out of it, looking upon me, to be delud∣ed and some vvith prayers, and some vvith flatteryes, and others of them vvith envious vvords strived to get me back to them, telling me that I vvas fallen from grace, and vvas become under the Lavv, and make∣ing the blood of Christ of none effect, but I not knovving then the blood to be the life, and that the life is the light of men, though I vvas convinced in my conscience of the eternall truth, yet my understanding God vvas con∣founding, and the day of the Lord vvas darknesse and not light to that part which had held the truth in unrighteousnesse (as they shall all one day vvitnesse) vvhere their covering is rent of them, and their inside made more manifest, vvho by their many tattling vvords drevv out my minde from Gods vvitnesse in me, and from the Law vvritten in the heart, to vvhich I should have kept and been faithfull (even the sure word of prophecy which let me see all that ever I did) for Moses vvas faithfull as a servant in all his house, but this mistery I knew not then, and so to get ease turned out my minde from the truth which is required in the inward parts, and gave heed to seducing spirits, and words which darkned councell, in so much that I joyned againe vvith them in more zeal then before, and encouraged others to follovv their strong imaginations from the letter of Scripture, looking for a Saviour vvithout us, though the Scripture saith Christ within the hope of glory, and know yee not that Christ is in you except yee be reprobates, &c: And for his comming
without us, though he said, when they shall say loe here and loe there believe them not, and goe not forth: and for his Kingdome and glory vvithout us, though the Kings Daughter is all glorious vvithin, and the King said, the Kingdome of God is within you, and for his re∣surrection and life and reign without us, when as the King said, I am the resurrection and the life, and am come a light into the world, (who lighteth every man that commeth into the world) these things we imagined and builded one another up in contrary to the Scrip∣ture, and to the Saints which builded up in that which is a mi∣istery held in a pure conscience; so we past over judgement (like the Pharisees and hipocrites of old, which did professe and say, but doe not) climbing up an easier way then by the doore, (Christ who condemnes sinne in the flesh) like the theife that had stolen a covering, even words from the neighbour, but af∣ter a season these things came heavy upon me, and was more harder to be judged out and destroyed then all the other wick∣ednesse and iniquity that ever I committed; for when I being unsatisfied came from the baptists againe, (having suffered per∣secution for the name of Christ) resolved with purpose of heart to waite on the Lord, whatever became of all the world, their glory, profession, or enmity: for a word was powerfully in me, [seek first the Kingdome of God] to which I gave heed, and turned my minde againe to the light which had checkt me for sinne from my childe-hood, which Christ had enlightened me withall, and the power of God was manifested, and his dreadfull judgements fell on the whore which went out from the life into a profession, and plagues, and fa∣mine, and earth-quakes, and thunders, warre and tremblings, sigh∣ing, mourning, weeping, and fasting, and great astonishments came upon that ground in me which before professed the Scriptures: and all that ever I had acted or spoken out of the light, was judg∣ed, cursed and condemned, whether, eating or forbearing, or drinking or forbearing, lying downe or rising up, sleeping or waking, going out or comming in, all was judged and condemned untill the meeke came to ride King upon the foal of an asse, and Sion redeemed with judgement, which came to passe as obe∣dience was yeilded to the higher power, who with his mighty and peircing sword wounded Leviathan and slew the Dragon that was in the Sea, and the great whore was plagued (the beast and false Prophet together) of whose cupp of fornication all Na∣tions and Kings of the earth have drunke who must drinke freely as I have done, of the cupp of the wine of the fiercenesse of the wrath of the Lord God almighty, or else shall never know rest and peace in the Land of the Living; For Caine the first birth, the envious one the murtherer is
vagabond from God, and Ishmaell the wilde man, the mocker is cast out, and Esau the cunning hunter is rejected, the prophane person, and all proud Hamans stock, and Naballs race, these must have their part in the Lake of torment, for dreadfull plagues and vengeance is comming upon all the worlds nature from the ter∣rible God of power, who is now come to reigne in righteous∣nesse, therefore woe to the inhabitance of the earth, all yee proud, wanton, envious, covetous, and deceitfull ones, and all Hypocrites, and ungodly ones Torment, howling, wrath and perpetuall misery with lamentation forever is your portion, except you speedily repent: Therefore all people upon earth turne your mindes to light wherewith you are enlightened by Christ Jesus the Saviour which lets you see sinne and evill, least you be by him turn∣ed into everlasting misery and utter darkenesse, where will be no end of your sorrow and paine, and repent and prise your time, and stopp not the care nor close the eye against that in you which rises for deliverance, and is sad in the midst of your vaine mirth, which cannot be satisfied with any thing of this World; but heed that which sheweth you the evill of the World, for that leades out of it, and all its wayes, worships, fashion, and traditions, (which are vaine and fading) up to Christ who is not of the world, by whom it was made, who lighteth every man that com∣eth into the world, the salvation of all that obey him: And this is he who hath led me out of the world through great Tribulations unto the good Land of rest, glory to him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lambe for ever and ever, whose power once killed, but now makes alive, and having slaine the enmity by the blood of his Crosse, whose owne arme hath brought salvation, glory and everlasting praises unto the Lord God omnipotent, who have given power and strength, wisedome, dominion and eternall blessing to the Lambe slaine, who was once in Sodom and Egypt crucified spiritually, but now his life the grave cannot hold, but hath rissen tryumphing over the principallityes and powers of the world, by whose power the horse and his rider is cast into the sea, and now reignes in righteousnesse, and in it doth judge and make warre, being Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, whose name is called the word of God, from whence the true light comes which lighteth every man that commeth into the world, everlasting prayers and glory to his powerfull name in the highest, Amen:
