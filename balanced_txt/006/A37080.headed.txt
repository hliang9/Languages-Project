A PETITION TO THE HONOURABLE HOUSE OF THE COMMONS IN ENGLAND NOW ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT. Whereunto are added CERTAINE CONSIDERATIONS, SHEWING The necessity of a CORRESPON∣DENCIE in Spirituall matters betwixt all Protestant Churches. By John Dury. LONDON, Printed for William-Hope, at the signe of the Unicorn in Cornhill, neere the Royall-Exchange. Anno Domini, 1642.
TO THE Honourable the Knights, Citi∣zens, and Burgesses of the House of COMMONS in Parliament, The humble Petition of John Dury, Mini∣ster of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the worke of Peace Ecclesiasticall amongst Protestants. SEeing the motion of furthering Ecclesiasticall Reconcilement a∣mongst Protestants hath been hitherto very favourably enter∣tained by forraine States and Churches, which your Petitioner hath dealt with∣all; so that Acts and Declarations have bin made, and given to your Petitioner, wherein they manifest their resolutions to advance the Worke, and main∣taine Correspondencie with others to that effect;
which hath been done not onely by those that are abroad in Germany, and elsewhere, but also here at home in the last generall Assembly of the Church of Scotland, where it hath been enacted, that from henceforth they should lay this matter to heart, and contribute their assistance thereunto: and to this end they have appointed certaine Divines to correspond with your Petitioner towards the pro∣moting of his endeavours of Peace. And seeing moreover your Petitioner doth with all thank∣fulnesse unto Almighty God cheerfully observe, by the clause inserted into the publike Remon∣strance of the State of this Kingdome, that there is a most laudable purpose intended, and a good inclination expressed towards the furthering of the good of all Protestants, for the preservation of true Religion, and the Union of their Chur∣ches with ours in the same cause, against the com∣mon Enemies, which by our divisions are encou∣raged to intend, and enabled to worke out our de∣struction; which they will certainly bring to passe, if the Fatherly Providence of our good GOD, whose councells are unsearchable, and his waies past finding out, doth not prevent their malice, by our loving concurrence in the waies of Brotherly
Union, for the maintaining of his glorious Go∣spel. And seeing lastly, it is a publike request in the late Petition of the Reverend Ministers, that a day of Fasting and Prayers, for the welfare and prosperity of this Church and State may be set apart every moneth, so long as your Honourable Assembly shall continue, wherein I heartily con∣curre with them: Therefore your Petitioner doth humbly request, that in the Order, which hopefully will be made for the observation of that day of Fasting and Praying, this purpose of Ecclesiasticall Recon∣cilement of Protestants by the Union of their spirits in the Truth of GOD, and against the Adversaries of Christs Gospell, may be expresly mentioned to be recommended unto GOD, by the prayers of that publike meeting. And also, that some Divines may be thought upon, and nominated unto your Petitioner, to whom he should make his addresse to begin a spirituall correspon∣dencie, which in this purpose is necessary, for the preparing and ripening of such proposals, as by the Grace of GOD will be able to bring the wished for Union of Protestants in due time to some perfection.
And your Petitioner, as in duty bound, shall daily pray for his Majesties long life, his peaceable and happy raigne over us, and for the prosperous successe of all your councells and undertakings to∣wards the blessed and flourishing estate of this Church and Kingdome.
