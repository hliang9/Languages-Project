Saterday I am comynge laste Trustynge on the tyme well spent Hauynge euer mynde stedfaste On that lorde that harowed hell That he my synnes wyll expell At the instaunce of his Mother whose goodnesse dothe farre excell whome I serue aboue all other amen. The commaundementes of  gyuen by Moyses / and expounded by  to our Mother tongue / very necessarye and ex∣pedyent for Youthe and all other for to lerne and to knowe. ¶ I Am the Lorde thy god / whi¦che haue brought the out of the lande of Egypt and out of the house of bōdage  Thou shalte ha¦ue none other goddes ī my syght.  Thou shalte make the no grauē Ymage: neyther any simi∣litude that is ī heuē aboue or in the earthe beneathe / or in the water that is beneath the earthe. Se that thou neyther bowe thy selfe to them: neyther serue them. For I the lorde thy god am a gelouse god / & vysite the syn∣ne of the fathers vpō the chyldrē vnto the thyrde and fourth generacyō of them that hate me / and
yet shewe mercye to thousandes amōge thē that loue me and kepe my commaundementes. Heare Israell / our lorde god is one lorde: and thou shalt loue thy lorde god with all thy herte / with all thy Sou∣le / with all thy mynde / and with ali thy strength. Thou shalte worshyp thy lorde god / & hym onely shalte thou serue. ¶ Hou shalt not take the name of the lorde thy god in vayne. For the Lorde wyll not holde hym gyltlesse / that taketh the name of the lorde his god in vayne. Ye haue herde howe it was sayde to thē of olde tyme. Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe / but shalte performe thyn othes to the Lorde. say vnto you / sweare not at all: neyther by he∣uē / for it is goddes seate / nor by the earth / for it is his fote stole / neyther by Ierusalē / for it is the Ci¦tye of ye great kynge. Neyther shalt thou sweare by thy heade: bycause thou canst not make one whyte heare or a blacke. But let your communi∣cacyon be: yea / eya & nay naye: for what soeuer is more then that / commeth of euyll. ¶ Emembre the Sabbath daye that thou sanctify it.  Syxe dayes mayste thou labour / and do all that thou hast to do / but the seuenth daye is the Sabbath of the Lorde thy god. In it thou shalte do no maner worke /
neyther thou / nor thy sone / nor thy doughter neyther thy manseruaunt / nor thy mayde ser∣uaunt / nor thy catell: nor yet the straunger that is within thy gates. For in syxe dayes the Lorde made heuen and earth / and the see / and all that is in them / and rested the seuenth day wherfore the Lorde blessed the seuenth daye / & halowed it  It is lefull to do a good dede on the Sabbath day. For the sone of mā is lorde euen of the Sabbath day. The Lorde sayth by his prophet.  That his sabbath is halowed and kepte / when we rest and cease to do our owne wyll / to folowe oure owne wayes / & to speake our owne wordes: when we in worde / thought / and dede fulfyll his well (I say) & not ours: and when we suffer hym to do his workes in vs / that at the last / we may come to that Sab∣bath and true reste / euen eternall lyfe / whiche Chryst the Lorde of the sabbath hath opteyned for vs by his blode. ¶ Onoure thy Father and thy Mother / that thy dayes may be longe in the lande whi∣che the lorde thy god gyueth the. onour thy father and thy mother. Honour father and mother: this is the fyrste commaundement that hath any promyse that thou mayst be in good estate: and lyue longe on the earthe. By this commaundement Chryste
teacheth vs not onely to haue our father and mother in reuerence / and to obey them / as he hym selfe was subiecte vnto his Mother the virgyn Mary: but also to minyster vnto theyr ne¦cessytes. ¶  Hou shalt not kyll. Matth. v. Ye haue herde how it was sayde vnto them of the olde tyme. Thou shalt not kyll. who soeuer kyil¦leth shalbe in daunger of iudgement. But I say to you: who soeuer is angry with his brother shalbe in daunger of iudgement. who soeuer sayth to his brother / Racha: shalbe in daunger of a counsell. But who soeuer sayth: thou fole shalbe in daunger of hell fyer.  Ye haue herde howe it is sayd. Thou shalte loue thy neyghbour: and hathe thyn enemye. But I say vnto you / loue your enemyes / blysse them that curse you / do good to them that hathe you pray for them that do you wronge and persecute you: that ye may be the chyldrē of your father whiche is in heuen. For he maketh the sonne to ary∣se on the euyll and on the good: and sendeth his rayne on the iuste and on the vniuste. ¶ Hou shalt not breake wedlocke. Math. v Ye haue herde how it was sayd to them of olde tyme / thou shalte not commyt aduoutry. But I say to you / that who soeuer loketh on a wyfe / luslynge after her / hath cōmytted aduou∣try
with her all redy in his herte.  Let wedlocke be had in pryce in all poyntes / and let thy chambre be vndefyled / for hoore kepers and aduouterers God wyll iudge. ¶ Hou shalt not steale.  Steale not: defraude no man. Yf any man wyll sue the at the lawe / and take thy coe from the: let hym haue thy cloke also: gyue to hym that asketh: and from hym that wolde bo∣rowe: turne not awaye.  Now is the∣re vttelye a faute amonge you: because ye go to lawe one with another? Why rather suffre ye not wrōge? why rather suffre ye not your selues to be robbed? yea / euen youre selues do wronge and robbe and that the brethrene. Ephesi. iiij. Let hym that dyd steale / steale no more / but let him rather labour with his handes some good thynge that he maye haue to gyue vnto hym that nedeth. ¶ Hou shalte beare no false wytnesse a∣gaynst thy neyghbour.  Beare no false wytnesse I say to you / that of euery ydle worde whiche men shal haue spoken they shal gyue aecomptes at the daye of iudge∣ment.  Wherfore put away lyng / and speake euery man trueth to his neyghboure / for as moche as we are membres one of ano∣ther. Let not fylth communycacyon procede out
of your mouthes: but that whiche is good to edifye with al / when nede is / that it may haue auur with the hearers. Ephe. v. Let al bytter∣nesse / fearsnesse and wrath / rorynge and cursed speakyng / be put away from you. Let no fylthy∣nesse / folysshe talkyng / nor iestynge (whiche are not comly) be ones named amonge you: but ra∣ther gyuyng of thankes. ¶ Hou shalt not coueyt thy neyghboures house. Neyther shalt thou coueyt thy neyghbours wyfe: his man seruaunt / his mayde his oxe / his asse / or ought that is his.  What soeuer ye wolde that men shulde do to you: euen so doo ye to them. To loue a mannes neyghbour as hym selfe / is a greater thynge then all burnte offerynges and sacryfyces. Be not ouercomme with luste / for the care of this worlde and the di∣sceytfulnesse of ryches choke te worlde. Let your conuersacyon et without couetousnes / and be content with that that ye haue al redy. Godlynes is great ryches / yf a man be content with that he hath. For we brought nothynge in to the worlde / and it is a playne case / that we cary nothyng out. When we haue fode and rayment / let vs ther with be content. They that wyll be ryche / fall in to temptacyon and snares / and in to many folysshe and noysom lustes / whiche drowne men
in perdicyon and destruccion. For couetousnes is the rote of all euyl: whiche whyle some lusted after / they erred from the fayth / and tangled thē selues with many sorowes. hese wordes which I cōmaunde the this day shall be in thyne herte / and thou shalt whette them on thy chyldren / and shalt talke of them when thou arte at home in thy house / and as thou walkest by the way / and when thou lyest downe / and when thou rysest vp: and thou shalte bynde them for a sygne vpon thy hande. And they shall be papers of remembraunce bytwene thyne eyes / and thou shalte wryte them vpon the postes of thy house / and vpon thy gates. ake hede and heare al these wodes which I commaunde the / that it may go wel with the / and with thy chyldren after the for euer / when thou doest that whiche is good and ryght in the syght of the lorde thy god. Se thou do that whiche is ryght in the syght of the lord / that thou mayst prosper. Ye shall do after nothynge that we do here this day / euery man what semeth hym good in his owne eyes. But what soeuer I com∣maunde you / that take hede ye do / and put no∣thynge therto / nor take ght therfrom. Cursed be he that contynueth not in all the wordes of this lawe / to do them. Yf ye loue me / kepe my commaundemē∣tes.  Happy are they that heare the
worde of god / and kepe it.  who soeuer shall kepe the hole lawe / and yet fayle in one poynt / he is gylty in al. For he that sayd. Thou shalt not commyt aduoutry: sayd also: thou shalt noc kyll.

The passyon. UHē Iesus had spoken these wordes he wente forth with his discyples ouer the broke Cedrō: where was a gardeyn / ī to the whiche he entred with his discyples. Iudas al so: which betrayd hym / knew the place for Ies{us} of tymes resorted thy∣ther with his discyples. Iudas thē after that he had receyued a bonde of men / and mynysters of the hye preestes and pharises / came thyther with lanternes and fyerbrōdes and weapons. Then Iesus knowynge all thynges that shulde come on hym / went forth and sayde vnto thē / whome sekeye? They answered hym. Iesus of Nazareth Iesus sayde vnto thē / I am he. Iudas also whi∣che betrayed hym stode with hym. But as sone as he had sayd to them. I am he: they wēt backe∣wardes and fell to the groūde. And he asked thē agayne / whome sekeye? They sayd Iesus of Na∣zareth. Iesus answered / I sayde vnto you / I am he. Yf ye seke me / let these go theyr way / that the sayeng myght be fulfylled / whiche he spake. Of them which thou gauest me / haue I not loste one Symon Peter hadde aswearde / and drewe it / & smote the hye preestes seruaunt / and cut of his
ryghte eare. The seruauntes name was Malcus The sayde Iesus vnto Peter: shall I not drynke of the cuppe / whiche my father hathe gyuen me. Then the companye and the captayne / and the mynysters of the Iewes toke Iesus and bounde hym / and ledde hym awaye to Anna fyrste: for he was father law vnto Cayphas / whiche was the hye preest that same yeare. Cayphas was he that gaue counsell to the Iewes that it was expedyēt that one man shulde dye for the people. And sy∣mō Peter folowed Iesus / & another discyple that discyple was knowē of the hye p̄este / & wēt ī with Ies{us} ī to the palayes of the hye preest. But Peter stode at the dore without. Then went that other discyple whiche was knowen vnto the hye preest and spake to the dāsell that kepte the dore / and brought in Peter. Then sayde the damsell that kepte the doore vnto Peter. Arte not thou one of this mannes discyples? He sayde. I am not. The seruauntes and the ministers stode there / and had made a fyre of cooles / for it was colde: and they warmed them selfes. Peter also stode amon¦ge them and warmed him selfe. The hye preestes asked Iesus of his discyples / and of his doctryne Iesus answered hym. I spake openly in the worlde. I euer taught in the synagoge and in the temple / whereal the Iues resorted / and in se∣crete haue I sayde nothyng. Uvhy askest thou me? Aske them whiche herde me / what I sayde vnto them.

Yf I haue speken well / why smytest thou me. And Annas sent hym bounde vnto Cay¦phas the hye Preeste. Symon Peter stode and warmed hym selfe. And they sayde vnto hym. Arte thou not also one of his discyples. He denyed it / and sayde. I am not. One of the seruauntes of the hye preest (his cosyn / whose eare Peter smote of) sayde vnto hym. Dyd not I se the in the Bardeyn with hym. Peter de∣nyed it agayne / and immediatly the cocke crewe. Then ledde they Iesus from Cayphas into the halle of iudgement. It was in the mornynge / and they theym selfes wente not in to the iudgement halle / lest they shulde be defyled: but that they myghte eate the pa∣schall Lambe. Pylate then wente out vn∣to them / and sayde. Uvhat accusacyon bryn∣ge you agaynste this man. They answered and sayde vnto hym. Yf he were not an euyll doer / we wolde not haue delyuered hym vnto the. Thē sayde Pylate vnto them. Take ye hym / and iud∣ge hym after youre owne lawe. Then the Iewes sayde vnto hym. It is not laufull for vs to put any man to deathe. That the wordes of Iesus myght be fulfylled which he spake sygnyfyenge what deathe he shulde dye. Then Pylate en∣tred into the iudgement hall agayne / and called
Ies{us} and sayd vnto hym Arte thou the kynge of the Iewes? Iesus answered. Sayest thou that of thy selfe / or dyd other tell it the of me. Pylate answered. Am I a Iewe. Thyne owne nacyō and hye Preestes haue delyuered the vnto me. Uvhat haste thou done. Iesus answered. My kyngedo∣me is not of this worlde. Yf my kyngedome were of this worlde / then wolde my mynysters surelye fyghte / that I shulde not be delyuered vnto the Iewes / but nowe is my kyngedome not frō hen∣se. Pylate sayde vnto hī. Arte thou a kynge thē. Iesus answered. Thou sayest that I am a kynge For this cause was I borne / & for this cause came I ī to the world / that I shuld beare wytnesse vn to the trueth. And al that are of the trueth hea∣re my voyce. Pylate sayd vnto hym. what thyn∣ge is trueth. And when he had sayde that he wēt out agayne vnto the Iues / and sayd vnto them: I fynde in hym no cause at all. Ye haue a custome that I shulde delyuer you one loose at Easter. wyl ye that I loose vnto you the kyng of Iewes? Then cryed they al agayn sayeng. Not hym / but Barabas. That Barabas was a robber. Thē Py¦late toke Iesus and scourged hym. And the soul diours woūde a crowne of thornes and put it on his head. And they dyd on hym o purple garmēt / and sayde: Nayle kynge of the Iewes. And they smote hym on the face. Pylate went forth agayn and sayde vnto thē. Beholde I bryng hym forth to you / that ye may knowe / that I fynde no faute in hym. Thē came Ies{us} forth wearynge a crowne
of thorne and a robe of purple. And Pylate sayd vnto thē. Beholde the man. When the hye pre∣esles and mynysters sawe hym / they cryed / sayēg Crucyfye hym / Crucyfye hym. Pilate sayd vnto thē. Take ye hym / and crucyfy hym. For I fynde no cause in hym. The Iues answered hym. We haue a lawe / and by our law he ought to dye / be∣cause he made hym selfe the sone of god. When Pylate herde that sayenge / he was the more a∣frayde: and sayd vnto Iesus: whense arte thou? but Iesus gaue hym none answere. Then sayde Pylate vnto hym. Speakest thou not vnto me. Knowen thou not that I haue power to loose the? Iesus answered. Thou couldest haue no po∣wer at all agaynst me / except it were gyuen the frō aboue. Therfore he that delyuered me vnto the / is more ī synne. And from hēs forth sought Pylate meanes to loose hym. But the Iewes cryed / sayng. Yf thou let hym go thou arte not Cesars frēde. For who soeuer maketh hym selfe a kynge / is agaynst Cesar. When Pylate herde that sayēge / he brought Ies{us} forth / & sat downe to gyue sentence / in a place called the Pauemēt but ī the Hebrew tonge Babbatha. It was the Saboth euen: whiche falleth in the Easter feest & aboue the syrte houre. And he sayde vnto the Iewes: Beholde your kynge. They cryed / away with hym / away with hym. Crucify hym. Pylate sayde vnto them. Shall I crucify your kynge. The hye preestes answered / we haue no kynge but Cesar. Then delyuered he hym vnto them to
be crucifyed. And they toke Iesus and led hym away. And he bare his crosse and wente for to a place / called the place of deade mennes sculles (which is named in Hebrewe / Golgatha (where they crucifyed hym. And with hym two other / on eyther syde one / and Iesus in the mydes. Pyla∣te wrote his tytle / and put it on the crosse. The wrytinge was. Iesus of Nazareth / kynge of the Iues. This tytle red many of ye Iewes. For the place where Iesus was crucifyed / was nygh to the cyte. And it was wrytté in Hebrewe / Greke / and latyn. Then sayde the hye preestes of the Iues to Pylate / wrytte not kyng of the Iewes: but that he sayde / I am kynge of the Iues. Py∣late answered. What I haue wryten / that ha∣ue I wryten. Then the souldiours when they had crucifyed Iesus / toke his garmētes and ma¦de. iiij. partes: to euery souldyour a parte and al¦so his cote. There was a cote without seme / wrought open throughout. And they sayde one to another. Let vs not deuyde it: but cast lottes who shall haue it. That the scrypture myght be fulfylled / whiche sayth. They parted my raymēt amonge them and on my coe dyd catte lottes. And the souldyours dyd suche thynges in de∣de. There stode by the crosse of Iesus / his mo∣ther / & his mothers syster / Mary the wyfe Cleo∣phas: and Mary magdalene. Whē Iesus sawe his mother: and the discyple standynge / whome he loued / he sayde vnto his mother: woman / be∣holde thy sone. Then sayde he to the discyple. be∣holde
thy mother. And from that houre the discy¦ple toke her for his owne. After that when Ies{us} perceyued that all thynges were performed / that the scrypture myght be fulfylled he sayde / I thryst. There stode a vessell full of vynegre by And they fylled a sponge with vynegre / and wounde it about with ysope: and put it to his mouthe. Assone as Iesus had receyued of the by negre / he sayde. It is finysshed. And bowed his heade / and gaue vp the ghoste The Iewes then because it was the Saboth euē / that the bodyes shulde not remayne vpon the crosse on the Sa∣both daye (for yt saboth daye was an hye daye) besought Pylate that theyr legges myght be broken / and that they myght be taken downe. Then came the souldyours and brake the leg∣ges of the fyrste / and of the other / whiche was crucyfyed with Iesus But when they came to Iesus: and sawe that he was dead alredy / they brake not his legges but one of the souldyours with a spere / thrust hy min to the syde / and forth with came oute bloude and water. And he that sawe it bare recorde and his recorde is true And he knoweth that he sayth true / that ye myght beleue also. These thinges were doone that the scrypture myght be fulfylled. Ye shall not brea∣ke a bone of hym. And agayne another scryptu∣re sayth. They shall loke on hym / whom they pearsed. After that Ioseph of Aramathia (whi∣che was a discyple of Iesus but secretly for fea∣re of the Iues) besought pylate that he myght
take downe the body of Iesus. And Pylate ga∣ue hym lycence. And there came also Nicode∣mus whiche at the begynnynge came to Iesus by nyght / and brought of myrre and Aloes myn gled togyther: about an hōdred pounde wayght Them toke they the body of Iesu and wounde it in lynnen clothes with the odoures / as the ma∣ner of ye Iewes is to burye.

I gaue them thy worde / & the world hated them bycause they be not of the worlde: lyke as I am not of the worlde. I asked not that thou shuldest take them away out of the world / but that thou kepe them from the wycked. They be not of the worlde / lyke as I am not of the worlde. Make them holy in thy trueth. Lyke as thou hast sent me in to the worlde / so haue I sente thē in to the worlde / and for thē I do sanctifye my selfe / that they also may be sanctifyed in the trueth. And I pray not only for them / but also for thē that shall
beleue in me through theyr preachynges: so that all they may be one. Lyke as thou (father) arte in me & I in the / that they also maye be in vs / that the worlde may beleue that thou hast sent me. And the glorye whiche thou hast gyuen me / I ga¦ue it them that they myght be one: lyke as we be one / I in them / and thou in me / that they may be made perfyte in one / and that the worlde maye know that thou hast sent me / and loued them as thou haste loued me. Father / they whome thou haste gyuē me I wyll that where I be / they may also be with me that they may se my glory which thou gauest me / for thou hast loued me before ye makynge of the worlde. Iuste father / the worlde knoweth the not: but I know the & these knowe that thou hast sent me and I haue made knowē vnto then thy name and I wyll make it knowē / to the entent that the loue wherwith thou louest me myght be in them / and I in them. ¶ u deus noster suauis et verus es. Hou our god arte gentyll & true / pacyent and with mer¦cy orderynge all thynges. For yf we synne / we be thyne knowynge thy greatnes / & yf we syn̄e not / we knowe that with the we be reke∣ned. For to know the is perfyte & consumate ryghtwysnes / and to knowe thy iustyce and vertue is the rote of im∣mortalyte.
So be it. ¶  n tonso capite corruens in terram. Ob (his he ade clypped) fal∣lynge flatte on the grounde worshypped god sayeng. Naked I entred out of my mothers wō∣e / and naked I shall retourne. The lorde hath gyuē the goodes / and the lorde hath taken them away. As it pleased the lorde so it is done. Blyssed be the name of the lorde. So be it. ¶  ustus es domine / et omnia iudicia tua. Hou arthe iuste lorde / and all thy iudgementes are true / & all thy wayes mercy truth and iustyce. And now lorde remē∣bre me and take not vengeaunce of my synnes / nor thynke not on my offences / nor the syn̄es of my parentes. Bycause we haue not obeyed thy p̄ceptes therfore thou halte delyuered vs vp in to these euylles / in to confusyon & reproche and to be a fable to al peo∣ple and the gentles, and now lorde great be thy
iudgementes / for we haue not done accordynge to that preceptes / and we haue not walked pure¦ly before the. And now lorde: accordynge to thy pleasure do with me / and cheyfly receyue my spy rite in peace / for it is better for me to dye / then to lyue. ¶  ana me domine et sanabor. Eale me good lorde and I shal be healed saue me and I shall be saued / for my prayse ar te thou. Be not thou a feare vn∣to me / my hope art thou in the day of aflyccyon / let them be con founded that persue me / and let not me be confounded / let thē fea re / ad let not me feare put on thē the day of afflyccyon / and with double trouble / trouble them. ¶ ¶
