An APPENDIX TO HOLWEL'S Catastrophe Mundi, BEING An Astrological Discourse of the Rise, Growth and Continuation of the Othoman Family. With the Nativities of the present French King, Empe∣rors of Germany and Turky; All truly Rectifyed, and Astrologically handled. ALSO, What Progress this present Emperor of Turky shall make upon Europe in this Intended War with the House of Austria. Where unto is added a SƲPLIMENT of the Judgment of Comets. By JOHN HOLWEL Teacher of the Mathemacicks and Astrology. London, Printed by J. G. for F. Smith, at the Elephant and Castle in Cornhil, 1683.
To all those that are truly Lovers of Astrology, and other Mathematical Learning through∣out all Europe. Most Worthy Sirs, IT being my Fate to bring into the World (a small Piece of the Conjuncti∣on of Saturn and Jupiter, Entituled Ca∣tastrophe Mundi) about six Months ago, wherein was a Method shewed how to lay o Foundation of Judging of future Events relating to Mundane Affairs; and finding it hath been kindly received by the Ingenious of this Age, I have attempted to write an Appendix thereto, wherein is laid down a Method how to handle Astrologically the Ori∣ginal of any Family; by which means may be discovered their several Impending Fates, and that from the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter. For it is known to all men, that all Families, Cities, and other things that had a Beginning, have been subject to Mu∣tations, and at last to Desolution; but the Antients have been very silent in Matters relating to this very Subject, insomuch
that I was at a stand which way was best to take; but considering the Beginning of Empires, Kingdoms, Cities and Families have their Original from the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter; for the better Satisfaction of the young Student, I have thought good to handle (in this small Piece) the Rise of the Empire of Turky, and have traced his Rise and Growth, with a great deal of Labour, quite through the Turkish History; and in the same man∣ner may other Empires be handled, if the Rise of them be but known, and from thence may the many Mutati∣ons of the World be discovered. All those that go about to Judge the Event of Europe from the Entrance of the Sun into any of the Cardinal Points, build their Judgment from very uncertain grounds, for that very Point is not fully determin∣ed by Astronomers; and I judge it as hard to got a true Figure of any of those Times, as it is to get a Figure of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter: as for Example: Mr. Richard Kirby, in his Votes Astrologicus, lately Published, tells us. That the Sun enter Aries upon the 10th. day of March, at 3 Hours 41 Min. A. M. And from thence he very
learnedly gives a Judgment of the Spring-Quarter for the year 1683: but according to Mr. Street, the Sun enters Aries but 21 Min. A. M. the same day; no less than 3 Hours 20 Min. difference: and most Astro∣nomers of our Age do agree, That the Sun's greatest Paralax is less than half a Minute, and so consequently Mr. Street to be the near∣est the truth. Now I leave it to the Sons of Art to judge, what sure Ground any Ar∣tist can have to draw his Judgment from any of the Enerances of the Sun into the four Cardinal Points, seeing Astronomers dif∣fer so much: but what Mr. Kirby would have done for Matter to finish his Astrolo∣gical Prophet, had it not been for my Ca∣tastrophe Mundi, I know not, for all the material Matter in my Judgment of Years he hath very fairly transcribed. There is also Emitted into the World a small Piece, bearing the Title of Catastro∣phe Mundi, performed by a very Learned Pen; wherein the Author was pleased, in his Preface, to tell the World, That I had con∣fused the Hierogliphicks; under pretence of placing of them right. And yet this Learned Pen after all, confesses, That they were not placed right in Mr. Lillie's Time. From
whence I had the Key of placing of them right, is best known to my self. How∣ever I have been so kind to the Sons of Art, as to emit them into the World rightly placed; but the Learned Pen would do well to let the Gentleman have his Book again from whence he had all his Catastrophe Mundi out of, for it is a great piece of In∣gratitude not to restore it. Worthy Sirs, the Thing it self will speak what pains I have been at to compose it, there being no President in this kind as ever I could light of, which Labour and Pains I present to the World, hoping the Lovers of Art of this Age will judge of it according to its Merits, which if it be kindly accepted by you, will be all the Reward that I shall expect. In the mean time, Farewell. From my House on the East-side of Spittle-Fields, over against Dorset-Street, next Door to a Glasiers. May 9th. 1683 John Holwel.
The Proeme GReat have been the Mutations of the World since it hath pleased the Eternal Being to lay the Foundation thereof; among which are reckon∣ed several great Monarchs or Empires that have been erected and continued for several hundreds of years; but yet at the last had their time of Destruction, by whose Fall there were new Ones erected: as for Example, 1258 years before the comming of Christ, is said to begin the Persian Monarchy; and that was under the Influence of the Con∣junction of Saturn and Jupiter in Virgo; that Conjuncti∣on happening the same year: and this Monarchy continued in its Ebbing and Flowing 810 years; at which time be∣gan the Grecian Monarchy; and 7 years before the be∣ginning of the Grecian Monarchy there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Taurus; and this Monarchy con∣tinued in its Ebbing and Flowing near 405 years; at which time there did happen a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scorpio, which did destroy the Grecian, and lay the Foundation of the Roman Monarchy; which Monar∣chy hath continued with its Ebbing and Flowing ever since. But that which is worth our taking notice of, is, that the next time that Saturn and Jupiter made their last Conjunction in Gemini the Bishops of Rome claimed to themselves the unlimited Title of Supremacy, it being the same time that Mahomet established his Opinions, and as they had their Rise together, so will they have their Fall. The Sub∣ject Matter of these following Sheets being to shew the Rise
of that famous Empire of Turky, and the several Mutati∣ons of it, and how far they may inlarge their Territories in Europe, and how long that Empire may continue in the Othoman Family; and likewise at what time it may be ex∣pected that they may change their Religion to Christiani∣ty, and consequently the Fall of Antichrist; all which being the Subject Matter of an Astrological Discourse of the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 1285, which was the Conjunction that preceded the Rise of the Othoman Family, and likewise of that Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagit. that preceded the Preaching of the Gospel, which happened in the 14th. year of Christ; and also of that Con∣junction of Saturn and Jupiter that preceded the coming of Mahomet, the Saviour of the Turks, and the Suprema∣cy of the Popes of Rome; from which Conjunctions not only the Causes of this mighty Empires Ebbing and Flowing, but also the Ebbing and Flowing of Christianity, and like∣wise the Ebbing and Flowing of Mahometism, and also the Change of that Opinion to Christianity; will I hope bring great Content to all the Sons of Art.
CHAP. I. Of the Rise of the Nation of the Turks, and under what Constellation they had their Beginning. THE Turks were a sort of People called Scythians, that left their Native Country in the Year of our Lord 844: under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the fiery Sign Leo and did seat them selves in Armenia after a Rude manner, until Tangrolipix was sent by the Turks with 3000 Men to the aid of Mahomet the Sul∣tan of Persia: and in a year or two after he was chosen himself (by the Souldiers) Sultan of Persia in the Year of our Re∣demption 1030: this was under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Taurus: Tangrolipix was chosen Sultan of Persia three years after the Conjunction it self: the next time that Saturn and Jupiter made their Conjunction in Taurus the Turks had a great War with the Christians: Jerusalem is taken by the latter, and Godfrey Duke of Bullon made King thereof by consent of the Christian Army; and when Saturn and Jupiter made their last Conjunction in the Earthy Triplicity, Viz. Virgo: Jerusalem was again Re-taken by Saladin the Sultan of the Turks, and under the same Conjunction, Viz. In the year 1202 the Turks were drove out of Persia by the Tar∣tars, and were forced to settle their Kingdom in lesser Asia, at Sebastia and Ivontum: and when Saturn and Jupiter made the first Conjunction in Libra after their entance in the Airy Tri∣plicity, the Turks were driven out of Aegypt by the Mamilukes
in the year 1250 five years after the Conjunction, and they set up a Kingdom of themselves, which Kingdom continu∣ed for the space of 267 years; at which time they were (Viz. in the year 1517, and nine years after the sixth Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Selymus the victorious Emperour of the Turks) overthrown, and the Kingdom of Aegypt, with all Syria and the Land of Pa∣lestine brought into the Form of Provinces, united unto the Turks Empire. At the same time that the Turks King∣dom was Founded by Tangropipix in Persia, was also another Kingdom of theirs at the City of Machan, but nothing compa∣parable to the other either in Glory or Power. At the time of the Turks being driven out of Persia by the Tar∣tar, one Solyman Reigned at Maehan, and was also driven out of his Kingdom: this Solyman was not of the same Fa∣mily of Tangropipix, but was of the Oguzian Tribe, this Soly∣man and his Oguzian Turks wandred till they came to Eu∣phrates, where Solyman, by endeavouring to find a Passage, was there drowned; he left behind him four Sons, Sencur, Teken Jundogdis, and Ertogrul, the Father of Othoman the Founder of the Turks Empire that now is, and Dunder. This Dunder and his Brother Ertogrule, with four hundred Families, stayed by the River, at a Place called Pasin-Ovasi, while the other two Brethren and the rest of the Turks passed the River, and return∣ed again into Persia: this Ertogrul having three Sons, Viz. Jundus, Serugatius and Othoman, sent his second Son Serugatius to Aladin, to desire him to let him have a Corner of his Coun∣try that wanted Peopling to rest in; which Request was grant∣ed, and after a short time, for some good Service that this Er∣togrul had done the Sultan Aladin, gave him and his Turks a Country Village called Sugata, in the greater Phrygia, and so continued these Turks for a small time, still increasing, until Ertogrul, after he had Governed the Oguzian Families 52 years, dyed in the Year of our Lord 1289: after whose Death the Oguzian Turks chose Othoman to be their Governour; as may be seen by any who please to peruse the Turkish History.
CHAP. II. Of the Astrological Judgment of the Continua∣tion of the Othoman Family. OThoman, after the death of his Father, taking upon him the Government of the Oguzian Turks in the year 1689, we are to consider under what Constellation he Founded this great Empire. The last Conjunction that was of Saturn and Jupiter was in Aquarius, four years be∣fore: and his Father Ertogrul began to govern the Oguzian Turks under the Gubernation of Saturn and Jupiter in Aquarius, the year of our Lord 1237; the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter happening in the year 1226, eleven years before. But forasmuch as Othoman is accounted to be the be∣ginning of this Family of the Turks, it will be needful that we consider the Conjunction that happened in 1285, on the 11th. day of December, at 18 2 P. M. being the time of the New Moon, proceding, for which, and for Constantinople, it being in the Lat. of 43 Deg. and by reason it is 2 H. 18 to the East∣ward of London, therefore the time there will be 20 H. 20 P. M. for which time the Figure following was set. 10 House ♏ 4 45 4 House ♉ 4 45 11 House ♏ 25.30 5 House ♉ 25 30 ☋ 1 2 ☊ 1 2 12 House ♐ 14.10 6 House ♊ 14 10 ☉ ☽ in ♐ 27 40   Ascendant ♑ 8 7 7 House ♋ 8 7. ♀ in ♑ 12 52   ☿ in ♑ 18 4   ♈ in ♒ 4 20   ♄ in ♒ 4 35   ♒ 23 50 Second 8 House  27 50   ♐ in ♍ 3 39 3 House 4 10 ♈ 9 House ♎ 4 10 From this very Fi∣gure any one that is but meanly versed in the Art of Astrology, may know that Aqua∣rius is a fixed Sign, and that Saturn doth wholly take delight therein, and he doth dispose of three of the Planets, Viz. Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury; and Jupiter doth dis∣pose of both the Sun and Moon, and Mer∣cury
doth dispose of Mars; all Astrologers do allow Saturn to represent all Staple Monarchs, because he very seldom applys to any of the Planets, but geally all the other Planets to him, and seeing we find him in this Conjunction in Aqua∣rius, the more staple will that Monarch be that is represented by him, and forasmuch as the Othoman Family had their Rise soon after this Conjunction; therefore we shall take Saturn as he is placed in Aquarius, to represent that Family, then will Taurus, upon the Cusp of the fifth, represent his People that he shall Govern, and Leo upon the Cusp of the eighth, will, according to Astrology, represent his publick Enemies, and Capricorn his own House, and Mercury and Venus his private Enemies, and Taurus upon the Cusp of the fourth, and Sagit∣tarius upon the twelfth with the Sun and Moon will represent his Neighbours and Allies. Now all these Places that are un∣der Aquarius, Leo, Taurus and Virgo will feel the heavy hand of this Monarchy; and seeing that this Empire from such small beginning hath risen to such vast Territories, it will be necessary that we should consider the continual Increase there∣of, and also to enquire from what Constellations they have had their several Mutations, and that the young Artist may not be left in the dark, I have directed all the five Helogia∣cal places of this Figure that preceded the Rise of this Family to the year of our Lord 1720; and in order to the better En∣quiry I have traced all the material Accidents that have attend¦ed this Family to the year 1640, out of the Turkish History, which I hope will give great satisfaction to the young Artist as well as it hath done to me.

CHAP. III. Of the Increase of the Empire, and under what Constellation they have had their several Mutations. AFter Othoman having settled his little Common Wealth, the first direction that the Empire had, was the Sun to the Body of Venus, she being in Capricorn, and this fell in the year of our Lord 1300; in this year did Othoman take Nice, and Seated himself in a City called Ne∣apolis, and took upon himself Regal Power. In this year, and the year before, the Conjunction 1308 it self came to the Sextile of both Sun and Moon, and Mars came also by direction to the Conjunction it self; and also in the year 1305 Saturn and Jupiter made their first Conjunction in Libra, the Exaltation of Saturn during of these 20 year, the Turk, by the division of the Greek Empire, gaining footing in Europe, gained many Battles, but was invited into Europe by the Cattalonians, the Island of Rhodes was taken from the Turk. in the year 1308. In the year 1324 Saturn & Jupiter made their second Con∣junction of the Rise of this Kindom in Gemini in Trine to the place of the Conjunction 1285: three years after this Prusa, one of the great Cities of Asia yielded to Othoman, and he makes it his Royal Seat, and the year after Othoman himself died, and his Son Orchanus Succeeds, during of whose Reign he had good success, but not upon Europe; he takes Carasi∣ina and Callipolis, and Nicomedia, and dyed in the year of our Lord 1359; and his Son Amurath the first began to Reign.
In the year 1264 you will find in my Catastrophe Mundi, that Saturn and Jupiter made their fourth Conjunction in Libra, during which Conjunction Boga is taken by Amurath, and so is Didymaticum, and is again recovered by the Christians, and demolished; and was again new builded by the Turk. Ser∣via is also invaded by Amurath: Missa and Apollonia won by him also in the year 1387, three years after the fifth Conjuncti∣on of Saturn and Jupiter in Gemini. Amurath had Asia invad∣ded by Aladin his Son in Law, and in the year 1390 was stab'd by a wounded Souldier, and Bajazet began to Reign. Bajazet soon after his coming to the Crown invades Servia twice in one year; in the year 1396 was fought a great Battle between Bajazet and the Christians, where of the Turks were slain 60000, and of the Christians 20000: and the year after, Viz. 1397 was the great Battle between Tamberlen and Ba∣jazet, whereof were no less than 400000 Turks and Tartars slain, and Bajazet taken and put into a Iron Cage, and carryed through all Asia. Bajazet beats out his Brains in the year 1399; the mean time Tamberlen' conquers all Asia and Aegypt, and all the Turks Territories, and all in five years; he dies in the year 1202 at Samarcand in the year 1405, but one year after the first Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Piscis, and the sixth Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter since the Rise of this Family began Mahomet the first, he having a great deal of trou∣ble by reason of his Brothers striving who should have the Crown. This short Reign of Tamberline is worth our taking notice of, he beginning his Conquest under the influence of the Conjunction in Gemini, and the last of that Triplicity, and so soon as Saturn and Jupiter made their first Conjunction in Piscis, the Conjunction being in Square, to the Conjunction that went before, and in Sextile to the Conjunction that pre∣ceded the Rise of this Family; that made that Family begin to settle it self again, and gained in a small time all that Tam∣berlen had taken from Bajazet, this twentieth year was spent in the Civil War between Mahomet and his Brother Musa and Solyman, and he died in the year 1422, he Reigned but seven years over his Fathers Territories, and 10 years was he gaining of them: he left his Son Amurath the second to Reign in his stead.
From the year 1424 to the year 1432 the Turks attempt Prore, but in vain, for Mustapha, the supposed Son of Bajazet raiseth Rebellion against Amurath, he in vain besieged Constan∣tinople, but in the year 1432 he takes Thessalonia. A great Plague among the Turks, Hungaria wasted, Belgrade is besieged, and the Turks forced to draw off with great loss during the time of the Influence of this Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in it, falling in exact square to the Conjunction that precedes their Rise, he got but little but the Slaughter of his Men; but in the year 1444 there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Ju∣piter in Cancer. After this year the Turks grew Victorious, Transilvania and Valachia invaded and spoiled by the Turk, the great Battle between Amurath and the King Ʋladistance, the Christians lost the day, after the Christians break the Truce with the Turks; in the year 1445 Greece was made. Tributa∣ry to the Turks; in the year 1448 was the great Battle be∣tween Amurath and Huniades, where most part of the Hun∣garian Nobility, with 57000 Turks and Christians were slain. In the year 1450 Amurath died, and Mahomet the first Em∣perour, but the second of that Name, began to Reign; in the year, 1453 Constantinople was taken by the Turk, and also the Country of Servia. In the year 1456 Huniades obtained a great Victory against the Turks, that being but two years after the Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter from Virgo and Taurus, both of them cast∣ing their hateful Square to the Sign Aquarius, the place of the Conjunction at the Rise of the Othoman Family, Mahomet the same time being wounded and carryed away for dead. In the year 1464 there was a Conjunction of Saturn & Jupiter in Piscis, in this year Mahomet invades Epirus, & Scanderbeg, doth destroy a great many of the Turks, and: until Scanderbeg died, Mahomet could not get any thing by invading of that Country. Scanderbeg died in the year 1466, and from that time till 1470 the Turks did not prosper, for Mathias King of Hungaria took the Kingdom of Bosna from the Turks in the year 1469; but in the year 1470 Chalcis and the chief City of Euhoa were taken by the Turks, but yet the Venetian and the great Master of the Rhodes did great harm along the Coast of lesser Asia:
In the year 1478 Scodra was taken by the Turk after a years. Siege; and in the year 1481 Mahomet was poisoned, and Ba∣jazet began his Reign. In the year 1484 there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Ju∣piter in Virgo, in Square to the Conjunction that preceded their Rise: during the time of the Operation of this Con∣junction the Turk did not prosper at all, for the Mama∣lukes in Aegypt gained great Victory against him, and he at last was poisoned in the year 1512, there being a Con∣junction of Saturn and Jupiter nine years before in Can∣cer and the Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter was a hasten∣ing from Virgo and Tanrus, both of them being in Square to the Conjunction precede the Rise of the Family. Selymus his Son Reigned In his stead. In the year 1250 began the Kingdom of the Mamalukes in Aegypt, under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Li∣bra; and under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Can∣cer, Selymus drove the Mamalukes out of Aegypt, the Con∣junction was in the year 1503; and in the year 1517 was the Downfall of the Mamalukes. In the year 1520 died Selymus, and his Son Solymon began to Reign: and in the year 1521 Belgrade was won by Soly∣man. And in the year 1522 the Island of Rhodes was also ta∣ken by Solymon. There was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Piscis in the year 1525. Solymon invaded Hungaria; and in the year 1526 the King of Hungaria was drowned in a Dith; and in the same year the Vavod of Transilvania chosen King of Hun∣garia; and in the year 1528 King John was driven out of Hun∣garia by Fardinando; and is himself Crowned King at Alba Re∣gulis; and in 1529 Solymon came again into Hungaria with a great Army, and takes Buda without Resistance, and spoiles Austria, Attenburgh taken, and Solyman besieges Vienna, but is forced to raise the Siege with the loss of eighty thousand men; but Solymon restored King John to the Kingdom of Hungaria. In the year 1532 Solyman cometh again into Hungaria, and sends 15000, men under the Command of Cason to spoil Austria! A great Blazing Star seen.
In the year 1523 the Turk besieged Carone, but was beat off. In the year 1537 King Ferdinand breaks League with Solymon, but got little by it but the loss of the Christians. In the year 1540 King Ferdinand invades Hungaria, and takes Vicgrod: and in the year 1541 the Queen of Hungaria joyn∣eth with the Turk, and burns Vacia, and takes Buda; and So∣lymon craftily detains the Nobles of Hungaria in his Camp, and converts the Kingdom of Hungaria to a Province of the Turkish Empire; and in the year 1543 Alba Regulus is taken: In that year there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Virgo, in square to the Conjunction that preceded the Rise of the Family; from that year to the year 1563 the Empire had but little Success; but in the year 1563 there was a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Cancer: and in the year 1566 there doth arise new troubles in Hungaria: Solymon dyes of the Bloody-Flux at the Siege of Sigeth, and Selymus Succeeds. In the year 1570 Nicosia and Cyren was taken by the Turk: and in the Year 1571 the Turks take Cyprus: and in this year was that famous Fight at Lepanto by Don John of Austria. In the year 1574. Maldavia and Valachia taken by the Turk; Selymus dyes, and Amurath Succeeds. In 1575 Amurath invadeth Poland, burned and destroyed two hundred Noblemens Houses, besides a number of Towns and Villages; and in the year 1577 they conclude a Peace again; and from this year to the year 1592 he bends all his Forces a∣gainst Persia, and that way doth increase the Territories very much. And in the year 1592 Amurath invades Croatia, and takes Sisog and in the year 1595 Amurath died, and Mahomet the third succeeded; and from this year 1595 the Christians be∣gan to get ground of the Turks; for in the year 1596 was a great Plague and Famine in Hungaria among the Turks; and in the year 1598 Transilvania submitteth to the Empe∣rour. And also in the year 1596 was Strigonum and Vicegrade taken from the Turk by the Christians, and also the Turks in∣vade Valacha, and ar forced to fly by the Christians. In the years 1597 and 1598 the Turk hath no Success, but
the Christians gain ground of them; and in the year 1600 Al∣ba Regulus was taken by the Christians. But in the year 1602 Alba-Regulus was again taken by the Turks, and the Christians take Pesth, and a many more Places; and in the latter end of 1603 Mahomet. III. dyed, and his Son Achmat succeeds; and soon after the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagittarius, 1603 the Persian gains ground of the Turk, and there is great Trouble in Transil∣vania. And in the year 1605 the Turks take Strigonium, but the Persians gain ground upon the Turk, and there was for these two years a great Rebellion in Hungaria. In the year 1606 there was a Peace between the German Emperour and the Sultan of Turky. In the year 1611 a great Plague in Constantinople, where∣of dyed 200000 Persons. In the year 1617 the Sultan Achmat dyed, and Mustapha Succeeds, but is soon deposed, and Osman began at the age of sixteen years. But in the year 1622 Mustapha is again re-inthroned, and Osman strangled by Daout Bassa. In the year 1623. Mustapha is again deposed, and Morat at the age of fourteen years began to Reign, during whose Reign he looses all he had in Persia, and was very much afflicted with Troubles: and all these things precede the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Leo, six De∣grees in Opposition to the great Conjunction in 1285, in five Degrees of Piscis.
CHAP. IV. Of the General Judgment Astrological of the further State of the Empire of the Turks, and what Countries of Europe will be most Passive. BUt that we may begin our Work from some certain Epoche of time, and not involve our selves into a La∣borinth of unnecessary Enquiries. We are to consider, that there is no material Accident either in Empires or Kingdoms which first of all had not a Beginning from some Radix. Therefore with great diligence the first Roots or Foundations of things are to be inquired into. And therfore by an Inquiry we sind the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Aquarius to proceed the Rise of this Mighty Mo∣narch, which in the year 1285, we shall make the Root of this, and for that reason have I set a Figure for the Now-Moon preceding  Now if we make the Place of the Con∣junction it self to be the Degree Ascending, and set the Figure for Constantinople, you will find Mars to be the Lord of the tenth House; which doth represent the Honour and Grandure of the Empire, and Mars doth represent his Soul∣diers, and that by the Sword he should maintain and gain all his Reputation Now Mars being placed in Virgo, under which Sign Authors tell us is Achaia, Greece, Creet, Croatia, Corinthia, Anthesina, the Dukedom of Athens, Mesopotamia, Babylon, Assyria, Gallia, Silesia: Cities, Hierusalem, Corinth, Rhodes, Popia, Signia, Brundusium, Aretium, Novaria, Tholosa, Lyons, Paris, Basil, Heidleburg, Erphord, Wratislavi. Besides a many more Places which Authors have not allotted to this
Sign, as yet we sind by experience that a great many of these Places already are annexed to this Empire. Likewise those Places that are in Sextile or Trine to the place of Mars at the time of this Conjunction, will also go nigh to be in subjection to him: all those places of the Zodiack that are in the Sextile, is Cancer and Virgo; and those places that are in the Trine, are Taurus and Capricorn. Now under Can∣cer are said to be Scotland, Granado, Burgundy. Holland, Ze∣land, Prussia, Numidia, Africa, Bithinia, Chadchis, Carthage. Cities under, are Constantinople, Venice, Tunis, Genoa, Lucas, Pisa, Millaine, Berne, York, St. Andrew in Scotland, Lubeck, Megdeburg, Wittenburg, Gorlick. Under Virgo are Norway, Upper Bavaria, Matagony, Como∣gena, Cappadocia, Idumia, Mauritania, Fez, Gethulia, Catalonia, Cities are, Algiers, Valentia in Spain, Trabezone, Ʋrbine, Pesto∣rium, Aquilegia, Camerinum, Tarvisum, Forum, Julium, Mas∣sana, Vienna. Alehstade, Monachum, Gaunt, Frankford upon Odor. A great many of these Places hath he already got, and the rest will suffer by him in a short time. Under Taurus are Russia, Polonia, Great Swedeland, the North part, Lorraign, Campania, Helvetia, Rhetia, Franconia, Parthia, Persia, Ireland, Cyclades, the Island of Cyprus, and the Sea Towns of Lesser Asia: Of Cities, Bononia, Sona, Matua, Tarentum, Panorme in Sicily, Peruficum, Caput Histria, Brixi, Zurich, Lucerne, Nants, Herbibolis, Caroltade, Posnania, Lip∣zig, Gnesna, Novograde. Besides a many more places. Under Virgo are Macedonia, Illyria, Thracia, Bosina, Albania, Bulgaria, part of Greece, Muscovia, Lituania, Saxony, Hassia, Thuringia, Marchia, Stiria, Orchades, India, Ariana, Gedra∣sia: Of Cities, Oxford, Mechlin, Juliacum, Berga, Branden∣burg, Austusta, Vindelicorum, Constance, Derthona, Faventia: So likewise all those Places that are in Square and Opposition to Virgo, will meet with great Devastation by the force of this Empire. The Places that are in Square, are Gemini and Sagit∣tarius. Now if we may believe the Antient, they tell that un∣der Sagittarius are Spain, Dalmatia, Sclavonia, Hungary, Mora∣via, Misnia, Celtia, Thirronia, Arabia the happy: Of Cities, Toledo, Voleteras, Mutina, Narbon, Avinion, Colonia, Agrippina, Studgard, Rotenburg, Buda, Gascovia.
And under Gemini are, according to Authors, part of Lum∣berdy, part of England, Flanders, Brabant, and the Dukedom of Wertenburgh, Hircania, Armenia, Martiania, Cyrenia, Marma∣rica, Aegypt the Lower: Of Cities, London, Corduba in Spain, Viturbium, Cecenam, Turny, Vercellas, Rhegium, Lovain, Bruges in Flanders, Mentz Kitzing, Hosford, Bamberge, Villacum, No∣rimberg. And under Piscis, the opposite Sign to Virgo, are according to Authors, Cilicia, Calabriana, Portugal, Galicia, Normandy, Phasimia, Nosomonia in Libia, Garamantes, Lydia, Phamphilia, and Higher Aegypt: Of Cities, Alexandria, Hispolis, Com∣postella, Parentium, Rhimes, Worms, Ratispont. So likewise not only all those Places that are under the Signs that Mars doth behold, but all those Places that the place of the Conjuction doth behold, and that is Aquarius, Libra, Leo, Aries. Under Aquarius the Place of the Conjunction are Amazonia, Sarmatia, Great Tartary, Valachia, Muscovia, the South part of Swedeland, Westphalia, Mosel, Piedmont, part of Bavaria, Ethiopia, Oxiania, Sogdiana, Media, Arabia, Desert and Stony: Of Cities, Hambourough, Breme, Mountferate, Pisarum, Trent, Salizburgh, Ingolstade. Under Leo is Galla, Fagata, the Alps, Italy, Sicily, Apalia, Bohemia, part of Turky, Aemilia, Sabina, Phenicia, Chaldea, Orchinia: Of Cities, Demasco, Syracuse, Rome, Rovenna, Cre∣mona, confluente, Prague, Liniz, Crimisicum. Under Libra are Austria, Alsatia, Livoia, Sabandia, Delphi∣nat, Bastrina, Thusia Seres, Caspia, Thebadu, Olsim, Trogloditica, Sundgavia: Of Cities, Lisbon, Cajetam, Laudam, Suessam, Placentia, Felkirch, Friburg, Argentine, Spiers, Frankford at Mane Holam, Suenorum, Wimpina, Heibran, Frisings, Mospa∣chiam, Laudshut, Vienna in Austria, Antwerp. And under Aries are said to be England, France, Germany in general, Higher Silesia, part of Polonia, Burgundy, Denmark, Basternia, Syria, Palestine: Cities, Naples, Capua, Ancona, Farrara, Florence, Verona, Bergano, Lindaw, Ʋtrecht, Pa∣dua, Marcelles, Epidaure, Crackow, Augustam, Caragosa, Wenieca.
It is very well worth our noting, that the Conjunction and the place of Mars doth behold all the twelve Signs: but it cannot be expected that the Turk should have all the Places that are under the twelve Sings; but he will go night to have all those Places that had their beginning under the Influence of Saturn and Jupiter when they were conjoyned, in four, five, or six Degrees of any of them, because those parts both Mars Saturn and Jupiter do behold all round. Now any one that will be but pleased to consider all of the Conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter is any of the Sigus since the Rise of this Family, you will find that these Places have been the greatest Sufferers, that had their Signs beholding the place of Mars by any bad Aspect in the Conjunction that pre∣ceded the Rise of that Family. And seeing that great Expectations of the Turks Mo ion into Eundpe upon the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 1682 and 1683, we olight to consider how the Figure of this Conjunction doth sympathise with the Conjunction that was the Rise of the Family; the Figures of the Conjunction you may see in my Ca∣tastrophs Mundi. Now if we place the Conjunction it self upon the Cusp of the Ascendant, and set the Figure for Constantino∣ple, you will find Mars to be upon the Radical place of Mars in the Conjunction in 1285, and there doth make a very quick passage through that Sign: and before the second Conjuncti∣on in 168/3 in January, Mars will have got into Libra, and there doth make a long and tedious transite, no less than eight Months; and all the while he passes through Libra he doth af∣flict Capricorn, Cancer and Aries besides the Sign he passes through; by his Passage through Libra he doth threaten Au∣stria with great Devastation, and also the taking of Vienna it self, and the general Conquest of the East Part of Germany, and almost all those Places that are in Christendom under Libra, Aries, Capricorn, and Cancer, about five Degrees there∣of. And that the young Artist may be able to give a reason∣able Conjecture of Mars's long transit through Libra, it will be convenient to set a Figure for the New Moon preceding the second Conjunction, because at that time the Sun was Eclips∣ed,
and the middle of that Ecclipse fell at London, by the best Tables, at 4 hours 35 minutes post Meridiem: and at Vienna. in Austria at 5 hours 40 minutes post Meridiem, and in the La∣titude of 48 degrees 22 minutes was this following Figure set. 10 House ♉ 7 45 4 House ♏ 7 45     11 House ♊ 20 5 House ♐ 20     12 House ♋ 25 30 6 House ♑ 25 30   ☿ in ♒ 1 0 ☊ in ♌ 15 00 ☉ ☽ 8 d. 10 m. ♒ ♄ in ♌ 17 57 ☋ in ♒ 15 ♃ in ♌ 18 38 ♀ 18 12 ♒ ℞ Aseendant ♌ 20 7 House ♒ 20     2 House ♍ 11 10 House ♓ 11 10     House ♎ 4 50 House ♈ 4 50 ♂ in ♎ 23 11   The rea∣son that I set this figure for Vienna in Au∣stria, is be∣cause that Sa∣turn and Ju∣pirer are near then arising in their Ho∣rison when the Sun suf∣fers, the greatest de∣fect, and at that very same time both Sun and Moon and Mercury are in Square to the Sign of the 10th. House, and Venus, Lady of the 10th. House is in Opposition to the Con∣junction it self, and is Retrograde also, and doth run so far: backward in the Sign she is in, until she doth come to be in Square to the 10th House also, and then doth transit the place of the Ecclipse with a Conjunction, and when she is become di∣rect again, meet both with Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter. All these things are very well worth any Artist's taking notice of; by which he may find what is a coming upon that part of
Christendom. Now it is allowed by all that have any knowledge in Astrology, that the Ascendant of an Ecclipse doth repre∣sent the commonality of People, if so, you will find Sol the Lord thereof to be Ecclipsed by the Moon, Lady of the twelfth House, what can be expected from thence, but that those sort of People inhabiting in those East Parts of Germany, should come to have great calamity fall upon them, and that by a Lunar sort of People. Now the Moon in the great Conjunction preceding the Rise of the Othoman Family, is Lady of the sixth House, and by that meanes doth represent the Subjects and Vassals of that Family; and in this Conjunction, Ecclipsing the Sun not far from the opposite Place of that Conjunction, doth declare, ac∣cording to Art, that they shall over run all those Places of Germa∣ny, that had Leo arising at the middle time of the Ecclipse, and all those Countries that are under Leo, Aquarius, Taurus and Scorpio, and likewise will overthrow all those Monarchs that have their Rise or Foundation under the Influence of a Conjunction of Sa∣turn and Jupiter in Leo, Taurus and Scorpio: but those Places will first have their share of Suffering that are under Aquarius, the place of the Ecclipse: among which places, let Valachia and the South Part of Poland beware; neither shall Muscovia be free, but shall tast part of the bitter Cup that is allotted for Europe to tast. Mars making of his long transit in Libra, tells us that Austria shall be much wasted, and the People thereof be brought very low, and a great part of them will be carried Captive, and their great Town Vienna will go near to be lost; and the Seat of War will last longer in Austria than in any other part of Germany. The Moon and Sun and the Conjuncti∣on it self being in Square to Taurus, doth declare that Poland should be much wasted by both Turk and Tartar, for this Con∣junction is in Square to the eleventh House of that Kings Electi∣on, and the Ecclipses fall in the second; and Mercury, Lord of the seventh House at the time of his Election, is in this Ecclipse in Square to his tenth; and Mars, Lord of the tenth, is in Li∣bra weak; this bids Poland to be very careful how he doth go to War during the time that this Conjunction is alot∣ted to operate, which will be near twenty years; for if he doth fall to War with either Turk ot Tartar, he must expect to gain
nothing but the Devastation of his fruitful Country, with the destruction of his People, if not the bazard of the Crown and Dignity of that Kingdom. Neither will the Swede be in a better condition, for if he doth go to War with any of his Neighbours, he will receive great damage by it, if not lose part of his Coun∣try. And by reason of Mars being placed in Virgo at the time of the first of the three Conjunctions, and did make a swift pas∣sage through that Sign: this doth declare that Croatia should be one of the first Places that the Turks should bring under their Subjection, and will make great waste in that Province, and car∣ry the People Captive. And because Mars at that time he was in Virgo, did cast his hateful Square to the Sign Sagittarius, doth declare according to Art, that Hungaria shall suffer much by the Turks, and shall by them be made desolate in those parts next Moravia, and they will bring that Kingdom under their Subjection in a short time. Moravia being under Sagittarius, must expect to have a great share of the Turks Invasion, and a great many of thy Towns and Cities will be laid waste, and a great scarcity of Corn will be in those Parts, by reason of the Raging of Ar∣mies. Neither will Slavonia be free from the Calamity of hot Neigh∣bours; for the Great Turk shall make his Way into Italy that way, and shall bring under his Yoke that Country, and will car∣ry the People into Bondage. And by reason that Saturn and Jupiter make a Triple Con∣junction in the Sign Leo, doth declare that the Turk should ad∣vance his Forces into Bohemia, and shall there do grent damage; he will lay waste all the Monasteries, and will carry the Priests into perpetual Bondage. It doth grieve my heart to think what great Calamity will fall upon that Kingdom. Under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Leo was the last Bohemian War, which caused that Place to indure most sad Calamity: but those that were the Cause of that Evil in those days, will all of them be brought to destruction, that there will not be so much as one Nest for those Unclean Birds left: Oh!
the many years of great Scarcity that shall full upon that Place, occasioned by the Devastation that is like to be by War. This Triple Conjunction being in Leo, falls in Square to Scor∣pi this doth bid the Duke of Bavaria look to his Country, for the Turk is like to invade him with a very great Army, and will lay waste a great part of his Territories, and joyn it to the rest of his Conquest. And Mars being posited in Virgo at the first time of the three Conjunctions, doth foreshew that the Dukedom of Wittenburgh shall have the Turk to Range in his Bowels, and make great Devastation; at which time the Crown of France, will begin to shake for fear, and wish that he was a little farther from him; but it will be in vain, for the Turk will invade his new Conquest in Alsatia, and from thence pass through Lorrain into France, and take Burgundy in the twinkling of an eye; all the seventeen United Provinces sub∣mit to his Protection without being invaded, and by so doing save their Country from Fire and Sword: and at the same time the Turk is so Victorious in the South-West Parts of Germany; Another part of his vast great Army will Range in the North and North-West Parts thereof, and pass through Bohemia, and enter Franconia, and from thence he will invade both Higher and Lower Saxony, even as far as the North Parts thereof: it will seem strange to hear that the Turk should be got so far into Ger∣many as Westphalia, and the Country of Juliers, but so it will be, and God's Will must be done. Germany was first conquer∣ed by the Romans, under the Influence of a Conjunction of Sa∣turn and Jupiter in Scorpio; and the Empire of the Romans was Erected under the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scorpio; this Conjunction falls in Square to that, and this Ecclipse falls in Square to that also, and the Ecclipse being the Lunation be∣fore the second Conjunction of Saturn and Jupitor, January, 1682/3 this will cause that Empire to have a very great Shake, if not totally subverted to the Power of the Othoman Family: and seeing that there is such great Preparation on all Sides for a great War with the Turk, it will be needful for us to con∣sider the Nativity of this present Emperour of Germany, and there to see what Directions he hath. This present Emperour of Germany was Borr the 30th. day of May, Old Stile, 1640, at
nine Hours 3 Minutes post Meridiem, in the Latitude of 48 Degrees. The Figute is as followeth. M C in ♏ 7 42 4 House in ♉ 7 42 ☊ in ♏ 28 17 ♀ in ♉ 21 48   ☋ in ♉ 28 17   ☿ in ♉ 28 52 11 House in ♏ 26 16 5 House in ♉ 26 16     12 House in ♐ 13 17 6 House in ♊ 13 17   ☉ in ♊ 19 17 ♃ in ♑ 4 54   Ascendant ♑ 6 20 7 House ♋ 6 20     2 House ♒ 17 8 House ♌ 17 ♂ in ♒ 22 23   ♄ 0 58 in ♓   ☽ 2 24 in ♓   3 House in ♈ 7 30 9 House ♎ 7 30 This Nativity was rectified by the M.C. to the Square of Saturn and Jupiter and Square of the Moon; at which time the Empe∣rour had great Suffering both to himself and Em∣pire, for the Turk did invade him: also at the same time he had his Moon by directi∣on to the Square of Jupiter.

Thus have you the Nativity of this mighty Monarch truly Rectified; and any one that will but take the Pains to run down all the Direction, will find them to agree very well. The next thing will be for us to inquire what Direction this Emperour hath now operating. The first is the Mid-heaven by direction to the Opposition of the Sun, and the Ascendant of the Body of Saturn with Latitude, and the Body of the Moon without Latitude, and the Sun to the two Asses, and the Moon to the fourth House, and his part of Fortune to the Square of Mars and Opposition of Venus. All these Directions are enough to destroy any Man in the whole World; but what these Directions do signifie I leave to the Artist to con∣sider —And to welcome them in, the Turk is coming against him with a very great Army and (what the Event thereof will be we must wait upon time to de∣termine. And because the Turk doth give the Alarm to all Europe, it will be needful for us to consider that mighty Monarchs Genature also. He was Born on the Ist. of January 1641/2, 5 Hours 20 Minutes 12 Seconds A. M. and it was Rectified by the M. C. to the Sextile of the Sun, at which time he came to the Throne and Digni∣ty of his Ancestors, and the Figure for the Rectified time is as followeth.

C. of that Monarchs Nativity being by direction come to the Opposi∣tion of the Sun, Lord of his eighth House, the Opposition falls in the twelfth: this cannot but bring along with it a great deal of Evil; he looses all his Reputation on a sudden, the undoing of his Family, it bids him beware of being taken Prisoner this year by the Turk; which if he be, it will be a long Captivity, he will be out of Esteem among his Subjects, his Allies will prove unfaithful to him, which will be one chief Cause of his Ruine: the Ascendant of his Nativity is also come to the bo∣dy of Saturn; this will load his Body with Sickness, and also his Mind with trouble, he shall grow very discontented, because he sees all things go against him, he thrives in nothing that he takes in hand, and all those Princes that do joyn in Forces with him against the now Emperour of the Turks, will find, to their Cost, what it is to joyn with such an unfortunate Prince as he is like to be for some years, if not so long as he doth live: his Ascendant being also at the same time directed to the body of the Moon, portends great danger to his Person by Water; and it doth also declare that he shall travel from Place to Place; it will be a great wonder if he be not in danger of his Life in a slight by Water; the Sun also being then directed to the two As∣ses: hear what Mr. Lilly saith to such a direction; he tells us that those Persons that have such a direction, a soot should have a very unhealthful time of it, and bring a sharp Feaver along with it, the Native will be in danger of his Life by Gun-shot,
he loseth both Honour and Fortune at once, he should receive much damage by Souldiers, he will be in danger of a violent Death, or else condemned to perpetual Slavery; he hath also his part of Fortune directed at the same time to Square of Mars, and Opposition of Venus; this doth also bring along with it a great deal of loss in Estate and Goods: in short, never any man in this World ever had so many bad directions upon him at one time, but it was both the Ruine of him and his Family. And from these things I conclude that this will be a most unfor∣tunate War to the House of Astria, for they will but go nigh to lose all they have. Neither will the Kingdom of France escape the hands of the Turk, for he will lay waste a great many of his Florishing Ci∣ties, but it will be occasioned by his own Subjects, for his Op∣pression will be so great, that they will cause a great Rebellion in France, and when the Turk is in Germany they will invite them into France, and then wo to Italy and Spain, but seeing the Welfare of France as it now stands, depends upon the Victo∣riousness of this King now injoying the Crown thereof, let us make Inquiry into the Nativity of this Potent Monarch, Lewis the XIV. He was born the 4th. day of December, New-Stile, at nine Minutes twenty four Seconds after Midnight, in the Lati∣tude of 48.51. North. The Figure is as followeth.   ♄ in ♒ 1 3 M C in ♍ 10 8 4 House in ♓ 10 8 ☉ in ♍ 12 42   ☿ in ♍ 24 41   11 House in ♎ 10 13 5 House in ♈ 10 13 P.

Small-Pox at thirteen years od months, the Mid-heaven came to the Square of Mars, then he had troubles in France. Twenty years od months he had his Mid-heaven to the Sextile of Venus, and Sextile of the Moon, at which time he was Married. At twenty years nine months he had his Ascendant to Cor Scorpio, at which time he had a Violent Fea∣ver. Note also that the Poles of Position of the Sun and Moon and Pars Fortune are found by the Doctrine of Triangles.

to the Square of Mercury, Lord of the tenth and eighth Houses; this will aggrevate the Evil much, and will cause his Subjects to rebell against him, and he will be in danger of Fire or Gun∣shot; sometimes it doth signifie a danger of being stab'd: and forasmuch as Mars being Lord of the twelfth as well as the Ascendant, bids him beware of being taken Prisoner: and dur∣ing the time that this Direction is operating, the French King will be subject to have dangerous Falls from Horseback: and to back this Direction, he hath his Sun coming to the Square of Saturn Lord of the third in the year 1684: this is also a very bad Direction, and brings along with it a great deal of Infelici∣ty to him, a great Decay in his Fortune. Now about this time he looses all his former Honour both by Land and Sea, he will likewise undergo many Dangers, all that he will take in hand for above these seven years (if he should live so long, which I am perswaded he shall not) prospers ill; let him beware of be∣ing cheated of his Life about August next. If he lose his Life by any violent means, then any one may see there is some truth in Art; if he doth escape that time with his Life, he will be in great peril thereof; and if it be preserv∣ed, it will be but for a worser end, for he will become ei∣ther Banished or Imprisoned soon after; but whether by the Turk or his own Subjects I leave to time to determine; but sure I am, that he will become (if he doth escape with Life then) one of the miserablest Princes in Eu∣rope. Better would it have been for him to have been contented with what his Father left him, than to bring such Judgments upon his Head by his being so unjust. If he had but taken notice of what Mr. Lilly wrote in the year 1672 when he made his first Attempt upon Holland, he might have fared better than he is like to do. His Words are these, A certain kind of Astonishment, said he, shall surprise an active Potent of Europe, seeing neither his Actions of War or Peace suc∣ceed according to his projected Expectations, for he may know that their is an over ruling Power that can contradict all Politick Coun∣sels, when not grounded upon Equity. And this he ought to re∣member,
that he is not the Man ordained to give Laws to his Neighbouring Nations. Indeed he was a Man ordained to bring a great deal of Cala∣mity upon Europe in order to prepare Matter for one that shall be far greater than he. But were I to write the Calamity that is like to befall the French these succeeding years, it would take up a large Vo∣lumn; but this I will let them know, that the Commons of France will be in Arms in a short time against this present King; and I have good reason to believe that he, if he lives to see but two years, will be driven from his Seat by his own Subjects, and if he doth die before, as I believe he will, then the next King will be served so, and the Turk will invade his Countrey, and lay many of his Cities waste; the Protestants of France will joyn with the Turk in the doing of it, then will there be great Wo to those Roman Clergy, they will have cause to curse the time that over they were born to be the cause of so much Blood∣shed. Neither will Spain be free from great Calamity, for he must strike his Sail to that mighty Monarch the Othoman Emperour. And thou, Oh! Italy, hath a great share of this Cup of Gods Wrath, for great will be the Scarcity that will be in thy fruit∣ful Countrey, and a universal Plague will overspread thy Terri∣tories, and the Turk will destroy with Fire and Sword a great part of thy famous Towns and Cities, and he will come even to the Gates of Rome and Saok it as bad as the Gauls did, and will keep Possession, and destroy it with. Fire, and strew Salt upon it, then will the Pope be forced to fly from Place to Place, and soon after will there be no more such Cattle in the World. About which time the Turk will possess Venice, and will to the grief of all Christendom lay that most famous. City waste, and carry the poor, Italians into Cap∣tivity. Neither shall the Muscovite be free, for the Tartar will gain from him a great part of his Countrey on one side, and the Turk on the other, insomuch that it will bring great: Calamity upon his Countrey, many of his Towns
shall be destroyed by Fire, and his People will be carried into Captivity. That most famous Kingdom of Poland will be a great Sufferer, insomuch that the very Key of Christendom will be lost, and his most fruitful Territories will be made a Province of the now Emperour of the Turks. CHAP. V. Of the Opinion of MAHOMET, and under what Constellation it had its Rise, and under what Constellation it will please God it shall have its Desolution. THE Opinion of Mahomet may be said to have its Rise at the time that Mahomet had his Flight at Mecca, being drove from thence by the Sa∣racens; and from thence the Saracens began their Computation of Years, which was in the year 591; and in the year 590 in July there was a Con∣junction of Saturn and Jupiter in Gemini, and about twen∣ty nine Degrees thereof, and upon the sixth day of July, 590 at two Hours fifty three Minutes Post Meridiem, and the Figure for the Latitude of Mecca, which is twenty three Degrees, and is also to the Eastward of London three Hours twenty three Minutes: the Figures for both London and Mecca are as follow.
MECCA ♀ in ♌ 1 53   ☿ in ♌ 14 16   10 House in ♎ 29 14 4. House in ♒ 29 4     11 House in ♎ 1 13 5 House in ♈ 29 10     12 House ♎ 29 10 6. House ♈ 1 13 ♂ in ♏ 6 29   Ascendant ♏ 25 10 7 House ♉ 25 10     2 House ♐ 22 48 8 House ♊ 22 48   ♃ in ♊ 28 0   ♄ in ♊ 29 13   ☉ ☽ in ♋ 16 13 3 House ♑ 24 33 9 House ♋ 24 33 LONDON 10 House ♊ 10 4 House ♐ 10 ♃ in ♊ 28 23   ♄ in ♊ 29 13   ☉ ☽ 16 34   11 House ♋ 21 5 House ♑ 21 ♀ in ♌ 1 53   ☿ 14 26.   12 House ♌ 22 6 House ♒ 22     Ascendant ♍ 15 7 House ♓ 15     2 House ♎ 6 8 House ♈ 6     3 House ♏ 2 9 House ♉ 2 ♂ in ♉ 6 29   Here it is plain to be perceived that Mahomet had his Rise under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Ge∣mini; what the reason all former Au∣thors imagin∣ed that he had his Rise under a Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Scor∣pio I know not, there having been no such for above 630 years before. Now here sinding the Moon to be Lady of the ninth House, and placed not far from the Cusp thereof, and she dispo∣ing of the Sun Lord of the tenth House; from it may be judged that the Law of Mahomet is Lunar, and by
reason of Mars being in Trine to the Sun and Moon, there being no Planot in Aspect to them but he; for this cause until this present time they retain Warlike and Lunar Manners, and that Law of his injoyns all kind of rude, gross, and popu∣lar Things, Pleasures, Vices, Wickedness, Luxuries and Rapes, Wars, Conflicts and Essusion of Blood; and for that Cancer upon the Cusp of the ninth, and she being Lady thereof, there∣fore we conclude the Law of Mahomet to be Lunar; and by rea∣son of Mars beholding of the Place of the Moon with a Trine out of Scorpio his own Sign; it is in part also Martial (there∣fore according to Albumazer, Lib. 1. differ three, and four Mag. Con.) the Moon shall signifie a rude People, which are secluded from all Skilfulness by the Judgment of all Astrologers; therefore that Law is Rude, Gross and Popular, and an Enemy to Learning, even as the common People are, for by reason of the Dominion of Mars in the Watry Triplicity, and his being in the same Triplicity in his own House, in Trine to the Ninth, it injoyneth it self to be protected, not by Ar∣guments, but by Arms: hence it is, that whosoever shall but in the least degree scandalize their Law, shall be slain with Iron; and because the Moon is exceeding swift in comparison of the other Planets, therefore shall it vehemently undervalue all other Laws; nor will it be said to be Presidented by another. Again (to speak Astrologically) seeing that the Faith of Ma∣homer remaineth Martial and Lunar, if we take the great year of both Mars and the Moon, and the half Summe of both their years, and add to the time of the Rise of Mahomet, it will bring us to the time that Faith shall begin to be Abrogated. Now if we add only the great years of Mars and the Moon to the Rise of Mahomet, that will bring us to the time of their greatest height; as for Example: the great years of Mars are 480 years, and the great year of Luna is 260 years: these two be∣ing added, make 740 years, which 740 years being added unto Anno Domini 591, the time that Mahomet had his Flight from Mecca, that will bring us to 1331, at which time the Othoman Family began to gain ground, and the Faith was at the height; then if we add the middle of both their two great years, Viz. 270 years to the former year 1331, that
brings us to 1701; about which time will begin their Con∣version to the Faith of Christ; but because the hidden Se∣crets of God are impenitrable, therefore we intend only to conjecture somewhat about Signs according to the Effects of the Stars, and like one that is Purblind, seeing afar off, di∣scerns only a certain confused Shadow resembling many things, without knowing certainly what it is, by 2 Apot. Com 5. In this case it will be needful to consider the two great Stars that appeared fixed so long a time; the first was that which appeared in the year 1572 in Cassiopia about the twentieth of October in 16 Degrees 54 Minutes of Taurus, having 53 Degrees 45 Minutes of North Latitude, it exceeded Jupiter and Venus in bigness, and it appeared suddenly, and from the very begin∣ing of an equal magnitude, contrary to the first Appearance of all Comets, it also fell in exact Opposition to the Place of Mars in the New-Moon preceding that great Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagittarius, Anno 14. From hence may be expected great War and Bloodshed to the Christians, with a Decay of Christianity in all Places, that is, they shall differ in some certain Principles, for which they shall destroy one another, which great Destruction will continue in one Place. and another near thirty 3 years, because that at the end of thir∣ty two years, God to the amazing of the whole World sent another great Star in the year 1604, in 18 Degrees of Sagitta∣rius, having two Degrees of North Latitude; for the Judgment of which I refer you to my Catastrophe Mundi, wherein I have discoursed at large; this Star appeared near in Opposition to the Place of the Conjunction that preceded the coming of Ma∣homet; not only so, but Saturn and Jupiter and Mars are also in Opposition to that Conjunction. This Star doth without all doubt fore shew the changing of that Opinion to Christianity, because the New-Star is not far enlongated from that Con∣junction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagittarius, in the year of our Lord God 14, and by reason I shall have occasion to mention this Conjunction often, take the Figure of the New-Moon pre∣ceding it, which was on the 9th. day of January, Anno Domini 14, near Noon.
10 House ♑ 16 14 4 House in ♋ 16 14 ☉ ☽ 17 22 ♑   ♉ 5 33   ♀ 5 37   11 House in ♒ 9 20 5 House in ♌ 9 20     12 House in ♓ 12 30 6 House in ♍ 12 30     Ascend. ♈ 25 40 7 House ♎ 25 40   ♂ in ♏ 16 57 ♉   2 House ♊ 1 9 8 House ♐ 1 9   ♃ in ♐ 7 22   ♄ in ♐ 8 28 3 House ♊ 25 57 9 House ♐ 25 37 This Figure was set for the Lati∣tude of Jerusa∣lem, which lyeth to the Eastward of London 3 hours 3 minutes the La∣titude is 32 De∣grees 10 minutes. Here Jupiter is Lord of the ninth House in Sagitta∣rius strong, dispo∣sing of Saturn in the Conjunction, and Saturn doth dispose of Sol, Lu∣na, Mercury and Venus; therefore Jupiter doth signifie Christianity, which Faith will last till the end of Time, but not without its Ebbing and Flowing. It was concluded by Tycho and those Astronomers in his Days, that those two new Stars were such as never appeared since the Beginning of the World, and that they continued each of them in the same place in the Heaven they appeared in, above a whole year, and were at length successively dis∣persed, and therefore are to be accounted Miracles in the Expectation of all Men, but more in their Under∣standing. If we consider the distance of time betwixt the Appear∣ance of the one and the other of these new Stars, we shall find to be thirty three years, measuring out the years of our Saviour. From thence may we conjecture the De∣struction of Monarchies by the Appearance of the first Star, and likewise the Destruction of Antichrist, and all the Babel Opinions of Christianity. So likewise may be conjectured the Kingdom of Peace by the coming of the second Star in the year 1604, in which all the Nations of the World shall know the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of the World.
And forasmuch as it hath been conjectured that the Downfall of Antichrist should be in the year 1666 after the Worlds Redemption, and they have all along reckoned their time from the Birth of our Saviour: but therein have they been deceived; for it cannot be reck∣oned that the World was Redeemed before Christ offer∣ed himself a Living Sacrifice for all Mankind, which makes thirty three years difference: now if we add thir∣ty three years to 1666, that will bring us to the year 1699 in which year will be laid the Foundation of that Kingdom of Peace, and in which all the World shall be bles∣sed. And the Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagit∣tarius 1722 will destroy all the Opinions of the Pagans all over the whole World, and reduce all to the Faith of our Saviour Jesus Christ, but not as it is now Esta∣blished, for all Contrariety of Opinions will be laid open to the Shame of all those professing of the Name of Christ, and that Law shall come to be observed without Com∣pulsion, Love thy Neighbour as thy self. No more cheat∣ing of the World with Shadows, but God will send down his Spirit upon all his Ministers in such a manner, that all Nations shall submit to Mount Zion, and Mankind throughout all the World shall love God with all their Hearts, and Justice will flow like Rivers of Water through all Nations. Oh! Lord, if it be thy Will hasten this time for thy Son's Sake.
CHAP. VI. Being a Suplement to the Judgments of Comets, Where in the two late Comets (Viz.) that which appeared in the year 1680, and that which appeared in 1682, are Astrologically handled. BEfore we come to write our particular Judgment of these two Comets, it will be needful that we consider a time when to set a Figure of that, from thence a Judg∣ment may be drawn according to Art. Now that time I take to be the time, as soon as the Day-light Would permit, and that was at an hour after Sun set, the 17th. day of December 1680. The Figure is as followeth. 10 House ♓ 11 4 House ♍ 18 ☽ in ♓ 23 30 ♂ in ♍ 20 26 11 House ♈ 27 52 5 House ♎ 27 52 ♃ in ♊ 8 13   12 House ♊ 17 33 6 House ♐ 17 33   ☉ in ♑ 6 56 Ascendant ♋ 18 21 7 House ♑ 18 21 ♃ in ♋ 20 31 ♀ in ♑ 21 4   in ♑ 21 30   ♀ in ♒ 4 3 2 House ♌ 7 48 8 House ♒ 7 48     3 House ♌ 25 9 9 House ♒ 25 9 In this Figure you will find Saturn to be Lord of the 9th. and Jupiter Lord of the 10th. both of them in a very dejected condi∣tion: Saturn doth repre∣sent all Matters of Reli∣gion; and by reason of Mercury being Lord of the 12th. and 4th. is ex∣act Opposition to Saturn also, he being in Con∣junction of the Comet. This according to Art should shew great trouble and Vexation to all those
that retain Principles contrary to those Established by Authori∣ty; they will have great Losses as to their Moveables: for which many of them will fly from one place to another, in hopes to better themselves: and forasmuch as Mars being Lord of the 11th. House, and being placed in the fourth in Op∣position to the Moon Lady of the Ascendant. Now the Ascen∣dant according to all Astrologers, doth represent the common People; the 10th. House, all Magistrates; the 2d. the Mo∣veables of the Common People; the 11th. the Assistance of the Magistrates; the 9th. all Matter relating to both Law and Re∣ligion of the Common People. From these Considerations may be drawn a Judgment Astrological; first you will find both the Comet and Mercury in Opposition to the Ascendant, and Sa∣turn Lord of the 9th. Saturn disposing of both Sol, Mercury, Ve∣nus and the Comet; both Saturn and Jupiter and very weak. What these may signifie according to Art, I leave the Artist to consider: it will also be necessary for the young Artist to set a Figure for the time that the Comet is first seen after it en∣ters a Sign. By which means there may be a discovery made what the signification of a Comet should be, and what Nation of the World should be most passive as to its Effects: when this Co∣met first entred Aquarius you will find Cancer Ascendant, and Saturn in the Ascendant, and Mercury in Opposition to him: Mars in Opposition to the tenth, the Dragons-head in the 10th. also; Venus in Opposition to the 2d. House, and Jupiter Lord of the 10th. in Gemini Retrograde: when the Comet entred Piscis you will find Cancer also ascend, and Saturn in the 12th. the Moon in Opposition to Venus near the Cusp of the 8th. the Op∣position of Mars Lord of the 10th. and to the Square of Jupi∣ter Lord of the 9th. These are notable Configurations, and will have as notable Events to follow them, were it lawful for any Artist to write them, but he that is but meanly versed in Astrology may know the signification of these Configurations. Now the Places that will be most concerned you may find in my Catastrophe Mundi. When the Comet came to appear first in Aries you will find Leo to ascend, and Saturn Lord of both 6th. 7th. and 8th. in the 12th. in Opposition to the Sun Lord of the Ascendant, and Taurus is in Square to the Comet, and
the Comet is near the Cusp of the 10th. and is hasting with all speed to the Square of Saturn; and any one that will be but pleased to set a Figure for the time (which was January 3d. at 45 Minutes after Sun-set) he will find which way tho Co∣mets will bend their Effects most: and if you set a Figure for the time the Comet was first seen in Taurus, you will find the Comet upon the Cusp of the 10th. House, and the Moon Lady of the 12th. in Conjunction of the Comet, and the Sun Lord of the Ascendant is not far from a Square of the Comet also. From these Considerations may the young Artist be able to give a Judgment of this that appeared in the year 1680. Now we will come to consider the Configuration of the Planets at the first Appearance of the Comet in Leo 1682, August the 16th. And if we set a Figure for an hour after Sun set, you will find Aries to Ascend, and Saturn Lord of the 10th. 11th. and 12th. is in the 6th. in the same Sign. Now had this Comet had but small Latitude, it would have been set, but by reason of its great Latitude it was near the Cusp of the 8th. Now at the time of these Comets Appearance in Leo we find Mars to be in the very beginning of Leo also, and the Sun and Moon have lately been in Square one to the other. The 10th. House is Capricorn, and Venus Lady of the 7th. is in Libra strong, and there doth Square the 10th. If any one be but pleased to set the Figure for the time proposed, he may the better consider of it still remembring the Ascendant to represent the Com∣mon People, and the 10th. the Magistracy. Now when the Comet, entred Virgo the Figure is almost the same, only the Moon will be in the same Sign with the Comet; the Comet being visible in the 7th. House, the Figure being set for an hour after Sun set, for the day the Comet entred in each Sign will inform any Artist what the signification of it may be; yet for the benefit of the Reader I shall insert my Judgment of both these Comets in general. It bids the East part of Germany beware, for they by the protence of this Comet are threatned by great Devastation by the means of War, the Turk will invade him, and will lay waste many of his Provinces, a mixt sort of People will over-spread Austria, and all the East, North, West, and South-West Parts of Germany, the House of Austria will be brought very low by the hands of both Turks and Christians.
Poland, thou art like to have a great Calamity fall upon thee both by the Turk and Tartar, it is best for thee to stand upon thy own. Legs, for if thou joyns thy Forces with any Prince against Turk and Tartar, it will be in part thy Ruine: they both will prevail against thee in such sort, that thou wilt wish thou hadst never been born, such Calamity will follow upon it. The Muscovite will do well to look to himself, and secure his Territories, for there is Vengeance coming upon him in a short time, and that both by Turk and Tartar. Swedeland, if I might be thy Counsellor, rest in Peace, for thou wilt be very unfortunate in War: but alas! thou wilt not believe it: but know, that if thou wilt dance, the Piper must be paid, and if thou dost go to War with any of thy Neighbours, as I believe thou wilt soon, thou wilt repent when it will be too late. And thou, Oh! Spain wilt have cause to curse thy Counsellor, for thy Kingdom is like to be brought very low, and for thy Cruelty in the West-Indies, shalt thou be driven from thence in less than 30 years, and thy People shall become very poor. France, prepare thy self to undergo a sad Calamity, for there shall be a great Rebellion in the Bowels thereof, that shall shake the Family that now injoys the Crown thereof, if not a quite Overthrow. Italy, thou art like to have thy share of trouble, for the Turk will over-run thy fruitful Territory, and shall lay Rome waste, and drive the Pope from those Parts, and soon after shall there be no more. All those Lands that are said to be under Cancer will have great Calamity in general, that is, the poor People will have great loss as to their Moveables, from which Evil I pray God bless Scotland. I could tell likewise what is like to befall those Places under Aries, but the Times will not bear to hear it; therefore I de∣sire to be excused, because I have said so much as may satisfie any Artist in this Point. Therefore my Friends at this time FAREWEL.
