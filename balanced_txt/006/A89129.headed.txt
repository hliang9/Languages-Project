The Mid-wives just COMPLAINT: AND, Divers other wel-affected Gentlewomen both in City and Country: Shewing to the whole Christian-world, the just cause of their long-sufferings in these Distracted TIMES, for want of Trading, and their great fear of the continuance of it. Which sad Complaint was tendered to the House on Tuesday, Septemb. 22. 1646. With some other Notes worthy speciall Observation. Published according to Order. LONDON, Printed for T. S. 1646.
The Midwives just Complaint, and di∣vers other Gentlewomen both in City and COUNTRY. Humbly shewing, THat whereas many miseries doe attend upon a Ci∣vill-war, there is none greater than the breaking of that conjunction which matrimony hath once con∣firmed, so that womens husbands being absent at the wars, they cannot injoy that necessary comfort and benevolence which they expect from them: this, if well considered, is a shrewd matter, and doth give beginning to a naturall de∣population of Townes and Cities, when the causes of po∣pulous fertillity are any waies hindred, whereby all places, especially this famous City, must needs become very thin of people, and great want of men, fit for employment both for Church and State, and all Corporations must necessa∣rily from thence ensue, for men grow not up on a suddain, there must be a seed time before harvest, bearing of chil∣dren before their birth, as we very well know, who in that kinde have been great assistants unto women, and constant deliverers of much good to the Common wealth. And whereas we are called Midwives by our Profession, we knowing the cases of women better than any other, as being more experienced in what they sensibly suffer since the wars began, living the religious lives of some cloysterd Nuns, contrary to their own naturall affections, if they could by any meanes help it, without wronging their hus∣bands:
Our owne Complaint shall therefore consist of many branches, whereby the injuries of women in this present age may be clearly discerned, for it is a great wrong that women should want their husbands and live without comfort, thereby we Midwives are also undone, for as wo∣men are helpers unto men, so are we unto women in all their extremities, for which we were formerly well paid, and highly respected in our parishes for our great skil and mid∣night industry, but now our Art doth fail us, and little get∣tings have we in this age barren of all naturall joyes, and onely fruitfull in bloudy calamities, we desire therefore that for the better propagation of our owne benefit, and the ge∣nerall good of all women, wives may no longer snare their husbands to be devoured by the sword, but may keep them fast locked within their owne loving armes day and ght, perfecting their embraces in such a manner as is no  be expressed freely, but may be easily conceived by the rong fancy of any understanding woman; We Midwie mst be as secret as night, and close in all conceites, but we know most assuredly that this would bring about much content, while our selves should feast high at Christnings, & nurses also should more frequently be paid for their monthly kee∣ping of women: we have with much horror and astonish∣ment heard of Kenton-Battaile, the Battailes at Newbury, the Battle at Marston-more, the Battle at Naseby, where∣in many worthy members and men of great ability were lost to the number of many thousands, which doth make us humbly to complaine, that blood may not hereafter be shed in such a manner, for many men, hopefull to have begot a race of souldiers, were there killed on a sudden, be∣fore they had performed any thing to the benefit of Midwives, which was a great losse and hinderance to the Common-wealth; whereby some maydes were de∣prived
of promised marriage, and wives by the hand of death were quickly Widdowed, and with them the hope of posterity was also extinguished, it is therefore hereafter to be desired that Warre may not eate up and devoure the youth of this Kingdom, but that men may per∣forme the blessing given to Adam, by encreasing and multiplying, thereby to repayre the great havock and losse which this unnaturall Warre doth make in Eng∣land. Heretofore the happinesse of the English wo∣men was compared unto Heaven, but now they have just cause to tremble at the report of every Gunne, which can send a speedy death to their instruments of conjunction and delight, without whom they are but halfe themselves, and being indeed nothing in themselves, from them they received perfection, weight measure and number, and grow as rich in children as they are in beauty, while we Midwives shall fare and feede the better for their frequent christnings and gossipings. We take notice what Devillish new Engines for Warre are daily invented by the Cyclops and such like Artists, to destroy one another; namely the Poleax, Petronels, Car∣bines, Firelocks, Snap-hances, Pistols, nay cases of Pi∣stols, Granadoes, and their hand Granadoes, and the Mor∣ter peices, and your terrible two-edged swords, able to af∣fright poore women to see such naked weapons; then the Cavalliers, and your Dragoneers and your Ingineers, which are those persons which exercise those weapons: such instruments were never used, or scarce seene in Eng∣land, and all out of jealousies, doubts and feares; be∣cause you men will not confide in one another: All these weapons are but to destroy brave men which should be preserved and kept for better uses and purposes: It were farre better for those men that they followed
their own trade, and the old game of England at home with their wives; then for them to run abroad to be Comman∣ders and common souldiers and stand Sentinel two or three houres in the cold for a little Suffolk cheese and a peice of browne bread, and at length kill one another for eight pence a day, with the night to boot too: and it may be lose a limbe or some other good joynt: when indeed and in very good sooth they need not stand at home so long by nineteen parts and have more thanks (if not a reward) for their paines. It were nothing so irkesome to us poor Midwives that our trade is now decayed, if the sword in the scabbard were used and employed against a Forreigne Enemy; it would not then be halfe so grievous, for the old proverbe saith, what the eye sees not, the heart grieves not at. But we poor Midwives both see, and our hearts know it and now our tongues confesse it; that it is a lamentable case when the son shall goe out against the father; father against the son; bro∣ther against brother, and kinsman against kinsman, this we speake is grievous to be thought on; and we condole even to the lower-most angle of our triangular hearts. We desire therefore that a period may be set to these un∣happy differences, and that the generall and naturall Stan∣dard may no longer lye couchant; but that women may be fruitfull vines, that there may be no armes, but such as will lovingly embrace women, and because we know that some upon different occasions desire to absent themselves from their best beloved, having first plundered their chests and tooke away that they have, we desire that such men may be compelled forthwith to return to their wives, or beare on their heads the fortune which they have most worthily de∣served, being guilty of that punishment by their long ab∣sence. And whereas all are not Penelopes that can withstand the
siege of a strong temptation, but must yeeld up the Fort to the flattering enemie of their long preserved chastity, it is better to keepe then to make that fraile sex honest: let not therefore the drumme wound the ayre no more with false stroakes, nor the pike be bathed in the bloud of guiltlesse men, let not the sword ravish from our bosomes the delight of our lives: this word Husband speaking benefit and com∣fort both to Wives and Midwives, since our felicity can∣not subsist without the others fertillity and fruitfulnesse, and therefore let us Midwives whom it most nearely con∣cernes, desire that some order may be taken; that the old Song of England, may not bee againe revived, slow men of London: And that the delicate sex of women may not lye in their beds like cold Marble images cut out by some Ar∣tificers hand, but being full of warme spirit and life, they may obliege the world to them by repairing the losses of this war, and have husbands as formerly, at their com∣mand, to maintain them bravely, and bring them yearly under the delivering power of the Midwife, which cannot be done unlesse the wars cease, and men return again unto their wives. Moreover wee have just cause to feare those dreadfull Prophesies which point so directly at this age, foretelling Mother Shiptons Prophesie. that there should be a great scarcity of men, and such abun∣dance of women farre exceeding the other, both in strength and number, so that a hundred should run after one, being a fearfull prodigy in nature, and a dearth to be more feared, than that of Corn, or any other commodity: Coales are not so necessary as Husbands warme in bed, and comfor∣table at board, and therefore in this sad age it is fit to take a view of the calamities of women in other Nations, for if men be scarce, all other plenty is nothing to women, they consummate our happinesse, and make us richer than all
the precious stones of the Indyes, therefore most deplorable will the continuall losse of more Souldiers be, since they might live to comfort us, & declare their undaunted valour in the soft and delightfull field of love: And whereas most certaine intelligence hath bin brought unto us, that the Queene when she was in England did heretofore set up her Standard: we desire likewise that our Standard may once again be set up in our City and Suburbs; for we Midwives know that women are not so cold or out of soule, but that they can endure a fight bravely under a Standard, and can use a weapon as well as men if they get it in their handling, let their courage therfore teach them to fight for their own priviledges, and if they prove the weaker vessels, yet wee Midwives desire that the distresses of widowed women be looked upon with a charitable construction, not doubting but by all good willers to their sex, this complaint will be regarded as the publique voyce of their long conceal'd af∣fections, shewing also how greatly necessitated they have bin in their husbands absence, whose happy returne shall satisfie their longing, and give us the Midwives of London great cause to rejoyce. For although we were in good hopes that the wars were now brought to a happy end & therfore did intend to wave this petition or Complaint in the happy enjoying of our Husbands, yet our feare is that the Wars in Ireland beginning now again, and there being some clouds which threaten from the North, that we in these winter nights may still want the company of our husbands and have as cold & empty bodyes and (if timely Redresse be not had) as just an occasion of complaint, as ever heretofore. FINIS.
