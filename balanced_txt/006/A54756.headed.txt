THE PREFACE. FOr the perfect acquiring of any Language whatsoever there are two things mainly required, First to be ac∣quainted in some Measure with the Words of the said Language, Next to understand how to put them together in such sort, as thereby to produce Harmonious Sense and Con∣cord: The right way of putting Words together Effectually, is by the Variation of them; Nouns into their several Cases, Verbs into their several Moods and Tenses; For as in Building▪two pieces of Timber cannot be well fastned together till the Artists Tool hath fitted and shap'd them to that pur∣pose, by Dovetail, Tenon and Mortice, or the like, so no true Syntax can be brought about, till by the said Variation Words are disposed together, in such a form as may render them Capable of such a Conjunction: Whereas, were they Clap'd together unform'd, and Undeclin'd, what could be expect∣ed but a Babel of Confusion and Discord? The Ancients, at least the Greeks and Latins were wonderfully Elaborate and Care∣ful in the diversifying, or Variously terminating the Cases of their Nouns: From whith curious diversity of Terminations, there results an Elegance of Construction, above what even the best of the Modern Europaen Tongues, (wich I take to be the Italian) is capable of Expressing. And besides this Curi∣osity of Declination amongst the Greeks and Romans, the manner of their Derivation and Composition is also very Observable, and worthy to have been more Largely
Treated of, among other parts of Grammatical Subject, than I have yet found it to be, in any System of Grammar: Whereupon having already Publish'd a Materia Verborum, I have Adjoyned this small Treatise by way of Essay, which as occasion serves, may be Improv'd and Inlarg'd. The knowledge then of Words whether Primitive, Derivative, or Composi∣tive, is to be doubly considered, First as to their Signification, Next their Formation; and the first of these Knowledges, in my Opinion, is properly and Naturally the first part of a Learners Office, contrary to the Common Method, since the Knowledge of the Name of any thing is ever antecedent to the knowledge of its Nature. He that hath Treasured up in his Memory a competent stock of Words, will be the more easily induc'd to take pains to inform himself of what ever may conduce to the Application of them, as any one will soon∣er ingage himself in the Concernments of a familiar and known Person, than of a Stranger. Dictionaries we have many, very Elaborate and Copious; more Copious indeed than what is absolutely required for a Learner; it being most apparently evident that one third part of the Words, even of the most Unaugmented Dictionaries, will abundantly suffice for the Reading of any Classical and Authentick Author; be∣sides that, not any one can be capable of making use of a Dictio∣nary, that is not Tollerably vers'd in the Formation of Words. So that a well ordered Materia Verborum to be got without Book, whether according to the usual Method of the Nomen∣clatura's, or otherwise, ought in my Opinion to be the first Praeparatory Work to be began with, as a Foundation for the Building up of a Latinist, or any other Master of Language: But for the gaining of a good stock of Latin Words, there cannot certainly be any better Course taken, than a full and perfect Acquisition of all the Radical and Underiv'd, at least such as are purely and Naturally Latin: For tho perhaps they amount not one with another, to the tenth part of those
Genuine Words produc'd by Derivation and Composition which often Occurring in Authors, are therefore Materi and Necessary to be known. Yet certain it is, that whoeve possesseth the Fountains, hath the greater Command and Benef of the Streams that flow from thence. So that he that i Master of the Primitives, hath at one View the Lati Tongue, and will be thereby the more easily induc'd, an the better Capacitated to Consider and Inquire into the man∣ner of how any Word he chances to meet with is Deriv'd fro or Compounded with a Word he already Knows, as he w at a Distance hath the prospect of any Noble Castle; Town or Palace, will have the greater Mind by a Personal Visi to take a more particular View thereof. To speak farther o the Usefulness of this Design, will be a thing altogether nee∣less: One Evidence by plain Proof, goes farther than an hu∣dred Arguments. I will therefore leave the Event of wh I have Asserted to the Tryal the World may, if it please, ma thereof.

OF THE COMPOSITES Of the LATIN TONGUE. THere was doubtless never any Language or Speech in any part of the World, to which there did not more or less, somthing of Composition belong, that is a sort of Coalition or Consociation of two or more Words together: But of all Languages that ever were Writ or Spoke, I verily believe the Greek first, and after that the Latin, have far the most▪ Elegant and Graceful way of Composition. Of the latter my purpose is to say somthing at present, with as much Brevity as may be. Verbs, Nouns, Adverbs, Praepositions, are all Compoundable one among another, but the most common and frequent sort of Composition, is of Verbs with Praepositions. Praepositions that admit of Composition with Verbs. A, (otherwise Ad or Abs) Ad, To. Ante Before. Circum, About. Contra, Against. Cum, With. In Comp. Con. De, From. E (otherwise Ex) out of In.
