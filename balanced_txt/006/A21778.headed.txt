And her Highnes further pleasure & commandement is, that all Sheriffes shal returne their writtes & Processe against all such accomptants and debtors, at the dayes therein appoynted. And if any person or persons,  ought to accompt or pay any summe or summes of money to her Maiestie, in any the said Courtes & places afore∣ do make default therein, That then her Highnes writtes and processe shalbe awarded, & sent forth against euery ch person & persons, & the same to be duly and orderly serued & returned, by the Sheriffes & Officers thereunto ap∣poynted in such like maner and forme as the same should haue bene, if this present Proclamation had not bene made. And if any Sheriffe or other Officer shall make defaulte, or be negligent in seruing, executing or returning any the sayd writtes & processe aforesayd, That then euery such Sheriffe & other Officer, shal incurre such paynes & penalties as by the sayd Courtes, or any of them shalbe taxed & assessed: Willing and commanding all and euery her Maiesties Sheriffes, Officers, ministers and subiects, to whome it doeth or shall appertayne, to obserue & keepe their assemblies and appearances, with all their returnes and certificates in her Highnes sayd Courtes at Westminster, in the sayde Crastino Martini next comming, then there with the fauor of God to be holden & kept, and there to doe their offices and dutyes in euery behalfe, in like maner & forme, as they should or ought to haue done, if this present Proclamation had not bene had or made, As they will answere to the contrary at their perils.
