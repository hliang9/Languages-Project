A TRUE COPY OF A LETTER From an English Gentleman in the Emperour's Army, to an English Officer in Holland, concerning the Total Rout of the Turks, by the United Forces of the Christians, Com∣manded in person, by the Emperour, the King of Poland, and Duke of Lorain. I Cannot express my self in words suitable to the great deli∣verance it hath pleased God to give the Nation, and Empire of the Germans, from the Cruelties and Barba∣rieties it groaned under, by the Savage Violences of Turk∣ish Insidels, in Conjunction with a worse sort of Menthan them∣selves, who outwardly pretend a Belief of the Blessed Jesus when at the same time, their Power, Industry, and Council tends to no less than the Total Extirpation of Christianity, and the setting up its common Enemy Mahumetism; under the same Notion of the old Rebels in England(Viz.) (for the True Protestant Religion.) There being in the Hungarian Na∣tion two Sects of Protestants, Viz. Lutherans, and Calvinists, the latter of which, claiming the said Epithet under the Banner of the Horrid Imposture and great Idol of the East (Mahomet) I could do no less than make this little short Reflection, because it to me seems a Remark of so near a Parrallel with some practices in my own Country, the Respect I bear to it, would not suffer me to be silent in the laid particulars. The King of Poland, with a Royal Army attending him, arrived at our Camp, the Emperour having caused all necessa∣ry Provisions, to be made for his Royal Majesties Reception, before which, several considerable Reinforcements, were ar∣rived, being part of the Auxiliary Troops of the Empire, of which great Numbers are on their March from all the Remo∣test parts of the Empire: immediately after his Majesty of Po∣land was arrived a great Council of War was held in the Em∣perours Tent; which being ended, prayers were publickly of∣fered throughout the Camp, for a Success upon the Endea∣vours of the United Arms, of the Christians against the
Turks and Infidels, which being ended, immediately the whole Army, by Order, was on its March towards the Enemy; who lay in Seige before Vienna according to common Compu∣tation 150000 strong at least: the Army marched in three Batalias, the Body Commanded by the Emperour in person; the right wing by his Majesty of Poland, and the left by his High∣ness of Lorain, in which posture we marched with all im∣maginable Silence towards Vienna: The City having at we fame time notice that we were approaching, and as soon as we came to discern the Enemies Leagure, the City gave us a Signal, which in half an hours time was seconded with a Resolute sally; in which many Thous∣ands of the Turks were slain, with very small loss on the Christians side. The Turks seeming to be in great Conster∣nation upon the sight of the unexpected numbers of the Christian Army, before the said Salley was ended, part of Our Army under his Highness of Loraine were engaged and soon after the Grosse of both Armies, the dispute being for severall hours very sharp and hot; but in the end it so pleased God, that our Arms prevailed against the Infidels we having kill'd above thirty Thousand upon the spot, and taken near half as many Prisoners and all their Ar∣tillery and Baggage which vvere very great and numerous and Totally broke the vvhole Army of the Turks, vvhich our Horse continue to pursue vvith great slaughter, and all this was done by the Assistance of the Almighty with inconsiderable loss on the Christians side, and it is the opinion of most of our Experienced Commanders here in Camp, that very few of the Turks will Escape of being taken or killed. The Enemy being fled divers of our Offi∣cers went into the City and great numbers of the Citi∣zens came to veiw our Camp, their countenances bespeak∣ing they had been neither in fear of the Enemy nor any want of necessary Provisions. We are now busied in de∣stroying the Enemys works about the City; and in my next I may give you a more particular Account of the whole Affair: in the mean time be pleased to accept of this, as from your much Obliged and Faithfull Friend. and Servant A Whitebrook, Imperial Camp near Vienna, Aug. the 31th.
