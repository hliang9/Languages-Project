With a Paper Concerning their full consent to the PROPOSITIONS To be presently sent to His Majesty for a safe and well grounded PEACE. Die Veneris 26. Junii 1646. ORdered by the Lords in Parliament assembled, That the Marquesse of Argiles Speech, with the Paper concerning the Propositions, be forthwith printed and published. Jo. Brown Cler. Parliamentorum. LONDON: Printed for Iohn Wright at the Kings Head in the Old Bayley. 27 June 1646.
The Marquesse of ARGYLES Speech to the Grand Committee, concerning Pro∣positions of Peace to be sent to his Majesty. My Lords and Gentlemen: THough I have had the honour to be named by the Kingdom of Scotland, in all the Commissions which had relation to this Kingdom, since the beginning of this War; yet I had never the happinesse to be with your Lordships till now, wherein I reverence Gods providence, that he hath brought me hither at such an opportunity, when I may boldly say, it is in the power of the two Kingdoms, yea, I may say, in your Lordships power to make us both happy, if you make good use of this occasion, by setling Religion, the Peace and Ʋni∣on of these Kingdoms. The work of Reformation in these Kingdoms, is so great a work, as no age nor history can parallel since Christs daies, for no one Nation had ever such a Reformation set forth un∣to them, much lesse three Kingdoms, so that this Generation may truly think themselves happy, if they can be instru∣mentall in it. And as the work is very great, so it cannot be expected, but it must have great and powerfull Enemies;
not only flesh and blood which hate to be reformed, but like∣wise Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the darknesse of this world, and spirituall wickednesses in high places. As the dangers are great, we must look the better to our du∣ties, and the best way to performe these, is to keep us by the Rules which are to be found in our Nationall Covenant, principally the Word of God, and in its owne place, the example of the best Reformed Churches; And in our way we must beware of some Rocks, which are temptations both up∣on the right, and upon the left hand, so that we must hold the middle path. Ʋpon the one part, we would take heed, not to settle lawlesse liberty in Religion, whereby, in stead of Ʋniformity, we should set up a thousand Heresies and Schismes, which is directly contrary and destructive to our Covenant. Ʋpon the other part, we are to looke that we persecute not piety and peaceable men, who cannot through scruple of conscience, come up in all things to the Common Rule; but that they may have such a forbearance as may be according to the Word of God, may consist with the Cove∣nant, and not be destructive to the Rule it selfe, nor to the Peace of the Church and Kingdom, wherein I will insist no further, either to wrong your Lordships patience or judge∣ments, who I doubt not will be very carefull to do every thing according to our Covenant. As to the other Point, concerning the Peace and Ʋnion of the Kingdoms, I know it is that which all professe they de∣sire, I hope it is that all do ayme at; sure I am, it is that which all men ought to study and endeavour. And I thinke it not amisse to remember your Lordships of some former experiences, as an argument to move us to be wise for the future. If the Kingdome of England in the 1640 yeare of God, then sitting in Parliament, had concurred, as they were
desired, against the Kingdome of Scotland, no question we had been brought to many difficulties, which, blessed be God, was by the wisdome of the Honourable Houses prevented. So likewise when this Kingdome was in difficulties, if the Kingdome of Scotland had not willingly, yea cheerfully, sacrificed their peace to concurre with this Kingdome, your Lordships all know what might have been the danger. Therefore let us hold fast that Ʋnion which is so happily established betwixt us, and let nothing make us again two, who are so many waies one, all of one Language, in one Island, all under one King, one in Religion, yea one in Co∣venant; so that in effect we differ in nothing but in the Name (as Brethren do) which I wish were also removed, that we might be altogether one, if the two Kingdoms shall think fit; for I dare say, not the greatest Kingdom in the Earth can prejudice both so much as one of them may do the other. I will forbeare at this time to speak of the many jea∣lousies I heare are suggested, for as I do not love them, so I delight not to mention them, onely one I cannot for∣beare to speak of, as if the Kingdome of Scotland were too much affected with the Kings interest. I will not deny but the Kingdome of Scotland, by reason of the Raigne of many Kings his Progenitors over them, hath a naturall af∣fection to his Majesty, whereby they wish he may be rather reformed then ruined; yet experience may tell, their per∣sonall regard to him has never made them forget that com∣mon Rule, The safety of the People is the Supreme Law. So likewise their love to Monarchy makes them very desirous that it may be rather regulated then destroyed, which I hope I need not to mention further to your Lordships, who I trust are of the same minde. I know likewise there are many jealousies and unjust
aspersions cast upon our Armies in England and Ireland, I can, if it were needfull, presently produce heads of a Declaration intended by the Army in England, for vindi∣cating themselves from such injuries, and shewing the clear∣nesse of their resolutions and integrity, both in the Cause, and towards this Kingdome, wherein their undertakings and coming in at such a season of the yeare, their hard suf∣ferings, and constant endeavours since, may be sufficient testimonies. Therefore I am the more bold to desire your Lordships, that so long as they stay in England (which I wish may be for a short time) they may be supplyed with some moneys, and their Quarters enlarged, least their lying in too narrow Quarters, make the burthen insupportable to that exhausted corner of the Country where they now remain and so beget outcries against them, when they are not able to discharge their Quarters, as other Armies within the Kingdome. As for the Army in Ireland, I have beene an eye-wit∣nesse to their sufferings, and so may speake of it likewise up∣on certaine knowledge, That never men have suffered grea∣ter hardships, who might have been provided, for they have lived many times upon a few Beanes measured out to them by number, and never had any other drinke but Wa∣ter. And when they were in some better condition, they had but an Irish peck of rough Oats for a whole week. And now at their best condition, when they are quartered upon the Coun∣try (which is able to entertaine them only for a very short time) they have only an Irish peck of Oatmeal, or a shilling in the ten dayes, both for Meat and Drinke. Therefore ac∣cording to the many desires given in to the Honourable Houses for that end, I humbly entreat that your Lordships will take care to provide for them, so long as it is thought fit they remaine in that Kingdome.
For a renewed testimony of our earnest desires to com∣ply with the Honourable Houses for setling the Peace of these Kingdoms so much longed for, we doe returne unto your Lorships the Propositions of Peace (which we recei∣ved on Tuesday last) with our consent thereunto, wishing they may be hasted to his Majestie, who hath so often called for them. And I likewise offer to your Lordships the Copy of his Majesties Letter to my Lord of Ormond, discharging him from any further medling in any Treaty with the Re∣bels in Ireland, I hope in order to his Majesties further condescending to the setling of that Proposition concerning Ireland, and the rest of the Propositions now to be sent unto him. Another Paper there is which concernes the sup∣plying of the Scottish Armies in England and Ireland, and the perfecting of the Accompts betweene the King∣doms, together with a Letter from Generall Monro to the Committee of Estates of the Kingdome of Scotland, con∣cerning the state of affaires in Ireland. All which when your Lordships have considered, I trust you will take such course therein as ma satisfie our just desires, may put an end to our present troubles, and settle these Kingdomes in a happy Peace. A Paper delivered in from the Commissioners of Scotland, concerning the Propositions. IT is a twelve moneth since we did ear∣nestly presse the sending of Propositi∣ons to the King for a safe and well-grounded peace; In answer whereun∣to the Honourable Houses were plea∣sed to acquaint us, That they had re∣solved Propositions should be sent to his Majesty, but did intend to make some alterations in
the former Propositions, and after eight or nine months deliberation, we received from the Honourable Houses some of those Propositions; and though we did finde therein very materiall additions, alterations, and omis∣sions, which for their great importance, and the interest of the Kingdome of Scotland therein, might very well have required the delay of an Answer untill the Estates of that Kingdome had been consulted; yet so unwilling were we to retard the meanes of peace, that in a fort∣nights time we returned an Answer upon the whole Propositions; and the Houses of Parliament not rest∣ing satisfied therewith, in lesse then ten daies we prepa∣red a further Answer; wherein we did very much com∣ply with the desires of the Honourable Houses, especial∣ly in the matter of setling the Militia of England, and Ireland, and in other things did shew our readinesse to heare, or propose such expedients as might determine any differences, so that in a whole yeares time the Pro∣positions have not remained in our hands the space of foure weekes, which we onely mention to cleare our proceedings from mistakes and aspersions; and the Hou∣ses having now after two moneths farther deliberation, delivered unto us upon the 23. of this instant June, all the Propositions they intend to send to the King at this time; We doe, without any delay, returne such an An∣swer and resolution thereupon, as will be unto the pre∣sent and future Generations, one undeniable testimony (besides many others) of the integrity and faithfulnesse of the Kingdome of Scotland in their solemne League and Covenant, of their love to Peace, and earnest de∣sire to satisfie their Brethren of England in those things which concerne the good and Government of this King∣dome; being further resolved touching the Kingdome
of Scotland, That as nothing of single or sole concern∣ment to that Nation did engage them in this Warre, so nothing of that nature shall continue the same. Al∣though these Propositions now to be sent doe much dif∣fer from the Propositions formerly agreed upon by the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, and the most materiall additions, omissions, and alterations are in such parti∣culars as concerne the joynt interest, and mutuall con∣fidence and conjunction of both Kingdoms, which were, as we conceive, much better provided for, and strength∣ned by the former Propositions then by these. Al∣though the particular Propositions presented by Us, concerning the Kingdome of Scotland are not yet agreed unto by the Houses of Parliament, as was offered in their Papers of the tenth of Aprill. Although divers Propositions of joynt concernment be now superseded, and the sending of them delayed to a more convenient time, as is expressed in the Votes of both Houses of the twenty sixth of March; and although (which is to Us more then all the rest) those Ordinances of Parliament unto which the fifth and sixth Propositions doe relate, (and were therefore communicated unto Us upon our desire to see what the Houses had already agreed upon concerning Religion) doe not containe the establish∣ment of such a Reformation of Religion, and unifor∣mity as was expected, and was the chiefe end of our engagement in this Warre; and as all these Ordinances put together come short of what we wished, so there are some particulars which we conceive to be incon∣sistent with the Word of God, and the example of the best reformed Churches, and therefore cannot in our consciences consent unto them; which particulars were
expressed to both Houses in the Remonstrance of the Commissioners of the Church of Scotland of the date, March 26. 1646. Yet neverthelesse we do so earnestly desire and so high∣ly value the easing of the heavy Pressures under which both Kingdomes groane, and the bringing of this bloudy lasting warre to a speedy and happy end, considering with-all that not onely the Booke of Common Prayer and the Prelaticall Government are abolished, & a Com∣mon directory of worship established in both Kingdoms, but that likewise the Ordinances afore mentioned do containe divers Parts of a Positive Reformation and uniformity in Church-Government, unto which we formerly gave our consent in our answer upon the whole propositions of Peace, of the 20. of April, and for so happy begining, and so good a foundation laid for the future, we heartily thank God, and do acknowledge the zeale, Piety and Wisedome of the Honourable Houses therin, remembring also that those Ordinances doe not con∣taine the whole moddell of Church government and that the Houses have beene Pleased to expresse [that it cannot be expected that a perfect Rule in every Particular should be setled all at once, but that there will be neede of suppliments, & aditions, and happily of alterations, in some things, as experience shall bring to light the necessity thereof] upon these Considerations as we doe cheere∣fully consent to many materiall Parts of these Propo∣sitions so we Resolve to make no let, but to give way to the sending of such other particulars therein con∣tained, with which we are unsatisfied in the matters for the Reasons formerly Represented to both Houses, of which some still stand in force, though others of them be taken away by the new expedients it being alwayes
understood that our not Dissenting from, nor our op∣posing of the sending of the Propositions as they now stand, shall be no prejudice nor Impediment to all or any one of the Articles of the Solemne League and Cove∣nant, especially to the first Article, concerning the pre∣servation of the Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Govern∣ment, against our Common enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdomes of England and Ireland in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, ac∣cording to the Word of God, and example of the Best Reformed Churches, and the bringing of the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes, to the neerest conjun∣ction and uniformity in Religion, Confession of faith, forme of Church-government, Directary, for Worship, and Catechising; Which thing both Kingdomes are by Covenant oblieged sincerely and Really to Endeavour, and that not for a time, but constantly, so that neither of the Kingdomes can be loosed or acquitted from the most strait and solemne obligation of their continued and constant endeavouring these good ends so farre as any of them is not yet attained, it being also understood that our concurrence to the sending of the Propositi∣ons shall be without prejudice to any Agreement or Treaty betweene the Kingdomes, and shall not infringe any Engagement made to the Kingdome of Scotland, nor be any hindrance to our insisting upon the other Propositions already made knowne to the Houses; and it being understood that it is not our Judgment that eve∣ry Particular and Circumstance of these Propositions is of so great Importance to those Kingdomes as Peace and warre should depend thereupon. Upon these grounds which we make known only for
clearing our consciences, and for discharging Our selves in the trust put upon us, without the least thought of Retarding the so much longed for Peace, We Condi∣send and agree that the Propositions as they are now Resolved upon be in the Name of Both Kingdomes presented to the King, whose heart we beseech the Lord wholly to incline to the Councels of Truth and Peace. Iune 25. 1646. FINIS.
