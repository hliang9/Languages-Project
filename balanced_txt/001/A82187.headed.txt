wounded in that they call the place of their worship, where the Children of God hath been almost murdered; but these are the Fruits and Marks of Cains-Generation, and Balaams, who are of old ordained for Condemnation, which condemnation is the Light, which to it in all your Consciences I do speak, which is your con∣demnation, who, to it, contrary do walk; and you that hold up such as receives gifts and rewards, you hold Balaam, and follow Balaam, and so turn from the true Prophets of the Lord, which ever testified against such; and you that do maintain such, maintaine Balaam, and are blind, witnessed against with the Scriptures; let that in your Conscience, and the Scriptures judge you, who con∣trary to it do act, and that which gave forth the Scriptures, who holds up Balaam, and such as goes in his way; you love not God that doth see; but love the world, and are of the world, and the world loves their own, such as goes in Balaams way, receives gifts & rewards, the wages of unrighteousness, and in Cains way, perse∣cutes; the world loves, yea, and fights for with stones, staves, and their Books; and they have a Popish Law to guard them, which guarded the Papists; and such as go in Cains way, and Balaams way, are not Gods, but the worlds, and the world loves them, as you may read, in Peter and Jude, Let the Apostles words there judg you, and you that holds up such as bears rule by their means, ye are not of God, and ye hold up such as are not of God, but of the world, and the world loves her own; and the Prophet Ieremy testi∣fied against such, who was of God, as you may read, Ier. 5. and such Shepheards as seek for their gain from their Quarter, are the worlds, and the world loves her own▪ for such are not of God, for the Lord sent his Prophet to cry against such; as you may read, Isa. 56. and such are the worlds, and not Gods, as seek for the fleece; such Shepheards as makes a prey upon the people, and devours them, such are the worlds, and the world loves her own and the Lord sent his Prophet Ezekiel to cry out against such; as you may read, Ezek. 34. And such are not of God, but of the world, and such the world fights for, with Clubs, States, and Stones: And such
as are Hirelings, which the Lord sent Ieremiah and Micah-to cry against, these are the Worlds Priests, and Prophets, & not the Lords, and these are their Fruits and Mark, and the world hears their own, and loves such, and fights for such, and persecutes the dear Children of the Lord, which are moved to cry out against them, and such Magistrates as be ignorant of the true and wise God, per∣secutes them, to the fulfilling of the Scriptures, and such as are cal∣led of men Master, stands praying in the Synagogues, the chiefest Seats in the Assemblies, which Christ cryed wo against, are the worlds, not Christs, and the world loves her own, and fights for such as are called of men Master, stands praying in the Synagogues, and have the chiefest Seats in the Assemblies, the world hears such, and not Christ; they that are of Christ hears not such, but Christ Iesus the Son of God; and all such as are called of men master, goes in Cains way, and Balaams way, are the worlds, which receives the wages of unrighteousness Gifts and rewards, and are persecutors, and the worlds, and held up by the world, and the world loves such and fights for such, and such their persons must be respected, and such regards not the Law of God, but casts it behind their backs, and such as these are their fruits and marks, and they that do re∣spect persons, are convinced by the Law of God to be transgressors, & he that breaks one point breaks, all & they that cannot respect persons, but the Law of God, with the world persecuted and im∣prisoned, witness the Goales now in the Nation of England: To the Light in all your Consciences I speak which comes from Iesus, which lets you see the world, and lets you see all that which they that dwelt in the Light were sent to testifie against, and lets you see the Law of God, which is one with that of God in every mans Conscience, which if you love this Light, it wil let you see Christ Jesus from whence it comes, and wil let you see all the fruits and marks of the worlds teachers, which if you hate the Light, and act those things contrary to the Light, as they who in the Scrip∣tures declared against the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles; with the Light you are all seen, and your actions contrary to the Light,
with the Light you are condemned, for this is the condemnation the Light saith Christ: and to you this is the word of God, and re∣member you are all warned in your life time; all such teachers as bear rule by their means, are the worlds, which the Lord sent Ieremiah to cry against such, and the world fights for such, and say they are Ministers of Christ, and such as are called Ministers, pri∣sons and persecutes, to hold up their kingdome, that their folly may be made manifest, and their fruits and marks may be seen, and all such shepheards that seeks for their gain from their quar∣ter, that the Lord sent I say to cry against, and all such shepheards as seek for the fleece, and make a prey upon the people, which the Lord sent Ezekiel to cry against; are the worlds, and the world loves such, and fights for such shepheards, let their daily practise judge, and all such as are Hirelings, and preach peace to the peo∣ple, but if they put not into their mouthes, they prepare war a∣gainst them; these are of the world, and the world loves such, and fights for such, let their practise judg, all such as are called of men Masters, stands praying in the Synagogues, and have the upper∣most Seats in the Assemblies, are the worlds, for Iesus Christ cry∣ed wo against such, and all such as goes in Cains waie, and Bala∣ams waie, and speaks a divination of their own brain, are the fil∣thie dreamers, and through Covetousness makes merchandise of the people through feigned▪ words; these are all the worlds, and these are their Fruits and Marks, contrary to the Prophets, Apostles and Christ, with the Light was they all testifyed a∣gainst, and it is witnessed and seen now in this Nation, that the World holds up such, and Love and Fights for such contrary to the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, Let their practise and the Scriptures be their Iudge, and that in their Consciences their Condemnation.
Jesus Christ saith, Beware of salse Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Cloathing, but inwardly are raving Wolves; now here are some Marks and Fruits by which they should know the false Prophets they are inwardly raving Wolves, they are as the bryers and the thorns, and corrupt trees, that bring forth the evil Fruit, their house is upon the sand; and it is not every one that saith Lord, Lord, that enters into the Kingdome of God, but he that doth the wil of the Lord: And here the false Prophets gets the Sheeps Cloathing, that which cloathed the Sheep, and so the good words deceives the simple, but they themselves are as thorns and bryars, and inwardly ravening wolves; and these are the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets, though outwardly they appear beautiful, as yon may read, Mat. 7. And secondly, more Marks and Fruits you may see of the false Prophets, they be they which are out of Christs Doctrine, love the chiefest place at Feasts, the chiefest seats in the Assemblies, greetings in the Markets, and to be called of men Master, which Christ saith, Be ye not called of men Master, ye have one Master, to wit, Christ, and ye are all Brethren: & he that will be greatest among you, let him be your servant: And here a∣gain they be out of Christs Doctrine, and by their Fruits you may know them. Read Mat. 23. throughout, it is worth your reading and observing, for to discover to you the Fruits and Marks of the false Prophets, or Pharisees▪ which Christ cryed wo against: And again you may read Mat. 24. the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets and the Antichrists such as are drawing people to lo here, and lo there, whenas Christ saith, Go not forth, who lighteth eve∣ry man that commeth into the world. Ioh. 1. 9. that with this Light they may come to see him, and all the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets. And again you may see in Mat. 10. such as Christ sent forth, they was not to take Gold nor Silver, nor Money, nor two Coats, nor a staffe, he told them they should be scour∣ged in the Synagogues; and here you may see such scourge in their Synagogues, which takes the Gold the Silver, the Money, the staff, and such other things as are mentioned in the same Chapter, contrarie
to Christs command: and here you may see the Marks and fruits of the false Teachers: and again, they are such that sware, which Christ Iesus saith, Sweare not at all, and so there they do not own his Doctrine, but are against it, and are Antichrists, and by their Marks and Fruits they are known. And again they are such as serve not our Lord Iesus Chrict, but their own bellies, and through flattering speeches deceives the simple, Rom. 16. And they are such as sues men at the Law, and here they are out of Christs Do∣ctrine, and by their Fruit we know them, 1 Cor: 6. and such are they as transform themselves as Ministers of righteousness, and as an Angell of Light, but by their Marks and Fruits we know them, and they are such as confess they have not the same Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, and so draws people from the Spirit, and so bewitch them Gal. 3. and are such as have the form of godliness, but the power deny, which are to be turned awaie from, they are headdie, high minded, boasters, and proud, unholie, cursed speakers, truce-breakers, false-accusers, intempe∣rate, fierce, no lovers at all of those that are good, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God: Of this sort are they which creep into Houses, leading sillie women captive, which be al∣waies learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, but doth resist the truth, as Iannes and Iambres, did, being men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, which respect no mans person, which purifi∣eth the; Heart Here by their Marks and Fruits you shal know the false Teachers, the false Prophets, 1 Tim. 3. and they are such as are puffed up, knowing nothing, doting about Questi∣ons, and strife of words, whereof commeth Envy, strife, railings and Evil surmizings, froward disputations, men of corrupt minds destitute of the truth, which think gain is godliness; from such seperate thy self: Here is their Marks and Fruits by which thou maist know them. 1 Tim. 6. And they are such as desire after Money, and lusteth after it, which draws men into perdition, and de∣struction and noysome Lusts, and so are erred from the Faith. And
ther Marks and Fruits, Oh man of God, flee these things and fol∣low after righteousness, and godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness, and lay hold on eternall life; and prophane bablings, ungodliness, put away foolish and unlearned Questions, which genders strife, and their words shall fret as a Canker; and here is their Marks and Fruits, 2 Tim. 2. and are such as are given to tel∣ling of Fables, and Stories, having itching ears, and so are turned from the Doctrine of Christ, 2 Tim. 4. whenas the Lord saith, Thou shalt not walk about with Tales among any people: Levit. 19. and in Titus you may see the Marks and Fruits of the false Teachers, they are Vain-talkers, Deceivers of minds, not holding fast the faithfull word, according to Doctrine, which teacheth for filthy lucre sake, whose mouthes must be stopped, evil beasts and slow-bellies reprove them sharply; here you may see more marks and fruits of the false Prophets. Again you may prove them by the Apostles Rule, he must not be slandered of Riot, not taking heed to Fables, and com∣mands of men that turn away from the Truth, Tit. 1. And again he must be one that is temperate, and modest, and harmless, apt to teach, unreproveable, the Husband of one Wife; and not given to joyne, no striker, not given to filthy Lucre, one that can rule his own house honestly, if he cannot, how can hee take care for the Church of God? He must be grave, not double tongued; and first, let them be proved, and then let them mini∣ster if they be found blameless, and here is the Marks and Fruits of a false Teacher, and how a true Teacher may be known from a false, and you that take any without proofes, are not them that proves all things, and holds fast that which is good, as you may read, 1 Tim. 3. 1 Thess. 5.
Again, the false Prophets are such as makes merchandise of the word, through seigned words and covetousuess, and speaks great swelling words through the lusts of the flesh, promising liberty, are themselves servants of corruptions, for of whom a man is overcome he is in bondage, and here is Marks and Fruits of the false Pro∣phets, and they are such as sport themselves in the day time, with wantonness thorgh the lusts of the flesh, live delitiously, delighting themselves, and feasting with you (in their deceivings,) hearts exercised with covetousness, beguiling the souls that are not established, as natural bruit beasts to be destroyed, perish in their own corruptions, by reason of whom, the way of truth is evil spoken of; and many follow their pernicious wayes: Here is the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets, and such as deny the Lord Jesus that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift dam∣nation; there is the end of the false Prophets, 2 Pet. 2. And they are such as are giving private interpretations of the Scriptures, which came not by the wil of man, neither is it of any private interpretation; and here is another Mark which comes from the private interpretations, which fils the world so ful of opinions; so as Iohn saith, every Spirit is not to be believed, but they are to be tryed; that spirit that confesseth not that Jesus is come in the flesh, is not of God▪ but is Antichrist, of whom ye have heard should come; but now already is come into the world; look to your selves, whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God, he that con∣tinueth in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath both the father and the son; and if there come any among you and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houses, norbid him God speed, lest ye be partakers of his evil deeds, as you may read in the E∣postles of Iohn, and he that hath the form of godliness and not the power, from such turn a∣way: And here you may see more of the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets and Deceivers, and they are such as turn the grace of God into wantonness, denying God the only Lord, and our Lord Jesus Christ, though they have the form of godliness, but denyes the power; and as raging waves of the Sea, murmurers and complainers, walking after their own lusts, whose mouths speak proud things, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage, following the way of Cain, and of Balaams wages who perished in the gainsaying of Core; and mockers, which should come in the last times, which should walk after their ungodly lusts, having not the spirit, but having mens persons in admiration, which is out of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ: And▪ here is more of the marks and fruits of the false Teachers, as you may read in Iude & Iames 2, and are in the wisdome which is below, where is envy and strife, sedition, and all manner of evil works, and here is the fruits of their wisdome; so the wise man which is endued with knowledge, and the wisdome of the Lord Jesus the true Prophet sees and savours the fruits and marks of the false Prophets, and super fluity, and filthi∣ness, and maliciousness; these are the Fruits of them that deceives their own souls, that are speakers of the Scriptures, and doth not live in the life, Iames 1: & Isay de∣clared the fruits of the false Shepheards, and the marks, he said they seeke for their gain from their quarter, and they was greedy Dogs, and many other Marks he gives them; and the Apostle bids Mark them that walk not according to the Doctrine of Christ. And Isajah saith they are greedy and can never have enough; and here is the Marks and Fruits of the false Shepheards, Isa. 56. shews how they may be known: And
Again Ieremiah doth shew the Marks of the False Prophets, how they speak a vision of their own heart, and not from the mouth of the Lord, and how they do not stand in the Lords counsel, but they are such as used their tongues but the Lord sent them not; and such as run; but the Lord hath not spoken to them, and such as by their lyes and their lightness, counsel the people to erre, and such steals the word from their Neighbor. And against such Prophets wil the Lord come, and the Lord tels such his word is as a hammer, and as a fire; and here ye may see the Fruits and the Marks of the false Prophets, which gets the Letter, and tels people it is the word, Ier. 2. And again Ieremiah shews the Marks and Fruits, and the horrible filthy thing, the Prophets prophesie lies, and the Priests bear ule by their means, and the people love to have it so: O foolish people, eyes, and do not see, ears, and do not hear! fear ye not me saith the Lord? Ier. 5. & Ezek. 34. you may read how he sets forth the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets, how they make a prey vpon the People, and devour them; And again Mi. 3. how he doth shew forth the Marks and Fruits of the false Prophets, and he saith they deceive the people, They cry peace to them, but if a man do not put into their mouths, they prepare war aganst him: here is one of their Marks, and he faith, they shall cover their lips, for they have no answer from God; therefore they tell people the Letter is the VVord, where it saith, God is the word. Iohn 1: And again Micah saith, They prophesie for Money, and teach for hire, and against such was Micah sent to cry a∣gainst, and their Fruits, and by their Fruits and Marks they are known. And Mallachy he shews the Futs and Marks of the Priests, VVhose blessings are cursed, whose sed is corrupted, such as neglect Gods command, Mall. 1. The Fruits of the Idol-Shepheards, Zach. 1. and the judgments of God that shall come upon them: and the Fruits of the false Fast of hypocrites, which Zacharias was sent to speak against, Isa. 58. 7. there you may read, and how the Lord sent Habuckuk to cry against the persecutors, Hab. 1. & Hos. 6. he sets forth the fruits of the murtherous Priests, how they (as Thieves) wait for a man, so a company Priests murther in the way by consent, for they work mischief. And ye may read the Marks and Fruits of the false prophets in Ezk. 13. and how they polluted the people for hand-fuls of Barly, and pieces of Bread, to slay the souls of them that should not dye; and these are the foolish prophets that follow their own Spirits, and see nothing, and they say the Lord saith it, but the Lord hath not sent them, and they made others to hope that they should confirm to the words of the prophesie, these were them that daubed with untempred morter, and these are them that hunt souls, and these are like Foxes in the vast places, and these are them that have their pillows, and strengthen the hands of the wicked; and here are the Marks and Fruits of the false prophets, which the Lord is against, which have their pillows under their arm, and wil not let their souls go; and here is he Mark & the Fruit of the false prophets, and you may see the Fruits of the false prophets, which do discover the iniquity, in Lamen. 2. and Ier. 29. there shews the Marks and Fruits of the false prophets, how they prophesied lies in the name of the Lord God, and I have not sent them saith the Lord. This is to all you that speaks in his name, & he hath not sent you, here is a mark and a Fruit, by which ye may be known, and Ier. 14. there he shews the Marks and fruits of
the false Prophets, how they spoke in his Name, and he hath not sent them, neither command them, Neither spake I unto them, but they prophesie unto you a false vision, and deceipt of their own heart, and prophesie in his name, and the Lord hath not sent them; and here is Fruits and Marks how they may be known, which who was in the light discovered. And again you may see the Marks and fruits of the evil Pastures, in the 10. of Ieremi∣ah, and their Marks and Fruits there, how they become as Beasts, and have not sought the Lord; and ye may see the Marks and Fruits of the chief Priests, which were ene∣mies to our Lord Jesus Christ, the unchangeable Priest; the chiefe Priests could tell Herod by the Scriptures, where Christ should be born, when he gathered them toge∣ther, and the chief Priests adjured Christ to tel them whether he was the Son of God, (though the chiefe Priests could tel by the Scriptures where he should be born) yet they knew him not when he was come, for he was not born by the will of man: And then when Jesus confessed he was the Son of God, the High Priests rent his cloathes, and said he had spoken blasphemy; so when the morning was come, all the Chiefe Priests and Elders took Counsel against Jesus to put him to death, and led him away bound; and here was their Fruits, and is the Marks of the Chief Priests now: and Pontius Pilate, before whom he witnessed a good Confession; and the chiefe Priests and Elders, and all the Counsell, sought false witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and the High Priest mocked him, with the Scribes, and Elders, and Pharises; and the chief Priests and Elders had persw aded the people that they should ask Barnabas, and destroy Jesus; and here is their fruits and marks▪ And Iudas which betrayed Christ, had money of the Chief Priests, and came with a great multitude, with Swords and Staves from the High Priests to take Iesus, and so when Iudas tur∣ned from Christ, he turned to the Priests, who was the betrayer to the murtherers, and when it was heard that Iesus was risen, and shewed to the high Priests, they gathe∣red together with the Elders, and took counsell, and gave large Money to the Soul∣diers, saying, say ye his Disciples came by night, and stole him away whilest we slept: and here is the Marks and Fruits of the priests and lyars, as you may read in Matthew, and ye may see the Marks and Fruits of the Chiefe priests who examined Stephen in the 7. of the Acts, Stephen for witnessing forth Christ Iesus the unchangeable Priest, was Stoned to Death, denying the Types: And Saul, whilest he was under the Priests, had a Commission from them to persecute them which witnessed the second Priest-hood: and here was the Marks and Fruits of the first priest-hood, and of Saul while he was under it; and after Paul was persecuted with the Chief Priests, and the Jews, when he was come to witness Christ Jesus the second priest-hood, and denie the Temple and the first priest-hod, Acts 24. & Acts 17. & Acts 21. & Acts 22. 5. and many exam∣ples and Marks, and Fruits, you may read in the Revelation, how Iohn (by the spirit of the Lord) sets them forth there, and in Peter and Iude also.
THe word of the Lord God to all you which are called the two Mothers in this Nation, with them which do come from you, whom you have made Ministers (as you call them,) they have told us Christ Jesus hath sent them, and we see now with the Light which comes from Jesus Christ, that they are made Ministers by the wil of man, and Christ Jesus sent them not, but their Mothers (as they call them) and they told us the Letter it was the Light, when the Letter saith, Christ is the Light; here we do charge them, both they and their Mothers, to be lyars, and to be adulterate from the Light, and knows nothing but the outside, so with the Light they all lyars are to be condemned for the Lake, as its written, the lyars must have their portion in the Lake that burns, and they and their Mothers have filled this Na∣tion ful of their lyes, but with the Light which comes from Jesus Christ which never changes, they are comprehended with it, and condemned to the Lake of Lyars, and they told us the Sons and Children that came from their Mothers; that the Bible it was the Word, and the Bible saith, that in the beginning was the word and the word was God: And here again with the Light which comes from this word, which word endures for ever, which was before paper and ink was, and the Scriptures was given forth; and here again we do charge both the Mothers and their Sons to be lyars, and no Ministers of the word, for they which was Ministers of the word, and eye witnesses, took in hand to set forth a Declaration in order, so it is a Declaration which the Mi∣nisters of the word set forth, which word was in the beginning, by which all things was made and upheld by the word and power, the word became flesh and dwelt a∣mongst us, and here thou that hast sit as Queen, and seen no sorrow, and had many children, thy desolation is comming and come, and the loss of thy children, thy skirts are seen, and thy nakedness appears, and thy lewdness, and whoredomes, and witch∣craft, and lyes doth appear to all the children of the Light, who are in the Light that comprehends all the world, and reaches over it: And the Children which are come from their mothers, taught us and told us that Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, was the O∣riginall, and is the Originall, and such learned men must open the Scriptures: and with the Light which is eternall, which is come from the Son of God, with it we do see that before Babell was, all the earth was of one Language, and then Nimrod the cunning hunter before the Lord, which came out of Ham's Stock, the Father of Ca∣naan who was cursed, he was the beginner of the building of Babell, whom God con∣founded into many Languages, and we do see that Pilate which crucified Christ had this Originall, Hebrew, Greek, and Latine and set it over Christ; so here with the light we see them Babylon building up, and throwing down, with their many Languages which is confusion, and their Mother the Mother of Harlots, which teacheth them many languages, which is trimmed and deceives the Nations, but with the Light which commeth from Jesus Christ, she and her Sons are comprehended, and they can go no further then Babel, which are Babylon, for with the Light you are seen, com∣prehended and judged, with the word which was before any language was, by which all things was made, as is said before, and here you are hammered, who are in many languages, with the word which was as a hammer to beat you in pieces, and with the word you are to be cut and divided assunder, for the word is as a two-edged sword, & the word is as a fire to burn you up, who be in the many Languages; and to you all
is the word of the Lord, which doth endure for ever, and who are redeemed, are re∣deemed forth of the many languages, and is come before Babel was: And the Chil∣dren which come from their Mother, told us that sprinkling Infants was the Baptism, and the Steeplehouse was the Church, of a Sacrament, which there is no such Scrip∣ture; and so here again with the Light which Christ Jesus hath enlightned us with∣all, we see they taught us more lyes, and so with the Light they are to be condemned, as I said unto you before, for the light that gave forth the Scriptures saith, the Church is in God, and with the Spirit they was all baptised into one body, and was made all to drink in one spirit; with the Light we do see and witness this, praised be God, which hath seperated us from this lying Generation, which holds up these Mothers and their Sons, which be Teachers of Lyes. And they did tel us these Children that comes from their Mothers, that they were the ministers of God, and his Prophets, and his messen∣gers; now with the Light which comes from Christ Jesus we do them all see to be such as be out of the truth, and such as the Lord sent Mcah to cry against, that are hire∣lings, they that doth not put into their mouths they prepare war against them, they that doth, to them they preach peace, and boast, and say, is not the Lord amongst them? none evil can come to them; who see the evil and transgression, with the light which comes from Christ comprehended they are, with the Light the Prophet that saw Christ, witnessed against such with the same Light, which Light we witness made manifest, which never changes, with which light all deceits and deceivers are com∣prehended, and with the Light we do see them that come from their mothers, to be such as seeks for their gain from their quarter, as beareth rule by their means, as see∣keth for the fleece, which the Lord sent his Prophets to cry against, which was in the Light, vvhich vvith the Light they savv Christ, vvhich Christ hath enlightned us with, with which Light we see the same as the Prophets did, which was witnesses of Christ with the Light, and so here we do see them to be deceivers that goes into the world, who useth their tongues, and saith the Lord saith, when he never spoke to them, and speaks a divination of their own brain, and follow their own Spirits, which are the dreamers, with the Light they are seen which never changes, and with it which is eternall all comprehended; and to you this is the eternal word of God, and these Sons that come from their Mothers, told us they was Christs Embassador; with the Light which comes from Christ, which Christ hath enlightned us withall, we do see them to be holding up the figures in the first Covenant, and their Mothers to be lyars, and they no Embassadors of Christ, which takes tythes of the people, and if they will not give it them who witnesses the unchangeable Piest, Christ Iesus, and deny the chan∣geable, they sue them at the Law, and cause them to be hailed before magistrates, Courts, & Sessions, & put them in prisons, because they wil not pay them tythes, here you are declared to the whole nation to be lyars, and no Embassadors of Iesus Christ, for whom he sent forth, he sent forth freely and denyed all oppression; here with the Scripture it self you are judged to be out of the practise of them that he sent forth, & you that take tythes of the people, & brings the Scripture for your rule, as they that received tythes in old time, which had a store-house to put it in, & them that did not bring their tythes and il it, they robbed God, as saith Mallachie, and the Priests which received the tythes, the
strangers; the fatherless, & the widdows was to come within the Priests Gate, & he was to minister forth to the stranger, the widdows, & the fatherless, that there might be no beggar in Israel; now to you that receives tythes I speak, who are neither ministers of the Gospel, nor ministers of the first covenant, but jugglers, as you call it, are made manifest to all that be in the light. Now it you say, give Caesar his due, which are Hypocrites, and bring that for your Cloak for to hold up the figure, the first priest-hood, that Cloak wil not you cover, but your nakedness and whoredome from the Light is seen, and with the Light are all to be condemned, from the First Covenant, and the Second both, who are found in the truth in neither, for the first priest-hood who had the Store-house, into which the Tythes was received, which the priests ministred forth to the strangers, widdows, and Fatherless, a Figure of the unchangeable Priest, Christ Iesus; who ministers out of the everlasting Treasure, and while the first priest-hood was standing, Store-houses and Tythes was prea∣ched up, it was before Christ Iesus was preached up, the unchangeable riest, over the houshould of God, then the unchangeable was confessed with them, and the changea∣ble priest-hood, store-house, and Tythes was denyed, disanulled, and of no effect, which the deceivers of the world for their own ends, Mothers and Sons brings up tythes a∣gain, and say they are Ministers of Christ, but with the Light which comes from Christ Iesus, we do see who they are, and what they are, that have told us these lyes, so with the Light they are to be condemned, and their Mothers and their Children, and their polites that they have begotten: To the Light in all your Consciences I speak, which shall witness me eternally, and you all condemn that hate it, and hold up such things; and to you this is the word of God, that you might see your selves what you are: and they have told us which came from their Mothers, that they was in Christ steed, and he sent them; but with the eternal Light which never changes, which Christ Jesus hath enlightned us withall, we do them see in the steps of the Scribes and Pharisees, garnishing the Sepulchers of the Righteous, building the Tombs of the Prophets and Apostles, as whited walls, outside Sepulchers, and Graves which buries the just, whose hands are ful of Blood, Envie, and Hatred, which be such as are called of men Ma∣ster, and have the chiefest places in the Assemblies, standth praying in the Syna∣gogues, in the steps of the phraisees their Fathers, which were enemies to Christ, as you may read, Mat. 23. And with the Light which comes from our Lord Jesus Christ, you are all seen, and with it to be condemned, no cloak can cover you, but you are seen with all the Children of Light, praised be the Lord God. And the word of the Lord God to all you who saith that you are gifted men, who saith that you are not made Ministers by these two Mothers, but you are experienced men, and received a gift, and you must exercise your gift, and you wil have 40. 50. 60. 80. pounds a year, more or less, as you can get it for your gift: You I do charge, in the presence of the living God, to be such as erred from the Spirit, as your Father Balaam did, are turned from the commands of God, as Cain did, and you are in the selfe-seperation, whose fruit shall wither; you are the Clouds without water, the wan∣dring stars, who receive the wages of unrighteousness, who speaks high swelling words, through the lusts of the flesh, which hath mens persons in admiration because of advantage; you are the wells without water, which say you are experienced men,
and gifted men, and go sell your gift to the world; here again I do charge you, in the presence of the living God, to be lyars, dissemblers, and deceivers of the world, and contrary to the Scriptures, and never exercised the gift of God, for the Elect you can∣not deceive which have received the gift of God, which is perfect, which cannot be bought and sold for money, so your gifts which can be sold for money are not recei∣ved from God, but the Light which comes from Christ Jesus which is eternall, you and your gifts are to be condemned, which can be bought and sold for money, you are them that seperate your selves, not having the Spirit, with the Light you are seen and your fruit which withers, and with it which never changeth you and it is con∣demned; to that in your Consciences which never changes I speak, which shall wit∣ness me, which condemns you: to you this is the eternall word of God. And you that say you are Ministers of Christ, and declare against these two Mothers before mentio∣ned, and her Sons and Children, and you your selves are such as are called of men ma∣ster, have the chiefest place in the assemblies, and stand praying in the Synagogues, which our Lord Jesus Christ cryed wo against, and now say the Scriptures is your rule, here with Christs words are you judged, and seen to be deceivers that deceives the world; but they who are in Christ, which cryed wo against such as you and the Scribes, you cannot deceive. And you Teachers that say the Scripture is your rule, and are seperate from these two Mothers and her Children, before mentioned, and which say you must observe the commands of Christ as ordinances, and are zealous of the outward com∣mands, as the Iews was, and yet ye do not believe that Jesus Christ doth enlighten every one that comes into the world; here you and your zeal are to be candemned, for it is without the knowledg of God; to it I bear record eternally, and the commands of Christ you know not, and with the Light which comes from Christ Jesus, you and your zeal is to be condemned, which is taken on from the Letter, in that mind and na∣ture which acteth contrary to the Light, so you are in that state of the Scribes, whose mouth must be stopped. FINIS.
