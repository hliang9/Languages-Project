LOe here's the Authors Shadow, passe it by; These Lines his Substance, will in Part descry. Gaze not upon his Shade unlesse to see, And learne thereby, that all Men Sha∣dowes be.
All flesh is Grass, the best men vanity; This, but a shadow, here before thine eye, Of him, whose wondrous changes clearly show, That GOD, not men, swayes all things here below

Your Eternally Obliged Friend and Servant WILLIAM PRYNNE.

A POETICALL DESCRIP∣tion of Mount-Orgueil Castle in the Isle of Iersy, interlaced, with some briefe Meditations from it's rockie, steepe, and lofty Situation. MOunt Orgueil Castle is a lofty pile, Within the Easterne parts of Jersy Isle, Seated upon a Rocke, full large & high, Close by the Sea-shore, next to Nor∣mandie; Neere to a Sandy Bay, where boats doe ride Within a Peere, safe both from Wind and Tide. Three parts thereof the flowing Seas surround, The fourth (North-west-wards) is firme rockie ground. A proud High-mount it hath, a Rampeir long, Foure gates, foure Posternes, Bulworkes, Sconces strong, All built with Stone, on which there mounted lye, Fifteene cast peeces of Artillery; With sundry Murdering Chambers, planted so, As best may fence it selfe, and hurt a foe. A Guard of Souldiers (strong enough till warre Begins to thunder) in it lodged are;
Who watch and ward it duly night and day; For which the King allow's them Monthly pay. The Governour, if present, here doth lye, If absent, his Lievetenant deputy. F. H. A man of Warre the keyes doth keepe, and locke The Gates each night of this high towering Rock. The Castle's ample, Aire healthy, and The Prospect pleasant, both by Sea and Land. Two boystrous foes, sometimes assault with losse This Fortresse, which their progresse seemes to crosse. The Raging waves below, which ever dash Themselves in pieces, whiles with it they clash, The Stormy winds above, whose blasts doe breake Themselves, not it, for which they are too weake. For why this fort is built upon a Rocke, And so byMat. 7, 24, 25. Christs owne verdict free from shocke Of floods and winds; which on it oft may beate, Yet never shake it, but themselves defeate.

A Rocke too high for floods to reach; too strong, Too firme for fiercest winds to shake, though long They beate upon it, with a roaring sound, And blustring stormes, to cast it to the ground.

How much more then with wonder and amaze Should we upon those Massie high Rockes gaze Which them so far in Bulk, weight, height exceed, And may true admiration in us breed Of Gods Almighty Power, which could raise Such grand, rare, lasting Trophies to his praise.

BY WILLIAM PRYNNE, Late Exile and Close Prisoner in Mount-Orgueil Castle in the Isle of Iersy. Psalme 104. 24. 25. 26. O Lord how manifold are thy Workes! in Wisedome hast thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy Riches. So is this great and wide SEA, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small & great beasts. There goe the Shippes; there is that Leviathan thou hast made to play therein. Psal. 77. 19. Thy way is in the SEA, and thy path in the GREAT WATERS, and thy footesteps are not knowne. Isaiah 43. 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee O Israel; Feare not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the WATERS I will be with thee, and through the RIVERS, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour, &c. Psalme 66. 12. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through FIRE and through WATER, but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. London Printed by T. Cotes, for Michael Sparke dwelling at the blue Bible in Greene Arbor. 1641.

Hence he with sighes, teares, cries,Job 14. 1. 2. c. 3. 3. to 26. laments in vaine, As soone as borne, what he must here sustaine: O let us then withLuk. 2. 29. 30. Gen. 46. 30. Job 3. 3. to 10. Rev. 22. 20. songs and shouts of joy Leave this worlds Sea, which doth us sore annoy: And sith we enter it with teares, cries, paine, Its madnesse thus to part from it againe.
What we with force, griefe, sobs, first undertake; We should withPhil. 1. 20. 23. 2. Cor. 5 2. 31. 5. Rom. 8. 22. 23. chearefull hearts at last forsake. Like ships, which gladly runne themselves a shore; Because perforce lanch'd into Seas before. And yet the most with greaterPsal. 55. 4. 116. 3. griefe (O Sinne!) Depart this world, than they it entred in, And must by might, with grones, teares, shreekes and cry Be puld out thence, and forc'd with woe to dye. Blessed Lord God, so steare our ships and Helme Through this worlds Sea, which would us over∣whelme, And wrecke for ever, that we may at last Gaine Heav'ns blest Port, and there sure Anchor cast. Meditations of the sixth Sort. IN fine, the Sea suggests to each good mind These Meditations which are yet behind. 1. First, when we see the Sea, it readily Presents that vow and1 Cor. 10. 2. 1 Pet. 3. 21. Baptisme to our eye, Which make us Christians, and oblige us still The1 Joh. 2. 15. 16. 17. World, Flesh, Devill, with their Pompe, Lusts, will
Quite to renounce; and ever to obey Gods holy Lawes, who washt our sinnes away In these Baptismall waters; to theRom. 6. 1. to 20. c. 14. 7. 8. Luk. 1. 74. 75. Gal. 1. 4. end That we by sinning should no more offend His Sacred goodnesse, but spend all our dayes In just, good, holy actions, to his praise. O then when ever we the waters see Let these things to our mindes recalled be, To mend our Lives, renue our vowes, and make Us World, Flesh, Devill, and their Lusts forsake. 2. Crosse-Seas whose boisterous Tydes by turnes ore∣sway Each other, and enforce their streames to stray Quite from their proper course, and over-beare Them so, that they their motions counter-steare To that course they intend; in lively wise A Newborne Christians state unto our Eyes Present, in whom twoGal 5. 16. 17. 18. Rom. 7. 13. to 25. Crosse Seas, Tydes contend And meete each day, contesting without end To over-beare each other: Sometimes the Floods of their fleshly Lusts prevailers be, And over-beare the Spirits counter-tydes, Which at the last prevaile, put flesh besides Its course and channell, and through heav'ns great might Beare downe its streames, and over-comes them quite. 3. The floating Sea when it invades the Land, And drownes the Coasts that next unto it stand;
Paints out thatGen. 7. & 8. 2 Pet. 2. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 20. deluge in the dayes of Noy Which did the wicked old world quite destroy. And then instructs us with all care to flye Those sinnes which1 Tim. 6. 9. 10. Rev. 20. 10. c. 21. 8. c. 19. 20. drowne us for eternitie, Both Soule and Body in the fiery Lake. This thought should move us, all sinnes to forsake. 4. When we behold men, goods, lead, stones,Exod. 15. 5. 10. sinke downe Into the Sea, which them doth quickely drowne So deepe, that they can never rise againe: It paints forth Hell unto us very plaine, That sinkes,Revel. 19. 20. c. 20. 10. c. 21. 8. Mat. 25. 41. 42. drownes, tortures, for eternity Mens soules and bodies, which there chained lye, So fast, so deepe, that they can never rise, Nor swim out thence: Which should us all advise, To flye all sinnes; yea, more to feare and minde This fiery Lake, whence none redemption finde. And sith all feare in Seas for to be drown'd, How should they dread this Lake, thats more pro∣found. 5. The Sands on Sea-shores, which doe farre surpasse AllGen. 22. 15. c. 32. 12. Josh. 11. 4. 1 King. 7. 20. 29. number, shewes us like a Christ all glasse Those multitudes of sinnes that in us breed Which doe theJob. 6. 3. Psal. 40. 10. Sands in number farre exceede, To make us humble. And each flowing Tide, Which doth the Sand both moysten, drowne and hide From time to time, instructs us every day, With Floods ofPsal. 6. 6. Jer. 9. 1. 18. Lam. 2. 10. 18. teares our sinnes to wash away;
And in Christs1 Joh. 1. 7. Mich. 7. 19. blood them so to drowne, and hide, Through Faith, that they may be no more espide. If thus we thinke, learne, doe, by what we see, From day to day, thrice happie shall we be. 6. The springing Tide which by degrees doth flow To Full-Sea marke, and then by steps falls low, With ships first built, then lanch'd, next rigd, then sent And put to Sea, till they be wreckt or spent: Paint out MansJob 7. & 14. birth, growth, age, death to our sight, With all those Floodes, Ebbes, changes that doe lite Upon him from the wombe unto his Urne, Where he meereGen. 3. 19.

Josh. c. 3. to c. 14. Judg. c. 1. to 15. Flood of woes and mischiefes they beget, Wherein they drowne themselves and many more; And then, too late, their dismall Fates deplore. Let Kings and Grandees then take speciall heede, How they their fined Bounds breake, or exceede. 10. The Sea below doth ever flow Ebbe move, AsPsal. 104. 6. to 14. c. 107. 25. 26. 29. God himselfe doth steare it from above: So men on Earth, their thoughts, words, acts should frame And Guide, asPsal. 119. 9. Gal. 6. 16. God above directs the same.
11. Now waters ever stinke or putrifie Whiles they within theirPsal. 104. 6. to 14. Channels move, and lie: But once remov'd out of their proper place, Or let lye still, they stinke, and lose their grace. Thus men doe seldome rot in sinnes, lusts, vice Whilst they their2 Thes. 3. 6. to 14. Rom. 12. 6. 7. 8. honest calling, exercise And keepe within their Compasse. But if they GrowEzech. 16. 49. 1 Tim. 5. 12. 13. 2 Thes. 3. 6. to 13.

O then beware of sleepe and idlenesse WhichEzech. 16. 45. 50. rot and Slay the Soules they once possesse. 12. When I perceive the Seas sweete flowing tyde Upon the drie Sands, shores to creepe, steale, glide By senselesse steps, untill it drowne them quite: It represents unto my thoughts, minde, sight, Howsinnes and vices byHeb. 3. 12. 13.

The Ebbing Sea which all its filth behinde Leaves on the shore; should put all men in minde
How their Ebbes, and afflictions should still make Them all their filth of sinne quite toRev. 7. 14. Dan. 11. 35. Isa. 1. 25. forsake; Which being once cast up upon the shore, MustPsal. 85. 8.

When I behold Our Females wash away With water, all blacke spots of Inke, Soote, Clay, Which on their faces fall by accident, I wonder much, and cannot but lament To see some spot their faces studiously With Anticke Patches of a Sable dye; Should God himselfe their visage thus bespot They would repute it an uncomely Blot A great dishonor, and use all their skill To cure, or hide such blacke spots, Moles as ill: How dare they then use Artificiall spots Which they, if native, would repute for blots And deeme a blemish to their beauty, nay A sad ill Omen? May I not then say Deut. 32. 5.

To weare white LinnenJude 23. spotted, is disgrace, What is it then to weare a spotted Face, And that in Gods owne presence? Certainely It cannot but be sinne or infamie. A Spotlesse Soule abhorres aJob 11. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 19. spotted Face Which where all's cleane within, can have no place

The Sea in Calmes, and where no Rockes, Shelves lye, To crosse its course, runnes smooth without waves, cry; But crost by winds, stormes, rockes, sands, instantly It swells, roares, fumes, and rageth furiously Beyond all measure, caring not to split And breake it selfe 'gainst Rockes that hinder it: Thus many men who seeme milde, meek and sweete Of Nature, whiles they with no windes, rubbes meete Which Crosse their Wills, designes, swell fome, 1 King. 13. 4. Dan. 3. 11. to 23. rage, fret, Storme, and all rules of reason quite forget. Oft in a moment, when crost in their will Aymes, Endes, Lusts, Causes, whether good or ill; And like some furious, Bedlams, voyd of wit, Will in their fits of cholor rather split And wrecke themselves for ever, than not have Their wills in all things, which they seeke or crave. This Bedlam fury doth too oft undoe Those it possesseth, if not lookt unto In time, and quite subdude, especially Great men, or those who would be climbing high. Let all them flye it: 'tis mens shame to be As mad, rash, raging, as the Sencelesse Sea; And to permit their stations to transport Them past the bounds of reason, in this sort. 19. When I behold men with much toyle to row, And beate the Seas oft-times when crosse winds blow,
Or tydes against them runne till they with paine Their wished Haven at the last obtaine. It mindes me how all Christians while below In this worlds Sea,Luk. 13. 24. should dayly strive and row, Against all winds, Tydes, Stormes, which crosse or drive Them from Heavens Port, till they therein arrive In safety: which blest Harbor none can gaine Without much1 Cor. 9. 24 25. 26. 27. labour, rowing; sweat, and paine. 20. Its dangerous crossing of the Seas at night; When neither Sunne, Moone, Starres yeeld any light. Hence most ships in the night are cast away For want of light, when few are wreckt by day; This worlds Seas are most dangerous, specially In darkest Nights, when no light from on high Of saving Grace orJoh. 11. 9. 10. Hos. 4. 6. Mar. 15. 14. 1 Joh. 2. 11. Joh. 12. 35. knowledge doth appeare Within mens soules, whereby their course to steare. Needes must men perish then for want of light To shunne Rockes, Shelves, and guide their ships aright. We should then for this light of Grace more pray And long, thanAct. 27. 29. Seamen in a storme for Day. 21. The deepest Seas run silent without noyse When as the shallow, roare, lift up their voyce; With horrid rage and out-cry. So we see The deepest, wisest men most silent be, Making least noyse or bragges, andPsal. 39. 1. 2. 9. patiently Ʋnder all stormes and Crosses quiet lye.
When shallow Pates like1 Cor. 13. 1. empty vessels make The greatest noyse, bragges, and most on them take; And being crost, pincht with adversity, Isa. 59. 11. c. 57. 20. 21. Roare, rage, storme, vex like Bedlams furiously. To bragge, vaunt, rage, foame, chafe and over-prate, Is a sure Symptome of a shallow Pate. 22. Whiles that the Sun-beames on the Sea shine bright They make her shine so, that she bleares the sight And eyes of men, with those meere borrowed Rayes Which she reflects, and so to them conveyes: But let the Sunne set, or a cloud it hide, Her shining Luster's gone, and not espide; When as the Sun-shine of prosperity Breakes out on this1 Joh. 15. 2. 15. 16. 17. worlds Sea, it bleares the eye Of Carnall men, and makes her shine so bright That nought to them seemes halfe so cleare, or light, Though all her Lustre be but borrowed Rayes, Which1 Cor. 7. 31.

Here he arose againe from death: and then Appear'd there first to Mary Magdalen. Winning the field of Deaths, Sinnes, Devils Host, In that same place where Adam first it lost: And there triumphed over all this Sect, Where they their Trophies did at first erect. Needs must our Gardens then be very sweet, And pleasant, where these acts of Christ all meet: Which rightly pondred by us, in a trice, Would change each Garden to a Paradise, And make us see, that we by Christ gaine more In Gardens now, than Adam lost before. Sweet Jesus when a Garden we espie Rap thou our soules into an extasie. With these, or such like pious Thoughts; that we An Eden in each Garden-plot may see; And feele a blessed Heaven still to grow, Within our soules, whiles we are here below.

AGaine, in Gardens we may view and find A lively map and picture of mankind; And day by day both in them read and see The story of our selves, and what we bee. 1.

Till it be quickned formed and made fit To come into the World, and breake from it. 2. Each seed, root, plant we see in Gardens spring, And peepe out of the earth, doth sweetly bring Unto our mindes, and shadowes to our eyes Mans birth into this world, in lively-wise: WhoGen. 38. 28, 29. 30. breakes, and creepes out from his mothers wombe, Like seede out of the earth, that he may come Into this wretched world, whose misery As soone as borne, still makes him weepe and cry. 3.

Then ever they enjoy'd; and gaine farre more By rising, than by death they lost before. O let this arme us against all the feare Of death or grave, and still us joy and cheare. 12. When wee behold somePs. 90. 5, 6. Ps. 103. 15. 16.

Let younglings then, as well as old prepare For death, from whichIsa. 40. 6, 7, 8. Heb. 9. 27. none un-exempted are. 13. When as we view thePsal. 103. 15, 16. Isa. 40. 6, 7, 8. Job. 14. 1, 2. Isa. 28. 1. 4. Jam. 1. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 24. bravest, fairest flowers Cropt, blasted, withred, vanisht in few houres: We may therefrom contemplate, how that wee By suddaine death oft blasted, withred be, Cropt off, consumed in few minutes space, Even in the flowre, prime, pride, choyce, vigour, grace Of all our dayes, whenIsa. 28. 15. 18. death from us did seeme The farthest off, and we did not once dreame Of its approach. A truth we daily see, Which should teach youth, for death prepard to be. 14, The ripe fruits, seedes which wee in gardens view, Pluckt off, and gathered; clearly to us shew
HowJob. 5. 26. men of ripe yeares, are most commonly, Pul'd off by death, and so should looke to dye, At least as soone as ripe, if not before, Sith then they stand neere unto grim deaths doore, Whom if he spare to pull or shake downe, they Will of themselves in short space fall away, And drop into his mouth. Let then all such StandJob. 14. 14. Gen. 27. 2. still prepar'd for death, who doth them touch. 15.

Each Garden in the yeares foure seasons paints Forth to our eyes, and us full well acquaints With mans foure ages, which doe comprehend The whole race of his life, untill it end. InPsal. 38. 35, 36. Ps. 92. 7. spring time they depaint our infancie, And younger yeares: in summer they descry Our youthfull flowring age. In Autumne they Our riper yeares, and drooping age display; InIsa. 1. 30. Ezech. 17. 9, 10. Psal. 102. 4. 11. winter when they shriveled, naked are, And all amort, decayd: they then declare Our old decrepid, withred, dying yeares, When, all within us, dead, nought fresh appeares, Wee can no time then in our gardens be, But wee our selves may there read, know, view, see,
By contemplation, in more compleat wise Than in all pictures painters can devise. O let us view our selves in this bright glasse Each day, andPsal. 90. 9, 10. see there how our ages passe, And slit away, untill wee wither, dye; ToDeut 32. 29. mind us still of our mortality: 17. Besides, by meditation we may hence Behold, mind, know our state of innocence Before our fall: since God didCen. 2. 8. to 17. Adam place In Edens garden, in a state of Grace, And Innocence, it both to keepe and dresse, Where he not long enjoy'd this happinesse. 18. Yea, in our Gardens we may read and eye Our fall and state of sinne and misery, Sith we inGen. 3. Rom. 5. 8, 9. &c. Edens Garden caught that fall Through Adams sinne, which did undoe us all, AndRom. 7. 8. to 25. c. 9. 12. plunge us into such a woefull state Of sinne, and vice, as makes God us to hate; And dailyRom. 1. 25. to 32. c. 7, 8, to 25. Jam. 1. 13, 14, 15. spurres us unto all excesse Of horrid sinnes, and monstrous wickednesse; WhichPsal. 9. 17. Mat. 25. 41. 46. cast us headlong into hell, and make Ʋs nought but fuell for that fiery Lake, A dismall state indeed, whose thought should rent Our stony hearts, and cause them to relent. 19. But not dispaire, sith in this very place Christ hath restored us to a state of grace,
Of which it minds us, all sad hearts to cheare, And us from our collapsed state helpe reare. For as Christ in aJoh. 18. 1. to 16. c. 19. 41, 42. c. 20. 1. to 17. Rom. 4, 25. 1 Cor. 15. throughout. 2 Cor. 4. 14. Eph. 2. 10. Garden was betrayd, And dead, there in a new sepulcher laid, So did he there from death rise up againe, And thereby rais'd up all his chosen traine, From their lost, lapsed, to a blessed state Of grace and glory. O then celebrate, And ever blesse, praise, love, serve Christ, who thus Hath rais'd, redeem'd, restor'd, exalted us: And let each Garden put us still in mind Of these three states belonging to mankind, Without whose perfect knowledge, view, and sight, We cannot know God, nor our selves aright. 20. Each weed which wee in gardens see to grow, Our sinfull state, and seedes of vice us shew, Both fromGen 3. 17, 18, 19. mans fall in Eden first did spring, And sighs,Gen. 3. 1, 2. 1 King. 11. 1, to 10. 2 Chron. 21. 1, to 12. 2 Tim. 2. 17. c. 3. 1. to 9. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Col. 2. 8. Act. 20. 29, 30. groanes, teares, should from our hard hearts wring, 21. We see the fattest Garden ground still breeds The largest, rankest bryers,Prov. 24. 31. Isa. 39. 13. Zeph. 2. 9. Hos. 9 6. nettles, weedes: So greatest sinnes, crimes, vices usually, In men of greatest parts, wit, dignity, And in the richest persons, Natures grow, Not in the vulgar meaner sort below. The pregnant wits, best Natures voyd of grace, Are greatest sinnes, crimes, vices common place. O trust not then toEph. 2. 1, 2, 3. c. 4. 17, 18, 19. Rom. 1. 24. to 32. Job. 15. 16.

What? shall our gardens, fruitfull, usefull be, Stor'd with all good fruits, herbes, rootes? and yet wee Be barren, fruitlesse, void of vertue, grace, And nought but lust, vice, weeds in us have place? O shame! O sinne! let gardens teach us then, Now to prove fertile, good and gracious men. 23. Each GardensCant 2. 12, 3. Hosea 14. 16, 7.

24. The suddaine blasts and winters which befall Our Gardens, andPs. 103. 15, 16. Isa. 0. 6. 7. 8. decay or strip of all Their lustre, beauty, flowers, fruits, represent Unto our eyes and minds; that discontent, Diseases, crosses, losses, which oft blast Decay, consume, dry up, spoyle, and lay wast Mens bodies, fortunes, states, and in short space Leave them weake,Job. 1. & 2. & 3. see k. be∣fore. naked, in most wretched case. A truth we daily see. Let none then blesse Himselfe, or trust in worldly happinesse, Which every crosse, storme, sicknesse will decay; And when our winter comes will fade away. 25.

What though they cannot now them feele or eye; Wait but a while, and they shall them discry. It will not still be winter,Cant. 2. 11, 12, 13. Hos. 14. 5, 6. Isa. 60. 1. Eph. 5. 14. spring is neere; If not before, yet then they will appeare, In greater lustre, vigor than before.

Hence may each Church, St further learn to cheere; Steele, arme themselves against all future feare Of winter stormes, blasts, tryalls which may shake Their leaves, fruits, stalks down to the earth, & make Them in appearance livelesse, voyd of grace, And in a wretched, helpelesse, hopelesse case, Like Gardens in cold winters: But yet shall This daunt their faith, or make their hope quite fal? O no! this winter lasts but for a space, And then succeeds a blessed spring of grace;
Which shall revive, refresh, repaire, restore; Yea much increase, what seem'd dead, lost before, As it did untoJob 42. 10, to 17. Job, whose latter end His first estate in blisse did farre transcend: O then, what ever be thy case,Mic. 7. 8, 9, 10. Ps. 27. 14. Ps. 37. 5, 6, 7, 34. 39. 40. Ps. 40. 1, 2, 3.

Hence may all raging Persecutors see, That their attempts against Christs Church, Saints, be Vaine, bootlesse, senselesse,Exod. 1. 10, 11, 12, &c.

And makes the malice of our enemies, The spring from whence our greatest Comforts rise? O what besotted, sencelesse fooles are those Who Gods true Church, & chosen Saints oppose!

In winter season we can hardly know, Dead Garden plants from living; sith in shew
They both seeme dead and withered to the eye; But when as Summer comes, we presently Discerne the dead from those that are alive, Because the oneJude 12. sprouts not, the other thrive: Cant. 2. 11, 12, 13.

For shame then let us all this fault amend Hereafter, and our Hearts, Mindes, fully bend To godly Meditations, whiles we passe Our time in Gardens, where each flower, herbe, grasse And Creature we behold, will soone suggest Some vsefull Thoughts to every pious Breast, It to amend, and with sweete Extasies To elevate above the starry skies.

How many daily the whole morning passe, And vainly spend, betweene the Combe and Glasse, In combing, frizling, powdring of their haire, And wanton lockes, to make them seeme more faire? No Locke, or haire must out of order stand, But sit in Print, and oft be view'd, curl'd, scand. Nay, which is strange, more cost, time, now is spent Upon false Bushes of bought excrement, (Which some preferre before their native fleece,) Than upon mee, mans honour, Master-peece; When this is done, the Backe, Necke, Feete, Hands, Face, And other parts must have their severall space For to adorne them, so as halfe che day

COMFORTABLE CORDIALS, AGAINST DISCOMFORTABLE Feares of Imprisonment, and other suf∣ferings in good causes. Containing some Latine Verses, Sentences, and Texts of Scripture, written by Mr. WILLIAM PRYNNE on his Chamber walles in the Tower of London, during his Imprisonment there; since Translated by him into Eng∣lish VERSE. 2 CORINTHIANS 1, 2, 3 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that wee may bee able to comfort them which are in any troubles by the comfort wherewith we our selves are comfort∣ed of God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our con∣solation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether wee be afflicted, it is for your consolation, & salvation which is effectuall in enduring of the same sufferings, which we also suffered: or whether wee bee comforted it is for your consolation and salvation. And our hope of you is stedfast; knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you shall be of the consolation. For we would not, Brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above strength, in so much that wee despaired even of life. But we had the sentence of death in our selves that we should not trust in our selves but in God which rais∣eth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death and doth deli∣ver, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us: you also helping together by Prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us, by the meanes of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

TO THE RIGHT VVOR∣Shipfull his very Noble and highly Honoured good Friend, SIR WILLIAM BALFORE Knight, Lievtenant of the Tower of LONDON. SIR, it were Ingratitude and Injury, For me in silence here to passe you by, And not present these Cordialls unto you, Sith they, and all my service are your due, For all your Noble Favours in the Tower, Which have ingag'd me to my utmost power, To be your eternally devoted poore Friend and servant, WILLIAM PRYNNE.
COMFORTABLE CORDIALLS, OR Latine Verses and Sentences, written by Mr. William Prynne on his Chamber Walls in the Tower of London, during his Imprisonment there; Since tran∣slated into English by him. 1. TRanslulit in Coelum Christi praesentia Claustrum: Quid faciet Coelo, quae Coelum jam creat Antro? Christs presence hath my Prison turn'd into A blessed Heaven; what then will it doe In Heav'n hereafter, when it now creates Heav'n in a Dungeon? Goales, to Courts translates? 2. Stigmata Christicolis, splendentia sidera; sanguis,

Optima cuncta piis, Tristissima sola ministrant; Vnica Crux sanctis, Via, Ianua, summa salutis. Brands, unto Christians are bright Starres; Blood spent, A Royall Purple; Maym'd Limbes, Ornament; Bonds, Chaines of Pearle; Reproaches, Praise (no staine) Wounds, Martyrdome; Death, Life; Oppressions, Gaine. To godly men the saddest fates only All best things bring, and their joyes multiply; The Crosse alone to Saints is the high way, Gate, summe of safety, Meanes of endlesse Joy: 3.

O fortunatus, cui Con-captivus Iësus, Laetificans radiis tristissima Claustra supernis; Vincula non illum, Tormenta, gravamina moestum Efficiunt, animum retinentem utcunque serenum. Christ every where accompanies good Men; He goes with them into the Prisons Den; The Towers, thickest Walls broad ditches, Gates,
Of Iron, Barracadoes, Flames and Grates Doth boldly passe through; proves Companion, Friend, solace, all things of himselfe alone; Vnto close Prisoners and fills plenteously The thirsty soules of his, with heavenly Delights.John 20: 19. Hee entered in the dores fast shut To his Disciples, them to comfort; but With godly prisoners he's a constant guesse Resides; O happie he who doth possesse Christ for his Fellow-prisoner, who doth gladde With heavenly Sunbeames, Goales that are most sad, Bonds, Torments, Prisons, make not him sad; he Retaines a quiet mind how ere things be. 4. Nullatenus vinctus Christi virtute solutus; Permanet immunis, clusus vel Carcere Vinclis. Liber ubique, pius, placidus, benedictus, amoenus, Indomitus; tacitum circumfert pectore Coelum: Tristia Laetificans, Moestissima cuucta serenans; Vincula discutiens, arctissima claustra recludens. He is not bound whom CHRIST hath made free; he Though shut close Prisoner, chaind, remains still free, A godly Man's at large in every place, Still chearefull, well content, in blessed case, Vnconquer'd; he a secret Heaven still beares About within his brest, which sad things cheares, Dispells his blackest cloudes of griefe, off shakes His chaines; and closest prisons open makes. 5. Vincula non Animam cohibent, haud carcere clusam: Sidera transvolitat, Terram, Mare, cuncta pererrat Alipes, immensi fines transcendit Olympi; Limitis impatiens, arctari nescia Mundi
Cancellis; tantum requiescens Numine vasto; Securus, placidusque Piis, vel turbine, Portus; No bands the soule of Man can once restraine; No Prison it inclose, nor yet containe; It soares above the Starres, and swiftly flyes O're Earth, Sea, all things; mounts beyond the skies, And bounds of the vast Heav'ns, impatient Of Limits, ignorant how to be pent Within the Rayles of this whole world; onely Resting within the boundlesse Deity; A secure, pleasant harbour to Godly Men, even in a storme of Misery. 6.

When as Brands, Scarres, and Croppings farre more dight A Christians eares, and make them shine more bright. O Matchlesse Glory, Woundes which Christ expresse!

Suffering's their▪ Alpha who to Heaven tend; But Joy is their Omega, finall end; Their Entrance is adorn'd with teares of Woe, Their end with Triumphs, which their griefes outgo. 9. Nil Crus sentit in Nervo, si Anima sit in Coel.
The Legg feeles nothing in the stockes, if the Soule, minde, Affections in Heav'n placed be. 10. Non timet is carcerem, qui scit contemnere Libertatem, Vitam, voluptatem, Famam: cui Mundus Ergastulum, Terra Exilium, Deus habitaculum, Mors Solatium. He feares no prison who knowes to despise Freedome, Life, pleasure, Fame, which others prise: To whom this world's a prison; Earth, a place Of Exile, God, a Mansion; Death, Solace. 11. Servus Christi etiam in vinculis, Liber. Servus Peccati etiam in summa Libertate captivus. Christs Servants even in prison are still free: Sinnes, in the greatest freedome, captives bee. 12. Nil corpus patitur in Ergastulo, si Animus sit in Coelo. The body suffers nought in prison, when The mind it selfe is lodged in Heaven. 13. Quid Coelum sine Deo, nisi Barathrum? Quid Barathum eum Deo nisi Coelum? What's Heav'n without God but a very Hell? What's Hell but a Heav'n, if God once there dwell? 14. Nullibi incarceratur, qui ubique in Christo liberatur: Nunquam dejicitur, qui semper à Jehova sustentatur. He in no place can once imprisoned be, Who in all places isJoh. 8. 36.

Nusquam solus qui ubique cum Deo; Nunquam Miser quisemper cum Christo, He never is alone, who every where Hath God himselfe, him company to beare, He never can be miserable, who Is alwayes with Christ, who doth with him goe. 16. Vbi Deus adest, ibi non est Carcer, sed Paradisus; Non Ergastulum, Sed Palatium; non Barathrum, sed Coelum. Where God is present, there no Prison is, But a sweet Paradise of Joy and blisse; No Bridewell, but a Palace; no darke Cell, But a bright Heaven, where all comforts dwell. 17. Carcer probat Amies, detegit Iuimicos; Excludit Mundum, includit Deum: Alit virtutes, extinguit Libidines, Edocet Temperantiam; cohibet Luxuriam; Mortificat earnem, sanctificat hominem; Ingenerat gratiam, the saurizat Gloriam. A prison tries▪ Mens friends, detects their Foes, Shuts out the world, God to men doth inclose; Nourisheth vertues, Lusts extinguisheth; Temperance teacheth, Riot restraineth, Quite kills the flesh, but makes the Man holy; Ingenders Grace,2 Cor. 4. 17. 2 Tim. 4. 8. and ire asures up glory.

The Tower true faithfull Christians feinedly Imprisons, but them sets free verily, By putting on them Christs sweet yoake onely, To which to be subjected, is truely To be enfranchised; by shaking off The manifold, and most heavy chaines of The flesh, sinne, World, Di'le; in which for to lye Insnarde, is to be captiv'd certainely. 19.

The Tower is to most, a Spectacle; To many its a house, wherein they dwell; To some a refuge; Others, a lodging; A Royall Pallace, it is to the King; Vnto the Kingdome it's a Treasury, Armory, Bulwarke, Mint': an Oratory To Godly prisoners; but a purgatory To popish; to close ones, a Monast'ry; To guiltlesse ones, it's an Inne; to guilty
A Bridewell; to learn'd ones, it's a study; To idle ones a Dormitory; to Drunkards, a tipling-house them to undoe; To Traytors it's a shambles, where their head And Quarters hang, when they are butchered.

adjudicatur Salvò certè custoditur, quinon solùm à Deo, sed in Deo conservatur: arctari non potest, qui ipsa Dei infinitate (incarceratus) spatiatur. Ita omi∣natur Gulielmus Prynne: Martij 3. 1633. God is a Tower by protecting all His Saints from Ills, in Ills which them befall; Against, amidst ill men in every place, Most safely, strongly out of his meere grace; By comforting them in adversity Alwayes, most sweetly, most abundantly: By freeing them from evills speedily, In the best time, and that most potently: No doubt he is the happiest man alive, Who this worlds Exile, and Christs deare Captive, Is during life adjudg'd perpetually In this most safe, sweet, best great'st Tower to lye. He is truely kept safely, who both by And in God is preserv'd continually: He cannot straitned be, who walkes freely (Whiles prisoner) in Gods vast Infinity. Of this opinion WILLIAM PRYNNE was the Third day of March, six hundred thirty three. Sentences of Scriptures there likewise written. PSAL. 69. 33. The Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners. PSAL. 146. 7, 8. The Lord looseth the prisoners; the Lord raiseth those that are bowed downe.
PHIL. 4. 11, 12, 13. I have learned in whatsoever state I am, there∣with to bee content, I know both how to be abas∣ed, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am instructed, both to bee full, and to bee hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need: I can doe all things through Christ, which strengtheth mee. PSAL. 34. 17. 19. 22. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all; the Lord redeem∣eth the soule of his Servants, and none of them that trust in him, shall be desolate. PSAL. 37. 23, 24, 37, 38, 39, 40. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and hee delighteth in his way: Though hee fall, hee shall not be utterly cast downe, for the Lord uphold∣eth him with his hand: Marke the perfect man, and behold the upright: For the end of that man is peace. But the transgressours shall bee destroyed together, the end of the wicked shall bee cut off: But the sal∣vation of the righteous is of the Lord, hee is their strength in the time of trouble. And the Lord shall help them and deliver them: hee shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. PSAL. 71. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Thy righteousnesse also O God, is very high, who
hast done great things, O God who is like to thee? Thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken mee againe, and shalt bring mee up againe from the depthes of the earth. Thou shalt en∣crease my greatnesse, and comfort me on every side. I will also praise thee, with the Psaltery even thy truth: O my God unto thee will I sing with the Harpe, O thou holy one of Israel: My lips shall greatly rejoyce when I sing unto thee: and my soule which thou hast redeemed: my tongue also shall talke of thy righteousnesse all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame that seeke my hurt. MICAH: 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. A mans enemies are the men of his owne house: Therefore I will looke unto the Lord; I will waite for the God of my salvation, my God will heare mee: Rejoyce not against me ô mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise: when I sit in darknesse, the Lord shall bee a light unto mee. I will beare the indig∣nation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, untill hee plead my cause and execute judge∣ment for mee, Hee will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousnesse. Then shee that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto mee, where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall behold her, now shall she be troden downe, as the mire of the streets.

Foes sent me hence, but God, and his Saints cryes Have brought me back, 'tis wondrous in all Eyes. No Exiles, Prisons, Chaines, powers can detaine Those whom God will recall, free, raise againe.
ISAY. 51. 11. 14. c. 41. 5, 6. The redeemed of the Lord shall returne, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtaine gladnesse and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. The CAPTIVE EXILE hastneth, that hee may be loosed, and that he should not dye in the pit, nor that his bread should faile. Feare not, for I am with thee, I will bring thy seed from the East, and gather thee from the West, I will say to▪ the North, Give up; and to the South, keep not backe; bring my sonnes from farre, and my daughters from the ends of the Earth.
