THE COPY OF A LETTER SENT FROM GENERALL LEISHLEY, to the Lord Generall the Earle of HOLLAND, and read in the House of Commons, the seventh of July, M. DC. XLI. Printed in the yeare 1641.
THE LETTER FROM GENERAL LEISHLEY, To the Lord Generall, the Earle of HOLLAND. the 7. of Iuly, 1641. My Lord; I Give your Lordship hearty thankes that you have bin pleased to acquaint me with your arrivall at Yorke, I had some notice given mee before by our Commissioners of his Majesties Commands, and the desire of the Parliament, for that happie and peaceable service your Lordship is now about. I am glad that I am at Darrington by accident, in that place where I may give the more speed and incouragement, which your Lordship desireth and expects from me. This shall be done with all possible diligence; for as at the first, the reason of sending any Troopes towards the Tees, was for inlargement of their quarter, and the
great ease of the rest of the Bishoprick; now, the retyring shall be to take away all jealousie from the army of our aboade in this part of the County: for although the streightning of our quarter will be both prejudiciall to the Country and us, yet God forbid it should be made a pre∣text to make the least stay to the good worke your Lordship hath in hand; and the further wee remove from other in this end, we are the neerer to be joyned in all hearty affection for the ser∣vice of the King: wherefore so sure grounds of hope are now laid, that all his Majesties Three Kingdomes enemies will have as much cause to feare the ill effects of our Union, as they had matter of rejoycing at the too long lasting dis∣cord betweene us: And it may be so in all ages to come; which is the hearty wish and Prayer of, Your Lordships most humble Servant, Henry Leishly. Dorrington the second of July, 1641.
