THE COPIE OF A Letter sent from the Right Honorable the Lord PAGET, Lord Lieutenant of the County of BUCKINGHAM, To the Right Honorable the Earle of Holland: Shewing the great readinesse of that County, to obey the Ordinance of the Parliament, touching the MILITIA. My Lord, I Have received so great expressions from my Countrymen of Buckingham-shire, of their good affections to the Publique, and ready Obedience to the Commands of Parliament, in the present Muster this day begun for a fourth part of this County, that I held it my duty to make your Lordship acquainted there∣with, to the end an account may be given of it to the Parliament, if your Lordship shall think fit. Ten of my Deputy Lieutenants met me this morning at Beckonsfield, where we called over the Traine Band, consisting but of one hundred and fifty men, who made a very good appearance with their Armes and supplies, and as full as they have been formerly upon any other summons. Besides these, eight score Voluntiers and upwards within this Division, presented themselves to us very well armed, and exercised in two Companies; more in number then the Trained Band, summoned to this place. I am also informed of another Company of an hundred and fifty Vo∣luntiers more within this Division, that intend to shew themselves in our way to the next place of meeting, and of another Company of an hundred more, who there intend to meet us, besides the Trained Band. This publique testimony of my Countrymens good affections, for the safety of the King and Kingdome, I thought not unfit to make knowne. And rest Your Lops most dutifull son, and humble servant, VVILL: PAGET. Beckonsfield 23. May. 1642. LONDON, Printed for JOHN BULL, dwelling in Grub-street. 1642.
