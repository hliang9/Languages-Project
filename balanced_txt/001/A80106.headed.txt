A COLLECTION Of divers Papers Presented unto the Houses of Parliament By the Commissioners of SCOTLAND since May last, 1645. Published by Authority. LONDON, Printed by Moses Bell. 1645.
Ingenuous and Cour∣teous Reader. HEre I present unto thee a Collection of some Pa∣pers, of which I shall onely say that in them thou wilt finde Reason and Truth, the publish∣ing whereof I am perswaded in the first place will give content to men of judgement and in∣tegrity, concerning divers things murmured and rumored every where almost against men so well deserving in the service of this Cause of God, and of his people, and consequently a∣gainst the Cause it selfe, for which they have, and doe undergoe so much hardship, toyling care, and hazard, &c. in all these three King∣domes; not only in opposing the violence and plots of the open and declared enemy, but also in declining and stopping the undermining devices of counterfeit friends, and false brethren. In the next place it will make false-hearted and by-ended men blush for shame if they have any, as also the simpler ones acknowledge their owne sillynesse, suffering themselves thus to be deluded, and as it were led by the Nose, by the specious lyes of crafty and deceitfull men; but before thou goe to the reading of the papers themselves, give me leave to de∣taine thee a little with these ensuing lines: Of late many reproaches have been cast upon the Scots, in the pursuance of the service in this common Cause, namely for three things. First, on the one side the Malignants, that is, the enemies of Church and State, adversaries to our solemne Covenant blame the Scots, for pressing and urging the
setling of the Church-Government, to the end that all grosse Ido∣latry and Superstition, with Tyrannie may be pulled downe; as also all fanaticall errours and Heresies, with confusion may be repressed in the Church, and it preserved pure as the Spouse of Christ, according to his holy Word, and conforme to the practice of the first times, and example of the best reformed Neighbour Churches, as we are all bound by our solemne Oath; on the other side divers men of zeale, to the glory of God, and good of his people, blame the Scots, that they are too white-lipp'd, and doe not put home with vigour enough the setling of the Church, as they are conceived to have done in their owne Country, and so they are wish'd by these Zelots to make their stoutnesse more clearely appeare in this businesse of the Church, for these well-meaning men are grieved from their heart to see the setling of the Church, these five yeares in hand so slackly pur∣sued; yea in the latter times, stopped by some of those who formerly did make a shew of an earnest affection for the setling of the same as aforesaid; but now with an unparallel'd impudency doe publickly affirme, that Religion was not the first and maine quarrell betwixt the Parliament and the common enemy, against the Declaration of both Houses when they tooke Armes, and against the Declaration of both Kingdomes joyntly, and more particularly against the Na∣tionall Covenant. To this it is answered; the Scots in conscience and duty to God and his people, and particularly by solemne Oath are bound to put on the setling of the Church with all faithfulnesse and earnestnesse, and yet they have to this day proceeded therein with all meekenesse, longanimity and tendernesse, studying to gaine by faire meanes those who are so backward to the setling of the Church if it were possible. 2. The Scots on one side are blamed by those who are enemies to the setling of Government in the Church, and good order in the State, for expressing so seriously their desires of peace, the Church being setled in truth and purity, and the State secured, with due Priviledges and lawfull liberty. And on the other side, divers blame the Scots for not pressing home enough the obtaining of Peace, so much the rather that they are affraid to have a Peace, both long in comming and uncertain when it is come, except the Scots presse it, and be engaged in it. To this it is likewise answered; the Scots have undertaken war, not to make a Trade of it, but to obtaine peace, and the sconer the better
for the stopping of the torrent of wickednesses of all kinds so openly, and with so high a hand committed against God, and the wrongs done unto his people in warre; for they finde by woefull experience that the Sword is the heaviest of the three maine scourges wherewith God punisheth the children of men for their iniquities; yet they conceive the thing is to be done with judgement and discretion, for fear of surprisall, and circumvention by the common enemy, who studieth to undoe us by deceit, in making an uncertaine peace (if not preven∣ted by wisedome) since he failes in his plots and open violence by warre to destroy us. 3. The Scots are blamed that their Army hath done nothing this Summer, and hath laine heavily upon the people, yea, and put Taxes upon them, to a huge and immence value if it went through the whole Country. To this also it is answered; If the Scots have done nothing, I pray you where doth the fault lye, for they have been ever willing and ready; with us when we will have the Plough to goe, first we give meate both to man and beast; next we furnish the Plough with all instruments, as sock, culter, &c. fit for the worke: then let it be knowne with what and in what measure the Scots have been furni∣shed for any undertaking, yea, in downe-right tearmes, they have been so dealt withall, that it seemeth there hath been a set designe to keepe them from doing, and to make them odious to the people; yet they have not been idle notwithstanding their wants, for the sending of the King twice South-ward, and the breaking his Northerne design is as advantagious to the main service of the common Cause as any thing hath been done any where this yeare; all wise and judicious men doe acknowledge and confesse this. To lay aside divers other particulars done by the Scots this yeare, but as for the Taxes or Asses∣ments, said to be against the liberty of the people, it is answered; that first they are moderate, and reach no further then the places nearest unto their quarters, not going through the whole Coun∣try, as some doe seeme to intimate in their letters; then if it be against the liberty of the people without Ordinance from Autho∣rity to lay Assesments upon the Country, it is against the nature of men to live upon nothing, or starve till Order from Authority come. Againe, I pray you whether or not is it more convenient for the people that moderate Assesments should be laid upon them, then that the Souldier driven by necessity should take at discretion. Fur∣ther,
whether or not is it better for keeping an Army of foot for the good of the people to have a set Taxe paid and appointed in a place, then to run up and downe at all times for provisions; are not the forces in the West driven to the same exigencies for want of pay? yea, some of late although they have been formerly with care lookt unto, have abandoned their Colours and run away: yet I am sure if the Scots Army had the fourth part of pay that the Westerne hath had this Summer, they would render ten for one for any thing that should be taken from the people, of this they have given evidence enough by their former carriage in this Kingdome: moreover, they have frequently and earnestly solicited for pay to fit them for action, and keepe them from being troublesome to the people; and since they speake of liberty, I pray you if the Scots had not come in where had the liberty been, and where had the Parliament been siting for judgeing of the liberty of the people? Is it not knowne to all that the Parliament is Assembled at the occasion of the in-coming of the Scots, then the Court Plots against the Parliament were disappointed by reason of the being of the Scots Army in England Thirdly, the Scots being solicited by the Court upon great promises to side with it against the Parliament, not onely refused to doe it as most base, but also gave notice of it to the Parliament with assuranee of their service. Lastly, if the Scots had not come in when they came, where had the liberty of the Parliament and people been ere now. After all this, some malicious men studying to advance their worldly condition and private ends, by confusion in the Church, and disorder in the State, doe what they can to give a distaste to Parliament, City, and Country of the Scots, but in vaine, for as sure as the malicious calumnies of Papists, and Prelates, with their adherents hath come to nothing, and their devices fallen upon their owne heads; so without doubt ere it be long these enemies to the setling of the Church of God with their wickednesse and pride, will fall to the ground notwithstanding all their cun∣ning and craft, for nothing can subsist but truth and honesty.
A Collection of divers Papers given in to the two Houses of Parliament by the Commis∣sioners of Scotland. THe sense of the goodnesse of God in the late vi∣ctory granted to the Forces of the Parliament, the experience of all ages wherein the greatest and most sudden victories, have through securi∣ty or negligence so far miscarried, that they have proved either hurtfull or unprofitable; and the desires we have that this present victory may be thankfully and wisely im∣proved to the honour of God and the publike good; have con∣strained us humbly to offer our thoughts and desires about this matter of so great weight and consequence, that by this hono∣rable Committee they may be represented to the honourable Houses of Parliament. First we desire, that unto the publike and solemn thanks gi∣ving already offered unto God, there may succeed a publike and reall testimony of thankfulnesse in the speedy setling of Religion and the House of God, wherein his glory and ho∣nour is neerely concerned; no monument or Trophee of vi∣ctory can be so pleasant in his sight; nothing will more con∣firme and incourage all good Christians at home, and comfort and satisfie all the Protestant Churches abroad; no means will be more effectuall for setling of unstable minds, for curing and
preventing of Sects, Schismes and Heres es, and for stopping the mouthes, and shaming the faces of such as have not been ashamed to say; That the Parliament in policy pretendeth re∣ligion, but doth not really intend it, and thereby draw many Disciples after them. Secondly, least victories run continually in a vicissitude, as they have at some times done formerly, which is not onely a signe but a means of the continuance of this unnaturall warre; we desire that presently, while the iron is hot, and before the Enemy gather strength againe, course may be taken by the joint Councels and forces of both Kingdomes, for the speeedy vigorous and constant prosecuting of the war, that by the bles∣sing of God it may at last be brought to an end, and nothing may be left undone which may be a meanes to deliver these Kingdomes from their present sad condition, under the heavy hand of God. Thirdly, we humbly move and desire it may be considered, whether the present condition of the Kings Army, and the blessing of God upon the Parliaments forces, both of them joyned, make not an opportunity and such a season as is very desirable for renewing the desires of the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, in the most convenient and conduceable way for a just and well grounded Peace. Thus apprehending all occasi∣ons of demanding Peace, it will appeare, that although War be necessarily in our hand, yet Peace is in our heart, and that we follow not War as a trade, or for it selfe, but as a means of Peace. If it shall please God to move the Kings heart to listen unto our just and necessary desires, our troubles are at an end, and we may sit downe in peace: But if God shall so far desert the King, that he will still prefer the pernitious and destructive suggestions of wicked men, unto the Counsels of the Parlia∣ments of both Kingdoms; In that case we may say before God, our owne consciences and the world, that we have delivered our owne souls, our Enemies will be convinced that peace is
our desires, our friends will extend themselves to the mainte∣nance of a necessary war, and the Armies of both Kingdomes will doe duty with the greater resolution and courage, when they see no other remedy, which may be a means upon this side to bring the war to a speedy and happy conclusion. These our motions & desires, we humbly present to be seri∣ously considered by the wisdome of the honourable Houses, that the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, being now about his journey into that Kingdome, may be acquainted with their resolutions, and may make the same knowne unto the Scot∣tish Army in this Kingdome, and to the Parliament of Scot∣land, that all matters, whether of Peace or Warre, may still proceed with the consent of both Kingdomes. 20 June, 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland. John Cheisley. HAving now seen and perused the divers Letters and Pa∣pers of great importance, mentioned in the Answer of the honourable Houses of Parliament, to our paper of the twentieth of June, which may give light to the future proceed∣ings of both Kingdoms, having also observed the good successe of the Parliaments Forces since that time, whereby the King and his Armies are brought to a much lower condition, which in Divine Providence may be a further preparation to an hap∣py Peace; and having reason from what we have learned in time past, to apprehend, that men will not be at rest, but still be dealing under hand, and tampering for a Peace of their own making, and for their owne private ends, to the great preju∣dice of the Publike, the further alienating of the Kings heart from a safe and well grounded Peace, and the delaying of the intentions of both Kingdomes; We do in all earnestnesse de∣sire,
upon the grounds and considerations presented in our former paper, to know rhe minde and resolution of both Hou∣ses in a matter of so great consequence, as is the renewing of the desires and propositions of Peace, (in such wanner as shall be thought fit,) that we may make the same knowne to the Parliament of Scotland now sitting, which may expect no lesse from our trust and diligence. 28 July, 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland. John Cheisley. THe pressing necessities of the Scottish Army doe inforce us to represent by your Lordships and these Gentlemen, to the honourable Houses of Parliament, that notwithstand∣ing the whole foure moneths of the Ordinance be long since expired, there is but a very small and inconsiderable proporti∣on of money assessed upon the severall Counties for enter∣tainment of that Army, as yet come in to the Committee of Gold-Smiths Hall, for repayment of the months pay advanced by the City of London, and for satisfying the necessities of that Army, which is reduced to that extremity in the present service wherein they are ingaged, that without Pease, Apples and greene Wheat, they gather from the ground, they are not able to subsist; some of the Counties, as Lincolne and Rutland, desire to be excused, and pretend their inability to afford any proportion of the Money assessed upon them for that Army, and little or none comes in from the rest of the Counties. It is above a twelve moneth since a moneths pay was ordered by the House to be paid to the Scottish Army out of the Fines and Compositions for Delinquents Estates, immediatly after the Battell of Longmarston, a good proportion whereof is yet due, the payment of which is obstructed by severall Orders procured from the House, for payment of Moneys for other
uses, out of those Fines and compositions. Our earnest desire to the honourable House is, That some speedy and effectuall course be taken for bringing in of the moneys due by the Counties for the foure Moneths past, that the Ordinance may speedily be renewed; that the House will be pleased to ap∣point the Committee of Gold-Smiths Hall, first to pay the re∣mainder of that moneths Pay, voted after the Battell of Long∣marston, out of the Fines and Compositions for Delinquents Estates, notwithstanding any subsequent Orders, and that the Committee of Gold-Smiths Hall may be enabled for the spee∣dy payment thereof, and other incident charges, that the House would call for their reports concerning those Fines, wherein they can proceed no further without the approbation of the Houses. 7 August, 1645. By command of the Com∣missioners for the Parliament of Scotland. Joh. Cheisley. HAving received from your Lordships some Votes of the honourable Houses concerning the Propositions of Peace, and after some conference thereupon, being desired by your Lordships to give our answer in writing, we hereby pre∣sent our thoughts, and offer it to your Lorships consideration, whether it were not fit to shun all occasions of delay, in sending the Propositions of Peace to the King, least thereby we neg∣lect the improvement of so seasonable an opportunity of ob∣taining Peace, as we have expressed in our former papers: That to this end we are most ready, presently to concurre with the honourable Houses, for sending to his Majesty the Propositions, either all, or some, as they have been already agreed upon in the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, for mat∣ter and manner: That untill we understand what Propositi∣ons are intended by the Votes of the Houses, to be next sent,
we cannot give a cleare answer anent the manner. That if the Propositions presented at Ʋxbridge, be understood with any other of those already agreed upon by both Kingdoms, which upon mutuall debate shall be adjudged most necessary for the Peace of both Kingdoms to be now sent, we shall be ready to concurre with the Honourable Houses to desire a positive answer thereof from His Majestie without any Treaty. But in case any new Propositions of Peace be thereby un∣derstood, or any materiall additions to, or alterations of the former Propositions, we shall be necessitated to send these to the Kingdome of Scotland, to be there considered and ap∣proved, as all the fotmer were; and as it is evident that wee are not the cause of this delay, so that no prejudice may thereby arise to the publike, we desire in the interim that those already agreed upon by both Kingdoms (which at the time were thought sufficient) may be presented to His Ma∣jestie with all convenient speed. Concerning the third Re∣solve of the Houses for presenting their desires by Bills to His Majesty; If the meaning be to send the Propositions that are already agreed upon by the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, & seek the Kings Majesties positive answer thereunto; and to∣gether therewith to present Bills conforme to those Propo∣sitions, for the more legall securing of this Kingdome in the Kings grant of these Propositions, although we think it more safe and convenient for both Kingdoms, that the security of both should proceed hand in hand, and simul & semel, be perfected and consummated, yet if the Honourable Houses shall insist upon the sending such Bills with the Propositions, we are so farre from giving any occasion of delay (for which we are by some unjustly blamed) that we will be ready to concurre, the Kingdom of England securing us, as they did in the large Treaty, both in relation to the King, and in relation
to themselves, as we are bound to doe the like to them. And withall we desire, that if these Bills be not ready, the sending of the Propositions be not delayed, the grant whereof by his Majesty will be an ingagement, and make way for his assent to the Bills. But if the meaning be to send Bills without sending the Propositions agreed upon by both Parliaments, or with∣out desiring the Kings Answer thereunto, then we shall be necessitated to know the pleasure of the Parliament of Scot∣land, concerning this new way before we can joyne in it, and in the meane time desire the Honourable Houses to take into their serious consideration, that the former way agreed upon by both Kingdoms is laid aside, and that this new way of sending Bills without Propositions was not thought necessary in any former addresse to his Majesty for peace. Neither was it proposed to us, or communicated to the Parliament of Scot∣land which is now adjourned, so that we cannot communicate the same unto them for the present. That it is not in the po∣wer of any Commissioner from a Parliament to forme the Propositions in Bills, or Acts of Parliament, and to desire the Kings ratification thereof, before such Bills or Acts be known and agreed upon by the Parliament it selfe; that the way of the Propositions as they are conceived by both Parliaments is a joynt way, uniting the Kingdoms in their desires, tying the King to both in his Grants, and obleiging both to see these performed and preserved, each in favour of the other, and so doth double the security, as both by way of Law, and way of Covenant, and agravates the violation of any Article, as the violation of both Law and Covenant, whereas the way of Bills without the Propositions is a more dividing way, both of the desires of the Kingdoms, of the Kings Answers thereunto, and of their Obligations to see the same performed; and therefore a disjunctive way was most earnestly pressed by the Kings Commissioners at Ʋxbridge, as most conducible to
their ends, and prediciall to ours, and for that cause was op∣posed by the Commissioners of both Kingdoms. That seeing the Parliament of Scotland is not presently sit∣ing, nd did not know of this way, and that we cannot have powr to form Acts of Parliament, this were to propose, and desire the setling the peace of the one kingdome without set∣ling of the other; which as it were contrary to the Covenant, and the Treaty, so would it be made use of by our common adversaries, to be the occasion of ruining the peace of both; and therefore we rather desire that the way already agreed upon by both Kingdoms may be observed, as that which will occasion both least delay, and lesse danger, especially seeing we are willing to crave a positive answer to the Propositions without any Treaty: And for the way of security, we desire that the way so solidly agreed upon by both Kingdoms for estblishing of the large Treaty, and inserted in the beginning and close of the Acts of Parliament of both Kingdoms in the yeare of God 1641. may be seriously considered, as contai∣ning a three-fold security, the one of ingrossing all the Pro∣positions, and passing them by way of a Law, and Act of Par∣liament; the other by way of the Kings Covenant, and Oath to his people; the third, by the Parliaments of both King∣doms; giving their full assurance, and making Publick Faith in name of both Kingdoms respectively for the true and faithfull observance thereof; all which upon the Kings grant of the Propositions may be speedily dispatched; and securely setled, which is our chiefest desire for the good of both Kingdoms. And it were earnestly to be wished in a matter of so tender a nature as the businesse of peace, wherein the mutuall advise and cnsent of both Kingdoms is necessarily required, that neither Kingdom should engage themselves without a previ∣ous debate, especially in alteration of any thing formerly a∣greed on. 14. Aug. 1645. By command of the Scottish Com∣missioners for the Parliament of Scotland. Joh. Cheisley.
UPon severall occasions we have represented to the Hou∣ses of Parliament the extream wants and necessities of the Scottish Army, and particularly of late in a paper of the sea∣venth of August, to which we have received no answer. It is fourteene moneths since a moneths pay was ordered by the House of Commons to be payed to the Scottish Army out of the Fines, and compositions for delinquents Estates, imme∣diatly after the battle of Long-marston, a great proportion whereof remaines yet due, and cannot be paid by reason seve∣rall Orders are procured from the House in prejudice thereof, for payment of monies for other uses out of those Fines and compositions. It is about seaven moneths since the House of Parliament did passe an Ordinance assessing the severall Coun∣ties towards the entertainment of that Army, of all which there is only come in to the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall a∣bout seaven or eight thousand pounds, for repayment of the moneths pay advanced by the City of London, which is all that Army received for these seaven moneths past; and for the moneths pay Ordered by the House upon the fifteenth of August, to be forthwith provided and furnished, there is no appearance of the providing thereof till the House give fur∣ther order. The Houses of Parliament were also pleased to appoint two hundred pound per diem to be payed toward the maintenance of the Infantry of that Army, which though it hath been asses∣sed by the Commissioners of Parliament, yet hath proved very in effectuall, as the Commissioners themselves have certified to the House of Commons. We doe therefore againe renew our former request to the Houses, that they would be pleased to call for the Reports of the Committee of Goldsmiths Hall concerning those Fines, and compositions, to enable them for
speedy payment of the remainder of that moneths pay Voted immediatly after the battle of Long-marston, and to order no monies to be payed by that Committee out of those Fines and compositions, till it shall be paid. That the months pay Orde∣red by the House upon the fifteenth of August to be forthwith provided and sent to the Army, may be accordingly furnished; and that a more effectuall course be taken for bringing in the monies assessed upon the severall Counties for entertainment of that Army. We are informed that the Houses of Parliament have now in consideration the sale of the delinquents Estates, and there∣fore have thought fit to put the Honourable Houses in mind of the fifth Article of the Treaty between the Kingdoms, wherein it is provided, that the Scottish Army shall be payed by the Parliament of England, out of the Estates of the Pa∣pists, Prelats, Malignants, and their adherents, or otherwise; and since it is cleerly evident, that all other waies for the maintenance of that Army have failed, we desire that a stock of credit and security may be setled by Ordinance of Parlia∣ment out of the Lands and Estates of delinquents, for pay∣ment of what is due to the Scottish Army, and that the Lands and Estates of delinquents be ingaged for no other use, till that Army receive satisfaction, which is now most necessary in regard of the great distractions of the Kingdom of Scotland; and we hope the Houses of Parliament will be the more ready to supply them, that the only quarrell the enemy doth pre∣tend against that Kingdom is, the assistance given by them to the Parliament of England. 4th. September, 1645. By Command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland. John Cheisly.
IT hath pleased the Lord our God, who worketh all things according to the counsell of his owne Will, in his wise and and righteous Providence so to dispose at this time, upon the affaires of the Kingdome of Scotland; that they are upon the sudden brought to a more deplorable condition then could in any probability have been expected, or the enemy himselfe in his pride could have presumed. We speake not of the devouring Pestilence, which in ma∣ny parts of the Land, especially in and about the chiefest City, hath raged for a long time, in many degrees above any thing that either our selves or our Predecessors have ever knowne, and hath taken away many thousands of the people, nor is it yet stayed: This (although it hath been a great ad∣vantage to the enemy, and no small discouragement and hinderance to the opposing of his power) we acknowledge to be a Plague from the more immediate hand of God, a∣gainst which there is no remedy from man, but the fervent prayers of the people of God, which we earnestly desire may be here continued, as they are piously begun, till the Lord be entreated for the Land. Our desire is to represent what the sword of the enemy hath done, after many conflicts in divers places of the North of the Kingdome, whereby great numbers have fallen, and the enemy, despicable in the beginning, had encreased in strength and boldnesse; at last, in the very bowels of the Kingdome: He hath so farre prevailed, that not onely thou∣sands of the best affected have lost their lives, and divers of them taken prisoners, but also our whole Army and Forces are put to the worst and scattered. Such as were most zealous of the Covenant and Cause of God (having no Armies on foot to joyne with, nor Garrisoned Townes for places of
refuge) are forced to fly for their lives, and to leave their ha∣bitations, possessions, and all that they have in the world to the cruelty and spoile of the enemy. Many of the common sort are drawne away by his flatteries and promises, by the Proclamations which he maketh, and the Declarations which he emitteth at his pleasure, offering to them Protections to their persons and estates, freedome and exemption from all the Taxes, Impositions, and burdnings, which they are pres∣sed with for the maintenance and supply of their Armies in England, Jreland, and at home in their owne Country; toge∣ther with the liberty of their Religion according to their Na∣tionall Covenant, and all other liberties and priviledges for∣merly established with his Majesties consent, upon condition that they will renounce their Covenant with England, and take an Oath that they shall no more lift Armes against the King and His assistants. Some of place and power, who for∣merly were either professed enemies to Religion, or never tooke Religion to heart, have dealt falsly in the Covenant, and presuming upon the successe of the enemy, and waiting for such a time as this is, have joyned with him against their Country. The most faithfull of the Ministery, by the princi∣pall enemy, and by Malignants in their owne Congregations, are driven from their stations, and forced to seeke shelter for the saving of their lives, whereby the people left behind are laid open to all sorts of tentations, and Religion it selfe is in no small danger. As we are not willing to conceale or extenu∣ate their misery, in this day of the Lords visitation, so are we not able sufficiently to expresse them; the yoake of their transgressions is bound by his hand, they are wreathed and come up upon their neck, he hath made their strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered them into their hands, from whom they are not able to rise up. In this their extreamity, the Committee of the Estates of
the Kingdom, being for the present put out of all hope of any successe from the Forces in Ireland, and knowing no o∣ther meanes of help, found it necessary, unlesse they would lose the Kingdom, and lie still under such miseries as are more intollerable then death; That the Scottish Army in Eng∣land should march Northward, to the end, that (if God in the meane time did provide no other way) they might come to their deliverance, and withall to implore the affection, counsell, and assistance of their Brethren in England; and therefore to send the Lord Chancellor for representing their distresses and desires to the Honourable Houses. Concerning the speedy march of the Scottish Army Northward for their reliefe, they supposed that Charity would move the Honourable Houses and all charitable Christians to consider, that in time of extreme trouble, na∣turall affection on both sides, in calling for and in giving of help is unresistable, and that there was no liberty left in such a case, when both the publike, and every mans private were in hazard and well neere lost, either for the Committee or for the Army, to consult or to chuse what to doe. That their Iustice would bring to their remembrance, that this Army (as is contained in the Treaty) was levied and came into England for the pursuance of the ends expressed in the Covenant, which were the safety of both Kingdomes, and their mutuall defence against the Popish, Prelaticall, and malignant party their adherents in both Kingdomes: and that they were to be employed where they were to be most usefull for the common Cause, and for opposing the Ene∣my where his power and the danger was greatest. In this notion was their marching to the North, when the King went Northward, looked upon. And now when his Forces have so farre prevailed in Scotland, their marching thither is to be interpreted to no other sense. They supposed also that
the wisdome of the Honourable Houses would make them see, that this expedition might, by the blessing of God, not only be a meane of deliverance to Scotland, but also prevent the invading of England by a new Army; which, if Scotland bee altogether subdued, may certainly be expected. The timous prevention of such an Invasion may prove no lesse serviceable for the good of the cause, and of the Kingdome of England, then the present opposition of any hostile Army within the Kingdome of England. As these necessary con∣siderations have moved the Committee of the Estates of Scotland to desire the marching of their Army Northward, so are they confident, that the Honourable Houses will rest satisfied therewith. And doe expect from them, and from all the well-affected in England, a brotherly compassion, and Christian fellow-feeling in their bitter sufferings, all ne∣cessary assistance and seasonable supply of Armes, Ammuni∣tion, and money, and in due time such Forces as may be spa∣red, as through the encrease of their troubles their need shall call for and require them. It shall not be necessary to multiply arguments to this purpose: the wisdome of the Parliament can call to remembrance the expressions in their owne Declaration of the 7 of November 1642, and in the Papers delivered in by their Commissioners in their names to the Convention of Estates in Scotland, August 12. 1643. Together with the Treaty and the solemne League and Co∣venant. It will never be forgotten by our Brethren of Eng∣land, that when our Countrey was in great quietnesse, and the greatest assurance that was possible was offered for our fu∣ture security, wee choosed, rather then to enjoy our owne peace without the peace of this Kingdome, upon the rea∣sons contained in the Declaration of the Kingdome of Scot∣land, to come with an Army into England against all dis∣couragements that might arise, either from the stormy win∣ter
season, or the power of a mighty Army in the North of this Kingdome ready to encounter us. What the endea∣vours, the actions, and the successe of that Army were, let the Enemy before that time prevalent, from his owne sense give testimony. When the Kingdome of Scotland had laid forth their strength for the recovery of Ireland, and the de∣fence of England, and promised to themselves security from forraigne invasion, especially from Ireland, upon grounds contained in the large Treaty, and in the Propositions made by Commissioners sent from both Houses, and particularly by the Ships, which according to an Article of the late Trea∣ty, were to be employed for defence of the Coast of Scotland; An Enemy neverthelesse from Ireland entred the Kingdome of Scotland, having no other controversie, nor pretending any other cause against them, but their Treaty and Covenant with England, and their assistance following thereupon, and hath prevailed so farre, as hath made this sad Remonstrance necessary at this time. It is no matter of great difficulty (unlesse wee will shut our eyes, and hide from our selves our owne danger and threatned ruine) to discerne and determine what is the great and maine designe of the Enemy, now waxed proud and insolent by the afflictions which the Lord hath brought upon the Kingdome of Scotland: When hee hath brought all there under his power, a work, which through the ma∣lignancy of some open, and many formerly secret enemies, now appearing and joyning with him, through the sufferings, calamities, and hatred brought upon the best affected, and such as have beene most active and instrumentall in this Cause, and through the discontent and distemper of the multitude for the losse of their meanes and friends in this warre at home and abroad, he presageth to be more easie and faesceable, then what he hath already brought to passe. His second expedition is against the Parliament of England,
which is not any uncertaine conjecture, but his owne pro∣fessed resolution and confidence; And is too apparent, that unlesse he be speedily suppressed, he may through the con∣course and combination of the Malignants of Scotland, and of the Northerne Counties of England, grow to a greater strength, especially if he joyne with the King and his Forces, which he is also very confident of, then be afterward easily opposed, and thereby may reduce these Kingdoms to a more miserable condition, in respect both of Religion and Liberty (beside all their intervening sufferings) then they were in before the begining of this unhappy warre. We know the cause is the same which it was at the first undertaking, that the Godly in Scotland who loved it from the beginning, and are resolved to live and die in it; that the conjunction of the two Kingdomes which the enemy labou∣reth to divide, and so to overcome, is no lesse beneficiall to both, then it was formerly conceived to be; That the Popish and prelaticall faction in forraine parts as well as His Ma∣jesties Dominions, upon the union of these Kingdomes, are more strictly and powerfully combined then they have beene at other times; That the Reformation of Religion, the common interest of all the reformed Churches in Christen∣dome, groaning so long under the crosse is as much to be looked unto as ever, and who knoweth but the Lord in his wisdome and justice is putting both their Kingdomes to a further tryall, the one by suffering the other by doing that it may be known, whether they have been seeking their owne peace and preservation, or the honour of his name, and the good of Religion. We may without giving the least cause of offence in this conjuncture of time make use of the words of the Declaration of the Convention of Estates of the King∣dome of Scotland to the subjects there, concerning their expedition into England, for the assistance of their Brethren only changing the persons, and if they were not extant in
that Declaration we would have expessed our selves in ano∣ther manner: The Lord save you from the curse of Meroz, who came not to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mighty, when we looke upon the cause which Scotland maintaineth, the Prayers, Teares and Blood which they have powred forth, and the insolencies and blasphemies of the Enemy, we cannot doubt but enlargement and deliverance shall come unto Scotland, but England hath reason to feare, if upon so faire a call they sit still, and hold their peace, they shall perish by the hand of the same enemy, and there shall be none to deliver them. We have many grounds of assu∣rance that this cloud shall passe over, and after the Lord has proved and tryed the constancy of his servants, the malig∣nancy of hipocrites, and the fellow feeling of our Brethren, his face will againe shine upon us, and his hand will raise us up and ruine our enemies; Our desire and expectation is that in the day of our rejoycing, our Brethren may rejoyce with us and be comforted in this testimony, that they did not for∣sake us in the day of trouble. Wee cannot deny that during the sitting of the Parlia∣ment, and divers times before, this Kingdome hath laid to heart the dangers of the Kingdome of Scotland, nor can it be denied that the Kingdome of Scotland hath of late given a∣bundant testimony of their affection and faithfulnesse to this Kingdome, in departing the Kingdome in such a manner, in the yeare 1641. which wee mention because of the many si∣nister suspitions and unjust calumnies vented to the contra∣ry, and by their comming againe to this Kingdome at such a time, for such ends, and against so many impediments. If any discontents, differences or jealosies have beene raised, which were nothing strange, because very ordinary and incident in time of War, a time that useth to produce ma∣ny and great difficulties, wee desire they may be all mutuall forgiven and forgotten, that the War be managed in Scot∣land,
as in England by the joynt counsells of both Kingdomes, and that in every thing a right understanding, and a strong mutuall confidence may be revived and renewed, that either Kingdome may helpe the other in time of trouble, as if they were but one Kingdome, and that the Lord may delight to blesse the endeavours of both. Sep. 1645. By command of the Committee for the Parliament of Scotland. IOHN CHEISLEY. VVHereas in answer to our paper of the date Iune 20. 1645. bearing our earnest desires of the setling of Religion and Peace in these Kingdomes, and our other papers since to the same effect, diverse votes of the Lords and Com∣mons in Parliament assembled, have beene communicated unto us, which for so long a time have not been effectuall to produce the intended, and so much desired ends. We are up∣on many and very urgent causes, constrained to renew our former desires, and are very confident, that the honourable houses judging of us in relation to the trust committed un∣to us, as if wee were their own Commissioners in the like case, And consider that our demands of establishing Truth & Peace, are not only agreeable unto, but confident with their own maine intentions, for which they have done and endu∣red so much; We shall not onely be free of the censure of importunity; but shall have their approbation, with such an answer as may give us satisfaction, and put our minds to rest hereafter. And first concerning Religion, we blesse God and thank∣fully acknowledge the zeale and endeavours of the Parlia∣ment, for what is already done in the matter of the Directo∣ry for the publike worship of God; But cannot wonder e∣nough what should be the cause that the government of the Church, which is the wall of Ierusalem, and the hedge for preserving of other parts of Religion, is so long expected by all the Reformed Churches, especially by the Church of
Scotland, so earnestly desired by the Assembly, by the godly of the Ministry and people both in City and Countrey, is op∣posed by the enemy as the finall determination of the con∣troversies of Religion, and the ruine of all their presumpti∣on and expectation ever to recover themselves, and would so much conduce for Order and Peace both in Church and State; should stay so long in the birth, and not be brought forth and established. We cannot conceive the want of the love of Religion which is so acceptable to God, that without it nothing can be accepted, and so profitable both to the publick and to e∣very mans private, that it is the one thing that is necessary, to be the cause; when wee remember that the honourable Houses by their Commissioners, and in their Declarations to the Kirk and Kingdome of Scotland, and the reverend Assem∣bly of Divines in their letters by their direction, have so fully and frequently professed, That Religion was the controversie betwixt them and the contrary party, And the chief ground of craving aid and assistance from the Kingdome of Scotland, And of the solemne League and Covenant, now known to all the World, the prime Articles whereof, are for the Refor∣mation of Religion as well in discipline and government, as in doctrine and worship, and for unity and uniformity in all these, in the three kingdomes. Like as upon the other part, it was the principall cause that moved the Kingdome of Scotland, to deny themselves, to forsake their own peace and ease, and to joyne with their Brethren in the time of their distresse, for prosecuting this war, wherein they have spent so much bloud in this Kingdome and at home, lost so many worthy and pretious men and endured so many miseries; In all which and against death it selfe, their chiefest comfort hath been the testimony of their consciences, that they were contending, suffering, and dying for Religion, And for the Cause and Covenant of God, which is also the consolation
of their Widdowes, Orphanes and Friends, whom they have left behind them. Nor do we apprehend how the judgement or obstruction doth come from any other party: Such as have wilfully re∣fused to joyn themselves in Covenant, or do deale falsely in the Covenant, are not to be regarded, but are to be reckoned amongst the enemies, And what ever their professions or pre∣tences be, are not indeed serving the Lord Jesus Christ, or the publick, but seeking themselves and their own ends, And such as have taken the Covenant, and make conscience of the Oath of God, will not sleight Reformation, Vniformity, or the extirpation of superstition, heresy, schisme, and pro∣fannesse, far lesse appeare against the setling of the govern∣ment of the Church, But will with all their strength endea∣vour it, as the meane appointed of God for so necessary ends; No man can be so destitute of sense and reason, as to thinke such an Anarchy and confusion as now prevaileth in the Churches of this Kingdome, to be the Ordinance of God; No Christian can be so void of knowledge and faith, as to imagine such a monstrous deformity, to be the beauty and glory of the Kingdome of Christ on earth; No brother can beare a mind so contrary to charity, as to judge such an in∣tolerable condition, to be the reward of so much bloud as hath beene shed in this cause, And of the so many and gree∣vious sufferings of all the three Kingdomes; Nay wee are perswaded that God hath provided better things for us, that necessity will bring all that tender the preservation of Religi∣on, and the peace of the Church, to joyn at last in the right order, and government of the Church, and that both Houses (which is all our desire, concerning this) will adde from that authority, wherewith God hath vested them, their civill Sanction, to what the pious and learned Assembly after long and serious debates, have advised as most agreeable to the Word of God.
There be alwaies some Incendiaries and evill instru∣ments who will be raising jealousies against Church-government, as a collaterall power erecting it selfe at the side of the Civill, and in the nd overtopping it, which is nothing else but to raise jealousies against the spirituall Kingdome of Christ, as if it were inconsistent with the Kingdome of this World. In other places where Civill powers are no lesse tender to their greatnesse and superio∣rity, there is no such thing. Upon the contrary, the Civill powers finde their honour and authoritie increased, the people under them more dutifull and obedient, and their places more comfortable both in peace and war, by the Discipline of the Church in Presbyteries and Synods. Mi∣nisters in their persons and professions are subject to Civill authority, and though they receive the rules and directi∣ons of their Ministerie from Christ, yet may the Civill power command and compell them to doe their duty in preaching, administring the Sacraments, and exercising of Discipline, and may hold them to such principles as are well knowne by the confessions of the Reformed Churches, and their long peaceable practice agreeable thereunto: And therefore no danger is to be feared from their power, but much helpe and happinesse from their faithfulnesse, if they finde encouragement from the Civill power, which they will greatly need against so many diffi∣culties as they have to wrestle with before this Church be setled in purity and peace. It is no mervaile that wicked men the sonnes of Belial are unwilling to submit their necks to this yoke that Christ may raigne over them; this is their corruption and will prove their misery. But it is the excellencie and praise of Church-government, that it is terrible to such as an Army with banners. Nor should it seem strange that some of the
godly, who have been sore pressed with Prelaticall tyranny and usurpation, should be afraid of all Ecclesiasticall go∣vernment. But this will appeare to be needlesse feare, when they cast their eyes upon the sweet and peaceable govern∣ment of all the reformed Churches for so many yeeres; and when they consider that the power of the Keyes is not to be exercised at the pleasure of any one in a Monarchi∣call way, but by a Company and Colledge of Ministers and Elders, chosen with the consent of the people: Or that others of the godly measuring the constitution of Presby∣teries and Assemblies by the corruption and prophanenesse of many Presbyters in the Prelaticall times, should con∣ceive of them as formidable to the power of godlinesse; But when they shall perceive that by the wisdome and care of the Parliament, the Presbyters and Assemblies are constituted and made up of orthodox, pious, and select persons, zealous of the honour of Jesus Christ, and of the edification of soules, this feare will vanish. Nor can there be any other remedy of so many feares and jelousies, but the setting up of the government it selfe, which by the power of God accompanying his owne Ordinance, will prove a comfort to the godly, a meanes to winne many to Christ, and a matter of rejoycing to all who have been in∣struments of so good a worke, especially to the honou∣rable houses of Parliament, whom we therefore earnest∣ly desire, against all obloquies and impediments, by their authority to establish it, that it may in reality speake for it selfe above any verball expressions of ours; and when we see Religion so far promoted, we may the more cheer∣fully proceed in the common cause, as knowing that wee have not been beating the ayre. Our other renewed desire is concerning peace, which of all things, next to truth, is most desireable; for attaining
whereof, we conceive two things to be necessary: One is, that seeing by Gods good providence, the Scottish Army is not yet necessitated to goe for Scotland, but may remain in this Kingdome, a solid course may be taken, according to the Treaty for their necessary maintenance, that they be encouraged to act their part, and be kept from such o∣ther waies, as have been, and must be uncomfortable to themselves, and hurtfull to their brethren here, where∣upon much discontent ariseth on both sides, and by joynt counsels may be directed and set in such a way for prose∣cuting of the warre, as may be most effectuall and benefi∣ciall for this, and consequently of both Kingdomes. The other thing which wee conceive to be necessary is, that Propositions of peace be speedily dispatcht to His Majesty. This wee have pressed divers times before, and have waited for the results of the consideration of the bu∣sinesse by the house of Commons, conforme to their Order of the 18 of August, but till this time wee have not heard what progresse they have made. Our opportunity herein is not greater then our Commission is urgent, and our Commandements frequent, to take all occasions for speed∣ing the setlement of truth and peace, the ends which have engaged us to this warre. Of late when our Kingdome in the wonderfull providence of God was brought low, wee were altogether silent, lest our desire should have appea∣red to proceed rather from impatience under the sence of our sufferings, then from our sincerity and zeale of the publique peace; But now when the mighty hand of God hath wrought a notable deliverance for Scotland, and hath blessed the Armies of this Kingdome with marvellous suc∣cesse, by which meanes the King having no considerable strength to relie upon in Scotland or England, may be humbled, and his heart prepared for hearkening to peace,
wee conceive the motion to be more seasonable, and doe hope it will be more successefull then ever before, and what the Lord will doe hereafter when opportunities have not been taken hold of, wee doe not know, nor is it for us to conjecture: but so much wee may in certainty foresee, that if the King shall grant such Propositions as may be the foundation of a safe and firme peace, wee have that which ought to be the common desire of all the three Kingdomes in the most easie way. And if (which God for∣bid) his heart shall be still averse, our advantage is great, having besides the approbation of God, and the eternall peace of our owne soules, the testimony of the world and the conviction of our enemies, together with the stronger resolution, when we are at out wits end to follow the war, and thereby within a short time (through the blessing of God) to obtaine our peace. Concerning the Kingdome of Scotland, the reports of others, and their owne speculations of the miseries of war in forraine parts, are felt of them, and verified of late in their lamentable experience; as the want of ordinary Courts, and courses of justice; the decay of commerce and trade by Sea and Land, to the impoverishing of the Kingdome, and making of thousands of families to beg, who hardly can finde supply from the richer sort, because their revenues are not payd them; the plunder and deva∣station of the Souldiers; the assesments, pressures, and un∣necessary burdens laid upon the Subjects for intertaining the warre, above that which they are able to beare; the great effusion of blood, and the cutting off of many of the best affected, with other sufferings of women and children, which are grievous to remember. And when by the ca∣lamities of a long lasting warre, they are brought low and exhausted of men and meanes, the danger of drawing in
the barbarous Irish, or some other forraine enemy to their utter undoing: The difficulties and distresses of this King∣dome through the long continuance of this unnaturall warre, are better knowne to the wisdome of the honou∣rable Houses, then to us: Yet after so long residence upon publique imployments in this place, we cannot be so voyd of the knowledge and sense of them, as not to apprehend the danger of the like extremity at last, unto our brethren of England. Seeing therefore the Fields are now white to the Har∣vest both of perfecting the Reformation of Religion, and of making a sure and well-grounded Peace, and there be so strong inclinations and desires, so many invitations and encouragements, so fit preparations, and sutable disposi∣tions on all hands for so blessed a worke, wee doe in all earnestnesse desire, that the opportunity which can hardly be redeemed when once lost, may be improved to the greatest advantage by the wisdome and zeale of the ho∣nourable Houses, and doe expect their speedy answer, that wee may be able to render an account to the Parliament of Scotland, or to those that sent us, and waite for it at our hands. By command of the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland, JOHN CHEISLEY. September, 1645. UPon the 26. of this instant your Lordships did com∣municate to us the resolutions of both Houses, to which you desired a speedy answer, and further acquain∣ted us, that the Papers by us lately given in were under consideration of the house, and that wee shall receive their answer with all conveniency; and upon the 27 your Lord∣ships renewed the same desires. Wee cannot give a positive answer to the desire of both
Houses concerning the disposall of the Army because it is not in our power, but we shall communicate their desires forthwith to the Committee with the Army, and presse them with all the earnestnesse we can, to which we expect they will be ready to give all just satisfaction, so farre as the season of the yeere may admit; and in the meane time wee desire a speedy answer to our Paper of the fourth of this instant, and the other of the twelfth, so farre as con∣cernes Money, Armes, and Ammunition, which is still as necessary for accomplishment of our desires, as if the Army had marched into Scotland, and the speedie proceeding thereof will be a great encouragement to that Army, and furtherance to their undertakings. It is well enough knowne to the honourable Houses, how farre that Armie hath been disappointed of provi∣sions formerly, (having, for instance, received but one moneths pay these seven moneths past) how much their proceedings have been retarded this Summer, and some of their undertakings frustrate for want of necessary ac∣commodation. And we desire it may be considered, what hinderance it may be to the publique service, if for the fu∣ture effectuall course shall not be taken for their entertain∣ment, and other necessaries. It is agreed upon by the Treaty that 31000 li. should be monethly allowed, and payed towards the maintenance of that Armie, for reall performance whereof, many De∣clarations have been made by the honourable Houses of Parliament, before and since the entrie of that Army into this Kingdome; and finding the monies arising out of the Assessments and Revenues of the Northerne Counties, were not sufficient for maintenance thereof, did in February last passe an Ordinance of Parliament for assessing 21000 pound monethly upon the severall Counties therein men∣tioned: of all which (there being now full seven moneths
past) there is onely come in to the Committee of Gold∣smiths-hall about 12000 li. which together with 19000 li. yet to be brought in they are obliged to repay to the Citie of London, for the moneths pay by them advanced; so that there is no probability that any considerable propor∣tion can for a long time be brought in to supply the neces∣sities of that Army, especially there being two other as∣sessments which precede the assessments of the Scottish Army, (although the Treaty between the Kingdoms doth precede them all, and ought to be observed as soone as any particular Ordinance,) and these assessments for other Armies are really executed, and moneys thereupon col∣lected by the Counties and brought in: whereas the asses∣ment for the Scottish Armie is almost wholly neglected, is not executed by others, and cannot be executed by us, our very demanding the question being clamored against, as intermedling with their estates; Neither is it our desire in the least kind to intermeddle, providing that it were remembred that not a written Ordinance, but reall pay∣ment can satisfie the necessities of the Souldiers. By the same Ordinance 20 February, 1644. the Com∣missioners of Excise appointed by Ordinance of Parlia∣ment, or their respective Deputies and Commissioners are ordained to pay 3000 li. monethly out of the whole Ex∣cise arising out of the six Northerne Counties. And though the Excize is accounted, and doth really prove to all o∣thers, to be one of the best securities within the Kingdome, yet all waies are taken to make it ineffectuall to that army, so that there hath not been one hundred pound thereof received in all, for these five moneths past, the profits thereof being almost wholly anticipated and fore-stalled here in the South, and applied to other uses, and in all appearance shall still continue in that condition, unlesse the honourable Houses give further order herein to the
Commissioners of Excize for paiment of that 3000 li. to the Scots Armie, according to the intent of the Ordi∣nance. Concerning the Coale of Newcastle, the price thereof hath been so much diminished, and the trade thereby de∣creased, that this last moneth the profits thereof have not amounted to above eight hundred pounds, whereas they were estimated by your Lordships in a Paper of November 1644. to seven thousand pound per mensem, for and to∣wards the paiment of the 31000 li. monethly due to the Scottish Armie. There was also 200 li. per diem lately appointed to be paid to the Infantrie of that Armie, whereof they never received one penny to this houre, as was certified to the house of Commons by their Commissioners, in their Let∣ters of August 31. The obstructions and failings in the waies appointed by the Houses for the entertainment of that Armie, with di∣vers others, we have represented in our former Papers, to which wee have never received any answer, nor seen any effectuall course taken for redresse thereof. And if the Houses shall be pleased to remove these obstructions, sup∣ply the defects, and take an effectuall course for their en∣tertainment, the Scottish Armie will be very farre from giving the least occasion to the Parliament to make any Declaration more concerning them, nor other Armies within the Kingdome against laying of Taxes or raising of any contribution upon any Countie or part of the King∣dome, or giving any cause of complaint to the Countrie. And we are perswaded it is the earnest desire of that armie to evidence according to the ninth Article of the Treatie, that their enterance into, and continuance in England, shall be made use of to no other ends then are expressed in the Covenant and Treatie. But if no effectuall course shall
be taken for their entertainment, according to the Treaty, and that it shall not be thought lawfull for them to provide for their necessary subsistence in the parts where they shall re∣side, we leave it to the Houses of Parliament to judge whe∣ther it must not inevitably follow that they shall either starve or disband, which we are confident is as farre from the inten∣tion of the Honourable Houses, as it is against the Law of Na∣ture, the cause wherein, and the Covenant and Treaty where∣by, that Army was ingaged. These things out the conscience of our duty and sense of the trust put upon us, we could not forbeare to expresse for our owne exoneration; nor doe we represent them to expo∣stulate for the time past; but that a speedy and effectuall re∣medy may be taken by the Honourable Houses for the fu∣ture, whereby that Army may be enabled and rendred more active in advancing the publike service. 29. Sept. 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Kingdome of Scotland. John Cheisley. TO give a more positive answer to the desires of the Houses concerning the marching of the Scottish Army to besiege Newarke was not in our power, nor within the bounds of our Commission: But what was in our power for satisfying the desires of the Houses, that we have done with all diligence; for we did forthwith communicate the desires of the Houses to the Committee of the Parliament of Scot∣land residing with the Army, and intrusted for their part with the power of disposing of the Army, and with all ear∣nestnesse
did presse a speedy and satisfactory answer, which we doe shortly expect; because by Letters which we have re∣ceived by this Post, we understand there is a meeting of that Committee, and of some of the generall Officers of that Army upon the borders with the Committee of Scotland, and we are very hopefull the result of their consultations shall tend to the bettering the condition of that Army, the advancing of the publike service, and the satisfying the de∣sires of both Houses of Parliament. As it shall be our earnest desire and constant endeavours, That the Scottish Army may be active in the prosecuting the Warre untill the peace of both Kingdoms be setled, so we cannot but renue our desires to the Honourable Houses to take more to heart the necessities of that Army, the removall of the obstructions, and supply of the defects of the wayes ap∣pointed for their maintenance; and we earnestly entreat for a speedy answer to the particulars represented by us in our former Papers concerning the Army, and for setling of Reli∣gion, and procuring the common Peace of both Kingdoms, which were the maine causes and ends that engaged us in this Warre. It may be equally considered by the Honourable Houses, when now the Kingdome of Scotland, out of the earnest de∣sire upon the grounds contained in the Covenant and Treaty to procure the peace of this Kingdome, have denied them∣selves and lost their owne peace, and are obliged by Cove∣nant, Treaty, and joynt Declaration of both Kingdoms, ne∣ver to lay downe Armes till the peace be setled. To what straits the Kingdome of Scotland is brought, if the Houses of Parliament, being earnestly and frequently desired by that Kingdome, shall delay to joyne in seeking a safe and well-grounded Peace upon termes already agreed upon by the joint consent of both Kingdoms, and in the meane time shall
not provide a sure way of entertainment for the Scotch Ar∣my, and thereby enable them, according to the Treaty, to prosecute the Warre. When this is laid to heart by the wis∣dome and brotherly affection of the Houses of Parliament, we doe not doubt but in their justice and equity they will judge of our difficulties and desires as if they were their own, and will determine and doe as in the like case they would expect from the Kingdom of Scotland. 9. October 1645. By command of the Commissioners for the Parliament of Scotland. John Cheisley. FINIS.
