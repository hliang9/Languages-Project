THE Amorous Conquests Of the Great Alcander, OR, THE AMOURS Of the French KING, And Madam Montespan. LONDON, Printed for R. Bentley, and S. gnes, in Russel-street, in Co∣vent-Garden, 1685.
THE PREFACE. ALthough these Me∣moirs seem to have very much of the Air of a Romance, yet there are very few that are more true. I Originally know the grea∣ter part of the Affairs, which I relate, and the rest comes from so good Hands, that I should be too blame to doubt the Truth of them. However
if some certain Circum∣stances, which ought to have been very secret, make it be believed, that I have added a great deal of my own, as those often do, that take upon them to Write, I desire the Reader to sus∣pend his Judgment, until he can enquire after them from some body, who shall not be suspected by him. For example, if that which I relate of the Lyings in of Madam de Montes∣pan, is any way surpri∣sing,
since there were in the Chamber only the Grand Alcander, and two other Women, I pray him to con∣sider, that one of those o Women, may have told e of them, and that I ould not mention them as do, if I did not very well ow, what it was I say.  I am accused of indis∣cretion, for Revealing that hich hath been told me, will answer to that, that am not at all engaged keep the Secret, nei∣ther
was it required at Hands, that I should k it. As for the other Ma¦ters, there are few M who have been abroad the World, that have  had some knowledge of the and if I have had a mo particular notice, it m be believed, that it is, be¦cause I probably may ha been my self engaged in t Intrigue.
THE Amorous Conquests Of the Great Alcander, With the NTRIGUES OF HIS COURT. THE Affairs of the Great Alcander▪ who was become the Terrour of all his E∣s, band the Wonder of all , did not hinder him some∣times
from making Love. A whereas it was impossible for  to make their Fortune, at le without having the Honour of  good Graces, the Ladies as w as the Cavaliers, made it their  siness to please him, and those w succeeded best therein, thou the better of themselves, althou at bottom all People of Hon did the less esteem them. Madam de Montespan was  of those, and though she mi pass for one of the fairest C¦tures in the World, yet there  something more agreeable in Wit, than in her Countenan but all these fine Qualities  obscured by the faults of her S which was accustomed to the  notorious Deceits, so That  cost her nothing: She was one of the most Antient fa¦lies of the Realm, and her ¦ance, as well as Beauty had been  Cause, that Monsieur de Montes
ad Courted her in Marriage, and had referred her before several others, who would have better fitted his ccasions. Madam de Montespan, who de∣sired to be Married, only that she night take the more liberty, no ooner came to Court, but she had great designes upon the Grand Alcander's Heart; but whereas it was at that time taken up, and that Madam de la Valliere, a Person of a mean Beauty, but who had in re∣compence a thousand other good Qualities, wholely possest it; she made many unprofitable advances, nd was obliged at last to seek a Party elsewhere. She then despising every thing, that was not near the Crown, cast her Eyes upon the Heart of Monsieur, Brother to the Grand Alcander, who shew'd her a ood Will, rather to make it be be∣ived, that he was capable of be∣ng Amorous of Ladies, than be∣cause he resented any thing for
her, like love. Monsieur surpriz thereby a great number of Peop who did not think that he was sen¦sible in regard of the fair Sex; b the Chevalier de Lorrain, jealous  this new Correspondence, soon ma this young Prince return to his fo¦mer inclinations, and having  Ascendent over him, Madam  Montespan enjoyed only some ap¦pearances, whilest he alone stoo possest of his whole Favour. Madam de Montespan, who veed a place in Monsieur's Hea only because she had failed to g the Kings, was yet more disgust when she saw that she was to sh it with the Chevalier de Lorrain and not being able to comprehen why so fine a Woman as she w should be slighted for the sake that Chevalier, who had nothi recommendable besides his Bi she resolved to scorn him,  slighted her, and mightily reproed Monsieur, who comforted hi
lf with the Chevalier de Lor∣rain. In the mean time Madam de Montespan's Beauty was the object f the whole Court's desiers, and articularly of Monsieur de Lau∣'s, the Great Alcanders Favou∣te, a Man of no advantageous tature, and of a very mean Meen ut who made up these two Faults, with two great Qualities. That is o say, with much Wit, and a—ertain I know not what, which ccasioned, that when a Lady once new him, she did not easiy quit him for another. Besides his Fa∣vour with the King, rendred him ecommendable, so that Madam de Montespan, who had heard these  Qualities discoursed of, and desired to know by Experience, whether they did not attribute to im, more than he effectually had, d not disdain the proffers of ser∣vice that he made her. However here being a great deal of cun∣ning
mixt with her Curiosity,  made him languish five or six Week before she would grant him th least Favour, and while she mad him wait for it, there hapned t this Favourite, a business that migh have ruined him with his Master if he had not been born more hap¦py than wise. The Great Alcander, as muc advanced as he was above all o¦thers, was not of any other hu¦mour, or temper, than Ordinary Men; although he passionately lo¦ved Madam de la Valliere, yet h sometimes felt himself smitten wit some other Ladies Beauty; and wa glad to satisfie his desire. He ha then such Sentiments as these fo the Princess of Monaco, whose Fa¦vour Monsieur de Lausun was pos¦sest of, and Monsieur de Lausun, be¦cause he did believe himself capa¦ble, by reason of his great Quali¦ties, which I have before menti¦oned, to preserve the Princess o
aco's Amity, and to gain Ma∣m de Montespan's Heart, did for∣d the Princess, who had disco∣red to him Alcanders Passion, to vour it at all, and threatned her, at if he perceived she did, he ould ruin her Reputation in the orld. These threatnings, instead of plea∣ng the Princess of Monaco, made er think of casting off the Tyran∣y, which he would exercise over er, and at the same time taking ch measures with the Great Al∣cander, as she never did before▪ e made him resolve to send Mon∣eur de Lausun to the Wars, where e had a considerable Command. Having told Monsieur de Lausun, hat he should prepare himself to depart within two or three days, Monsieur de Lausun remained alto∣gether surprized at these so unex∣pected News, and immediately guessing at the cause, he told Al∣cander the Great, that he would
not go to the Army, at least ¦less he would give him the Co¦mand of it; however, that he s well enough, why he sent him t ther; that it was to enjoy his  stress the more peaceably, duri his absence; but that it should n be said, that they had so grofly d¦ceived him, at least without  shewing, that he was sensible their deceit; that this was the A¦ction rather of a perfidious Ma than of a great Prince, such as  had always esteemed him, and th he was glad it had served to dis buse him. Although the Great Alcande had been always accustomed t speak like a Master, and that n Man had until that time dared t make him any reproaches; yet h failed not to give Monsieur de La¦sun a hearing untill the end; bu seeing that his folly still encrease more and more, he coldly asked him if he was mad, and if he well re¦membred
that he spoke to his Ma∣er, and to him, who could cast him wn, in as little time as he had ised him. Monsieur de Lausun nswered him, That he knew that as well as he; that he very well knew, hat it was to him alone he was in∣debted for his Fortune, having ne∣ver made his Court to any Minister, ike the other Great men of the Realm; but all that should not hinder him to tell the Truth, and continu∣ing in the same tone that he had begun, he was yet about to say se∣veral ridiculous and extravagant things, when Alcander prevented him, by telling him, that he gave him only four and twenty hours o resolve upon his departing; and that if he did not obey him, he ould consider what he had to do. Having left him after these few words, Monsieur de Lausun began o be in an unconceivable despaire, and attributing all this accident
to the Correspondence, which the Princess of Monaco began to hav with Alcander the Great, he wen to her Lodgings, where not find¦ing her, he broke a large Look¦ing Glass, as though he had re¦venged himself sufficiently by that The Princess of Monaco complain¦ed of him to Alcander, who re¦plyed, That he was a Fool, on whom she was likely to have revenge e¦nough by his absence, that he him¦self had suffered surprizing things but that he pardoned him all considering that he might well be in despaire, for losing a Ladies Fa¦vour, whose merit was so great as hers. When the four and twenty hour were expired, he demanded of Mon¦sieur de Lausun, what he was re¦solved to do, who answering, th he was resolved not to depart, un¦less he gave him the Command of the Army, the Great Alcander was moved with anger against him
d again threatned to reduce him to such a condition, as he should ave cause to repent of having rovoked him so far; but Monsieur e Lausun, not becoming more di∣reet for all these Menaces, repli∣d, That all the mischief he could o him, was to take from him the office of General of the Dragoons, hich he had given him, and that e having fore seen that, had brought his Commission with him in his Po∣cket, and at the same time taking it out, he threw it upon a Table, neer which the King was seated, which did so exasperate the Great Alcan∣der, that he sent him that very hour to the Bastile. This did very much amaze all the World, no Man yet know∣ing what could have drawn the disgrace upon this Favourite. Madam de Montespan, having heard of his Misfortune, was over∣joyed at the delay she had used in her Intrigue, and was with no great difficulty comforted, believing, that
after his indiscretion, which beg to be the publick discourse of t World, there was no more retu¦ing for him into Alcanders favour However his disgrace did not con¦tinue so long as was imagined;  the Great Alcandex, having  found in the Princess of Mona Charmes powerful enough to re him, had no sooner satisfied his Fan¦cy, but he pardoned Monsieur  Lausun, who returned to Court with more Credit than ever: Yet every¦body was sufficiently astonished  it, because it was not thought, th Alcander was of an humour eve to forget that want of respect, which Monsieur de Lausun did shew him. Monsieur de Lausun's returne to Court, having made all the World conceive, that he must needs have a great Ascendent over Alcanders Spirit, all men were very industri¦ous to give him some markes o their inclination to his Service, and among others, Madam de Montes∣pan,
who no longer could deny m the last Favours. This new trigue, that ought to have com∣rted Monsieur de Lausun for the incess of Monaco's Infidelity, did ot hinder him from meditating  some revenge, whereof he in a ew days after found an opportu∣ity. This Lady with many o∣hers was sitting upon a green turfe, nd laying her Hand upon the rass, he trod upon it as it were nwittingly, and having made a ind of turne on purpose to wring t the harder, he addressed himself o her to demand Pardon. The pain, which the Princess of Monaco felt, made her squeak out, but she was less sensible of that, than of a mocking Laughter, which Monsieur de Lausun affected in ex∣cusing himself, she gave him a thou∣sand injurious Terms, and made all those who were present compre∣hend, that she could not be so pas∣sionate against him, without ha∣ving
some other reason for it. Mon¦sieur de Lausun, who was concern to preserve his Reputation amon the Ladies, suffered the Princess  Monaco's resentment to evapora in reproaches, without desiring  answer them otherwise, than  submissions and excuses. And t Ladies who were present, havin taken upon themselves to recon¦cile them, she was obliged to b quiet; for fear of discovering  them, that her vexation proceede from another cause. The Princess of Monaco havin thus lost her Lover, and having b tasted, if I may so say, of the Gre Alcander, sought to comfort h self for it, by the Conquest of som other, but her Temper being n severe, nor her Appetite content with one Man alone, she tryed  many Chances, that at length sh fell under them. She having like a Page who was a proper handsom Fellow, but one that run over a
ris, after the manner of Pages, e had a mind to know, whether she ould find him a better Man, than ose Persons of Quality, of whom ly she had until that time made yal: But he having a Distemper pon him, infected the Princess of Monaco with it, who did not put er self under Cure for it, as soon  she ought, perhaps because she id not at first know what it was,  else out of shame and trouble to iscover it. Therefore when she en∣ed into a course of Physick, she ied under it, giving by her Death trange apprehensions to those, who ad imitated her in her Pleasures. The Princess of Monaco's Rela∣tions did very carefully conceal the nature of her Distemper; but Mon∣eur, the Great Alcanders Brother, who had had some familiarity with her, tho' of no long continuance, and who in recompence of some Services rendred him, and the Che∣valier de Lorraine, had given her
the charge of Houskeeper to  Wife, was afraid of being in¦ved in her Misfortune, and c not be at rest, until he had ass¦bled four Persons, who were  most skilful in that kind of ¦stemper, to know whether he  not in danger of it; they ass him, that he was not, which  wholy restore him to his Spirits,  made him soon forget the Prince of Monaco. The Great Alcander suspected th Intrigue of Madam de Montesp and of Monsieur de Lausun, a whereas Love enters by seve ways into the Hearts of Men, th reflection which he made upon h Favorites good Fortune, made hi consider more narrowly, than b had done till that time, the Me and Beauty of Madam de Montes¦pan. Besides, the Possession of Ma¦dam de la Valliere, began to breed in him some distaste, the insepara¦ble mischief of long enjoyment
w whereas Madam de Montes∣ had a very particular atten∣n upon Alcanders Person, she n perceived by his Words and tions, that he was not unsensi∣ of her Charmes, and whereas  knew, that presence was the st necessary thing in the World,  foment Amorous Sentiments,  endeavoured all she could to e∣blish her self at Court, which e belieued might be easily done, she once entred into a confidence th Madam de la Valliere, who for r part sought to discharge her f upon some good Friend, of the spleasure, which she conceived  the lukewarmness of the Great lcander's Flames. Madam de Val∣re did very well approve of the dvances which Madam de Mon∣span made her, and there imme∣ately was a kind of friendship knit etween these two Ladies, or at  least some appearance of a friend∣ip; for I very well know, that
Madam de Montespan, who had h end, was far from loving Madam de la Valliere, who was the only obstacle of her designes. The Gre Alcander who did already rese some tenderness for the other, w overjoyed to see her every d with Madam de la Valliere, who Madam de Montespan did likewise Charm, because she industrious embraced all her Interests, and h an admirable Complaisance for he blaming the Great Alcander for h indifference, and furnishing her wi means to make him return. In the mean time, the Great Al¦cander went oftner to Madam de  Valliere's Lodgings than he w accustomed to do, that he migh have the pleasure of seeing Ma¦dam de Montespan, and Madam de la Valliere applying to her s these new Assiduities, loved Madam de Montespan the better, believin that it was by her Cares she en¦joyed his sight the oftener. B
last, she having once had a part the true Affections of his Heart, n perceived that every thing ich the Great Alcander did then unto her, was counterfeit, and  Passion for him serving her in▪ ad of Wit, whereof she had no eat share by Nature, she appre∣hended, that Madam de Montespan ceived her, and that Alcander s more intimate with her than  had hitherto imagined. As soon as this suspicion had seiz∣ her mind, she observed them narrowly, that she no longer ubted that they deceived her, d her Passion not permitting her keep the secret any longer, she derly complained of it to Great Alcander, who told her, that he as too generous to abuse her any rther, that it was true, he did ve Madam de Montespan, but yet at it should not hinder him from ving her, as he ought, that she must be contented with what he
should do for her, without de¦ing more, because he did not lo to be constrained. This answer more like a Mi¦sters than a Lovers, was far from satisfying so nice a Mistress, as Ma¦dam de la Valliere, she wept,  lamented, but all that did not ¦ten the Great Alcander; he once a¦gain told her, that if she desired continuance of his Love, she should exact nothing from him beyond  will; he prayed her to live wi Madam de Montespan, as she h done before, and assured her, th if she shew'd the least unkindness that Lady, she would oblige hi to take other measures. The Great Alcanders Will was Law to Madam de la Valliere: S lived with Madam de Montespan in an Union, that could not  reasonably expected from a Riv and she surprized all the World by her Conduct; because all the World began to be persuaded th
Great Alcander did by little d little forsake her, and gave himself up entirely to Madam de Montespan. In the mean time, the Great Al∣cander being a nice Lover, and not le to endure that a Husband should share with him in the Fa∣urs of Madam de Montespan, he solved to remove him out of the ay, upon pretence of giving him me great Employments, but Mon∣sieur de Montespan was of no Com∣alsant humour, he refused all that they offered him, doubting indeed, at his Wives Merit did contri∣bute more to his advancement, an any thing he could have re∣commendable in himself. Madam de Montespan, who had taken delight in the Kings Em∣aces, could no longer endure those  her Husbands, neither would e grant him any more; which  Monsieur de Montespan into such despaire, that although he ten∣derly
loved her, he did not ref from giving her a good box the Ear. Madam de Montespan who well knew where to find support, gave him extream Language, and having complai of his proceeding to the Great cander; he banished Monsieur Montespan the Court, who w his Children departed into his o Country, bordering upon the reneans: There went into  Mourning, as if he had lost Wife indeed. And he being m indebted, the Great Alcander s him two hundred thousand Liv to comfort him for the loss whi he had been the occasion of. However, some time after Mon¦sieur de Montespan's departure, Ma¦dam de Montespan became wi Child, and although she might w imagine that all the World kn what past between the Great Al¦cander and her self; yet she being ashamed to be seen in that con¦tion,
invented a new Mode, which was very advantageous for Wo∣en who would hide their great ellies; it was a short Wastcoat ke a Mans, reaching only to the aste, where pulling out some part of the Shift, they made it sit in as rge Puffs as they could upon the etticoat, and so hid the Belly. All this did not hinder the Great Alcander's Court, from perceiving learly how matters went; but whereas the Courtiers did almost dore that Prince, their incense reached even his Mistress, whose avour every one began to Court; and she having an infinite deal of it, made as many Friends as she ould, which Madam de la Valli∣ere had never done, who to shew the Great Alcander, that it was himself only that she loved, never would ask any thing for another. Therefore her Rivals Credit was o sooner perceived, but every one with pleasure left her, whereof one
day complaining the Mareschall Grammont made her answer,  she should have taken care to hi made others Rejoyce with her, w she her self had cause to Rejoyce if when she should have cause Mourn, she desired that other should Mourn also. Madam de Valliere seeing  self thus abandoned by all the World, resolved to go into a Con¦vent, and having chose that of  Carmelites, she retired thither, a in a little time after took the  bit, where she lives, as 'tis said great Sanctity; which I easily be¦lieve, for that having tryed, as had done, the inconstancy of world Affairs, she plainly saw, that it  in God alone, in whom she  to trust. Her retreat did equally sati the Great Alcander, and Madam de Montespan, the last, because was in a continual apprehen est Madam de la Valliere i
again return into the Great Al∣canders Favour, whose most ten∣r Affections she had once pos∣sessed; and the other, because her presence still upbraided him of  Inconstancy. In the mean while, the time of Madam de Mon∣tespan's lying in approaching, the great Alcander retired to Paris, whither he went but seldom, ho∣g that she might be more se∣cretly brought to bed there, than St. Germains, where he usually ded. The time being come, a Woman Madam de Montespan's Bed∣chamber, in whom the Great Al∣cander and her self had a particu∣lar confidence, took Coach, and  into St. Anthonies Street to Monsieur Clements, the Renowned  Midwife, whom she asked if would go along with her, to er a Lady, who was in La∣ but at the same time she him, that if he would go, he
must be Hood-wink't, because  was desired, that he should  know, whither he went.  Clement, to whom the like a dents had often arrived, see that she, who came to fetch h had a gentle Aire, and that  Adventure presaged nothing,  what was good, he told the W man, that he was ready to do  that she desired, and suffring hi¦self to be mufled, he took Co along with her, out of which, ter several turns about the To he alighted, and was led into very stately Appartment, wh his mufler was taken off. However he had no time gi him to consider the place where  was, and he had no sooner re¦vered his sight, but a Girl, w was in the Chamber, put out  Lights; after which, the Great  cander, who was hid behind  Curtain of Madam de Montesp Bed, spoke to him, in order to
sure him, in case he were afraid, d bid him fear nothing. Mon∣ur Clement answered him, that  was not afraid, and having ap∣roached his Patient, he felt her, d finding that the Child was not t ready to come into the World,  asked Alcander, who was near m, whether the place where they ere, was the House of God, where  was permitted neither to Eat,  Drink, that for his part, he as very Hungry, and that they would do him a great kindness to ve him something to Eat. The Great Alcander, without aying for either of the Women, ho were in the Chamber, be∣ired himself to serve him, he ent immediately into a Closet, om whence he took a Pot of weat Meats, and brought it to im, then from the other side, he ch'd some Bread, which he like∣wise gave him, and bid him not  spare either the one, or the o∣ther;
for there was more yet the Lodgings. After Monsieur  ment had eaten two or three M¦sels, he asked whether they wo not give him any thing to Dri the Great Alcander ran himself  to the Closet, to fetch him a ¦le of Wine, and filled him two  three Glasses, one after another When Monsieur Clement had dr the first Glass, he asked Alcande if he also would not drink, a the Great Alcander having answer¦ed, no, he told him, that the si Lady would not have so happy a speedy a deliverance, unless  drank a Glass to her Health. The Great Alcander did n think it proper, to reply to t discourse, and a pang, which  that time took Madam de Mon¦tespan, interrupted the Conversa¦tion; in the mean time, she he Alcander by the hand, who en¦couraged her to take heart, a asked Clement every moment,
e business would not be soon done. er Labour was hard enough, ough it was not very long, and adam de Montespan was brought  bed of a brave Boy, at which e Great Alcander expressed a great al of satisfaction, but he would t have it presently told Madam Montespan for fear it might be rtful to her Health. Monsieur Clement having done ery thing that belonged to his fession, the Great Alcander fil∣d him himself a Glass of Wine, er which he teturned behind e Bed Curtain, because they were  light a Candle, to the end that onsieur Clement might see, if all ngs were well, before his de∣ture. Clement having assured em, that the Lady in the Straw s out of all danger, she, who nt to fetch him, gave him a se wherein there were an hun∣d Lewidores, and being again od-wink't, they lead him to a
Coach, which carried him h to his own House, after havi made many more turns than it h done in coming. In the mean time Monsieur  Lausun did endeavour to comfo himself in some others Arms, and ing very proud that the Great Alcan¦der had only his leavings; he d not at all envy his good Fortune either because he had never had  reall Passion for Madam de Montes∣pan, or for that he had found o in her some secret imperfection which her Husband himself d attribute unto her. However  did not omit to make use of h Favour in those things, which  would not ask himself, and Ma¦dam de Montespan, who had gi¦ven him so great advantages over her, durst deny him nothing, fo fear that he should ruin her with the Great Alcander, with whom h had no less power than her self.  the mean time, as we seldom have
a great kindness for those whom  stand in awe of, so she would any rate have rid her self of , but she durst not yet attempt  for fear of not being powerful ough to bring it about. While  was in these Sentiments, the ce of a Lady of Honour, to the eat Alcander's Queen became ide, by the Dutchess of Mon∣zier's Death, and the Dutchess  Richlieu, and of Crequi, preten∣ding both to it, each made use of r Friends for the obtaining it. Madam de Montespan declared her f for the Dutchess of Richlieu, and onsieur de Lausun for the Dutchess  Crequi, which began to sow an en Division betwixt them. For Monsieur de Lausun would by all eans force Madam de Montespan  desist from speaking, in the be∣half of the Dutchess of Richlieu, nd Madam de Montespan, who ould not honourably give over, er having gone so far, thought
it strange that Monsieur de Lausun when he knew that she had un¦dertaken that Affair, should com in her way, to take the Interest of the Dutchess of Crequi. It was the Great Alcanders part to deci in favour, either of his Mistress or of his Favourite; but th Prince being unwilling to discon¦tent either of them, staid a long while without disposing of tha place, hoping that they would a¦gree together, and that their re¦union would give him an oppor∣tunity to resolve. But on the con¦trary, his delay, making as well the one as the other believe, tha the Great Alcander had no regard to their Prayers, they bore against each other a greater grudge than they did before, and even Mon∣sieur de Lausun began to talk disad∣vantageously of Madam de Mon∣tespan, which she could not hea of without desiring to be notably revenged.
Madam de Montespan complain∣ed of it to the Great Alcander, who gave Monsieur de Lausun a vere reprimand. But he so much e more enraged against her, as e faw that her Credit prevailed ove his, for the Great Alcander d just then, given the Dutchess  Montauziers place to the Du∣tchess of Richlieu, could not for ar to take the liberty of railing against her upon all occasions. The reat Alcander being informed of  by others, besides Madam de Montespan, did again sharply re∣prehend Monsieur de Lausun, who rceiving that the Great Alcan∣der understood no rallery upon t point, promised him to be more reet for the future and to let him see, that he designed to live ndlily thereafter with Madam  Montespan, he desired him to▪ concile them, which the Great Alcander promised him to do. In effect having disposed Ma∣dam
de Montespan's Spirit to par¦don him, he made them on th morrow embrace in his Presence obliging Monsieur de Lausun  ask her Pardon for what he h done, and to promise her not  do so any more. This reconcilement being made Monsieur de Lausun had mo power than ever, upon the Great Alcanders Spirit, and whereas th Favourite's Ambition was beyond all measure, which nothing cou satisfie, he gave way to some thought of Marrying the Princess Ma¦damoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier, th Great Alcanders Cousin Germai which his Sister, that Princess's Confi¦dent, had long ago put into his hea The Princess was already of  Age well advanced, but she be¦ing extraordinarily Rich, and Mon¦sieur de Lausun esteeming that Qua¦lity, and the Blood from which she was descended, more than all other Ornaments of Face and Body, he
desired his Sister to continue her Cares for him, and in the prospect f arriving unto so great a Match, e made very close Court to Ma∣dam de Montespan, not doubting ut that her Credit, might be very useful to him upon that occasion. Although the Interest that Mon∣sieur de Lausun had in the Great Alcanders Heart, made him pre∣sume very much upon his Favour, nevertheless he believing, that the King would never give his Con∣sent willingly to that Alliance, de∣sired to engage him to it out of interest. To this effect, he dis∣patched a Gentleman, in whom he had a great deal of confidence, to the Duke of Lorrain, who was de∣prived of his Country, to offer him a Settlement of five hundred thou∣sand Livres of yearly Rent out of Lands, to him, and to his Heirs, upon Condition, that he would resigne his Rights to him. The Duke of Lorrain, who saw no great
appearance of being ever able to recover his own Estate, relish that proposal, and Monsieur de Lau¦sun seeing it likely to succeed, ex¦pressed something of it to the Great Alcander, to whom he insinuated that it would be very advantage¦ous for him, that the Duke of Lor¦rain gave up his Pretensions to some one, who would render him Faith and Homage for the Duke¦dom of Lorrain. The Great Alcander having ap∣proved of the thing, Monsieur de Lausun discovered to him, that with the design of doing him this Ser∣vice, he had harkened to some pro∣posals of Marriage, which had been made to him in the part of the Princess, Madamoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier, by the mediation of his Sister. He asked his Pardon, for giving him no earlier notice of it; which he believed he ought not to have done, until he had first endeavoured to dispose of matters so,
as to take effect. Saying far∣er, that it was his part to ap∣prove of this Match, which, though  appeared to be very extraordi∣nary, was not however without example: That it was not the first me, that Mortals were allied to e Blood of the Gods, and that istory taught him, that many en, who were of no better Fa∣mily than himself, had arrived to at Honour. The Great Alcander was sur∣prized at this proposal, which ap∣peared very bold for a Man of Monsieur de Lausun's Rank, yet con∣sidering that this was not the first time, that a Princess of the Blood oyal had Married a private Gen∣tleman, and reflecting upon the advantages, which he himself might ap from this Alliance, he soon accustomed himself to hearken to it. Madam de Montespan, whom Mon∣sieur de Lausun had engaged to his rests, finding the Great Alcan∣der
already well inclined, did  dextrously represent to him, t little difference that there was  France, between Gentlemen, wh they were once become Duke (which he might easily cre Monsieur de Lausun) and stran Princes (to one of which he h not long ago given a Sister of Ma¦damoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier that he finally resolved in fav of the Match. When the Great Alcander h thus signified his approbation it to Madam de Montespan, he to some measures with her and wi Monsieur de Lausun, in order  clear himself to the World from all the blame, for his assenting this Marriage; which he did be¦lieve could not be better done, th by seeming to have been force to give consent to it. To effe this he desired two things, t one, that Madamoiselle d'Or¦leans Monpensier should come
self, to intreat him to give her Monsieur de Lausun in Marriage, e other, that the most considera∣e of Monsieur de Lausun's Rela∣tions, should come in a Body to desire permission for their Kinsman  marry that Princess. They saw en these Ambassadours, and this mbassadress arrive all at a time, d those having first obtained Au∣dience, they told the Great Alcan∣der, that although the favour which they were to desire from him in behalf of their Kinsman, should seem above their merit, and even their hopes, nevertheless they in∣cated him to consider, that it would be a means to induce the Gen∣try to greater matters, each one hop∣ing for the future, to be able to attain∣ so great an Honour, as a re∣compence for his Services. They also represented to the Great Alcander, what I have a∣ove pointed at, (viz.) that Gen∣tlemen have ere now obtained the
like Grace, so that the Great Al¦cander, seeming to be persuade by their Prayers, answered the that for their sakes, as being th Chief Gentry of his Realm, e would be glad that their Kinsman should have the honour of Espous¦ing the Princess, Madamoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier; but y that he desired to know from her self, whether she was willingly enclined to this Alliance; of which he was as yet altogether igno∣rant. Then the Princess entred, wh without considering, that it was not very usual for Women to desir Men in Marriage, intreated the Great Alcander to permit her to marry Monsieur de Lausun, which he at first denyed, but after  manner, that let her see, it was only for fashion's sake, then the Princess renewed her Prayers, and at length obtained what she requi∣red.
The news of this Marriage made  great deal of noise, not only o∣ the whole Realm, but even uch farther; none could forbear miring at the Effects of For∣ne, that did so much favour so deserving a Person; than whom,  his hidden Virtues be except∣, there were thousands more orthy in the Kingdom. In the mean time, though Mon∣eur de Lausun had a great deal  cunning, yet he committed a eat Errour upon this occasion;  instead of Marrying the Princess Madamoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier,  soon as he had obtained the Great lcander's consent, he would make eat preparations for his Nuptials, d that having delayed them for me days, the Prince of Conde, d his Son, cast himself at the ings Feet, to intreat him not to ffer the conclusion of a thing so graceful to the Royal Family, and hile the Great Alcander knew not
what to resolve upon, being on  side combated by their Reason and on the other, by the Prom which he had made to Monsieur de Lausun's Kindred. Monsieur joyned in Petition with these Prin¦cess, and made him resolve to  tract his word. Madam de Mon¦tespan, for her part, though she penly appeared to act for Monsieur de Lausun, yet she endeavoured derhand to break the Match, fe¦ing that if he were once allyed  the Royal Family, he might have yet a greater influence upon Al¦cander's Spirit, over which she de¦sired to reign alone. In the mean time the Great Al¦cander had so great a weakness to¦wards Monsieur de Lausun, that e knew not how to declare his Plea¦sure to him; but there being a ne¦cessity of doing it, he caused hi to come into his Cabinet, and ther told him, that after having through¦ly reflected on his Marriage, he
would not have him proceed to conclusion of it; that in every g else he would give him marks is Affection, but that he must nothing more to him of that, e did design to retain his Fa∣vour. Monsieur de Lausun finding by s Language, that some body d rendred him ill Offices with  Great Alcander, thought it ould be in vain for him to en∣deavour to prevail with him, but ing immediately to Madam de Montespans Lodgings, whom he respected, he told her every thing at rage and passion could dictate a transported Mad man; he ld her, I say, that he had been to ame to confide in a Woman of er condition, since he ought to ave known, that such as she, - ha∣ving once forfeited their own Ho∣ours, might well do the same by their Lovers; that he would em∣ploy all the Credit he had with the
Great Alcander, to bring him b out of a Love, that ruined hi in the world, and of which  did not know the unworthines▪ He said to her many more thing with the same violence; after which he went to Madamoiselle d'Or¦leans Monpensier, to whom he de¦clared the Great Alcanders pleasu The Princess had no sooner hear this news, but she fell into a Tran and all the Water in the Sci would not have been enough  recover her out of it; if Mon¦sieur de Lausun had not put hi Face to hers, to tell her in her ear, that it was not time to be thus desperate, but rather to take suc measures as might defend then both from the hatred of their Ene¦mies, and secure their Pleasures that to effect this, they must us extream diligence, for the loss o one only moment drew after i strange Consequences; that as fo himself, he was of opinion, tha
without taking any notice of the reat Alcander's Orders, they should privately Married; that when the ing were once done, he would well enough pleased with it, ce he had already consented to  But that whatever happened, thing should hinder their constant telligence and communication. The Princess recovered out of  Trance, at so eloquent and so reeable a discourse, and being th shut up together in a Closer, ey called to them the Countess Nogent for a third, who con∣med them, that they could not ke a resolution more advanta∣geous to their happiness, and con∣t. However it was resolved in s Counsel, that she should go aight to find out the Great Al∣cander, to try if she could not ke him change his Sentiment,  indeed she took Coach that y moment, for that purpose. The Great Alcander being ad∣iled, that she desired to speak
with him in private, easily gu at her business, and although was resolved not to grant her quest, yet since he could not h somely dispence with himself  giving her Audience, he made  enter his Closet, having first com¦manded all those, that were w him there, to depart. The Prin¦cess threw her self at his Feet,  covering her Face with her Hand¦kerchief, not so much to wipe way her Tears, as to hide her con¦fusion: She said to him, That there acted a part, that ought confound herewith shame, if he hi¦self had not given her confident in approving of, as he had do Monsieur de Lausun's intention that it was thereupon that she  taken some engagements, which we not easie for her to break; that though it was not over decent, a person of her Sex, to talk af that manner. Yet the Merit Monsieur de Lausun, to whom ev
himself could not refuse his Af∣fections, might well serve her for excuse, and in fine, that whoso∣ever would consider that her flames re once authorized, and approved er King, would not possibly find r so much in fault, as they might eed imagine. The Great Alcander, who had eral times commanded her to e, without being obeyed, told r, when he saw that she had gi∣n over speaking, that unless she ould put her self into another sture, he had no answer to make r, then the Princess rose up, pecting with an unconceivable r, the Sentence either of her Life Death. But the Great Alcander  not leave her long in uncer∣nty, telling her, That the remorse which he felt, for consenting to her riage with Monsieur de Lausun,  sufficiently punish't him for that akness, that it was a thing that should repent of during his whole
life, and that he could not i how she, who had always sh courage above her Sex, could re upon an action, that would re her for ever infamous. Madamoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier, having received this swer, returned home with rage her Heart, against the Great cander, and having found Mon¦sieur de Lausun, who waited w impatience for the news of w she had done, they agreed toge¦ther, that seeing nothing was  to move him, they must b cretly Married. A Priest was so found for that purpose, and th were Married in the Princess's  set; but they expected from i and fortune some favourable op¦portunity of divulging the Ma¦riage. In the mean time the Weddi could not be consummated so cretly, but that the Great Alcander had notice of it from one of t
Princess's Domesticks, whom Mon∣sieur de Louvoy, an Enemy to Mon∣sieur de Lausun, had gained to vertise him of every thing that uld pass in her Family. The t Alcander expressed very much ger at it. Monsieur de Louvoy, d Madam de Montespan, who ld intelligence together for the truction of Monsieur de Lau∣sun, did endeavour to enflame it  the more. For Monsieur de Lausun had ill used Monsieur de Lou∣voy upon several occasions, and Monsieur de Louvoy sought to be venged all manner of ways. Nevertheless they counselled the eat Alcander to dissemble his sentment, either because they  not believe that they could yet ocure Monsieur de Lausun's ab∣ute ruin, or for that they ap∣prehended to offend the Princess, who did not willingly pardon those om she once had reason to be gry with: The King did there∣fore
continue in appearance to  Monsieur de Lausun, as he▪  formerly, but he gave Monsieur de Louvoy Order to watch him narrowly, as that he might g him an account of his Conduc In the mean time Monsieur Lausun, being already of a Na that was but too much addict to Pride, did after his late W¦ding grow every day prouder a prouder, so that almost all t Court were become his Enemi However he underwent all t with an extraordinary haughtine but there soon fell out an accide that did occasion his disgra which was long ago designed. The Count de Guiche, Eldest S to the Mareschal de Granmont, w a Colonel of a Regiment of t Great Alcanders Guards, and w banished by the Great Alcan for some designes, much resembli Monsieur de Lausun's, that is say, for having presumed to lo
Monsieur's Wife. At length in consideration of the Mareschal, for whom Alcander had a great kind∣ness, he permitted his Son to re∣turn. Nevertheless upon condi∣tion, that he should quit his Of∣fice. Now the Count de Guiche's Office, being without contradiction one of the fairest, and most con∣siderable in all the Great Alcan∣ders's Court, all those who had a∣ny Credit with him, pretended to ; and amongst the rest, Mon∣sieur de Lausun, whom the Great Alcander had not long since made a Captain of his Guardes; yet he durst not demand it himself, ei∣ther for that he perceived, that he did begin to decline in his favour, r because he would not every moment importune him for fresh Graces. He had made his peace in appea∣rance with Madam de Montespan, who to make him fall the more readily into the Net, had seemed
to pardon him. Monsieur de Lau¦sun believing therefore, that  would not deny him her medi¦tion, for the obtaining of that Of¦fice, did pray her, that she would be pleased to serve him therein but desired her not to tell t Great Alcander, that he had ma her that request. Madam de Mon¦tespan, did promise him to do it but going immediately to find o the Great Alcander, she told him that Monsieur de Lausun was no become altogether a Mystery, th he had made her promise him t demand the Count de Guiche's Of¦fice for him; but that at the same time, he had exacted from he not to discover, that he had desire it; that she could not imagine why he practised all these slight with a Prince, who had heape upon him so many Favours, an still continued to heap upon him more and more every day; that admit there were no reason to be
lieve, that he might have ill de∣signes in demanding that Office, t she would not grant it him,  she were in his place, since all is goodness towards him deserved t least, in acknowlegment, a de∣monstration of more freedom. Although Monsieur de Lausun's proceedings had nothing in the bottom, yet since Madam de Mon∣tespan gave it the blackest Colours at she could, the Great Alcander reflected upon it, and telling Ma∣dam de Montespan, that he could not comprehend what designe Mon∣sieur de Lausun might have, Ma∣dam de Montespan advised him to discourse himself with him about t, to see if he would still continue is slights. The Great Alcander did approve of this advice, and be∣ing shut up with Monsieur de Lau∣sun in his Closet, after having en∣tertained him with a discourse of several matters, he began to talk of those, who aspired to the Count
de Guiche's Office; telling him, th he had no intention to gratifie ¦ny of those People, whom he did not think sufficiently experience to supply so considerable a charg Monsieur de Lausun overjoyed  find the Great Alcander of th opinion, endeavoured to confi him in it, by adding to what  had said of these Persons, something to their disadvantage. But Mon¦sieur de Lausun not coming of him¦self, to what the Great Alcander would have had him, that is to say, to beg that Office for himself The Great Alcander asked him, it would not fit him, and if  had no desire to have it. Mon¦sienr de Lausun replied, that after having received so many Favour from his Majesty, he had no min to pretend to any new, so th he durst assure him, that he nev had the least thought of it. Th Great Alcander told him that he had however believed it, because
Madam de Montespan had spoke  him about it in his behalfe, which he did not believe she would have done, unless he had desired  of her; that he could not con∣ceive, why he made a Mystery of  thing, to which he might pre∣tend as well as so many others, d desired him to tell him the th of it. Monsieur de Lausun being himself prest in that man∣ner by the Great Alcander, swore o him again, that he had never ought of it; Whereupon the Great Alcander, with a meen able o make Monsieur de Lausun trem∣ble, told him, that he was exteam∣ amazed at the boldness which e had to lye to him so impudent∣, that he needed not to disguise himself any longer, since Madam de Montespan had told him all; nd that he might assure himself, hat he would never give the least dit to any thing that he might y hereafter; at the same time
the Great Alcander rose up, a having dismist him without hea¦ning to his excuses, Monsieur  Lausun departed full of despair and rage. At his going out of the Great Alcander's Closet, he met the Du of Crequi, who seeing him qui altered, asked him what was t matter, to which Monsieur de Lau¦sun replied, that he was a wretch who had the Rope about his Neck and that he, who would strangl him, should be the best of his friends▪ From thence he went to Ma¦dam de Montespan's Lodgings where he put upon her all man¦ner of affronts, and even gave he so gross Language, as it was not to be believed, that a Man of Qua∣lity could have such in his mouth. Madam de Montespan told him, that unless she hoped the Great Alcander would do her justice, she her self would that very moment▪ have scratched out his Eyes; but
that she would now remit all her revenge to the King. After he had once more given her all the foulest and basest Lan∣guage, that despaire and rage could inspire him with; he went to Madamoiselle d'Orleans Mon∣pensier's, whom he could not caress as he was accustomed, so much had the dejection of his Spirit con∣tributed to the dejection of his Body. In the mean time the Prin∣cess being thus disappointed, was very desirous to know whence that proceeded, swearing to him, that the matter should be very difficult, if she endeavoured not to bring a remedy to it. Monsieur de Lausun believing himself obliged to tell her what it was, imparted to her the con∣versation which he had had with the Great Alcander, and the Visit which he afterwards made to Madam de Montespan, not concealing a Sylla∣ble of all the disobliging things, that he had said unto her.
The Princess, to whom, Ag had given more Experience, ve much blamed Monsieur de Lausun (who had indeed naturally a great deal of Wit, but very little Judg¦ment) for what he had done, telling him that all truths were not to be spoken at all times. She appre¦hended the Great Alcander's Re¦sentment, and fearing, that th conjuncture might be destructive to her Pleasures, she did what she could to enjoy them still for the time, out of a fear that she should not be long permitted, to have them, as often as she would have a mind to them. In effect the Great Alcander, ha∣ving understood, that Monsieur de Lausun, notwithstanding his Or∣ders so often repeated to the con∣trary, had again railed at Madam de Montespan, resolved to have him, apprehended; Monsieur de Louvoy's Remonstrances, who did not cease: to tell him, that he could
not otherwise reduce that Spirit o reason, were of great use to confirm him in this resolution, and to overcome all the returns of kind∣ness which he had for that unde serving Favourite. The Order for the seizing him was given to the Chevalier de Fourbins, Major of the Life-guard, who presently con∣veyed himself to Monsieur de Lau∣sun's House, where having learn't, that he was gone to Paris, he left  Souldier to watch near the Gate, with order to come and give him notice, as soon as he should be re∣turned. Monsieur de Lausun ar∣rived about an hour or two after, and the Souldier having gi∣ven the Chevalier de Fourbins no∣tice of it, the Chevalier de Four∣bins having first placed some Guards about the House, entred into it, and found him near the fire, little dreaming of his misfortune. For as soon as he saw the Chevalier come towards him, he asked him, if the
Great Alcander had sent for him to which the Chevalier de Four∣bins answered, No, but that he had sent him to demand his Sword that he was sorry to be charge with such a Commission, but where as he was obliged to do whatever his Master commanded him, he could not dispence with himself from executing it. It is easiy to judge of Monsieur de Lausun's surprize, at so unex∣pected a Complement, for although he had given the Great Alcander cause to deal much more rigo∣rously with him, yet since Men an more apt to flatter themselves, than to do themselves Justice, he belie∣ved that the kindness which the King had always shewn towards him, would prevail above his re∣sentment. He asked the Cheva∣lier de Fourbins, whether he might not speak with the King, but the Chevalier having told him that it was forbidden, he gave himself
over to despaire. They kept as rict a Guard upon him all that ight, as they could have done on the greatest Criminal in the World, and the Chevalier de Four∣bins having on the morrow de∣vered him into the hands of Mon∣ur d'Artagnan, Captain Lieute∣nant of Dragoons, Monsieur de ausun look't upon himself as a ined Man; because Monsieur de tagnan had never been his friend, d, he believed, that he was cho∣ out on purpose, to make the Great Alcander's indignation the etter known. Monsieur d'Artagnan, having ken Orders from Monsieur de voy by the Great Alcanders ommand, conducted Monsieur de Lausun to Pierre Anise, and from ence to Pignerol, where they  him up in a Room with  Windows, not setting him  speak with any one whomsoe∣ver, and having only some Books
for his Companions, together w his Valet de Chambre, who was no permitted to go out. The Affliction, which he con¦ceived to see himself fallen from so high a Fortune into so depl¦rable a Condition, soon reduc him to that extremity, that  life was despaired of, and he being once fallen into a Lethargy, it w so credibly believed, that he w deceased, that a Courrier was d¦patch'd to the Great Alcander,  give him notice of his Death; b in six hours afterwards, there a¦ved another, who brought the Ne of his return to life again, at whi there was neither joy nor grief  press't, I mean in general, eve one esteeming him already as  Man, who was dead at least to t World. In the mean time, Madamoisel d'Orleans Monpensier, being in de¦paire, because the pleasures, which she had expected to enjoy with hi
were so suddenly vanish't, suffred  much the more torment, in that  durst not make the least ap∣pear. However the most intimate of her Friends endeavoured all they ould to lessen her Affliction; but ce they were not always with er, and especially by night, du∣ng which the Senses are usually he most tormented, they rather contributed to render her more retched by thus renewing the remembrance of her misfortune, than brought her any comfort. et her greatest Misery was, that e durst not complain; for since r Marriage was secret, she truly dged that her Sorrows must be lso secret, unless she would resolve  expose her self to the laugh∣ter, not only of her Enemies, but en of all France, who had their eyes turned upon her, to see after hat manner she would take her od Friends disgrace. Neverthe∣less that did not hinder her from
taking the Man who mana Monsieur de Lausuns business; a making him her Steward; nor fr receiving into her Service his Gen¦tleman, and the most faithful  his Domesticks, who were o joyed to save themselves in t Port, after their Masters Shipwra In the mean time, the Great ¦cander, just as if Monsieur de L¦sun had never been his Favouri heard every thing that was said him, without being concerned  it, or even without answering  it; which was the reason that the who were still his Friends, w were but very few in number dared no longer to speak in his  half. Neither did hardly any p¦sume to Petition for the Count  Guiche's Employment; for all m knowing, that it had been a stu¦bling block to that Favourite, th seared, least it might have the sa effect for others, as it had for him yet while they were in daily
ectation of the Man, to whom e Great Alcander would give it, ey were all surprized, when one orning at his rising, he told the ke de la Feuillade, that if he could ocure fifty thousand Crowns, he ould give him the rest to pur∣se the Count de Guiche's Em∣ployment, to whom he must pay own six hundred thousand Li∣es, before he could have his Re∣nation. The Duke de la Feuilla∣ smilingly answered the Great Alcander, that he should easily pro∣re them, if he would be his se∣curity; and after having seriously thanked him for the Favour which  did him, he took leave of him o go to Paris, to fetch the sum, at the Great Alcander demand∣ed of him. The News of what the Great Al∣cander had done for him, being pread amongst all the Courtiers, he et a great number of them in the tichamber, and upon the Stairs,
who came to make him their Com¦plements; but without half hea¦ing them out, he returned in the Great Alcander's Chamber,  whom he said, that Men need  longer have recourse to Saints  see Miracles, since His Majesty d greater than all the Saints in Pa¦radise; that when he came in th Morning he had not been regarded by any body, because none di believe that his Majesty would d that which he had done for hi but that as soon as the favou which he had granted him, w known, all prest with emulation one of another to make him pro¦fers of their Service; but that they were proffers of Service after the Court Mode only, that is to say that no man had offered him h Purse, to take thence the fifty thousand Crowns which he wanted The Great Alcander laught a Duke of Feuillade's jest, and seeing him return in as much hast as he
came, he told him that he need not o so fast, if he had nothing to o at Paris, but to seek the Mo∣ey; that he was willing to lend  him, but upon condition, that e should pay it again, when he re able. Thus the Great Alcander having  a day ruined one Favourite, rai∣d another almost in as little time; r it is apparent, that the morn∣ing whereon the King made the Duke de la Feuillade this Present, is Affairs were in so bad a con∣tion, that one of his Coach Hor∣s being dead, he had not money enough by him to buy another. Although Monsieur de Lausuns disgrace had deprived the Court dies of one of their best Com∣tants, yet since every moment presented them with fresh Men to enter the Lists, the vigour of those did comfort them for the loss of the other; and he was no sooner ut of sight, but they forgot all
his Braveries. Among the young Men, who presented themselves  supply his place, the Duke of Lon¦gueville was without doubt the most considerable both for Bir and Fortune; for he was descend¦ed from Princess, who had p¦sest the Crown, before it fell  that Branch, from whence the Gre Alcander was sprung, and he ha an Estate of six hundred thousand Livres a year, in Land, to main¦tain so Illustrious a Descent. A for his Person, his Youth was ac¦companied with a Je ne sai qui that rendred him very Charming wherefore although he was neither of so good a Presence, nor of so graceful an Air, as many other were, yet he failed not to please all the Women in general; so that he no sooner appeared at Court but they all had designes upon hi Person. The Mareschaless de la Ferte was one of those, and thirty seve¦
thirty eight years, which had st over her head, not permitting r to hope, that he would pre∣ her before so many others, who were much younger and fairer an her self, she believed that it ould not be amiss for her to ake him some advances, and that ese advances might serve her in∣ad of Merit. One day that the uke of Longueville, with several hers, was at play at her House, which was the usual Rendezvous of  the People of Quality, who had nothing to do, she intreated him  come to see her, at an hour in e morning, that she knew none se would be there, at which time, e had the pleasure of entertain∣ing him with all freedom; but  very little purpose, for the young inee was as yet so raw in A∣morous Mysteries, that he did no understand the meaning of an hun∣dred wanton loks, and ish tricks, which would have sufficiently ad∣vertised
any other, that had b more experienced than himself▪ Nevertheless, seeing that  Mareschaless, old as she was, h not displeased him, he came ∣gain on the morrow to see her the same hour, and finding her her Toilet, he told her that would make her a Present of admirable Powder; the Maresc¦less asked him what Powder it w and the Duke of Longueville h¦ving replied, that it was pol¦ville, he had hardly let the w fall, when she cryed out, that  would dispence with him fro sending for it, that it was an ab¦minable Powder, and that she, w had invented it, deserved to  burnt. She immediately asked t Duke of Longueville, whether did make use of it, and the Du having answered, Yes; She bid h not come near her, for that Pow¦der was worse than the Plague. T Duke, who did not know wh
e meant, desired her to explain e Riddle, and the Mareschaless ving enquired of him, whether  had not heard the Count de ux's Story, and he having repli∣, No; she told him that he must  informed of it from himself, and r that she did believe that he ould use no more Polleville. She would not tell him any ing more untill her head was essed, but her dressing Woman ing gone, she then told him, that e Count de Saux having had  Assignation with Madam de uvres, did not come off with honour, by reason of Polleville; and that she verily believed, that the same thing would befall him, he were in the like Rencounter. That reproach made the Duke of Longueville laugh, and whereas the force of youth made him be∣lieve, that he did not hate the Ma∣reschaless whom he had found a handsome Woman at her looking
Glass; he told her that he had  day used Polleville, but that  would make it appear, that  same thing should not befall h as did happen to the Count  Saux. Whereupon he began caress her, and the Maresch seeming to be angry at his b¦ness, to provoke him the mo resisted him, until she was n the Bed, upon which she let h self fall, and there she tryed, th what was said of the Count  Saux, was an effect of his weak¦ness, and not of Polleville. The Duke of Longueville ove joyed at his Adventure, used  like a young Man, which did n at all displease the Mareschaless She intreated him to be secret, and made him understand, that she had a severe Husband, who would take nothing for raillry, if he on had happened to discover, that the had any familiarity together. The Duke of Longueville promised he
that he would act very discreetly, and that she should have reason to be satisfied with his Conduct, but he,  his part desired her not to mmit any infidelity against him, ding that he would forsake her at very moment, wherein any ing of that nature should arrive  his knowledge. That Law was very severe to the Mareschaless, who till then had believed, that one Man was too tle for one Woman, but she be∣g much in love with the Duke, d besides, having just then ex∣perienced, that he was worth two ordinary Men she resolved to strug∣gle with her Nature to keep her ord with him, as long as she uld. Therefore from that day, e dismist the Marquis Deffiat, ho endeavoured to obtain her avour, and would certainly have und speedy success, had it not en for the Duke of Longueville's prohibition.
The Marquis of Deffiat was  little Man, wilful and brave, though he did not love the W addicted to Pleasures, and unca∣pable of reasoning, when some ¦cy had once taken him in the h He found much severity in  Mareschaless's command, w whom he was almost come to bargain, and not doubting, but t there was some other Lover in  Field, he immediately suspect the Duke of Longueville. His sus¦picions being fallen upon him, though she received Visits from many others, he was vexed to h to do with a Prince, with who he durst not fight without expres¦sing himself to dangerous conse¦quences. However, his Passion being more strong than his Reason, he would before he quarrelled with him, certainly informed, if he were  in a mistake, and having for the purpose sent several Spies abro
e was one day advised of a meet∣ing that those Lovers had toge∣ther; whereupon he wrapt him∣self up in a great Cloak, and stood watching before the Door, that he might be the more certain, whether it were true or no. When he had seen with his own Eyes, that he had been told nothing but ruth, he resolved to quarrel with the Duke of Longueville upon the first opportunity, and having met him soon after, he told him in his ar, that he desired to see him with his Sword in hand, the Duke of Longueville answered him with∣out any emotion, that he ought to learn to know himself, and that she might fight with his equal, but as for him, he had been instructed never to meddle with Fellows, whose Ancestors have not long been known. This was a sensible reproach to the Marquis de Deffiat, of whose raction the World had no great
Opinion; nevertheless since th were several others in the pl where he had spoken to the Duke of Longueville, he went from him without making any thing appe and without giving any suspici of what he had said unto him. The Duke of Longueville depart in a little time after, but having several Pages and Lacquaies in h train, Deffiat believed it prop to wait for some more favourable opportunity to get satisfaction▪ bot for the affront which was just th given him, and for the stealing a way of his Mistress from him. In the mean time, the Duke of Longueville, seeing that Deffiat did not follow him, took that for an effect of his Cowardise, which was only an effect of his Judgment; so that he began to speak ill of hi upon that score, which being re∣ported to Deffiat, put him into suc an excess of anger, that he reso¦ved to be revenged, though it should
ove his utter ruine▪ To this ef∣fect he employed two or three ies, to bring him notice when the Duke of Longueville went a∣broad alone, which he often did, having besides his Intrigue with the Mareschaless, some Amours in the own, which gave him employment, d within two or three days af∣ter, one of his Spies having ad∣ertised him, that the Duke went but all alone in a Chair, and was one to some appointment, he po∣ed himself upon the way, and s the Duke returned about two hours after Midnight, he presen∣ted himself before him with a Cane n one hand, and a Sword in the other, and called to him to come out, or he would use him scurvi∣ly; the Duke of Longueville, ha∣ving immediately caused his Chair∣men to stop, would have hand∣led his Sword, but Deffiat assault∣ing him before he had time to draw it, gave him some blows with
the Cane, which the Chair men seeing, they took the Staves out of the Chair, and would have knoc the Marquis on the head with them▪ if he had not judged it proper  avoid their fury, by a speedy flight▪ It is easie to comprehend the Duke's despair, after so sensible an affront, and how much he de¦sired to revenge it; he forbad the Chair-men ever to speak of this accident, neither did he ever speak of it himself to any, but to one of his best Frends, who advised him to make no complaint of it, for altho' the Great Alcander would not fail to give the Marquis an exemplary punishment; yet he did not believe, that a Prince, who had received such an affront, ought to revenge himself by the Ministry of another; he told him, that he had nothing else to do, but to cause his Enemy to be Assassinated, which indeed was the only method he could take upon such an occasion, for
although it were not generous  commit actions of that nature; t, since to Challenge Deffiat ould expose him again▪ to be aten, it was not just, and espe∣cially for a Prince, to receive two ronts at the same time. The Duke being resolved, what∣er hapned, to follow this advice, ght after nothing more than me opportunity of accomplish∣ing it; but it was a very difficult matter; because Deffiat after ha∣ving committed such an extrava∣gancy, never went abroad with∣out being well attended, and al∣ways stood upon his Guard. In the mean time, it happened that the Mareschaless de la Ferte be∣came big with Child, which very much alarm'd her; for whereas he did not lye with her Husband, who had long laine bedrid with the Gout, she well imagined, that if he once came to know it, he would lock her up immediate∣ly
for the rest of her life. That was therefore a necessity of us a great deal of precaution to con¦ceal her great Belly from him but she discovered it to the Duke of Longueville, who overjoyed  see himself likely to have O spring, although he was as yet but very young himself, loved the Ma¦resehaless the more tenderly for i When she was four or five Months gone, she would no longer ver¦ture to go into the Mareschal Chamber; but sitting up at pla all night, she lay in Bed all day causing her meat to be brought thither to her, and never rose, un∣til the Gamesters returned, before whom, she never stirred from her Seat, for fear they should disco∣ver, that which she earnestly de∣sired, should be concealed from all the World. Although the Mareschal mi∣strusted nothing, yet he failed not to find fault with that manner of living,
and having sent his Wife ord, that he would be glad to ak with her, she ventured into s Chamber, where he reprehend∣ her for it to purpose; but the Mareschaless, who desired only some pretence not to return thither any ore, seemed to be very much of∣fended at his correction; so that he discourse growing hot between em, they gave each other a great deal of ill Language, which gave the Mareschaless an opportunity to tell him, that he should quar∣rel with her when she came next to see him, and at the same time itting his Chamber, she never et her foot in it again, until after her lying in. When she was within a Month of six Weeks of her time, she feign∣ed an indisposition to rid her self of the Company that frequented her, and her time being come, she lay in in her own House, just as if she had been with Child by her
own Husband. It was Monsieur Clement that delivered her, a the Duke of Longueville who was present at her Labour, made him promise to keep it secret, and gave him 200 Pistols. In the mean time Monsieur Cle¦ment had many such windfals, f in a little time after, Madam  Montespan being again with Chil by the Great Alcander, she had re¦course to him, and he was brought after the same manner, and with the same Ceremony as he had been before; however there was some difference in his reward; he ha¦ving had this last time two hun¦dred Lewidores, whereas he had only one hundred the first time and the same measures were always observed with him, as often as there was use for him; he having had as far as to four hundred Lewidores, for the fourth Child that he delivered Madam de Mon∣tespan of: But whether it were that
it appeared a little too extraordi∣nary to this Lady, who was na∣turally very saving, or that she had some other reasons for it, she ha∣ving again conceived by the Great Alcander, and being obliged to go into the Country, she sent to bar∣gain with Clement, to send her one of his Deputies to Mainte∣non, where she had resolved to ly in. She passed there for one of the Marchioness of Maintenon's best Friends, so that the Deputy, who delivered her, did not know, that he had brought the Great Alcan∣der's Mistress to bed. In the mean time, to return to the Duke of Longueville, who finding (as I have already said) no opportunity to be revenged of Def∣fiat, he was obliged to make him∣self ready to follow the Great Al∣cander, who had declared War with the Hollanders. This Campagne was extreamly glorious to this Great Prince; but fatal to the Duke
of Longueville, for he being am¦sed at a debauch, an hour or two before the Great Alcander made h Troops pass over the Rhine, th Wine caused him unhappily to discharge a Pistol against the Ene¦mies, who already talked of sur¦rendring themselves, which was the reason that they discharged a∣gain upon him, and upon the Chief of the Great Alcander's Army, of which several were slain, and the Duke of Longueville among the rest, who was the cause of this misfortune. The News of it being carried to Paris, the Mareschaless almost died with grief▪ as well as many other Ladies, who had an interest in that young Prince's Person▪ he was also generally lamented by all Men, except Deffiat, who was there∣by rid of a powerful Enemy. In making an Inventory of his Papers, they found his last Will and Testa∣ments, which he had made a little before
his departure. All men were surprized to see, that in it he did knowledge the Son which he had the Mareschaless for his natu∣ral▪ Son, to whom he left five hundred thousand Livres, in case happened to dye before he were ried. This News being soon published through the whole Town, the Ma∣reschaless was advised of it by Ma∣ de Bertillac her good Friend, o at the same time, warned her  have a care, least it should reach her▪ Husbands Ears. The Mares∣chaless grew almost mad to see her iness becom thus publick; but  time brings comfort to every ng, she bore it the best in the World, and could at last hear it coursed of without blushing. the Great Alcander, knowing that the Duke of Longueville, had a Son by the Mareschaless, was very glad  it. For whereas there was a at resemblance between the
Duke of Longueville's advent and his own; I would say, where the Son, which the Duke left be¦hind him, was born of a Mar Woman, as well as those which the Great Alcander had by Mad de Montespan; he desired, that th should serve him for a precedent legitimate his own Children, when¦ever he should have a mind to  and he sent an Order to the Par¦liament of Paris, to legitimate the Duke of Longueville's Son, with¦out any obligation to name the Mother, which was however con¦trary to the Laws and Customs the Realm. When the first noise, which the News had made, was a little over the Mareschaless, who saw her Re¦putation lost amongst all People of Honour, resolved to cast off  the little continency she had le She tryed all those who were gl to be contented with the Duke Longueville's leavings, and wi
the leavings of several others, and ving tyed a strong Friendship with Madam de Bertillac, who was e of the fairest Creatures in all ris, they became each others Confident, and tasted all manner of Pleasures. The Mareschaless had a Foot man, who was since oak on the Wheel, and had one of the finest heads of Hair in the World, and detraction would have it, that he had a great share of her good Affections because it was observed, that she made some difference be∣tween him, and her other Foot∣men. Madam de Bertillac's great intima∣y with the Mareschaless, did not t all please Monsieur de Bertillac her Father in Law, who feared lest that whil'st his Son was in the Army, his Daughter in Law might be debauched; but that was a thing already done; for she had not been able to hear the Mareschaless discourse of the pleasure that there
was in playing a Husband fals without having a desire to t what it was. However Monsie de Bertillac held as strict a hand ¦ver her as she could, he had  Eye upon her, and often recom¦mended to her to have her ho¦nour before her Eyes. But he was to much employed vvith the keeping of the Great Alcanders Treasure vvhich that Prince had trusted to him, so that as it vvas difficu for him to be able to ansvver fo his Daughter in Laws conduc so it vvas easie for his Daughte in Lavv, to make him think vve of it. In the mean time, Madam d Bertillac, being one day gone t a play with the Mareschaless, vvher the last had seen le Basque th vaulter dance, she told the other that she fancied, that a Man vvho had such a supple back, vvas an admirable performer, and said, tha she had a great desire to make a
tryal of him her self. The Marescha∣less's Ingenuity having obliged Ma∣m de Bertillac to open also her art, she told her, that she really ieved, there would be a great al of pleasure in doing what she d, but that for her part, if she was curious of any thing, it was f knowing whether Baron the maedian, was as agreeable a Per∣n in Conversation, as he was up∣on the Stage. This confidence was llowed by the approbation of the Mareschaless; she exalted Baron's Merit, to the end that Madam de Bertillac might commend le Basque, and each encouraging the other to prove this Adventure other∣wise than in the Idea, they were o sooner gone from the Play, but they resolved to write to these two Men, to desire their Company for one moment. Baron and le Basque were very much surprized at the Honour that was done them, and having not
failed to give them a civil answe the enterview was at St. Clou, from whence the Ladies returned so w contented, that they agreed be¦tween themselves, that it should not be the last time that they would see them. They afterwards im¦parted to each other what had happened to them, and they went both obliged to confess unanimous¦ly, that it was not always men o Quality that rendred the ablest Ser¦vice. As for the men, each of them had not the same cause of contentment. If Baron were sa¦tisfied with his fortune, le Basq was unsatisfied with his; he found the Mareschaless insatiable; and he told Baron, that although he much wearied himself at the Play, yet he had rather be obliged to dance there all day, than be with her only one hour; Baron did comfort him with the good fortune he had in being in Favour with a Woman of great Quality, and he was fool enough
to feed himself with this Chimaera. In the mean time Madam de Bertillac gave her self over to that ravagance, that she could not  a moment without Baron, and having understood that he had lost very considerable sum at play, e forced him to take her Jewels, which were well worth twenty thousand Crowns. But it happe∣ned to her misfortune, that one of her Father in Laws Friends being  go to some publick Meeting, e prayed him to borrow them t her of his Daughter in Law, d Monsieur de Bertillac being very glad to oblige that Lady, bid Madam Bertillac lend them to her, which did extreamly perplex her. She having at first appeared sur∣prized, Madam de Bertillac did be∣lieve, seeing that she was a Gam∣r, she had played away or ed some part of them, and essing her to tell him where, to
the end that he might fetch them out, she confounded her self m and more, by saying, sometim that she had lent them one of her Friends, and sometimes that th were with a Jeweller, who h them to mend. Monsieur de Ber¦tillac, who was a man of Experi¦ence, plainly perceived that there was some Mystery in the matte but not being able to get any thing more out of her, he was forced to declare the business in his Daugh¦ter in Laws Family, who after se¦veral Stories, did at length con¦fess, that she had given them Ba¦ron; however she endeavoured t disguise it, under the name  lending them. Her Relations went immediately to the Player, who  first denyed the matter, believing that they spoke to him only o of suspicion, but understanding in a moment after, that Madam de Bertillac her self had been obliged to discover him, and that they had already
acquainted the Great Al∣cander with it, so that it would ove almost his ruine, he chose  restore them, and avoided there∣by a great deal of trouble. Monsieur de Bertillac believing, that his Son, who was in the Army, ould not fail being advised of what ad passed, bethought himself, that it was best for him, to give him otice of it himself, before any o∣ther; but Madam de Bertillac, who had a great power over her Hus∣bands Spirit, having prevented him by a Letter, Monsieur de Bertillac was very much surprized, when instead of thanks, as he expected from his Son, he received nothing but complaints, as if his Wife were ill in the right. Madam de Ber∣tillac carried her cunning yet far∣ther; she desired her Husband to suffer her to retire into a Convent, saying that she could no longer ve with Monsieur de Bertillac, who used her after such a manner,
as had he not been her Father Law, she should have believe that he had been amorous of  since he was become so Jealous▪ These News tormented her Hus¦band, who tenderly loved her, a was very far from believing  false, and attributing all the f to his Eather, the rest of the Cam¦pagne did seem to him to last thousand years, he was in so much hast to go and comfort this d Spouse. In the mean time he de¦sired his Father to leave his W in repose, of whose Virtue he w sufficiently persuaded, to believe none of all those Reports, which ran abroad to her disadvantage and as for her, he wrote to her  no means to go into a Conve unless she desired to make him d with Grief; to have patience un¦til the end of the Compagne, a after that he would put every thing in order. In effect, as soon as  returned, he would not hear a
thing to her prejudice; he lived with her as he was accustomed, and if she had not dyed in a little me after▪ she had gained so great n influence over him, that she ould have done whatever she had pleased, without any contradicti∣on from him. Madam de Bertillac's Death made the Mareschaless examine her self. She told some of her Friends that she would renounce all the Vani∣es of the World, but since she had said as much after the Duke of Longueville's Death, and yet had performed nothing of it, it was not believed that she would keep her word any better this time, than she did the other. In which one were deceived, for her Hus∣bands Death having set her at li∣berty, to live after her own Mode, e made an infinite number of Rascals, who were yet more un∣orthy, succeed le Basque. The Chevalier Grippefer kept her until
he was weary of her, to wh the Abbot of Lignerac succeed and as she gave him a part of  Bed, she obliged him to give  a share of his Purse. At last  Abbot of Lignerac, having qui the Mother in Law for the Daugh¦ter in Law, she is at this day ¦duced to give her self up to  little du Pré, who not only give her some of his Orvietan, but a teaches her all the tricks of Ca and of Cunning, wherewith the bubble together all new com and those, who are fools enough to expect fair play with a W man, who hath so long since a¦nounced all Honour and Hon¦sty. The Mareschaless's Example has moved the Dutchess de la Fer to be not more Virtuous. However she being younger, and, as she thought, fairer, she did not judg it proper to expose her self to a the World, as her Mother in Law did
but on the contrary, pre∣ming that she had Beauty enough  touch the Great Alcander's Sons art; she began not to make Court  him, but Love, and that so o∣nly, that the whole World could t look upon her Impudence, ithout blushing for her. The Mareschaless de la Motte her Mother, who had been Governant  the Great Alcanders Son, and who had Married another of her daughters to the Duke of Vanta∣r, of whose Conduct she was ready not too well satisfied, soon rceiving her Daughters designs, solved to stop the course of them, to preserve what was left of Repu∣tion in her Family. She there∣re told the Dutchess de la Ferte; ll that a Mothers Experience and Authority could dictate to her: ut all her Remonstrances did no other good, than to make her Daughter conceal from her, while e exposed to the Eyes of all o∣thers,
designes that made the l moderate murmur. For one d having found the Great Alcander Son in a good humour, she s very confident things to him, a the Prince having praised the B¦ty of her Hair, which was ind very fair, and of a beauteous Co¦lour, she told him, that if he h seen her Head undrest, he wou have been much better pleased with them, that when he pleased she would give him that satisfaction and stooping her Head at the same time, to shew him what quanti¦ty she had of them, she put her hand into a place, which decenc forbids me to name, while the young Prince considered only her head, possibly without mindin what she did. The Prince b¦ing then very young, the Dutch¦ess de la Ferte's action made hi more ashamed than it did her, and retreating back a step or two, his confusion encreased when he sa
that his Shirt hung out before, and at he must put it up again. The ush, which at the same time ap∣peared in his Face, with some o∣ther circumstances that were ob∣ved, made it conceived, that e Lady had not altogether lost her time while she stooped down; t she, not being the more out of ountenance for that, told the Prince, who was putting up his rt, that it was not very decent  do what he did before Ladies, d that if her Husband should ance to come by, it would be e∣nough to make him Jealous. The Prince gave her no leasure o pursue a discourse, the matter of which was disagreeable to him,  that after he went away, she ld two or three Ladies of her acquaintance, that she had seen a n who was no man, and they ot knowing what she meant by at, and yet desiring to know it, e told them, that she had been
just then to see the Great Alcan¦ders Son, who nevertheless co never be his Son. They prest  to explain the Riddle, which would not do, although they treated her; but these Ladies ¦ving understood the young Pri Adventure, did easily guess at rest, and it was not difficult to ¦lieve, but that the disorder, wh in he appeared, was the Dutch¦ess's own handy work. The Great Alcander, having be advised of it, told the Maresc¦less de la Motthe, that he was  at all satisfied with her Daugh¦ter, and he commanded her warn the Dutchess to have a m honourable Conduct; otherwise should be obliged to tell her Husband to look after it. In the me time, this Husband was a m vvho took no great care, either of his Wives Reputation, or of  ovvn, and provided that he might drink, and frequent Baudy-hou
valued not what men talk't of, r what might happen; he was stantly with a company of lewd ung Fellows, whose brave ex∣hibits did consist only in promo∣ting a Debauch, even to the last tremity. So that the Wenches, w bold or impudent soever they ere, never saw them enter their uses without trembling. About this time they did act a olick, that went a little too far, d that made a great deal of noise, h in the Court and Town; for er having spent the whole day with some Courtizans, where they had committed a thousand disorders, ey Supt at the three Spoons in Bear∣t; where being overtaken with Wine, they took up a Wafer▪ ma∣r, whose manly parts they cut , and put them in his Basket. This poor wretch seeing himself  the hands of these Executio∣ns, alarum'd not only the whole ouse, but even the whole Street
with his Cries and Lamentatio But although there came abo them many People, who would have dissuaded them from so  humane an Action, yet they would not give over, and the operati being finished, they sent away t unhappy Wafer-maker, who we to dye at his Masters House. This excess of debauchery, rather of madness, being known to the Great Alcander, he concei¦ved a dreadful anger at it. B the greater part of these despe men having Relation to the C of the Court, and even to the Mi¦nisters, he thought it proper, consideration of their Families, content himself with their Banish¦ment, and their Kindred found the Sentence so mild, in comparison what they deserved, that they re¦turned thanks to the Great Alcan¦der for it, seriously confessing, th so enormous a Crime did merit no¦thing less than Death.
The Marquis de Camardon and the Chevalier Gripesou, who had been concerned in the Debauch, and who were always the first to draw the others on, were a little mortified before their departure. For this last, who was the Son of the Famous Monsieur Gripesou, was entertained by his Father with a good Cud∣elling in the presence of a great many People; as he was a great Politician, he was very glad that it should be told the Great Alcan∣der, that he could not hear of so rrid an irregularity without give∣ing it some chastisement. As for the Marquis de Camardon, the Great Alcander said in discourse concern∣ing him, that he should not, during is life, ever pretend to be a Duke, and that he would always be more ready to give him marks of his disdain, than to do any thing for him, that might raise his Fortune. However we now see, that the Great Alcander has forgot his word, un∣less
it will be said, that it was no to the Marquis of Camardon th he hath lately granted the Dig¦nity of a Duke, but to Madamo¦selle de Laval, whom Camardo hath Married. The noise which this Frolic had made, being a little pacified the Kindred of those who were Banished, did solicit their return while the Dutchess de la Fer wisht that her Husband might no return so soon, having very good reasons for it, which I will relate in few words. When she percei∣ved that she in vain pretended to the Conquest of the Great Alcan∣ders Son, she fell to the first co∣mer, with whom she had no rea∣son at all to be contented. For some body made her a very bad present, and she having no expe∣rience in a certain ilness that in∣commoded her, took a resolution to go incognito to a Famous Chirur∣geons House to be better informed of
it. Being arrived there all alone  a Hackney Chair, which made m expect no great good from a Woman of her fashion, she decla∣red her business to him without y Ceremony, telling him, that some days since she felt some indis∣position, which made her fear that her Husband, who was something debauched, had not had that con∣sideration for her▪ which he ought o have had. Then she desired him to examine the matter, and to tell her his opinion, and at the same time shewing the Symptomes, she expected that the Chirurgion would at least shew himself piti∣ful in entring into her concern; but he, being accustomed to hear every day things cast upon the poor Husbands, whereof they for the most part were innocent, told her, that he was so wearied out with these kind of Stories, that he could no longer have any complai∣sance for those that told them, that
without giving her self farther trou¦ble in accusing her Husband,  should think only of putting h¦self into some speedy course of Cu because the Disease, which she ha might become worse, if she should chance to neglect it. That Declaration amazed the Dutchess, who had often heard her Husband speak of these kinds of Distempers, of which experienc had rendred him skilful, and being very desirous to know, if that, which she had, were the greatest of all she inquired it of the Chirurgion The Chirurgion answered, No  but that, as he had already told her, she must be speedily cured, or else it might become such. When she heard that, she told him, that she had so great a confidence in him, by reason of the Reputation which he had in the World, that she would put her self entirely into his hands; and at the same time naming her self, she surprized the
Chirurgion; who knowing that he had to do with a Person of the highest Quality, was troubled he had talked to her after the rate he had done. He asked her pardon for his having appeared so free in words, excusing himself, that since the greatest Prostitutes did frequently entertain him with the same Language, which she had used, he thought himself obliged to make her those answers that he did, he not having the honour to know her. The Dutchess easily pardoned him, nevertheless upon condition, that he should soon dispatch the business, which the Chirurgion pro∣mised her, if she would observe a certain rule of living. She told him, that she would do every thing that he should order her. And did even more; for she would keep her Bed while she took Physick, fearing, that if she had continued to live as she was accustomed to
do, watching might have heated her Blood, and rendred her Cure more difficult. In the mean time, though she had no mind to see any body▪ yet since it was very tiresome for her to be alone continually, she permitted Monsieur the Advocate, the Master of Requests, to come and Visit her, who had long since made love unto her without being able to obtain any favour. Monsieur the Advocate was a Jews Son, of the City of Paris, who after ha∣ving gotten an Estate of two Mil∣lions by his Usury, suffred himself to dye with cold, for fear of lay∣ing out a penny upon a Fggot. His Mother was also of the Jewish Race. Nevertheless, with all that, he was esteemed a man of Quali∣ty, and tho' he was of the long Robe, yet he never was pleased, but when he was in the Company of Sword men, to whom he ser∣ved for a Divertisement. He af∣fected
to appear a Huntsman, al∣though he understood not one term of the Profession, and if he ever hanced to discharge a Gun, which he very seldom did, he turned his head back, lest the Fire should seize his Hair. Moreover he was a great Talker and a great Lyer, but withal the best natured man in the World, offering every man his ser∣vice, but never serving any man. The Reputation which he had of being no dangerous man with the Women, to whom it was said, that he could do neither good nor harm, having made the Dutchess de la Ferte believe, that he would perceive less of the reason which kept her a bed, than any other, she lowed him to come and Visit her, nd he putting a great value upon t favour, returned her thanks pro∣portionable to his Wit. He protested  her, that after markes of so great distinction, he vvould live and dye t very humble Servant, and to
give her more essential Testimo¦nies of his Attachment, he swo to her, that neither her self or a of her Friends, should ever ha a Suit depending, before him, b right or wrong he would judge of their side, without ever e¦mining the Merits of the Caus it being enough for him to know that she had a concern in it. After a thousand other Prote¦stations of Service of the like na¦ture, he at length returned to the love, which he had so long ago ha for her, and endeavouring to make his Eyes agree with his Words, he turned them languishing upon her asking her, if she was resolved to be his death. The Dutchess de la Ferte told him, it was apparent that she had no such design, as h himself might easily judge; since she had sent for him, well remem∣bring, that he had several times told her, he could not live without see∣ing her. This answer made the Ad∣vocate
begin again his Comple∣ments, which would not have had n end, if she had not interrup∣ted them to ask him, how he ma∣naged Louison D'Arquien. He blusht t that Question, and the Dutchess, perceiving it, told him, that she e∣steemed men that had some Mo∣desty, that it was indeed true, that this Girl being a common Whore, it was not over creditable to visit her; but since that the Count de Saux, the Marquis de Camardon, the Duke de la Ferte himself, and even all the Court did the same, it could not be more disgraceful for him to Visit her, than it was for so many Persons of Quality, that, provided he did not enter∣tain her publickly, as was reported, there was no great harm in it; but for her part, she never would be∣lieve any such thing, having always thought him too discreet for that. Monsieur the Advocate, Master of Requests, having loudly affirmed
that it was a lye, and even would have affirmed, that he had neve seen her, if the Dutchess had no given him an opportunity to ex¦cuse himself, by turning the con¦versation as he had done. He therefore told her, that he had ne¦ver been with Louison D'Arquien but with Company, and thinking to say the finest things in the World, he swore to her, that wha Beauty soever those kind of Wo¦men had, he made a very grea difference between them, and a Person of her Merit; and at the same time endeavouring to give a description of her, he let her see, that though his Judgment was not very good, yet that he had a great Memory; for the Dutchess re∣membred, that she had some days since read in a Book of Gallantry, all those things which he at that time applied to her. In the mean time she was almost scandalized at the Comparison
ich he seemed to have made be∣tween her and Louison D'Arquien, r notwithstanding the difference which he alleged, she could not forbear being offended at it, and pro∣bably for that being conscious of the course of life which she her self ad, she took it as a private hint, which the Advocate would have iven her; but when she consi∣dered, that he was of no malici∣us Nature, and that these words had escaped him rather by chance, than out of any ill purpose, she ap∣peased her anger, and the conver∣sation ended without any sharp∣ness. On the morrow he returned to Visit the Dutchess, and found her very ill, she had that day taken strong Physick, and she very much complained of the pains which she suffered, attributing them to the Medicine, which she had taken, whereof there still remained about alf in a Glass upon the Table.
He took the Glass, and swallow the Medicine, saying, that he cou not endure to see the Person, who he loved best in the world, in pai while he himself was in perfe health. The Dutchess could not fo bear laughing at this extravaga¦cy, which the Master of Reque did however cry up, as a mark  the greatest love that ever was but afterwards reflecting, that th Physick might possibly hinder hi from going abroad on the mo¦row, and consequently that  would not be able to see the Dutch¦ess all that day, he fetcht suc sighs and groans as made the Dutch¦ess laugh, and put an end to th Comedy; for the Gripes having immediately taken him, he hard¦ly had time to get to his Coach and retire home. There being Mercury in the Me¦dicine, he was sufficiently tormen¦ted all that night, and all the next day,
and not being able to go to he Dutchesses, he writ to her a illet, of which I cannot give you he very words, they having ne∣er fallen into my hands; but ha∣ing heard it sufficiently talked of n the world, as of a very ridicu∣ous thing, I can relate the sense, which here follows. That he could not have the Ho∣r to see her all the day, because e was become like those common Women, who could not warrant them∣selves from acting lewdness with their Bodies, since they had got such  habit of it; that his own Body as so inured to certain things, which ▪ durst not name, that he must of necessity keep his Chamber, un∣l he was entirely recovered of his indisposition. In the mean time,  prayed her to believe, that he did not take the Physick as a Re∣edy against Love, but to shew her, that he should be amorous of her du∣ring his life.
The Dutchess read over and ¦ver again the Billet, with wond how a man, who was fifty yea old and upwards, and who ha seen so much of the world, coul be so great a Fool, and being ve¦ry glad to continue diverting he¦self with him, she was very imp¦tient to see him again. The Ad¦vocate, after having suffered, fo two days, all that could be suffered from that kind of Physick, came to tell her, that at length he was free (thanks be to God) from the ill∣ness that he had endured; tha he wished her health equal to tha which he enjoyed, and that if h knew, that the doing once more of that, which he had done, would advance her Cure, he was ready to devote himself to all manner of Torments for her love. The Dutchess thanked him for his good will, and told him, that, beginning to be a little better, she was in hopes her Disease would soon
leave her. That however as er Body recovered, her Mind grew ck; that she wanted two hun∣dred Pistols for an urgent occasion, and that not knowing where to get them, she could not take any rest her day or night. Though the Advocate was, as have said before, a Rich man's on; yet three things did contri∣bute to render him not much▪ at s ease. The first was, that his ther had left behind him a great any Children; the second was, hat his Jewish Mother, who pos∣st half the Estate, was still alive; and the other was, that he had pur∣hased an Office, which had cost him a great deal, but brought him  no large revenue. All this (I say) was the cause, that he was often put to his shifts for ready money. He could not at that very our offer the Dutchess the two hundred Pistols, which she had oc∣casion for, but he promised to bring
them to her on the morrow,  indeed he did not break his wo which was a thing very extra¦dinary for him. I cannot tell what use the Dutch¦ess had for this money, it being b¦yond my knowledge, but if I m be allowed to judge of it by th Circumstances that followed th Present, I will say, that it mu have been very great. For as soo as she saw the Advocate arrive wit a Purse, she embraced him wit all the appearances of a great te¦derness, and the Advocate being thereby provoked to things, whic surpassed, it seems, his natural forc endeavoured not to let slip an o¦casion, which was not every day presented to him, and against whic the Dutchess made no manner o resistance. In fine, whether the Dutches had forgotten the rule of living▪ which the Chirurgion had ordered her, or whether she imagined, that she
had between her Arms some dy more agreeable than the Ad∣cate, she accorded him the last vour for his money. As the Ad∣cate was not very importunate,  contented himself with one sin∣ Testimony of the Dutchesses mity, without desiring any more.  went home the most satisfied n in the world, and musing ly upon the Greatness, where∣to he was called, he became yet ore silly, and more vain than be∣re. In the mean time, being very reful of his health, and having rd it said, that excess of every ing was hurtful, he staid three or ur days without returning to the Dutchesses, at the end of which,  began to find himself unex∣ectedly ill. He could hardly be∣ve at first what he saw, but at gth knowing that the most in∣dulous had believed, when they d seen, he began to be convinced,
that he ailed something, and to the more assured of it, he had Council of Physitians, who told h that he was not deceived. In t mean time it cannot be said, wh¦ther this accident filled him mo with spight, or with joy. For  one side, if he thought that t Dutchess had done ill by him,  treating him so scurvily the fi time, on the other side he con¦dered, that she was still a Dutc¦ess, and Vanity having a gre power over him, he concluded wi himself, that the Favours of suc Persons, be they what they wi were never to be despised. H joyned also another consideratio to this reflection, to wit, that th accident being spread abroad in th world would re-establish his Re¦putation among all Women, wh having until then taken him for  Kinsman of the Marquis de Lang that is to say, for a man who mu have been divorced, if he had ha
Wise, would now be obliged to nfess themselves sometimes mi∣aken. It was for that reason also, that e had so publickly kept Louison 'Arquien, of whom the Dutchess ad upbraided him, as is above re∣ed; but they had no better o∣inion for all that of his perfor∣ance, and there was still want∣g this last circumstance to unde∣eive all the World. Instead there∣re of concealing himself, as ano∣er would have done, he went pub∣ckly into a course of Physick, and is intimate acquaintance doubting is Disease, he confirmed them in eir suspicion, and made a Gal∣try of it, as any vain young llow would have done. In the mean time this circum∣nce, which he believed so ad∣antageous to his Reputation, s more hurtful to his Fortune  he was a war. For being ei∣r ill ordered in the beginning,
or perhaps being of a temper diff¦cult to be cured, he was oblig to undergo a Flux. Moreove the Great Alcander, having hear of his disorder, lost the little estee he might have had of him, an denyed him the Office of May of the City of Paris, which he w inclined to give him upon the  commendation of Monsieur de P pone his Brother in Law, who w one of his Ministers. Monsieur the Advocates adve¦ture, which all the world fail not to impute to the Dutchess  la Ferte, gave the Mareschale de la Motte her Mother very gre vexation; neither was she bett contented with the Dutchess Vantadour, who accused her Hu¦band of having given her a Cla but who under the pretence, th he was debauched, gave her s up entirely to Monsieur de Til¦det, Monsieur de Louvoy's Con German. The Duke of Vantad
was a little man, very false and dissembling, yet wanted no Cou∣age. He, having had some hint f his Wives Intrigue, resolved to o watch her so narrowly, as to ake her in the Fact. For this pur∣pose he permitted her to make a ourney with the Dutchess D'Au∣nt his Sister, reasonably gues∣ing, that if there were any truth  what was told him, the Gallant ould not fail to meet her upon er way. In the mean time he took orse to observe their motions, nd arrived every Evening incog∣o in the same Inn, where his Wife lodged. He had not held this ourse above five or six dayes, when  saw Monsieur de Tilladet ar∣ive Post, who was in such hast  see Madam de Vantadour, that  did not give himself time so uch as to take off his Boots, or en to brush off the dust. He etended to the Duke D'Aumont, at he was also upon a Journey,
and that chance had brought him into the Inn. But the Duke o Vantadour, who knew very well what to think of it, not giving them leisure to enter into a long conversation, went up staiers im∣mediately with his Sword in hand and he surprized the whole Com¦pany, who little dream't of him and thought that he had been fa enough off from thence. The Duke D'Aumont, who a his first Marriage, had taken t Wife Monsieur de Louvoy's Sister Monsieur Tilladets Cousin German took his part against the Duke o Vantadour his Brother in Law alledging for a reason, that th Duke had so little consideratio for him, as to come even to b Chamber, to assault a man, wh had never given him any cause  be his Enemy; so with the he of his Servants, he prevented a mischief, and having understoo that there was jealousie in t
case, he advised the Dutchess of Vantadour, to beware going with her Husband, who would carry her away by force, which advice she punctually followed. Madam de Vantadour's denyal put her Husband into an absolute fu∣y, and he being very quarrelsome, challenged the Duke D'Aumont to fight, and gave him mighty a∣busive Language; but the Duke D'Aumont did not think himself obliged to take any notice of it, because it proceeded from a man, who had no great esteem in the world. In the mean time, the Duke of Vantadour having been forced to depart without his Wife, complain∣ed to the Great Alcander, that the Duke D'Aumont had kept her from him, the Greatest men of the Court concerned themselves in this quar∣rel, and the Prince of Conde, who was the Duke of Vantadour's Kins∣mad, said very bitter things to the
Mareschaless de la Motte, who, pre¦tending to excuse her Daughter an the Duke D'Aumont, endeavoure to dishonour the Duke of Vanta¦dour. The Great Alcander did for¦bid fighting on either side, and ha¦ving taken cognisance of the bu¦siness, he layed all the blame up¦on the Duke, and he permitted his Wife either to return to him or to retire into a Religious House▪ as it should seem good unto her. Neither of these two conditi¦ons did very well please the Dutch¦ess, who had rather have had a third, had it been in her choise, which was to remain with the Dutchess D'Aumont her Sister, where she might have every day seen Monsieur de Tilladet; but the Great Alcander having pronoun∣ced the Sentence, it was her part to submit to his Judgment, which she did, by retiring into a small Convent in the Suburb of St. Mar∣eau. Monsieur de Tilladet saw
her there twice or thrice incogni∣o, by the Superiours consent. In a little time after, the Exiles, whom I have some while since mentioned, returned to Court, and were obliged to behave themselves more discreetly. The Duke de la Ferte found his Wife recovered, but the Advocate's Cure was not yet perfected, and although he at first comforted himself with the hopes of having (as I have already said) a better Reputation; yet it cost him so dear, that he heartily wisht, he had long ago renounced all the Vanities of the world, and left the filth wherein he wallowed. At length his Chirurgion having finish∣ed the Cure, he soon forgot the sickness he had ailed, and having heard the business of the Duke D'Aumont and the Duke of Van∣tadour talk't of, and his way being to procure reconciliations, he told them both, that he was very much troubled at his not having been
in health at that time, otherwis he would have rendred them tha Service. In the mean time he having th colour of one already dead, every body asked him, if he were no returned out of the other world he was at first much perplexed t give it an answer, but being a length hardned to these kind  questions, he himself would begi laughing at them with the others which put an end to all the rai¦lery that was made about him. On day the Dutchess de la Ferte ha¦ing a mind to be pleasant upon him he being naturally very brutish, answered her—Zwouns, Madam, it ill becomes you to laugh at that condition, which you your self did put me in, believe me, this was the first, and shall be the last time while I live, that I will have to do with you, and though I have kept Company with Louyson D'Ar∣quien a whole year, which I now
will freely confess unto you: I never have had the least reason to complain of her, when as I have been with you hardly a minute, and yet I shall have reason to re∣pent of it, during my whole life. The Dutchess could not suffer these reproaches from the Advo∣cate without entring into a dread∣ful passion. She took up the Tongs, and struck him with it with all her strength, and making ill Language succeed her blows, she said, that things were come to a fine pass indeed, when a pitiful Citizen, such as he was, durst presume to make himself so familiar with a Woman of her Quality, that, allowing what he had said to be true, yet the Honour was too great for him. She bid him get out of her House, o∣therwise she would make him leap out at the Windows, and she pusht him towards the Door with the end of the Tongs. Monsieur the Advocate, who saw that there was
no jesting with her, threw himsel at her Feet, and begged her par¦don, he owned that he had wrong¦ed her, but to excuse himself, h said, that it was out of impatience to see her insult over him, imagin¦ing that she did it only out of con¦tempt, that that was the reason of his complaints, though indeed there was no fault to be found with her niceness, and that if she had been present at his torments she should have seen him endure them with so great a Resignation that she would have confest him to have been a true Martyr o Love. All these reasons did not soften the Dutchesses Spirit, which was haughty and disdainful; and ha∣ving made him depart her Cham∣ber, she forbid him ever to come again into her sight, unless he would expose himself to a much more rude entertainment. The Advo∣cate went away with a very heavy heart,
fetching deep sighs, and ha∣ing a very great mind to cry, but being to pass the Court of de la Ferte's House, which is very arge, and fearing to meet some body, he kept back his tears until he was in his Coach. As soon as he was in it, there came one of the Mareschal de la Ferte's People, to tell him, that his Master would speak with him before he went away, which cau∣sed him to endeavour still to re∣strain them, and after having ad∣justed his Perruque and his Band, which were in a little disorder, he went up into the Mareschal's Ap∣partment, where he found a very handsome Lady with some Gen∣tlemen, who were all there for a quarrel which they had together. The Mareschal told him that he had given him the trouble of coming up, to see if there were any means to compound a difference between these People, without obliging them
to come before a general Assem¦bly of the Mareschals of France, and there being already some proceed¦ings had on either side, and those regarding him (for the Great Al¦cander had granted the hearing o all things of this nature to the Ad¦vocate) he would be glad to know his opinion of it. Monsieur the Advocate asked, what the matter was, and the Ma∣reschal having told him that he must needs have seen the Infor∣mations, the Master of Requests answered, that his Secretary had not yet laid them before him, which served for a good excuse. The Mareschal knowing that it was an establisht Custom with him, to let his Secretary do all the business, told him, that the Lady, whom he saw there before him, complained, that a Gentleman who was also there present, had dishonoured her by scandalous Stories▪ for which she demanded satisfaction; that
though there were no Witnesses, yet the thing was a verred by the Gentle∣mans own confession, who main∣tained, that, far from having inju∣red the Lady, he was very much in the right; that to justifie that, he reported, how that he had passio∣nately loved her, and had sought after all opportunities of serving her; that he had rendred her so consi∣deable a service as to furnish her at one time with 200 Pistols, but that in recompence she had given him nothing but a Disease, which had kept him three entire Months in his Bed; that he, believing he had reason to complain of it, had publisht, that this Lady was not cruel, but yet that he would have no more of her Favours at that price. Monsieur the Advocate hearing a Story that had so great a rela∣tion with his own, believed that his Intrigue was discovered, and that some body must have heark∣ened
at the Dutchesses Door; be∣ing therefore quite out of coun∣tenance, he blusht and grew pale again, and wrapping himself up in his Cloak, he told the Mareschal that he jeered him, and took his way towards the Door, without saying any thing more. The Ma∣reschal, who was in his Bed, not being able to run after him, cal∣led him back; but seeing that he would not return, he command∣ed the Captain of his Guards, not to suffer him to go away so, be∣cause he had need of him to com∣pound that business. Monsieur the Advocate made a difficulty of turn∣ing back, telling the Captain that Monsieur the Mareschal only rallied with him: But the Captain ha∣ving told him, that there was no jesting in the case, and that what the Mareschal did, was because he desired to do those Persons service; he re-entred the Chamber, and the Mareschal asked him since when
he had given over making com∣position between Gentlemen, a re∣proach which he made him, be∣cause he knew, that under pre∣tence of such business, he neglected other Affairs which did appertain to the Duty of the Office, which he had in the Great Alcanders Council. After that Monsieur the Advo∣cate had excused himself as well as he could, they began to handle the matter in question, and with∣out waiting for a deduction of all the Particulars, he decreed, that the Gentleman should be sent to Prison, from whence he should not be set free, until he had asked the Ladie's pardon, who to thank him for his favourable Decree, made him a very low reverence. The Advocates Sentence was punctual∣ly followed by the Mareschal, and the Gentleman was sent into Pri∣son. In the mean time Monsieur the Advocate being retired home,
he called for Pen, Ink and Paper and writ a Billet to the Dutche de la Ferte, whereof here is a Co¦py. The Advocates Letter to the Dutchess de la Ferte. I Could not make you a greater sa¦tisfaction for my fault, than that which I have done in going from your Chamber. A Gentleman, who had the same quarrel with a Lady as I have with you, hath been sent to Prison, and besides I have con∣demned him to recant all that he hath-said, though possibly he might have told nothing but the truth, as well as my self. If the same re∣paration may satisfie you; Order me only into what Prison you will have me go, and, I will punctually obey you, having resolved to be for my life your Prisoner of Love.
The Dutchess de la Ferte found he Advocates Character in this Letter, which was, to say the sil∣iest things in the world, when e thought to say the finest. She had a mind to make him a very sharp answer, but judging that it would argue more of resentment, than of disdain, she continued si∣lent, which did extreamly afflict Monsieur the Advocate. Who be∣sides the pleasure which he took in being great with a Dutchess, saw himself thereby deprived of dining with her, which was very commodious for him, and which he often did, he himself being no Hous-keeper, and the Dutchess lodging near him. At length see∣ing that his disgrace did still con∣tinue, he addicted himself entire∣ly to the Duke of Vantadour, whom he advised to be reconciled to his Wife. He was the secret Media∣tor of the Reconciliation, and find∣ing there, what he had lost in the
other place, that is to say, as muc quality at least as with the Dutche de la Ferte, a fine Woman, and good Table, he stuck close to th Table, and endeavoured to gai the Woman, who, being more re¦served in her Pleasures than her Si¦ster, did reject the Advocate, the ver first time he would have spoken t her, in such a manner that he du not expose himself to a second denial▪ In the mean time the Duke and the Dutchess de la Ferte▪ held o the same course of life as they had begun. The Dutchess had th Abbot of Lignerac for a Gallant and his money was to him instead of merit. As for the Duke, h stoptat nothing, and being a ma that neither minded or esteemed perfect love, he found Mistresses as often, and as many as he plea∣sed, in the publick places, and his passion being soon satisfied, he did frequently beat them, after having embraced them, and thus he made blows
succeed his Caresses, as some∣mes his Embraces succeeded lows. One day that he made a ebauch in one of those places with he Duke▪ de Foix, Camardon, and ome others, Camardon told him, hat he wondred, that he who lo∣ed to relish Pleasures in their pure ature, had not once caused his Wife to come and lye with him sometimes, at Louyson D'Arquin's,  at Madelon du Pre's, that he would have found there a thousand times more satisfaction than at home, and hat if he would make a tryal of it, e would without doubt be of the same opinion. Though the Duke de la Ferte was not over curious upon his Wives score; yet he found fault with what Camardon had said, of bring∣ing her into a place of Debauche∣ry, and the Duke of Foix, who was Camardon's Brother in Law, ap∣proved of what Monsieur de la Fer∣te said, adding, that the Dutchess
de la Ferte was not a Woman come into those kind of places. C¦mardon answered him, that she w one that might come thither well as any other, as also his Wi who was yet more scrupulous th the Dutchess de la Ferte. Th if they would only lay a Wag with him of an hundred Pistol he would undertake to bring the both thither, when he pleased, a being earnest in affirming the mat¦ter, he made the whole Comp¦ny laugh, who knew him to b man infinitely agreeable, and of  excellent Wit. He in the mean ti retracted nothing from what I had proposed, but framing a res¦lution of letting them see the e¦fect of what he told them, he de¦trously changed the discourse, that there was no farther reflect on made upon what he had said Within five or six days after¦wards, Camardon was to visit h Sister the Dutchess de Foix, an
told her that he had made a match ith the Dutchess de la Ferte to  into St. Germains Fair, and that  she would go along, he would rry them both thither some morn∣ng; but that she must not tell her Husband of it; that the Dutchess e la Ferte would also conceal it om hers, and that there were cer∣ain reasons, why they should know nothing of it, until they were ar∣ived in the Fair. The Dutchess e Foix assented to it without in∣forming her self farther of those reasons. The Match being made, nd the day appointed to be the morrow, he then took her in his Coach, and went to fetch the Dutch∣ess de la Ferte, to whom he had said as much. As they were upon the way, some part of the Coach broak all on the suddain, and the two La∣dies being frightned with the dan∣ger of being over-turned, cryed out to the Coach-man to hold,
who immediately obeyed the All this was but a trick designe by Camardon, in order to make demonstration to their Husband that he had told them nothing b what he was sure of performing In the mean time having helped out the Ladies, he very hastil asked his Coach-man, what wa the matter, and quarrelled wit him very much in appearance, be∣cause he had not seen whether the Coach was in order, before his coming▪ out. Then he told the Ladies that there was no stay∣ing for them in the Street, that he was well acquainted with a Citizen hard by, to whose house they had best go, and repose them∣selves, while the Coach was re∣fitting. These Ladies, having no other choice to make, willingly assented to it, and being come to a house they were there received by a Wo∣man, who shew'd them a great deal of
Civility. She brought them in∣ a very handsome Chamber, and tertained them very well, while mardon was in another Room writing two Notes to the Duke  Foix, and de la Ferte, by which e desired them to come speedily  him at Madelon du Pre's, which as the very place whither he d brought their Wives. The Dukes de Foix, and de  Ferte, having received these otes, hastened to the place ap∣ointed. Camardon ran to meet em, and desired them not to be oubled at the pains that they had ken; that he would shew them o of the finest Women in Town, hom du Pre had lately discove∣ed; and immediately opening to em the Chamber Door, wherein e Dutchesses de la Ferte and de ix were, he presented the Ladies  them, desiring them both to use em so well, as not to let them o away in discontent. 'Tis easie
to judge of the astomishment th these two Dukes were in, but th of the Dutchesses was much greate who knowing where they were had a mind to be seriously angr with Camardn: But he rallyin them all four, obliged them to laug at it along with him, and havin bespoke a Dinner, they all fi dined together in that honest plac though the Women made a shew as if they would not stay there an longer. Nevertheless when they percei¦ed, that it was their Husband pleasure, they were persuaded t stay; and to pass away the time while they expected Dinner, they desired du Pre to give them a figh of her Nuns; which she did, be¦cause, imagining that they wer all of the same Sisterhood, she woul not disoblige those, who well de¦served to be Abbesses of the Con¦vent.
In the mean time, the Advo∣ates disgrace still continued; but misfortune having at that time appened to the Chevalier de Lig∣erac (the Abbot de Lignerac's Bro∣her) who had been sent into Pri∣on at the request of an infinite num∣er of People, whom he had cheat∣d, the Dutchess de la Ferte sent o enquire for him, and told him, hat she would pardon him, pro∣ided he could get the Chevalier e Lignerac out of Prison. Mon∣eur the Advocate, who knew of he Intrigue between the Abbot nd her self, thought it very hard, hat he must be employed for his ivals Brother, and that his Pardon ould be obtained at no other Price: ut she having heretofore punish∣d him for telling truth, he durst ot then gain-say her, and he pro∣ised her, that if the Chevalier de ignerac were not freed from his mprisonment, it should not be or want of his employing all his redit in order to it.
Monsieur the Advocate found  obstacle in his undertakings,  the Chevalier de Lignerac's C¦tors were perpetually crying in t Judges Ears, and having made appear that he had once alread Mortgaged his Estate, and that  afterwards had borrowed two hund¦red thousand Crowns upon it,  Judges let Monsieur the Advo¦cate know, that it was impossib for them to set him free, and th was all the accompt he could gi the Dutchess. He very much apprehended, th she would not be satisfied with th denial; but the Dutchess who lo¦ved a multitude, and who w sometimes vexed for not seeing him told him, that she was obliged  the pains which he had take and that he might return to h House, as often as he had a min to it. Monsieur the Advocate thre himself at her Feet to thank he He embraced her Knees, and pr¦testing
to her an eternal fidelity, e told her, that her Sister the Dutchess of Vantadour, had not alf her Merit; that should he live  thousand years, he would not e able to love her one quarter  an hour; that she would cer∣ainly say, that he had no great Wit, because he never could speak ne single word to her, but he did ot care what Reputation he had with her; provided she would con∣ider, that so great an indifference or so amiable a Person, could not proceed but from the love which e had for her. As he ended these words, one of the Dutchess of Vantadour's Foot∣men came in, and having presen∣ed her with a Note from her ister, she took it and read what ollows.
The Dutchess of Vantadour's Le¦ter to the Dutchess de la Ferte. ONE of my very good Frien hath a bness depending b¦fore Monsieur the Advocate, and  believes it so delicate, that he e¦deavours to get it recommended  him, by all those who have any Cr¦dit with him: If I had foreseen th accident, I should willingly ha harkened to a great deal of No¦sense, which he would have said  to me; but not having the gift  Divination, and besides, loathing  sottish a conversation, I desired hi something roughly not to continue  any longer. This makes me believ that he has no great good will for me I have therefore recourse to yo intercession to recommend my Frien business to him, which I pray y to do, as you would your own, an you will oblige a Sister, who is entire¦ly Yours.
The Dutchess de la Ferte, to whom Monsieur the Advocate had ost then protested, that he could ever express the least love to the Dutchess of Vantadour, seeing the ontrary in this Letter, had more han once a desire of shewing it o him, to divert her self; but earing least it might be a preju∣ice to the Gentleman, whom her Sister recommended, she put the Letter into her Pocket, and sent way the Footman, whom she com∣anded to tell her Sister, that she would do what she desired. The footman being gone, Monsieur he Advocate, who was the most urious man in the world, would in have known what the Letter ontained, and not being satisfied with what the Dutchess told him, who endeavoured to put the change upon him, he took an opportu∣nity to put his hand into her Pocket, d having snatched it thence, he told her, that he vvould imme∣diately
see all their secrets. The Dutchess, who for the ¦bove mentioned reasons wou gladly have prevented him fr seeing it, endeavoured to tear from him, but not having bee able to do it, she told him, th he would extreamly disoblige he unless he would restore the Lette that very moment. But Monsie the Advocate believing that th more she endeavoured to have  again, it was of the greater con¦sequence, withdrew a little asid to read it. The Dutchess was n able to hinder him, and he wa excessively surprized, to find therei such unexpected matters. Then he told the Dutchess, tha Madam de Vantadour said what wa not true, that he had never spoke to her of any thing, and that t let her see, that he never had any esteem for her, he would cause he Friend to lose his business. Th Dutchess de la Ferte told him, tha
he must not do it for her sake; at it was no longer her Sisters siness, but her own, that there∣re it was not with the Dutch∣ss of Vantadour, that he was a∣out to quarrel, but with the utchess de la Ferte. Madam de  Ferte found much difficulty to ain this point upon him, but ha∣ing told him, that she did not be∣eve any thing of what Madam e Vantadour had writ unto her, ho had a fault common to all e Women, to wit, to take the east glance for a declaration of ove, she thereby gave him occa∣ion to justifie himself to her. Mo∣sieur the Advocate alledging. that he Dutchess of Vantadour must then ave interpreted to her own ad∣vantage some innocent regards, the Dutchess endeavoured to con∣firm him more and more in that opinion, and so insensibly brought him again into a good humour, and he afterwards promised to do
all, for the Gentleman, that sh could desire. While all this past, Madam too a Maid of Honour, whose Beaut created desires in all the Cou¦tiers, and Jealousie in all her Co¦panions. She was of a most ra¦vishing shape, so that detractic that is used to catch at every thing was here at a loss, all confessing that they had never seen any thing so accomplisht, as this amiable Pe¦son. The Great Alcander, who  that time loved Madam de Mo¦tespan rather out of an habit, tha out of passion, had no sooner see her, but he was charmed with he But he being unwilling to ma love any more like a young ma but like a great King, employe a third Person to discourse it wit her; and to the end that his pro¦fers of Service might be the be¦ter received, he accompanied ther with a Pearl Necklace, and a pa of Diamond Pendants of great v¦lue.
In the mean time Madam de Montespan was in a mortal fear, lest this young Beauty should rob her of the Prince's Heart, with whom she had very lately had a filling out some few days before. For pretending that he ought to treat her still as he had done in the beginning, the taxed him for ha∣ving no greater complaisance for her, and because the Great Alcan∣der made answer, that they had been too long acquainted to ob∣serve so much Ceremony, she was so transported with passion, as to say very disobliging things unto him. She began with reproaching him of all that she had done for him; that she had forsaken her House, her Children, her Husband, and even her Honour for him; that there was no manner of Complai∣sance that she did not continually express to engage him; but that he was of late become very cold and indifferent; that if years had
brought upon her any imperfecti∣ons, he ought not to attribute them to her, but to time, that destroys all things; however that she did not yet perceive (thanks be to God) that there was so great an altera∣tion in her Person; but that for him she could say, nevertheless without having any design to an∣ger him, that though he had great cause to be thankful to nature, yet that he was not exempted of all manner of faults; that he had one great one among the rest, which he perhaps never perceived; but that she had been very sensible of it, without ever making any com∣plaint, because she believed that none ought to take such particular notice of those they loved. The Great Alcander, whom no body durst ever upbraid before, was extreamly moved to hear Ma∣dam de Montespan say these things, for whom he had done no less than she had done for him; for if she had
forsaken her House, Children, and Husband to stick to him, he had abandoned for her the care of his Reputation, which was very much blemisht, for having loved a Wo∣mn, who had so great reasons to be more discreet. However, since we are more sensible of the inju∣ries which we receive from those that we love, than we are of those which we receive from Persons in∣different to us, he suffered not this reproach to fall thus to the ground, but demanding of Madam de Mon∣tespan, what his faults then were, he provoked her to declare them, by informing her of her own; at which Madam de Montespan was so concerned, that she replied unto him, that if she had those imper∣fections whereof he did accuse her, yet that she had not in the least any offensive smels about her. This being as much as to say, that the Great Alcander was not without them, it is impossible to
express how ill he took this re∣proach. He told Madam de Mon∣tespan such things, as were enough to have touched her home, and to have made her recollect her self if she had any sense of Virtue yet remaining. But having entirely given her self over to her passions, she was no more moderate in the answer, which she gave him, than she had been in the beginning of this Conversation. While they quarrelled thus ve∣hemently with each other, the Prince de Marsilliac came to the Closet Door wherein they were, and the Great Alcander having given him power to enter any where, with∣out demanding leave, he had his Foot already within the Door, when he understood by the sound of the Prince's voice, that he was in anger; this made him stop short, and being desirous to know, whe∣ther he might enter, he began to call out aloud Doorkeeper, Doorkeeper;
and there being none in the way, he called out louder yet, who is here, that will give me an answer. The Great Alcander, who gave ear to e∣very thing that he said, truly gues∣ed, after having given him such per∣mission, that he did so out of dis∣cretion, and being glad to have an opportunity to break up so disa∣greeable a conversation, he told the Prince of Marsilliac, that he might come in; which was the reason that Madam de Montespan endeavoured to constrain her self, for fear that the report of her disgrace, which she was willing to conceal, should spread over the whole Court. She departed in a moment after∣wards, and left the Great Alcander at liberty to open his heart to the Prince of Marsilliac, who had a great share of his confidence, and to whom he had given in less than one year, above one hundred thou∣sand Livres in places, for imme∣diately after Monsieur de Lausun's
disgrace he forced him to take the Government of Berry, which that Favourite had possest, and which he was unwilling to accept of, be∣cause, having never been his Friend, he was afraid, least the world should say, that he had provoked the Great Alcander to cause him to be impri∣soned, in order to benefit himself of his spoils. The Great Alcander looked upon this delicacy to be so much the more excellent, as it was rare amongst Courtiers, and since it could pro∣ceed only from a great heart, he had yet a greater esteem for him. Some∣time after he again gave him the place of great Master of the Ward∣robe, void by the Death of the Mar∣quis de Saintry, who was killed at the passage of the Rhine, but he gave it him after so obliging a man∣ner, that the Present was less con∣siderable for its greatness alone, than for the goodness which the Great Alcander exprest towards him, when
he made it. For he told him, that he gave him that place only to ac∣commodate his Affairs, and not to ncommode them; that if it were more profitable for him to sell it, than to keep it, he himself would find out a Chapman, and make him give a Million for it. Thus the Great Alcander still con∣tinued to give marks of his amity to the Prince of Marsilliac, and the other Courtiers looked upon him as a kind of Favourite, but also as one much more worthy to possess that place, than Monsieur de Lau∣sun, who despised all the world, as if there had been no man worthy to approach him. In the mean time this Favour, which failed not to create a jealousie in all the rest, en∣creased yet the more, by reason of the cold indifferency, wherein the Great Alcander was fallen for Ma∣dam de Montespan, and of the new passion, which he resented for Ma∣dam de Fontanges, who was that
Maid of Honour to Madam, th I have before mentioned. For th Great Alcander having communi¦cated both the one and the other t the Prince of Marsilliac, he w willing that he should be the ma¦nager of that Maiden's good Graces in which he was likely to find n great difficulty, she being come t Court with a design only to pleas the Great Alcander. In effect, her Kindred seeing he so fair and well shaped, and having a greater passion for their own For∣tune, than care for her Honour, they made a Purse among them∣selves to enable her to come to Court, and to maintain there an ex∣pence honourable and conformable to the Post, wherein she was entred, and they having given her proper instructions, she put them in pra∣ctice from the very moment that the Prince of Marsilliac had spoken to her in the Great Alcanders be∣half. She therefore told him, that
she received with joy the Decla∣ration which he just then had made unto her: That the Great Alcan∣der had such charming Qualities to make himself be beloved, that she must of necessity be very ill∣humoured not to be charmed with his passion: But that however, she could place no great confi∣dence in it, as long as Madam de Montespan possest his Favour as she did; that she was nice, and could not believe any thing of what she had then heard out of his mouth; that if she had been capable of kindling any fires in his heart, they were only fires that would be al∣most as soon quenched as they were kindled, for the Great Alcander would no sooner have satisfied his desire, but he would return to Ma∣dam de Montespan. The Prince of Marsilliac, who desired to succeed the first time in his Embassy, replyed to that, that if the future may be guest at
by things, that are passed, there was no great appearance, that the Great Alcander, who was displea∣sed with Madam de Montespan, would ever return to her; that he was constant when he once gave himself up to any one, and that if he had forsaken Madam de la Va∣liere, it was, because she her self had contributed very much unto it, by an unequality of Spirit, that did not please the Prince. That she might have heard, how that Madam de la Valiere before her en∣tring into a Convent for good and all, had gone into one contrary to the Great Alcanders pleasure, who was obliged to fetch her out, af∣ter which time she did nothing but discourse to him of the remorse of her Conscience, which by lit∣tle and little weaned him from her, the Great Alcander being unwil∣ling to oppose her Salvation: That then he loved Madam de Montes∣pan, and would it may be have
loved her still, if she had not be∣haved her self towards him after a manner, that might possibly have befitted a private mans Mistress, but not the Mistress of so power▪ a Prince, as was the Great Alcan∣der, towards whom she ought to have shewn a more submissive and complaisant humour; that he would instruct her how to carry her self, as occasion should require, but that for the present, she need only tell him something that might set the King's mind at rest. Then he advised her as a good Friend not to let slip so fair an opportunity, saying, that if she lost it through her own fault, she would repent of it for all her life. Then he related to her the quar∣rel that the Great Alcander had had with Madam de Montespan, that La∣die's Insolence, and the King's Re∣sentment. This last Circumstance having convinced her more than all his reasons, she sent the Great
Alcander word, that if she had been obliged to him for the Pre¦sent which he had made, and which I have already mentioned, she was much more so, for what he had ordered the Prince of Marsilliac to tell her, and that she was ready to give her self up to him, pro∣vided she might have him entire∣ly to her self. In the mean time Madam de Montespan, who mistrusted this In∣trigue, employed all her Friends, in order to regain the Great Alcan∣der's confidence. Monsieur de Louvoy, who was one of them, and even the most affectionate among them, advised her to seek out an oppor∣tunity of speaking with him in private. But the Great Alcander retaining still his anger, and care∣fully avoiding all occasions of being alone with her, it was hard for her to find such an opportunity; until Monsieur de Louvoy told her, to be at a convenient hour in the place, where
the Great Alcander was ac∣ustomed to meet his Council, and otake her time when he was come hither, o reconcile her self with im. Madam de Montespan, having ap∣proved of this advice, failed not o be at the designed place. The Great Alcander being come thither, was very much surprized to meet her there, instead of the Ministers. In the mean time Monsieur de Lou∣voy, who was willing to give Ma∣dam de Montespan time to do her business, went into a Room ad∣ning to the Chamber where they then were, and seeing there seven or eight Gentlemen of the Court, who were used to come thither to shew themselves, when the Great Alcander went either in or out, he took a Candle off of a Stand, pretending to search for a Diamond, which he said he had lost, rightly guessing, that some of the Servants belonging to the
Chamber would come to assist him in his search, and one being come to that purpose, he softly whisper∣ed him, as he gave him the light that he should cause all those, who were in the Room to depart, and that he should tell the Doorkeeper not to let any body enter, no no even those, who were summoned to the Council. Thus without its being per∣ceived that it proceeded from him, he rid himself of all the importu∣nate; and instead of a Council there was held that day a long Conference between the Great Al∣cander, and Madam de Montespan In the mean time, all knowing that Monsieur de Louvoy staid in the Chamber, they believed him to be shut up with the Prince, and the other Ministers, who were sent back without being suffered to enter grew jealous of it, not knowing to what to attribute this long con∣versation, which occasioned that
there was no Council held that day, which never happened before, the Great Alcander being usually very punctual in all his actions. Though this Conference seemed to have re accommodated all mat∣ters, the Great Alcander returning according to his custom to Madam de Montespan's Lodgings, yet the Prince ceased not to pursue his A∣morous enterprise. He saw Madam de Fontange in private, he gave her markes of affection, and received the same from her, which could not be so secret, but that it was soon known to the whole Court. The Great Alcander was so well satisfied with this new Conquest, that he gave the Prince of Marsilliac, the place of Chief Hunts man, for a reward of his having procured  for him. In the mean time the Great Alcander, who had the luck to find fruitful Mistresses, having understood that Madam de Fon∣tange was big with Child, he pre∣pared
a House for her; and this La∣dy, being much unlike Madam d Montespan, whose avarice reacht e¦ven to baseness, was generous even to prodigality; he therefore gave her a man to restrain this liberal humour; and to take care that she might subsist upon an hundred thou∣sand Crowns a Month, which he gave her. This Superintendant was the Duke of Nouallies, at which every body was extreamly surprized, his Devotion seeming incompatible with an Employment that made him look into several little reckonings which he might have well past o¦ver: But since every one was resolved to think in the first place on their own Fortune, and in the second place up∣on God. The Duke of Nouallies, very far from refusing this Employment, gave the Great Alcander thanks for having bestowed it upon him before many other Pretenders, and divided his time between the Great Alcan∣der, Heaven, and Madam de Fon∣tanges.
In the mean time, Madam de Montespan endeavoured to support er self the best she could. She en∣eated the Great Alcander, to be eased to come at least to her odgings as he was used to do, nd she endeavoured to insinuate o all the world, that her Credit as yet greater than was imagined; hat the Great Alcander's love for Madam de Fontanges was only a ansitory love, of which he would on be weary; and that at last, e would return to her more A∣orous, than he had ever been be∣ore. Those of her Party endea∣oured also to give some Credit  these false reports; but when  was seen, that the Prince did dict himself entirely to his new assion, every one Courted Madam  Fontanges's Favour, who pro∣red good Places for some of her riends, and for the greater part f her Family.
Madam de Montespan, seeing th the Great Alcander weaned him self from her every day more an more, conceived so great a rage  it, that she began publickly  speak ill of Madam de Fontang She told every body, that the Gre Alcander could not be very cu¦ous to love a Girl, who had had I¦trigues in her own Country, wh had neither Wit nor Breeding, an who, at best, was but a Fair pie of Painting. She said a thousan other things concerning her, muc more vexatious than these, whic far from bringing back the Gre Alcander, as she expected, turne him the more from her. Madam de Fontange was broug to Bed in a little time after, an they made use of that opport¦nity, as it was believed, to Poys her, which was attributed to Ma¦dam de Montespan; either for th it was imagined, that one in th vexation which she was in, must
necessity be induced to commit so great a Crime, or because it was believed, that a Lady in Madam de Fontange's Post, could die no o∣ther than a violent death. But be it what it will, she fell into a lan∣guishing condition presently after her lying in, by reason of a con∣tinual Flux of Blood, that, still re∣maining, hindered the Great Al∣cander to ly any more with her. However he did often Visit her, ex∣pressing to her, how sorrowful he was for the condition, whereunto he saw her reduced. But Madam de Fontanges, who perceived her self every day a dying, intreated him to suffer her to retire from Court, adding with tears, that the Malice of her Enemies was the cause, that she now had nothing else to think , but another World. The Great Alcander, who was very glad that she took order with the Affairs of her Salvation, and who also was sensibly concerned
to be present at her sufferings, gran¦ted her what she desired, and sh retired into a Convent in the Su¦burbs of St. James, whither  daily sent to enquire news of her The Duke de la Feuillade went al¦so thither twice or thrice a Wee to Visit her from him, but he al¦ways brought back ill news: Fo this poor Lady having all her no¦ble Parts spoiled, either by the Poi¦son, or by something else, saw he self decline daily, and the Duke  la Feuillade one day, told the Gre Alcander, that she was past all hope of recovery. In effect, she died i a few days after, leaving after h death a greater suspicion of her ha¦ving been Poisoned, than there h been during her sickness; for h¦ving been opened, there were fo within her some little black spe fastned to her noble Parts, wh are, as is pretended, signs of Poiso
The Great Alcander expressed a publick sorrow for the loss of her, nd being willing to shew, that he esteem which he had for her, ontinued even after her Death, he ave an Abby to one of her Bro∣hers, Married one of her Sisters ery advantageously, and did ma∣y other things in Favour of her amily. In the mean time Ma∣am de Montespan did believe, that he King would now return to her; ut she was quite amazed to see Madam de Maintenon have all his onfidence, which put her into a espair, for it being her self, that ad raised Madam de Maintenon  what she was, she could not bear , that her own creature should be  instrument to destroy her. That which tormented her yet e more, was, that she did not be∣eve, that there was any wanton∣ess in their Correspondence, which onsequently ought to be of a lon∣er continuance; since it did not
depend on a wandring love, that begins and often ends all in a day In effect, the Confidence which the Great Alcander hath with Ma∣dam de Maintenon, is observed to continue still even to this day, notwithstanding all that Madam de Montespan could do to destrov it; and on the contrary, he expresses for her only a kind of decent re∣spect, which is nothing else but the leavings of the love of a man of Honour, who uses his Mistress so, rather for his own Reputations sake, than out of any sentiments of ten∣derness. It seemed that the Great Alcan∣der having renounced Love, every body ought to have renounced it likewise, and that the Ladies after Madam de Montespan's example, who now pretends to Chastity, should also become chaste; but, their temper and inclination trans∣porting them beyond all reason, they still remain in the same course of
fe. The Dutchess de la Ferte is more immoderate than ever in her Pleasures, neither is the Dutchess of Vantadour her Sister less wanton, though she manages her business with a little more discretion and conduct. As for the Mareschaless de la Ferte, she is at any man's ser∣vice that will give most, and is en∣dued with so great Humility after certain misfortunes, which have hap∣ned to her, resembling those that I have related of her Daughter in Law, that she hath made a vow ne∣ver to refuse any body, provided that they have but mony. As for what concerns Ma∣damoiselle d'Orleans Monpensier; af∣ter having grieved during ten whole years for the Imprisonment of Mon∣sieur de Lausun, she at length found a way to obtain his Liberty. For considering, that all the Riches in the world are nothing in compari∣son of ones own content, she hath
appeased the Great Alcander's an¦ger with the Principality of Dombe and the County of d'Eu, which she hath assured to the Duke of Maine his natural Son. By this means Monsieur de Lausun is returned, not indeed to Court, but to Paris, where he is obliged to live as a private Man. For the Great Alcander would not permit his Marriage to be declared; but he is so often at the Princesses House, that it is all one as if he lodg∣ed there. In the mean time, this Princess is so jealous of him, that he wishes with all his heart he had never thought on her: She hath set Spies all about him, and he can∣not make a step, that she is not ad∣vertised of; so that going out of one Prison, he is entred into ano∣ther, which appears to him no less cruel. She hath given him some Land by the Great Alcander's con∣sent; but it is all that she hath done for him, for she could not give him one penny of ready money,
having lost all her Credit by this Marriage. For no man is willing to lend her any mony, least it should be hereafter said, that being in a Husband's power, she could not lawfully borrow. This is the oc∣casion that there are four or five years past, since she began to build her House at Choisi, without ha∣ving yet finished it; for the ex∣pence of it must be taken out of her yearly Revenue. But she would be comforted still for all these things, if Monsieur de Lausun were the same that he hath been heretofore. I would say, if he still possest the same quality towards Ladies, that he once did: But it is reported, that he is now so pitiful a Fellow that way, that it is hard to believe, he had formerly been so brave. How∣ever, it is an imperfection that is common to several others; for it is known by experience, that every thing must have an end, and it is for that reason
likewise, that the Princess at this day says, that he impudent∣ly lyed who first said, that a good Horse never grows a Jade. FINIS.
