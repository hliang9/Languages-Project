royal coat of arms of England HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By The KING, A PROCLAMATION. JAMES R. WHEREAS We are certainly informed that Our unnatural Enemy, the Prince of Orange, doth in∣tend suddenly to invade this Our Kingdom of Ireland, having an Army of Forreigners and Re∣bels ready to land in one or more places thereof; and that for the better compassing of his unjust ends therein, and for the better encouragement of the said Forreigners and Rebels in so great an undertaking, the said Prince of Orange hath pro∣mised to bestow and distribute all the Lands of Ireland belonging to all Our Catholicks, and other Our Loyal Subjects here, amongst the said eigners and Rebels, and to confer upon them all the Offices, whether  or Military, Ecclesiastical or Temporal, within this Realm, and there∣upon to extirpate, ruine and destroy all Our Catholicks, and other Our Loy∣al Subjects within this Our Kingdom. For the prevention whereof, We have heretofore summoned all Our Roman Catholick Subjects, from sixteen to sixty, to be ready, as well armed as they can, to oppose the said Invaders. And to the same purpose We have ordered a Militia to be settled in Our seve∣ral Counties of Ireland, and have also commanded certain Forces to be raised for the recruiting Our Standing Army. And whereas several Cap∣tains with great chearfulness, out of their fervent zeal to Vs, have raised several Companies for Our Service, and subsisted them for many months at their own Costs and Charges; some whereof were Regimented under certain Collonels, and others of them were independent Companies, not inlisted in any Regiment: And though We were very sensible of their zealous carriage towards Vs, yet, as well to lessen the charge We were at in supporting
Our Troops, as that the circumstances of Our affairs did not require so great an Army as was then on Foot, We gave Orders that the said several Companies should be layd by from Our then present Service▪ and at the same time ordered that Our thainks should be given them, with an assurance to the said Captains that they should not only be recompenced in due time for their charges, but that they and their said Companies upon the first occasion should be imployed in Our Service, and Mustred in Our Troops, and being resolved to make a Vigorous Defence, against the unjust designes of such Forraigners and Rebels, and having to that purpose set up Our Royal Standard at Our Camp at Dublin, and knowing it to be of great Conse∣quence to Our affairs, that the said Companies so layd by for a time should be made up, and that such of Our Subjects as are provided with Horses, should Immediately come to Our Assistance; We have thought fit by the advice of Our Privy Council to Charge and Require, and We do hereby strictly Charge and Require all such Captains, Inferior Officers and Soul∣diers who were so layed by, and who are not now of Our Standing Ar∣my that they do forthwith get together, and that such Captaines do forth∣with Compleat their respective Companies, and having so don, that they Immediately do Repair to Our Camp at Dublin, or to any other Place where Our Forces shall be Encamped, where they shall be out of hand put in Actual Pay, hereby requiring them to come as well Armed as they can; And We do further by the Advice aforesaid, strictly charge and require all Gentlemen and others of the Roman Catholicks of Ireland, (not being of Our Standing Army, or Officers who are to make up their Companies as aforesaid, and not being Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants or Commissio∣ners of Array appointed in any County) and who are furnished with Ser∣viceable Horses, that they forthwith upon their Allegiance and duty to Vs, repair to Our Royal Standard wherever the same is or shall be, and that they take special care to come as well Armed as they can, to serve Vs, as Volentiers for the defence of the Kingdom, against the Attempts of the said Forraigners and Rebels hereby Declaring that such of them as shall not be able to Subsist themselves, will be Subsisted and suplyed by Vs, Given at Our Court at Our Castle of Dublin, the 5th day of August 1689. And in the fifth year of Our Reign. GOD SAVE THE KING.
