A Memento TO The KINGS Party. HOnourable Gentlemen, and worthy Free men of England, for so ye are by birth, and ought to be all your life long; free from all exorbitant, arbitrary power; a condition certainly, that no man in this Nation ever grudged you, however the late unhappy diffe∣rences have befaln; and when they begun, it was the opinion of divers, that you also wished no worse to any, the oppressi∣on before this Parliament having faln as heavy upon you, as up∣on any other, if not more heavy: For who suffered more then you in Knighthood-money, in the Royal loane, or in the executi∣on of Forrest-law? except some few Courtiers, sprinckled here and there, it is known you suffered more then any: Or which of you, though never so high in honour or birth, was free from the mallice of the Faction, or new raised ruling party of Lords and Bishops in Starchamber, High-Commission, or at Councell-Table? No question ye can remember many vexatious pro∣ceedings, to breake the spirits of the old English Nobility, and Gentry: Which of you could have justice in any Court, if at least ye were known to frowne upon the injustice of the times? Were not many of you, and your Predecessors tired, and worn out of antient inheritances, by long and chargeable suites in Law? And when Pattents and Projects overspread the Land, did not your purses pay as much as any, in every commo∣dity
you bought or used, and if any of you opened your mouthes against them, had you not an ill turne certainly at∣tending you? In your Bed-chambers nor at your Tables were you free, but lay at the mercy of your servants; what viler bondage? Who by countenance of the Court, were as so ma∣ny Informers, to betray their Masters; it being made the com∣mon Road to advancement Did not Ship-money fall as heavy upon you as any? and if ye were favouted, it was not for affection, but to corrupt you, that you might either helpe to oppresse others, or silently al∣low thereof: You cannot but know, if ye consider, that all your breeding tended to encline you to favour Tyrannie, and to neglect, if not betray your Native liberties: False doctrines both civill and religious, were devised purposely to corrupt your understandings, that you should not be able to discerne what Freedome was, what liberties ye were borne to: no prefer∣ment of any nature to be attained, but by abusing the People in one kind or other; and though all sorts of true Englishmen placed their hopes of redresse in Parliaments, yet none were respected, but those that bent their endeavours to destroy them, or abused their trust in them. You had seen Parliaments for many yeares omitted contrary to Law, and sodainly dissolved, contrary to all reason: nay to mention a Parliament was made criminall: And could there be greater injuries offered to a Free People? Indeed, what free∣dome is there, where negative voices are perpetually claimed and insisted on. You had seene palpable superstitions, innovations brought into the Church, by an Arbitrary power; and multitudes of honest People persecuted for non-conformity, which bred ill bloud in the Common-wealth; and shortly after a War was made with Scotland, without advice of Parliament, and for no other cause but refusing a new Service Booke. And was it not evident, by the attempt to engage the Nor∣therne
Armie, and the Scots also, against this Parliament; by the surprize of the five Members, by the Queenes going be∣yond Sea, and the lodaine match of the Princesse with the young Prince of Orange; by the Guard put upon the Parlia∣ment by the Cavalier at Whitehall, and the Kings for saking his usuall aboad there; was it not evident by all these, and the Kings endeavour at Nottingham, and in the North, to raise Forces; that his assent to an Act for abolishing the Starcham∣ber, and High Commission, and for a Trieniall Parliament, was all yeilded unto meerely to worke upon you, and to gaine a party. Can you believe that Ireland was not wrought upon from hence, or that a War was not in design? How speedy was the Queenes operation for Armes, and for sending over Prince Ru∣pert, and Prince Maurice, and how bloudily and furiously did they carry on the War, to the slaughter of aboundance of re∣solute Englishmen on both sides. In the mannaging whereof, what other councels were ye go∣verned by, but meerely a Court Councell, the very same, or nothing differing from that which had brought the former mischiefs upon you: whereas, had those amongst you that re∣ally minded the freedome of the Nation, interposed their own understandings, before things grew to a heigth, and had con∣sidered all Parties, gently, and without prejudice, and taken paines by converse and treaties with them; doubtlesse you had thereby preserved many noble perons and families; you had prevented the slaughter and misery of thousands of People. Yea certainly, had you engaged your understandings, and en∣terested your selves in the Councels (as you adventured your lives and fortunes) with endeavours for a right understanding, and a reconciliation, you had prevented most of that prejudice that is come unto the King, his queen, and children, and those abundant inconveniences whreinto the Parliament hath since fallen, and the great prejudice is come to the People thereby:
the greatest whereof is, that Parliaments, the very fountain of li∣berty, are become odious and hatefull unto them, and if they should either go on as they have done, and end either in cor∣ruption, or by violence, it is much to be feared, Parliaments will ever be strangers in England, and then farewel all freedome for ever. And up then goes the Court as high as ever, and down then must go the true English liberties of Nobility, Gentry, and Commons, even of those that help them up, though somwhat later then others. O therefore all ye that have honours, estates, families, ho∣nest callings and professions, and delight not to fish in troub∣led waters, before it be to late, lay to heart into what a despe∣rate condition ye are again casting the Common wealth: con∣sider for whom ye do it, and see whether it be for the King and his nearest relations; or for your selfe and yours; and whether it be not through impatience at the present injuries and affronts ye have received by the present ruling party: see, and judge im∣partially, whether in this way of violence (you now threat) with all the force and friends ye can make, ye are likely to com∣passe your desires; and if ye should prevaile against your pre∣sent opposers, yet whether it is likely to end there: See if you can guesse where it may end. And on the other side, see, and judge, whether by Treaties with all Parties freely and impartially, without dis-esteem or undervalluing any, you may not without one drop of bloud, without Tumults, or the hazardous and uncertain help of For∣raigners, compasse all your desires that are reasonable. Consider whether now as things are, by violence and Tu∣mults, you are not more likely to faile of your desires, then any otherway. For as concerning the King, you know multitudes have so op∣posed him, that they were as good still persist, and hazard their lives against his violent restoring, as to stand still, and
have him set up in such a manner, as themselves, their Wives, Children, and adherents should lye at his mercy; and how divi∣ded soever you may imagine them, you will find they will be united sufficiently to prevent, or put by all such purposes: Now is any thing more likely to endanger the Kings life and Crown, then these rumultuous appearances; for it may make men take desperate resolutions: besides, you cannot be ignorant of the designes of our no small ones, to lay bie the Father, and to take the youngest sonne, the Duke of Gloster, and under that shadow, to govern by such a Councell as Darby House, the present Parliament, and present Army, or at least by the Rulers of both; yea, so resolved they are of some such course, that they wish the Surrey men, or any other had forced the House; which had but made way for this designe; which rather then faile, they will under the Notion of purging, do themselves, and then is Darby House the only visible authority; and if this design faile, it will be by the prevalence of another party, as bad, if not more destructive to the common wealth. Whereas if you mind the good of the King, your selves, and the quietnesse and prosperity of the Nation, you are patiently to consider, how much is good for the King; what he may have that is consistant with your freedomes, and with the freedome and safety of all those that have opposed him; which upon de∣bate and conference with ingenious men of all Parties, and judgements, you might possibly find, to include no lesse then his returne with honour, free one, and safety, to himselfe and his, if that rightly understood will suffice; for what ever some men may seare, it is possible for a King to be happy, and the People both safe and free; the difference between you and your opposers in the reallity of things being not so great as is imagined; Indeed if affronts, sufferings, losse of goods and friends, with other particular injuries come into the accompt, it raiseth the reckoning on all parts: But since what is past, cannot b undone, a little wisdome on all hands can passe them
over; especially sidce there can be no end without it; and cer∣tainly, few are so unwise or so uncharitable, as not to desire a peaceable and speedy conclusion. There is certainly in reason enough to satisfy all Parties, all just interests; and there wants only a meeting of ingenious men of all Parties and interests, to divide to every one a due portion, and having done it, to perswade the acceptance, of which there would be no doubt or question. But the great hinderance hereunto is, that this worke will onely be expected to have its rise from either the present Par∣liament, Army, and other authority; and it were happy that it should be so: but it can never be so, for these are all become distinct new interests, and cannot consist with this worke of a generall composure, fr of all things nothing is so avoided by the Ruling party of these, as an end of this Parliament, or the disbanding so great a part of this Army as should render it a servant, as it ought to be, and not a master as it is And how is it possible it should be otherwise; for is there not very many in the Parliament, and Army, that enjoy great offices, and revenues, that formerly lived very meanly? Have not many of them purchast Delinquents estates, and Bishops lands to a great value? Is there not Lawyers, formerly of smal practise, that now drive all Courts and Committees before them? Have not some thousands, and some hundreds per an∣num, given them as gratuities, and great summes of money in the Excise, to be received in time with interest? And are any of these, whether in the Army, Houses, or elsewhere, fit Jud∣ges when the Parliament shall end? What assurance can be gi∣ven them, that the next Parliament will ratifie and confirme these things unto them? Till then it is vain to hope upon these. Yet this hinders not but that this worke may go on; for it is not as of late it was: The Ruling part in those are not now so powerfull in the Common wealth, their selfe respects are discerned by all, they are of little power, being beloved of few;
So that if a meeting were had by ingenious persons of every Partie, that all reasons might be heard, and patiently conside∣red; and what should be so agreed upon, afterward perswaded in their severall Relations, it would have such an influence up∣on those corrupt Designers in Parliament, Armie, Citie, and Countries, that it would find no considerable opposition. And certainly if ever there were a season to begin and pros∣per in such a worke, now is the time, for all Parties long to see a period of their troubles, and are generally sensible that they must either condiscend to each other, or be perpetually turmoiled with warres and miseries. But if this be begunne well, and rightly, it must be by your endeavours; for most do judge your Party so disdainfull of all others, that they cannot beleeve you can give eare with pati∣ence and moderation, to your opposers: And therefore as your wisdome and goodnesse will breake through this opinion, so no doubt, when you shall consider your worke, you will not only appoint the fittest persons, but will carefully avoid all undervalluing of men, or parties, that being the bane of all publique workes, or good effects. No question, in the time of Your late suppression, You have found much harshnesse from Committees, and officious busie Informers; abundance of very course natured persons having been employed, which cannot but have heated and vexed many of You; but Reason and Consideration will perswade, that these things are not to be imputed to the whole Party that op∣posed You; for all things being purely weighed, ye have had in the generall no extreame hard measure, the War having beene so violent as it was, and continuing so long as ye had any possi∣bilitie: And however complaints may abound with you, yet losses and affronts are not made whole on the other side: Be∣sides possibly you may imagine how you should have dealt with your opposers, in case You had prevailed; and if it should have been as most men believe, and that from expressions from
no small ones of Yours; you have far lesse cause to disquiet Your selves for what you now suffer. And truly it may be convenient also to remember you, how when time was, that ye were in prosperitie, ye suffered divers good Families, and very many People of the Popish Religion, to lye under extreame oppressive Lawes, without any mercy, or consideration, though there had never passed so long blou∣dy Warres betwixt you, as you have had with those of whom you now complaine. Nor seemed you to be moved with the least compulsion, at the unjust and cruell suffering of Doctor Leighton, Doctor Bastwick,, Master Pryne, and Master Lil∣burne; So that if ye consider the provident disposing hand of God in making good his word upon you, Whatsoever measure ye meat unto others, shall be measured unto you again, ye will find that this correction as yet, hath been more like unto a loving Father then a severe Judge, and ye are with patience to beare what is brought upon you; and wherein ye have suffered wrong not to seeke revenge, but to leave that to God, and to walke wisely in these things for the time to come, and to do as ye would be done unto, making every mans case in judgement as your own, and not to deale more severely with others, then ye would judgee∣quall if the case were yours. As for the helpe ye now of late have been put upon, seeming to relye much upon the generall appearance of the multitude in all places; crying up God and King Charles; ye cannot con∣ceive the danger in making use thereof, for if the King should be brought in so, many of you Gentlemen, by whose perswasions your meaner neighbours, Tennants, and servants rise, will in short time find your lives and estates to be at the mercy of meer Courtiers: Parliaments, and Lawes will be of little force in one seven yeares, and then you will grieve and vex your selves without hope of remedy. Besides, do you know what use may be made of the multi∣tude when once they are up? You have reall and personall
estates, baits that are rempting to men that live as most of them do. Read our Histories, and remember what Popular theames have been made use of upon occasion of publique commotions. And do ye think there will be wanting to spread such motions in such discoursive times as these are? No. And if ye love your selves, and desire the quiet of the Nation, awake not a sleeping Lyon, nor raise a Furie which will be out of your power to lay again. Let this word to the wise be sufficient; for to have laid this more open to you, is not safe, in respect of others, who by too palpable caution might have been instructed Another main thing ye are to beware of, is the craft and po∣licy of such as are meere Statesmen, who make it their trade to devide the People; and for that cause have ever heightened the quarrel between Papist and Protestant, and between them both and the Puritan, and now of late have sub-divided the Puritan into divers factions, by favouring one more then others, pre∣tending that they esteem one more Orthodox, and right in the Worship and Service of God, then the other; whereas in truth they beare affection to none at all; but by this meanes keepe men so divided, that they seldome or never agree in any thing, for their own good, or to preserve themselves from those com∣mon oppressions which Statesmen for their own ends only, bring upon them: And as this was evident formerly, (which ye cannot but know) so is it now. For who is there that doth not groan under the most unjust oppression that ever was, viz. A long Parliament, and the innumerable evil fruits thereof, Ex∣cise, Taxes, imperious Officers in an Army, most abominable Committees, and Arbitrary imprisonments, yet by this Stratta∣gem of division they are secure, and in hope (if you and others be not wise, and diligent very speedily, will prevaile) to keep them upon us from generation to generation. But if ye once rightly consider, you will find your Peace and happinesse depends not upon the Councell and advice ye re∣ceive from Statesmen, or great ones, or upon Kings or Parlia∣ments;
You may be freemen under both, and you may be slaves un∣der both, or either, even as you will your selves; for if ye will ex∣ercise those abilities of understanding and discretion which God hath given you, in holding union with all sorts of serious, peaceable People; you will then be able to keep all authority (which is made by, and for you, and not you for it) within its due bounds, and to its just end, which is the safety and wel-being of the whole People. Be ye therefore resolved to preserve your Birthright, which is Freedome; and what government soever ye have, or whomsoever ye trust with any Authority, be sure to see Reason rule, and let every man know what he is to trust to. Be no longer upon uncertainties, but know what is trusted to a King, to Lords, to Commons, to all Judges, and Magistrates; above all ascertain the supream Authority, the want whereof as it hath been, so will it ever be the occasion of contentions & warres. But whatever is in doing, be carefull your freedomes be not infringed, and that you take not a shaddow for a sub∣stance, a Scorpion for a Fish; for all Arts are at worke to de∣ceive you, as Personall Treaties, Hampton Court Propositions, which include bondage; Let not old customes or opinions of Govern∣ment make too deep impression in you, you have as much power of right to better your Estate of Freedome in Covernment, as your fore∣fathers had, and are not to be limitted by their understandings no more then they were by heir fore-fathers: let all the world know what you trust to those you choose into Authoritie, and see that severe punish ments be annexed to the brech of trust; and to Arbitrary innovation in government, that the highest may feare and stand in awe; otherwise you must not looke long to continue Freemen. But all rests upon your union with all sorts of well-meaning men, and upon your conjunction in councell with them, discourse and reasoning being the author of all great and good effects; therefore prejudge no∣thing, nor feare impossibilities; but by your wisdome, gentlenesse, and condiscention, make your enemies your friends; and then by joynt ad∣vice and debate, do as God shall direct and informe your consciences, for the peace and prosperity of the whole Nation, FINIS.
