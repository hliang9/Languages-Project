Newes out of Holland: Concerning Barnevelt and his fellow-Prisoners their Con∣spiracy against their Natiue Country, with the Enemies thereof: THE Oration and Propositions made in their behalfe vnto the Generall States of the vnited Prouinces at the HAGVE, by the Ambassa∣dors of the French KING. WITH Their Answere therevnto, largely and truely set downe: And certaine Execrable Articles and Opinions, propounded by Adrian du Bourg, at the end. VVherevnto is adioyned a Discourse, wherein the Duke D'Espernons revolt and pernicious deseignes are truely displayed, and re∣prehended, by one of his Friends. LONDON: Printed by T. S. for Nathanael Newbery, and are to bee sould at his shop vnder S. Peters Church in Cornehill, and in Popes-head Alley at the signe of the Star. 1619.
THE ORATION AND PROPOSITIONS made on Barnavelt's and his fellow-Priso∣ners behalfe, by the French Kings Ambassadors, to the generall Estates of the vnited Prouinces of HOLLAND, &c. at the presenting of his Maiesties Letters vnto the said Estates. MY Lords, the King our Master commanded vs, to recommend vnto you the same which we haue heretofore at other times motioned, touch∣ing the good, and peace of your estate: although it hath not bin conside∣red according to the worthinesse of the merit of his alliance and amitie: but in the present state of your affaires, his Maie∣stie will not cease to witnesse vnto you, that he hath no lesse care thereof, then of the peace and tranqui∣litie of his owne Kingdome. We will therefore proceede to exhort you, to continue stedfast in the vnion of your Prouinces, as the principall foundation of your estate, and to be
carefull, that the changing of Magistrates and Counsellors, which hath bin made in diuers of your Townes, doe not breede enmities and dissentions among your Citizens, instead of ceasing them; for that, all mutations and changes of Magistrates, Lawes, and policies are dangerous to publique go∣uernements, if they be not made vpon great ne∣cessity, and so profitable for the Commons, that no man may haue cause to dislike them: Therefore it is requisite for you to take order, that the Magi∣strates, by their good and iust proceedings and be∣hauiours, may obtaine and deserue the good-will of the people; and shew themselues so modest to∣wards them that are dismissed, that the inconstant multitude may haue no occasion to repine at such alteration; and that those that haue bin deposed from their charges, should patiently endure and beare that alteration, as being made for the com∣mon good of the state. The Sinode which you haue caused to be assem∣bled, puts vs in good hope that it will be a meanes to procure peace and concord touching those points of Religion, which haue bred trouble and schisme in these Prouinces among you: To make it effectuall and fruitfull, it is requisite that it should be free, and secure for all those that shall therein assemble together, and that the points in contro∣uersie should be examined and disputed of, without passion, or for any other consideration, then onely for the honour of God, and the peace of mens con∣sciences. And certainely, whosoeuer taketh vpon him to
interpret, or attaine vnto those high misteries and treasures of diuine wisedome, without great humi∣lity and submission; shall finde himselfe as farre off from them, as he thinketh he approacheth neere vnto them. We are likewise to tell you somewhat from the King, touching your Prisoners, and to shew you, how much it concerneth the honour and reputati∣on of your affaires, and generally the peace of your Prouinces, and concord among your subiects, to administer vnto them good and speedy Iustice. They are accused of the most inorme and detesta∣ble crimes that can be, as of Treason against their natiue Countrey, secret intelligence with your ene∣mies, and for hauing exposed your Townes vnto the danger of pillage, and effusion of blood. If they be culpable of these disloyalties, the King our Master giueth you counsell and aduise to exer∣cise the rigour of your Lawes against them. But as those crimes are grieuous, and worthy of most great punishment; so they haue beene reduced to cer∣taine points, whereunto good and wise Princes, and well gouerned common-wealths would not stretch them. To the contrary, diuers Princes haue shewed themselues ready to pardon, euen such enterprises as haue bin done against their owne persons: and the freest Common-wealths, alwaies vsed to spare the blood of their Citizens; and that in the greatest malefactors; it being one of the principallest signes of liberty and freedome, not easily or lightly to touch the life of Citizens.
Therefore the crime of Treason ought to be ta∣ken and vnderstood in her proper tearmes, with∣out drawing it by consequences and inductions to other actions which are not of the same quality. The contentions which oftentimes arise and are made in the management of affaires, the iealousies of power and authority, and ambition which al∣waies drawes and driues men to enterprise and take more vpon them then they should, are ordi∣nary euils in all states; whereby many inconueni∣ences and mischiefes ensew. Neuerthelesse, they were neuer esteemed nor held to be treason against the State, because crimes and offences are iudged by the will and intent, and not by the euent. We doubt not, my Lords, but that in your in∣tegrities and wisedomes you make distinction as you should, of the faith and actions whereof men are accused; question being made of the liues of your officers & subiects placed in authority, wher∣of one is the auncientest Counsellor of your state, which is Monsieur Barneuelt, so much commended for the good and notable seruices by him done for these countries, whereof the Princes and States and allies vnto the same are witnesses, that it is hardly to be thought or beleeued, that he should haue conspired treason against his natiue Countrie, for the which you your selues know hee hath taken so great paines: neuerthelesse seeing he is called in question by order of Law, it importeth the secu∣rity of your estate, that the truth should be known; which to doe, you ought both for him, and the rest also to appoint Iudges that are neither suspected
nor passionate, that iudge according to the Lawes of the Countrey, vpon cleere and euident proofes, as equitie requireth, and not vpon coniectures and presumptions, which oftentimes deceiue Iudges; because there are many things that are apparant and very likely, which neuerthelesse are not true; and others that are true, and yet haue no likeli∣nesse thereof: and so by moderate and vpright Iudgement, you shall manifest vnto the world, that you are worthy of the possession and commande∣ment of this estate, to the gouernement whereof God hath called you. The counsell which the King giueth you, touch∣ing these Prisoners, is, not to vse rigour against them; but rather fauour and clemency, as most ac∣ceptable vnto God, and fit and conuenient to win the hearts of the people, & to make them obe∣dient. It is the security of States, such as yours is, to revnite your subiects which are diuided, and to molefie and appease the dislikes and bitternesse, which is among them; wherevnto we haue speci∣all charge to adde his Maiesties request and recom∣mendation, in respect of the interest which he hath in the preseruation of your State, and his know∣ledge of the great seruices, which this Prisoner hath done for you; as also of the affection; which he al∣wayes bare to the maintenance of the alliance be∣tweene France and this State, so notable actions and testimonies of his loyaltie and fidelity, that they seeme to exclude all suspition of treason and disloyaltie; and whereof as yet, his Maiesty can∣not
hold or thinke him to be culpable, vntill by euident proofes you make the crime manifest vn∣to him. Now after so many good aduises, which are on the Kings behalfe propounded vnto you, if you, for your parts, rather chuse a rigorous course, his Ma∣iestie shall haue sufficient glory and satisfaction, to haue, like a true friend and allie, giuen you whole∣some and sound counsels, whereof the vse and e∣uent will be as happy and profitable for your State, as the contrary is hurtfull and dangerous: And his Maiestie cannot chuse but be much offen∣ded at the small respect which you still make of his counsels, requests, and amitie, which thereby may procure as much slacknesse, as in times past you haue found promptnesse and fa∣uourablenesse in your neede. In the Hague, presented to the States. Signed, de Thumerie, and, du Morier.
The generall States answere to the Propositions, made vnto them by the French KINGS Ambassadors. THe STATES generall of the vnited Prouinces, hauing in o∣pen assembly, heard, and deli∣berately pervsed the Proposi∣tions of Messieurs do Boissise & du Morier, Ambassadors of the most christian King of France, deliuered by word of mouth the 12 of this month, and the next day in writing, by vertue of their Let∣ters of Credit, bearing date the 28. of Nouember. signifie and declare, that as they haue had nothing in more singular recommendation, then by the vp∣rightnes of their actions and gouernments, to giue all good meanes and occasions vnto his Maiestie, to moue him to continue his royall fauours and aides (following the example of the late King, of immor∣tall memory & incomparable wisdome) vnto them, for the good and maintenance of their Common∣wealth: to the which end also, they haue alwayes carefully, in their need, sought for and imbraced his wholesome counsels, aduises, and fauours, against the threatnings, deuises and powers of their ene∣mies, for the which they are oblieged to giue and yeeld all kinde of thankes and gratefulnes vnto his Maiestie and kingdome: So they are exceedingly much grieued, to perceiue themselues to be mista∣ken, and taxed, not to haue resolued vpon the
affaires done for them vpon occasion of these last motions, touching the good of this State, according to the merit of his alliance and amitie, because they cannot conceiue wherevpon this complaint of dis∣like should be grounded; in regard that they haue alwaies had a speciall care, most exactly to obserue and keepe all the points, & Articles of Couenants, which they haue had the honour to haue con∣tracted and renewed with his Maiestie, not once neglecting any clause thereof, whereby the least cause or occasion of discontentment, or iealousie might grow or arise; and therefore the said States, assure themselues, that continuing the same course for the securitie of their state, which hitherto they haue carefully held and obserued, in the strict a∣mity, and confederation wherewith the two Kings consequently haue vouchsafed to honour him, his maiestie will not at this present make any other construction of their wills, and present carriages, then that which is requisite to be made of a state which is most thankefull for, and memoratiue of, his fauours and benefits, and no lesse desirous to shew the continuance of the most strict bond there∣of, in all respects which shall be thought or found to be profitable for the seruice of his Maiestie, and conuenient for their owne securitie. Neuerthelesse the said states, receiue and accept of, (as a most great fauour) the good and whole∣some counsells which it pleaseth his Maiestie to giue them, in this present estate wherein their affai∣res now stand, exhorting them to remaine firme and constant in the vnion of their prouinces, be∣cause
they are altogether conformable to their in∣tents; for they haue alwaies had the same desire and designe, specially to be carefull of the meanes to preserue and defend their state against their ene∣mies, and to vse their friends and Allies worthily, according to their quallities and degrees. They also say that they haue not without great & good consideration beene moued to change cer∣taine of their Magistrates, in some of their Townes: whereof it may be, the report hath beene other∣wise spread abroad, then the case requireth, seeing that the remedy was most necessary & easie being wisely and moderately applyed, without any vio∣lence or danger of bloud-shedding, in such manner that publique authority, vnion by peace, and assu∣rance against disorders are entirely established, which certaine ambitious & factious spirits would haue much altered, not without great danger, (if longer forbearance & patience had beene vsed) to ouerthrow and destroy all the state, and to the ru∣ine and desolation of good men, and to the preiu∣dice of his Maiestie, & the good of his kingdome. Besides that, they haue onely made a necessary change of some certaine persons, not once thereby touching or altering the lawes, rights or pollicies of their Townes; neither haue they had any other intent or meaning in their elections of new Magi∣strates, then onely to cease the great partialities that haue crept in among them, by the practise of factious persons, which in those Townes and fa∣milies proceeded so farre as to erect Alter against Alter: and in the same changes they haue placed
none but such persons as are well quallified, faith∣full, and affected to their Countrie, who without doubt, by their vpright and iust behauiour, know full well how to procure and get the good-will of the people, and to preserue and defend the State from all violent alterations or motions; and that in many Townes the proofe of this lenitie alreadie appeareth, in that the order which hath beene re∣effablished for the protection and defence of Inno∣cents, against the first oppression, is already nota∣ble and pleasing, whereby all the members of this State conspire and consent together to cast off and abandon their bad motions, and to raunge them∣selues vnder lawfull obedience, by voluntarie ac∣knowledging of their superiours: And that if this proceeding of their factious subiects had drawne them vnto any greatextreamity, they would hope∣fully haue relied vpon the ordinary good will of his Maiestie, for their support and meanes, which might haue failed them, by their power to haue re∣dressed those confusions, which by the mercie and goodnesse of God they did in time preuent, with∣out trouble or extraordinary charge to their allies. Touching the Sinode, which hath beene called and assembled together in these Prouinces, they al∣waies certainely beleeued, that therby some means of peace and concord concerning, those points of religion which haue bin the cause to administer trouble in the Churches of some of their Prouinces, would be found, esteeming it the most meet, aun∣cient, and lawfull meanes thereunto, vsed in the pri∣matiue Church, euen in the time of the Apostles:
But what meanes soeuer they haue heretofore vsed to obtaine and publish that conuocation, it was neuer till now in their power to attaine to that holy and wholesome remedie, to rule and stop the differences in their first birth: And his Maiesty may well call to minde and remember, if it pleaseth him, the intreaties and humble motions diuers times made by them vnto him, to be ayded and assisted in this good worke, by the assistance of some of his subiects, chosen out of the reformed Churches in his Realme; but were crossed and put off by them, with a small number of persons, who contra∣ry to all reason and order of gouernement, neg∣lecting their vocation, outwardly made the iust la∣bour of the said States vnfruitfull: but now neuer∣thelesse that by the goodnesse of God, and the most wise and resolute conduction and dexterity of the Prince of Orange, they haue assured their tem∣porall state from present danger, they thought it not conuenient to neglect the care which they ought to haue of the Spirituall: To the which end, the Sinode was freely opened, and began to be hol∣den in the Moneth of Nouember last, as they desi∣red, with this onely prescription and clause, not to seeke any other thing thereby, then the honour of God, and the peace of mens consciences, in the pu∣ritie of his word, wherein there is found and assem∣bled so great a number of excellent persons, both for pietie and vprightnesse, chosen and appointed thereunto by their superiours, that the States haue good cause to hope well of their labours; and that also, by Gods holy grace, the euent will testifie their iust and sincere intentions, to the content∣ment
of his Maiestie, the good and peace of their common-wealth, and the confusion of the authors of this faction. Further the said State also esteeme, weigh, and thinke very well of the reasons and considerati∣ons formerly set downe by the said Lords Ambas∣sadours, in fauour of the Prisoners, to administer vnto them good and speedie Iustice, and to vse them fauourably, if they haue not conspired the ruine of their State, with their enemyes: but for that the said States haue beene continually busied about setling the necessary securitie of their com∣mon-wealth, which had been greatly shaken by the violent proceedings of such as aspired to nouelties, by alteration of Religion, Iustice, and fundamen∣tall Lawes of all polliticke orders: and that other∣wise this conspiracie grew so great, that nothing was exempted from the infection thereof, they thought it not conuenient to run headlong vpon such a processe of so great importance, & that first it was most fit seuerally to gather and collect all such euidences as might tend vnto, and concerne the same, for their full instruction therein, clearely to make knowne and manifest the grounds and depth of the cause, and that such delay could not be any wayes hurtfull or preiudiciall to the Cri∣minells, if they presumed to haue any aduantage to iustifie their innocency. Notwithstanding, there hath not therein bin any losse of time, but things haue bin done orderly and diligently, & haue alrea∣dy proceeded so farre, that they are perswaded that iudgement shall not long be deferred, and such without doubt, that at the publication thereof, all
their allies, which affect the prosperity of this State, and specially his Maiestie, who is a iust and vertu∣ous Prince, will commend their vpright dealing, when they shall be better informed of the state of the conspiracie. In the meane time, they desire the said Lords Ambassadors, to assure his Maiestie from them, that they will encline themselues so much to clemencie and fauour (wherevnto they, and the condition of their gouernment are naturally addicted) as equi∣tie, iustice, and the preseruation of their State, may in any wise permit them: Hoping that his Maiestie (in regard of the cause) will not be perswaded to prefer the important and ill-grounded solicitations of certaine particular criminels, or of their fauou∣rites, before the generall interest of the dignitie and worthines of this Common-wealth; but to the con∣trary perswade themselues that his Maiestie will finde it more expedient for his seruice, & the good of the said Prouinces, to referre the same to the said States gouernment and iudgement, which they will take paines to conclude and finish, with so much equitie and clemencie among themselues, that the obedience of their subiects shall by their authority be confirmed, and with so great wisdome & respect of their allies, that his Maiestie shall haue occasion to content himselfe with the duty which they will shew for the obseruation and maintaining of his alliance with them, whereof they will truly yeeld him satisfaction. Giuen in the Hague at the generall assembly of the said States. Seauen
Seauen ARTICLES propounded by Adrian du Bourg. 1. THat Originall-sinne, is no sinne, but an occasion of Sinne. 2. That the great Mercy of God, is the onely cause of mans good, and that hee hath power to accept or refuse it. 3. That Faith, by the vertue of Gods great mercy, is the proper worke of man. 4. That Gods prouidence is such, that it foreseeth all things, but worketh not in men particularly, whom he leaueth to their free-will. 5. That the faithfull or beleeuing Children of God, in this life, may perfectly accomplish Gods commaunde∣ments, although they doe them not. 6. That the Children of God may fall from his grace and sauing mercie, and so be damned. 7 That the originall cause of Iustification before God, is the passion of Christ, but the workes of Obedience are the first originall cause of this Iustification.
The Duke D'Espernons reuolt and pernicious Designes, truely displayed and reprehended by one of his Friends. IT is true, and a common say∣ing, my Lord, that those which vse to play, before they begin, should be sure to make a good match: it is the same aduise which you your selfe gaue to a turbulent spirit, that sought the disquietnesse and ruine of France: an aduise which you suggested to be conuenient, by the knowledge that you had, that those who seeke to set vpon and conspire against their King, in the end come by the losse, I meane both of honour and life: And neuerthelesse for∣getting your owne instructions, and the examples which time hath produced; you are now fallen in∣to the same crymes, which formerly you abhor∣red, and thereby become disobedient and rebelli∣ous: Crimes, so much the more to be blamed, as they are committed by a person, who not onely ought to shun them, but to the contrary, is oblie∣ged and bound by all manner of duties, to imploy both his body and goods against those that enter∣prise
them. I am so much grieued at your procee∣dings, that it moueth me boldly without difficul∣ty to tell you, (being culpable as you are) that my aduise is, and instantly I beseech you, to seeke out meanes to cure your malady, and to procure your owne safety, and therein to take my counsell, haue∣ing heretofore giuen you warning of your former actions, at the least, I shall discharge my selfe of the duety which I owe vnto you, for the fauours I haue receiued at your hands, and I call heauen to witnesse of my sincerity; let me then intreat you, to peruse these few lines, and suffer the truth therein by me set downe, to worke some remorse of conscience in you. Vpon what doe you thinke, I beseech you, when you discharge your arrowes against the Kings Maiesty, and the peace of his estate? you that haue both the grace and honour to be one of the officers of his crowne, and haue as much charge and commoditie as any other a∣bout him? This is not the way, by waxing elder, to grow wiser, but rather to counterfeit the Ape, which the older it groweth, the vnhappier it is. What? in a manner hauing one foote already in the graue, to damne his owne soule, and disobay the King? and not onely to disobay him, but to offend him, in the dearest thing that he hath, and not onely to offend him therein, but to take vpon you to raise his Subiects to beare armes against him vnder light pretences, as the truth well sheweth; I neither know, nor can conceiue, how a man estee∣med to be wise, whose beard is gray, and seemeth to be of a stayed iudgement, should fall into so great
folly; pardon me for speaking so freely: A Can∣ker must be lanched and cut away, your euill is no lesse, and most dangerous. You are not ignorant, that Kings are the images of the liuing God, that their wils and commandements are Lawes to be specially obserued, and that no man can dispense therewith, without being guilty of high treason, both diuine and humane, and yet, you haue not onely ventred to disobey them, but also by a man∣ner of new interpretation, haue directly withstood his commandements. The King thought your personall presence to be necessary in Metz, and you thought the contrary, and that your abode there would not like you, though you were appointed thereunto; his Maiestie desired your seruice in those parts, and you would perferre certaine par∣ticular affaires, to satisfie your owne pleasures and inclinations, as if we were at the Romaines Sa∣turnals. You must grant mee this, that there are no examples for your proceedings, and that if in times past, there were rebels and disobedient Subiects, they alwaies sought to dissemble, and to couer and hide their pretences with necessity: you vse not any such meanes, but are rather more hardned, & seeme directly and openly to oppose your selfe against his Maiestie: What punishment thinke you doth such a crime deserue? One fault willingly and most commonly draweth on another. What haue you done since you came from Metz? You haue borne away the Kings Mother, and carried her to An∣goulisme,
where you spread the ensignes of reuolt, and there determine vpon warre, and the subuer∣sion of the State? What audaciousnesse is this, and whatan enterprise haue you vndertaken, to circum∣uent the intents of a good Mother, towards her deare Sonne; to trouble and set at variance the harmony and consent of their wils; to shake, and as it were to breake the bond of nature, and vio∣lently to pull out of so great a Princes brest, the loue which she oweth to her Sonne, to her King, and to him that specially loueth her? Miserable man, (if I must needes vse this tearme) what is your pretence? To ruinate his Maiesties affaires, and to ouerthrow and subuert the publique peace of the Land? It is the conceit of a franticke braine, go∣uerned by the author of malice: Doe you not think and perswade your selfe, that reason once taking place, but that the Queene will condemne your pernicious designes, and the proceedings that you haue caused her to vse? there is no doubt there∣of, your forces cannot altogether breake and dissi∣pate the principall motions of her suggestions, which are Nature and the feare of God, able and sufficient to driue away the clouds and fictions wherewith you serue your turne: The common people, manifestly see it, and curse you, as often as they behold and looke into the euils which you bring vpon them: They know that his Maiestie is a most Christian Prince, that he loueth his Mo∣ther perfectly well, and that he neuer gaue any iust cause to procure this euasion: They are assured
and otherwise comforted, that this separation can∣not continue long: Their mutuall desire already is to see one another, and to shew the effects of their reciprocall loues: Expect not then to fortifie the weakenesse of your cause, by the detention of the Queenes person; you shall neuer haue the con∣sent of her heart and will, to the ruine of the State, and her owne glory. But this is not all, I must begin againe, and leade you to the execution of that which this burning feuer enduceth in your fantasie. You haue diso∣bayed, & allienated (as you pretend) the Queenes intents, you must now blame the gouernement both within and without the Realme, and in all places proclaime warre, and the desolation of your Countrey; wherein specially your designe cannot take effect. Forraigne Princes honour, & too much desire the amity and alliance of our Monarch; they haue seene miracles, as it were, in his actions, and that in his young yeares, with a manly and reso∣lute generositie, he hath danted the monsters of his Realme, and by an admirable care and wisedome, procured peace to those that had warre; which is the cause, that by a generall consent they giue him the glorious title of the Arbitrator of Christendome; and his amity is so desirable and profitable, that such as are admitted thereunto (how farre distant soeuer they be) sleepe and take their rests, without any apprehension of trouble; how then will they vnderstand your clamours, vnlesse it be to blame and condemne them?
The peace that we enioy, is an euident testimo∣ny of the piety, iustice, and prouidence of our King; and therefore it is impossible that your in∣uentions should destroy the truth, and that which we see with our owne eyes, in such manner, that if in long time, there hath beene a happy raigne in France, it is now at this present, where all Orders and degrees are seene to flourish; Vertue therein is commended, and Pietie (the true support of the State) particularly adored, where our King is as it were, a perfect modell; Ecclesiasticall persons are reuerenced, and called to counsell in his Maie∣sties most important affaires, they enioy and pos∣sesse their reuenewes without trouble; the Nobi∣lity are loued and respected; Iustice is indifferent∣ly and without feare executed; the Commons are not oppressed nor charged with Subsidies or new impositions; and all estates together, haue nothing so much in recommendation, nor so deare, as this good King, for whose health and prosperity they daily make their feruent prayers vnto God. How then should they be moued to offence? and that to accommodate your humours, they should set fire on their houses, and ruinate and spoile one the other, after that to expect nothing else but misery in this life, and damnation in the life to come? I know assuredly, that you specially build your designes vpon the inconstancy of the popularity, as if the consideration of your person, or of any others, were of more importance vnto them, then
the Kings, and their owne preseruation: There∣in you are deceiued; the loue and obedience that they beare and owe vnto him, are by Gods owne finger ingrauen in their hearts, with a caracter im∣possible to be defaced, and your name is execra∣ble, as the sworne enemy of their good: they openly report and say, that it is impossible that he which is wicked & cruell against his own children, should euer be good to others; that he which see∣keth the ruine & subuersion of his natiue Country, vnworthy of humaine society: that the poyson of your venemous heart hath long time appeared, and that it ought and should be choaked in the birth; that the spots and vncleanenesse of your soule, and the counsels which your actions haue imposed vpon it, makes you play the last act of your Tragedy. To conclude and be short, they are willing to contribute and giue fire and fagot to consume the author of so many mischiefes. I dis∣scribe all these circumstances vnto you without flattery, to let you see the state wherevnto your affaires are reduced. Tell me now, who hath brought you to these extreamities? Is it the discontentment of the Queene? she had no other but that onely which you haue procured; and say that she had, doth it belong to you to intermeddle with the difference that is between Princes? It is not like that of yours: The Sonne and the Mother would soone haue a∣greed together, and good endeauour would haue reduced all things to their true ends: Therein you
are two-fold culpable; one by shewing your e∣uill will; the other by seeking to set diuision be∣tweene the Sonne and the Mother, the Subiect and the King, and a loue which could not be broken, but by the impiteous windes of your si∣nister counsels. It may be, ye will alleadge that you are none of his Maiesties priuie-Counsellours, and your honour is such that you would know all, that you may enterprise much; let vs reason boldly: The counsell which the King now hath, is the same that his Father had, who by his valorous actions, and wise conduction, was called the wonder of Kings: That great King, made profit of mens actions, and perfectly vnderstood the mindes of his subiects, and yet he neuer-made you priuie to the counsell of his most important affaires: He was content to doe you good, and to continue you in the Offices that you enioyed; must you then complaine, that the King his sonne, and successour in his vertues, followeth the same course and counsell, by the ayde and dexterity whereof, he had giuen vs a ge∣nerall peace, and almost a golden world? Beleeue mee, rather praise and commend that good King, who in a manner had buried in obliuion the me∣morie of that which you know, and which I dare not touch, fearing to offend his indul∣gence: I leaue it to the registers of the Court of Parliament. Is it possible that you should be discontented, that his Maiesty affecteth, and doth good to some
one of his Seruitors, more then to you. I thinke you are not at that point; for what other should that then be, but to shew your selfe vnthankefull for, and to condemne that which Henry the third did for you? He loued you most particularly, and gaue you all that you enioy, besides 8000. Franks yearely reuenews. This your great fortune, was much enuyed, and many men spake thereof, to your preiudice, which reason denyed: I remem∣ber that some in respect of you said, that men in Kings hands, are like vnto Counters which they make to value as much as they thinke good: And that there was neuer any Monarch, but that shew∣ed some proofes of particular affections, which in truth are Royall actions, worthy of commen∣dation. And it is no small good, to a great Prince, to make a good choyse of, and to haue faithfull seruitors about him, with securitie and famili∣arity, to whom hee may discouer and disclose his heart, and thoughts: Euery one of vs see it by experience, and finde nothing more pleasing and acceptable, then to impart and vnfold our affaires vnto, and with those whose affections and amities are well knowne vnto vs. Our King loueth with great iudgement, hee knoweth and will acknow∣ledge the merit and fidelitie wherewith he hath bin serued; I meane, the more he (specially) whom he loueth, hath amiable quallities and worthy the esti∣mation of a King. I will not particularize them, nor proceed further in this subiect, only I will say, that we must hold all that for Law, which pleaseth the
Prince, and that for their sake, we must loue those whom they loue, much lesse ought wee to enuye and hate them: It should in truth be a most hard thing, and without all likelihood or apparance of reason for Subiects to impose lawes to their soue∣raignes, and to master their pleasures and affecti∣ons, they themselues being free in their owne particular houses, to loue and to doe good to those to whom they will; and I say further, that the fauour and fortune whereof wee speake, alte∣reth not that which is due vnto Princes, neither yet abateth any thing of the aduantage and esti∣mation of the Nobilitie, nor vseth any violence or euill entertainement towards others, whereby we may truly say, that no man can nor may dislike or contradict it, but onely of meere enuy, the sworne enimy of all good actions, and of the aduancement and greatnesse of vertuous men. This is the Table or Portraiture which I thought good to set before your eyes, without dissimulation, to let you see the greatnesse of your faults, and the extreamity whereinto you are falne. It may be you will be grieued that I display them so openly; I protest that I haue not set them all downe, and that without doing wrong to you, and to mine owne intent, I could not say lesse. My pur∣pose is herein to set downe sufficient to perswade you to the truth, and to search the wound to the bottome, to the end, that hauing any feeling, you your selfe may seeke how to heale it; you should doe it while time serueth: This is the aduice which
I will giue you. A Lampe goeth out if you put too much moysture vnto it; acknowledge that your too great estate hath reduced you to this point of great losse, and not yours onely, but your chil∣drens, whom you cruelly drew into your rebelli∣ons. Kings haue Iron armes; for Gods sake stay not till our King lifts vp his, you will surely be bro∣ken in pieces with the blow; preuent it by humili∣ty, certainely his Matesty is iust and benigne; hee punisheth and exterminateth obstinate Rebells, but he pardoneth those that aske mercy and for∣giuenesse. It is the onely hauen wherein you shall finde hope of reliefe, refer your selfe with a good heart freely vnto his bounty, and you shall not be deceiued in your expectation. Suffer the Queene to be at libertie to revnite and ioyne her affections with her Sonnes; let your children be suerties and pledges of your libertie, let them fall downe at his Maiesties feete, to protest and warrant your amendment, and your most humble submissions to full fill all obedience in time to come: Discharge your Souldiers, and let euery place sound the praise of so compleat a Prince, and your resolution to die in his seruice. I am with∣out doubt perswaded, that this proceeding will be acceptable vnto him, and that following the example of Henry the great, his father, he will im∣brace and preserue you. What glory (my Lord) will it be vnto you to haue appeased the wrath of so puissant a Prince? To haue of your selfe reob∣tained his fauour? To haue pacified the tumult
which you had raised in his Realme? To haue procured peace to your owne soule, and rest vn∣to your latest daies, and to haue reestablished the state and fortunes of your Children. I be∣seech God gine you grace earnestly to thinke vpon these things, and to put them in effect: I desire and wish it more then any other, that I may see you restored, and haue the meanes hereafter to say, as I haue hether done that I rest Your most humble and most affectioned seruant, L: S. D. From Paris the 28. of March, 1619. Stilo nouo.
