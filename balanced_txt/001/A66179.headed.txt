His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. My Lords and Gentlemen, YOU have shewn so great Concern for My Person, and Zeal for My Government, and have done so much for the Preservation of the One, and for the Strengthning of the Other, by the Good Laws which have been made, and by the Sup∣plies you have Provided for the several Occasi∣ons of this Year, that the late Designs of Our Enemies are (by the Blessing of God) like to have no other Effect, than to let them see how firmly We are United, and to give Me this Occasion to Acknowledge your Kindness, and to Assure you of all the Returns which a Prince can make to His People.
My Lords and Gentlemen, The Necessity of Affairs requiring My Ab∣sence out of the Kingdom for some time, I do earnestly Recommend to you, That in your se∣veral Stations you will be Assisting to those whom I shall leave to Administer the Govern∣ment, and that you will be careful in Preserving the Publick Peace of the Kingdom. Then the Lord Keeper, by His Majesties Com∣mand, said, My Lords and Gentlemen, IT is His Majesties Royal Will and Pleasure, That this Parliament should be Prorogued to Tuesday the Sixteenth day of June next; and this Parliament is accordingly Prorogued to Tuesday the Sixteenth day of June next. FINIS.
