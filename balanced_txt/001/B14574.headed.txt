WHereas by a Common Councell holden the ninth day of A∣prill, in the seuen and thirtieth yeare of the reigne of our late Soueraigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth, an Act was made, for preuention of Theft, Burglaries, Robberies, and Fellonies within the City of London and the Liberties of the same, by establishing a Registry to bee kept, of all the Bargaines, Contracts, Sales, and Pawnes of Plate, Iewels, Goods, Wares, Marchandizes, Apparrell, Bookes, Beddings, Remnants, and Ends of Silke, Veluet, and of Linnen and Woollen Cloth, and other such like things sold or pawned by base shifting and suspected persons, to retailing Broakers, Broggers, or Hucksters, and other such persons as vse to buy or take to pawne olde Apparrell, housholdstuffe, bed∣ding, bookes, ends and remnants of silke and veluets, or of linnen or woollen Cloth, or such like, to sell againe, inhabi∣ting within the City of London and Liberties thereof: Which Act hath not taken such effect as was thereby purposed, and is to be wished it should haue done. And, whereas by another Act of Common Councell holden the six and twentieth day of Ianuary, in the sixt yeare of the Kings Maiesties reigne of England that now is, It was for the reasons there∣in mentioned, enacted by the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Commons in the saide Common Councell assembled: That from thenceforth, all and euery such retailing Broker, Brogger, or Huckster, or o∣ther person or persons that should from thenceforth vse to buy or take to pawn old Apparrel, houshold stuffe, bedding, bookes, ends, and remnants of Silkes, veluets, or of linnen or woollen cloth, or such like Wares or Commodities to sell againe, inhabiting within the said City of London or liberties of the same, should be bound by Obligation (with good Sureties) in the summe of one hundred pounds vnto the Register thereafter to be thereunto authorized by the Lord Maior and Aldermen of the said City of London, vnder the Seale of the said City, or to his sufficient Deputie or Deputies, to his Ma∣iesties vse, and so yearly from yeare to yeare, before they should presume to deale or meddle in contra∣cting, buying, or taking to pawne of any Plate, Iewels, Goods, Wares, Merchandizes, Apparrel, houshold stuffe, bookes, bedding, remnants and ends of silkes, veluets, or of linnen or woollen Cloth, or other such like Wares & Commodities: That he, or they, shall and will keep and make a true entry in writing in two seuerall sheets of paper, or more if neede be, in the nature of a duplicate, of all and euery seuerall Contract, bargaine, or pawne to be made or taken by him or them, without omission of any one: And also of the nature, markes, and description of the Commodity, thing or things, bought sold, or impawned, and of the price or summe of monie giuen or lent for the same: and also of the name, mystery, or occupation and dwelling place of the person or persons that shal sell or impawne the same, together with diuers other paines, forfeitures, and ordinances, for the preuenting and suppressing of the inconueniences before declared. All which notwithstanding, it is found by experience, that diuers persons, Brokers, Broggers, or Hucksters, and such other persons as vse to buy or take to pawne old apparrell, houshold-stuffe, bedding, bookes, ends and remnants of silkes, veluets, or of linnen or woollen Cloth, or such like wares to sell againe, haue found diuers waies and meanes to auoid being bound to his Maiesties vse, as in the said Act is directed. And the rather, for that the meanes appoin∣ted by the said Act, to enforce them to become bound, is a penaltie not to bee recouered without suite: which in regard of the proofes of their seuerall Contracts, and the multiplicity of suites will prooue so chargeable and difficult to be vndergone, as that it will hardly bring them to any conformitie: And
forasmuch as the inconueniences arising by meanes of the licentious trading of the saide Broakers, Broggers, & Hucksters, are so dangerous, that it is conceiued verie necessarie and fit for the good of the Commonwealth and publike Weale of this Citie, to prouide fit meanes for preuenting of such a∣buses and strict punishments for such Offenders, thereby to draw them to become conformable: and that there be one cleare and plaine Law made and established, touching the premisses, free from am∣biguity or contradiction, and easie to be vnderstood and obserued. Be it therefore enacted by the Lord Maior, Aldermen, & Commons in this Common Councell assembled, & by the authority of the same, That the said former recited Acts, be from henceforth vtterly voide and repealed. And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid: That from the first day of August now next ensuing, all and euery retayling Broker, Brogger, or Huckster, or other person or persons inhabiting, or which shall inhabit within the Citie of London or liberties of the same, and which shall keepe any shop or roome for the buying or taking to pawne of any old apparrell, houshold stuffe, bedding, bookes, ends and renmants of silks, veluets, or of Linnen or Woollen Cloth, or such like Wares or Commodities to sell againe, or shall vse to buy or take to pawne old apparrell, houshold stuffe, bedding, bookes, and remnants of Silkes, Veluets, or of Linnen or Woollen Cloth, or such like wares and Commodities to sell againe, shall before they shall presume to keepe a Brokers shop, or shall deale or intermeddle in the contracting for buying or taking to pawne of any Plate, Iewels, goods, wares, marchandises, apparrell, houshold stuffe, bookes, bedding, remnants and ends of silks, veluets, or of Linnen or wollen Cloth, and other such like Wares and Commodities, become bound in one Obligation of the summe of one hundreth pounds, to be taken by the Register aforesaide, or his Deputie, in the name of the Chamberlaine of London for the time being, for the true making and keeping of a true and perfect entry in writing in two seuerall sheets of paper, or more if need be, in the nature of a duplicate, of all and euery seueral con∣tract, bargaine, or pawne to be made or taken by him or them, without omission of any one: and also of the nature, markes, and description of the Commoditie, thing or things, bought, solde, or impaw∣ned, and of the price or summe of money giuen or lent for the same: and also of the name, mysterie, or occupation and dwelling place of the person or persons that shall sell or impawne the same, or of the name, mysterie, occupation, and dwelling place, which such person or persons shall affirme him or hir selfe to be of, and this to be done iournally, as euery dayes bargaines, contracts, or pawnes, are inade and taken, vpon paine of forfeiture of the summe of ten pounds weekely, and for euery week that they shall presume to keep a Brokers shop, or to deale or meddle in contracting, for bargaining or taking to pawn, of any Plate, Iewels, goods, wares, marchandices, apparrel, Houshold stuffe, books▪ bedding, remnants and ends of silkes, veluets, or of Linnen or Woollen Cloth, & other such like Wares and Commodities as aforesaid, before they are or shall be so bounden by Obligation, as before is decla∣red: and it shall be lawfull for the said Register and Chamberlain for the time being, to haue and take for the making of euery such Bond, the summe of viii.d. and not aboue, whereof the Register or the Deputie to haue the one halfe for the making and writing, and the Chamberlaine the other halfe, for the keeping of the said bonds, And the saide Broker, Brogger, or Huckster, and such other person, that shal so vse to buy, or take to pawn, old apparrel, houshold stuffe, bedding, bookes, ends, and rem∣nants of Silkes, veluets, or of linnen or woollen cloth, or such like to sell againe, shall bring or cause to be brought, the said Iournall entry exactly and truly made, with the said duplicate thereof once euerie weeke, vpon the day limited to them by the Register authorized, or to be authorized thereunto by the said Lord Maior and Aldermen, vnder the Seale of the said Citie, or to his sufficient Deputie or De∣puties authorized and allowed by the said Lord Maior and Court of Aldermen, and so weekely from time to time, vnto the said Register or his sufficient Deputie or Deputies, with the full fees and du∣ties payable, or to be paid by the true meaning of this Acte: That is to say, One farthing for euerie bargaine, contract, or pawne: for or vpon which, there is or shall bee giuen or lent the summe of one shilling or aboue, and vnder fiue shillings.
