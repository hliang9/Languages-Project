The Letter of Collonel Bridges. Sir be pleased to receave a Relation of the Victory whereof I have now sent an Ex∣presse to the Honourable Committee of both Kingdomes. PRince Maurices Regement, the Refor∣mado troope, Colloel Knottisfords troope, Captaine Wilds troope, and Captaine Gunters troope being sent by the Prince to intercept the convoy of Powder and Match which I sent with the party desighned for Gloucester, And for that end came to Quienton in Gluestershire, but finding the party had passed by some houres before, and having intelligence that all our horse were marched from Warwicke, resolved to  the advantage to plunder the C came to Stratford
upon Avon, and demanded 800 pounds or they would plunder the towne; but upon the present payment of a 10 pounds, Remitted the rest, and came toward Warwick, and in their march swept away all the Beasts they mett withall, of which I haveing notice (being desirous to save the Countrey as well as I could) prevailed with Captaine Andrewes who was then accidentally in Towne with 80 of Newport Horse which were also to March to Gloucester, being also as∣sisted by the committee of Worcestershire with 30 or 40 of Captaine Milwards and Captaine Halfords Troopes, with these and about a dozen of our owne Horse that staid behind our Troope haveing drawne foure companies out of the Towne and Castle, I aduanced towards the Enimie, who by this was come within two miles of Warwicke: haveing in Sherborne Field put themselves in foure considerable Bodyes, and sent a small party away with their plundred Beasts; wee lyned the hedges with our foot and faced them with our Horse neere two houres, in which time, in some loose skirmishes wee haveing killed one and tooke two or three pris∣oners, the Enemy drew of and being to march
through a long lane J caused the foote to ad∣vance, and when the Reare guard tooke the lane, J desired the Horse to charge, which they did accordingly, but the enemy haveing a con∣venient place in the midst of the Lane to draw up a reserve, made good their owne retreat, and beate our men back in some disorder but Major Castle and my selfe hastening up with the foot, and haveing almost Recovered the end of the Lane perceiveing them disordered, J galloped up, and by perswasions and threats, caused the Horse to rally; and make a stand which the enemy perceiving forbore to pursue their ad∣vantage: Whereupon I desired Major Hawks∣worh (who was also accidentally in towne, and behaved himselfe very gallantly in the whole action that hee would hold the enemy in play with the Horse in the Lane, that Major Castle and my selfe might in the interim bring up the foot on the other side of the hedge; But the enemy perceiving our intentions, marched o with out any losse, and drew up a gaine in the next field, and we did the like, and there faced eachother three or foure houres, sometimes skir∣mishing with small parties of Horse, and the
foot otherwhiles sending some Musquet balls amongst them, where by the enemy received some small losse, as we did from their Car∣bines J haveing my Horse also shott: At length I perceiveing the enemies resolution to March a∣way, there being ashort Lane at the end of this Great field through which they must necessarily March: and much troubled to think of the poore Countries losse called the Officers togeather & told them, this was the last opportunity which if lost the Enemy would march cleare away, and therefore desired Major Hawksworth and Captaine Andrewes to be ready when the Ene∣mies Reare guard should come to take the lane to give them a resolute charge and conceiving that if they could put them to the Rout, happily all the rest might thereby be disordered: and in case our hor should be put to the worse, I desired they would retire behinde the foot, which I would cause to advance as fast as I could to coun∣tenance them, and did not doubt through Gods blessing) but to hold up the enemy untill they should have time to rally, and be ready to give, or receive another charge, which they as∣senting to, and I having imparted our resolves to
the severall divisions, caused the foot to advance which the enemy perceiving, and in a greater body then they expected, hasted to make a re∣treat through the lane, but in a very orderly man∣ner. And Major Hawksworth, Captaine An∣drewes, Captaine Milward and some other hors Officers according to the former conclusions took their time so right, and quitted themselves so bravely, as in their first charge they took Pitcher the Captaine of the Reformadoes, who com∣manded the Reer guard, and routed not only that party, but all the rest: killed about ten in the place, and in the persuit (whereof divers were Officers aud men of good quality) wounded ve∣ry many, and divers mortally, tooke neere sixty prisoners, of which many very considerable, 120 horses at least, one horse colours which was all I saw in the field, or could heare of, pursued them 4 or 5 miles, recovered all the plundred beasts, and one cart load of broad cloath, and utterly scattered the remainder of them: so as the Prin∣ces Surgeon that is sent hither to take care of their wounded men, tels us he hath not knowne such a route: some flying to Camden, Evesham, Wor∣cester, Witch, many without Hats, others without
horses, and few with swords, the praise of all which be given to God, who only giveth all victories, I rest. This Victory was obtained Friday the 13 of Aprill 1645 Your humble Servant I. B
