Mrs. JAMES's ADVICE TO THE Citizens of London. GEntlemen of this City, to whom I wish both Health and Happiness, and there is not any thing will rejoyce me more than to have you truly happy; which I doubt not but you will obtain, if you will be so wise as to lay by your Animosities, and to implore the Almighty to direct you; for God loves to be sought to in time of trouble: and not to attribute any thing to man that properly belongs to God; for he must have the Glory of his own Works: Hap∣py are the men that makes the Lord their God, and puts their whole trust in Him; for they shall be guided by his Wisdom to do his Will. But I fear many men in this Distracted Time may not consult that Point. But Gentlemen you know that God cannot contradict himself, therefore it is his Will that the KING should be safe; for he hath declared, Tbat none should touch his Annointed, nor do his Prophets any harm; and altho the King is gone, yet GOD remains; to whom you are obli∣ged to pay all Obedience: and if it is his Wisdom to try you, you must not do as the Children of Israel did when they want∣ed Moses, make to themselves a Golden Calf, and say, This is your God, O Israel, that delivered you out of Bondage: and this thing became a great Sin, because they distrusted God who had delivered them, and trusted in their own handywork; as if he were not able to deliver them still. Let not this be our Con∣dition, but observe what our Blessed Saviour adviseth us, That we should render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods: so that there is a necessity to be just, while you plead Gods Cause, and who knows but that it was the Will of God, to suffer His Majesty to incline towards Rome, that he might be as an Angel to try our Sincerity, and that the Errors of Rome might have a Total Overthrow; but the Sincere to be Convinc'd, and the King to be the Happy In∣strument of Uniting our Differences; and that God that chang'd Nebuchadnezar's Heart, can convince my Soveraign Lord, and make him more Zealous for the Protestant Reli∣gion than ever he was for Rome, which will be your Glory. Therefore, if ever you intend to be Happy and prevent Gods Wrath, decline not your Loyalty, for that is able, by Gods blessing, to convince the King, when he shall see your Sincerity; for how was Saul over-power'd by David, when he cry'd out, That he was more righteous than himself; therefore it is every mans duty to be True to his God, his King and Countrey; and have nothing to do with Popery, which the Lord grant. Amen. Your humble Servant and Souls Well-wisher, ELINOR JAMES
