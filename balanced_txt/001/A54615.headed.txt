A further Assertion of the Propositions concerning the Magnitude, &c. of London, contained in two Essays in Political Arithmetick; mentioned in Philos. Trans∣act. Numb. 183; together with a Vindication of the said Essays from the Objections of some Learned Persons of the French Nation, by Sr. W. Petty Knt. R. S. S. 1. IT could not be expected that an Assertion of Londons being bigger than Paris and Roven, or than Paris and Rome put together, and bigger than any City of the World, should scape uncontradicted, and 'tis expected that I (if continuing in that Perswasion) should make some Reply to these contradictions. 2. I begin with the Ingenious Author of the Novelles de la Republique des Lettres, who saith, that Rey in Persia is far big∣ger than London; for that in the 6th. Century of Christiani∣ty (I suppose An. 550.) It had 15000, or rather 44 thousand Moschees or Mahometan Temples. To which I reply, that I hope this Objector is but in jest, for that Mahomet was not borne till about the Year 570, and had no Moschees till about 50 Years after. 3. The next is the excellent Monsieur Auzout from Rome, who is content, that London, Westminster, and Southwark— with the contiguous Housing may have as many People as Paris and its Suburbs; and but faintly denyeth, that all the Housing within the Bills, may have almost as many People as Paris and Roven, but saith that several Parishes inserted
into these Bills, are distant from, and not contiguous with London, and that Grant so understood it. 4. To which (as his main, if not only Objection) we an∣swer. 1st. That the London Bills appear in Grants Book to have been, since the Year 1636, as they now are. 2. that a∣bout 50 Years since, 3 or 4 Parishes formerly distant, were joyn'd, by interposed Buildings, to the Bulk of the City, and therefore then inserted into the Bills. 3. That since 50 Years the whole Buildings being more than double, have perfect∣ed that Union, so as there is no House within the said Bills, from which one may not call to some other House. 4. All this is confirm'd by Authority of the King and City, and so long Custom. 5. That there are but three Parishes under a∣ny Colour of this Exception, which are scarce a two and fiftieth part of the whole. 5. Upon sight of Monsieur Auzouts large Letter, I made Remarques upon every Paragraph thereof, but suppressing it (because it lookt like a War against one with whome I in∣tended none, whereas in truth it was but a reconciling Ex∣plication of some Doubts, and therefore) I have chosen the shorter and sweeter way of answering Monsieur Auzout, as followeth, viz. Concerning the Number of People in London, as also in Paris, Roven, and Rome, viz. MOnsieur Auzout alleageth an authentick Register, that there are 23223 Houses in Paris, wherein do live above 80 thousand Families, and therefore supposing 3½ Families to live in every of the said Houses one with another; the Number of Families will be 81230; and Mon∣sieur Auzout also allowing 6 Heads to each Family, the utmost Number of People in Paris, according to Mr. Auzout's Opinion, will be.   487680.
The Medium of the Paris Burials was allowed by Monsieur Auzout to be 19887, and that there dyed 3506 unnecessarily out of L'Hotel Dieu, wherefore deducting the said last Number, the neat Standard for Burials at Paris, will be 16381, so as the Number of People there, allowing but one to Dye out of 30 (which is more advantagi∣ous to Paris than Monsieur Auzouts Opinion of one to Dye out of 25) the Number of People at Pa∣ris will be 491430; more than by Monsieur Au∣zouts last mentioned Accompt.   491430. The Medium of the said two Paris Accompts is—   488055. The Medium of the London Burialls is 23212, which Multiplyed by 30 (as hath been done for Paris) the Number of the people there will bee.   696360 The Number of Houses at London appears by the Register to bee 105315. Whereunto adding a 10th. part or 10531, as the least Num∣ber of double Families that can bee supposed in London, the total of Families will be 115840: and allowing 6 Heads for each Family, as was done for Paris, the total of the People at London will be.   695076. The Medium of the 2 last London Accounts is—   695718. The People of Paris according to the above-said Account is 488055.   Of Roven according to Monsieur Auzouts utmost Demand, 80000. 693055. Of Rome according to his own Report thereof. 125000.  
So as there are more People at London, than at Paris, Roven, and Rome by   2663. Memorandum, that the Parishes of Islington, Newington, and Hackney, for which only there is any Colour of Non-contiguity, is not a two and fiftieth part of what is contained in the Bills of Mortality; and consequently London without them, hath more People than Paris and Roven put together, by   114284. Several other Estimates, Viz. I. That London alone is equal to Paris, Roven, and Rome, as aforesaid. II. That London, Bristol, and Dublin are equal to Paris, Amsterdam, and Venice. III. That London alone is to Amsterdam, Venice, and Roven, as 7 to 4. IV. That London and Bristol are equal to any four Cities of France. V. That Dublin is probably equal to the second best Ci∣ty, of any Kingdom or State in Christendome. VI. That London, for ought appears, is the greatest City of the World, but manifestly the greatest Empo∣rium. FINIS
